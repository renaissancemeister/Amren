<h2>Description</h2>
 <p><strong>Note: This book is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Face-Race-Jared-Taylor-ebook/dp/B00OQM9ZHM/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_kin?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414515157&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=face+to+face+with+race">here</a> on Kindle for $4.95.</strong></p>
<p>This is a book about the reality of race in America. It is a collection of 14 reports by ordinary Americans, whose conventional illusions were shattered by harsh experience. These authors have come face to face with the sobering reality that awaits us as our country ceases to have a white majority, and becomes increasingly black and Hispanic. These essays appeared previously in <i>American Renaissance,</i> but are gathered here in one collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Face to Face with Race offers a glimpse into the dark reality behind the happy slogans of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and &ldquo;inclusiveness,&rdquo; as beleaguered whites cope as best they can with the foolish, poisonous, and occasionally lethal policies imposed on them by judges and politicians.&rdquo;  &mdash;  John Derbyshire, social commentator and author, most recently, of <em>We Are Doomed: Reclaiming Conservative Pessimism</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a collection of moving, often heartrending, reports from the front lines of racial battlegrounds in America.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Byron M. Roth, Professor Emeritus, Dowling College, and author of <em>The Perils of Diversity</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;These first-person accounts are more powerful and compelling than any of the hundreds of articles about race I have written from an armchair perspective.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Jared Taylor, Editor of <em>American Renaissance</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a unique collection of stories about inter-racial relations gone bad. The authors warn that eventually, when the United States has a colored majority, almost all whites will face similar problems.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Raymond Wolters, Thomas Muncy Keith Professor of History, University of Delaware</p>
<p>&ldquo;Face to Face with Race is a haunting picture of racial reality. Unless we act soon, this is the future in store for all of us.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Peter Brimelow, Editor of VDARE.com and author <em>Alien Nation</em></p>

<div class="description"><p>Face to Face With Race brings the reader face to face with realities congenial to race realism. These realities are expressed in 14 essays that originally appeared on The American Renaissance website, which is owned by the editor of Face to Face With Race, Jared Taylor. Face to Face With Race demonstrates why diversity can be a weakness.</p>
<p>My chief regret about this anthology is that it did not include an essay by Mary Morrison. She is a public school teacher in the Los Angeles area. She has written several essays for American Renaissance about the persistence of the race gap in academic achievement, yearly and futile efforts to close the race gap, and the way the gap is blamed on teachers, rather than the brutal reality of innate racial inequality.</p>
<p>The insights of these essays are presented as experiences and anecdotes rather than statistics. In his Introduction Jared Taylor wrote, &ldquo;Statistics are not reality; they are only a way to try to interpret reality. It is useful to know that the average black IQ is one standard deviation lower than the average white IQ, but what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of her essays, Mary Morrison wrote of eleventh graders in her school who read at a fourth grade level, while being praised for aspiring to become professionals.</p>
<p>In Christopher Jackson&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;A White Teacher Speaks Out,&rdquo; Christopher Jackson includes a poignant quote from students who tell him, while struggling with an assignment, &ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t do dis Mr. Jackson. I black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it can be dangerous for a white person to publicly agree with Christopher Jackson&rsquo;s students, blacks seem candid in their agreement. In his essay &ldquo;South Africa under Black Rule,&rdquo; Gedaliah Braun wrote, &ldquo;Ask any African why blacks can&rsquo;t for example, make airplanes or computers and he&rsquo;ll look at you as if you were foolish for asking, since the answer is obvious: &lsquo;The white man has the brains for it, and we don&rsquo;t&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Christopher Jackson asked his black students what would happen if whites in the United States suddenly disappeared, one answered, &ldquo;We screwed.&rdquo; The other blacks laughed in agreement.</p>
<p>The message of each of these essays is that racial differences are significant, innate and prevent most blacks from making positive contributions to organizations they belong to. The essays imply that the racial discrimination that existed before the civil rights legislation was passed was not the reason for black inadequacies; it was a legitimate response. Some of them explicitly state that affirmative action advances blacks to positions where they are unable to perform adequately.</p>
<p>At times these inadequacies appear in areas where one might expect blacks to be more proficient than whites. Black athletic prominence, as well as the high rate of black violent crime and gang violence indicate that blacks might make good combat soldiers. This does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Diversity in the Army,&rdquo; retired Army officer Duncan Hengest wrote, &ldquo;One cannot read about the Korean War without running into tales of black units that were unable to hold together under fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The all-black 24th Infantry was notorious for hasty retreats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote, &ldquo;In Iraq, I was repeatedly astonished by the inability of many senior black officers to think through problems.&rdquo; He illustrated this with a suggestion by a black officer in Iraq to use &ldquo;snipers in trees.&rdquo; That black officer had not noticed that there are few trees in Iraq, that they are palm trees, and that palm trees are not appropriate locations for snipers.</p>
<p>Another problem is that blacks usually require retraining in technical matters. Weapons, like nearly every important aspect of our technological society, are more complex than in the past. One needs to have the intelligence to learn complex skills quickly and well.</p>
<p>Blacks in the military are more likely to commit serious crimes. &ldquo;As a peacetime platoon leader, I was always being roped into rape investigations,&rdquo; Duncan Hengest writes. &ldquo;Invariably the suspects were black. Whites would get drunk and rowdy, but I never knew one to be a rapist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another area where black inadequacies cost lives is firefighting. In his essay, &ldquo;Fighting &lsquo;Discrimination&rsquo; Rather Than Fires,&rdquo; Ray Batz claims that firefighting requires more intelligence than most blacks have, and more strength than most women have. In order to increase the numbers of blacks and women in fire fighting, standards have been lowered. He writes, &ldquo;Some women are simply too weak to raise even the 24 foot ladder, one of the lightest in use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward the end of his essay Ray Batz wrote, &ldquo;quota hiring has undoubtedly meant that people have died who did not have to die. Buildings burned that did not have to burn.&rdquo; Here I would have appreciated some statistics demonstrating that fatalities have increased since affirmative action in fire fighting, and that a higher percentage of buildings have burned after fire departments were called.</p>
<p>Ray Batz claimed that &ldquo;It is impossible to know,&rdquo; how the proficiency of fire departments has declined since more blacks and women have been hired. I suspect that statistics compiled by credible organizations exist somewhere on this matter. Adding them would have made his essay stronger, although I am inclined to agree with his assertions.</p>
<p>Because so many people want so strongly to believe that blacks are innately equal to whites, and that affirmative action is a legitimate corrective to previous discrimination, it is necessary to go into factual detail about how affirmative action policies advance blacks to positions where they cannot perform adequately. This requires numbers in addition to subjective evaluations. If someone dislikes a person or group one is prone to underestimate that person&rsquo;s or group&rsquo;s capabilities. The same is true in reverse, of course.</p>
<p>In his essay, &ldquo;Blacks and High Steel,&rdquo; Tom Dilberger writes that when apprenticeships in iron working for sky scrapers were opened to blacks, &ldquo;they all failed.&rdquo; Unfortunately a judge, who naturally knew nothing about iron working, ruled that standards had to be reduced for blacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When black men started filtering on to the job, it was clear from the beginning that they had no ability to do the work,&rdquo; Tom Dilberger writes. &ldquo;Before long, it became impossible to fire any but the very worst. Courts mandated that a certain percentage of the workforce, especially on government jobs, be made up of black men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who advocate affirmative action necessarily lie about it. They say it does not discriminate against white men, but it does. They say that it does not advance blacks and women to positions where they are not able to perform adequately, but it does. This is an area where statistics and documentation are necessary, because so many people want desperately to believe otherwise.</p>
<p>Denis Ruiz begins his essay, &ldquo;Displaced: A White American Talks About Home,&rdquo; with, &ldquo;I grew up in the 1950&rsquo;s in a little town called Fairveiw Village in south Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because blacks moved in, &ldquo;The neighborhood where I grew up in is now a wastelandâ¦</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently, a black teenager knocked my mother to the ground, injuring her, and took her purse. That sort of thing was unheard of in the old neighborhood, but it is common now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am sure this is true. Nevertheless, statistics on how crime rates have increased in Fairview Village, New Jersey since the 1950&rsquo;s would have made this a stronger essay.</p>
<p>In his essay, &ldquo;South Africa under Black Rule,&rdquo; Gedaliah Braun, who is a philosophy professor in South Africa, writes, &ldquo;Probably the most significant direct effect of black rule has been the dramatic rise in crime, primarily black-on-white crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The official story in the United States has been that since apartheid ended in 1994 the people of South Africa have lived happily ever after. I would like to know how the murder rate, the per capita gross domestic product, and the median income adjusted for inflation have changed since 1994. These are statistics for which there is fairly accurate data historically and geographically. Gedaliah Braun wrote his essay four years after the end of apartheid. Twenty years after 1994 I would like for someone to document and discuss these tangible areas where we can judge the results of ending apartheid.</p>
<p>My response to Tracy Abel&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;The Wages of Idealism&rdquo; is admittedly complex. Tracy Abel wrote about her experiences working for an organization called &ldquo;Safe Horizon.&rdquo; This is a day care center for victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Safe Horizon reminds me superficially of the Community for Creative Non Violence in Washington, DC. I have not had any association with CCNV since the early 1970&rsquo;s. Back then CCNV was, if you can imagine such a thing, a Roman Catholic urban commune loosely affiliated with the University of George Washington and the University of Georgetown, and engaged in anti war activism.</p>
<p>I met members of CCNV at a coffee house I patronized. On Sundays they would hold folk masses at their headquarters. These would be followed by a pot luck supper. I frequently attended these. The only members of CCNV who were sexually intimate were married to each other. I briefly dated a woman I met there. We never touched each other.</p>
<p>Since the end of the War in Vietnam the Community for Creative Non Violence has become involved with helping homeless people and with homeless advocacy.</p>
<p>I mention this because Tracy Abel did not like the people she worked with at Safe Horizon. She did not like the people they helped. I wonder how people who remembered her at Safe Horizon would describe her. I wonder how she would describe the Community for Creative Non Violence.</p>
<p>This is why statistics are important. How we look at individuals, organizations, and groups of people is influenced by what we look with. Our feelings influence our reality perceptions. That is why we benefit by backing up our feelings with facts that can be documented.</p>
