            <p><font size="3">&#147;WAS THE MUGGER black?&#148; 
              asked my wife sympathetically. As a Canadian newly arrived in Manhattan, 
              she honestly didn&rsquo;t know that you must Never Ask. Her hostess, 
              caught off balance in mid-crime story, admitted that he was. Then 
              she hurriedly covered herself: of course, she said, this meant nothing.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Besides being a Canadian, however, 
              my wife was and still is in some respects invincibly innocent. And 
              now she was really puzzled. &#147;But aren&rsquo;t most muggers in 
              New York black?&#148; she inquired. Her hostess was outraged. &#147;I 
              don&rsquo;t believe that,&#148; she snapped.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The single greatest strength of 
              Jared Taylor&rsquo;s<i> Paved with Good Intentions</i> is its massive 
              and merciless crushing of this type of hysterical denial, which 
              currently paralyzes all discussion of race relations in America. 
              Considered entirely by itself, this achievement makes his book the 
              most important to be published on the subject for many years. In 
              this area, experience shows that it is not enough to be mugged by 
              reality. Footnotes are apparently necessary as well. And Taylor 
              provides 1,339 of them, quarried from a remarkably wide reading 
              of contemporary sources.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Thus it is indeed true that blacks 
              commit most of New York&rsquo;s violent crime. Even a decade before 
              my wife arrived in Manhattan, by the early 1970s, blacks already 
              made up over 60 per cent of those arrested for violent crime, but 
              only 20 per cent of the city&rsquo;s population. And more recently, 
              for example, black men have been responsible for over 85 per cent 
              of the felonies committed against New York City cabbies, as many 
              as 17 of whom are murdered each year. Nationwide, blacks&mdash;although 
              only 12 per cent of the population&mdash;account for 64 per cent 
              of all violent-crime arrests and 71 per cent of all robbery arrests.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">But isn&rsquo;t this because the 
              police are racist? Apparently not. Taylor hunts down and extirpates 
              all such infinitely regressing excuses, which have for too long 
              substituted for thought in American political discourse. In this 
              case, for example, he proves via a closely reasoned analysis, based 
              on witness reports and arrest patterns for burglaries, traffic violations 
              and drunkenness, that policemen of all races are, if anything, more 
              lenient with criminals of a different race from themselves. (Which, 
              of course, is just what you would expect, given current political 
              pressures.)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Nor is the disparity caused by middle-class 
              law enforcers over-concentrating on street crime. In 1990, blacks 
              were nearly three times as likely as whites to be arrested for white-collar 
              crimes such as forgery, counterfeiting, and embezzlement. And, finally 
              and conclusively, blacks themselves are responsible for 73 per cent 
              of all justified, self-defense killings. The vast majority of the 
              people they kill are other blacks.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">A fascinating Orwellian double-think 
              enabled my wife&rsquo;s hostess to evade this reality&mdash;although 
              in her conduct she certainly took account of it every day on Manhattan&rsquo;s 
              streets. But this doublethink is no mere harmless self-delusion. 
              As in 1984, it requires the constant support of an extraordinary 
              censorship and self-censorship.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Media bias is a subject that easily 
              becomes boring to sophisticates. But the inversions of truth here 
              documented by Taylor are so extreme as to be pathological. Thus 
              he is able to show that every one of the recent alleged white-racist 
              atrocities&mdash;Howard Beach, Bensonhurst, Rodney King&mdash;had 
              black-on-white analogies that went virtually unreported, although 
              often far worse. For example, Taylor tracks several years of self-feeding 
              press references to the heinous scandal of a white Stanford student 
              hanging a caricatured blackface Beethoven on the door of a black 
              student (who, as it happens, had insisted Beethoven was black). 
              An entire &#147;campus racism&#148; industry has been called into 
              existence on the strength of such trivia. But who has heard of the 
              four black University of Arizona football players, three of them 
              on scholarships, whose hobby of beating up lone campus whites landed 
              them in jail in 1989?</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Or for that matter of the Miami-based 
              Yahweh cult, whose leader was convicted in 1992 for causing his 
              followers to kill numerous &#147;white devils&#148;&mdash;without 
              benefit of even a fraction of the network prime time devoted to 
              endless reruns of the (dishonestly edited) King-beating video.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">This powerful combination of internal 
              and external compulsion is literally able to turn black into white. 
              Thus in 1987 Tawana Brawley, the black teenager who claimed she 
              had been abducted by a white gang, was able, despite the increasing 
              absurdity of her attorneys&rsquo; allegations, to focus the attention 
              of the entire country on the supposedly grave issue of white-on-black 
              rape. But in fact it was a complete chimera. In 1988, there were 
              fewer than ten [PB in 2000: in fact, probably a few score] cases 
              of white-on-black rape&mdash;as opposed to 9,405 cases of black-on-white 
              rape. Taylor reports that black men appear three to four times more 
              likely to commit rape than whites, and more than sixty times more 
              likely to rape a white than a white is likely to rape a black.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Taylor&rsquo;s storm of statistics 
              puts in perspective the view that blacks themselves are the chief 
              victims of black crime. That claim is almost true. In America, blacks 
              account for just under half of murder victims. Any decent person 
              will feel a particular sympathy for respectable black people who 
              are likely to suffer the effects both of black crime and of white 
              suspicion prompted by black crime. But their plight is merely one 
              consequence&mdash;though a harsh one&mdash;of the crisis of black 
              society. Homicide is now the leading cause of death for black men 
              between 15 and 44; one in four black men in their twenties is either 
              in jail, on probation, or on parole. Syphilis is fifty times more 
              prevalent among blacks than among whites; black children are twice 
              as likely as whites to die in their first year.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">And this black crisis still disproportionately 
              hurts whites. Black criminals choose white victims in more than 
              half of their violent crime; the average black criminal seems over 
              12 times more likely to kill a white than vice versa.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The second major contribution of 
              Taylor&rsquo;s book is its frontal assault on the universal assumption 
              that &#147;white racism&#148; is to blame for everything. In effect, 
              he proposes a logical-positivist&rsquo;s test: since this racism 
              is (as he demonstrates) publicly illegal, privately undetectable 
              in opinion polls, and does not seem materially to affect the economic 
              status of blacks once that status is adjusted for education and 
              other variables, in what sense does it exist?</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Taylor documents in immense detail 
              that the U.S., far from suppressing its blacks and poor, in fact 
              subsidizes them, publicly and privately, including more than $2.5 
              trillion in federal moneys alone since the 1960s. This, notoriously, 
              has done little good and much ill. But it is hardly the behavior 
              of a racist society&mdash;unless liberal politicians, welfare bureaucrats, 
              and academics have deliberately sought to destroy black society 
              by spreading dependency and pauperism.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The truth may set us free. But it 
              can also make us sick. Many people will unquestionably find Taylor&rsquo;s 
              ruthless exposition of black failure more than they can stomach. 
              One such is the Institute for Justice&rsquo;s Clint Bolick, who has 
              written very sensibly about civil rights, but who recently reproached 
              Taylor in the Wall Street Journal for dismissing &#147;the continuing 
              impact of racism, which most blacks face every day of their lives.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Grant that blacks suffer occasional 
              slights, crude name-calling, and some discrimination. But how damaging 
              are these compared to the self-inflicted wounds of black America? 
              And what prompts this white behavior? Is endemic white racism any 
              more reasonable an explanation for the situation than endemic black 
              criminality and the defensive nervous hostility it produces among 
              whites?</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;Race is the great American 
              dilemma,&#148; Taylor writes, echoing Gunnar Myrdal&rsquo;s famous 
              survey, An American Dilemma. Nearly fifty years later, Myrdal&rsquo;s 
              panacea of integration, equality, and confident social engineering 
              has been followed by disaster. This news could not be more unwelcome. 
              It is hardly surprising that both Left and (alleged) Right prefer 
              to cling to the myth of a culpable&mdash;but therefore at least in 
              theory correctable&mdash;white racist America.</font></p>
