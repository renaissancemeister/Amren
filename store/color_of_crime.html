				<h2>Major Findings:</h2> 
				<p>
					&#149; Police and the justice system are not biased against minorities. 
				</p>
				<h3>Crime Rates</h3> 
				<p>
					&#149; Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; When blacks commit crimes of violence, they are nearly three times more likely than non-blacks to use a gun, and more than twice as likely to use a knife. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate, and Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; The single best indicator of violent crime levels in an area is the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic. 
				</p>
				<h3>Interracial Crime</h3> 
				<p>
					&#149; Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa. 
				</p>
				<h3>Gangs</h3> 
				<p>
					&#149; Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely. 
				</p>
				<h3>Incarceration</h3> 
				<p>
					&#149; Between 1980 and 2003 the US incarceration rate more than tripled, from 139 to 482 per 100,000, and the number of prisoners increased from 320,000 to 1.39 million. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#149; Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. Hispanics are three times more likely.
