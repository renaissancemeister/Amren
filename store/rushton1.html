            <p><font size="3"><i> R</i></font><i><font size="3">ace, 
              Evolution, and Behavior</font></i><font size="3"> is one of the best 
              books ever written about on race. It marshals statisticson race 
              differences and provides a comprehensive gene-based evolutionary 
              theory to explain them. It may startle many people to learn just 
              how much information we have on race differences in brain size, 
              intelligence, sexuality, personality, growth rate, life span, crime, 
              and family stability. Also surprising to many will be the consistency 
              with which, on all of these traits, Orientals fall at one end of 
              the spectrum, blacks at the other end, and whites in between.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">On average, Orientals are slower 
              to mature, less fertile, and less sexually active, have larger brains 
              and higher IQ scores. Blacks are at the opposite end in each of 
              these areas, and whites fall in the middle, often close to Orientals. 
              This pattern is true over time and across nations and this means 
              we cannot ignore it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><i>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</i> 
              shows that Oriental children are slower to mature than white children 
              while black children are faster to mature. This is true for the 
              rate of bone and tooth development and the age at which a child 
              first sits, crawls, walks, and puts on clothing. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">There are also racial differences 
              in sexual activity. Orientals are the least sexually active, whether 
              measured by age of first intercourse, intercourse frequency, or 
              number of sexual partners. Blacks are the most active on all of 
              these measures. Once again whites fall in between. These contrasts 
              in sexual activity lead to differences in the rate of diseases like 
              syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, and chlamydia. There are high levels 
              of AIDS in Africa, black America, and the Caribbean and low levels 
              in China and Japan. European countries again fall in between.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The races differ in rate of ovulation. 
              Not all women produce one egg during the menstrual cycle. When two 
              or more eggs are produced at the same time, a pregnancy is more 
              likely. So is the likelihood of producing fraternal twins (i.e., 
              two-egg twins). The number of twins born is 16 out of every 1,000 
              births for blacks, 8 out of every 1,000 births for whites, and 4 
              or less for Orientals. Triplets and other multiple births are rarest 
              in Orientals and highest in blacks, with whites in between.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Much of <i>Race, Evolution, and 
              Behavior</i> is about race and intelligence. Hundreds of studies 
              on millions of people show a three-way pattern. IQ tests are often 
              made to have an average score of 100, with a &#147;normal&#148; 
              range from 85 to 115. Whites average from 100 to 103. Orientals 
              in Asia and the U.S. tend to have higher scores, about 106. Blacks 
              in the U.S., the Caribbean, Britain, Canada, and in Africa average 
              lower IQs&mdash;about 85. The lowest average IQs are found for sub-Saharan 
              Africans&mdash;from 70 to 75.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Prof. Rushton also looks at brain 
              size. Bigger brains have more brain cells and this leads to higher 
              IQs. The races vary in brain size. Some of the reviewed studies 
              are very large. For example, the U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project 
              followed more than 50,000 children from birth to age seven years. 
              Orientals had larger brains than whites at birth, four months, one 
              year, and seven years. Whites had larger brains than blacks at all 
              ages. In another large study this racial ranking was confirmed in 
              a random stratified sample of 6,325 U.S. Army personnel.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Up until recently most work on race 
              was carried out in the U.S. on differences between whites and blacks. 
              Beginning in the 1970s, however, race research became become global. 
              New statistics emerged on East Asians in the United States, as well 
              as from Hong Kong and Japan. Also, more data began to come in from 
              black populations in Africa, the Caribbean, and Britain. All the 
              data consistently showed a 3-way pattern of race differences.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">In the U.S. Orientals are a &#147;model 
              minority.&#148; They have fewer divorces, fewer out-of&mdash;wedlock 
              births, and fewer reports of child abuse than whites. More Orientals 
              graduate from college and fewer go to prison. On the other hand 
              blacks are 12 percent of the American population and make up 50 
              percent of the prison population. In the U.S., one out of every 
              three black men is either in jail, on probation, or awaiting trial. 
              That is much more than the number who graduate from college.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><i>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</i> 
              shows that this racial pattern in crime is found worldwide. INTERPOL 
              Yearbooks show that violent crime rates are four times lower in 
              Asian and Pacific Rim countries than in African and Caribbean countries. 
              Whites in the United States and in European countries are in between.</font></p>
            <p><b><font size="3">Why Are There Race Differences?</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="3">Why does history show Africa trailing 
              behind Asia and Europe? Why do whites average between Orientals 
              and blacks in so many areas? Why do the groups with larger brains 
              have lower rates of two-egg twinning? To know the answer, you must 
              look at all of the traits taken together because they form a pattern. 
              No environmental factor can explain all of them taken together. 
              There is, however, a gene based explanation. The patterns make up 
              what is called a &#147;life-history.&#148; They evolved together 
              to meet the trials of life&mdash;survival, growth, and reproduction.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><i>Race, Evolution, and Behavior</i> 
              proposes a gene based &#147;life-history theory&#148; to explain 
              the racial pattern in brain size, intelligence, and other traits. 
              Evolutionary biologists call it the r-K scale of reproductive strategies. 
              At one end of this scale are r-strategies that rely on high reproductive 
              rates. At the other end are K-strategies that rely on high levels 
              of parental care.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">On this scale, Orientals are more 
              K-selected than whites, while whites are more K-selected than blacks. 
              Highly K-selected women produce fewer eggs (and have bigger brains) 
              than r-selected women. Highly K-selected men invest time and energy 
              in their children rather than the pursuit of sexual thrills. They 
              are &#147;dads&#148; rather than &#147;cads.&#148; These race differences 
              in reproductive strategies make sense in terms of human evolution. 
              Modern humans are thought to have evolved in Africa about 200,000 
              years ago. Africans and non-Africans then split about 100,000 years 
              ago. Orientals and whites split about 40,000 years ago.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The more north the people went &#147;out 
              of Africa,&#148; the harder it was to get food, gain shelter, make 
              clothes, and raise children. So the groups that evolved into today&rsquo;s 
              whites and Orientals needed larger brains, more family stability, 
              and a longer life. But building a bigger brain takes time and energy 
              during development. So, these changes were balanced by slower rates 
              of growth, lower levels of sex hormones, less aggression, and less 
              sexual activity.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Why? Because Africa, Europe, and 
              Asia had very different climates and geographies that called for 
              different skills, resource usage, and lifestyles. Blacks evolved 
              in a tropical climate which contrasted with the cooler climate of 
              Europe in which whites evolved and even more so with the cold Arctic 
              lands where Orientals evolved.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Because intelligence increased the 
              chances of survival in harsh winter environments, the groups that 
              left Africa had to evolve greater intelligence and family stability. 
              This called for larger brains, slower growth rates, lower hormone 
              levels, less sexual potency, less aggression, and less impulsiveness. 
              Advanced planning, self-control, rule-following, and longevity all 
              increased in the non-Africans.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Finally it is worth mentioning that 
              in Chapter 4 of the unabridged edition (not covered in the abridged 
              version) the author presents his &#147;genetic similarity theory&#148; 
              to explain ethnic nationalism. It likens &#147;races&#148; to extended 
              families. Prof. Rushton shows that genes influence why people tend 
              to marry and associate with others like themselves. The important 
              pull of genetic similarity can be felt in small groups and even 
              large ones (national and international). The reason people like 
              and seek genetic similarity and fear and avoid dissimilarity is 
              to be found in the sociobiology of altruism. Altruism toward genetically 
              similar others evolved in order to help replicate similar genes 
              (extended kin). Xenophobia is then seen as the &lsquo;dark side&rsquo; 
              of human altruism. Because ethnic nationalism is part of human nature, 
              the world may face an unending series of upheavals as more and more 
              peoples rise to ethnic self-consciousness.</font></p>

              published in June 2000 by the Charles Darwin Research Institute, 
              provide the most up-to-date research on this critical topic. The 
              unabridged edition contains over 1,000 references to the scholarly 
              literature, a glossary, complete name and subject indexes, and 65 
              charts, maps, tables, and figures. It is an essential reference 
              book for anyone seeking a profession treatment of the subject of 
              race. The 3rd edition provides a 30-page preface that summarizes 
              the main scientific findings since the 2nd edition (1997), which 
              in turn had a 21-page afterword updating the science since the 1st 
              edition (1995).</font></p>
