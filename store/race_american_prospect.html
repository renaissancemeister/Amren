					Fourteen authors  &mdash;  leading scholars and experts on race and ethnicity  &mdash;  reflect on how race and ethnic differences have shaped America&rsquo;s cultural, historical, and political landscape. Each contributor examines the impact of racial differences on American society, from religion and politics to Southern history and sociobiology, and explains the significance of race as a crucial factor in forging America&rsquo;s national character.

				<h3>From the Introduction by Samuel Francis:</h3> 
				<p>
					&ldquo;In the Victorian era, the Great Taboo was sex. Today, whatever the label we attach to our own age, the Great Taboo is race. The Victorians virtually denied that sex existed. Today, race is confidently said to be &lsquo;merely a social construct,&rsquo; a product of the imagination, and of none too healthy imaginations at that, rather than a reality of nature. The Victorians severely punished people who talked about sex, made jokes about sex, or wrote too openly and frankly about sex. Today, journalists, disc jockeys, leading sports figures, public officials, distinguished academics, and major political leaders who violate the racial taboos of our age are fired from their newspapers, networks, or radio stations, forced to resign their positions, condemned by their own colleagues, and subjected to &lsquo;investigations&rsquo; of the &lsquo;backgrounds&rsquo; and their &lsquo;links&rsquo; to other individuals and groups that have also violated the race taboo. We have not, at least in this country so far, reached the point where violating the race taboo brings criminal prosecution and imprisonment, as in both Europe and Canada it may well do, but there are several cases of supposed &lsquo;white supremacists&rsquo; being arrested or harassed by law enforcement agencies largely because of their alleged beliefs about race, and the constant agitation for ever more stringent measures against &lsquo;hate crimes&rsquo; and &lsquo;hate speech&rsquo; seems to point toward the eventual official entrenchment of the race taboo in criminal law. Meanwhile, if the government is still restricted in the action it can take to stifle and suppress &lsquo;racism,&rsquo; the &lsquo;anti-racist&rsquo; political left seems to enjoy virtual carte blanche to denounce, vilify, spy on, demonstrate against, intimidate, and even occasionally assault and beat up individuals and organizations that have transgressed the racial Victorianism of our age. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;If the analogy between the Victorian taboo on sex and the contemporary taboo on race is valid, then the essays in this book are logically the analogue of pornography, or what conventional Victorians regarded as pornography. Every one of these essays deals with race in a way that the dominant culture of the present day rejects, forbids, and indeed punishes by one means or another. Every one of them deals with aspects of race  &mdash;  its reality as a part of the biological and psychological nature of man and its importance as a social and historical force  &mdash;  that contemporary culture is at best reluctant to discuss at all and absolutely refuses to acknowledge as true. At the same time, in contradiction to the stereotype promoted by &lsquo;anti-racist&rsquo; forces, not one of these essays or their authors expresses here or anywhere else any desire to harm, exploit, dominate, or deny the legitimate rights of other races. This book is not a tract promoting &lsquo;white supremacy&rsquo; or the restoration of forced segregation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;All the contributors to this volume are white, well educated, and articulate; several are or have been academics or professional journalists and authors, and what unites and drives them as a group is a common concern that their race today faces a crisis that within the coming century and in the United States and Europe could easily lead to either its physical extinction, its subordination to and persecution by other races, or the destruction of its civilization. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Most readers who continue to believe what the dominant culture tells them about the meaning and significance of race will find this concern bizarre. They will at once respond that in the first place, as noted, race does not really exist or, if it does, that it consists of nothing more than superficial and socially irrelevant features of gross physical morphology  &mdash;  skin color, hair texture, height, perhaps skull shape, etc. Even if race does exist as a biological reality, it certainly has no meaning for behavior, culture, intelligence, or other traits that influence and shape social institutions. Moreover, any effort to take race more seriously is either a deliberate and covert attempt to justify racial hatred or injustice, or is at best a misguided enterprise that is all too likely to lead to hatred, injustice, and even genocide, as it has in the past. This is the conventional attitude toward race that the dominant culture in the West today promotes and enforces, and it is precisely from that attitude and its unspoken premises that the authors of these essays dissent.&rdquo;
