				<span class="dropcap">T</span>en years in the making, this book is the sequel to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s seminal <i>Paved With Good Intentions.</i> In <i>White Identity</i> Taylor steers even further into forbidden territory, as he systematically marshals the data to show that:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> People of all races pay lip service to the ideal of integration but generally prefer to remain apart. </li>
				<li> Study after scientific study suggests that racial identity is an inherent part of human nature. </li>
				<li> Diversity of race, language, religion, etc. is not a strength for America but a source of chronic tension and conflict. </li>
				<li> Non-whites  &mdash;  especially blacks and Hispanics but now even Asians  &mdash;  openly take pride in their race and put group interests ahead of those of the country as a whole. </li>
				<li> Only whites continue to believe that it is possible or even desirable to transcend race and try to make the United States a nation in which race does not matter. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Taylor argues that America must reassess dated assumptions, and that we need policies based on a realistic understanding of race, not on fantasies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most provocatively, Taylor argues that whites must exercise the same rights as other groups  &mdash;  that they must be unafraid of considering their own legitimate interests. He concludes by warning whites that if they do not defend their interests they will be marginalized by groups that do not hesitate to assert themselves, numerically and culturally.

						Jared Taylor is arguably the most brilliant of the leaders of what is sometimes called the &ldquo;Alternative Right,&rdquo; the intellectual movement focused on emergent issues that are now systematically suppressed in America&rsquo;s purblind public debate. This book, the long-awaited sequel to his seminal <i>Paved With Good Intentions,</i> will eventually be seen as a decisive step forward on the historic American nation&rsquo;s road to recovery from the paralyzing curse of Political Correctness.

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						In this brilliant and wide-ranging survey of the relevant science and history, Jared Taylor shows that racial consciousness is intrinsic and that efforts to remake human nature are doomed to fail. He shows that in modern America, people of all races prefer the company of people of their own race; that racial diversity is more often a source of conflict than of strength; and that multiculturalism is changing the United States profoundly and to the detriment of most white people.

						The work of an insightful, well-tempered, and above all, demandingly honest mind, <i>White Identity</i> is especially timely as the white population of America comes under intensifying demographic, political, cultural, and economic pressure from both within and without. Jared Taylor deserves our deep gratitude for declaring that whites must find a way to stand up for themselves in a world in which they are becoming a shrinking minority, even in their own once white-majority countries.

						Jared Taylor offers the reader an open, honest, and frank discussion of the reality of race and race relations in America today. He convincingly argues that unless all the facts, painful or politically inconvenient though they may be, are laid bare then all that follows will be based on false assumptions and doomed to failure.

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>White Identity</i> makes shocking and painful reading for any white person who fears for the future of the United States. It is about the relentless demise of whites, about the loss of will to survive, even about the death of whites globally. As Jared Taylor demonstrates in a relentless barrage of data and statistics, whites are being racially, culturally and physically dispossessed by non-whites. The acceptance of multiculturalism as something beneficial when it is barely concealed and often explicit anti-white racism renders whites uniquely vulnerable to the organized racial solidarity of non-whites.
					</p>
					<p>
						I retain hope. I retain this hope because of the author himself. Jared Taylor embodies all the virtues that made the American Republic: physical courage, wisdom, love of learning, an indomitable spirit and point-blank refusal to live by the Lie.

						Jared Taylor documents the dire consequences of demographic change in the United States. He warns of the deterioration that will follow when and if whites become a minority, and sounds a much needed wake-up call for whites to regain their sense of racial consciousness.
