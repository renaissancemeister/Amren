<h1 class="title">Fugitive is an Anti-Racist Who Favors Gun Control</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, February 8, 2013</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Race is clearly part of Christopher Dorner&rsquo;s craziness.</div> 
</div> 


<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Christopher Dorner has published an </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://laist.com/2013/02/07/christopher_dorners_manifesto_in_fu.php">11,000-word statement</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> on Facebook. It is addressed to &ldquo;America&rdquo; and the subject is &ldquo;Last resort,&rdquo; and it explains why he declared war on the Los Angeles Police Department. His foul-mouthed ramblings also show that Mr. Dorner is an anti-racist liberal who is deeply confused about race in America.</span></p>
<p>Mr. Dorner was fired for making false statements about a superior officer, whom he accused of mistreating a suspect. His statement goes on at furious length about this, complaining that &ldquo;terminating me for telling the truth of a Caucasian officer kicking a mentally ill man is disgusting.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_103063" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Dorner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-103063" alt="Christopher Dorner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Dorner.jpg" width="540" height="386"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Christopher Dorner</p></div>
<p>The statement covers many other subjects, and, as some media reports have mentioned, Mr. Dorner wrote about politicians, newsmen, and TV programs. Far less widely reported is what he wrote about race. For example, he feels strongly about being black:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was the only black kid in each of my elementary school classes from first grade to seventh grade in junior high and any instances where I was disciplined for fighting was in response to fellow students provoking common childhood schoolyard fights, or calling me a nigger or other derogatory racial names. I grew up in neighborhoods where blacks make up less than 1%. My first recollection of racism was in the first grade at Norwalk Christian elementary school in Norwalk, CA. A fellow student,   &mdash;  - [in the publicly-available version of the statement, people&rsquo;s names are replaced with dashes] if I can recall, called me a nigger on the playground. My response was swift and non-lethal. I struck him fast and hard with a punch an kick. He cried and reported it to a teacher. The teacher reported it to the principal. The principal swatted   &mdash;  - for using a derogatory word toward me. He then for some unknown reason swatted me for striking   &mdash;  - in response to him calling me a nigger. He stated as good Christians we are to turn the other cheek as Jesus did. Problem is, I&rsquo;m not a fucking Christian and that old book, made of fiction and limited non-fiction, called the bible, never once stated Jesus was called a nigger.</p></blockquote>
<p>He claims that he was called a &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; while he was a police officer:</p>
<blockquote><p>While traveling back to the station in a 12 passenger van I heard   &mdash;  - refer to another individual as a nigger. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I heard correctly as there were many conversations in the van that was compiled of at least 8 officers and he was sitting in the very rear and me in the very front. Even with the multiple conversations and ambient noise I heard Officer   &mdash;  - call an indivdual a nigger again. Now that I had confirmed it, I told   &mdash;  - not to use that word again. I explained that it was a well-known offensive word that should not be used by anyone. He replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it when I want&rdquo;. Officer   &mdash;  -, a friend of his, also stated that he would say nigger when he wanted. At that point I jumped over my front passenger seat and two other officers where I placed my hands around   &mdash;  -&rsquo; neck and squeezed. I stated to   &mdash;  -, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fucking say that&rdquo;. At that point there was pushing and shoving and we were separated by several other officers. What I should have done, was put a Winchester Ranger SXT 9mm 147 grain bullet in his skull and Officer   &mdash;  -&rsquo;s skull. The Situation would have been resolved effective, immediately.</p>
<p>The saddest part of this ordeal was that Officer   &mdash;  - and   &mdash;  - were only given 22 day suspensions and are still LAPD officers to this day. That day, the LAPD stated that it is acceptable for fellow officers to call black officers niggers to their face and you will receive a slap on the wrist.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, there have been no public reports that throw any light on this alleged incident.</p>
<p>Mr. Dorner clearly thinks race had a lot to do with why he was fired:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why did you terminate an honest officer and cover for a dishonest officer who victimized a mentally ill citizen.</p>
<p>Sometimes humans feel a need to prove they are the dominant race of a species and they inadvertently take kindness for weakness from another individual. You chose wrong.</p>
<p>Terminating officers because they expose a culture of lying, racism (from the academy), and excessive use of force will immediately change. PSB [Public Safety Bureau] can not police their own and that has been proven. The blue line will forever be severed and a cultural change will be implanted. You have awoken a sleeping giant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dorner does not, however, entirely blame whites for having a low opinion of blacks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bill Cosby, you are a reasonable and talented man who has spoken the truth of the cultural anomalies within the black communities that need to change now. The black communities&rsquo; resentment toward you is because they don&rsquo;t like hearing the truth or having their clear and evident dirty laundry aired to the nation. The problem is, the country is not blind nor dumb. They believe we are animals. Do not mute your unvarnished truthful speech or moral compass. Blacks must strive for more in life than bling, hoes, and cars. The current culture is an epidemic that leaves them with no discernible future. They&rsquo;re suffocating and don&rsquo;t even know it. MLK Jr. Would be mortified at what he worked so hard for in our acceptance as equal beings and how unfortunately we stopped progressing and began digressing. Chicago&rsquo;s youth violence is a prime example of how our black communities values have declined. We can not address this nation&rsquo;s intolerant issues until we address our own communities morality issues first. Accountability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dorner clearly thinks of himself as a crusading anti-racist. Here he recounts another incident for which there is no publicly available independent confirmation:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the BOR [Board of Rights, the final stage in the appeal process he went through to avoid being fired from the LAPD], the department attempted to label me unsuccessfully as a bully. They stated that I had bullied a recruit,   &mdash;  -, in the academy when in reality and unfounded disposition from the official 1.28 [the form number for complaints against the Los Angeles police] formal complaint investigation found that I was the one who stood up for   &mdash;  - when other recruits sang nazi hitler youth songs about burning Jewish ghettos in WWII Germany where his father was a survivor of a concentration camp. How fucking dare you attempt to label me with such a nasty vile word. I ask that all earnest journalist investigating this story ask Ofcr.   &mdash;  - about the incident when Ofcr.   &mdash;  - began singing a nazi youth song about burning jewish ghettos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dorner takes Trayvon Martin&rsquo;s side against George Zimmerman: &ldquo;Too bad Trayvon didn&rsquo;t smash your skull completely open, Zim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Dorner explains why he plans to kill police officers. No race is exempt from his murder campaign, because <i>all</i> are prejudiced and bigoted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Those Caucasian officers who join South Bureau divisions (77th,SW,SE, an Harbor) with the sole intent to victimize minorities who are uneducated, and unaware of criminal law, civil law, and civil rights. You prefer the South bureau because a use of force/deadly force is likely and the individual you use UOF [use of force] on will likely not report it. You are a high value target.</p>
<p>Those Black officers in supervisory ranks and pay grades who stay in south bureau (even though you live in the valley or OC [Orange County]) for the sole intent of getting retribution toward subordinate caucasians officers for the pain and hostile work environment their elders inflicted on you as probationers (P-1′s) and novice P-2&rsquo;s. You are a high value target. You perpetuated the cycle of racism in the department as well. You breed a new generation of bigoted caucasian officer when you belittle them and treat them unfairly.</p>
<p>Those Hispanic officers who victimize their own ethnicity because they are new immigrants to this country and are unaware of their civil rights. You call them wetbacks to their face and demean them in front of fellow officers of different ethnicities so that you will receive some sort of acceptance from your colleagues. I&rsquo;m not impressed. Most likely, your parents or grandparents were immigrants at one time, but you have forgotten that. You are a high value target.</p>
<p>Those lesbian officers in supervising positions who go to work, day in day out, with the sole intent of attempting to prove your misandrist authority (not feminism) to degrade male officers. You are a high value target.</p>
<p>Those Asian officers who stand by and observe everything I previously mentioned other officers participate in on a daily basis but you say nothing, stand for nothing and protect nothing. Why? Because of your usual saying, &rdquo; I……don&rsquo;t like conflict&rdquo;. You are a high value target as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Politically, Mr. Dorner appears to be a conventional liberal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hillary Clinton. You&rsquo;ll make one hell of a president in 2016. Much like your husband, Bill, you will be one of the greatest. Look at [Mayor Julian] Castro in San Antonio as a running mate or possible secretary of state. He&rsquo;s (good people) and I have faith and confidence in him. Look after Bill. He was always my favorite President. Chelsea grew up to be one hell of an attractive woman. . . .</p>
<p>Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite&rsquo;s lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. . . .</p>
<p>Ellen Degeneres, continue your excellent contribution to entertaining America and bringing the human factor to entertainment. You changed the perception of your gay community and how we as Americans view the LGBT community. I congratulate you on your success and opening my eyes as a young adult, and my generation to the fact that you are know different from us other than who you choose to love. Oh, and you Prop 8 [which banned homosexual marriage in California and was supported by many blacks] supporters, why the fuck do you care who your neighbor marries. Hypocritical pieces of shit.</p>
<p>Westboro Baptist Church [which opposes homosexual], may you all burn slowly in a fire, not from smoke inhalation, but from the flames and only the flames.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dorner resents criticism of Mr. and Mrs. Obama, but says he would have voted for former Utah governor John Huntsman if he had won the Republican primary.</p>
<blockquote><p>You [here Mr. Dorner appears to be addressing whites in general] disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO [Fuck Barrack Hussein Obama] when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents.</p>
<p>You call his wife a Wookie. Off the record, I love your new bangs, Mrs. Obama. A woman whose professional and educational accomplishments are second to none when compared to recent First wives. You call his supporters, whether black, brown, yellow, or white, leeches, FSA, welfare recipients, and ni$&er lovers. You say this openly without any discretion. Before you start with your argument that you believe I would vote for Obama because he has the same skin color as me, fuck you. I didn&rsquo;t vote in this last election as my choice of candidate, John Huntsman, didn&rsquo;t win the primary candidacy for his party.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve done a hell of a job with what you have been dealt and how you have managed it. I shed a tear the night you were initially elected President in 2008. I never thought that day would occur. A black man elected president in the U.S. in my lifetime. I cracked a smiled when you were re-elected in 2012 because I really didn&rsquo;t think you were going to pull that one off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps most ironically, this gun murderer is passionate about gun control:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? . . . Whether by executive order or thru a bi-partisan congress an assault weapons ban needs to be re-instituted. Period!!!</p>
<p>Mia Farrow said it best. &#8220;Gun control is no longer debatable, it&rsquo;s not a conversation, its a moral mandate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Feinstein, you are doing the right thing in leading the re-institution of a national AWB [assault weapons ban]. . . .</p>
<p>Wayne LaPierre, President of the NRA, you&rsquo;re a vile and inhumane piece of shit.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his own, incoherent way, Mr. Dorner is copying Anders Breivik, who explained his 2011 bombing and mass shooting in a lengthy <a href="http://publicintelligence.net/anders-behring-breiviks-complete-manifesto-2083-a-european-declaration-of-independence/">manifesto</a>. Because Mr. Breivik was on the &ldquo;extreme right,&rdquo; the media were fascinated by his statement, wrote about it in detail, and tried to embarrass the people Mr. Breivik admired. They blamed conservatives for creating &ldquo;an atmosphere of hate&rdquo; in which murderous impulses flourished.</p>
<p>We will get no such excitement over Mr. Dorner&rsquo;s statement, because it expresses admiration for liberal causes and liberal media. We can imagine how different things would be if Mr. Dorner were white, admired Patrick Buchanan, was a Second Amendment defender, and a militia member. The media would quote long and lovingly from his statement and throw it in our faces for years. We would hear endlessly about the &ldquo;atmosphere of hate&rdquo; conservatives create simply by breathing.</p>
<p>Mr. Dorner is clearly crazy. However, race and the multi-racial society in which he lives are clearly big parts of his craziness. That is the <i>one clear message</i> from his disorganized ramblings, and the one thing the television reporters he admires will never tell you.</p>
<p>[<em>Editor's note: Many blacks now seem to see Mr. Dorner as a modern-day <a href="http://twitchy.com/2013/02/08/twitter-users-declare-murder-suspect-christopher-dorner-a-modern-day-real-life-django/">Django</a>.</em>]</p>

<p>There was a curious, blaring omission in both the headlines and the stories<br/>
from these supposedly objective outlets, though. Dorner expressed rather<br/>
pointed, explicit views of news personalities and celebrities who have<br/>
influenced, entertained and uplifted him. Dorner praised stars from Ellen<br/>
DeGeneres and Charlie Sheen (&#8220;you&rsquo;re effin awesome&#8221;) to &#8220;Jennifer Beals, Serena<br/>
Williams &hellip; Tamron Hall &hellip; Natalie Portman, Queen Latifah &hellip; Kelly Clarkson,<br/>
Nora Jones, Laura Prepon, Margaret Cho and Rutina Wesley.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shout-outs to liberal journalists go on at length:</p>
<p>&#8220;Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien<br/>
(sic), Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera (sic), Tavis Smiley and Anderson Cooper,<br/>
keep up the great work and follow Cronkite&rsquo;s lead,&#8221; Dorner cheered. &#8220;I hold many<br/>
of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorner also offered an &#8220;atta boy&#8221; to notorious, anti-Second Amendment CNN<br/>
anchor Piers Morgan, suggesting he be given &#8220;an indefinite resident alien and<br/>
Visa card.&#8221;</p>

Nothing is their fault.

<p>Really? And that question wasn&rsquo;t rhetorical. I am not convinced Blacks of various hues in Africa are so consumed about being Black. Is a Masai Mara tribesman or a Zulu tribesman or a Congolese so consumed about being Black? Or is it Blacks in a predominantly White America that are consumed with Blackness ?</p>
<p>I am neither White, nor Black and from what I have seen and known about history, it is possibly White people who are most racially conscious and obsessed with race. Maybe not so much in a liberal-ideology-dominated western world, but historically it seems so. In fact long before I knew anything about the internal Black/White dynamics of the US I used to wonder why were Whites so racially conscious while others weren&rsquo;t as much. That wondering was purely out of curiosity.</p>

We are the least racially conscious group in the U.S. now, after decades of brainwashing. We were once racially conscious because of the presence in great numbers of a vastly diffierent, dangerous and hostile race in our midst. The people wherever you come from probably did not have to deal with such a situation.</p>

<p>This is where the simplicity of racial and ethnic nationalism shines the brightest.<br/>
Each and every distinct racial or ethnic group all share the same desire - to be able to rule themselves and be free from domination by their racial competitors.</p>
<p>This particular fellow is merely the latest example of a social engineering experiment (multi-racial, multi-cultural societies) gone wrong. </p>
<p>You see, these kinds of societies have never - not once in the entirety of documented world history - ever been successful. The reasons are sometimes complex, but can always be boiled down to racial and ethnic conflict and competition for power and limited resources. Such societies always have to have a &#8216;Pecking Order&rsquo; and the question becomes: Who Pecks Whom?</p>
<p>This guy didn&rsquo;t like his position in the pecking order, and for that, a race realist cannot blame him. Nobody likes being pecked, right?</p>
<p>But then we have starry eyed liberals who are like little children and who stubbornly refuse to let go of their fantasized Utopian Dream of defying the laws of nature and forcing their multi-cultural, multi-racial nightmare of a world down upon millions of incompatible people against their will.</p>

Most American don&rsquo;t understand that the Kansas-Missouri war started a few years before Lincoln became president. Even if someone else had won that 1860 election, the Civil War most likely would have happened anyway. Worse yet, as you say, will be a far more terrible race-based war because our elites were too terrified to stand up to black tyrants.</p>

<p> Have had this talk at least three times, and every time has the same ending. Blacks all stop and go into complete shock. They cannot fathom that we do not think about black people 24/7.

Some openly avoid eating chicken in public, others have a completely different persona around races.</p>

<p>Exhibit A for the prosecution: Obama</p>
<p>Exhibit B for the prosecution: Tim Wise</p>
<p>Exhibit C for the prosecution: Jon Stewart</p>
<p>Exhibit D for the prosecution: Eric Holder</p>
<p>If I had the time, I could probably think of half a dozen or so more names. The point, though, is that it seems as if these mixed race individuals are consumed with some sort of deep rooted bitterness, as if their incompatible genes are waging an internal war against one another. Interestingly, the white genes are never the victors in these gene wars, and these products of miscegenation will always have an elevated sense of hatred for Whites who are 100 percent White. </p>
<p>A message to White females: Please be loyal to your race and do not allow the media to program you to race mix and create any more of these kinds of tinder boxes.</p>

Overall, it is a small percentage of whites who do this, but if we are going to take this issue seriously, and make a huge production out of it, let&rsquo;s start telling the whole truth instead of taking the easy way out and always blaming the weaker gender. Real men take responsibility for their race instead of hiding behind the skirts of their women. This seems to be a common occurence in this movement, and women like me get turned off by it. I am barely out of my twenties, and my white boyfriend isn&rsquo;t nearly as racially conscious as I am, but I prefer men like him over a lot of what I see on this website.</p>

I make no excuses for them and disapprove of their lack of self control and sexual restraint, as well as their lack of concern for the pitiful example they set as a result of their behavior.</p>
<p>However, Mother Nature saw fit to equip females and only females (Billy Crystal excepted) with wombs and the precious and sacred ability to give birth to White babies. So, whether it seems fair or not - it is far more critical that White females honor their race, because they carry the sacred honor of determining whether or not White European people survive. </p>
<p>After all, females have 100 percent control over the selection issue. They determine who gets a date, whether that suitor will get a second date or not, and whether that suitor will share their bed and even how often that treat is awarded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one to make excuses for men who act like dogs and seem to be willing to hump anything that offers them access, but White females who find a good White man need to remember that staking their claim can be a tremendous help in the process of forming a bond with the man and seldom will a happy and contented man be prone to straying.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199191" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I would venture to submit that in today&rsquo;s world, after the last 50 or so years of Cultural Marxist promoted feminist brainwashing, that it would be almost impossible to find any White female who has not been contaminated to some degree by this racially suicidal ideology. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read and been a fan of Courtney&rsquo;s comments over the past few years, and I believe that she has her head screwed on right, for the most part, and her admirable views on the racial issue are deserving of our highest praise and respect. </p>
<p>As for your assertion that it is far worse for White racial prestige for our women to climb down the evolutionary totem pole and allow themselves to be bred by blacks or other non-white races, I would tend to almost agree with this principle. Clearly, throughout world history - Aryan, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Germanic peoples have always placed our females at a higher and more honored and respected position in our societies than have any other race of people. Perhaps this is because they are the most beautiful, precious and desirable females on Earth. Chivalry did not originate in the Congo. However, with the arrival of the feminism sickness came all of the obnoxious, repulsive, gonad-busting, unfeminine, anti-male hostility, coarseness, vulgarity and </p>
<p>impossible-to-please attitudes and this has served to drive many White men away from the institution of marriage. Oh, and combine all these truly unpleasant characteristics with the narcissism that far too many attractive White females allow themselves to develop when they realize that they are #1 on the list of desirability - and we are definitely talking about women who can become truly insufferable to be around, due to their bloated egos. </p>
<p>However, where I have a problem with your assertion is when I contemplate how repugnant it is for me to consider hooking up with a White female who has bedded with blacks or other non-whites in her past. Why should it not be equally repugnant for a White female to hook up with a White guy who&rsquo;s done likewise?</p>
<p>I think the racial loyalty that we demand from our ladies is something that they deserve to demand from their men.</p>
<p>Courtney&rsquo;s opinion is welcomed.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199239" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for defending me Tucker. I have disagreed with you a couple of times under this article for two entirely different reasons but it wasn&rsquo;t because I was targeting you. It wasn&rsquo;t until I went back to look at my comments that I realized that it was you I disagreed with both times. Sorry about that. And I agree with your original response above.</p>
<p>As for the poster who&rsquo;s comment got deleted, I was able to read what it originally said since I get email notifications. Any man in this movement who calls me a feminist couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. How many times in the past have I come on here supporting white men and denouncing feminism? Plus, I mentioned that I love my white boyfriend so how in the world am I a feminist?</p>
<p>When men in this movement resort to labeling me as a feminist, which doesn&rsquo;t happen very often, it is because they are miserable people who have their own issues to sort out. They expect white women to be doormats like Asian women even though white women have never been like that at all in history. I agree that feminism is bad and that the way white women behaved before the 1950s is healthier, but even during those times, it is not as if white men treated white women like animals who are never allowed to voice an opinion.</p>
<p>Thank goodness his comment got deleted. His post consisted more of a knee jerk attack as opposed to factual criticism of me. Men like him expect white women to be perfect in every way while not placing the same expectations on his own gender. Any man who objects to my issue with that must be weak indeed. My white boyfriend isn&rsquo;t perfect but I still like him for who he is. If we want our race to continue procreating then perhaps some men on here need to stop setting their expectations so high.</p>

<p>White culture has been so thoroughly debased by Marxist Feminism, it is very nearly impossible to find a satisfactory woman.</p>
<p>You wrote: &#8220;I think the racial loyalty that we demand from our ladies is something that they deserve to demand from their men.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a white man fornicates with a non-white woman, that is no problem to most women. However, if a white woman fornicates with a non-white man (or any man, actually), I have no interest in pursuing her. </p>
<p>Women are the vessels, and as such they are defiled by fornication, while men are more or less impervious to defilement by women. </p>
<p>(This is about social defilement, spiritual defilement, virtue, honor and prestige. STDs are a separate but related topic. Regarding biological defilement, the correlation backs up the social rules on defilement.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the lack of racial integrity is the symptom and Feminism is the disease. Any woman who demands &#8220;equality&#8221; with men (especially regarding expectations of sexual morality) is pulling in the wrong direction, not a team player.</p>

Perhaps Courtney can&rsquo;t help showing some &#8220;I am woman hear me roar&#8221; mannerisms since she&rsquo;s been force -fed them her entire life. I despise feminism as much as the next self-respecting man but I do think she has a valid point about white women having a strong role in European societies, particularly the Celtic and Teutonic cultures. At the end of the day man and woman each have to accept their natural role in the relationship without trying to run roughshod over each other. This is the essence of true partnership. However, the Cultural Marxists (and we all know who THEY are don&rsquo;t we?)have taken white womanhood&rsquo;s natural strengths and tricked them into turning against their own men. What better way to destroy our race than by turning us against one another.?</p>

I was simply trying to acknowledge the tradition of strong white womanhood that you seem to represent while at the same time acknowledging the corrosive influence of feminism and its hijacking of strong white women. BTW I particularly liked your &#8220;doormat&#8221; reference .You also make a valid point about writing versus actually speaking. It can be confusing when people perceive a certain tone in a statement that was unintended by the writer. I think many women have unconsciously absorbed feminist influences through societal pressure.. A perfect example of this is the comment below from Daisy who says you are &#8220;sad&#8221; because you &#8220;crave validation from neanderthal males&#8221;. I realize that it was meant to be humorous but it illustrates my point: She&rsquo;s cutting you up for simply defending yourself and dismissing the rest of us as stupid retrograde cavemen. In any event, I enjoy the commentary from both of you ladies. Stay White!</p>

It is beyond sad that as a culture or movement too many white men require submissiveness in women to feel whole. Luckily enough plenty are not like that and as a woman just settling in to middle age I wanted to remind Courtney of that. I feel that the pro-white movement is hijacking the tribal traditions of strong white men frankly. And for the record I was born un-submissive; it&rsquo;s in my celtic germanic DNA and there&rsquo;s nothing - no societal pressure from any angle or ism - that can change it</p>

However, after spending a lot of time on this website, it is very hard not to sometimes sound like feminists in our posts when we rightfully disagree with some of the uncalled for slants against white women on here. </p>
<p>The way I get treated sometimes on here makes me wonder why I bother at all. Do you feel the same way? I spend 90% of my time sticking up for white men on here but it is never good enough. Some of these guys ( not most), for whatever reason, only zero in on the times I call men out when I feel white women are being unfairly ridiculed. If that makes me feminist, then I agree with you Daisy, that this movement has no future. </p>
<p>There is a minority of men on here who have bad luck finding life partners, so they take it out on white women, sometimes even serenading the rest of us about how Asian women are better. They are only a minority but they bark louder than the rest of the men on here and tend to run the show in the comments sections of these websites. If any woman dare call them out for it, we get called feminists. You are right that I shouldn&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>

To the women on this thread, my wife is older and more racist than I am, truly not to be f-ed with. Her beauty, strength of character and intellect are undeniable, but racial loyalty is the precondition for liberating these traits, which are otherwise bastardized by feminism and egalitarianism, two ideologies that were once hostile to each other in the West.<br/>

The vast majority of whites in America would find this whole sub-thread worthy of ridicule and derision and I have news for folks: you&rsquo;re going nowhere with these attitudes. White America isn&rsquo;t changing for you. Women are not giving up their jobs, nor are their husbands eschewing the money and benefits their wives earn for their families. To have any chance of surviving, pro-whites will have to change their tune with regard to gender. Not because I want them to, but because no significant percentage of whites will listen to a darn word sexist pro-whites say.</p>

What I do have a problem with is the constant one sided gender blame game that goes on on here, as if white women are the source of everything wrong with our race. From a factual standpoint, considering that we recognize gender differences, that viewpoint isn&rsquo;t even rational. </p>
<p>I think you make a good point about women working. White women get accused of being feminists on here because we work. I don&rsquo;t think that accusation is fair, considering that most of us work right now because financially we have to, considering how whites are over taxed these days. In other words, white men on here are rightfully angry, but directing their anger at white women gets us no where, and most of the time it is misinformed. They need to be directing their anger at our leaders.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-200541" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Personally, I had never been obsessed with the idea that I had to find a virgin or else I would never consider a woman as marriage material. Having this attitude was probably a good thing, since by the time I began my most serious relationship pursuing years, virginity had become almost as rare as finding four leaf clovers and in today&rsquo;s times, a guy would have to be wiling to pursue girls who were young enough to risk getting himself busted for statutory rape with an under age minor. Only a fool would want to take on risks of this nature.</p>
<p>In a practical sense, it is probably better that the man have more experience in the area of sex than a woman, but that does not mean that a woman shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a little experience under her belt, as well. The deal breaker is whether the female is able to limit herself to a reasonable number of discreet intimate encounters prior to finding Mr. Right, so as to not have earned a tawdry reputation that would tarnish her as having slept with two or three dozen men in town. i know of no White man who has even an ounce of pride who would be comfortable with the idea that his girlfriend or wife had once been the town slut. </p>
<p>Perhaps other men on Amren will know what I&rsquo;m saying. There is a huge difference in how a woman makes us feel about them, when they offer themselves to us and tell us that they are doing so because we are special and that they truly do care for us, and because they&rsquo;ve tried to ensure that they have a good reputation - we can take them at their word. </p>
<p>In other words, if women tell us we are special, we want it to be true - and not just the same old line that they&rsquo;ve told dozens of other guys.</p>

<p>Biologically, males will suspect a woman of infidelity when a child is born, particularly one who has demonstrated promiscuity in the past. He does not want to waste ANY resources on offspring which do not transmit his DNA. Cuckoldry is a very contentious and *lethal* matter among higher sexual species where the male cannot be certain of the paternity of the offspring. Many/most male animals will immediately kill the offspring of a competing<br/>
male. Sometimes the drive is so vigorous they will even kill their own<br/>
as potential sexual competitors. The female *knows* which child carries her DNA but the male cannot be certain. It is a lopsided system. Every child is necessarily &#8220;blood kin&#8221; of the female but not so for the male. Even in a modern society of genetic testing, primitive motives can be a big player in social interactions. </p>
<p>It may not be &#8220;fair&#8221; but evolution is not fair and we are the product of 200,000+ years of human evolution. Fortunately, I believe that we can do better than animals -most of us anyway.</p>

At this point I could really care less as to whether or not you think my boyfriend is real. I could also care less about your view that I am a feminist. Why should I allow you to be the judge of that considering you are single? And yes, I will be attending the Amren conference in April like I usually do.</p>

If we are only discussing mixing with blacks then I agree that white women do it more. That aside, how is race mixing counterproductive when stats show that only a tiny percentage of whites do it? I don&rsquo;t like it when I see it but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it is constructive to make negative generalizations about white women when most of us aren&rsquo;t doing it.

I am saying that miscegination is generally counterproductive, especially for whites in our current situation, Of all the races i would want to interbreed with if forced to, blacks would be at the bottom of the list. No man in my family has bred with, or considered breeding with a black, But two women in my extended family (nieces) have bred with blacks, with the typical results-abuse and abandonment. Those nieces are now completely ostracized. I don&rsquo;t think the percentage of white females breeding with blacks is tiny, but whatever it is, it has been visibly increasing over the last several decades to the point where it is not perceived as unusual, and to me, that is quite too much. The media have been on a blitz for the last thirty years in movies, TV, books and magazine stories and advertising to push the white female towards the black male. We see the results all around us, and they are not good for the white race in general, or for the maintenance of traditional American values.</p>

The things we see that make us angry tend to get inflated in our heads. So far, I haven&rsquo;t seen any men posting statistics proving that white men intermarry any less than white women when looking at actual intermarriage stats with ALL nonwhites. All I am seeing are emotional outbursts based on first hand observations. I already know I am right on this. Look up the statistics for yourselves. They are all over the internet to the point where I don&rsquo;t even need to post them here. But I will if someone asks. Forgive me. I really don&rsquo;t care for negative generalizations about white women based on the fact that some of you go out running errands, and out of 100 white women who have white children, you focus on the two who don&rsquo;t.</p>

It has a wonderful opening line: &#8220;The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as best I could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge&#8221;. The person goes on to kill Fortunato by chaining him up and building a brick wall around him in. All over an alleged insult.</p>
<p>That story reminds me of this guy. Someone calls him a name in first grade and his response is a swift kick and a punch. He is left to ponder how on earth he deserves any punishment when in reality his response was 10 times worse then what the name caller did. Usually kids grow up and realize about right and wrong, fair and unfair, reasonable and unreasonable reactions. He hasn&rsquo;t. He is a deranged racial bully who never grew up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a liberal through and through. He thinks that because he has a vocabulary one shade beyond ebonics, that should be sufficient proof that he is intelligent, articulate and therefore a truthful victim.. The problem here, is that while his white DNA has elevated his IQ 2 points, his jungle DNA and liberal indoctrination have created a narcissistic psychopath who has been taught that even alleged or imagined insults or injustices are perfect justification for a murderous rampage..</p>

<p>http://boywithgrenade.org/2013/02/07/christopher-dorners-manifesto/</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but read this Omar Thornton lookalike&rsquo;s manifesto in its near entirety, as each new sentence seemed to be a perfect affirmation of the Auster Law of Negro ineptitude, namely: toxic levels of self esteem combined with innate cognitive deficiencies. </p>
<p>Read it yourself you&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;m talking about. </p>
<p>You can tell that this black murderer has a slightly above average IQ for his demographic, but nevertheless the overall stupidity seems to just leap off the page as he makes typically negro poor word choices such as &#8220;severing a blue line&#8221; (as opposed to the more logical &#8220;crossing the blue line&#8221;). </p>
<p>And talk about self confidence! This black ex-cop, who boasts about his childhood school years when he rarely frequented other blacks, clearly has &#8220;toxic levels&#8221; of it. Just imagine how much self confidence you would have to possess to churn out TWENTY pages of this stuff! But the poor creature is too stupid to understand that it is stupid. </p>
<p>In a way this manifesto is very reminiscent of the crazy black lady who wrote &#8220;Curtis Was Slapped By A White Teacher&#8221; (http://www.alternativeright.com/main/blogs/zeitgeist/curtis-got-slapped-by-a-white-teacher/#disqus_thread). </p>

<p>I hope they catch the guy quick. </p>

I am enjoying the idea that a product of the corrupt process that deliberately seeks out people who have dangerous psychopathic personality disorders and then puts these kinds of monsters into police uniforms, gives them badges and dangerous weapons and then sends them out to terrorize grannies in wheel-chairs is now making the Dr. Frankensteins in the LAPD sweat a little bit, wondering which one of their other more polished psychopaths might be next on his grievance settlement list.</p>
<p>This would make a great horror movie plot. Maybe Jaime Foxx could take the role of this black cop-gone-bad and we could be treated to a preview trailer where he says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Killing White Cops for no pay? What&rsquo;s not to like about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a false comparison. Breivik murdered political targets that were opposed to his right wing beliefs. Dorner has expressed some liberal values which are totally disconnected from his personal vendetta against the police force. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-198814" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This trend towards making the &#8216;n-word&rsquo; a crime worse than mass murder really dates back to when Clinton was in office. Oh, and it only applies to Whites using the word, not blacks. That was also about the same time Hollywood launched their propaganda campaign which I dubbed &#8220;Operation Let&rsquo;s Glorify Black Males and Turn them into Objects of Worship&#8221;. </p>
<p>Starting with the movie &rsquo;48 Hours&rsquo;, Hollywood started cranking out non-stop &#8216;buddy&rsquo; movies where every major White male box office star had to be paired up with a black &#8216;buddy&rsquo;. Gradually, the White male Alpha male was demoted to the clumsy sidekick position and the black male was the Alpha stud and, naturally, he was the guy who got to bed the pretty White female actress costar instead of the White sidekick loser.</p>
<p>I remember this &#8216;n-word&rsquo; was commonly used in many Hollywood movies prior to the 1990s, by White actors and not necessarily in a context that was meant to disparage White Southerners. In my view, its a whole lot less offensive than hearing the &#8216;F-word&rsquo; blasting out of the mouths of every white female actress.</p>
<p>Anyway, this amazing growth of thin skin among blacks about being called the n-word tends to correspond to those Clinton years and I think Hollywood deliberately brainwashed them into believing that being called this name justified them murdering whoever did so. </p>
<p>We are dealing with a dangerously primitive mindset here, as well as with a race of people who are already prone towards spontaneous, undisciplined outbursts of random violence. A very deadly combination.</p>

I noted also that what he has to say isn&rsquo;t quite as crazy and ludicrous as what Louis Farrakhan often rants about.<br/>
And the kind of thoughts he has comes from the black rank and file, too, not just the elites. They agree that the government blew up the levees in N.O. to kill them all off, and introduced drugs and aids into their neighborhoods to do the same thing; a large portion of them think Devil&rsquo;s Food Cake is a racist name and a &#8220;black hole in space&#8221; is a racist term.<br/>
The black FCC Czar, Mark Lloyd, believes it would only be fair if whites whould step down from their positioins and allow &#8220;people of color&#8221; and homosexuals to step in (Of course by &#8220;people of color&#8221; he means blacks).<br/>
I could go on and on and on with examples of bizaar beliefs by blacks that are even nuttier than what the above black murderer rants about, but it would take several pages.<br/>
I&rsquo;m slowly arriving at a creeping realization that the vast majority of the black population are just as screwy as this guy. And I&rsquo;m absolutely serious.<br/>
He appears to me to be about the black norm&hellip;.or really, really close to it&hellip;..and I seriously don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s an exaggeration.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-198830" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You are 100 percent correct, Daisy. In the old days, candidates who were applying for positions as a police officer were given fairly extensive examinations which were designed to determine whether the candidate had the potential for, or if they had latent personality disorders, which might manifest themselves in psychopathic behaviors after they were in uniform and on the job. These kinds of individuals were deemed to be undesirable and not suited for jobs as police officers and were weeded out.</p>
<p>However, today - I am 100 percent convinced that this paradigm has now been deliberately shifted, i.e., reversed 180 degrees and now these tests are being used to find and recruit the people who do show psychopathic characteristics. This is a direct reflection of the fact that our nation has been hijacked by politicians who are themselves, the biggest collection of psychopaths and sociopaths ever assembled at the top of any first world government in the history of the world. These hostile ruling elites are literally consumed with hatred for the people they rule over, and they also fear us, because we vastly outnumber them and Americans are most well armed people on Earth. </p>
<p>For anyone who doubts my theory, simply spend a few hours each week on youtube and you can watch hours and hours of videos that come from every geographic location in our country - whereby thugs with badges are beating the snot out of the citizens who pay their salaries for the most trivial of reasons. Or, using these sadistic torture devices called &#8216;tasers&rsquo; on citizens for the flimsiest of reasons. Or, see the videos of 5 or 10 cops on top of a guy on the ground - fighting with each other for an opportunity to land a club or a fist on a guy who&rsquo;s already half unconscious. </p>
<p>Psychopaths with badges, folks. Cops are not our friends.</p>
<p>And, what makes me the most nauseated - is that the vast majority of these psychos are White males. </p>
<p>Makes me ashamed of my race.</p>

<p>When Camden, NJ laid off half of its police force due to budget cuts, locals quipped that crime would drop as a result, because the cops were the city&rsquo;s biggest criminal element.

Although New Orleans is much smaller than say, LA or NYC, remember how virtually the entire NOPD walked off the job during Katrina?

The NYPD allowing (on orders from a black mayor) three days of negro rioting so they could &#8220;get it out of their system&#8221;???

This is all a play for the public benefit. Does it not seem strange that BOTH parties always endorse a central &#8220;independent&#8221; bank, both endorse &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; &#8220;civil rights&#8221; spying, federalization of all law-enforcement, education dicta, foreign aid, wars of aggression, you name it. The differences are almost all cosmetic. Call them &#8220;fellow travelers&#8221; rather than &#8220;conspirators&#8221; if you like but at the top, they all agree on the major points -power and wealth for them, and not you. The &#8220;people of color&#8221; are all just too stupid to figure out who is actually turning the knobs. They are so focused on &#8220;gibsme&#8221; that they don&rsquo;t care what happens in five years.</p>
<p>Also, maybe while doing all of that &#8220;respecting&#8221; of white officers you haven&rsquo;t noticed the very significant darkening of gov&rsquo;t employees of every sort, particularly cops. Look at the military -the employer of last resort now for America. All of those people will get hiring preferences among the &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; agencies because they have a proven history of violence. &#8220;Continuity of Government&#8221; plans and bunkers for themselves built in the mountains/underground, 1.5 billion *more* rounds of .223 and .40 JHP ammo for the federal gov&rsquo;t while trying their damnedest to ban same for you. Assign benign motives if you wish but don&rsquo;t scoff at people who have seen the megalomania of similar intelligent sociopaths in the past and anticipate a repeat. You are as naive as the blacks who think that His Hopefulness has their interests at heart because he approximates their complexion.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-216092" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Courtney: This is a late reply to your question and you may never see it. But, have you ever wondered why so many of these thug cop assault videos are being uploaded to Youtube? Also, who is doing the uploading and could they possibly have an ulterior motive for doing so?</p>
<p>Apparently, judging from your comments, you have not spent any appreciable time at Youtube watching these videos - but, I assure you, they are real and they are NOT a &#8216;conspiracy theory&rsquo;. And, as I said earlier - the vast and overwhelming majority of these sadistic psychopaths with badges and tasers and clubs are White men. This is fact, not theory.</p>
<p>So, if I may offer a possible answer to my own question: Could these videos wind up on Youtube because whoever is doing the uploading of them - wants to show millions of people who it is who is engaging in most of this brutality? In order to arouse, within the hearts and brains of the viewers, an increase in the level of hatred and for a desire for retribution? It has occurred to me that this could be part of Cultural Marxist enemy&rsquo;s demonization campaign which has been directed at the White male with increasingly obvious focus with each passing year. </p>
<p>if this theory is correct, or even partly correct, then White males who engage in this behavior are stupidly playing into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. By their actions, they are substantiating our enemy&rsquo;s demonization of White men. Not only among minorities - who already harbor deep rooted resentment and hatreds for Whites, but it also serves to rattle and shape the attitudes of White men and women who observe this kind of thuggish behavior. </p>
<p>Personally, I do not experience any sense of racial pride when I see members of my race acting like sadistic animals - and, I have a particularly strong streak within me that opposes authority figures who abuse the authority that their position bestows upon them. You asked earlier whether or not I was &#8216;on the side of Whites&rsquo; and the answer to that question is a conditional yes. </p>
<p>The conditional part is dependent upon the individual White man or woman&rsquo;s behavior and conduct, and willingness to engage in civilized behavior.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199416" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8221; This is a direct reflection of the fact that our nation has been<br/>
hijacked by politicians who are themselves, the biggest collection of<br/>
psychopaths and sociopaths ever assembled at the top of any first world<br/>
government in the history of the world. These hostile ruling elites are<br/>
literally consumed with hatred for the people they rule over, and they<br/>
also fear us, because we vastly outnumber them and Americans are most<br/>
well armed people on Earth&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you know Kissinger and his ilk think us &#8220;useless eaters&#8221;. I believe these few whites are the *central* reason that we now suffer this destruction and it will get worse. The &#8220;gentry-class&#8221; of whites must be disarmed and destroyed. We could manage individual random criminals even in the numbers we have now but having sociopathic enablers from the top on down promoting and protecting violent lackeys, particularly of other races cannot be withstood by a disorganized white population. Sometimes, as in this case, their stooges get so bad that the behavior can&rsquo;t be hidden from public discovery so it is passed off as &#8220;&hellip;an unexplained and rare event in a long and distinguished career of public service by the department&#8221; or whatever.</p>
<p>These are intentionally dangerous people operated remote control by our owners. Some get out of transmitter range and this is what happens.</p>

<p>If this serial killer Chris Dorner was a White man, he would be labeled as a crazy extremist Tea Party Cracka by Blacks and self hating White liberals. But since he is Black, he is seen as the second coming of Martin Luther King Jr., sent to earth to fight the evils of &#8220;racism&#8221; perpetrated by &#8220;White supremacists&#8221; who hold the Black man down.</p>

<p>My opinion on women in combat MOS&rsquo;, Designators, Rates, and AFSC&rsquo;s. I wish all of you who attempt to pursue combat occupational roles the greatest success in completing, graduating, and qualifying in their respective schools/courses. Many want to see you fail. Remember, everyone of you is a pioneer. There was a time when they didn&rsquo;t allow blacks to fight the good fight. This is your civil rights. Don&rsquo;t quit!!!</p>

<p> He&rsquo;s already a hero of the left and they&rsquo;ll be happy to support him as he spills his guts in a plea deal, as Rafael Perez did in the infamous LAPD Rampart Scandal.

They learn to point and shoot people, and it makes them oh so powerful. Why you minorities are at it why don&rsquo;t you squelch all the violence in rap music and quit promoting the thug lifestyle. It is not popular in suburban white communities. You posion your own, then blame us. From my position it would appear that there are far more gun crazy youths thinking about killing thier cousins and etc because of a colored rag or hat. We shot at people also, Our color was Olive drab and we had the best weapons in the world. War was over, we stopped shooting.. Want to play with guns and see some real s*it, join the Army</p>

<p>Nuance your words, and I agree with you. The weapons per se are legal, but the way they are being possessed by the actors who possess them are illegal. So while most adults can possess a typical pistol, the kind of people possessing them aren&rsquo;t allowed to. So in that case, the illegality isn&rsquo;t the object, it&rsquo;s the person.</p>

I admit to making &#8216;liberal&rsquo; use of the finnish equivalent of the N-word and I think it&rsquo;s right. Indians of India tend to be darker (hence more &#8220;black&#8221;) than this guy or Obama but I think N-word blacks would get mad if we started calling everyone with a dark skin with the gutless PC term of &#8220;black&#8221; as it would do away with their sense of uniqueness and some of the privilege. Liberals and blacks know that race is more than skin colour the moment they get annoyed about us pointing that out. I was fined ten times the money most people can expect to get as compensation over a beating for merely hinting that I dislike non-whites and the scummy prosecutor jumped at the chance to claim that I hate &#8220;skin colour&#8221; (because white nationalists in Hollywood movies are like that and there is no difference in the education of a 13 year old boy watching these films and that of a middle-aged slob with law credentials) but of course he would not have had a problem if he suspected that I was talking about tanned white people.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a whole lot of unnecessary invective and paranoia out there at the moment about this issue. And the whole thing is only possible because the word &#8220;citizen&#8221; has been drastically weakened.</p>
<p>Are you outraged that the American government is using armed drones to kill American citizens?</p>
<p>Check out the names of these &ldquo;citizens,&rdquo; and what they&rsquo;re doing and where they&rsquo;re doing it. I&rsquo;ll give you a hint: The citizen isn&rsquo;t named Tom Smith who looks like I did when I was 16 and whose &ldquo;crime&rdquo; was running a stop sign at the corner of Oak and Main in Anytown, USA. The &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; is named something like Mohammed al-Terroristiqua, whose parents immigrated to America from Whackistan, and who eventually felt his genetic urge and imperative and ran back to Whackistan at the age of 17 to join an AQ affiliate to learn how to fight and kill (real) Americans.</p>
<p>The American government will give citizenship to anyone with a pulse these days, as long as he or she is not white.</p>
<p>That said, any domestic drone use should be unarmed only and information gathering only. If need be, the Federal and state constitutions should be amended as such. So far, any discussion of domestic drone use has been just that   &mdash;   Unarmed, and observational only.</p>
<p>However, the same government that would pull off Waco and Ruby Ridge would probably eventually resort to armed drone usage domestically. Just not tomorrow.</p>

I caution American Renaissance readers to be on guard against race denying paranoid conspiracy obsessed Kranks that are always lurking around White racial realist groups. The case you mentions of supposedly an American citizen killed by a US drone attack was done in Yemen to an extremely ugly Afro/Arab Muslim terrorist leader, hardly a regular White American. Under the treasonous, insane policy of &#8220;birth right citizenship&#8221; this completely alien non White Muslimwas given UScitizenship because his ugly, hateful Muslim parents pooped out this little monster in Arizona wheretheyweresomehowallowedto attend US colleges.</p>
<p>Crappy colleges in places like Arizona, Teenesse are filed with ugly Arabs, Black Africans who use the student visas to gate crash a White country.</p>
<p>Then we get confused, race denying &#8220;patriots&#8221; like Ron Paul accepting these Muslim terrorists in Yemen as full fledged American citizens and spading paranoia that regular (White) Americans are about to attacked by drones shooting missiles.</p>

And if I dare mention the discrimination I and many like myself have endured to watch low I.Q, rude, obnoxious, unqualified, functionally illiterate and violent blacks get hired and promoted over well qualified Whites all in the name of diversity. Yeah, I guess I am angry but I am a civilized, law abiding citizen so I don&rsquo;t think I will be stalking and killing blacks any time in the near future just because I was called a few names. Furthermore, blacks are not civil and thus, they should have no civil rights. I think the southern Whites knew what they were doing with Jim Crow laws.</p>

<p>His worldview is typical of most blacks in that he sees he and his fellow black brethren as the most open minded, peace loving, non-racist and courteous people who are struggling mightily against the evil, no good and incorrigibly racist and genocidal white race. His jeremiad against the alleged bigotry of all races and homosexuals in the LAPD may just be cover so he can&rsquo;t be accused of being a black supremacist and to confound investigators.

For once, it is refreshing to see &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; and &#8220;government&#8221; types &#8220;squirm&#8221; when &#8220;one of their own&#8221; turns on them.</p>

These are the same types of posters who will refer to white males like George Bush and Romney as &#8220;idiots&#8221;, but then in the same sentence refer to Obama as a brainiac. They also remind us about how we shouldn&rsquo;t put down Asian immigrants who are &#8220;smarter&#8221; than most lower class whites, or how we shouldn&rsquo;t make fun of Indian Hindus, or arab Muslims since some of them contribute to society, and how their women aren&rsquo;t sluts like white women. I guess this unhealthy and irrational, &#8220;humble&#8221;, self hatred disease, that seems to only be exhibited by whites, is something that I can&rsquo;t even escape from on this website. I am sick of it.</p>

GWB wasn&rsquo;t exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, and although I wouldn&rsquo;t call Obama a &#8220;brainiac&#8221;, he isn&rsquo;t any worse than his predecessor in that regard. As far as Asians go, I consider East Asians to be on par with, and probably slightly better, than Eastern Europeans. They deserve respect and I think WW2 Germany made them an exception for a reason. Lastly. the guys who call white women slutty are most likely referring to those who date blacks.</p>

Obviously, you aren&rsquo;t understanding how a lot of whites such as myself could care less at this point about hearing the constant virtues of other races, no matter how true SOME, only some, of them are. You missed my point about George Bush. The media constantly finds the liberty to label white male politicians as idiots while black rappers get called geniuses. Forgive me for not wishing to go along with it. </p>
<p>And please elaborate what you mean when you say East Asians are slightly better than Eastern Europeans. How? In what way? If you are comparing scientific achievements and mathematical geniuses then I would have to disagree with you. In regards to my comment about white women, again you have missed my point. Why is it healthy to constantly make sweeping negative generalizations about white women when, as you acknowledge yourself, the posters on here who are guilty of this are only refering to a certain subset of that demographic?</p>

They are both from the Republican party and decisions they make (or made) affect the entire country, so any criticism against them is going to be necessarily magnified. Their policies are one thing, but it didn&rsquo;t help them at all that the former was out of touch with the common man, and the latter just wasn&rsquo;t smart. It&rsquo;s far easier for the media to praise those &#8220;black rappers&#8221; because all they need to do is focus on their music, entertainment etc.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with East Asians. Their societies, especially Japan and China, are far more dynamic today than those of Romania, Ukraine, Belarus etc. They have a spirit and sense of optimism over there that&rsquo;s hard to find these days. I can understand why people think they&rsquo;re the future. I&rsquo;m not sure why you&rsquo;re so focused exclusively on scientific achievements; the general public certainly isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Guys who make &#8220;sweeping negative generalizations&#8221; about white women are referring to those who date blacks, but in the heat of the moment they aren&rsquo;t going to make the distinction between those who do and don&rsquo;t. They are the same guys who also get annoyed when they see an Asian man dating a White woman, yet somehow didn&rsquo;t notice the 9 white men who are going out with Asian women that just walked by. Don&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199067" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I accept your responses on the George Bush as well as the white female issue, and agree. However, the answer you gave me as to why East Asians are better than Eastern Europeans seems more a matter of opinion rather than fact. Comparing scientific achievements seems more tangible and logical than simply stating &#8220;the general public likes the optimism of East Asia and therefore they are the future super powers&#8221;. </p>
<p>Plus, you opened up your statement saying &#8220;there is nothing wrong with East Asians&#8221; when I never said there was, as long as they stay in their own societies. That comment doesn&rsquo;t address my point since that wasn&rsquo;t even what I was saying in the first place. Also, you list a few Eastern European countries, only comparing them to a couple of Asian countries.</p>
<p>I am not picking on you, but your comments on how East Asians are better than Eastern Europeans are a fine example of the types of comments I was criticizing in my original post, that I see far too often on this website. Again, whites get denigrated enough by the media based on false, emotional, claims, while other races are given praises and attributes that they haven&rsquo;t earned. So when I see comments like that on this website of all places, I would at least like to see good explanations.</p>

<p>This is about a War on Whites and the elimination of the White race. The facts speak for themselves as Europe, Australia, Canada, the US are flooded with non-Whites of the Third World and Asians are given visas to replace White engineers and programmers. Anyone who deigns to complain is axiomatically and instantly labeled a Nazi.</p>
<p>Yet some on this forum and others blame White women for the demise of the White race.</p>
<p>Unbelievable!! We (you and I and a few others) have been called every name for female dog and worse right here of all places - then I read that no White movement will succeed without White women.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-199153" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The interracial cohabitation/marriage rates of Asian females in Southern California are of epidemic proportions. I believe the IR cohabitation rates for Asian females are at 60% or close to it while their IR marriage rates are near the 40% range. The majority of Asian men probably grew up being bullied by black/hispanic/white kids only to see 6/10 Asian females cohabitating with non-Asian men later in life. Human beings are indeed animals after all. I&rsquo;m sure thousands upon thousands of Asian men and Black women in California and across the country were satisfied somewhere in the back of their minds that an interracial couple involving an Asian woman and Black man was liquidated. I see the situation in its entirety something like this: Muslim men hopelessly lash out against the White man&rsquo;s encroachment and globalism with fundamentalism and terrorism. Asian men lash out against the White man in general by sensibly competing with him on the global stage. Black men seem to lash out against the White man hopelessly in all of their hopeless glory in whatever they do in life whether it is through race mixing or creating music videos with bling and hoes. Mr. Dorner is intelligent no doubt but not top tier obviously. A lone strong man with a cause in mind cannot do much by himself unless he is backed by a large constituency that he has managed to dupe according to his spoken words/philosophy/lies.</p>

As all whites know, if you have any kind of disagreement with a black, violence can happen. We are all on guard if a black is in any kind of disagreement. </p>
<p>Just look at this black guys rantings. If someone says some word he doesn&rsquo;t approve of, get violent. Right from early school, this guy showed the black tendency to get violent . The stereotype is true. Blacks have the mentality that violence is a proper response for a verbal disagreement.<br/>
And how many other acts of violence has this black guy done that he is not mentioning? He clearly gets violent since the black brain is inclined to violence.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think he is sane, has an ax to grind against opponents of his worldview. I would like to see a showdown between him and his kind and some of the police feminists/lesbians he rails against, however. I&rsquo;d pay good money for that and bring lots of popcorn.</p>
<p>Dorner is a rational murderer who thinks punishment for racism should be death.</p>
<p>He contradicts himself of course by being pro gun control and then going around killing everybody with the same weapon, but besides that there better not be any insanity plea accepted.</p>
<p>If it comes to that. this manifesto may be a suicide note after all. he may be looking to commit suicide-by-cop or just off himself after a satisfactory (to him) body count.</p>

They trace their roots back to the ideology of Leon Trotsky and his &#8220;permanent revolution&#8221;, which stated communism should spread to other countries (eg Soviet funding) rather than keeping socialism strictly in Russia, as other Bolshies wanted.</p>
<p>The Bush administration was notories for this when we got involved with Iraq. Neocons, nowadays, have a very close relationship with Israel and Zionism (for obvious reasons if you normally hang around people like those on Amren). This is opposed to &#8220;paleo&#8221;cons, who believe America should leave other countries alone, and worry about our own problems. </p>
<p>The reason I say Breivik is a neocon is because of his strong support of Israel and adamant anti-Islamic views. Now, most Rightwingers, such as myself, would agree with him on Islamic threat to the West, but neocons have unusually (sometimes comical) views toward Islam.</p>

Both are the result of White society bending sensible rules to infiltrate these minorities into working organizations regardless of their capabilities and mental capacity. For many years while I was in a management position in a major aerospace company I saw marginally competent people &#8220;pushed&#8221; into positions of management based solely on race, plumbing and other non contributory factors associated with the new position. Inevitability when some self inflicted disaster occurred, it was always the fault of some Whitey and seldom was there any corrective action taken against the affirmative action person. Dorner is incapable of operating in a White structured society and will never be able to. It&rsquo;s a sorry plight that none of his former management could have made others aware of his problem, however had they done so they would have faced severe concessions as &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>

Your assumption is that any cause that disagrees with yours has no basis because it must be a liberal cause. Further, you assume anyone who comes around to an ideology unlike yours must have come to it not on the basis of their own experiences, but through some sort of vast, liberal propaganda campaign. This entire site&rsquo;s aim is to achieve the same &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; status we had prior to the 1960s civil rights legislation. Further, this organization assumes that any legislation or practice not favorable to whites automatically disfavors them. This organization does not recognize historical inequity, while at the same time purporting racial differences. But this site sees those differences as skin-deep, while disregarding a person&rsquo;s actual experience and history. It chooses what fits its world view, redefines white superiority as &#8220;racial realism,&#8221; and seeks to roll back all diversity programs, as well as any sort of program that favors the poor (a great majority of whom are not white). Your site thrives on fear, anger, and the paradoxical assertions of victimhood against non-white ethnic groups, from a following that believes they are being victimized. I honestly don&rsquo;t know where you would be without the word &#8220;liberal.&#8221; You&rsquo;d have no scapegoat, and thus, no real position.</p>
