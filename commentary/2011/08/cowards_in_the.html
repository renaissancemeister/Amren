				Cowards in the Archdiocese

				Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 02, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Frank Borzellieri is fired as Catholic school principal for "racism."
			</div>
			<p>
				Frank Borzellieri, who at one time spoke and wrote forthrightly on racial issues, has been fired as principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx. In recent years, Mr. Borzellieri has concentrated on serving his students, and had withdrawn from racial concerns. His record as a teacher and a principal has been exemplary, and he never spoke about racial matters with students or faculty. He was fired simply for holding certain views and having the courage to write about them.
			</p>
			<p>
				What prompted Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s firing was a hit piece in last Sunday&rsquo;s <em>New York Daily News</em>. Writer Cornine Lestch called him a &#8220;firebrand&#8221; with ties to a &#8220;white supremacist publication&#8221; which was, of course, <em>American Renaissance</em>. She quoted from his books, in which he pointed out that &#8220;diversity is a weakness&#8221; and that increasing numbers of blacks and Hispanics will bring a New Dark Age to America.
			</p>
			<p>
				Miss Lestch quoted the Southern Poverty Law Center as saying that Mr. Borzellieri was still &#8220;intimately involved&#8221; with AR. The SPLC got it wrong, of course. The last time Mr. Borzellieri spoke to an AR event was in 2002, and he has not written for us since a piece five years ago about the soccer World Cup.
			</p>
			<p>
				Miss Lestch made much in her article of the fact that the school where Mr. Borzellieri worked, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, is heavily black and Hispanic. She failed, of course, to mention that he is widely liked, or that during his two years as principal there had never been the slightest hint of &#8220;prejudice&#8221; or &#8220;discrimination.&#8221; Before his appointment at Mount Carmel, Mr. Borzellieri taught at St. Barnabas High School and Blessed Sacrament High School, always earning the highest ratings from students and colleagues; no one ever suggested he was in any way unfair to any student.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before making a career in education, Mr. Borzellieri was a columnist for the <em>Leader-Observer</em> newspaper chain in New York City. His tart columns on immigration and race created a furor, but were hugely popular, and his editor always defended him.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1993, Mr. Borzellieri was elected to School Board 24 in Queens, and was reelected twice, for 11 years of total service. He was an unabashed partisan of Western Civilization, and thus constantly in the news. He made headlines when he called a press conference to announce his call to remove library books that promoted homosexuality and contempt for America. Mr. Borzellieri was twice voted the most popular school board member, and would have continued to serve had his board not been eliminated as part of a reorganization of the city school system.
			</p>
			<p>
				He spoke at four <em>American Renaissance</em> conferences-1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002-where his witty, upbeat talks were always immensely popular. By our count, he wrote five articles for AR, the last in 2006.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is worth repeating: There was no incident or even allegation that prompted last Sunday&rsquo;s <em>Daily News</em> article. Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s extensive record could not be more public. A reporter simply hashed over Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s years-old writings and associations. This prompted bloggers to rave about his &#8220;hate filled belief system&#8221; and to claim that &#8220;Frank Borzellieri doesn&rsquo;t like anyone who isn&rsquo;t white.&#8221; Television and radio reporters piled on, besieging diocese headquarters and Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s home. Everyone wants to join the pack when a &#8220;racist&#8221; has been flushed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The diocese did not even wait 48 hours to fire Mr. Borzellieri. His record and his stack of outstanding recommendations from three schools counted for nothing in the face of baseless charges of &#8220;white supremacy.&#8221; The Archdiocese of New York mumbled something about Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s views being &#8220;found to be incompatible with the philosophy and practices&#8221; of the school, and gave him the boot. This contemptible behavior harks back to when the church used to hunt for witches and burned heretics at the stake.
			</p>
			<p>
				In recent years, as part of his dedication to a career of service to students, Mr. Borzellieri returned to graduate school, where he earned two master&rsquo;s degrees. He has heavy student debt-and no job. He would be deeply grateful to anyone who can send a check to:

										For every one degree of improvement he got out of his black and Hispanic students, he put forth ten degrees of effort compared to what would have been needed to improve Whites students by one degree.

										Whites need to start investing in Whites Only! We must start investing ourselves in those who can do the MOST with our efforts on their behalf, and I don&rsquo;t mean the Asians and the Jews. While they will advance faster than Whites, they will use their advancements to put themselves ahead of Whites.
									</p>
									<p>
										We must start thinking of what are the White Interests at stake in anything we do. Let the Diveristy educate the Diversity. Let White teachers educate White students!
									</p>
									<p>
										Transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your worst nightmares, and you are extremely right&hellip;

										This just confirms what Jared Taylor has said: You can have sterling credentials as an &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; without needing to do a single thing about it, just through pure lip service. If you&rsquo;re white, you associate with nobody but whites your entire life, you send your kids to an all-white private school and you live in a lily white neighborhood, and yet you mouth the appropriate platitudes about &#8220;diversity,&#8221; then you can have an A-1 spotless reputation as an &#8220;anti-racist.&#8221; If, however, you live in NYC most of your life, work at an integrated school, and show through your entire manner and conduct that you treat everyone fairly and equally, but you&rsquo;ve said some race-realistic things at one point or another, you lose your job. What a pathetically hypocritical age we live in!

										I&rsquo;ve heard Frank Borzellieri several times on the &#8220;Political Cesspool&#8221;. He is an American Patriot. He has also been betrayed by a very liberal and politically correct Catholic Church here in NYC. These sorts of attacks are going to become more and more numerous as the forces of political correctness see more and &#8220;threats&#8221; to their power. Hopefully more and more White men and women will come forward to speak out. Once we have most White men and women on the same page, these same forces won&rsquo;t know where to turn. They&rsquo;ll be seeing racists behind every rock, and hopefully will eventually reveal themselves to be the real racists, and haters of everything that represents European and White.

									<p>
										The very first indication that Comrade Lestch was on a witch hunt of the Marxist-Leninist sort, is right there for any but the most ossified or decayed mind to behold. Anyone smeared by the SPLC, gets an automatic consideration of circumstances in my book. Since Mr. Borzellieri is an honorable and dedicated man to both his work and freedom, he gets infinitely more than that from me, to say nothing of the &ldquo;benefit-of-the-doubt!&rdquo;
									</p>
									<p>
										That the Archdiocese of New York was also so quick to expel this decent and respectable man from his job, only adds to his credit. God forbid, that Mr. Borzellieri spend his free time defending Western Civilization and the race that built it as a teacher, and not molesting little boys in a black and white collar or some maroon cassock!
									</p>
									<p>
										I will be sending Mr. Borzellieri some money and a letter of encouragement as well, you can bet on that!

										Just by coincidence I was going to post a reply on a thread last week, it had to do with NYC and ABOPTL or some such said something about there were only guidos, Jews and Albanians in NYC, no whites. I was going to use Mr. Borzellieri (and Michael Levin) as exhibits to the contrary&hellip;
									</p>
									<p>
										I read this article and am completely disgusted with the NY Daily News and this Corinne Lestch person http://goo.gl/mNHgD It was a hatchet piece of the worst kind. Also, for me there was guilt by association as I had bought FB&rsquo;s book, in fact through AMREN.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Daily News seems to be stirring up the anti-white flames lately. The NY Post is widely hated by Afro NYers, Afro co-workers of mine go into paroxysms of rage just at the thought of someone reading this tabloid. Lately they&rsquo;ve tamed it down, including the comments section, while the News is ratcheting up the anti-white journalism and coupling it with Obama praise stories.

										The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life reports that one in 10 adult Americans used to be Catholic. One in three cradle Catholics have left the church.
										<p>
											Still, Catholics remain steady at one-quarter of the population, largely because of the growth of the Hispanic population. The <a rel="nofollow">&#8220;&gt;http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/survey_finds_onetenth_of_americans_used_to_be_catholic/&gt; Catholic News Agency reports &ldquo;Latinos now account for 45 percent of American Catholics aged 18-29.&rdquo; No wonder a number of Catholic bishops support illegal immigration: that&rsquo;s how they maintain their position. These bishops believe that illegal aliens have a right to the resources of the natives. I am unable to locate in the New Testament where Jesus said that charity was giving away others&rsquo; property.</a>

										The Church must have known about Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s views before he was hired. It&rsquo;s difficult to understand how the published ideas of a prominent person in the very locality could not have been. But when the Racist!-crying sharks move in, the weak and waffling flee, leaving the victim to be devoured.
									</p>
									<p>
										Many students and their parents probably knew as well. The truth is, of course, that the majority of blacks and Hispanics understand that whites believe them to be, on the average, intellectually inferior. And they believe the same thing! They fully grasp that the white man is in charge and make the best of it.
									</p>
									<p>
										The liberal argument concerning race must never be argued. It&rsquo;s obviously a house of cards built on shifting sand and can be demolished in ten minutes. The only defense available is the total shutting down of spoken or written truth about racial differences. To accomplish this, any race-realist must be demonized and treated as though his ideas are beyond the pale of allowable public discourse. To this way of thinking, had a Nazi spokesman offered to come to the U.S. and explain why Hitler had instituted concentration camps, he would have been banned. His theories of Jewish intellectual inferiority could have easily been refuted, and Americans would have realized what was transpiring in Germany.

									<p>
										Of course, most Americans know the truth about race, regardless of the wall of silence from the MSM elites.

										These people who fired Mr. B are acting according to the precepts of Christianity. Jesus said that if you lust after a woman, in your own mind; or hate someone, in your own mind, then you are guilty of adultery or murder, regardless of the lack of action taken to commit these sins.
									</p>
									<p>
										He did not say that the thoughts were warning-signs, prompting a self-examination or a repairing of a relationship &mdash; he equated the thought with the action.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, in Christianity, certain thoughts are sins to be harshly and immediately repressed, in oneself or in others.

										I disagree. I think &#8220;most Americans&#8221; are clueless about racial differences after enduring years of brainwashing by the schools and media. I still continue to hear the party line in private social settings about &#8220;blacks failing because of institutional racism.&#8221; It takes a knock in the head, sometimes several, or working in a non-white workplace before whites get the message.

										As someone who was born well after the Second Vatican Council, but was fortunate enough to manage to acquire, nonethless, a Pre-Vatican II faith and religious education, it should be obvious &mdash; clearly obvious &mdash; that the &#8220;Catholic Church&#8221; that we see nowadays is only the religious arm of a socialist, anti-white, modernistic approach to mankind.
									</p>
									<p>
										True Catholicism figures not at all in this new orientation to the entire world, Catholic and non-Catholic alike. Rather, it is viewed as both archaic and to be discountenanced at whatever cost. The erstwhile prestige of the Pre-Vatican II Church and that Church&rsquo;s historical continuity with Catholicism, is abused by a Post-Vatican II Church, which while maintaning the same name, has long ago given up the same Faith.
									</p>
									<p>
										That the &#8220;Church&#8221; is so hypocritically concerned about this man&rsquo;s personal opinions on matters which do not touch the faith at all is only a further outward expression of the faith they long ago tacitly renounced at a false council held between 1962-65.

									</p>
									<p>
										But where in heaven&rsquo;s name did you come up with the nutty idea about hate and murder?
									</p>
									<p>
										This is another example of the idiocy that afflicts liberals.

										Frank needs to sue. I am not just saying this because I despise how the church has treated him, but because his firing was motivated by his race and his views. If he was black would the Daily News care he attended an NAACP conference? No they wouldn&rsquo;t and neither would he befired for it. In fact, I doubt he would even be contriversial or even known to begin with.

										&#8220;The Vatican II Catholic Church has replaced traditional Christian sins with the new sins of racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism.&#8221;
									</p>
									<p>
										Brava, Eva! And NONE of these supposed &#8216;sins&rsquo; is in the Canon of Holy Writ, nor were considered &#8216;evil&rsquo;&hellip;. in over 20 CENTURIES of Christian witness!
									</p>
									<p>
										Andrew Fraser&rsquo;s new book, &#8220;The WASP Question&#8221; clearly delineates that something CHANGED around 1100 AD, which shifted the focus of Christianity from being a united culturo-ethnological faith for the Peoples of Europe, to an overweening, universalist &#8216;Faith&rsquo; that was the predecessor of the Modern Multicultural. The Orthodox consider this event to be the Schism of 1054, over the &#8216;filioque&rsquo; in the Creed. They are correct&hellip; but to assume that Byzantinism is free from taint, is to speak of things with rosy glasses. Christianity is an ethnological-biological faith, much like the mosaic faith it replaced. This faith was &#8220;ONCE given unto&hellip;.&#8221; the residents of the &#8220;Ecumene,&#8221; which comprised the race and folk of Europe.
									</p>
									<p>
										Moving ahead 1000 years, and we have the &#8216;effects&rsquo; of Vat. II. This went EVEN FURTHER in their &#8216;invite the world, invade the world&rsquo; as a &#8216;faith&rsquo; that doesn&rsquo;t give a D*MN about those Euroepeans who comprise the overwhelming majority of saints, doctors, martyrs, and holy ones of the Faith the &#8216;Church of what&rsquo;s happening now&rsquo; so easily disparages. Borzellieri is merely the most visible (and current) &#8216;victim&rsquo; of a group that once said they were &#8216;semper edeam,&rsquo; and now clearly show themselves to be liars to that fact.
									</p>
									<p>
										&#8220;Come out of her, and be ye separate, lest ye partake of her sins&rsquo; saith the Apostle. I concur. All &#8216;faiths&rsquo; that disparage the Christendom peoples, are kin to the universalist paradigm that has ruled Rome for over 1000 years, and was the philosophical Grund, for the modern multiculturalism we now find so abhorrent.

										To posit the notion that &#8220;lusting&#8221; does not include thinking is absurd.
									</p>
									<p>
										My point was that no adultery was commited-only thinking about it. It is &#8220;thought crime,&#8221; according to Jesus.
									</p>
									<p>
										This attitude is the precursor of political correctness, and is one of the reasons that I think that Christianity carries the seeds of liberalism.
									</p>
									<p>
										As far as the teaching equating angry thoughts to murder, just look at Matt. 5:21-23.
									</p>
									<p>
										You should have known where to find that, but your post illustrates an important truth: The more a person knows about the Bible, the less he believes in it.

										I think why so-called &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; sites are being given an unfairly bad rap has to do with the nature of what they need to contest.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is the effective NAACP (and other liberal groups) position that IQs and behaviors are the same across races, and that therefore any difference in financial success must be due to white racism. Therefore, government must reverse discriminate against whites until non-whites have the same financial level of success.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is unfortunately necessary for any group, then, wishing to argue against this reverse discrimination, to have to challenge its basis-again, that IQ and behavior are the same across races. And so groups like Amren unfortunately need to highlight and point out evidence that NAACP&rsquo;s basis is fundamentally wrong. But that&rsquo;s where it falls victim to &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; charges -&#8221;Ah! You&rsquo;re saying whites are better and smarter!!!&#8221; But such groups are never saying that just to be &#8220;mean&#8221; but only to fight against reverse discrimination, which unfortunately requires challenging NAACP&rsquo;s false assumption that they base it on.
									</p>
									<p>
										If NAACP wasn&rsquo;t arguing equality of people in order to advocate for reverse discrimination, whites wouldn&rsquo;t need to challenge their position on that. Nobody wants to examine ugly things about racial differences in IQ and behavior, but so long as NAACP is using that as the basis for reverse discrimination, such analysis needs to be done.

										The Church will only recover with Militant Catholicism that recognizes the Eternal Truths. Many Catholics, for which the number is growing, are becoming more militant in their Faith; that is to protect and defend the Truths that are inherent in the Church.
									</p>
									<p>
										I expected this inexcusable action against Mr. Borzellieri, who attended a Catholic University and received Graduate Degrees in Education, and from the reports, treated all of his students fairly; so much so that none of them knew of his Political beliefs. Try getting a Marxist Professor, a La Raza Chica, or NAACP Queen to keep their mouths shut, and their opinions to themselves. Good luck.

									<p>
										No, Frank is not alone, and I will be sending some money to his Box, with deep appreciation for having the spine to say what we all know is the truth.
									</p>
									<p>
										I suggest that when one of us hits the Lottery, that we do what has been discussed on another site, and form our own Whites-only European-American Schools. Frank, there&rsquo;s a job waiting for you when that happens.

										It is time for whites to &#8220;cut off&#8221; contributions to the Catholic church and other religious organizations that promote unrestricted immigration and race-mixing.<br />
										Hitting them in the pocketbook will most certainly get their attention.  One can be a good Catholic without contributing to the corrupt heirarchy . . .
