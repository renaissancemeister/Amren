			<h1>
				Newt Gingrich: The White Party&rsquo;s Candidate?
			</h1>
			<p>
				Henry Wolff, American Renaissance, December 9, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				The former House Speaker has a long history of being anti-white.
			</div>
			<p>
				Newt Gingrich is the most anti-white candidate in the GOP presidential field. In fact, he may be one of the most anti-white Republicans ever. It is true that <a href="https://cis.org/immigrants-filled-most-new-jobs-in-Texas">81 percent</a> of the jobs Rick Perry says he brought to Texas went to newly arrived immigrants (93 percent of whom were illegals), and he says that denying in-state tuition to illegals is heartless, but Newt Gingrich makes the him look like Tom Tancredo by comparison.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 2010 midterm elections, nearly <a href="https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/the-white-party/">90 percent</a> of votes for Republicans were cast by whites. John McCain&rsquo;s presidential support was of an identical complexion. Writing for <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, Thomas Edsall, like Steve Sailer and Pat Buchanan before him, <a href="https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/the-white-party/">has dubbed</a> the GOP &#8220;The White Party.&#8221; But rather than consolidating his proven white base and welcoming white working class voters who are <a href="https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/the-future-of-the-obama-coalition/">increasingly defecting</a> to the GOP, Newt Gingrich seems determined to dispossess that base while mollycoddling groups that will never vote for his party in significant numbers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Immigration</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				On immigration, the former House Speaker is liberal. In a recent primary debate, Mr. Gingrich <a href="https://news.nationalpost.com/2011/11/23/newt-gingrichs-immigration-policiy-agrivates-republican-base/">set up</a> a restrictionist straw man so he could attack it with pure sentiment:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					If you&rsquo;ve been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you&rsquo;ve been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out. I don&rsquo;t see how the party that says it&rsquo;s the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Of course, most mainstream restrictionists do not call for mass deportation, but for <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/learn/issues/american-workers/attrition-through-enforcement-true-middl.html">attrition through enforcement</a>. Those who do favor deportation would happily send the kids and grandkids home with their family so as to keep it together. Mr. Gingrich went on to say he&rsquo;s &#8220;prepared to take the heat for saying let&rsquo;s be humane&#8221; toward illegal immigrants. Sadly, Mr. Gingrich <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/election_2012_republican_presidential_primary">did not</a> take the &#8220;Perry Plunge&#8220;-a precipitous polling drop following maudlin immigration remarks. This is probably because other candidates in the field <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClGkDUO3DF8&amp;feature=player_embedded">seem</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW_nDFKAmCo">to</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCyTQEANlmM">be</a> self-destructing and Herman Cain has finally &#8220;<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/herman-cain-suspends-campaign-affair-allegations_n_1131637.html">suspended</a>&#8221; his campaign.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/1211/69633.html">In 1986</a>, Mr. Gingrich voted for the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that granted citizenship to three million illegal immigrants, a move he later said he regretted. Today, he <a href="https://www.newt.org/solutions/immigration">supports</a> a &#8220;path to legality,&#8221; but not citizenship, for illegal immigrants who have &#8220;deep ties&#8221; in the United States, and repatriation for those who do not. &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/gingrich-citizen-juries-should-decide-which-illegal-immigrants-stay-or-go/2011/11/27/gIQAjlOL2N_blog.html">Citizen juries</a>&#8221; made up of ordinary citizens from local communities would be responsible for making millions of individual rulings on who stays and who goes. Even David Frum <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2011/11/28/opinion/frum-gingrich-immigration/">finds</a> this proposal ridiculous, but Bill Clinton<br>
				<hr>
				approves</a>, so you know it&rsquo;s conservative. The Pew Hispanic Center released a <a href="https://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/12/01/unauthorized-immigrants-length-of-residency-patterns-of-parenthood/">report</a> last week suggesting that <a href="https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/gingrichs-immigration-plan-could-benefit-millions-study-finds/?popup=false">millions</a> of immigrants would receive permanent residency under Mr. Gingrich&rsquo;s plan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Gingrich has also voiced support for the provision of the DREAM Act that would grant citizenship to illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as minors and who serve in the military.
			</p>
			<p>
				To temper his pro-immigrant rhetoric, Mr. Gingrich <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/29/us-campaign-gingrich-immigration-idUSTRE7AS09E20111129">has proposed</a> defunding self-declared &#8220;sanctuary cities,&#8221; but once Mr. Gingrich&rsquo;s qualified amnesty is enacted, only those unfortunate souls who couldn&rsquo;t forge convincing evidence of &#8220;deep ties&#8221; would need sanctuary.
			</p>
			<p>
				The former House Speaker <a href="https://www.newt.org/solutions/immigration">wants</a> America to have a &#8220;robust&#8221; and &#8220;attractive&#8221; program of legal immigration, with an expanded guest worker program that would give businesses the low-wage labor they crave.
			</p>
			<p>
				On his election website, Mr. Gingrich explains the rationale for his immigration policies by <a href="https://www.newt.org/solutions/immigration">spreading</a> the <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2011/07/what_is_white_nationalism_a_reply_to_dean_malik.html">myth</a> that America is a &#8220;proposition nation&#8221;:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					At the core of being American is a thorough understanding of American exceptionalism. We are a nation not defined by place or ethnic heritage, but by the collective understanding that we are &#8220;endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221;
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				There are good reasons why Numbers USA gives Mr. Gingrich a D- rating on immigration.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Racial Preferences</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Peter Bradley has an <a href="https://www.vdare.com/articles/newt-gingrich-gop-s-anti-white-quota-king">excellent piece</a> at VDARE detailing Newt Gingrich&rsquo;s wavering positions on racial preferences. He was once a staunch opponent: &#8220;I want to promise here tonight that we are going to pursue an all out effort to end affirmative racism in America,&#8221; Mr. Gingrich declared at the 1995 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).
			</p>
			<p>
				Just over a year later, Mr. Gingrich was joining forces with black conservative celebrity J.C. Watts to frustrate Ward Connerly&rsquo;s push for nationwide legislation based on California&rsquo;s anti-affirmative action Proposition 209. Mr. Gingrich was also instrumental in killing the Civil Rights Act of 1997-another initiative against racial preferences-while Speaker of the House.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bradley says that &#8220;more than any other person, Newt Gingrich is responsible for the continuation of anti-white racial preferences in America.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Pandering to Hispanics</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Newt Gingrich takes Hispandering to a level that would make John McCain and George W. Bush blush, and is as eager as Karl Rove to brown the GOP. <i>Politico</i> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53579.html">says</a> that &#8220;of the top Republican prospects for 2012, Gingrich leads in Latino outreach.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				While in office, one of Speaker Gingrich&rsquo;s &#8220;pet projects&#8221; <a href="https://www.prfaa.com/news/?p=682">was</a> a bill that would allow Puerto Ricans to hold a referendum to decide the fate of their island: whether it would become the 51st state, a sovereign nation, or continue as a US territory. The plebiscite would be held once every ten years until a majority chose either statehood or independence. As James Lubinskas<br>
				<hr>
				wrote</a> at the time, if the bill passed and Puerto Ricans opted for statehood, the US would be &#8220;importing AIDS, crime, poverty and other Third-World problems. Four million Spanish-speakers who don&rsquo;t even consider themselves Americans would gain political representation at the expense of current citizens.&#8221; The bill passed the Speaker&rsquo;s House by just one vote, but was never taken up in the Senate. Last year, Mr. Gingrich interviewed Puerto Rico&rsquo;s governor and voiced his continued support for a referendum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Granting hundreds of thousands of Hispanics permanent residence in the US would be nothing new for Mr. Gingrich. According to <i>Politico</i>, during his time as House Speaker, Mr. Gingrich <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53579.html">was</a> &#8220;instrumental in passing legislation that allowed hundreds of thousands of Central American refugees [to] become legal permanent residents of the United States.&#8221; The legislation was the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/PUBLAW/HTML/PUBLAW/0-0-0-15244.html">Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act</a> which Numbers USA <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/learn/illegal-immigration/seven-amnesties-passed-congress.html#4">says</a> increased the U.S. population by 966,480 in the decade after its passage.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2009, Mr. Gingrich founded <i>The Americano</i>-a bilingual &#8220;conservative&#8221; webzine that &#8220;celebrates the richness of Hispanic Heritage&#8221;-as part of Gingrich Productions, which he runs with his third wife. Mr. Gingrich may be able to read the site <i>en Español</i> since he <a href="https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning-the-language/2007/04/more_on_newt_gingrichs_spanish_1.html">has been taking</a> Spanish lessons for the past few years.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Gingrich put his Spanish skills to the test in 2007 when he recorded a YouTube video apologizing to Hispanics for<br>
				<hr>
				having said</a>, &#8220;We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto.&#8221; He recorded the entire apology in the language of living in a ghetto:
			</p>

				<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Og0HqSZVKqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>
				Mr. Gingrich may have been a precipitating factor in what Steve Sailer has called the &#8220;<a href="https://www.vdare.com/articles/karl-rove-architect-of-the-minority-mortgage-meltdown">minority mortgage meltdown</a>.&#8221; For much of the past decade, mortgage giant Freddie Mac hired Mr. Gingrich through his Gingrich Group at between $25,000 and $30,000 per month. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-16/gingrich-said-to-be-paid-at-least-1-6-million-by-freddie-mac.html"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>, between 1999 and 2002, Mr. Gingrich &#8220;consulted with Freddie Mac executives on a program to expand home ownership, an idea [Freddie Mac's chief lobbyist Mitchell] Delk said he pitched to President George W. Bush&#8216;s White House.&#8221; Mr. Delk said he had a long discussion with Mr. Gingrich about the idea, including &#8220;what the benefits are to communities, what the benefits could be for Republicans and particularly their relationship with Hispanics.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Since Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s second term, Mr. Gingrich has been a proponent of the &#8220;Opportunity Society&#8221; platform that encourages property ownership. This was the prototype for President George W. Bush&rsquo;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_36/b3898001_mz001.htm">Ownership Society</a>,&#8221; which, in practice, meant lower mortgage standards for minorities, with an eye to winning Hispanic support.

				<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLUbb2DUYGk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>
				Mr. Gingrich&rsquo;s pandering is not limited to Hispanics. In 1997, when J.C. Watts called Jesse Jackson and then D.C. mayor Marion Barry &#8220;race hustling poverty pimps,&#8221; then-Speaker Gingrich <a href="https://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=5715">apologized</a> to Mr. Jackson on behalf of Congressman Watts, and <a href="https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985908,00.html">invited</a> him to sit in the Speaker&rsquo;s gallery with his (second) wife during the State of the Union speech. In 2009, Mr. Gingrich teamed up with Al Sharpton for a five-city <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/newt-gingrich-al-sharpton-team-rally-education-tour-article-1.413138">education tour</a> &#8220;aimed at bridging the achievement gap for minorities in schools.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Presidential candidates are fond of saying &#8220;my record speaks for itself.&#8221; In the case of Newt Gingrich, this is certainly true, and whites would do well to study his record closely before pulling the lever next year.

											This isn&rsquo;t just about Gingrich. The GOP and mainstream conservative movement have been getting steadily more anti-white over the years. It&rsquo;s almost hard to believe that as House Speaker, Gingrich used the term &#8220;affirmative racism.&#8221; It&rsquo;s impossible to imagine any prominent GOP politician saying something like that today. AA as an issue has become taboo in the GOP.

											I hope the &#8220;Stupid Party&#8221; cottons on to this truth before giving us another non-choice for presidential candidate.
										</p>
										<p>
											When I first heard the hoopla about Gingrich, in 1994, I said to myself then: this guy is no revolutionary, he is a throwback. He reminded me of Marshall Foche&rsquo;s quote: &#8220;Generals always begin the next war by fighting the last one.&#8221; His Reagan retro act is two decades staler now, that is the only difference. The man still lacks the power weigh race and ethnicity into his political formulations.

											As per a nation without an ethnic heritage, pure huey.

											The people who made this nation great and who were the initial colonial population were mostly English, Scottish, Dutch, Heugenot French, and German. They were the Americans until the great immigration attacks. The Irish were a compatible and welcome addition although there was some initial friction.

											Voting in 2012 is basically &#8220;rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic&#8221; as Thomas Chittum once said. That being the case, I recognize that symbols are as important to any movement as money or members of a party. It is fairly simple. Black people rallied around Obama for the same reason that large numbers of whites rallied around Sarah Palin. Because of a desire to see themselves reflected in the highest office in the land.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am not under any illusions that Newt Gingrich is my friend, on any issue ranging from foreign policy to immigration. But I do believe that he despises me less than Obama does, and I also know that he looks somewhat like me. And the alternative right mantra that &#8220;it has to get worse before it gets better&#8221; can only go so far.
										</p>
										<p>
											Obama&rsquo;s election was a great boon for white racial consciousness, but he has done all the good (or harm) that he is going to do in that respect. So yeah, I&rsquo;ll hold my nose and vote for Gingrich. Sue me.

											Here we are in the United States in 2011, where demographic transformation is so brazenly obvious that only the truly delusional can deny it, where general cultural and moral decline are equally apparent, where gross hypocrisy and dishonesty are clear for everyone to see, not to mention the daily rape and murder of our people in the streets&hellip;and yet this anti-white clown Gingrich sees his star rising in the &#8220;white party.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											We are now living in that very &#8220;future&#8221; which far sighted men of our race had predicted. The future is now, and yet we get, well, Gingrich. It is to laugh.
										</p>
										<p>
											Even if he turns out to be yet another flash in the pan, what of the rest of the field? Not one, even at this late date, would dare utter so much as a single word in support of white interests. Not one. Again, this in the &#8220;white party.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											Three years into the Age of Obama, and this is what the Republican Party can dredge up. Three years into one of the most serious economic crises in modern history, and this is what the GOP can muster. Decades into a shocking degradation of civilization at every level, and this is what modern conservatism can field. If the situation weren&rsquo;t so tragic, it would be downright funny. It vaguely reminds me of those old Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy books, only non-fiction.
										</p>
										<p>
											Some time ago, there was a debate on this forum concerning secession, pro or con. I took the con side, arguing that we could reclaim the vast majority of America. Perhaps even reclaim it as America per se, under the American banner, if you get my meaning.
										</p>
										<p>
											I was wrong. I still maintain serious reservations about the feasibility of white secession, but I suppose that, when you get right down to it, feasibility is something of a relative thing. Which is to say that white secession may indeed be a long shot, but reclaiming America per se is impossible. So who has the better of the argument? I&rsquo;ll take a long shot over the impossible.
										</p>
										<p>
											If whites are to have a land and civilization of our own on this continent, it will have to start in only a part of it, founded on far more solid and enduring principles than the United States. Perhaps in the far mists of time such a White Republic will be able to expand and, eventually, cover all or most of the land that the United States occupies today. But that grand possibility is so distant that it&rsquo;s really not worth thinking about.
										</p>
										<p>
											What is worth thinking about is starting smaller, much smaller. Time to recognize that the U.S. is never going to be restored or redeemed. It&rsquo;s just not going to happen. We&rsquo;ve got to learn to let it go, and instead turn our attention to building something fresh and new. If such an aspiration ever turns into reality, it will be under a different banner, a banner all its own.

											Well, since the stock of the country eventually determines the imprint of a country then all the candidates including Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann are deliberately ignorant, unwilling to broach the issue, or sunnily stupid, on the issue of race. Gingrich may be worse than these two but ultimately he like they have no problem committing suicide.

											Ron Paul is the only one I would vote for (like I did in the 2008 Republican primary).
										</p>
										<p>
											And, for those who say he would be a wasted vote, I say I wasted a vote on McCain in 2008. And, Bush in 2000 and 2004. I&rsquo;ve been voting for people that I really didn&rsquo;t want to get elected anymore than their opposition. I&rsquo;ve been voting for people I&rsquo;m literally settling on. If that isn&rsquo;t a wasted vote, I don&rsquo;t know what is.
										</p>
										<p>
											Ron Paul is an honest man who loves his country and has never betrayed the Constitution. He has integrity and cannot be bought! In the long run, this is all that counts for me and it should be all that counts for all Americans.

										<p>
											Oh, and he&rsquo;s not a lawyer by trade and that makes him a slam dunk!

											Gingrich lost my vote when I read he has put forth the Gingrich Amnesty Proposal. He wants blanket immunity and citizenship for the illegal immigrants in America. Numbersusa.com has all the information on this. It is an excellent site.

											And the lying, liberal media is spewing its usual brand of lies. At Numbers USA read: &#8220;Bogus Polls (that leave out Attrition) Are Popping Up Everywhere To Proclaim That Americans Now Support Amnesty&#8221;.

											What our fiscally compromised country needs is a moratorium of all immigration until we can repair and recover our economy. That&rsquo;s just plain common sense. And that means we have to vote Obama out in 2012.

											I completely disagree with you. The important thing now is to get the process of reclamation started&hellip;a soon as possible. Millions of Native Born White Americans have yet to contemplate what they will have to give up for racial minority status. And among the the things that they are to have to give up is an enormous amount of living space. Not only that, all the wonderful environmental amenities that Native Born White Americans take for granted are going to be lost. Millions of Native Born White Americans are utterly clueless as to how unpleasant life is going to be on a daily basis.
										</p>
										<p>
											Here is the real choice facing millions of Native Born White Americans: Racial extinction after ecological collapse or expulsion of millions of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.
										</p>
										<p>
											The job of Native Born White American Patriots is 1) to set a standard of resistance that emboldens our fellow Native Born White Americans to revolt and to confront our fellow Native Born White Americans with the following question: What are you willing to give up for racial minority status within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;. Pat Buchanan could have done this in his new book..but he didn&rsquo;t..instead he pushed the immigration moratorium which is nothing less than a Native Born White American race-repacement Trojan Horse. Buchanan&rsquo;s book apparently has been a big flop. A book with spleen and passion.. with no punches pulled..a book which confronts millions of Native Born White Americans with the question..what are you willing to give up fo racial minority status within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;&hellip;would have been widely read&hellip;especially by our enemy. Buchanan wasn&rsquo;t the least bit serious..pure policy wonk garbage.
										</p>
										<p>
											If Native Born White Americans had not been allowed to leave the old suburbs-liberal smart growth eco policy-after the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, nonwhite immigration would have been shut down to 0 permanently at at least 20 years ago. I wish Jared Tayor would say this in public. It is an important thought experiment.

											So yet again we will be left with no one looking out for the interests of Whites. And 2016 will be even worse due to our changing demographics.

											Jupiter,
										</p>
										<p>
											There are well over 100 million non-whites in this country, but it&rsquo;s the situation with whites that I find most disturbing. Various destructive trends, some of which I noted above, are now so advanced and obvious as to be undeniable.
										</p>
										<p>
											Yet what do we see in terms of white reaction? Last month it was a love affair with Herman Cain. Today, Gingrich is the Cinderella. Sure, it&rsquo;s kind of cool that Ron Paul is doing fairly well, but he doesn&rsquo;t touch race with a ten foot pole. For him, everything is reduced to dollars (preferably gold or silver dollars). It is this crass materialism, whether dressed up in Founder&rsquo;s garb or just Wall Street/Goldman Sachs grasping, that has become the signature of the United States. It&rsquo;s one of the major reasons for our fall, as money/materialism has trumped race again and again. That&rsquo;s just the American way.
										</p>
										<p>
											A nation that carried forward a true white civilization must be grounded on firmer principles than that. Ron Paul&rsquo;s only guiding principle is that everyone should be free to make a buck. To which I say fine, generally speaking, but there is more to life than that. And there is certainly far more to a civilization worthy of the name than that.
										</p>
										<p>
											I&rsquo;d love to reclaim America as much as you. I just don&rsquo;t see it as a viable possibility, based on the reaction (or lack thereof) of the mass of whites to the obvious and startling trends that even the dullest bulb can see all around him. I now see, and I kid you not, evangelical churches flying the Israeli flag and holding &#8220;I Love Israel&#8221; rallies. Even after years of Obama and in the middle of an economic crisis of the first order, whites gobble up movies like The Blind Side and The Help. Normal, &#8220;conservative&#8221; whites do this, not just leftist kooks.
										</p>
										<p>
											At some point, we&rsquo;ve got to ask some very basic questions. One of these is, &#8220;Who is our target market?&#8221; By that I mean, what section of the white population has solid instincts and are highly resistant to the cultural, racial and propaganda assaults against us?
										</p>
										<p>
											Those are the kind of people we want. The rest, unfortunately, are just a liability.
										</p>
										<p>
											I would estimate, and I think this is extremely generous, that our maximum target market is 10 to 20 percent of the white population. Perhaps, and I definitely think this is excessively generous, we could push that number as high as 50 percent, or even a tad higher.
										</p>
										<p>
											Those percentages might be considerably higher in the small, more obviously blood and soil nations of Europe. But we&rsquo;ve got to face the fact that the United States, regardless of the perfidy of certain hostile groups, has had philosophical problems from the start. This preference for propositions over blood and soil have plagued us from the beginning, and the white population of this continent has pretty much always been divided on the racial question, sometimes to a disastrous degree.
										</p>
										<p>
											So when you take well over 100 million non-whites and add that to the large percentage of whites who will never rally to our cause, but only oppose us, I just don&rsquo;t see how one can expect to reclaim the United States per se. And even if we had that kind of power, wouldn&rsquo;t we want to use it to create an enduring homeland for our people, and reject the &#8220;proposition nation&#8221; that America has become famous/infamous for?
										</p>
										<p>
											But if, at least under certain conditions, as many as ten or twenty percent of American whites could support the idea of a white homeland, then you&rsquo;re talking twenty to forty million people. That&rsquo;s not bad. If such a homeland were ever established, it would initiate an evolutionary process of whites on this continent. Those with sounder instincts and a desire to live in a better civilization would, over time, find their way to the White Republic. Their numbers would increase naturally, as certainly the new white nation would be very family friendly.
										</p>
										<p>
											Those whites that prefer the multiracial sewer could remain in it, where they will decline as a result of everything from low fertility, miscegenation, to outright murder at the hands of the non-whites they so adore, or at least can&rsquo;t imagine living without.
										</p>
										<p>
											The reality, or so it seems to me, is that we are at an evolutionary bottleneck, and a large section of the white population simply isn&rsquo;t going to make it. For whatever reason, many whites are highly susceptible to the destructive propaganda and general degeneracy of our age. Then again, many are not. Having a genuine white nation on this continent would allow a healthier and more capable white population to grow and prosper. I don&rsquo;t see that as a bad thing, but rather as something good.

											Whether we can reclaim a smaller White polity that would later possibly

											form a nucleus for a reborn continent-wide America, or simply take back the entire country community by community, a precondition for any of these scenarios seems to be de-centralization, reversing the dictatorial powers accumulated by Washington, the dethroning of an arrogant judiciary, and the increase of border and ports-of-entry enforcement (by either Federal or, better yet, state forces).

											Several years back my father knew Newt Gingrich (my dad passed away in 1996). Dad was in law enforcement and dabbled in local politics as well as holding his state&rsquo;s PBA presidency and other positions through the years. I will never forget that he warned me long ago about Newt G. He said that Mr. Gingrich was very politically ambitious, was not at all a conservative, and that he would never trust him. My father was always right about people.
										</p>
										<p>
											Since Herman Cain is out of the race I am at a loss as to which candidate to back. It&rsquo;s never too early for grassroots and social networking pep rallies but it does seem too late for the Republicans to bring forward a worthy runner. So far, I like Michelle Bachman in the place of Cain but I fear she has no chance because of the money and clout behind Gingrich and Romney (I believe Perry will be out of the running soon enough and I don&rsquo;t like him, either).
										</p>
										<p>
											Ron Paul is someone who seems the most constitutional to me but his wish to close foreign military bases worldwide is sort of scary to me. However, that said, I will probably wind up voting for him if he becomes the candidate or for Bachmann if by some miracle she gets the candidacy. I rather hope Paul will since I just cannot get behind Gingrich and I think Paul might be able to beat Obama.
										</p>
										<p>
											Thanks, Mr. Wolff, for your eye-opening article. Gingrich definitely avoids these topics on his website.

											Both Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan can&rsquo;t come right out and say it, like David Duke can, because they are in different positions than Duke is, and would truly harm themselves, and in Paul&rsquo;s case, his Congressional constituents, if he did.
										</p>
										<p>
											Ron Paul attacks fiat money, which is killing our Nation and its purchasing power, and the Federal Reserve, which is Unconstitutional, along with foreign alliances that George Washington warned us about.
										</p>
										<p>
											Ron Paul is addressing the Constitution-crushing problems like membership in the UN, and over-regulations on Businesses, that cannot compete with contries like China, that have none of these EPA regulations to worry about.
										</p>
										<p>
											Buchanan knows his target audience and says what he has to, to reach the broadest amount of people without damaging the message about the decline of a once great Nation, and Superpower.
										</p>
										<p>
											People who read his book will wake up to what is going on, but we can&rsquo;t push them away with the very stark realities of life, that they seem reluctant to accept. Instead, giving them what they need in small, steady doses will bring them around to reality, and then they will be ready for a coherant discussion on AmRen.

											The arguments of trainspotter above appear very racial realist, but they overlook economics. Money really talks &#038; the Big Beast is utterly bankrupt. This is a game changer because in a harsh battle for resources, primitive loyalties come to the fore. The Whites will shed their soft pandering to the other &#038; become more realistic. Self murder is only tolerable when its painless. As politics redefines along America&rsquo;s obvious fault line, race, new voices will arise calling our people back to their core identity. Then the whole of the USA can be reclaimed.

											Political opinion polls, this early in the game, don&rsquo;t mean much-especially for a caucus state like Iowa. Wasn&rsquo;t Herman Cain leading some of the polls recently? And, even if his baggage hadn&rsquo;t derailed him, does anyone really believe that Republican primary voters would nominate a black man?
										</p>
										<p>
											In Iowa, it&rsquo;s totally down to the number of people who will come out to caucus. And this number depends a great deal on the ability of each candidate to pack the caucuses with their supporters. It was said that Obama bussed people in from Chicago to pose as Iowa residents. How many Mormons do you suppose Romney could bring in? Or how many non-Mormons who just want a free bus ride, lots of food, and a little excitement?
										</p>
										<p>
											Iowa is always touted by the press, but how important is it in the long run? Many candidates who win there lose the nomination in the end.
										</p>
										<p>
											The liberal press is determined to see Obama reelected by hook or crook. Thus, it will do its utmost to see that the most unpalatable Republican is nominated. This won&rsquo;t bring Obama any more votes, but-as in the case with McCain-it could cause conservatives to stay away from the polls. We all must see that this doesn&rsquo;t happen.

											Sigh! If I look hard enough, I can find a reason to avoid any candidate. There are so many special interests claiming to define the party in question. A candidate has to have the &#8220;right answers&#8221; for things like abortion, immigration, foreign entanglements, Israel, race issues, taxation, religious expression, property rights, State&rsquo;s rights, etc., etc. Answering is a matter of avoiding the personal destruction by the liberal media awaiting anything other than a egalitarian, PC answer.
										</p>
										<p>
											Gingrich and Paul are the ones to me that have believable answers to questions, Gingrich of course, being more of a dancer/dodger but capable of something original and at least marginal credible.
										</p>
										<p>
											I think there is a lot more to politics than which candidate has the right attitude toward Israel, immigration, and affirmative racism.

											The patriots have one option; Romney. I admit he&rsquo;s almost unpalatable, but the alternative is the Whore from Georgia. Romney vetoed the state Dream Act in Massachusetts. He says no amnesty, finally. The Whore from Ga. will sell out our Republic on the first day he&rsquo;s in office. With Romney in office we can beat the interloper that&rsquo;s illegally in office now. Also can elect new majorities in both houses. The best we can hope for is several Supreme Ct. vacancies to open up; fill them with patriots and let the states deal with immigration. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s Romney or bust.

											I realize that you are very depressed these days. The best way to deal with it is to fight back. You provide some of the highest quality commentary on the Native Born White Patriot websites..don&rsquo;t quite on us now.
										</p>
										<p>
											I would never vote for Ron Paul. He is an unadulterated corporate whore who wants to race-replace millions of Native Born White Americans with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. This is a declaration of war against the Native Born White American Majority. So the claim that Ron Paul is antiwar is a bold-face lie. I argued this point in the comments section in Justin Raimondo&rsquo;s antiwar.com columns. None of leftists-liberals who read antiwar.com were able to take me down in debate, so the antiwar.com collective decided to ban me.
										</p>
										<p>
											As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the Republicans and Democrats can go ahead and start a nuclear WW3 in the Middle East&hellip;I will never vote for Ron Paul..he war mongers against the Native Born White American Majority.
										</p>
										<p>
											Trainspoter
										</p>
										<p>
											If there is a will there is a way. When it finally sinks into the heads of millions of Native Born White Americans what they are going to have to give up for racial minority status&hellip;there will be a full blown Native Born White American race-revolt against race-replacement at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. The White Homeland stuff is a whole lot of nonsense..a White Homeland means being surrounded by China, India, Pakistan, Korea and Iran. It is an evolving situation..and the situation is evolving to a full-blown Native Born White American revolt against race-replacement. It will happen.

										</p>
										<p>
											The analogy to the bombing of Pearl Harbor is not a valid one. That was an &#8220;Act of War&#8221; even though our POTUS FDR most likely knew about it well before hand,
										</p>
										<p>
											Although immigration is a problem, I don&rsquo;t think that it can hold a candle to the greatest threat to our very existence i.e. Criminal Blacks and Muslims. All our governments for the last 60 years have fostered the Black underclass and controlled it to a degree with entitlements and kept themselves in power via the Black vote. That genie is out of the bottle and to re-elect the present regime is to guarantee a further degradation of this society band perhaps its end. Does anyone think that Ron Paul has a snow ball in Hell of a chance to beat the Obama juggernaut? Anyone who launches a 3rd party run now is going to re-elect Obama. It&rsquo;ll be Ross (I&rsquo;m ALL ears&#8221;) all over again. And Barack (who actually could give Ross a run in the ears dept.) will be re&#8221;POTUS&#8221;ized.

											One thing that really irritates me about the libertarian movement is that they have their heads up the dark place when it comes to race.
										</p>
										<p>
											Their stance on open borders ignores common sense. If you bring a bunch of 3rd-world people into a 1st-world country you&rsquo;re not going to have a 1st world country anymore.
										</p>
										<p>
											People only prosper under a free society if they have the work ethic and IQ to be able to think for themselves. The vast majority of blacks and Hispanics do not. Look at New Orleans, LA, and Detroit: that is the future of America.
										</p>
										<p>
											The USA has been able to prosper in spite of its large black and Hispanic populations. This economic recession is part of the USA&rsquo;s transition into a majority Hispanic-black country. It will never recover.
										</p>
										<p>
											Ron Paul may slow the nation&rsquo;s decay, but his unwillingness to deport the blacks and Hispanics/illegal aliens may spell the end of the United States as a prosperous nation.
										</p>

											The wheels of history are rolling and it looks like its too late to change their direction.

											There is a very very thin veneer of civility that &#8220;glues&#8221; together &#8220;American&#8221; society. This very very thin veneer of civility was briefly blown of for the one month affter 9/11. The Hindus, Sihks and Muslims in our America were terrified that their race-replacement racket was coming to a crashing end.
										</p>
										<p>
											If John McCain had won on Nov 4 2008, blacks would have gone on a murdering and raping spree of Whites. No doubt about it..the threat was in the air. If this had happened, there would have been a violent race-war in America. One of the consequences of this is that it would have set into motion the end of post-1965 immigration policy. The degenerate Liberal Greedy Cheating Class has been living on borrowed time. They have been incredibly lucky. The have no special skills or insights that would prevent &#8220;American&#8221; society from becoming completely unglued&hellip;just pure luck. Everyone here should prepare themselves for the collapse of &#8220;American&#8221; society. It won&rsquo;t be pretty. It will happen when you least expect.
										</p>
										<p>
											A tactical nuclear attack on Iran is going to play a major role in the collapse of &#8220;American&#8221; society. When this happens there will be only two possibilities: 1) nuclear WW3 or America..and the rest of the human species will have dodged a bullet. If we manage to avoid nuclear WW3, the only option left for Native Born White America is 1) handing Hilary Clinton over to the Hague to stand trial or war crimes and 2) a complete end to US occupation of the World-invade the world. Once this happens, it will be the end of blessings of diversity policy that is the &#8220;humane&#8221; ideological shroud on a evil political-economic system. It will be the end of post-1965 immigration policy which works hand-in-hand with the treasonous and criminal Military Industrial Complex of the DC Republican-Democratic power structure. &#8220;America&#8221; will implode with the arrival of thousands of unemployed young White Males who are no longer serving over seas. This is the kind of stuff that Pat Buchanan should have written about in his new book..instead we get boring Sailer-Brimelow policy wonk garbage&hellip;a complete flop.

											Mr. &#038; Mrs. Gated Community, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the &#8220;anybody but Obama&#8221; crowd are united behind Gingrich. Articles on his anti-white pro-illegal stance such as this one might solidify the Mexican vote. With deep-pocket pukes salivating over more cheap labor profits and the backing of rabid &#8220;we control the vote&#8221; Mexicans, Gingrich just might pull it off. Since the drool cup wearing ignorant masses have chosen to bypass Michele Bachmann, the only true conservative in the line up, they will help put Mexicans in control. Mexican-sucking has become a national pastime (George W. Filth, John McStain, Rick Perryez, Newt Ganggreen) and that should be the canary in the coal mine that tells Americans that Mexico is well on the way to influencing/controlling the U.S. electorate. Mexicans were the catalysts that re-elected Harry &#8220;I&rsquo;ll give you amnesty&#8221; Reid in Nevada, and Raul &#8220;boycott my state&#8221; Grijalva in Arizona, but the droolers refuse to acknowledge it. The zillion anchor babies delivered by George W. Filth will start turning 18 in 2018, so the projection is that by the 2020 election, the game will be over. There&rsquo;s a Tequila Party in your future. This is what the ignorant masses in America will leave to their children and grandchildren, out of greed, stupidity, and indifference.

											Ron Paul definitely gets my vote. He&rsquo;s a freedom fighter and has a magical quality of not coming across as a politician. He&rsquo;s genuine and has integrity. He wants absolute life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He will bring this country back to life.
										</p>
										<p>
											He wants to end the Federal Reserve, and bring the control of money back into the AMERICANS hands.
										</p>
										<p>
											He wants to lower taxes, and COMPLETELY abolish the IRS and income tax, which accounts for about 2-3 months of your labor.
										</p>
										<p>
											He wants to bring our troops back home, and put them around OUR borders to protect us, rather than invade every country we can and oppress the people of other nations.
										</p>
										<p>
											He wants to legalize marijuana, gay marriage, etc &mdash; He doesn&rsquo;t legalize these things out of personal preference.. He wants to legalize them because this is supposed to be a FREE nation, with FREE choices. No government has the right to tell us what we can, and can not put into OUR bodies, or how we can live OUR lives.
										</p>
										<p>
											He wants to stop the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from interfering with Americans&rsquo; knowledge of and access to dietary supplements and alternative treatments.
										</p>
										<p>
											He supports homeschooling, and will help to make it a more accepted and widespread (this is a major plus for those that understand how terrible our nations&rsquo; education system has become) form of education.
										</p>
										<p>
											He will look into alternative energy choices.. This means we can eventually stray away from the use of oil, and focus on energy sources from the sun, water, wind, and biofuels, making energy cheaper, and majorly reducing our negative impact on our environment.
										</p>
										<p>
											He wants to legalize the Second Amendment (our right to bear arms [own guns]), which politicians have been trying to make illegal for a long time now. Look up statistics of American states that allow concealed carry of firearms, and see how much lower state crime is compared to states who make firearm ownership illegal. The fact is, if someone plans to rob/murder you, they will think twice if there&rsquo;s a chance of you adequately defending yourself. Also, the criminals who commit crimes in the first place will find a way to ILLEGALLY get a gun if they need to, while the honest, innocent American citizen remains defenseless.
										</p>
										<p>
											Overall, he&rsquo;s about FREEDOM. For those stuck in the republican/democrat, liberal/conservatism, one vs the other mindset - please leave that behind for a moment and focus on what this guy truly stands for - your personal rights as a human being.
										</p>
										<p>
											He has never voted on a tax raise.
										</p>
										<p>
											There&rsquo;s a reason the mainstream media ignores him. It&rsquo;s because he won&rsquo;t buy into their game. He won&rsquo;t be one of their puppets that they can throw a few dollars at to push their agenda. He&rsquo;s for the constitution. He&rsquo;s for America.

											The titanic comparison is valid, but if you must vote then Romney&rsquo;s the best choice out of plenty of bad choices. Gingrich is a disaster. Or do you pull the lever for him based on his naked pandering vis-a-vi Israel/Palestine?
										</p>
										<p>

											#35 - Dave C
										</p>
										<p>
											Gingrich is an excellent demagogue and sounds really radical when he usually isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s a total flip-flopper on enormous amounts of issues, ranging from the mentioned above to cap and trade, health care etc etc etc.
										</p>
										<p>
											Mitt is much more steady (or boring/bland if you will) but I still think he will be able to stem the flow more efficiently than other candidates, including Gingrich or Paul.
										</p>
										<p>
											Nonetheless, Mitt will not deport anybody as he has stated. He wants them to &#8216;go back to the line&rsquo; but they won&rsquo;t have to leave the country to do that.
										</p>
										<p>
											The best you can do now is basically a big fence and turning off the magnets. Amnesty will come, but it will be creeping. Mitt&rsquo;s very sensitive to what the base says. In this way he can be pushed much easier than Gingrich, who has basically zero understanding for the base and openly supports Affirmative Racism and many other issues.
										</p>
										<p>
											As for the &#8216;situation&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve often written here that for me everyone beyond 2020 is unimportant. America will continue to be majority white for as long as it will matter, which is roughly the next 10 years.
										</p>
										<p>
											In 2020, Peak Oil will either have hit so badly that people will be forced to go tribal. Or, nanotechnology will have progressed so much - and together with it, the genetic revolution that will make the race gap a total non-issue - that race as a concept will have no meaning anymore.
										</p>
										<p>
											Granted, problems will still exists. But they will be of a more universal character, megacorporations getting all the patents and using it for themselves, the possibility of instant destruction by use of nanotechnology but controlled essentially by &#8216;intelligent&rsquo; apes with still very, very primal instincts.
										</p>
										<p>
											If the genome/robotics/AI/nanotechnology revolution continues to pick up speed to 2020 in the way that many scientists believe, then existential questions like &#8216;what does it mean to be human&rsquo; will become important instead.
										</p>
										<p>
											This is a long topic, but the world in even 20 years, in 2030 will be so radically different than from what we&rsquo;ve become used to. We will either have civilizational collapse and then an uncertain direction but from a totally new era or we&rsquo;ll have civilizational progress to such an extent that it threatens the very definition of what it means to be human and calls into question our very assumptions of intelligent life and how it will continue.
										</p>
										<p>
											Either way, in 2020 we&rsquo;ll know which way will win.
										</p>
										<p>
											The point in the next decade is to place yourself in such a way so you and the people you care for will be placed safely. It&rsquo;s way too late for political activism now. Watch the entire world change, because it will, the only question will be if it will be done by our old, tribal instincts or scientific transcendence.

											Ron Paul want to end the subsidies for illegals that bring them here in the first place. The requirements that states provide them with medical care, education etc. If these are denied and our economy allowed to recover from these so-call &#8220;Free-Trade agreements&#8221;, most of the illegals will self-deport. Further, he want an end to birth right citizenship. I don&rsquo;t want to have my name not be on a list maintained by some idiot government bureaucrat to switch jobs. They are total screw ups mostly made up of AA sludgs.

											I look at Bachmann and others who get high marks from numbers USA and I note they they are all for us getting involved in foreign wars. And what happens after these wars? We IMPORT more refugees - Somalians, Afghans, Bosnians, Iraqis, Vietnamese, Cambodians etc. Is THAT what you want?
										</p>

											Okay, I&rsquo;ll bite.
										</p>
										<p>
											I started out this season for Michele Bachmann, because of her decent immigration record, relative to the competition. I switched to Ron Paul when: (A) Bachmann made it obvious she was in it to bird dog for Romney, and (B) Ron Paul met with Marine Le Pen. But I&rsquo;m voting for Ron Paul with eyes wide open, knowing all his foibles. I could be swung back to Bachmann, if and only if I could be convinced that she&rsquo;s serious about winning in her own right. I doubt that she is, though.
										</p>
										<p>
											Now that the Pizza Jockey is out, I&rsquo;ll vote for whoever comes out of this process over Obama, because I don&rsquo;t want a black President. Again, I&rsquo;ll do it with eyes wide open, fully recognizing that the Republican nominee, whoever it is, will have imperfections and foibles aplenty, and beyond that, will have any number of blatantly wrong-headed positions.
										</p>
										<p>
											I gave up the delusion of &#8220;white horse savior&#8221; politicians a long time ago. Politics are arts of the possible.
										</p>
										<p>
											As an aside, I&rsquo;m seeing the meme among the comments in this story that we can end illegal immigration simply by eliminating the benefit magnets. I used to think that, but AR regulars have convinced me that it&rsquo;s wishful thinking. Life in the third world sucks so badly that most of the third world would rather live as a homeless American or an imprisoned American than a free citizen of their country of birth.

											Girlish has this infantile belief system that if Ron Paul was ellected, &#8220;America&#8221; would become a Libertarian paradise&hellip;But exactly for who? In the past year, Ron Paul has expressed-covered on vdare.com-very intense hostility toward the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;he basically called them a bunch of lazy parasites who deserved to race-replaced by Asians, Muslims, Hispanics, Caribbeans and Africans. Paul, a H-1 B and L-1 B fanatic would aid and abet the Asian invaders agenda of destroying centuries of Native Born White American Engineering, Medical and Scientific expertise..this is what you call genocide!!! Ron Paul&rsquo;s presidency-if it was a Libertarian paradise-would be one with a very small, and highly persecuted Native Born White minority surrounded by a high fertility,rapidly expanding,heavily armed, and hostile non white Majority&hellip;this is Ron Paul&rsquo;s &#8220;America&#8221;.
										</p>
										<p>
											Every &#8220;US&#8221; President is a Dear Leader for some group within the borders of America. For White Americans, &#8220;vote for my Dear Leader&#8221; is just a lazy way to be political..at at time when the rot is so very very deep in America. What happens locally is what matters the most..and this requires a very very high level of political,social and cultural vigilance&hellip;and the new local order- local interactions-will create a long-range political order favorable to a long term existing-thriving Native Born White American Majority.
										</p>
										<p>
											The starting point for the reclamation of lost Native Born White American living space starts with recognizing that anyone who aspires to be President of the United States is a sociopath..and this includes Ron Paul who has enormous..vaulting..sociopathic intent towards his fellow Native Born White Americans who created along with their ancestors a White Nation that allowed Ron Paul to thrive..and he wants to destroy this Native Born White American Nation..let my post sink into your head girlish and other Ron Paul worshippers.

											Newt has a pretty sharp mind, knows politics, history and this country well. But I don&rsquo;t think he listens to anybody. Remember what happened to his campaign staff? They quit! And we were never told why. Mitt Romney was musing as to why he can&rsquo;t take a commanding lead. Rush Limbaugh had the perfect advice for him-move to the RIGHT of every GOP candidate. Now that would be a novel approach and I definitely believe the most out-spoken conservative will win the nomination. BHO must be defeated even if it&rsquo;s not by your favorite man or woman.

											The reality is that Ron Paul HAS NOT BEEN ON OUR SIDE on immigration. Ron Paul has promoted insane, treasonous policies on immigration for a very long time. And the source of this immigration insanity/treason isn&rsquo;t hard to understand.

											Check out this 1988 audio of Ron Paul trying to convince an extremely angry White California voter that the mass Mexican Mestizo immigration/invasion in to the United States is a GOOD THING; Ron Paul doesn&rsquo;t see any difference between tens of millions of Mestizo Mexicans coming in and out (mostly in) across the US Southern border and White English speaking Canadians going back and forth across our Northern border.

											This is my first visit to A.R. but after spending three hours reading a range of intelligent and informed articles and posts I intend to be back on a daily basis. Trainspotter made a critical observation by saying that we must identify our message&rsquo;s target markets, ensure that people who might simply stay home on election day GET that message and cast their votes, and drive this dangerous Marxist out of the Oval Office. Let&rsquo;s not waste precious time trying to recruit the unrecruitable or support an independent who would divide conservatives, thereby guaranteeing four more years of Obama. I honestly don&rsquo;t think our country can survive that. I&rsquo;m not enthusiastic about any of the potential Republican nominees and would love to see just one of them speak the truth without fear of offending one group or the other. Regardless, I believe that we have to unwaveringly support the eventual Obama opponent because the consequences of a Republican loss in 2012 is horrifying.

											If you think the GOP is going to be a white party in this election or any time soon, keep dreaming. Many of them won&rsquo;t stand up to blacks, calling for deporting illegals and many of them preach the white guilt, neocon talk. They are as bad as the Democrats, except the Democrats are at least open in telling us what they think of Christian conservative white heterosexual men.

											Ron Paul is worse on immigration than anyone knows. Sure, he is against anchor babies, but that is about his only helpful position on immigration. He is terrible on passing E verify, even though it is one of the least costly in time and money than ANY federal regulatory burden placed on small business. He has NEVER come out and said he is against another amnesty. He also always uses the straw man argument of we can&rsquo;t deport millions if illegals, when nearly everyone I know on our side of the argument is simply pleading and begging for enforcement of our immigration laws and they will self deport.
										</p>
										<p>
											Finally, he has been in Texas politics for years. I am reading Ricardo Charles new book, Mexican Cliques in Texas Construction, where he risks his life to document how in Texas there are just about no native born whites or blacks in construction, and the Hispanics working in the trades must pay millions in bribes to crooked contractors to get and keep jobs. This story gets no play in the media but is well known in Texas, where has Paul been on this story? As a Texas politician in love with the Constitution, why is he not defending American workers in Texas that are driven out of industries by nepotism, cronyism, and old fashioned racketeering. This evil is spreading fast to other states and industries by the way.
										</p>
										<p>
											Demographers reported last year it is all over for whites in Texas now via Hispanic birthrates, where has Ron Paul been on this?
										</p>
										<p>
											How would he be any better as president of all 50 states?

											Way back when Newt was Speaker of the House, I was with a group of two dozen immigration reform activists who visited his office.
										</p>
										<p>
											The group I was with was trying to distribute information to politicians to get them to consider the future impact of both mass immigration and illegal immigration. The group&rsquo;s members never met any actual politicians (the whores we elect were terrified of these issues even more so back then), and we only managed to speak to staffers. Mr. Gingrich&rsquo;s staffer asked if any of us were residents in his District. When she got a &#8220;No&#8221; answer, we were quickly told she had other appointments and we would need to vacate his office&rsquo;s foyer. Didn&rsquo;t matter that he was the Speaker of the House for an entity representing the entire country; we got the bum&rsquo;s rush.
										</p>
										<p>
											At this stage in America&rsquo;s history, all of the odds are still against us. Even so, I have an elderly neighbor who yanks down bulletin board fliers that aren&rsquo;t written in English, and turns non-English magazines in the supermarket so their backs are facing the shoppers in the checkout lines. I asked her what she hoped to accomplish with such actions. She said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s the best I can do and it&rsquo;s better than nothing.&#8221; That&rsquo;s what we need: sparks of resistance, a sentiment of noncooperation, rebellion.

											Jupiter: &#8220;I realize that you are very depressed these days. The best way to deal with it is to fight back. You provide some of the highest quality commentary on the Native Born White Patriot websites..don&rsquo;t quite on us now.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											I appreciate the compliment, and I return it. I want to be clear that I don&rsquo;t view my evolving position as giving up, but simply focusing on something that is more attainable. I certainly hope my position doesn&rsquo;t have the effect of depressing or discouraging others. If enough of us could get behind a white homeland, that should be an exciting and positive thing. It too, could fire the imagination.
										</p>
										<p>
											We both agree that the current system is unsustainable. It will fail, because it must.
										</p>
										<p>
											It is highly likely that, as this unsustainable system strains and breaks, there will be myriad opportunities to move things in our direction. The million dollar question then becomes whether that will take the form of the system breaking apart in a balkanization/secession scenario, or instead if the system technically holds it together, but is forced to start behaving somewhat sanely either because of public pressure/threats or simply because it is so broke that it cannot afford to engage in as much madness as it does today.
										</p>
										<p>
											This is oversimplified, of course, and there are other possibilities as well. But I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that the fundamental issue is between balkanization/secession and the U.S remaining intact.
										</p>
										<p>
											Then there is the issue of just how much of a purist one is. I confess to being very much a purist, and I believe that what we need is a truly white nation, founded and operated upon principles designed specifically to assure our survival as a people, as well as our cultural and evolutionary development. A true nation, in the deepest sense. Anything else is at best just buying time, not the solution itself.
										</p>
										<p>
											Nothing wrong with buying time, so for example I&rsquo;m all for immigration restriction. But in a country where a majority of babies born are already non-white, it&rsquo;s simply not a solution. We need something far, far better than that. Even if non-white immigration were entirely cut off today, our demographic situation would be awful.
										</p>
										<p>
											Realistically, the only way you are going to get a true ethnostate is by starting smaller. It is likely that such an ethnostate will be able to expand in the future, for the simple reason that a true white nation is going to have incredible advantages over other areas still mired in third world demographics. Who knows, future white generations might even uphold Manifest Destiny again, but this time from a different direction, maybe West to East, or South to North.
										</p>
										<p>
											We have paid in blood for this continent, and turned it from a wilderness into a civilization. In principle, I have no problem whatsoever laying claim to all of it, but as a practical matter I don&rsquo;t think it can start out that way.
										</p>
										<p>
											Also keep in mind that, in a balkanization/secession scenario, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the case that only one white ethnostate will emerge. There may in time be several, and a confederation could emerge from that.
										</p>
										<p>
											I realize this is indulging in fantasy to the point of being silly, but it&rsquo;s important to point out that just because we start small doesn&rsquo;t mean we stay small. But we need to start somewhere, maybe several somewheres, and to at least entertain the notion that we probably aren&rsquo;t going to be able to grab the entire pie right off the bat. Again, that&rsquo;s just not going to happen in a nation where a majority of children born this year will be non-white, with more non-white children of all ages pouring in year after year.
										</p>
										<p>
											My intent is not to discourage, but rather to encourage people to recognize that there is more than one way to skin a cat. No matter how bad things get in this country, our cause is just and there are a variety of means by which it may come to fruition.
										</p>

											Having said all of that, while my thinking on this matter is clearly evolving, it is not entirely made up. In your commentary here and elsewhere, you&rsquo;ve made excellent points, and I take them seriously. But I do think that we need to start thinking outside of the box.

											Jupiter: &#8220;I would never vote for Ron Paul.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											I&rsquo;ve voted for him in the past, not sure what I will do this time. But if I vote for him, it will not be under the delusion that he is &#8220;the answer&#8221; for us, because he obviously is not. While it&rsquo;s true that many of his positions would have the effect of helping us, it is also true that his materialistic &#8220;dollars trump race&#8221; attitude is something that is at the heart of our troubles. He&rsquo;s a mixed blessing at best, perhaps worth a vote (if that), but certainly not worth a financial contribution. Anyone who feels like parting with some loose change in their pocket should send it instead toward any number of good, pro-white websites. Perhaps the one you&rsquo;re reading now.

											Jupiter: &#8220;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the Republicans and Democrats can go ahead and start a nuclear WW3 in the Middle East&hellip;I will never vote for Ron Paul..he war mongers against the Native Born White American Majority.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											It&rsquo;s a good point, but in the world of libertarian race blindness, it&rsquo;s a point that does not compute - another reason to have a nation founded explicitly upon race, upon a particular people. Proposition nations indulge in nutty and kooky actions, all in slavery to their ridiculous dogma. Modern libertarianism is Exhibit A, as they have now completely detached liberty from reality (and race). They would let the entire world burn in slavish devotion to their sacred texts. They have no problem turning a white nation into a third world hellhole, so long as they believe that Mises or Rand would have approved. Again, any value outside of their narrow dogma simply does not compute with them. You might as well be a visitor from Mars, as far as they are concerned.
										</p>
										<p>
											Jupiter: &#8220;The White Homeland stuff is a whole lot of nonsense..a White Homeland means being surrounded by China, India, Pakistan, Korea and Iran.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											I share your concerns about what will happen in an international power vacuum. But you have to consider that, as America declines, this is likely to happen in some form anyway. Really, it&rsquo;s already happening.
										</p>
										<p>
											It&rsquo;s not just Hispanics that are swamping us, as you know. Asians are essentially colonizing the West Coast in a big way, from Hong Couver (Vancouver) on down. Once the Chinese have developed a true blue water navy&hellip;well, let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s not comforting. But it&rsquo;s happening. A declining America is demonstrating neither the ability nor the appetite to reverse this process. Instead it just goes to China begging for another loan.
										</p>
										<p>
											At this point, it is highly likely that China is going to get its hooks into this continent (in some ways, it already has). It may well take a true white ethnostate, or confederation of the same, to eventually dislodge it. We&rsquo;ll see, but the point is that for the time being, the Chinese star is rising - all of this with America currently intact.
										</p>
										<p>
											It should also be considered that balkanization in some form may be forced upon us, whether we are ready or not. However it plays out, let&rsquo;s hope we can make the most of it. I suppose my main point is that it is entirely possible that the wave we ultimately catch will not be as most imagined it. But a wave we will catch, one way or another. And if we truly can recover America per se, no one will be happier than me. I&rsquo;d be happy to eat crow on this one, and after that, first round is on me. But I also think it wise to consider other possibilities.

Stop it already! You&rsquo;re playing into their hands! I&rsquo;m not too happy about the choices either, I wish there was a more conservative choice, but there&rsquo;s not going to be one! We have all got to unite behind the one that is chosen, we&rsquo;ve got no choice this time. If you remember noting else remember this one fact - whoever gets the next four years will probably get to seat at least two Supreme Court Justices, do you want Obama in charge of that? My hope is that we can increase our majority in the House and also take the Senate with conservatives, they in turn could &#8220;sway&#8221; a not-so-conservative Rep. President. We have got a lot of work ahead of us to get this done, lets not get distracted fighting each other instead of Obama, that is what &#8220;they&#8221; want. Lets keep our eyes focused on the prize.

											Immigration: In Dr. Paul&rsquo;s own words:
										</p>
										<p>
											&#8220;Immigration reform should start with improving our border protection, yet it was reported last week that the federal government has approved the recruitment of 120 of our best trained Border Patrol agents to go to Iraq to train Iraqis how to better defend their borders! This comes at a time when the National Guard troops participating in Operation Jump Start are being removed from border protection duties in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas and preparing to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan! It is an outrage and it will result in our borders being more vulnerable to illegal entry, including by terrorists.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											In short, Dr. Paul&rsquo;s plan is to secure the border, end amnesty, abolish welfare to illegal immigrants, end birthright citizenship and protect lawful immigrants.

											People like you are what really makes &#8216;the situation&rsquo; impossible to solve. You think this is a one party issue. Romney or Gingrich won&rsquo;t solve anything - and Gingrich especially will most likely do much worse than Obama because Obama, at least on some level, needs to pander to working class whites in a way Gingrich doesn&rsquo;t have to.
										</p>
										<p>
											Granted, many people take a cynical stand and think it&rsquo;s pointless to vote. Politicians are by nature reactionary and they are almost always part of the problem.
										</p>
										<p>
											The myth of the &#8216;leader to solve all our problems&rsquo; is a huge issue, because people don&rsquo;t want to take matters into their own hands. As someone quipped: if voting was so efficient it would be illegal.
										</p>
										<p>
											That&rsquo;s a bit too cynical for my taste, but there is some truth to it. One can take a reseigned stance like Hirch, #7, but even if he plans to vote for Gingrich he still admits that it&rsquo;s like re-arranging the deck chairs on Titanic. He&rsquo;s at least clear eyed about the situation. You, on the other hand, is frankly so brainwashed you think this is somehow an issue of Obama.
										</p>
										<p>
											It&rsquo;s sad to see people suppesedly &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; to fall for the claptrap of Republican vs Democrat when neither party has done anything.
										</p>
										<p>
											The best thing to do is actually pushing for a third, fourth and fifth party in politics. Studies have shown that you only need about 10 % of the vote in a parliament to start getting traction for your ideas. And outside of politics, work in the media. Media is much more important than individual leaders. Media sets the frame. If you are not happy with what&rsquo;s at stake, create your own.
										</p>
										<p>
											But whatever you do, rid yourself of all illusions by pinning all this on Obama and selling yourself so catastrophically cheap as to think that the issue is somehow him when this article clearly states that Gingrich is at least, and most likely worse, as bad as he is.
										</p>
										<p>
											This isn&rsquo;t a party issue. It&rsquo;s a cultural phenomenon.
										</p>
										<p>
											Even if someone has given up hope, we at least have an obligation to be true to ourselves and view the world as it is and not fall for puppet candidates that tell us what we want to hear. Look at Gingrich&rsquo;s record or for that matter, Mitt Romney&rsquo;s. The only reason I think Romney is the best out of the many bad choices is because his standing in the base is weak and he is prone to pandering. He is afraid of the anti-immigration meme and he has shown he is willing to adjust. Gingrich, on the other hand, frankly does not care. And he has been praised by the NYT for &#8216;staring down the base&rsquo; and taking a &#8216;humane&rsquo; immigration stance.
										</p>
										<p>
											If NYT praises your immigration stance and you have a history of naked hostility to your white base, why would you vote for him?
										</p>
										<p>
											If you must vote at all.

											Check out this 1988 audio of Ron Paul trying to convince an extremely angry White California voter that the mass Mexican Mestizo immigration/invasion in to the United States is a GOOD THING; Ron Paul doesn&rsquo;t see any difference between tens of millions of Mestizo Mexicans coming in and out (mostly in) across the US Southern border and White English speaking Canadians going back and forth across our Northern border.

											Wake up, White man and White woman. History CLEARLY shows that in literally EVERY SINGLE SITUATION where Whites have allowed themselves to become a minority inside lands that they formerly controlled and dominated - subjugated to being ruled by non-whites, those non-white races have foisted the horrors of mass rape, terrorism, gruesome mutilations and dismemberment, and have gleefully engaged in ethnic cleansing in the form of mass murder. These are historical facts that cannot be denied or glossed over, people. If Ron Paul is unable to study history and absorb these sobering truths into his brain and then adjust his positions on massive third world, non-white invasions of historic White European nations - then the guy is either senile or a complete moron.

											Their stance on open borders ignores common sense. If you bring a bunch of 3rd-world people into a 1st-world country you&rsquo;re not going to have a 1st world country anymore.

											Dave C can stand up and take a bow. Excellent summation of the Libertarian party insanity and what that insanity would result in, i.e., the complete and total destruction of White Western Civilization. This entire immigration argument boils down to the Franz Boas, Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism driven poison of denying the realities of race.

											America, as a contiguous nation - is gone, finished. Stick a fork in it. It&rsquo;s time for a White Ethnostate to become the #1 objective of every racially awake, White race realist - and in that new exclusively White Ethnostate - Cultural Marxism and race denial will become capital punishment offenses.

											Here is where think we differ. What you wrote is clearly an accurate description of reality..though with some important counter-trends left out. The crucial difference between our points of view comes down to this:Are our fellow Native Born White Americans going through a cognitive dissonance stage and 2)when they transition out of the cognitive dissonance stage, how will they react to being massively decieved? I believe that when our fellow Native Born White Americans transition out of the cognitive dissonace stage, they wll emerge highly enraged. There is very strong scientific evidence for this. Sociobiologist and Harvard professor Trivers has a new book about this..go google the Chomsky-Trivers conservation for a good overview about this point.
										</p>
										<p>
											The good news is that there is a well developed Native Born American Patriot Alternative Media in place that millions of Native Born White Americans can tap into&hellip;AR,vdare.com,Occiental Observer,Alternative Right,Mangans,Poltical Cesspoll and Majority Rights.
										</p>
										<p>
											Pat Buchanan could have greatly accelerated this transition if he had 1)pulled no punches in his new book;2)expressed great enthusiasm for the Chinese Exclusion Act;3)called for a policy of 0 nonwhite legal immigration permanently..none this amnesty nonesense ;40 asked his fellow Native Born White Americans what they are willing to give up for racial minority status within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;&hellip;giving up wonderfull amenities such as family vacations in the Adirondacks,Yellowstone and Cherokee National-State Parks..and gave enormous evidence that the Asians in America are a mighty serious threat to America&rsquo;s wildlife and ecosystems. Pat, of course, used Sailer and Brimelow for expert advice..and as consequene Pats&rsquo;s new book fell into oblivion. Playing it policy wonk safe means being consigned to oblivion.
										</p>
										<p>
											Last point:some people here are in complete denial about just how awfull Ron Paul is on immigration&hellip;complete denial. Moreover, Ron Paul&rsquo;s extreme privatization programs-policy have already been rejected by millions of Native Born White Americans. If anything is obvious about Ron Paul it is this:he harbors extremely malignant intent towards Native Born White Americans..and if he were elected POTUS, he would use the power of the state to enforce his race-replacement-nonwhite scab labor fantasies upon millions of Native Born White American families. Ron Paul&rsquo;s immigration and economic policies will with 100 percent certainty cause the mass economic dispossesion of the generation of young White Males comming up now-7-21 age group..this will cause a massive collapse of the Native Born White American population.

											Agreed. We all need to understand the past is history - there isn&rsquo;t any way some nice, polite, sincere old Libertarian/Constitutionalist President will somehow be allowed to turn back the clock and make America like it was in 1861 or even 1951. And don&rsquo;t go wasting all of your time trying to get the world to agree that a fair interpretation of the US Constitution will make everything all right. The lower caste non Whites of the 3rd world now in our 1st world countries don&rsquo;t much care for White man&rsquo;s laws, White man&rsquo;s Constitutions. Rhodesia-Zimbabwe supposedly had a good Constitution, protected White farm owner&rsquo;s property rights&hellip;. a lot of good this did to them. The Robert Mugabes of the world (or Marion Barrys, Coleman Youngs, Jessie Jacksons, NAACP, LARAZA or the various non White street gangs/criminals) are not fair and honorable people who will honor their agreements/our Constitutions. That&rsquo;s life. Get used to it and learn to compete, win in this new world.

											Within libertarian thought there is no single stance regarding race and immigration. Von Mises and Rothbard were both race realists although this isn&rsquo;t widely known. These days Lew Rockwell and the Mises Institute avoid the issue of race. Hard to believe that Lew Rockwell used to run columns by Jared Taylor back in the 1990s before Lew excommunicated Jared and scrubbed his site of Jared&rsquo;s columns. Libertarian scholar Walter Block is an advocate of open border while libertarian scholar Hans Hermann-Hoppe articulates the case for a restrictionist immigration policy.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have voted for Ron Paul in the past but I might not this time since his position on federal immigration policy is terrible. The best that can be said for him is that he would not direct the Justice Department to sue states which choose to enact restrictive policies against illegal aliens. I am inclined to think that if we lose the immigration battle, then we&rsquo;ve lost the war.
										</p>
										<p>
											I&rsquo;m pessimistic and more and more apt to believe that the answer simply will not be found in the ballot box. The fedgov spends $10 billion per day but brings in only $6 billion in revenue. In order to survive it must resort to borrowing the other $4 billion and having its Federal Reserve electronically print the money. Is this sustainable over the long run? I don&rsquo;t think so. The long-term viability of the United States of America is in jeopardy.
										</p>
										<p>
											So what is to be done? My long-term goal is to live in a white ethno-state that respects property rights, privacy, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and self-defense, and that enjoys the benefits and stability of hard money. The immigration policy will be one which invites white people the world over to relocate to the future country which I call Whitelandia. I&rsquo;d like a chance to vote in a race where Jupiter7 and Transpotter are on the ballot.

											Jupiter: &#8220;Every &ldquo;US&rdquo; President is a Dear Leader for some group within the borders of America. For White Americans, &ldquo;vote for my Dear Leader&rdquo; is just a lazy way to be political..at at time when the rot is so very very deep in America. What happens locally is what matters the most..and this requires a very very high level of political,social and cultural vigilance&hellip;and the new local order- local interactions-will create a long-range political order favorable to a long term existing-thriving Native Born White American Majority&#8221;

											Thanks again for being the voice of reason. The problem can only be solved from the bottom-up. The US won&rsquo;t be reclaimed by the perfect president issuing a deus ex machina proclimation returning the republic to a 1950s era mindset. Anyone insane enough to think he can solve America&rsquo;s problems while president (as all seem to think they can) shouldn&rsquo;t have the position. George Washington was the first (and possibly last) president who was humble enough to deserve the position (because he didn&rsquo;t particularly want it), an irony because today we have candidates who think they can literally lower the seas and change human nature to make the US a unified nation despite its growing diversity and ethnic differences.

											Does anyone else think that perhaps the best course would be for Obama to win again?
										</p>
										<p>
											I believe that an economic crisis much more severe than the one in 2008 is coming. I believe that our government will be forced to deal with our debt problem by either radically cutting defense, cutting entitlements, imposing exorbitant taxes on the rich, or defaulting on our bonds. Whoever is in office will be forced to do these things and will also get the blame. Wouldn&rsquo;t be better if a black democrat were in office when this happens?

They will do literally nothing to stop coming train wreck of our country? Why not let the train wreck happen on a black democrats watch; he will cause the collapse to happen sooner, which will give us a fighting chance to win over the minds of our fellow whites?

											The issue with Ron Paul is that he means what he says. All other Republican candidates have given lip service to the Republican agenda but their real masters have already set their agenda for them and it&rsquo;s exactly the same as what Obama is doing now (which is exactly the same as Bush did before him).
										</p>
										<p>
											Ron Paul will not round up tens of millions of Mexicans and force them out of this country, much less put them to the sword as they should be.
										</p>
										<p>
											But he will cut off their welfare and move our military from the Middle East to the southern border. The criminal element will find it incredibly difficult to move materials and slaves back and forth to the US. And without welfare dollars, most of the drug trade will dry up&hellip;.removing the reason the majority of Mexicans are in the US. A tidy side benefit will be it will become very uncomfortable to be a black welfare queen. Yes, the liberals will howl but the bottom line is blacks who currently live a 6 figure income off our welfare dollars will be returned to a bare subsistence living under someone like Ron Paul.
										</p>
										<p>
											So which would you prefer? Another neocon who tells you comfortable lies and then commits genocide against you and your family? Or Ron Paul who will weaken and destroy the welfare/warfare state, vastly improving conditions for whites and possibly setting the stage to wage the coming open race war from a position of strength.
										</p>
										<p>
											The time is not yet when we can demand our government deport non-whites from our lands. That is more likely to start in Europe, then here. But we can improve our position with someone like Ron Paul and force the invading immigrants to do what they absolutely don&rsquo;t want to do&hellip;.support themselves.

											It looks like Gingrich is going to be the G.O.P. candidate, mainly because many white Evangelical Christians just won&rsquo;t support a Mormon, no matter how qualified he or she is.
										</p>
										<p>
											I personally think Gingrich is bad on a number of issues, particularly on the Mideast and immigration, but I still think it&rsquo;s very important to have a President who will appoint an Attorney General who is at least more sympathetic to the interests of whites, something that definitely is not the case with Holder. The Justice Department can do an awful lot of harm, as has been seen over these past few years as it butts its nose into cases involving states trying to deal with the illegal immigration onslaught such as Arizona and Alabama.
										</p>
										<p>
											Also, the important third branch of government, the Supreme Court, needs at least appointees who are not like Sotamayor, and Gingrich is likely to appoint a strict constructionist to the bench if an appointment opens up. Hopefully such an appointee will be against affirmative action which is an important issue.
										</p>
										<p>
											In short, since all is relative in politics, Gingrich should be voted for by Race Realists when he is nominated as the Republican candidate.

											Yep, Gingrich is a stellar racial panderer. He truly is the most anti-White of the lot.

											Interestingly, Newt (and other GOPers) seem more willing to fight for Israeli sovereignty than white American sovereignty.
										</p>
										<p>
											Newt forcefully and unapologetically dismantled the logic and historical revisionism that &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; have a claim to Jewish lands during this past debate. However, what does he say with regard to immigration? Does he bring up the fact that Mexicans don&rsquo;t have a right to come to the United States? Does he argue that it is in the US&rsquo;s best interest to maintain English as the de facto language or traditional (white) Americans as the dominant ethnicity?
										</p>
										<p>
											Interestingly, Newt understand that an Israel that allows Muslim Arabs to replace its Jewish population will cease to be Israel as we know it but doesn&rsquo;t get that if America replaces its populace of those of European decent with those of Asian, Hispanic, Arab, or African decent it will cease to be America as we know it.

											Gingrich has already received over $7,000,000 from Sheldon Adelson, a strong supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu and Likud, as of 2010. This doesn&rsquo;t include a recent donation of an undisclosed amount, but we can be sure it&rsquo;s very generous because Newt is definitely saying all the right things to please the neocons.

											The people who are presently in power are wild eyed ideologues who have shown us by example that they are not concerned about the &#8220;concerns&#8221; of the people who have built this society. The agenda is the driving force and they have over the last 60 years mind numbed us with distractions including material things and forms of entertainment, all of which have permitted them to erode our freedom. The PC strategy has been so effective that we&rsquo;ve come to accept the immoral, violent society in which we live to the point where it&rsquo;s just a part of our everyday lives and increasingly, our deaths. Our entertainment is overwhelmingly violent as it reflects our ever more violent society. TV serves up either a steady diet of crime related programs be they fictional or documentary or more and more crude, vulgar sitcoms like Two and a Half Men or Broke Girls The number of safe places in our society are decreasing at a seemingly exponential rate. We have a dying educational system from the K through Graduate schools and general civility is fading away due to the adoption of the &#8220;culture&#8221; of the lowest level of society and at the same time portraying the members of that society as role models to be emulated.
										</p>
										<p>
											My wife has taken to watching the Hallmark series of Christmas movies and they&rsquo;re like an oasis. Sure they have cookie cutter,&#8221;corny&#8221; (by today&rsquo;s &#8220;standards&#8221;) plots and portray places where people live moral lives, help each other in adversity and freely wish each other a &#8220;Merry CHristmas. The endings are always happy. I&rsquo;ve also become addicted to them while at the same time recognize that they&rsquo;re only a fantasy.
										</p>
										<p>
											They&rsquo;ve systematically degraded the symbols of our Judeo-Chrisitan culture and have conditioned us to &#8220;go along&#8221; down to the simple greeting of &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221;.

											#65: I believe the best argument for voting for Ron Paul is that he respects the sovereinty of the individual States to make laws that reflect their own populations&rsquo; desires, as long as those laws are Constitutional. This goes for Gay &#8220;Marriage&#8221; and the repeal of the Federal Drug laws. The individual States will then be left to decide how they want to proceed on these individual issues.
										</p>
										<p>
											This means that Ron Paul does not have to take an overactive stance on the Illegal Alien invasion, but will also stand aside and let the sovereign States, such as Arizona, and Alabama, lead the way, by having their States and local Police Officers, and Sheriffs Deputies verify the Immigration status of any individual these Officers stop during a routine traffic stop, or after the commission of a crime, to determine such Status of the subject. Currently, we have D.C. filing Law Suit after Law Suit against the States that try and defend their own people and borders.
										</p>
										<p>
											Once the status of the subject is detemined to be Illegal, Federal Immigration Agents can be dispatched to arrest and deport such person.
										</p>
										<p>
											Remember, Ron Paul wants to embrace the Constitution and respect the sovereignty of these United States, so adhering to current, yet unenforced, Federal law at the request of the sovereign States will be something that Ron Paul will have to do, since he has made this Constitutional pledge for over 30 years. This is why he was elected.

											You and everyone else need to learn lessons from California.
										</p>
										<p>
											If 0bama wins again, you can be sure the entire country WILL be massively flooded with non-White, race-replacment, democratic voters to the point where any other party will be an absolute joke (and yes, I agree that there isn&rsquo;t much hope from the GOP to stem the tide of unwashed masses from the most depraved corners of the world).

										<p>
											0bama is already in the process now of giving amnesty by executive order to ALL illegal aliens in a run up to next year&rsquo;s election.
										</p>
										<p>
											If California is any sort of example, look at the last election results, 2010: Gov. Gerry Brown won by 13 points, über-lefty Boxer by 10 points, idiot Gavin Newsom by 11 points &mdash; ALL far lefties!
										</p>
										<p>
											Brown&rsquo;s plan to rescue California? Place $7 Billion in new taxes on the November 2012 Ballot.

										<p>
											Nothing will change this, the demographics here in California are TOO far gone, Whites have been race-replaced.
										</p>
										<p>
											Result: California is the Worst Run State in the entire US.
										</p>
										<p>
											Now, imagine this writ large across the entire US, with the democrats firmly in control of ALL branches of the federal government.
										</p>
										<p>
											But, the worst and most dangerous threat of an 0bama regime victory is another lefty 0bama appointment to SCOTUS, which as it is, is hanging on by a 5-4 thread. Imagine that flipping.

											I wonder what is Ron Paul&rsquo;s opinion of the War Between The States? This in my opinion is the most important question racially-aware whites can ask the man.
										</p>
										<p>
											Here&rsquo;s an angle on Ron Paul that none of you seem to have considered: a libertarian-leaning president like Paul would be the least likely to pull a Lincoln and attempt to prevent secession through force of arms.
										</p>
										<p>
											Or in other words, if a group of people living in a particular area currently governed under the US flag decided they no longer wished to be governed by that entity, that it no longer represented their interests, a President Paul would be more likely than any widely-known politician in America today to say &#8220;go with God&#8221; instead of deploying USNORTHCOM to oppose you. This alone abrogates any criticisms of the man as a potential POTUS.
										</p>
										<p>
											A Paul presidency is the best chance you&rsquo;re going to get to realize your ethnic white homeland without having to fight the US military. This is why he is our best hope. And if you&rsquo;re worrying about withdrawal from foreign bases and E-Verify, you&rsquo;re more a part of the problem than the solution. It&rsquo;s an increasingly centralized, powerful, and omnipotent federal government that gave us civil rights legislation, affirmative action and unfettered immigration in the first place, remember?
										</p>
										<p>
											Also remember that we face a situation where this government, which currently practices what can only be called institutional racism against whites, isn&rsquo;t many decades away from presiding over a majority non-white country. Anti-white inequality is already built into the system. It&rsquo;s ripe for a non-white tyrant to seize power and use this explicitly against us rather than implicitly as it is done now.
										</p>
										<p>
											And when this tyrant decrees E-Verify will be used to check your tax records to see if you&rsquo;ve held better gainful employment in your life than a non-white competing for the same position as you, and you are passed over for reasons of &#8220;social justice,&#8221; remember that I tried to warn you all not to reward the incompetence of government with more power.

											I read a description of anarcho-tyranny today as &#8220;This strange mix of powerful censorship of public debate, yet little control over public law and order.&#8221; If you don&rsquo;t have open public debate you don&rsquo;t have democracy, you have a mock democracy and that&rsquo;s what we have in this country. The Republicans and establishment Conservatives are basically just con men whose job in this Potemkin democracy is to stifle dissent from their constituents against the System in exchange for an opportunity to service the millionaires who pay their bills. In particular their job is to stifle dissent on the racial beliefs of the cultural elite. They understand what the flooding of millions of immigrants into the country means to their party, to their alleged social and political &#8220;Conservative&#8221; beliefs, they understand what it means to the nation and Western civilization.
										</p>
										<p>
											They just don&rsquo;t care. They&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s all over and they might as well make a profit on the decline. Since they can&rsquo;t talk about the real problem they can only produce a bunch of hucksters who jump from one fad (like Enterprise Zones and the Third Wave) to another or start wars overseas to take their constituents minds off the fact that they are phonies, that they haven&rsquo;t conserved a thing, not even the people and culture, and have no intention of even trying. Always waving the flag, of course. They&rsquo;re the Crooked Party, not the Stupid Party.

											&#8220;The people who are presently in power are wild eyed ideologues who have shown us by example that they are not concerned about the &ldquo;concerns&rdquo; of the people who have built this society. The agenda is the driving force and they have over the last 60 years mind numbed us with distractions including material things and forms of entertainment, all of which have permitted them to erode our freedom. The PC strategy has been so effective that we&rsquo;ve come to accept the immoral, violent society in which we live to the point where it&rsquo;s just a part of our everyday lives and increasingly, our deaths. Our entertainment is overwhelmingly violent as it reflects our ever more violent society. TV serves up either a steady diet of crime related programs be they fictional or documentary or more and more crude, vulgar sitcoms like Two and a Half Men or Broke Girls The number of safe places in our society are decreasing at a seemingly exponential rate. We have a dying educational system from the K through Graduate schools and general civility is fading away due to the adoption of the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of the lowest level of society and at the same time portraying the members of that society as role models to be emulated.
										</p>
										<p>
											My wife has taken to watching the Hallmark series of Christmas movies and they&rsquo;re like an oasis. Sure they have cookie cutter,&rdquo;corny&rdquo; (by today&rsquo;s &ldquo;standards&rdquo;) plots and portray places where people live moral lives, help each other in adversity and freely wish each other a &ldquo;Merry CHristmas. The endings are always happy. I&rsquo;ve also become addicted to them while at the same time recognize that they&rsquo;re only a fantasy.
										</p>
										<p>
											They&rsquo;ve systematically degraded the symbols of our Judeo-Chrisitan culture and have conditioned us to &ldquo;go along&rdquo; down to the simple greeting of &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo;.&#8221;
										</p>
										<p>
											Although I agree with much of what you say, especially in the way the media has driven culture down, I would like to remind you and readers that up until all this controversy, it was also traditional for Hallmark Cards as well as banners, greetings, etc., to say &#8220;Happy Holidays,&#8221; &#8220;Season&rsquo;s Greetings,&#8221; along with many mentions of &#8220;Yuletide,&#8221; which is a remnant of pre-Christian, European religious outlooks and practices. &#8220;Deck the Hall with Boughs of Holly,&#8221; refers to the symbolic use of holly vines, and their red berries, which signed hope for a new year of growth and abundance in the face of icy cold winter. The mistletoe represented the male semen that remained in the oak trees all winter, so kissing under it was a remnant of old European fertility rites. The green of the Christmas trees and all the decorations come from this abundantly European set of traditions and practices.
										</p>
										<p>
											I grew up in the 50s and 60s and NO ONE (save perhaps some JWs) was ever threatened or had issue with this. Today, such use is considered anti-Christian, yet virtually no one seemed to think so back then. In fact historically, the openness of Europeans to the accommodation of other ideas is what allowed Christian proselytizing among them to occur in the first place.
										</p>
										<p>
											To intersect with this, I would like to suggest that readers look up the film, &#8220;Cry, The Beloved Country.&#8221; After surfing by the Sidney Poitier film by chance yesterday, I looked it up. It turns out that the book the film is based on was written in a script not unlike the King James Bible; mighty and high sounding Elizabethan English. The book sold 15 million copies worldwide in a number of languages. The readers being overwhelmingly white. The story takes place during the implementation of apartheid in SA in the late 1940s, and the young Christian, son of a well off engineer is murdered by a black criminal. The upshot is that his writings he left behind after his death cause his parents to not only forgive his son&rsquo;s murderer, but take up their son&rsquo;s work for racial justice on behalf of blacks in SA. The movie came out in 1951, and remade in 1995.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am suggesting that this issue is deeper and will continue until whites wise up regarding the &#8220;traditions&#8221; that not only just hold us back, but actively contribute to our destruction.

										<p>
											If 10% of the white American population is sufficiently race conscious to contribute a mere one dollar a day for their country&rsquo;s salvation - and, importantly, can be organised to do so - then you would have a fund big enough ($7.3 bn p.a.)to buy back your country: big enough to buy property for all white rural and suburban settlements, to support white families and businesses,to buy or influence the media, to establish all-white private schools, to fund university fellowships, to sponsor candidates for election, to establish pressure groups and so on and so forth.

											I don&rsquo;t disagree with your comments re. Christianity. I never subscribed to the &#8220;turn the other cheek theory&#8221;. It was easy for Jesus to preach this because he knew that he was coming back within three days. We mortals haven&rsquo;t that option. As for the theme of Cry The Beloved Country the plot seems very similar to what Amy Biehl&rsquo;s parents did. They even embraced the murderers where I would have blown myself and them up with a grenade. How could you forgive anyone who murdered your beautiful but tragically naive daughter?

											One who wanted to ensure Obama&rsquo;s reelection might state something very similar. We saw similar approaches in former elections. The logic is still valid that one who wants a vote to have real value will pick someone believed to have a chance of winning, whether for virtue or for stopping the other guy.

											Are you people sure the presidential candidates are elected and not selected? All this talk and wishful thinking and it does not seem to matter who is in there, The policies seem to be the same, which are not good for any white people in America although there are a lot who don,t seem to know it.. I moved to the east coast and thought i moved to a foreign country. That was when i first experienced the &#8220;joys&#8221; of multiculturism. It is pretty much over for whites game set and match.

											Ron Paul has said countless times over and over, for at least 30 years that the porous open southern border would mean problems for the USA. He has openly mocked the last three presidents for having troops overseas protecting the borders of other countries. The fact that the media has done its best to keep Ron Paul under the radar so their masters can continue to rape the country and hand over our $$$ to the internationalist banker class ought to be a clue.

											Yes, and that&rsquo;s why I wrote in my original post, the part you copied, that the GOP is not much better on this issue:
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>(and yes, I agree that there isn&rsquo;t much hope from the GOP to stem the tide of unwashed masses from the most depraved corners of the world).</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											However, there is SCOTUS to consider. Would you rather have the 0bama regime appoint the next SCOTUS member or a GOP president? As it is, SCOTUS is hanging on by a thread.
										</p>
										<p>
											If 0bama be allowed to make the next appointment, you can be sure it will be a YOUNG, left-wing radical similar to sotomeyor, ginsberg or kagen &mdash; meaning anti-White AA will be upheld, racial quotas will be enforced for college admissions, hate speech laws will handily pass, schools will be mandated to reintegrate, 0bama care will become the only way for Americans to receive health care. The second amendment will be attacked as well.
										</p>
										<p>
											Not great choices, I agree, but what else is there? I&rsquo;m going with the SCOTUS angle, I figure Iran will be invaded whether 0bama is reelected or a neo-con from the GOP.
										</p>
										<p>
											Either way, you can count on the following: continued high unemployment, a debasement of the American currency and never ending wars in the Middle East.

											Since Herman Cain is out of the race I am at a loss as to which candidate to back. It&rsquo;s never too early for grassroots and social networking pep rallies but it does seem too late for the Republicans to bring forward a worthy runner. So far, I like Michelle Bachman in the place of Cain but I fear she has no chance because of the money and clout behind Gingrich and Romney (I believe Perry will be out of the running soon enough and I don&rsquo;t like him, either). says &#8220;sincerely concerned&#8221;, poster #24.

											In continuation of my post #22 &mdash;
										</p>
										<p>
											Here is an example of Gingrich on the courts:
										</p>
										<p>
											<a href="https://tinyurl.com/6mmw9ol" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/6mmw9ol</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											Even if he won&rsquo;t follow through, the very fact that a serious
										</p>
										<p>
											presidential candidate voices such views is bound to have some
										</p>
										<p>
											impact. The courts are one of the main tools used to oppress us, by
										</p>
										<p>
											overturning patriotic measures adopted by the
										</p>
										<p>
											states and local government.
										</p>
										<p>
											As for Dr. Paul, I have seen no evidence that
										</p>
										<p>
											he would do anything to help restore the dominance
										</p>
										<p>
											of our founding populations. His creed &mdash; Libertarianism -
										</p>
										<p>
											considers any group rights to be &#8216;collectivism&rsquo;. Thus, while he would
										</p>
										<p>
											no doubt oppose AA (a position, however, unlikely to get anywhere
										</p>
										<p>
											without some sort of Gingrichesque radicalism on the matter of the judiciary),
										</p>
										<p>
											he would also oppose ethnic profiling at airports; questioning folks that look or sound Mexican about their immigration status; or any and all measures
										</p>
										<p>
											taken to restore pre-1965 immigration criteria, for instance.
										</p>
										<p>
											I&rsquo;m not saying Newt would do any of that either &mdash; his track record
										</p>
										<p>
											of following up on good radical ideas is a poor one &mdash; but rather,
										</p>
										<p>
											that some of his ideas are refreshing contributions that
										</p>
										<p>
											may become powerful &#8216;memes&rsquo; in the national discourse. And should Gingrich be the next POTUS, perhaps the seeds will be sown for some loosening of the death-vise Washington has on this country &mdash; thus enabling at least some regions of the country to save themselves, and perhaps serving as nuclei for an eventual restored USA.
