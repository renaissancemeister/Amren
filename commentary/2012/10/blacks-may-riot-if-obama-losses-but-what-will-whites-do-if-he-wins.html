<h1 class="title">Blacks May Riot If Obama Loses &mdash; But What Will Whites Do If He Wins?</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Peter Bradley, American Renaissance, October 26, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
They'll live in a country where the dominant party despises them and the other ignores them.</div> 
</div> 


<p>As Mitt Romney seems to be pulling into the lead in the presidential race, several articles have appeared wondering whether blacks will riot if their man losses. The Drudge Report highlighted many of these articles last week.</p>
<p>Judging from Twitter comments, a number of blacks are indeed promising violence if Mr. Romney wins. One of the more printable tweets is from &ldquo;Don Kushnelius&rdquo; who chirps, &ldquo;If Mitt Romney wins the election I think it&rsquo;s our duties as Black folks to riot and f*** s*** up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some talk of this in 2008 but by election day nobody thought Mr. McCain would win so the issue didn&rsquo;t get much attention. Still, the sight of white suburbanites gathering side-by-side with blacks in Chicago&rsquo;s Grant Park on election night in 2008 did make me wonder what would have happened to these SWPL (Stuff White People Like) types &mdash; some with small children &mdash; if Mr. Obama had lost.</p>
<p>Perhaps we will find out in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The nice white liberals who support Mr. Obama &mdash; and there are many in my profession and in my neighborhood &mdash; truly believe they are banding together with their black fellows to promote a progressive agenda of gay rights, more social services, a woman&rsquo;s right to choose, stopping global warming, and the like.</p>
<p>But most blacks have no interest in those issues and see the election simply as a bid for racial power and a chance to support one of their own. It would be the ultimate &ldquo;diss&rdquo; if Mr. Obama falls and America&rsquo;s only black president joins such losers as Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush on the list of failed presidents.</p>
<p>They could very well attack the first white people they see, even if those whites sport oversized &ldquo;Obama 2012&rdquo; buttons.</p>
<p>But I have my doubts that Mr. Romney can win.</p>
<p>A Republican victory is starting to seem likely if you listen to Rush Limbaugh, watch FOX News, or read the Drudge Report. These outlets were particularly pleased to trumpet recent Gallup polls showing Mr. Romney up by 6-7 points.</p>
<p>Real Clear Politics still has Mr. Obama up in the electoral college race, however, and a slew of new polls show him with slight leads in places such as Florida, Wisconsin, and Ohio. Mr. Romney cannot win without these states.</p>
<p>VDARE.com is running daily updates on the white vote, and the results show why the GOP is not winning these states. They simply do not have the 60-61 percent of whites they will need to win. Mr. Romney seems to be stalled at between 54 and 57 percent. This will certainly go up a bit as many undecided whites break Romney&rsquo;s way, but will it be enough to crack the 60+ percent he needs?</p>
<p>If not, he will have only himself to blame. From his pandering to Hispanics on immigration during the second debate to his refusal even to mention affirmative action, Romney has made no effort to reach whites. This is all the more unforgivable given that affirmative action is now being argued before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Constitution Party (CP), a conservative third party, is on the ballot in key swing states such as Virginia, Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. If Mr. Romney doesn&rsquo;t want to campaign for conservative votes then Virgil Goode, the CP presidential candidate, will be happy to take them.</p>
<p>So if blacks will riot if Obama losses, what will whites do if he wins? Of course, there are no Twitter threats of riots by whites. The worst reporters could find were vows by whites to leave the country.</p>
<p>A loss for the GOP will be a wake-up call for conservatives and whites in general. Though the Republicans don&rsquo;t do much for whites, they are seen as the only real political option for them. But demographics are about to wipe them out at the national level as Peter Brimelow and Ed Rubenstein <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/electing-a-new-people">pointed out</a> over 15 years ago in the pages of <em>National Review</em>.</p>
<p>In 2016, the GOP presidential candidate will probably need 64 percent of the white vote (more if there is an amnesty) barely to squeak by. To put that in perspective, that is the percentage of the white vote Ronald Reagan won when he ran for reelection. It was the high-water mark for the nationwide white vote, and was enough for a 49-state landslide &mdash; in 1984.</p>
<p>A Romney loss will no doubt renew the call for the Republicans to become &ldquo;more inclusive&rdquo; and support for an amnesty will be high on the list of overpaid GOP strategists. But given the demographics, it may not matter who wins yet another Republican civil war between RINOs and conservatives.</p>
<p>Certain Republicans would no doubt be glad to have issues like immigration and quotas permanently removed from the conversation. But if the Democrats have no challengers at the national level &mdash; and the Senate and House also start to feel the demographic effects &mdash; won&rsquo;t a one-party U.S. start to be run a lot like California?</p>
<p>What will this mean for issues that the GOP does still care about, such as taxes, spending, trade, and foreign policy?</p>
<p>Whites will not riot if Mr. Romney losses, but they should at least start thinking about their future in a nation where the dominant party despises them and the other party ignores them.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141883" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You raise an excellent point, in my opinion, which is, what would happen if we were to concentrate on purely conservative issues without regard to race?  If the welfare teat were to dry up, would that not of itself cause a drastic reduction in illegal immigration?</p>
<p>But does it end there?  Ending affirmative action has had some traction, though the loony leftists in the judiciary branches have done a great deal of damage to the implementation of  sensible limitations legislated at the state levels.</p>
<p>We also damage ourselves when we pursue conservative social issues.  Of course, I speak of abortion and gay marriage.  These should be avoided, as we concentrate on reasonable fiduciary policies, as well as personal freedom.  Allowing school choice, (or better yet, getting government completely out of Education) would solve many of the issues conservatives have with the gay lobbies.  If one can ensure that one&rsquo;s offspring are being taught in a conservative environment (can you just imagine a school where whites are not denigrated and the conservative parent&rsquo;s views are taught?!), who cares what the children of the leftists are learning?  And abortion (or even better, free birth control) for people who are parasites on society as well as lefties would only serve to reduce their numbers, and dare I say it, even violent crime.</p>
<p>So, coming out for restraints in government spending and for greater personal freedom seem to be winners to me that will mostly benefit a responsible populace.  And that responsible populace is mostly non-black and non-Hispanic.</p>
<p>Let Romney pander to the Mestizos all he wants, just as long as he shuts off the welfare spigots and has a moderate view on abortion and birth control.  Get the government out of my back pocket and I will breed as many white children as I can afford.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but I just realized that I am probably a libertarian.</p>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, there are something like 50 million people in the food stamp program. That number&rsquo;s from 2011, I think, so it&rsquo;s probably higher by now. 35 percent of the people in the program are non-Hispanic whites, so your solution would basically cut off the primary source of food for approximately 17 million white people. </p>

<p>It was not part of their blood,<br/>
It came to them very late,<br/>
With long arrears to make good,<br/>
When the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>They were not easily moved,<br/>
They were icy   &mdash;   willing to wait<br/>
Till every count should be proved,<br/>
Ere the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>Their voices were even and low.<br/>
Their eyes were level and straight.<br/>
There was neither sign nor show<br/>
When the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>It was not preached to the crowd.<br/>
It was not taught by the state.<br/>
No man spoke it aloud<br/>
When the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>It was not suddently bred.<br/>
It will not swiftly abate.<br/>
Through the chilled years ahead,<br/>
When Time shall count from the date<br/>
That the Saxon began to hate.</p>

<p>Further changes in this society will happen that part is mostly inevitable; white people just have to make sure they keep or get themselves into the best position possible to have as much of an advantage as they can racially.  </p>
<p>If I had any real influence as a white spokesman(whatever)I would play as many racial games, one-ups-manship, and make as many demands, reasonable or not, as blacks, illegals, and all the rest make.</p>
<p>Whites have to learn how to hustle too. I think that&rsquo;s the future. That&rsquo;s far more likely than wholesale slaughter of whites or big armed conflicts. There will be a lot of pushing and shoving.</p>

<p>The problem is Whites have been made to feel ashamed to advocate for our own self-interests. A situation which many believe has been engineered to erode white hegemony and allow multiculturalism. Thus your average white feels little racial solidarity, and is more likely to further his own self-interests, which over here in Europe means advancing liberalism and the diversity agenda.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141683" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>No offense taken, Wayne, my brother. </p>
<p>It reminds me of a physics problem- let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in a ship that is speeding along at x knots, and you&rsquo;re 800 yards away from a coral reef. Your engine shuts off, and you can&rsquo;t reverse, so do you A) go back to your cabin or B) jump? I&rsquo;ve run the numbers in my head, I just can&rsquo;t see us coming out on top, at least not here in America. America is dead, not dying, dead. It died a long time ago. America is like a huge machine that has been shut off- don&rsquo;t mistake the spinning cogs and whirs for life, it just takes a while before it grinds to a halt. </p>
<p>Our economy is not based on anything tangible- our dollars are confetti. There is nothing there- just vapor. We have been ruled by hideously evil men who have seen to it that we have no borders, Wayne. No borders. I don&rsquo;t know where you live, but I live in California. I think that is where our point of contention lies, Wayne. I have seen the horde with my own eyes. I have seen an entire state turn to ash in my own lifetime.  </p>
<p>I have seen my people, my beautiful, people outnumbered in a wink of an eye. I did not give birth to these brown people. They are not my children so don&rsquo;t blame me if each mexican woman has 6 babies here in the US. 6 on average! White people have been conditioned to hate themselves, to worry that they&rsquo;re destroying the planet, and our birthrate has slowed to a crawl. That is what determines a nation&rsquo;s success in a nutshell- the ability to keep squeezing out more people and we aren&rsquo;t doing that. We think about the future, and if times are hard, we have abortions or choose not to have children at all, where a black or a mexican just goes merrily along having 40 kids. </p>
<p>In this country, non-white births outnumber Whites for the first time. For the first time, Wayne- it&rsquo;s a milestone:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9271573/Non-white-births-outnumber-white-births-for-the-first-time-in-US.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9271573/Non-white-births-outnumber-white-births-for-the-first-time-in-US.html</a></p>
<p>Now, and here is the part where I just have to put up my arms and say we&rsquo;re done&hellip; there are several ways to fix this problem, all require a huge amount of pain. 1) shut off the border with troops, and deport every illegal and their families. Is that going to happen? Certainly not. The way our voting system is rigged, our evil tyrant politicians need the mexicans and so they actually fight for their votes! Here are both Republican and Democrat sides speaking spanish:</p>
<p><a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/michelle-obama-debuts-in-spanish-language-ad/" rel="nofollow">http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/michelle-obama-debuts-in-spanish-language-ad/</a></p>

<p>Romney, our great hope is not going to end immigration, he will do nothing. Bush did nothing, Obama does everything he can to bus them in. </p>
<p>2) Shut off all handouts, welfare, food stamps etc. Again, not going to happen. Too many dependent people. Why in their right mind would a man vote to end a check he gets in the mail every month. -</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444914904577619671931313542.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444914904577619671931313542.html</a></p>
<p>3) End affirmative action, allow people to rent or sell to whomever they want (or don&rsquo;t want) Again, not going to happen because people have been conditioned to think it is a basic human right for blacks to be forced to live in your area. There are actually stories of White women who were raped because, even though they saw their attacker coming up behind them, they were too afraid to run because that would be racist!!! Our police are even afraid:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184203/Fears-branded-racist-stops-police-investigating-crimes-ethnic-minorities.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184203/Fears-branded-racist-stops-police-investigating-crimes-ethnic-minorities.html</a></p>
<p>4) War. My favorite and actually only viable choice- unfortunately, again, not going to happen. Too much conditioning. A White would never pick up a gun in order to protect their lineage. There will be no Reich, no army, no cleansing force. </p>
<p>So what are we to do?? Colonize Mars? We have the brainpower to do it, but then again, that&rsquo;s what Amren is for- we can discuss things we can&rsquo;t discuss anywhere else. I&rsquo;m sorry, these are just cold, hard facts. When the only rational solution to our problem involves mass murder on a huge scale, that&rsquo;s just not going to happen. Not going to happen. Back in the old days, our ancestors waltzed in and wiped away the native Indians, but a repeat of that is not going to take place.-not with video cameras, CNN and Hollywood. It&rsquo;s a different time, and a different world. </p>
<p>The frontiers are gone, no where to run too. Even mother Germany is being turned into a multicultural hell hole. The next James Bond is going to be black for god&rsquo;s sake, Wayne-</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2223762/BLOGS-OF-THE-DAY-Will-black-James-Bond.html?ito=feeds-newsxml" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2223762/BLOGS-OF-THE-DAY-Will-black-James-Bond.html?ito=feeds-newsxml</a></p>
<p>We have nowhere to run, and our &#8220;people&#8221; have been conditioned into pansies. Good luck mobilizing the youth of the US in our cause. Good luck mobilizing anyone. I just don&rsquo;t see it. </p>

Still influencing negatively, still sucking up jobs, still collecting their Ponzi Social Security that my generation will never see. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141855" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You&rsquo;re right about a lot of what you say. But take heart. People can change their minds very quickly. One inspired individual is enough to change the minds of everyone else. All it takes is fresh ideas.</p>
<p>So we have a demographic crisis. Our racial rivals are out-breeding us. We&rsquo;re beleaguered and demoralized. Well, if we purge our society of the bad ideology which has been afflicting us, we&rsquo;ll do just fine, as a society.</p>
<p>The anti-white ideologues among us won&rsquo;t go down without a fight. But fight them we must, until they are completely marginalized. The most vile poison in the body of the white society is called Feminism. </p>
<p>The treachery of Feminists compels men to fight each other without cause, and to kill each other in multitudes. Men have done this throughout the course of history.</p>
<p>Civilization is based on the taming of the wild female, so that men can be productive over the course of our lives, rather than just living in a constant crisis brought on by the routine betrayal by our females. </p>
<p>Civilization is based on intimacy between a man and a woman. This intimacy is strongest when their relationship begins in her youth. Feminism seeks to deprive white men and white women of intimacy. </p>
<p>Know your enemy, know yourself, and know your battleground and you will win a hundred battles. But if you don&rsquo;t know any one of those three, you may not prevail. If you don&rsquo;t know two of those three, you will certainly be defeated. </p>
<p>Hear me now and believe me later. Regardless of how this election goes, putting women in their place is more than half the battle. Once that is done, racial solidarity emanates from strong families. </p>
<p>Sometimes you have to seize a woman by her hair. That&rsquo;s why she wears her hair long. Sometimes you have to smack a woman. That&rsquo;s why they can be made to cry so easily. Women are naturally submissive. Take advantage of this, or else you will leave them unhappy.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141803" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hello Luca, well, the way I see it, the Pilgrims struck out across the ocean and suffered such hardships. I think we would have almost the same chances of striking out across the ocean of space and terraforming a new planet. Difficult, yes, but what an accomplishment if it worked. But in any case, we have to do something, and this is where the problems lies, and I&rsquo;ll spell it out-</p>
<p>Our problem is that we all live in a nation, and we live on a planet which is overrun with non-whites. It would be great if we had our own little corner of the world where we could live out our lives, but that is never going to happen. The Romans built a beautiful civilization, and like always, their prosperity and relatively easy living attracted the barbarians. That is what we Whites do best: we develop beautiful civilzations that attract those who have no concept of civilization or civility.</p>
<p>In our sick civilzation, though, we have shifted trillions to savages who would just as soon kill us as look at us, through the buying of foreign oil, although we have plenty here at home that we can&rsquo;t suck up. We promote the immigration of illegals, and give them homes/food/healthcare/spending money etc., let them drive and vote. SICK SICK SICK! They are an invading army. Back in the day, they would have been dealt with as such. We pass out antibiotics to nations thousands of miles away, give foreign aid to psychos and send our people and armies aroudn the world for what? For what? They don&rsquo;t even know why they are there, which is why the favorite pastime of soldiers is suicide. </p>
<p>But that is where we are. If we took a show of hands, out of 7 billion people on Earth, who would like to live here, 7 billion hands would shoot up. So, how does one deal with this problem? How do you deal with a problem of people? Too many people here or there?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the rub. Our friends in Hollywood have made it to the point where we can&rsquo;t even open our mouths and mention the word &#8220;genes.&#8221; We can&rsquo;t talk about genetics in public, although we breed dogs and cattle every day and think nothing of that.</p>
<p>What do we do, say, with all the mexicans living in the US? Start an email campaign? &#8220;Vote with our feet?&#8221; Write them a strongly-worded letter? No, they won&rsquo;t leave peacefully. So that is where we are. Not a lot of options. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141934" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, there are plenty of very white states up North that those whites who want to move can relocate to. I don&rsquo;t understand why so many whites on these boards from up North want to come down South. The South is already overpopulated, and is becoming more and more that way. We already have a very large black population, as well as a growing hispanic population. We are even seeing more and more Asians down here, as our cities are becoming more technology and engineering oriented. Millions of liberal whites have relocated down here as well, bringing their hateful, anti-Southern attitudes with them. So when I see whites on these boards who mean well wanting to move South to a more conservative environment, I guess it is hard for me to be sympathetic and welcoming. Either stay in your own state and fix your own problems (that is what I am doing ), or move to a white state that is sparsely populated. There are several of them.</p>

<p>I was reminded recently that whites are 72% (yes, still) of the U.S. population. Let&rsquo;s not forget those numbers, as we agonize over the birth numbers. It helps to live in the heartland, I know, where for hundreds of miles there is nothing but land or small towns&hellip;and all white. I&rsquo;ve lived on the cost, and I know the feeling one there is very different.</p>
<p>Another positive is the quiet resurgence of traditionalism all through Western culture&hellip;and the fact that we&rsquo;re getting together   &mdash;   various &#8220;defense leagues&#8221; and anti-jihad groups. When we show our numbers (Chick-Fila, anyone?), we make the occupiers look like what they are   &mdash;   fringe. . Whatever the media and academia says, there are millions of us who turned them off years ago.</p>
<p>BO has done wonders for race realism. and it&rsquo;s in the open now, as much as the dinosaur media tries to hide it. We are the new cutting-edge. Not trying to be all smiley-faced&hellip;just sayin   &mdash;   we underestimate our numbers, because we become brainwashed by &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221;  that then smiles smugly in &#8220;victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Read Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s Rules For Radicals. Pitting the Haves against the Haves is a tactic in &#8220;transforming society for the better&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those who have more White privilege will always hurt those who have less White privilege in order to get even more! </p>
<p>&#8220;Many White people feel bereft because the leadership that we look to, the upper Bourgeois tier  &mdash;  the most educated part of our own society  &mdash;  seem to have left the majority. The elite has gone global and sees itself as part of a global elite, and the traditional brokers of power from the university lecturer to your senior businessman, to your senior lawyer and so on, always seem to be on the side of giving the line away. And that&rsquo;s because in the present day it suffices and works for you to be on the side that gives away what the past has bequeathed to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Jonathan Bowden, Western Civilzation Bites Back, Counter-Currents Publishing</p>
<p>Our Diversity President granted Diversity Amnesty to our racial enemies, and if Romney wins, he&rsquo;ll do the same thing.  We have no recourse.  To not be pessimistic and fatalistic right now means one is invested in ignorance.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s keep on that train of thought, what it really means is that America as it is now cannot last intact, and will not last. We whites have to accept this reality and get it through our heads that America must be divided up, it&rsquo;s going to happen anyway. </p>
<p>Whites won&rsquo;t be wiped out, it is a new beginning. We are at the edge where fantasy about restoring America as it was has met up with the reality that it has been dead for a long while.  </p>
<p>Many people are settling up in the Pacific North West, others in Appalachia, and other places. What we need is a coherent plan for the break-up which is inevitable and plan for an infrastructure, government,  economy, and all the other critical needs in order to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Get it straight, the colored mobs and their cultural Marxist masters have no intention of seeing America survive in any form. They are insane and will not stop their path of destruction. The only way to deal with them is to wall them off away from us until they kill each other off and then we can reclaim the territory after their bones have been picked by wild animals and insects.</p>

Those same private schools now highlight their &#8220;deep and lasting commitment to promoting Diversity&#8221; as much as the Southern Baptist Convention, historically White colleges and universities, and all Fortune 500 companies.

I have seen in the last few years, entire cities turning 90% Hispanic. These are the front lines, my friend. </p>
<p>And not to point fingers, but it must be nice to live in a 95% White small town, to have lived in your generation. I happen to be a young guy and look at what your generation did. Your generation didn&rsquo;t protect our borders. You all did nothing. You did nothing as our space program was pissed away. You did nothing when our banking system turned into a Ponzi scheme, learning nothing from the Great Depression. You guys pissed it all away, and now you&rsquo;re leaving it up to my generation to clean everything up??</p>
<p>Sure, the US is considered 72% White, but they consider White to be anyone -</p>
<p>&#8220;having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who reported &ldquo;White&rdquo; or wrote in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, you have to factor in that the illegals aren&rsquo;t represented, so their numbers are much higher. then you have to factor in that those &#8220;72%&#8221; White people include a huge number of older people, over 65. The majority of births in the US, which I linked earlier, are to non-white parents, so that is what my generation is looking at, Wayne. Those are my numbers.  That is my inheritence, that is my reality. </p>
<p>Nero fiddled when Rome burned, and your generation smoked its pot and left the present world in the state it is in, all for a little comfort. Live it up, and keep attacking me. </p>

The problem is that if that many whites were that racially aware, then we wouldn&rsquo;t be in the fix we&rsquo;re in right now. It&rsquo;s the old catch-22. </p>
<p>Why would that many whites show a sudden racial awareness when they&rsquo;ve been completely unable or unwilling to now? Besides, the whole world is caught up with political correctness, so there really is no place to move to. This whole &#8220;oh, we&rsquo;ll just move somewhere else&#8221; is just more wishful thinking. We either wake up soon or it&rsquo;s goodbye for whites.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141603" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this very scenario for a while. I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past Barack Obama, on the night of his ignominious defeat and in a self-serving &#8220;concession&#8221; speech, to blame his defeat on &#8220;White racism&#8221; and urge blacks all over the country to &#8220;protest&#8221; (African for &#8220;riot&#8221;) about it. And I do disagree with the writer, who seems to have swallowed the mainstream media liberal Kool-Aid; I believe Gov. Romney WILL win, and that riots by blacks as a result are, indeed, likely.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument that Obama does win   &mdash;   somehow. No, it&rsquo;s not likely that Whites will riot all over the country. But I doubt there will be a huge &#8220;White flight,&#8221; either. Where would we go? All the formerly White havens have been overrun. What I DO think might happen, given the huge increase in sales of firearms across the U.S. in the last four years, is a species of guerrilla warfare, by Whites who have finally awakened to their peril, and who have decided that it&rsquo;s time to stand and fight. It could be every bit as nasty and frightening for non-Whites, as riots by blacks would be for us. Guess we&rsquo;ll find out in about 11 days, won&rsquo;t we?</p>

Indeed, it will then be blamed on &#8220;racist&#8221; republicans and will be called &#8220;a wake up call to create better conditions in our inner cities,&#8221; and seen as a victory for the left. Hopefully this time the class-warfare rhetoric goes to their heads, and they attack a rich, white, leftist neighboorhood.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141646" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> The truth is that quantity never has and never will equal quality. I remember in the Army I had a Puerto Rican roommate who would constantly heckle me with eliminationist rhetoric about how &#8220;Brown people are taking over, because we&rsquo;re having more babies,&#8221; etcetera, etc. until one night I finally snapped and said, &#8220;You&rsquo;re not taking over jack. All you&rsquo;re doing is making more maids and fruit-pickers.&#8221; He shut up after that.</p>
<p>I imagine black people think they are running America (or are very close to attaining real power now) because the president happens to be black. But saying Obama runs America is like going into an Outback Steakhouse and saying the general manager of the store runs the Outback chain. Obama is a managerial headache, in terms of his radical, anti-white hostile appointments (Kagan, Sunstein, Van Jones, Sotomayor, Bolton, etcetera) but he is really just rearranging the chairs on the deck of a ship that ain&rsquo;t his. </p>
<p>The purpose of making America majority-minority is not to transfer power to blacks or Hispanics (or Muslims in the case of Western Europe and Scandinavia). It is to decrease the power of the white middle- and working-classes, who are still capable of opposing their elites. Once America is majority-minority, the power will still be concentrated among a small white elite, a la the Sinaloa white elite in Mexico, or the whites in Brazil and the rest of South America.</p>
<p>So if the people who are running things in these countries, and those who will continue to run things are white, why is this bad for white nationalists? Because again, these are white traitors of the Ted Kennedy variety, who would rather educate children in Africa than heed the democratic will of the whites in their own nations.  Majority minority America = the end of democratic rule, and I think that&rsquo;s the point. </p>

If elected he will be lucky because white people are going the way of the dodo, and he has shown them no respect, instead choosing to pander to people who will not vote for him. But the problem is that the economy will fail during this next term, and whatever party is in the White House when this happens will take the blame. Republicans will receive more blame than Democrats would because the mainstream media supports the Democrats (socialists/collectivists). So given an extinct constituency and the blame for a currency that has crashed, the Republicans will go the way of the Whigs and other political parties of the past.</p>
<p>If Obama wins, the economic problems will be even worse, but the media may allow the Democrats to continue to blame George Bush. Obama will drive the bus right off the cliff, and destroy the country, while the majority of whites stand around and watch. Ignorant liberals will actually cheer this.</p>
<p>If Obama loses, blacks WILL riot, and whites being the civilized race, will do nothing. I wish we would take care of the problem once-and-for-all, but unfortunately that is only a dream. Civilization has its drawbacks. A man fighting by Marquess of Queensberry rules will be at a distinct disadvantage to a dirty street fighter.

<p>Absolutely. Which is why I want Obama to win. If nothing else happens it will be funny seeing those liberals who fawned over him have to concede his legacy&rsquo;s one of abject failure. If Romney wins however, people will say that the wrong man was elected and Obama would have averted the catastrophe.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-141675" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>If Obama wins, Whites will attempt to go the legal route: they will take steps toward impeachment. At the federal level, Article II of the United States Constitution (Section 4) states that &#8220;The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
Obama is clearly a fraud, and although he may not be impeachable for being a homosexual, a dope addict, and a Marxist Communist, he would be impeachable for lying, non-disclosure, and misrepresentation: he has lied about his birth certificate, he has misrepresented himself with a phony social security card and about who his biological father is, and has failed to disclose his college records. Surely, such behavior on the part of the President of the United States of America constitutes misdemeanors.<br/>
 <br/>
The evidence on all of these points is now overwhelming. Obama may well be hoping that he loses the election rather than face the disgrace of being forced out of office through impeachment. The downside of this scenario is that Vice-President Joseph Biden would then become our president.<br/>
 <br/>
That&rsquo;s why everyone should vote for Governor Mitt Romney, especially those of you who are in swing states like Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and New Hampshire.<br/>

<p>On the other hand, I would still find it hard to vote for Romney because of his positions on other issues. For example we only have a few years to switch to 100% green and nuclear energy before the world&rsquo;s climate will be destroyed, and Romney will stand there cheering on the complete destruction of our climate which will last for the next few thousand years. The right wing extremists in the Republican Party made it very hard for it to become the white party, since most white people are quite left wing and liberal. I&rsquo;m not a US citizen though, so I don&rsquo;t get a vote (unless I vote Democrat). And I find myself cheering for Romney and hoping he wins.</p>

<p>Look at the massive Tea Parties from only a few years ago; 2012 will be the first presidential election since the Tea Party formed.  Look at the people coming out for Chick-Fil-A a few months ago to support a conservative business.  Look at the fact that an incarcerated felon almost beat Obama in the 2012 WV Democratic primary.  I think the mainstream press severely underestimates the loathing, contempt, and sometimes outright hatred salt-of-the-earth types, working class Whites, and the Nixonian &#8220;silent majority&#8221; feel toward this monstrosity of a &#8220;president&#8221; and his corrupt, banana republic administration (unprecedented SS protection for a Presidential adviser, Moochelle&rsquo;s tax-payer funded shopping sprees), his cult of personality (I pledge allegiance to Obama&hellip;), his narcissism (&#8220;I won&#8221;), his incompetence (Benghazi), &hellip; need I go on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it here now, and you&rsquo;re free to call me an idiot or a blowhard if I&rsquo;m wrong: I&rsquo;m predicting Romney will win, and win (sort of) big-300+ electoral votes, all the swing states (with the possible exception of NV), as well as a Rust Belt Surprise-perhaps both MI and PA.  The &#8220;conditions on the ground,&#8221; to borrow a military phrase, seem to suggest a huge surge in anti-Obama voters, and at least a moderate decline in the number of Obama voters from 2008.  </p>

Members of parliament have lost their seats because they have made racist remarks and so on. Multiculturalism, diversity and harmony are rammed down our children&rsquo;s throats from an early age and racism is probably regarded as the most reviled crime on our statute books. Nationalist groups and parties here &amp; overseas are invariably described as far right and/or neo Nazi or even nut cases. The Australian Federal Police have even indicated that they will monitoring web use to pick up possible race hate crimes before they happen.

One choice is to fight back on the turf that liberals claimed, and won. Homeschool your kids. If, you can&rsquo;t, run for the school board, if you can&rsquo;t,   join the PTA, if you can&rsquo;t, scrutinize your children&rsquo;s textbooks, if you can&rsquo;t,  why are you reading this website? Boycott everything that offends you, write letters, support everything that is representative of those principles you believe in. Write your congressman and senator about the need for the end of  legal immigration, the end of affirmative action; Tell them that the borders need to be impassable without proper documentation. Deport all illegal aliens. Now. No court cases. After that is accomplished, abolish the TSA, ditto Homeland Security. However, racial profiling will be instituted. Personally, I would prefer to see all Muslims removed from this country. In lieu of that, (since I don&rsquo;t see that happening under current law) burquas  are outlawed everywhere they could be construed as a danger to others. This includes: driving a motor vehicle, engaging in commerce as a customer at a place of business, having  a photo I.D. taken, working in employment which causes the burqua wearer to have contact with the public, in any way, shape, or form. Dang, the list goes on, and on. I don&rsquo;t know, back to revolution? Seems faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221; does not seem to be anything more than a derogatory term used by reactionaries to complain about the increase in social liberalism. That increase concerns changes in popular attitudes and behavior about things like inter racial marriage. Since the late 1950s inter racial marriage has increased. The approval of it has increased much more. <br/>
         <br/>
The white race is in no danger of annihilation, so by Raphael Lempkin&rsquo;s definition of genocide, it is not threatened by genocide. What is happening is a decline in racial bigotry by whites.<br/>
 <br/>

In the late 1970s, Wallace announced that he was a born-again Christian and apologized to black civil rights leaders for his past actions as a segregationist. He said that while he had once sought power and glory, he realized he needed to seek love and forgiveness.[note 3]In 1979, Wallace said of his stand in the schoolhouse door: &#8220;I was wrong. Those days are over, and they ought to be over.&#8221;[4]<br/>

<p>No. Cultural Marxism is a well-documented, um, leftist intellectual movement that deliberately set out to undermine Christian sexual mores, gender roles, religion, racial identity, and patriotism. Western culture did not change, it was changed. </p>
<p> &#8220;The white race is in no danger of annihilation, so by Raphael Lempkin&rsquo;s definition of genocide, it is not threatened by genocide. What is happening is a decline in racial bigotry by whites.&#8221; </p>
<p>See there. You&rsquo;re doing it right now. You are pathologizing white identity and ethnic self-preservation as &#8220;bigotry.&#8221; Do you know why there are white people in Australia? Because they didn&rsquo;t let Chinese move in and miscegenate with their children that&rsquo;s why. Otherwise, they would all look like Kazakhs, and that is probably what they will look like in a couple of generations thanks to the likes of you. The way you see it, any white person who wants white people to continue to exist is a &#8220;bigot&#8221; isn&rsquo;t that right? </p>
<p>&#8220;In the late 1970s, Wallace announced that he was a born-again Christian and apologized to black civil rights leaders for his past actions as a segregationist.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what? Mr. Wallace is in heaven now. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s already apologized to Autumn Pasquale and Colton Gleason, RIP, for his end-of-life temporary racial insanity.</p>
<p>Now go tell your boss (Is it Mr. Foxman or Mr. Potok?) that I said Shalom.</p>

One big point: for a variety of technical reasons, polls almost always overrepresent whites in their sampled populations, which means the polls showing a Romney lead are at best dubious. Conclusion: Romney has narrowed but not closed the gap; Obama still leads and Obama will win. Blame Romney&rsquo;s refusal to engage on &#8221;white&#8221; issues like affirmative action, his outright betrayal on illegals, and skillful Democrat attacks on his record of ruthless capitalist exploitation of American workers at Bain, especially outsourcing to China.</p>

This is a war with White men as the targets and the women as the spoils, but war is a very fluid atmosphere to say the least. Just like in the life giving fluid one race and one race only has the extreme advantage in a fluid environment. They can push and pick but eventually the multiculters will push enough to get the critical mass of White cooperation moving again and once that happens there is no force on this planet that can stop it.</p>
<p>We may lose Kalifornia, Florida, half the Mid Atlantic Coast and be pushed back in Texas and Washington but eventually it will click and those who remain will begin striking back.</p>
<p>Only one race has made entire Continents tremble, has destroyed cities in seconds or constantly snatched victory against uncountable odds since time began. Once that sleeping giant is awoken again things will change rapidly. Some claim Blacks are more athletic and Asian are more intelligent but no race cooperates and wages war like Caucasians. It is that simple. </p>

We are so darn ethical and fair to a fault that we have to be sold on such policies on universal principles like merit, or the best interests of the nation, not on &#8220;our tribe yay, their tribe boo.&#8221; You don&rsquo;t have to get grovelingly PC, but it&rsquo;s unwise to get openly pro-white either.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that whites have opposed AA and immigration, but they are looking for permission to oppose them, to be able to oppose them with a plausible set of arguments for opposing them that are more than openly racialistic. Politicians who craft such non-racialistic appeals (who also avoid the other pitfall of groveling PC), can latch on to incredible grassroots power.</p>

<p>Republicans achieved political success by advocating implicitly pro-white policies while publicly disavowing explicit pro-whitism. As long as whites were a majority, this approach could sorta kinda work against the explicit and implicit anti-white policy of the left. Now that whites are fast approaching minority status, your prescription for success is long past its sell-by date. </p>

That increase concerns changes in popular attitudes and behavior about things like inter racial marriage. Since the late 1950s inter racial marriage has increased. The approval of it has increased much more.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
No. Cultural Marxism is a well-documented, um, leftist intellectual movement that deliberately set out to undermine Christian sexual mores, gender roles, religion, racial identity, and patriotism.  Western culture did not change, it was changed.          &#8220;The white race is in no danger of annihilation, so by Raphael Lempkin&rsquo;s definition of genocide, it is not threatened by genocide. What is happening is a decline in racial bigotry by whites.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
See there.  You&rsquo;re doing it right now.  You are pathologizing white identity and ethnic self-preservation as &#8220;bigotry.&#8221;  Do you know why there are white people in Australia?  Because they didn&rsquo;t let Chinese move in and miscegenate with their children that&rsquo;s why.  Otherwise, they would all look like Kazakhs, and that is probably what they will look like in a couple of generations thanks to the likes of you.  The way you see it, any white person who wants white people to continue to exist is a &#8220;bigot&#8221; isn&rsquo;t that right? &#8221;In the late 1970s, Wallace announced that he was a born-again Christian and apologized to black civil rights leaders for his past actions as a segregationist.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what?  Mr. Wallace is in heaven now.  I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s already apologized to Autumn Pasquale and Colton Gleason, RIP, for his end-of-life temporary racial insanity.</p>
<p>Now go tell your boss (Is it Mr. Foxman or Mr. Potok?) that I said Shalom.</p>

<p>No, any new Plymouth Colony or Voortrek would be clearly impossible in today&rsquo;s overcrowded and 99.99 fully explored world. The precise opposite is happening, the millions in the 3rd world wants to leave their poverty and squalor and take the benefits of the society which we have created, be it the USA, Canada or here in Australia. This is a bit like 18th century England where families left the poverty of the countryside to find a new life in cities and towns. Some did well but for most is was just leaving one misery to find another. Much the same as for 3rd world immigrants today.</p>
<p>I will extend the hand of friendship to anyone who comes my way, I will also do my best to help my neighbor in need. But I never want my neighbor to tear down the fence, break open the front door and take up residence in my apartment and change my lifestyle, it is just not right, same goes for unwanted immigration.</p>
<p>As for the children of mixed marriages I have observed the following. Part Filipino and other Asian young people want to be 100 Australian and can usually fit into &#8220;White&rsquo; society. Half African kids seem to live in a very depressing no-mans land. Half  Maori, Aboriginal or Pacific Islanders often become radical advocates of their own ethnic group. As for part Middle East Muslims, very few around, it would be mildly suicidal for an Australian to even think of dating an Islamic teenager.</p>
<p>When it comes to inappropriate immigration, forced multiculturalism, PC &amp; AA, these are all so totally wrong and must be stopped before our western civilization and way of life go in to terminal decline. As the famous historian Arnold Toynbee once said, &#8220;Civilizations do not get destroyed, they just commit suicide&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-142010" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good article. It goes to illustrate what Dr. Kevin MacDonald referred to as implicit vs. explicit whiteness. Many people think that to win, whites can only emphasize the implicit whiteness and ignore the explicit. Romney&rsquo;s struggling candidacy shows, after many years of white demographic decline, why such a policy is ultimately doomed to fail.</p>
<p>There seems to be a foreboding feeling among people that this election is the very last one in which a white man has a chance at winning. If Obama wins, it may seal in an eternal succession of minority presidents, with a concomitant growth of Congressmen, Supreme Court Justices, and Attorneys General.</p>
<p>The liberals, as everyone knows, make no bones or apologies for their explicitly anti-white crusading. It is time for us to stop pretending that we can ignore the people throwing rocks at us (sometimes literally) and come right out and state who we are and what we stand for.</p>
<p>Of course, Romney is not the man for us. Which is why I for one will not vote for him or anyone else. If the US empire is to collapse, then let it happen on Obama&rsquo;s watch. Perhaps a few more black flash mobs and anti-white bigotry will be what&rsquo;s needed to jar the fence-sitters out of their position.</p>
<p>Only then will we have a chance to take our country back.</p>

 <br/>
Unless you or anyone can list Cultural Marxists who call themselves &#8220;Cultural Marxists,&#8221; my point stands that it is not a movement, but a term of derogation that is used by the right to defame social liberals. <br/>
 <br/>
There are millions of Americans, including many libertarians, who like to say that they are &#8220;socially liberal.&#8221; As with the case of real Marxists, I have not heard any of them call themselves &#8220;Cultural Marxists.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
Indeed, I never even heard of Cultural Marxists until I began to access the American Renaissance website. I am fairly well informed about politics, so if there was a movement calling itself &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221; I probably would have heard of it. <br/>
         <br/>
Since 1970 the American consensus has moved to the right on economic issues and to the left on social issues. I have always disliked the sexual revolution, but Hugh Hefner and Helen Gurley Brown never called themselves &#8220;Cultural Marxists.&#8221; Jesse Jackson and Ralph Nader never called themselves &#8220;Cultural Marxist&#8221; either. <br/>

As an organized movement with leaders who articulate its goals and values and who call themselves &#8220;Cultural Marxists&#8221; Cultural Marxism does not exist. What does exist is a growing and inchoate desire to make a multi cultural, multi racial society work. <br/>
     <br/>
In a 2003 interview John Derbyshire said, &#8220;The kind of thoughtful and intelligent young people that [National Review] would like to have as readers&hellip;are&hellip;determined to make the multiracial society work, they believe it can be made to work&hellip;and they are unwilling to read, say, or think anything that could be construed as unkind towards people of other races. The pessimism and cynicism on this topic that you rather commonly find among conservatives - including NR readers - born in 1930, or even 1950, are profoundly unappetizing to these younger conservatives.&#8221;<br/>

But when Marxists describe what they stand for, they&rsquo;ll certainly call themselves Marxists and say &#8220;culture&#8221; this and &#8220;culture&#8221; that all the time.</p>
<p>BTW, that quote was 2003, it will be a lot less true in 2013. Young white people are starting to rebel against the system, especially now that white children are an oppressed minority.</p>

Ashkenazi Jews have DNA markers that link them to sephardic Jews, and to what is now Israel three thousand years ago. The Ashkenazim owe their status as intellectually the most superior racial group to population pressures that existed from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the eighteenth century Enlightenment. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-142162" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So I guess next time someone calls Mr. Taylor a &#8220;racist&#8221;, he can respond as follows:</p>
<p>There is no movement of people calling themselves &#8220;racists&#8221;, therefore I am not a racist, there are no racists, and there is no such thing as racism.  I&rsquo;m sure that will go over real well.  </p>
<p>Now, numerous Cultural Marxists have explicitly stated their desire to destroy Western Civilization and genocide white people, to wit, the original Sexual Revolutionary pervert himself, Sigmund Freud:</p>
<p>Hannibal. . . had been the favourite hero of my later school days. . . .<br/>
I began to understand for the first time what it meant to belong to an alien<br/>
race . . . the figure of the semitic general rose still higher in my esteem. To<br/>
my youthful mind Hannibal and Rome symbolized the conflict between the tenacity<br/>
of Jewry and the organisation of the Catholic Church . . . </p>
<p>I am, as you know, cured of the last shred of my predilection for the<br/>
Aryan cause, and would like to take it that if the child turned out to be a boy<br/>
he will develop into a stalwart Zionist. He or she must be dark in any case, no<br/>
more towheads. Let us banish all these will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps.</p>
<p>Freud&rsquo;s modern day disciple smut-peddler Al Goldstein:</p>
<p>Extending the subversive thesis, Jewish involvement in the X-rated industry<br/>
can be seen as a proverbial two fingers to the entire WASP establishment in<br/>
America. Some porn stars viewed themselves as frontline fighters in the<br/>
spiritual battle between Christian America and secular humanism. According to<br/>
Ford, Jewish X-rated actors often brag about their &lsquo;joy in being anarchic,<br/>
sexual gadflies to the puritanical beast&rsquo;. Jewish involvement in porn, by this<br/>
argument, is the result of an atavistic hatred of Christian authority:<br/>
they are trying to weaken the dominant culture in America by moral subversion.<br/>
Astyr remembers having &lsquo;to run or fight for it in grammar school because I was a<br/>
Jew. It could very well be that part of my porn career is an &ldquo;up yours&rdquo; to these<br/>
people&rsquo;. Al Goldstein, the publisher of Screw, said (on lukeford.net), &lsquo;The only reason that Jews<br/>
are in pornography is that we think that Christ sucks. Catholicism sucks. We<br/>
don&rsquo;t believe in authoritarianism.&rsquo; Pornography thus becomes a way of defiling<br/>
Christian culture and, as it penetrates to the very heart of the American<br/>
mainstream (and is no doubt consumed by those very same WASPs), its subversive<br/>
character becomes more charged. Porn is no longer of the &lsquo;what the Butler saw&rsquo;<br/>
voyeuristic type; instead, it is driven to new extremes of portrayal that<br/>
stretch the boundaries of the porn aesthetic. As new sexual positions are<br/>
portrayed, the desire to shock (as well as entertain) seems clear.Film Director Gary Ross explaining why he made the move Pleasantville, a celebration of decadence, family breakdown, and miscegenation:&ldquo;This movie is about the fact that personal repression gives rise to larger political oppression…That when we&rsquo;re afraid of certain things in ourselves or we&rsquo;re afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a lot of very ugly social situations can develop&rdquo;.</p>

Soon after that, you will witness something Biblical in nature. The full and unadulterated fury of the Dept. of Homeland Security backed by the US Armed Forces attempting to break this place into a smoldering ruin. If it survives, and it may, you then will push westward seizing with extreme prejudice everything in your path until you get to the Pacific Ocean for the coveted sea port. By then, you will know what real men, hard men, the type that are rare today are made of.

<p>The feminist have completely abandoned their race and cultural history and allied themselves with every non-White group they can possibly find to attack White men and only White men.</p>
<p>How you can even claim it has anything to do with sexism while your feminist sisters scream diversity and worship other cultures who&rsquo;s entire life is built on sexism and then point a finger at White men as being sexist is beyond me.</p>
<p>The truth is it is about power and money and the feminist are willing to sacrifice their race and heritage to get it because it evolves taking it from White men and they know they will be desirable to the black and brown savages.</p>
<p>Until we deal with feminism, or nature deals with it as I think she is about to do. The White race will always be divided and this country will always be 3 wolves and 2 sheep voting on whats for dinner.</p>

President Obama is a moderate president with a squeaky clean family. The most radical thing he has done is to introduce a health plan that is almost the same as the health plan Mitt Romney introduced in Massachusetts.<br/>

From reading some of the posts here I could almost get the idea that Louis Farrakhan is running for reelection, having promised to commit genocide against whites, and that vast death camps with  huge gas chambers and crematoriums are already being built.    </p>

 <br/>
Their anger could only be understood psychologically. The U.S. economy was recovering from the recession of George H.W. Bush. There were plenty of jobs.  The country was at peace. <br/>
 <br/>
But they were angry nevertheless - oh how they were angry! - and they expressed their anger by spending hours every week listening to the lying demagoguery of right wing hate radio.<br/>
 <br/>
Many of those who have commented on this thread seem to be frightened white men. They are frightened that a black man will take their girl friend or wife. They are frightened that an Oriental of either sex will take their job. Basically, they are frightened of an economy and society where being white and male is no longer good enough. Now they need to perform. IQ matters. <br/>
 <br/>
They express their anger by hating That Man in the White House, who by interesting coincidence happens to be black. He is also a devoted family man who attends church with a fair degree of regularity, and who seems to be faithful to his wife. His most radical act has been to introduce a health plan nearly the same as that of his Republican opponent. None of that matters. They hate him nevertheless. They fear white genocide. <br/>
 <br/>
Yes times are hard. My computer programming career died on me a number of years ago. When Dad was my age he was much more successful than I am. I&rsquo;m angry about it, but I am not going to express my anger by voting a Republican who has made a fortune by firing white men like me. The GOP is not the party for white men. It is the party for rich white men. <br/>

<p>In 1982, it was the Plyler v. Doe decision, another 5-vote decision, that normalized the illegal migration of whole families by forcing taxpayers to pay for K-12 education for illegal aliens.  These are just two decisions   &mdash;   there are a score more of like magnitude   &mdash;   that have remade America along lines leftists could never dream of achieving through the legislative process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Engelman&#8221; certainly knows this.  Likewise, I have trouble believing other anti-Romney commenters are unaware of the immense power of the federal courts. </p>

 <br/>
As long as the Supreme Court makes decisions one approves of it is easy to imagine that it consists of nine sages of infinite wisdom who spend their days poring over ancient manuscripts in search of The Absolute Truth. <br/>
 <br/>
Those who appeal to the U.S. Constitution like to imply that it has obvious meanings that their political opinions are too stupid to recognize, or too dishonest to acknowledge. Liberals and conservatives do this. If the Constitution had clear and specific meanings Supreme Court justices - who presumably are experts on the matter - would make unanimous decisions. <br/>
      <br/>
Instead, the members of the Supreme Court read their personal values and concerns into the Constitution in order to make decisions which are often unpopular with the voters. <br/>
 <br/>
I would like for the power of the Supreme Court to be reduced by an amendment to the Constitution that would end the need for future amendments. It would require a two thirds majority for any Supreme Court decision. Any decision could be repealed by a two thirds vote in each house of Congress, and a presidential signature. Unpopular justices could be removed by popular referendums. <br/>
 <br/>
I would like for state supreme courts and federal courts to be weakened the same way. Many states already have recall elections for unpopular state supreme court justices.</p>

In November I will vote against Mitt Romney, who has made a fortune firing people and appropriating their incomes. In 2008 I voted against George W.

<p>Whilst I agree with you with regards to the Republicans not being the party for white men, I think you&rsquo;re wrong to dismiss white anger as irrational as you seem to have done. Globalization and free trade have ruined industry by flooding the US with cheap, imported goods and contributed towards a US debt crisis, though there&rsquo;s still money to fight Zionist wars in the Middle East. The Mexican Reconquista movement&rsquo;s being aided and abetted by US politicians and demographic trends show that whites will be a minority by 2040 and white hegemony will have gone long before that. Statistics show blacks are far more likely to murder and commit violent and sexual crimes yet benefit from affirmative action, whilst we are made to feel guilty about our history despite the fact we have developed the most successful and freest country in the world, a veritable magnet for people from the four corners of the globe. </p>

Now I enjoy investigating different points of view. That is why I access the American Renaissance website nearly every day. I have learned quite a bit here. If anyone reading this comment has not read Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;The Color of Crime,&#8221; I recommend it.<br/>
 <br/>
<a href="http://www.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime2005.html " rel="nofollow">http://www.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime2005.html </a><br/>
 <br/>
I also recommend reading &#8220;RACE, EVOLUTION,  AND BEHAVIOR,&#8221; by Professor J. Philippe Rushton, who spoke at six American Renaissance Conferences. <br/>
 <br/>
http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf     <br/>
 <br/>
It was on American Renaissance that I learned about &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution.&#8221; This is one of the most fascinating books I have read in my life. It explains the evolution of the racial differences documented by Jared Taylor and Philippe Rushton.<br/>

When I investigate different points of view I do not want confirmation of what I already believe. I want to be surprised by what I had not already known. I want fact based arguments, that reach conclusions by logical reasoning. <br/>

Rush Limbaugh has become a multi millionaire by telling his dittoheads lies they want to believe. </p>

<p>Honestly, your only regret is that you can&rsquo;t be one of them, at least not at that level. You obviously consider yourself to be part of that set that is completely detached from other whites. You think of yourself as the high tech elite and that is your only loyalty. To you, culture, race, and the entire history of the white race is irrelevant. You live in a vacuum where race is concerned. That&rsquo;s why you appreciate members of other races who have entirely turned their backs on their own. In addition to people-with-white-skin only,  Jews and the biggest, juicy brainiest of the Orientals are all part of the global club you desperately want to be a member of. You&rsquo;re now a people unto yourselves. </p>
<p>So, if I&rsquo;m a member of the lumpen white masses, I&rsquo;ll embrace that, and, if necessary, continue to work against non-whites as well as for my own. If there is the chance of my race being lost and buried under a multi-racial heap, than that is bad enough for me to react to negatively. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be outright genocide for me and others to resist.</p>

<p>This was inevitable because there are no real-world examples of peaceful multicultural societies, only bloody warfare or an authoritarian government AKA, the Soviet Union to keep the peace among waring tribes.</p>
<p>All races are naturally ethno-centric and when it comes down to sharing resources, well, there will be no sharing.  This goes for the United States, the UK and anywhere else whites exist. White homelands flooded with the high-fertility sludge of the world = white genocide.</p>
<p>Anyone who says otherwise is 100% wrong.</p>

<p>Like I said, a physical genocide, the literal killing of white people, doesn&rsquo;t have to occur for people to be legitimately alarmed at the state of the white demographic. There IS a form of persecution and a soft tyranny against whites taking place in our own homelands. I&rsquo;m concerned about living under the thumb of other races and living in the same country as white people with your mindset. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re being sincere, then I wouldn&rsquo;t describe you as a &#8216;race traitor&rsquo; or even precisely anti-white, but you do have a sort of contempt for most other whites. Po&rsquo; white trash like the rest of us can just be written off along with blacks, hispanics, whatever; except, of course, for your precious Ories, and a handful of whites and jews that meet your criteria. Which by now is becoming more and more unclear. </p>
<p>See how long you can ride above the rest of us until they notice the haughty white guy in the room that presumes to think he is one of the elite. You don&rsquo;t have the chops.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-142548" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am a small business man. I am white. I am independent but conservative.<br/>
I voted for Obama in 2008. I will NOT vote for him in 2012.<br/>
It is NOT the color of the man..it is the character of the man that bothers me. It is the hypocrasy of the man that bothers me. He preaches about redistribution of wealth as he basks in wealth. His &#8220;grass roots group&#8221; is filthy rich folks in Hollywood, etc.  He spends money like he is the king of serfs. He acts like he is royalty. Bush screwed up..yes. The difference in character is evident with his wife as well. Laura Bush had 2 assistants. Michelle has over 50.<br/>
The 18 tax breaks for small business he purports to have instituted is a sham. Most have expired. Many have been watered down. I would LOVE to run my business the way he runs the country. Borrow..borrow..borrow with no plan to pay it back. Then borrow some more and no budget. When the banks want their money back, just say in due time&hellip;and then ask for more money.<br/>
I have NO PROBLEM with black or Hispanics or any race being president/vice president. I would vote for Connie Rice for President in the blink of an eye. A BLACK WOMAN no less. I also would vote for Charles Payne, a black economist. I would vote for him as he was born in Harlem, impoverished, beaten up at a kid, but rose to overcome this and make something of himself.<br/>
Alan Keyes..No problem again for me! But, Alan Keyes was ahead of his time! So, no..it isn&rsquo;t the color. It is the integrity. The knowledge. The leadership.<br/>
One last thing..the man goes to church regularly. Claims to be a Christian. But, supports abortion. Live birth abortion, no less. All I can say on this is&hellip;God have mercy on his soul. I can claim to be a Russian Czar but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I am one.</p>

<p>Religious conservatives are conservative where it doesn&rsquo;t matter, and liberal where it does. The results are seen in all the primitives being imported into formerly safe white communities by churches with the connivance of the government.</p>
<p>Funny how you never hear the usual suspects, who are always flapping their gums about separation of church and state, mention this collusion.</p>
