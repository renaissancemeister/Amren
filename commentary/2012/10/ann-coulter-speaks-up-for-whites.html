<p>Ann Coulter&rsquo;s recently published <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595230998/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1595230998&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20">Mugged</a> </em>is a must-read for race realists. In it, Miss Coulter dares to discuss racial prejudice and bias against whites. While she is not anti-black, Miss Coulter excoriates anyone who wants to stop whites from seeking fairness in America. Whether or not it was Miss Coulter&rsquo;s intention, she is an advocate for whites. Miss Coulter does not pull any punches, even in her chapter titles. &ldquo;Innocent Until Proven White,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guilty Until Proven Black,&rdquo; and &ldquo;White Guilt Kills&rdquo; give an indication of her thinking.</p>
<p>Miss Coulter targets race hustlers she believes have gone unchallenged for too long. She points out that a 1983 videotape of Al Sharpton discussing a cocaine shipment with an undercover FBI agent was not made public until 2002. If this video had been released earlier it might not have changed the media&rsquo;s view of Rev. Sharpton, but it probably would have changed that of ordinary Americans. Miss Coulter also notes that Rev. Sharpton has managed to live down the infamous Tawana Brawley rape hoax &mdash; something that would have permanently discredited a white man.</p>
<p>As for Jesse Jackson, Miss Coulter quotes the black writer John McWhorter: Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;self-aggrandizing machinations have left behind not a single successful project that would improve black lives beyond the board-rooms of his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chapter &ldquo;Rodney King &mdash; The Most Destructive Edit in History&rdquo; is a synopsis of what is wrong with America. A black, drunk, violent, ex-con on parole leads police on a dangerous chase. They stop his car, and most of what follows is captured on videotape. Footage of Mr. King attacking police is edited out, leaving for public consumption images of police subduing a black man with batons. A jury, which sees the entire tape, finds the white cops innocent of brutality, and blacks riot. A white man, Reginald Denny, is nearly beaten to death and blacks burn Los Angeles as America watches. The result is 54 dead, thousands injured, and a billion dollars in damage.</p>
<p>America ignores the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution because of pressure from politicians, race mongers, and the media. The cops are tried again, and are sent to prison for properly subduing a drunk, violent, ex-con on parole.</p>
<p>Mr. King receives several million dollars in taxpayer money, while the blacks who beat Reginald Denny and danced in ecstasy at their escapade are cleared of all felony charges. KTLA TV Los Angeles &mdash; which was the first station to edit the tape of the beatings &mdash; gets an award and accolades for its coverage of the riots. Black congresswoman Maxine Waters&rsquo; view of the riots: &ldquo;I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mainstream media has become the Fourth Estate in America &mdash; it wields as much power as a branch of government. But America also has a Fifth Estate: college and university faculty. Miss Coulter points out that in the case of the white-on-black rape hoax at Duke University, the faculty was just as willing as the media and race hustlers to jump from accusation to verdict.</p>
<p>Miss Coulter contrasts the Duke case with that of Channon Christian and Christoper Newsom, both of whom were white. They were carjacked, raped, tortured, and murdered by five blacks. The no-justice-no-peace crowd was indifferent to their plight. Miss Coulter points out that liberals salivate at the merest hint of a white-on-black rape, even though such rapes are have been almost nonexistent for years. Black-on-white rape is an epidemic &mdash; thousands every month &mdash; and has been for some time.</p>
<p>Liberals, the media (but I repeat myself), and race mongers will recoil from Ann Coulter&rsquo;s book, but it is well researched and documented, and she speaks the truth. The only weapon liberals have against the truth is the cry of &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; but this is becoming less and less effective. Books like Miss Coulter&rsquo;s are helping to make it so.</p>

As a woman, she could be thought of as part of an aggrieved minority too. Maybe that&rsquo;s why she gets away with more. Her looks also help&hellip; for some.</p>

<p><b>Bingo!</b></p>
<p>Five years ago, only Michelle Malkin   &mdash;   an Asian woman (double minority)   &mdash;   was allowed to speak out about these issues on the MSM. (Michelle has proved for years the falsity of the assertion of some AmRen posters that Asians will never aid whites.)</p>
<p>Now, Ann, a mere &#8220;single minority&#8221; (Are women really a minority of the US population?), is able to address these issues on the MSM.</p>
<p><b>Jared Taylor: stay healthy, for in about 5 years, your day will come!</b> ~2017 a white man might be able defend whites on the MSM.  So eat healthy; don&rsquo;t smoke; exercise w/weights 2x/wk and w/aerobics 3 or 4x/wk; do not sit for more than 4 hours without getting up and moving around or doing light exercise; get a full night&rsquo;s sleep each night; reduce stress; drive a car that has an excellent safety rating by the IIHS.org and NHTSA (www.safercar.gov); and incorporate this <i>Crime Avoidance and Self-Defense Advice</i> into your life:<br/>

<p>Wait, Detroit WASP, now California WASP?  I guess &#8220;WASP&#8221; in the handle is shorthand for quasi-white-advocate, or maybe pseudo-white-advocate?  I guess it follows, since healthy-minded White men don&rsquo;t refer to themselves as &#8220;WASPs.&#8221;  As someone rightly pointed out recently on Sailer&rsquo;s blog, it&rsquo;s a hostile exonym, and there don&rsquo;t seem to be many good reasons to self-identify as such.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, your assertion makes as much sense as saying one good black man proves segregation is a bad thing.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s your significant example to prove that mongols will now collectively help Whites, really?</p>
<p>Malkin is just ONE mongol conservative columnist who also happens to be married to and has two children with a WHITE man, you knucklehead !  There&rsquo;s already way more black and hispanic conservative  columnists than her kiddo, and they have had absolutely no weight to shift their communities to our side, all right ? </p>
<p>For the last time junior: </p>
<p><b> No race, ethnicity or society takes on the characteristics of its exceptions.</b>  </p>
<p>It &#8216;s also been well documented here on AmRen, over and over again, that the overwhelming majority of mongols in the US vote consistently for democrats and are strongly in favor of pushing their racial agenda to benefit from &#8220;diversity&#8221;, social programs, government contracting, family reunification  and most of all political gain. </p>
<p>This latest attempt to associate that token mongol while patronizing Jared Taylor is beyond pathetic by the way, and exposes once again not only your immaturity but the complete irrelevance of your personal bias to the advancement of White identity. </p>

<p>Since I can&rsquo;t reply to your post, I&rsquo;ll reply here.</p>
<p>Your assertion that &#8220;Asians never will aid Whites&#8221; is your opinion (and prediction) not supported by any facts. </p>
<p>Michelle Malkin is an Asian American woman and has already aided whites in America by publicly raising issues and taking positions that popular white &#8220;conservatives&#8221; didn&rsquo;t back when she did and white &#8220;liberals&#8221; were and are against. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>(1) Michelle reported on the Christian &amp; Newsom murders back in 2007 May 16- almost 5 1/2 years ago   &mdash;   long before any popular white &#8220;political conservative&#8221; commentators.<br/>
<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/05/16/the-horror-in-knoxville/" rel="nofollow">http://michellemalkin.com/2007/05/16/the-horror-in-knoxville/</a> </p>
<p>(2) Even before that, Michelle linked to an article about it<br/>
in 2007 April 16, as well as to articles by Derbyshire re race, and Heather MacDonald about blacks&rsquo; true crime rates:<br/>
<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2007/04/16/race-crime-and-media-taboos/" rel="nofollow">http://michellemalkin.com/2007/04/16/race-crime-and-media-taboos/</a> </p>
<p>She has continued to follow the Christian-Newsom criminal cases since then:<br/>
<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/category/media-bias/christiannewsom-murders/" rel="nofollow">http://michellemalkin.com/category/media-bias/christiannewsom-murders/</a> </p>
<p>Those are facts, Svigor. Thus, even if you had provided any supporting facts you cannot logically say &#8220;Asians never will aid Whites&#8221; (emphasis added), since Michelle already has.</p>
<p>An extra:<br/>
(3) She&rsquo;s against birthright citizenship for children of foreign tourists, foreign temporary workers, and illegal aliens, and against &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; cities for illegal aliens.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin#Viewpoints" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin#Viewpoints</a><br/>
(Note the footnotes supporting each of those positions on the Wiki page.)  </p>
<p>But you, Svigor, say declare that Michelle is not helping whites in America by publicly advocating those political positions&hellip;. </p>
<p>AmRen readers now have a better idea of how much weight and credibility to give to your statements.</p>

<p>Listen to Taylor&rsquo;s presentation at Towson posted on Oct 5th and observe the 8 year old mental age of the black questioners, and then think what the best and brightest white students would sound like by comparison.  Also read at least some of Phil Rushton&rsquo;s work.  Then break free of the chains of the simple minded cultural marxists brainwashing, and freely express your opinion.</p>

And whilst I agree with you that many of the black attendees were rude and ill-informed, I&rsquo;m not so sure if it is genetic differences that lead to this. Personally I would like to believe in race differences, it would make my job of being anti-non white immigration a lot easier. I will, though, look into this more after graduation, as it is I have no time to look into the facts. As I said I don&rsquo;t disbelieve the theory, merely that I did not believe it either. I do believe it is despicable how people who do believe this get so bullied by liberals though, certainly you are the better people in my book for going with a theory that is so much harder to argue for in the current climate, rather than take the easy road like many do.</p>

Try it once on a website or forum not populated by race-realists. I think it&rsquo;s important to experience being ostracized for speaking the truth because it gives you a better sense of how vindictive and closed-minded the other side is. But it&rsquo;s good to go through that process because you&rsquo;ll feel better about yourself for standing behind truth rather than burying truth to be accepted. You&rsquo;ll also find that while many will hate you, some people will deeply respect you and even support you. I think such ostracizing experiences are necessary for the evolution from the indoctrinated to the truth tellers. After a couple such experiences you won&rsquo;t even care about being ostracized.</p>

<p>What we need is people of substance speaking true principles.  Coulter is a flighty dingbat with no principles.  She occasionally gets it right, but her message is contaminated by the other silly things she wites, and even by her lifestyle.  There is no benefit to us in being associated with her.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136118" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> I tend to agree with So Cal Snowman on the topic of Ann Coulter.   This woman is an avaricious opportunist and I have long doubted that she really has any rock-solid, core convictions or firm set of values or principles.    She is most certainly no where close to being a committed White Nationalist.</p>
<p>She is basically a bomb-thrower, and she does have a keen instinct as to which topics will result in tweaking the left&rsquo;s most sensitive nerves and bringing about the (a) most hysterical reaction from the left and also (b) result in causing so-called conservatives  to scurry down to their local bookstores to buy her latest book, thereby putting lots of money in to Annie&rsquo;s bank account.</p>
<p>Snowman is 100 percent correct.  She is a neo-con shill who is closely affiliated with the despicable war mongering David Horowitz, an agent for a foreign nation who eagerly wants to embroil America into endless wars which result in mostly White male combat soldiers being killed or horribly wounded and maimed for life.</p>
<p>Hence, while Annie tries to make money off a book like this - which focuses on the mostly black race hustling game, she remains curiously silent on an even more serious race hustling enterprise that David Horowitz and Mike &#8216;The Savage&rsquo; Weiner and the rest of these vile neo-cons have been running?</p>

<p> We must stop to consider that even though her methods are rather unacceptable for many of us, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to label someone who may have dated blacks (although I have doubts) a &#8220;racist.&#8221; I have a feeling if not for her &#8220;activities,&#8221; she would not be as well known a figure, and would be more marginalized-writing skill/material or not.</p>
<p>I have to believe she is an ally and hope that a book with valid truths could not have been made without some belief on the part of the author.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136124" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> It is also why Sarah Palin, who was romantically involved with a black basketball player (Glen Rice) during her years as a sportscaster, is permitted to get so much face time on the controlled mainstream media.</p>
<p>And, now - Paul Ryan, with his former college &#8216;sweetheart&rsquo; (a black female), deliberately chosen to be the VP candidate on the Romney ticket.  You can bet that if Romney wins, this black female will be all over the mainstream media, get showered with lucrative book deals, and probably get her own TV show.    Maybe even a juicy movie offer.</p>
<p>See the game that our Cultural Marxist enemies are playing, folks?  In a not-so-subtle fashion, these vile enemies are deliberately sending a signal that to advance your career, to have any hope of increasing your exposure and/or celebrity status - it is a wise and very savvy career move to hit the sheets with a non-white.  Preferably with a black, since this race is the most genetically toxic and can most quickly overwhelm and destroy White European regressive genes - and is therefore the race that these White genocide craving Cultural Marxists work the hardest to get Whites to race mix with.    </p>
<p>None of this is coincidental, and neither is it innocent.   It is intentional.  It is deliberate.  It is maliciously calculated to help brainwash White European men, women and our children to engage in race mixing - and it is intended to (a) reduce and eventually eliminate the production of White babies, and (b) to speed along the genocide of White European people.</p>

I would not be one bit surprised if underneath it all, the Black cop shot him to &#8220;even the score&#8221; concerning White cops/Black criminals.

<p>No mention of whether the police officer was taken off duty, etc.   &mdash;   no mention at all from the national media, of course, while they twist themselves into knots to portray Travon Martin as a sweet innocent kid gunned down by a bloody-thirsty WHITE vigilante out hunting non-Whites for fun and sport.</p>

<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, &#8220;hippies,&#8221; drugs and all, are a lot safer than blacks.  Woodstock was paradise so long as blacks weren&rsquo;t around.  Whosoever doubts this is either a nut, a Tea Partier or a neoconservative.    </p>

<p>The crowd was huge, an estimated 125,000 people stretching from the Washington Monument west to 17th Street NW. There were sporadic assaults early in the day, but the real violence didn&rsquo;t start until after Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>A 22-year-old man from Vienna was standing near the base of the monument when a group of men grabbed his wallet. He gave chase and was struck in the mouth with a club. An 18-year-old from Annapolis was jumped by a group of 20 teenagers who beat him and threw bottles at him until he was able to run to an ambulance. The worst injury was to Steven Laine, who was stabbed in his right eye while cutting across the Mall on his way home from work at the Agriculture Department.<br/>

I enlisted in the Army at age 18, green as grass, coming from a small Midwestern town where I&rsquo;d never had a moment&rsquo;s trouble with any of the black kids I went to school with. Three years of serving in the Army, stateside and Vietnam, with the &#8220;hoods from the hood&#8221; types, permanently soured me on blacks as a race. Although I&rsquo;ll have to add that I know several individual black people back here in my home town who I consider casual friends   &mdash;   and still have had no trouble with any of them here.

<p>The blacks at our mostly white school are usually nice and friendly, but don&rsquo;t make the mistake of lowering your guard.  If you ever find yourself in a place or situation where you&rsquo;re outnumbered by them, watch your back, and if possible, leave immediately.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they&rsquo;re observant enough to not be brainwashed by their kwaanza-celebrating, MLK-loving, white-guilt-mongering school district agenda.  They prefer the company of white people, even before I had never addressed the topic of race with them.</p>

<p>I remember a black girl saying that she thought whites acted like they owned the world.  ?  I thought that sounded a bit odd.  </p>
<p>I also remember going to boxing smokers in korea on military bases and hundreds of blacks would cheer the black boxing a korean or the black boxing any other race&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  it was an eye opener for me as I had never thought that way.  I suppose I do now after witnessing years filled with &#8216;eye openers&rsquo; about blacks.<br/>
Also in Korean, there seemed to occur every few months, some arrest or charges against a group of blacks who would rape a korean, or beat someone to a pulp or some other outrageous charge. <br/>
Also, in 1981, I believe it was. An incoming soldier went berserk on the rifle range and killed 4 whites and wounded several others.  Of course he was black.  This event never made the news in the US to my knowledge.  It was hushed up quickly in Korea.</p>

visited there. A great thing about a first world Asian country like Korea is that in most areas, you can go days, weeks, or even months without seeing a single black. If it weren&rsquo;t for the US military presence and corresponding high percentage of blacks on the Seoul base, the country would have no crime at all. And there is a high percentage of blacks precisely for that fact that Korea is not a war zone. They give them the easy &#8220;job&#8221; of doing nothing in Seoul (except committing crimes and causing problems) while young white men die in Iraq and Afghanistan). I have no idea why South Korea allows this base (Camp Blackhawk?) to remain. And I have even less of an idea why we spend money to keep it there. We have no troops on the Mexican border yet we keep the Korean base open to give blacks the chance to embarrass the USA while getting a military &#8220;vacation&#8221; in an otherwise crime free country. Utterly ridiculous.</p>

<p>At the time Itaewon had a lot of upmarket western-themed cafes/restaurants, eg the Oxford Club with a library theme.   Another was the &#8220;Gestapo Cafe&#8221;  inside were booths with murals depicting Hitler,  Mussolini, and SS men, etc.  At the top of the stairs as you entered was a mural of  a tall busty blonde in leather &#8220;SS&#8221; outfit wielding a whip.   Until recently I still had one of their box of matches with swastika&rsquo;s all over it. This was 1987.</p>
<p>I suspect the Korean owners had no idea how controversial this was - after all they&rsquo;d seen the war movies like we all have and assumed this was quite an acceptable theme.  I believe there were, at the time, only 200 jews in Korea. Nevertheless I think the English language media got onto their case and forced, or shamed them, into closing down.  </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-135893" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As with Rush Limbaugh, the personal life and the alleged romantic relationships of Ann Coulter leave something to be desired.  She is such a striking specimen, it is unfortunate she never settled down with some buff intelligent Navy SEAL or the like (white christian, of course) and had some kids.  I haven&rsquo;t read the book, but I&rsquo;ve read her columns for years, and I&rsquo;m betting she continues trying to fit a round peg in a square hole, which is to try to tie all resistance to black aggression and empowerment as a Democratic party matter.  It once might have been, but the Democrats have become marxists and abandoned their southern white members, who have jumped to the GOP by default.  She should be welcoming them and realizing that those cops with their dogs and firehoses had a lot more on the ball than the rest of the country gave them credit for.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136145" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think we have to agree to disagree.  Someone of her height and length of bone is going to look thinner than she is, and lanky is not emaciated.  What inspired me to write that was a couple of pictures David Yeagley used in his post about Ann Coulter being a Cherokee (tongue in cheek).  One of the photos was not even that flattering, yet stupendous.  In another, her features were such that N.C. Wyeth would have used her a a model for Helen of Troy.  But, de gustibus non disputandum est.</p>
<p>Although we should always be wary, I think it&rsquo;s great that Coulter has gone in this direction.  Perhaps some of the commentators here don&rsquo;t realize how many layers of cultural marxist bullcrap and absolute lies about history you have to dig yourself out of to get to race realism when you are from the north.  Just as William F. Buckley, Jr. ultimately left much to be desired as a voice for conservatism, if you got hooked on him, then you were likely exposed to Joe Sobran, which might lead to Sam Francis, and so on.  Even if Coulter herself views her book as a polemic intended to sway voters in the upcoming election, and nothing more, just bringing up the issues can only help.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136130" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> From my brief experience of watching the video clip of her on The View, I got the distinct impression that Coulter was trying to insinuate that the &#8216;Democrats&rsquo; are the real &#8216;racists&rsquo; and that the GOP actually loves blacks more and their policies have helped blacks more - over the long term, than have the income redistribution programs and welfare addictions that the Democrats have institutionalized within the black  community and overall mindset.</p>
<p>This reeks of the same kind of insane pandering to minorities that the establishment GOP has been doing for the last dozen or so election cycles, pandering which has yielded exactly zero positive results for the GOP and which has only served to nauseate their traditional white conservative base.   </p>
<p>I am a race realist, and therefore, I prefer to grab this race issue by the horns and speak bluntly about it.    The GOP, or more likely, the party that arises to take its place once the GOP finishes collapsing and being rendered obsolete (this can&rsquo;t happen soon enough to suit me) - needs to openly admit that they are not going to change or compromise their political positions and become more &#8216;liberal&rsquo; so as to accommodate the parasitical mindset and political preferences of blacks or any other minorities who want big government to take care of them from cradle to grave.   This new party must be openly and unapologetically pro-White and be emphatic about the fact that they intend to defend and promote the perfectly legitimate ethnic interests of White European Americans - and that they will NO LONGER allow their party or their constituencies to be race hustled by  con-artists like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, or self-hating White liberal weasels like Chrissy Matthews.   </p>

I&rsquo;ll make sure to read it. She was a guest on C-Span&rsquo;s morning interview and phone-in show the other day, and it was refreshing hearing her put certain callers in their place, as opposed to so many of the guests who will answer a hostile caller by saying something like, &#8220;Well, that&rsquo;s an excellent question, Joe,&#8221; or, &#8220;I certainly respect your right to your opinion &hellip;&#8221;, ad nauseum.

<p>Coulter is a little nuts but generally I agree with her views.  She did back down on the Bill Maher program.  Maher said something like, &#8220;are you suggesting blacks are more criminally inclined?&#8221;  and Coulter did not answer &#8220;Duh&hellip;.yes, do the words crime statistics mean anything to you?!&#8221;  like she should have.  Instead Coulter gave a pretty PC answer. </p>
<p>Of course Maher thinks all black crime is the fault of whites.  </p>

<p>But I agree with you, that point did not come across all that well. She will also make comments that seem to support Muslims from time to time. She really does come across as a liberal in some ways when she does that, but she, like most people today, conservatives included, are never ready to specifically say, Islam does not belong in the West, it is incompatible with freedom and democracy. Same for blacks, she sees them as just like whites except for the fact that white liberals have destroyed the black family (which is true) and caused many of the problems we see with blacks today. While liberals are to blame for much of it (the black family was much stronger BEFORE all the government rights programs kicked in the 60s) we still need to recognized some of the unique problems associated with the black race and functioning within civilization. </p>
<p>Whites are still in the process of giving away Western civilization. It will soon get to the point of no return, due to the presence of Islam within our borders, and too many non-white people from the third world.</p>

<p>Wrong.  Freedom destroyed the black family.  Blacks dipped their toe into White norms post-emancipation, mostly because Whites still knew their place in the world and blacks wanted to suck up, but that was a statistical anomaly, so to speak.  What we&rsquo;re seeing from blacks now is the norm, and what we saw then was the exception to the rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfair to say liberals did it, really, except insofar as liberals were the ones who gave blacks the freedom to be themselves, not understanding that the only way to get anything approaching satisfactory results from a black population is to run it like a boot camp.</p>

They had intact families, businesses, neighborhoods. Even Harlem was once good for them. Had liberals not intervened with the government programs chances are very good things would have continued as they were. But clearly you make a point, had they only been given equal rights, voting, etc., without any extra assistance from government programs, how would that have played out? Most likely much better. The destruction of the black family is really at the core of much of the problems we see today. The thugs are raised without fathers because the mothers are on goobermint assistance. That aspect of the problem is the biggest and most destructive.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136144" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Face reality as Taylor is no Coulter.  Taylors big drawback among many is his wussy pseudo intellectual  approach and mistaken mentality that by trying to paint himself as a liberal from Yale  born in Japland or being a white apologist without permission for NASCAR or the Symphony or other10s of 1000s of  white groups will somehow help his wild genetical inferior savag animal audiences understand his thinking. Wrong. Whites are still using blacks as their paid slaves and white female whores are laughably taking the dumb goons to the cleaners. Look at the jail cells where they are infected with aids and hiv. Thats no mistake. </p>
<p>So blacks always think whites are meeting and scheming ways to destroy them? Isnt that the idea? Dont they need to be intimidated? Let them think this in order to fear whites because whites are doing this secretly anyway for good reason. They have caught on to white tricks?<br/>
In reality whites are trying to figure out a way to contaminate their water supply too or put anthrax poison on their welfare checks in their mailboxes plus kill them with obesity from eating Big Macs and a host of other things such as dust their hoods from airplanes with contaminants or inject them with lethal viruses at the free clinics. Whites want them all dead.<br/>
And beware as whites dont show their anger and are non-emotional. They kill blacks in low level ways. hehehee&hellip; They infiltrate hoods with guns and drugs to kill them off. Blacks are easily tricked. They are dumber than hell. </p>
<p>You see we know since millions of blacks read AMREN and keep up with their enemy ( know thy enemy better than thy self) the only way blacks will ever really and truly live and be happy without the fear and threat of whites meeting together in white groups to eradicate them is to simply het on the next plane or boat and return to Africa and your roots and certainly not do what Chris Rock said to follow them everywhere they go unless you all have a death wish. heheheh &hellip;  Beware of the white dog nosed devils like Malcom X and Rev Wright said. Whites are armed to the teeth in the burbs and rural areas too. Beware. Never leave the big city concrete jungles or you will die or vanish.  We have you all in one place where we want you. hehehe &hellip;<br/>
This is so easy.  Beware, whites are everywhere all the time plotting the end of the black race and dont need public meetings. hehehe &hellip;<br/>
Africa is waiting for you to come home &hellip; better hurry back if you want to live in jungle bliss again &hellip; We devil whites are just playing with your brains now as entertainment. Look at sports and how you hurt each other. We like it. Look at how black on black crime kills 100k a year. We like it.  &hellip; Whites need entertainment &hellip;  If you go back whites will be bored as hell &hellip;. Dont go back to Africa, please stay so we can finish you off &hellip; hehehe</p>

It is the result. Blacks are a blight to civilization and a curse to any country that has a lot of them. They have contributed nothing to this country but popular songs. That does not begin to compensate for the damage they have done and continue to do. </p>

Amazon Yentas like Coulter use portions of undeniable facts, then spin the interpretations of those facts into something completely different or irrelevant than the premise that led to those facts.</p>
<p>The actual pro-White person who is attuned to Race sees that the racial dilemma we are currently experiencing is about the inability of the racial divide to be bridged without sacrificing our own White culture, heritage, DNA, national identity, and even safety.</p>
<p>Coulter, however, sees those pesky Liberals to be the hindrance to bridging the racial divide. She&rsquo;s not saying that it can&rsquo;t be done; she&rsquo;s saying that it can and should be done. That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>Two people speaking truths(one candidly, one more for profit) with diametrically opposed versions of why those truths matter.</p>

<p>The SPLC may recognize the truth.  Ann may be more with us than many here think.  She knows that people like Jared Taylor  are an &#8220;absolute non person to the MSM and publishing houses, so to be published and get on talk shows she has to disguise herself somewhat, and establish alibis to allow maximal exposure.  Of course she knows that the MSM have absolute control of access and much of public opinion.  This book goes as close to the line as is possible for her.  A limited association with Jimmy Walker is probably amusing and gives useful credentials, you know:  &#8220;Some of my best friends are&#8221;.  We should cut her some slack because she is getting the most exposure of someone who openly shares some of our veiws, that is currently possible.  </p>

Have her saying something that makes sense today, then when enough people get on board, have her totally change her position and embrace the brainwashing. It is an old technique, used by the commies for quite awhile now. Once she changes her positions then others feel the pressure to become &#8220;correct&#8221; as well. Once people make an emotional connection to a public figure then that public figure can lead many of them around by the nose. Remember, most people are followers. The only emotional connection one should have is to the truth. Don&rsquo;t put her on a pedestal and don&rsquo;t expect much from her. Race realists offer a counter movement, a sub culture. WE should concentrate on growing the numbers of that subculture. Anyone, even if they voice some of the same ideas, yet do not openly embrace the subculture, is someone who will one day work against us. They either are with us or against us. It really is that simple. Don&rsquo;t buy her book. Let the libs buy it, only see her as something to soften them up for an eventual conversion to the real truth.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;racism&#8221; has to be scrapped anyway, because if you accept that it is wrong to be &#8220;racist&#8221; then you imply that it would be wrong for whites to stand up for their own racial group.  Also, it makes it difficult to talk about inherent racial differences.  The only way to make the term &#8220;racist&#8221; non-harmful to our cause is to define it very narrowly, and this is just not realistic.  It is better to just scrap the term altogether.</p>

<p>Some etymologists make the case that the original term &#8220;racialism&#8221; (from about 1910) is actually the benign variety whereas &#8220;racism&#8221; was coined in the 1930&#8242;s in response to Nazism.  But it wouldn&rsquo;t work for us to re-surrect &#8220;racialism&#8221; as it is too similar to &#8220;racism&#8221; and today nobody everyone is so brainwashed that nobody bothers to consider there might be any difference, or that &#8220;racism&#8221; might have a benign or even benevolent side.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-137404" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good luck with that. An organization upon the board of which I once served tried valiantly but unsuccessfully to reclaim the word &#8220;eugenics&#8221;   &mdash;   which, after all, only means &#8220;sound breeding&#8221;!   &mdash;   by attaching to it modifiers like &#8220;neo-,&#8221; &#8220;individual&#8221; (as vs. &#8220;population-level&#8221;) and &#8220;voluntary&#8221; (as vs. &#8220;coercive&#8221;). It simply couldn&rsquo;t be done, any more than we could reclaim the term &#8220;discrimination&#8221;   &mdash;   which, after all, only means, &#8220;to recognize real differences between things and on that basis treat the different things differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>American English is fantastically, admirably robust over the long haul, but it is also almost preternaturally acquisitive in the short term. Once &#8220;Yanklish&#8221; borrows a word from another language or culture, as well as once it redefines words like the examples above, the new/redefined usage propagates through mass media with a speed and reach undreamed of even 50 years ago. Therefore it is my contention that striving to reclaim words THAT WE HAVE IN PRACTICE ALREADY LOST (&#8220;liberal,&#8221; anyone?) is an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>When and where will arise a new Breitbart, now that we need him more than ever? THERE was a man who fully understood that our current war is a MASS-MEDIA war, and we need to quit re-litigating terminological Nuremburgs and rather fight the war we&rsquo;ve got with the tools we&rsquo;ve got, whether or not they are seemly or classically correct!</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136365" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Many posts here are pure emotionalism. OK, I&rsquo;ll try to sum things up from my perspective:</p>
<p>1. here in Europe virtually no one has heard of Ann Coulter. She&rsquo;s non-entity.</p>
<p>2. most people seem to be enraged by her alleged sexual relations with some black old guy. It is not proven, and IMO it didn&rsquo;t happen. And even if it did, it has nothing to do with content of her book. Of course, I find the very idea repellent, but the story is about her book, not her personality or moral stature.</p>
<p>3. this book is, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen, something like &#8220;diluted race realism for dummies&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t forget, it&rsquo;s journalism, not a political program, and certainly not some historiosophical deep analysis. Not Rushton, Taylor, Francis, &hellip;</p>
<p>4. the merits of this book far outweigh its weaknesses. It is a pamphlet against white guilt &amp; liberal racial huckstering. Various cases (OJ, Christian-Newsome,.. ) are written about extensively. </p>
<p>So, IMO, &#8220;she once said that&#8221; &amp; &#8220;she didn&rsquo;t write about ..&#8221; objections are not valid. The main targets are white liberal treason &amp; media manipulation. Having this in mind, her latest book may be very important step in (some) white dummies&rsquo; awakening.</p>

<p>It can just as easily be stated that this book is a step in the right direction, right off a cliff. Make no mistake about it, Coulter is simply pimping her brand of a multiracial society. She cares about black-on-White crime as much as she does the thousands and thousands of dead and mutilated White soldiers who died for her GOP masters.</p>

South Africa is one of the LEAST fertile parts of Africa but produces the MOST food per capita, almost all by whites.   The only reason millions of Africans haven&rsquo;t starved is because whites send them free food (food aid).   <br/>
(and so on)</p>
<p>At this point they will argue that Africans just need &#8220;more education&#8221;, implying as usual that &#8220;its all whiteys fault&#8221;.   Ask them &#8220;is it your responsibility to educate someones else&rsquo;s children?&#8221;  By now they&rsquo;ve either changed the subject or called you a racist..!   </p>
<p>Unfortunately the media wont allow &#8220;racists&#8221;, even benign ones, make these points.  So all we can do is preach to the converted.    </p>

It is only then that white people wont consider the purpose of their lives to be the advancement of black people. It is only then that white people will be the masters of their own destiny yet again, instead of being chained to the black man. The word needs to be retaken. It is totally possible to do so. All that is necessary is for white people to not be afraid of the label.</p>

That book was not a race realist book. It was much like Coulter&rsquo;s book in that it pointed out the hypocrisy of the left in dealing with race.

<p>Coulter&rsquo;s book is not gateway literature.  It just reaffirms what mainstream conservatives already believe, and thus is useless at best.  At worst, it is a waste of time and energy for the mainstream conservatives who read it.  Mainstream conservatives get all hot and bothered about liberals, but they never realize that it is their own mental block against pro-white advocacy that empowers liberals.</p>

<p>It is way past time to try something different.  This stuff she is putting forward is old hat, and it has gotten us nowhere.  Conservatives have been insisting that they are not &#8220;racists&#8221; for decades.  Liberals keep accusing them of it, and conservatives keep responding reactively, saying &#8220;no we&rsquo;re not&#8221; without considering how repetitive things are getting.  Whites are becoming a minority and we still have official anti-white discrimination.</p>

<p>This brings up the subject of political barriers.  People on the racial right are almost never mentioned in mainstream conservatism.  The only exception I can think of off hand is Pat Buchanan mentioning Steve Sailer once.  Pat Buchanan writes gateway literature.  Ann Coulter doesn&rsquo;t.  Self-imposed barriers are a weakness.  This is why mainstream conservatism keeps getting dragged to the left.</p>
<p>If AmRen doesn&rsquo;t allow &#8220;NS&#8221; that raises the question of whether that is a weakness for AmRen.  I don&rsquo;t know the answer to this.</p>

Progeny(posterity) means of one&rsquo;s own RACE. Not a single White person (even these so-called pro-White advocates) ever admits that, do they?  So that leaves me to believe they are all cowards and traitors and full of fear. They would rather let their race die off or be genocided before they will ever speak the truth. Until they start speaking the truths I don&rsquo;t give a plugged nickel about any of them.</p>
