<h1 class="title">The Derbyshire/Weissberg Affair</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, April 12, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Feeding the beast only makes it stronger and more arrogant.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Just three days after <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295514/parting-ways-rich-lowry">firing</a> John Derbyshire as a National Review contributor, the magazine&rsquo;s editor Rich Lowry <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/295729/regarding-robert-weissberg-rich-lowry">announced</a> that Robert Weissberg was persona non grata, too. His crime? He &ldquo;participated in an <em>American Renaissance</em> conference where he delivered a noxious talk about the future of white nationalism.&rdquo; Prof. Weissberg said that any movement based on white racial identity is &ldquo;dead on arrival,&rdquo; but it seems that merely speaking at an AR conference is &ldquo;noxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lowry even thanked &mdash; yes, <em>thanked &mdash; </em>the people who called Prof. Weissberg&rsquo;s noxiousness to his attention. Who were they? Something that calls itself the Institute for Research &amp; Education on Human Rights (IREHR), one of those peeping-tom lefty organizations that issues breathless reports on the doings of &ldquo;racists.&rdquo; IREHR claims to investigate &ldquo;the smallest corners of white nationalist activity,&rdquo; which accounts for its April 5 write up that mentioned Prof. Weissberg.</p>
<p>There are, of course, no equivalent groups on the Right. No one makes a living snooping to see who once had lunch with a Weatherman or who bankrolls the New Black Panthers. There&rsquo;s no point to it because the Left does not recognize thought crimes on the Left and does not sacrifice its own. Unlike the Right, which is always terrified of what its enemies might say, the Left doesn&rsquo;t care. It doesn&rsquo;t let the Right make its policies and hiring decisions for it.</p>
<p>The Right could scream all it wanted that <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/02/obamas_weatherman_connection.html">William Ayers</a> admits he planted bombs and wishes he had planted more, but the University of Illinois-Chicago will never fire him as distinguished professor of education. It is impossible to imagine the university firing Prof. Ayers and then <em>thanking</em> the conservative snoop group that dug up the facts. But that is exactly what <em>National Review</em> did in the case of Prof. Weissberg. IREHR issued Mr. Lowry a cheeky but justified &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; after Mr. Lowry took its advice and cut off Prof. Weissberg.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these invertebrate &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; realize that cringing is fatal? As Mr. Derbyshire himself <a href="/news/2012/04/the-guillotining-of-john-derbyshire.html">points out</a>, &ldquo;the more you feed the beast, the stronger and more arrogant it grows.&rdquo; Any two-bit lefty with a blog can make <em>National Review</em> dance like a cat on a hot tin roof. The solution? Refuse to dance. So long as &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; keep dancing the Left will keep collecting thank-you notes.</p>
<p>Prof. Weissberg spoke at the AR conference on his own time. He never said a word about <em>National Review</em>, but Mr. Lowry has apparently absorbed lefty manias to the point that he thinks he has to police the conduct of his contributors 24 hours a day. There is dreary sport in imagining what else a contributor might have to do to get the Weissberg treatment. Get a summons for wife-beating? Be convicted of manslaughter? Get caught with a call girl? Advise the North Koreans on rocketry? Hard to say, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But take part in a conference with people who think that even white folks have legitimate interests as a group and you are no longer fit for polite company. This is especially contemptible coming from a magazine that claims it &ldquo;stands athwart history yelling Stop&rdquo; and that used to defend <a href="/ar/2000/09.html">the very positions</a> American Renaissance now takes.</p>
<p>NR made no friends by cutting off its smartest contributors. It earned the contempt of both its supporters <em>and </em>its enemies. The beast just wants more, and the beast will get more for precisely as long as &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; are content to be the lap-dog opposition and let their enemies tell them what they can and cannot say.</p>

Why is it that THEIR ideology, THEIR way of thinking, has to define the very DNA of mainstream discourse?. Why is it that even &#8220;Conservative&#8221; publications have to kow-tow to the leftist paradigm?.<br/>
I am, of course, being rhetorical; the answer, as most enlightened people know, is that the Left dominate the media, academia, &#8220;entertainment&#8221; industry, legal &#8220;profession&#8221;, and judiciary (which most times isn&rsquo;t very judicious, as the recent charging of George Zimmerman amply demonstrates).<br/>
So, considering that the Left are everywhere, and that the number of people who are &#8220;not like us&#8221; is very great, and are also everywhere, what is the solution?.<br/>
Is the solution peaceful and democratic; can the solution be achieved through reasoned argument, and &#8216;without a shot being fired&rsquo;?.<br/>
No.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-80034" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>More than likely, some kind of revolution will occur in our country when enough people get sick of all that is the mark of modern-day Liberalism/Leftism. What shape or to what degree it will take is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but I suspect it will not be pretty or without some bloodshed. The divisions that exist between us seem too great to be resolved merely by reasoned discourse - although I would hope for this avenue of approach rather than violence.  </p>
<p>Part of the reason the Left took over so many of our American institutions is because most of us were asleep. The average American is busy with the things of life - such as marriage, raising a family, securing a job and paying a mortgage. I think most of us are not intellectually inclined to think through the ideology and implications of Leftist dogma - and this is especially so within the past 20 years as we&rsquo;ve grown more &#8216;touchy-feely&rsquo; and anti-intellectual than ever. Moreover, the Left&rsquo;s thinking has influenced our culture and society incrementally, similar to the frog in the kettle which doesn&rsquo;t realize its grave circumstances until it&rsquo;s too late. Before we had even realized what occurred, each and every institution in America had been intellectually taken over by the Left. The result has been exactly what we see today in the attitudes of our youth, outright hostility toward traditional values and an anti-Western sentiment that pervades everything. I think we are witnessing the destruction of our Great Republic. </p>

<p> Perhaps someone needs to start another conservative magazine and blog which deals with race honestly and without fear, as does AmRen. NR used to be that way, but it&rsquo;s fallen by the wayside under the guidance of Mr. Lowry&rsquo;s &#8220;younger generation.&#8221;</p>

Boy do we ever need a nationalist party to emerge that will not cower and kowtow to the leftist race pimps and their incessant accusations of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and violations against diversity. The word conservative has been so perverted and distorted that we now have people like Rich Lowry masquerading as a &ldquo;conservative.&rdquo;<br/>

<p>Could not agree more.  As much as I love the Internet, I still think there is a place for print magazines and that it was a mistake to close down the AR&rsquo;s monthly paper version.  I felt that it had articles that were often too long for the internet, but maybe I am wrong here and no nothing about the realities of publishing.   We have the blog of AmRen, but need a magazine that is on the newstands.</p>

<p>Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s network of activists does precisely what Mr. Taylor denies the right does - snoop undercover in the underbelly of the left to sniff out scandal and extremism.   That&rsquo;s what James O&rsquo;Keefe does full time, for pay.</p>
<p>And Shirley Sherrod, Van Jones, and most recently Hillary Rosen can testify that the Left does indeed disavow and even fire people who embarrass it by going too far for Middle America.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll admit this is a relatively new phenomenon, one caused by the Right at long last giving the Left a taste of its own medicine.  But it does exist.</p>

<p> The same can be said for a few apologists even here on many of  the Amren articles  who remind me of those neoconservatives who &#8220;took over&#8221; the real conservatives.   They don&rsquo;t sound like racially aware Whites EXCEPT when it comes to posting about blacks. Other nonwhites and their threat ALSO  to White survival, seem to get a free pass from these posters. Some want them to &#8220;join us&#8221; as ONE. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-81705" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Anti-racism is the idea to pacify the humanity by mixing all races but is in practice the elimination of the white race only and participates to the humanity&rsquo;s self destruction processes. It is a form of biopolitics to which we oppose something expressed by Guillaume Faye approximately as: &#8220;Do no ask why we fight, but for whom.&#8221; When we imagine our peoples, we don&rsquo;t pay much attention to what people think, what they do, to which gods they prey, and, this is central, who they take in as long as all this do not endanger their existence and genetic integrity. As white men, for a great deal, our motivation is that the beauty of our women remains as it is and that they are not taken away by men of other races. A few hundred years ago, we would have no need to rationalize about this as we do today, where auto-genocidal ideas have taken place among us and politics of miscegenation are actually implemented. Against us may have been a misinterpretation of Darwin&rsquo;s teachings which, beside accentuating international competition on the one end, has fractured the society and opposed to the mistake that all men are equal those that a man exists by himself. It is not true that life has a purpose, it is simply what remains. There is no teleological will of survival; moral is a product of life and not the other way round. Hence, live is not without moral but also beauty and true, and all of this will always blossom anew, but only from what still is and who we are; we are traditionalist and conservative in the biological sense. Also, in someway, because they differ in their nature, selfishness is not in all cases the opposite of altruism.</p>
<p>To escape in the one peoples Utopia or to affirm the world with its multitude of peoples is a matter of yes or no, but, while soil and blood are both necessary, our preference for peace and fertility, for the invariability of blood over the invariability of soil needs measure and steadiness in its implementation. Mr Derbyshire has married outside his race and his descents will have no place on the soil where we will live. People of mixed descend are tempted by the party invariability of soil above invariability of blood but may still join our cause, even when not sharing the same territory, because the old races have precedence over the mixed ones: A mixed race can be reborn from the old race but not the other way round. Mr Weissberg as Jew will also have no place on the soil where we will live. The Jews have choose to be a people for they own. Maybe they are mixed with an old race that has died and cannot be reborn, and therefore must have their own destiny. Maybe some are whites and can return to their motherland if they forget to be Jew. However, the rule of the old living white races is to keep their blood clean so that they can differ, and finally divide even themselves as life commands to do. Because when they divide, they must choose who belong to them and who not, and because the freedom of association is the mother of all freedoms, life commands whites to be free.</p>
