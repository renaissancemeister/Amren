<h1 class="title">Atlantic Wire Can&rsquo;t Get Enough of John Derbyshire</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, April 9, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
. . . and gets the prize for lazy journalism.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Atlantic Wire can&rsquo;t get enough of John Derbyshire. On April 6, Elspeth Reeve wondered why he had not yet been fired for his Takimag.com essay of just the day before, and complained that he is the <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/04/why-john-derbyshire-hasnt-been-fired-yet/50803/">test case</a> for showing &ldquo;how racist you can be and still get published by people who consider themselves intellectuals.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know if the editors of <em>National Review</em> consider themselves &ldquo;intellectuals,&rdquo; but the implication is that anything to their Right should not even make a pretense of intelligence or a concern for facts. Poor Miss Reeve. She has the entire Internet before her, yet doesn&rsquo;t seem to have dipped more than half a toe into it.</p>
<p>Today, she is back at Atlantic Wire, with some of the laziest journalism I have seen in a long time. In a piece with the awkward title, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/04/here-are-racists-sad-see-derbyshire-go/50895/">Here Are the Racists Sad to See Derbyshire Go,</a>&rdquo; she tells us that &ldquo;white supremacists are rallying to John Derbyshire&rsquo;s side, but not without reservations.&rdquo; Whence this insight? She briefly quotes from <a href="/news/2012/04/why-derbyshire-had-to-go.html">my article</a> about Mr. Derbyshire, but most of her column consists of selective quotes from among the hundreds of reader comments about Mr. Derbyshire at AmRen.com, and at FreeRepublic.com.</p>
<p>We and FreeRepublic are apparently the gold standard for taking the temperature of the &ldquo;white supremacists.&rdquo; This is news to us, just as it must be to FreeRepublic. As even Miss Reeve&rsquo;s commenters have explained to her, most AmRen readers consider the evidence overwhelming that North Asians and Ashkenazi Jews have higher IQs than gentile whites. I wonder just what she thinks a &ldquo;white supremacist&rdquo; might be.</p>
<p>Miss Reeve also confessed herself baffled as to why anyone would refer to blacks as &ldquo;Holder&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; but once again, her readers are better informed than she. A commenter explained that it is because Eric Holder, attorney general of the United States and therefore presumably the top legal officer for all Americans, refers to blacks as &ldquo;my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Reeve noted that I had referred to the double standard that means people can say all manner of rude things about whites without fear of punishment while Mr. Derbyshire is out the door for a few home truths about blacks. One of my examples of rude things said about whites was Noel Ignatiev&rsquo;s famous call to &ldquo;abolish the white race,&rdquo; but Miss Reeves had never heard of that. She complained that I had not cited a reference, implying that I must have made up the quote. Poor Miss Reeve; never heard of Google, I suppose.</p>
<p>In its day, <em>Atlantic</em> had a well deserved reputation for well researched journalism and careful fact-checking. Real writers such as James Fallows still write for the magazine but it must have fallen on awfully hard times if it must settle for obvious second-raters such as Elspeth Reeve.</p>

<p>Whites are the only group of people in America (actually, the world) who cannot force an apology out of anyone, no matter how grave the offense.  </p>
<p>Even a statement as innocuous as &#8220;Whites are people, too, you know!&#8221; startles people.  (Whites are seen as pieces of meat, with no natural interests of their own, only there to satisfy ever other group&rsquo;s needs, which is presumably just the way Elspeth Reeves would have it.)</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78893" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>MANIFESTO FOR  A NEW RACE RELATIONS (Please feel free to<br/>
circulate)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fundamental problem<br/>
of racial race relations in the US is the absence of reciprocity between blacks<br/>
and whites.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the<br/>
fact that whites are not permitted to have an identity as whites in relation to<br/>
other races, but are taught to hate ourselves and assume universal guilt for<br/>
essentially everything wrong with the world, there is no possibility of whites<br/>
collectively articulating their demands in relation to blacks.</p>
<p>Under this bizarre set of<br/>
circumstances, the question: </p>
<p>&#8220;What are the demands of<br/>
the white community in relation to the black community?&#8221; </p>
<p>cannot be asked, because<br/>
it is unthinkable.</p>
<p>And yet, without<br/>
reciprocity – without blacks understanding that something is required of them in<br/>
return for the sacrifices whites have made on their behalf over the past<br/>
century and more – there is no possibility of a healthy relationship developing<br/>
between the races.</p>
<p>As Marcel Mauss pointed<br/>
out in his classic The Gift, to<br/>
receive without reciprocity, without anything being expected return, is<br/>
degrading, demeaning, and dehumanizing.</p>
<p>The relationship between<br/>
blacks and whites in the US is based on the principle that whites must do X, Y<br/>
and Z for blacks, and that in return, blacks must castigate whites for doing<br/>
too little, for past crimes, for systemic racism, continuing discrimination,<br/>
etc. etc. The guilt experienced by whites is never diminished, the demands by<br/>
blacks continue to escalate, and this dysfunctional relationship worsens.</p>
<p>The virtually<br/>
totalitarian levels of censorship faced by whites when it comes to race issues<br/>
means that their resentments seethe in private; black demands are routinely<br/>
met with meekness and humility, and yet black rage continues to escalate, and<br/>
the black community continues to languishes in dysfunction and pathology.</p>
<p>Missing from this<br/>
equation are two elements:</p>
<p>What are the obligations<br/>
felt by blacks in relation to whites?</p>
<p>What dowhites have<br/>
a right to expect from blacks in return for their sacrifices?</p>
<p>Again, since there is no<br/>
possibility within the current discourse of specifically white position<br/>
articulating itself in the public realm, these questions remain simply unthinkable.</p>
<p>What has really crippled<br/>
race relations in the United States is not &ldquo;systemic racism,&rdquo; prejudice, or &ldquo;continued<br/>
discrimination,&rdquo; it is the ABSENCE OF RECIPROCITY, which is the foundation of<br/>
any healthy (individual or group) relationship.</p>
<p>In order for this<br/>
reciprocity between blacks and whites to develop, white America must ARTICULATE<br/>
A CLEAR COLLECTIVE POSITION in relation to blacks (and the other races), and as<br/>
a precondition, this requires that whites must develop a positive and<br/>
affirmative identity for themselves as a community – again, something strictly forbidden<br/>
in the current political discourse.</p>
<p>By becoming permanent clients<br/>
of the state, by being held too much lower standards than whites in education<br/>
and employment, blacks have been accommodated, but at the same time<br/>
disempowered.</p>
<p>In the absence of<br/>
reciprocity, this relationship can only be between inferiors and superiors, (out<br/>
of control) child and (neurotic, indulgent) parent.</p>
<p>In order for blacks and<br/>
whites to develop healthy relationship, whites must assert an affirmative group<br/>
identity, and must convey to blacks clear and ambiguous demands (e.g., an<br/>
immediate 90% reduction in black on white violence in the United States; official<br/>
acknowledgment of the sacrifices whites have made on behalf of blacks; a<br/>
moratorium on race quotas until an open national debate has been held on the<br/>
issue, etc.). </p>

Without her diligence, the Army would still be breaking protocol and subjecting soldiers with depression to ridiculous practices like wearing orange construction vests all over base. These practices existed only to punish those wise enough to admit that they needed help, rather than help them. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if her actions directly contributed to saving a few lives out there. Mrs. Reeve, if you&rsquo;re reading this, that young army private from Fort Benning that you interviewed 3 years ago still thanks you.</p>
