<h1 class="title">The Guillotining of John Derbyshire</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Alex Kurtagic, American Renaissance, April 12, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
His thoughts after the blade.</div> 
</div> 


<p>John Derbyshire&rsquo;s <a href="http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire#axzz1rnVTJ0B8">&ldquo;Talk&rdquo; column</a> for <em>Takimag</em> last week detonated the ire of commentators on the lunatic fringes of the extreme Left. Ulcers flared and torrents of bile swamped the internet. The roar was even heard across the Atlantic, as the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/08/john-derbyshire-fired-article-african-americans">weighed in</a>, wondering on Sunday why Mr. Derbyshire&rsquo;s piece was still online. By Monday I was perplexed to find that, amidst the still raging sandstorm of prose, not one journalist or commentator had sought Mr. Derbyshire for comment (though Gawker finally published an interview later that day). What follows is my effort to rectify this omission.</p>
<p>AK: Observers who rely on conventional opinion websites and news sources may wonder how it is that a well-educated, well-traveled, intelligent mathematician, author, and commentator, able to write on a broad range of political-cultural topics, can have heterodox perspectives on human biodiversity and race relations. Surely, &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is the product of ignorance.</p>
<p>JD: When the orthodox opinions are arrant nonsense, how can a well-educated, etc. person NOT be heterodox. &#8220;There is no biological reality corresponding to &#8216;race&rsquo; &#8220;? Please. I guess there are no <a href="../../../wiki/File_Short-haired-Dachshund.jpg">Dachshunds</a> or <a href="../../../wiki/File_SanBernardo_Newton.jpg">St. Bernards</a>, either, only dogs. This is infantile.</p>
<p>AK: It seems conservative commentators viewed your column as diverging from their fundamental outlook. Why have they not expressed to you &mdash; or indeed the world &mdash; the joy of living in all-black neighborhoods? At least some of them must have been eager to share their delight at their kids&rsquo; academic performance in that all-black school they enrolled them in last fall.</p>
<p>JD: As I <a href="http://gawker.com/5900452/i-may-give-up-writing-and-work-as-a-butler-interview-with-john-derbyshire">told</a> Gawker.com I think it&rsquo;s just intolerable despair. &#8220;<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/tseliot107488.html">Humankind cannot bear very much reality</a>.&#8221; Fifty years ago it was possible to believe that blacks could be lifted up to statistical profiles on behavior, intelligence, etc. indistinguishable from those of whites. All we had to do was strike down unjust laws and give a helping hand (affirmative action, set-asides, etc.)</p>
<p>What all that actually accomplished was to open glorious career opportunities for blacks who are smart and well-adjusted to bourgeois norms, while leaving the rest <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2069/housing-bubble-subprime-mortgages-hispanics-blacks-household-wealth-disparity">worse off &mdash; in e.g. employment, comparative net worth, illegitimacy, incarceration &mdash; than before</a>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in their brains, all whites know this. That&rsquo;s why their brains steer them to the avoidance behavior you noted, and I recommended. That&rsquo;s the automatic part of the brain, though; what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334187683&amp;sr=1-1http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334187683&amp;sr=1-1">Kahneman calls System 1</a>. The self-aware System 2 is much more concerned with social cataloging and status-assessing, and with <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/social_psychological_narrative">making up stories</a> to present ourselves to ourselves and to others as acceptable members of the tribe. When reality is too painful to bear, we make stuff up.</p>
<p>AK: Also, I have not yet seen a refutation to the points made in your column &mdash; have I been visiting the wrong websites?</p>
<p>JD: Why would anyone bother to engage in argument with a RACIST? That would just <em>legitimize</em> their RACISM. To want to do that would be the next worst thing to being a RACIST oneself.</p>
<p>AK: Fellow <em>NR</em> columnist Robert Weissberg was &ldquo;fired&rdquo; on Tuesday night for his participation in the recent AmRen conference.</p>
<p>JD: Disclosure: Bob, as well as being a brilliant man and author of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bad-Students-Not-Schools/dp/141281345X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334188020&amp;sr=1-1">fine book</a> (some trivial mathematical errors notwithstanding), is a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>AK: Writing for Leonard Zeskind&rsquo;s grim IREHR, Devin Burghart wrote &ldquo;the positions taken by Robert Weissberg are as noxious as those of Derbyshire.&rdquo; Twelve hours later, <em>NR</em> editor Rich Lowry explained Weissberg&rsquo;s firing in this manner: &ldquo;Robert Weissberg . . . participated in an American Renaissance conference where he delivered a noxious talk.&rdquo; Is it normal for a conservative editor to get his language and opinions from a commentator on the extreme Left?</p>
<p>JD: Rich Lowry has cut me a lot of slack in the past, so I&rsquo;ll cut him some. He wants his magazine to be a certain particular thing, appealing to a certain political market sector. If you or I were editor of a political magazine, we would not want our organ to be that thing appealing to those readers. But then, we wouldn&rsquo;t want it to resemble <em>Field &amp; Stream</em>, either. It&rsquo;s an editor&rsquo;s job to steer his magazine in what he thinks is the right direction. If Rich is mistaken about that market sector being sufficient to support that magazine, the miracle of the market will enlighten him. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%99%BE%E8%8A%B1%E9%BD%8A%E6%94%BE%EF%BC%8C%E7%99%BE%E5%AE%B6%E7%88%AD%E9%B3%B4">Let a hundred flowers bloom</a>.</p>
<p>AK: The purges of Sam Francis, Peter Brimelow, Joe Sobran, yourself, and other brilliant columnists have all been driven by a desire for respectability. However, far from attaining it, this has led to a loss of respect from the Right and no increase in respect from the Left &mdash; on the contrary, one may say that respect from the Left has sunk even lower, since they have learned that conservatives will instantly cave in when accused of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JD: Mark Steyn made the same point in his <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295591/re-derb-mark-steyn">comment on my defenestration</a>. The more you feed the beast, the stronger and more arrogant it grows. Mainstream conservatives are fools to keep feeding it, but they apparently can&rsquo;t help themselves. Now it may be too strong to defeat. Then we are headed into totalitarianism, because the Left is totalitarian like <a href="http://www.aesopfables.com/cgi/aesop1.cgi?4&amp;TheScorpionandtheFrog">the scorpion in Aesop</a> is a scorpion: they can&rsquo;t help themselves either.</p>
<p>At a panel discussion on an <em>NR</em> cruise last year I pooh-poohed something Rich Lowry said about the achievements of conservatism. The movement (I said) had started out with the ambition to stand athwart History crying &#8220;Stop!&#8221; It had degenerated into a pathetic, timid pack of losers running along behind History calling out &#8220;Would you please mind slowing down just a little?&#8221;  (Roissy expresses the same idea somewhat more . . . <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/bad-news-for-smart-nerds/#comment-328351">pungently</a> in this comment thread on one of his pieces.) That got good applause from the hall, which ignited a flicker of hope in my breast.</p>
<p>My hope is that this timid, careerist conservatism that scurries to obey when some bigfoot leftist cracks the whip, will soon come to be seen as a faction of losers, which of course they are. Americans hate a loser, so that will be the end of them. I do think this will likely happen, and that there&rsquo;s some creative destruction up ahead in the conservative movement.</p>
<p>On the other side is my dear friend Paul Gottfried, who thinks the war is lost, that the beast is now too strong to be defeated &mdash; that we on the oppositional right are the losers &mdash; what the late Sam Francis called us 20 years ago:  &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Losers-Failure-American-Conservatism/dp/0826209769">Beautiful Losers</a>.&#8221; Pat Buchanan has pretty much reached the same position. I retain some shreds of optimism <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Are-Doomed-Reclaiming-Conservative-Pessimism/dp/0307409597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334189748&amp;sr=1-1">(!)</a>, but I feel a strong gravitational pull coming from Paul&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>The future evolution of American conservatism is at any rate going to be very interesting.</p>
<p>AK: Perhaps I have not understood conservatism correctly, but &mdash; isn&rsquo;t conservatism supposed to be about the data and not about how people feel about it?</p>
<p>JD: Permit me to quote from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Are-Doomed-Reclaiming-Conservative-Pessimism/dp/0307409597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334194309&amp;sr=1-1">book of mine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Discussing the thesis of my book with one of my friends &mdash; a conservative academic (political science) &mdash; I encountered total disagreement.  He:  &#8221;There&rsquo;s nothing about traditional conservatism that makes it truth-friendly. In fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite. Historic conservatism is anti-science, prone to celebrate truth by authority, favors religion over rationalism and down deep sees unvarnished truth as corroding social cohesion &mdash; correctly, according to you. Keep the peasants happy with fairy tales and mumbo-jumbo, if necessary.&#8221; [That was actually the aforementioned Bob Weissberg.]</p></blockquote>
<p>AK: Is it not more bound with notions of honor, the martial spirit, and glory, than with a desire to be liked by everyone?</p>
<p>JD: Those notions have passed from the earth, Alex, or at least from Western Civilization. &#8220;Martial spirit&#8221;? For goodness&rsquo; sake, somebody might get <em>hurt</em>.</p>
<p>AK: Where are today&rsquo;s conservatives in the political spectrum?</p>
<p>JD: To the left of a tad right of the center. Lower taxes! Ban abortion!</p>
<p>AK: What is it like to be on your side of the cannon when &ldquo;racism&rdquo; controversies arise?</p>
<p>JD: Nature blessed me with a thick skin. More recently, she cursed me with a life-threatening condition, beside which these tiny internet controversies (my particular one has not made it into any print newspaper or the teleprompt of any TV talking head, to my knowledge) seem pretty trivial. Which, in point of fact, they are.</p>
<p>AK: What expressions of support have your received since commentary on your column first appeared?</p>
<p>JD: Simply tremendous! See the opening grafs of my <em>Takimag</em> <a href="http://takimag.com/article/talking_back_john_derbyshire#axzz1rq8UV3gy">column</a> today, April 12, where I declare myself &#8220;awash in the milk of human kindness.&#8221; Wonderful, miraculous support, marred only by the sure and certain knowledge that I could never acknowledge every single email and donation, if I did nothing else for a month. Bless them all.</p>
<p>AK: In the past, critics would have placed your nape under the guillotine and held your severed head aloft for the delectation of the multitude. Now they will have to make do with the hope that you will spend the rest of your days in abject poverty, sleeping rough and queuing in soup kitchens, completely forgotten. Maybe they dream you&rsquo;ll end up like Bobby Driscoll, abandoned by all, your skeleton found years later in an abandoned tenement in a big city slum. Will their cruelty be gratified?</p>
<p>JD: Probably. Have you ever been in an old folks home? Helped nurse an Alzheimer&rsquo;s or stroke patient? I have done all three. The opinion journalist I most admired in my young adulthood was Bernard Levin. He ended up drooling and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Levin#Last_years">diapers</a>. But Doctor Johnson told us all this 263 years ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/vanity.html">From <em>Marlb&rsquo;rough</em>&#8216;s Eyes the Streams of Dotage flow,</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/vanity.html">And <em>Swift</em> expires a Driv&rsquo;ler and a Show.</a></p>
<p>And he was imitating Juvenal, who told the tale 1600 years earlier:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/satura10.html">sed quam continuis et quantis longa senectus</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/satura10.html">plena malis! . . .</a></p>
<p>. . . and Juvenal took his theme in part from Herodotus, writing six centuries before (the <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.1.i.html">Solon-Croesus exchanges</a>) The theme was probably common enough in the Paleolithic. Perhaps even chimps know about it.</p>
<p>Not many of us end well. My hero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Like-Roman-Powell-Phoenix-Giants/dp/075380820X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334191153&amp;sr=1-1">Enoch Powell</a> was asked in his old age if he had any regrets. He said yes, he regretted not having died fighting in WW2. I am of the same kidney, except for not having had a war to die honorably in. (Powell, by the way, knew his Herodotus. In fact he published a quirky translation of the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-History-Herodotus-Enoch-Powell/dp/B004I0VBHO/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334191253&amp;sr=1-2">Histories</a></em>, all done in 17th-century KJV English &mdash; well worth a look.)</p>
<p>I preach &#8220;that odd defiant melancholy that sees the dreadful loneliness of the human soul and the pitiful disaster of human life as ever redeemable and redeemed by compassion, friendship and love.&#8221; (I am quoting from a different <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Books/Fire/page.html">one of my books</a> &mdash; hope that&rsquo;s OK.)</p>
<p>All of that, of course, applies just as well to the young lefty fools who are currently jumping up on chairs and shrieking at the mouse in the room. <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Culture/fogeysrevenge.html#consolation">I have argued elsewhere</a>, in fact, that it will probably apply to their generation with greater force than to mine. I cherish the sweet thought.</p>

<p>I agree with Derb that conservatism isn&rsquo;t about data.  Data is about data, I suppose.  Facts exist, but most of the political disagreement is over the same sort of data and facts.  Even being a racial realist isn&rsquo;t the same as being a white racial conservative.  Race realists argue that the empirical data (crime rate statistics, IQ scores, bio-physical attributes) distinguish groups of people into what are called (scientifically or unscientifically) races.  However, a liberal can rationally accept these data as well.  In fact, I would argue a liberal could support his arguments *using* these facts.  If blacks, on average, have lower impulse control and a lower IQ, why couldn&rsquo;t a liberal point to these facts in arguing for affirmative action and a generous welfare state?  In order to equalize income (between whites and blacks) that won&rsquo;t occur in a free market, we need government intervention.</p>
<p>What makes us racial conservatives is that the above suggestion (equalizing incomes) is ludicrous.  Whites founded the United States by fighting for its independence, white pioneers tamed the land and the savage natives which lived in it, white industrialists helped develop the country&rsquo;s economy and move it from agrarian-based to one which was able to develop uses for electricity, the automobile, the airplane, the submarine, the television, the radio, the internet, etc.  Whites deserve the autonomy and self-governance that other civilizations have been able to maintain, and the racial minorities which are able to share (even somewhat) in the wealth of the nation should be thankful for their opportunity, given where their cousins are today.  </p>

Race realists argue that the empirical data (crime rate statistics, IQ scores, bio-physical attributes) distinguish groups of people into what are called (scientifically or unscientifically) races. However, a liberal can rationally accept these data as well. In fact, I would argue a liberal could support his arguments *using* these facts. If blacks, on average, have lower impulse control and a lower IQ, why couldn&rsquo;t a liberal point to these facts in arguing for affirmative action and a generous welfare state? In order to equalize income (between whites and blacks) that won&rsquo;t occur in a free market, we need government intervention.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Point Blank:  Aesthetics trump facts.  Fine.  Here&rsquo;s my preference for preferences sake:  Blacks number 13% of this society.  Even after the sad truth of white infertility in the mid-21st comes along to to slap us in the face with 35% population numbers corresponding to &#8216;having it all&rsquo; (and giving it our future) in a single generation; we will -still- outnumber blacks by at least 1.5:1 (blacks moving up to 20% of population).</p>
<p>If whites want their own society as their own right to associate with whom they please, they need no more than that justification.</p>
<p>Because that is -all- (aesthetics of emotional appeal) that liberals have on their side.  And democracy is about the best for the most and simple subsistence for the rest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s where the destruction of white American is and the race to &#8216;government intervention&rsquo; by perhaps 3-10% of this nations total population (yes, we all KNOW who the universalist/globalist group are) is going to end up _killing us all_.</p>
<p>Because, across the world, non-whites have NEVER LEARNED how to contain their population numbers.  Only the fact that they have lived in such hellish environments as India, Africa and China have kept their populations in check.</p>
<p>Import those peoples here and soon there will be no whites.  We will be lost like the Aryans who came down into Pakistan and Northern India and were -swamped-, within less than 10 generations.  Their DNA lost.  Their special attributes vanished forever within the sweltering masses that have continued to live backward lives to this day.  Giving us such wondrous examples as the slums of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Why cannot liberals realize that -we- are the rare and unusual ones?  Why can they not fight for the REAL population-percentage underdogs who are deserving of a hand up?</p>
<p>They must be the ones stuck in label land where &#8216;conservative&rsquo; = &#8216;diametrically appositional&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Either that or they truly are so evil that they wish us dead.  For no better reason than that they hate their own.</p>

<p>As it stands now, it is East Asians first (1.4 to 1. 5 billion), then whites (1.2 billion).</p>
<p>Whites outnumber sub-Saharan Africans by about 200 to 300 million.</p>
<p>Europe is the world&rsquo;s most densely populated continent. Not Asia.</p>
<p>It is East Asian countries who now have the lowest fertility rates in the world, and East Asians have the lowest fertilities in the US.</p>
<p>So it seems that when Chinese and Japanese are in the same kind of socio-economic environment as whites, they have <i>lower</i> levels of fertility.</p>

<p>The Han bump up against much higher population densities before they reign themselves in.</p>
<p>Asia&rsquo;s interior is sparsely populated, because it&rsquo;s not very hospitable, with an arid, continental climate.  Then there&rsquo;s Siberia, most of which isn&rsquo;t an improvement AFAIK.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-80647" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>American conservatism is, or was, at least, somewhat different from the European varieties, much closer to what is now called conservative libertarian, for a good view see Mario Pei&rsquo;s 1964 collection of essays <i>The America We Lost: The Concerns of a Conservative</i>.  In my opinion, the correct relationship between American conservatism and facts is a courageous determination to face the facts, whatever they may be or lead.</p>
<p>That is one of the keystones of real conservatism, sticking to what has traditionally worked, even when you think you have a better way.  After all, you may be wrong, where history has shown what has worked.  You improve society and yourself incrementally, not by jumping off the building because you suddenly &#8220;realized&#8221; you can fly.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-83065" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Unfortunately, many Americans who call themselves &#8220;conservatives&#8221; advocate policies that have failed in the past, or radical policies that have never been tried.<br/>
 <br/>
During his campaign in 1980 Ronald Reagan said he could cut taxes, raise defense spending, and balance the budget &#8220;by 1983 if not sooner.&#8221; He said nothing about cutting popular middle class entitlements, business subsidies, or farm subsidies. He cut the top tax rate, and increased military spending. The national debt more than tripled. Nevertheless, conservatives continue to tout the revenue building benefits of tax cuts.<br/>
 <br/>
It is natural to allow one&rsquo;s likes and dislikes to influence one&rsquo;s judgment of what is true and false. Nevertheless, one should recognize this tendency in oneself, and try to avoid it. Conservatives allow their hatred of taxes to imagine benefits that have been proven to be illusory. </p>

<p>&gt;<br/>
One thing I can say though is that the conservative movement (kind of like bowel movements at this point) has GOT to STOP making these burnt offerings to the liberal determiners of what is or is not verboten! &gt;</p>
<p>A man stands up in a crowd cheering on the destruction of it&rsquo;s own kind and says: &#8220;Uhhh, wait, we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this to ourselves&hellip;&#8221;.  And the crowd screams him down.  And he says:  &#8220;Oh I&rsquo;m so sorry!  Racist moment there, I&rsquo;ll be good now!&#8221;</p>
<p>What this tells you is two things:<br/>
1.  We have lost.  Because the whites who are making these statements are looking for a base of support that doesn&rsquo;t exist.  And when it&rsquo;s clear that &#8216;it&rsquo;s not here&rsquo; they try to take back the statement rather than be denied the right to speak &#8216;later, when you see I was right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>2.   We have lost.  Because it&rsquo;s reached the point where anti-white racists can now have people removed from the very sites they have become known for speaking from.  Like a crowd removing the veritable soap box from under a speaker&rsquo;s feet.  So that -no- forum of equal rights for all can be given.</p>
<p>And people who are secretly &#8216;hopeful&rsquo; or &#8216;cheerful&rsquo; at this (as if the societal herd will know or notice what they did not care to agree with, before.) are in fact themselves suffering from the equally demented belief that accompanies all suicides:  That someone will wake up and realize what they&rsquo;ve lost, after it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>The only way such an effect will happen will be when the global economy, based on differential profit from virtual work product (1s and 0s as dollars and cents, not real production) crashes and we are all left, once more isolated, in our own terrain isolates.</p>
<p>The problem with this is simple.  Whites will go below 4% population by 2100.  And with seed populations of blacks, asians and SWA&rsquo;s on all white continents whose TFR blooms whenever it can, even if it means locusting off our _hard_ work, we will be overrun and driven to genetic oblivion.  Before the descent to entropic reset.</p>
<p>NPI Population Stats<br/>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6pzPp1Q2ew" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6pzPp1Q2ew</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just a matter of whether humanity crashes as a first world culture before the global resource pool dries up.  Or after.  But whites will have lost everything by then.  No mater what.</p>
<p>Our only hope is secession and separation into white run super majority states whose -explicit- working condition is one of racial excluionism.  Just like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, China, India, Japan and Israel.</p>
<p>Forget the U.S..  The U.S. no longer listens to us.  We The People.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Rocky.  He&rsquo;s not writing to you or me.  We don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just another intellectual who, although he speaks truth about racialism, blacks, etc, is no more like most of US than he is like Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Actually, he has more in common with Obama that with any of us.</p>
<p>Our movement is full of these people.  Everyone wants to be a white collar revolutionary . . . no one wants to put on a jeans and a t-shirt, grab a pitchfork and get down and dirty.</p>

The fact that 3/4th asian 1/4th whites look entirely asian, while the majority of 3/4 white 1/4th asians still have very visible Mongoloid features demonstrates just how one-sided European/East Asian race-mixing really is. It&rsquo;s the same with European/Negroid mixing.</p>
<p>Asians/Blacks can afford to take the hit from race-mixing in the short-run while whites cannot as Asian/Black genes are far more dominant. Get it?</p>
<p>The Spaniards tried it before with the Mestizos, remember? It failed then and it will also fail now.</p>
<p>By mixing with Asians, you are increasing the Mongoloid population while simultaneously causing a proportionate decline in the Caucasoid population. The same thing happens with Negroids.</p>

<p>I think we all (racial conservatives) get to a point where we decide nuance isn&rsquo;t worth it anymore.  Even though Derb stated clearly that not all blacks are miserable people, those who couldn&rsquo;t handle the truth acted as if he&rsquo;d said that all blacks are violent, murderous thugs.  The opposing claim to the egalitarian paradigm &#8220;there is no such thing as race&#8221; isn&rsquo;t &#8220;race exists and each race is 100% different from each other&#8221; but &#8220;race exists and has a large impact on social structure and individual behavior in human civilization.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-79939" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Derbyshire is an honorable and highly intelligent man, but his constitutional pessimism is utter nonsense. Same for Gottfried and Buchanan. Yes, the West faces the gravest crisis since the looming but unrealized threat of Tamurlane. But we are still in control of our destinies. Our crisis, for the moment, remains internally generated.  We have lost the racial will to endure. There are many causes of this collapse (I continue to believe changed yet erroneous morality is chief among them), and the definitive book on how whites were transformed into race liberals remains to be written.</p>
<p>But not all of us are liberal, and though we do not yet constitute a sovereign majority anywhere, there are tens (maybe hundreds) of millions of racially awakened, if not yet White Nationalist, whites scattered across the world. The notion that these people are simply &#8220;doomed&#8221;, as Derbyshire would put it, is ludicrous in its sheer unimaginativeness, and cowardly in its acceptance.</p>
<p>What is required is the constant hard work of racial instruction and awakening of our people, as well as the forging of coherent political (and martial) entities out of those so awakened. There is a kind of pacifism in pessimism that is unbecoming in white men. I wish Derbyshire the best and thank him for is contributions, but the serious among us should deal with our dispossession, not dwell on what was lost with effete and cosseted abandon.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Not really.  We&rsquo;re just confused, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>(But first, let&rsquo;s clarify . . . Timur - Tamerlane - was actually allied with Catholics (France and Spain) against the Turks.  He never threatened Europe, as far as I know.  His main focus was the Ottoman Empire.  Good lesson to remember for whites . . . just think of Timu as the mestizos and the Ottomans and the blacks.)</p>
<p>Back to the point - have we lost the racial will?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t lost it and there are thousands just like me.  Many more around the world.</p>
<p>We succumbed to powerful propaganda in the 60 years between the 1950s and 2010s.  Our children and young adults have been taught to hate themselves and appease the foreigner and non-white.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re seeing a resurgence of white nationalism.  Whites see what it&rsquo;s like under progressives, socialists, white libs and blacks.  They see that we&rsquo;ve gone bankrupt with gibbs-me and blacks are WORSE today than 60 years ago.   They see what happened at Duke and what&rsquo;s happening now in Sanford.</p>
<p>Revolutions begin like tidal wave.  The ocean looks very still . . . but then there&rsquo;s an earthquake deep beneath and that energy carries through the mass of water and forms powerful waves.</p>
<p>Right now, we&rsquo;re just starting to experience the first tremors.  Be patient.</p>

I have forgotten who it was exactly - one of the Khans, the Golden Horde, someone in that period - who had preparations for the (further) invasion of Europe (the horde already having penetrated deep into Eastern Europe), which, however, never were launched due to internal political dissensions at the chief Mongol Court. Had the Mongols invaded then, it is likely Western Europe would have fallen, too.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I respectfully disagree.  No one pulling down a six or seven figure salary is going to willingly move to the ghetto unless he bought a city block and is gentrifying it.  So if you don&rsquo;t see conservative commentators attending MLK Elementary School&rsquo;s annual kwanzaa extravaganza, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;avoidance behavior&#8221; . . . it&rsquo;s capitalism.  Their kids are going to the best schools they can afford . . . same place the rare denizens of the ghetto who still parent would send their kids if they could.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no &#8220;despair&#8221; on the part of either conservatives or liberals.</p>
<p>Liberals believe that blacks got a raw deal and kept getting the same raw deal until they intervened in the late 1950s.  They compare 300+ years of slavery and Jim Crow to the 60 years of the Great Society and conclude that more needs to be done.  Trillions more.</p>
<p>Conservatives roll their eyes at liberal programs and believe capitalism can solve everything.  You know . . . lower capital gains, lower taxes and just watch Detroit roar back to life.</p>
<p>But conservatives are not racilaists.  Just because someone voted for McCain doesn&rsquo;t mean he believes that blacks are genetically inferior to whites and incapable of living in white society (without white handlers).</p>
<p>So why these top echelon, intellectual racialists keep trying to &#8220;reach&#8221; conservatives is beyong me.</p>
<p>We are as different from conservatives as we are from liberals. We&rsquo;re the 3rd rail and NO ONE wants to cozy up to the 3rd rail.</p>

<p>I think we need to take things in stages.  Right now, we&rsquo;re in the very early stages of awakening whites to the realities of racialism.  </p>
<p>At some point, sooner rather than later, I believe . . . will come the political struggle.  I believe that struggle will begin peacefully but then at some point Clausewitzian wisdom (&#8220;war is an extension of politics&#8221;) will prevail and the struggle will turn violent.</p>
<p> Many whites will be against us and join the non-whites.</p>
<p>We must have allies.   We should embrace the Zimmermans of the world and the Bruce Lees and mulattos and whatever half-breed is willing to live in a white racial state.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;ve won, we can give these &#8216;breeds their own political state or compensate them in other ways.  </p>
<p>Or . . . maybe we allow them to live with us and we rely on genetic science to ensure that the product of two Thais, or a Thai and a white is a full-blooded white.</p>
<p>Racial eugenics can ensure that even the mixture of the two most feral blacks in the Congo is a white man.  </p>
<p>We might even work out an accommodation and put the blacks to work at doing the only thing they seem to be good at:  reproduction.  </p>
<p>We give black couples plenty of fried chicken and fotys and they mass produce embryos which white scientists then turn white.  </p>
<p>Our scientists can jack up the IQ from 80 to 120 . . . dampen down the feral nature . . . eliminate the fixation on fried chicken . . . transform the physical features from simian to nordic . . . and make then human.</p>
<p>I believe that ultimately, that&rsquo;s what this racial struggle is all about:  The political power to allow racial eugenics to make the world human (i.e., white).</p>

<p>You cannot have White Europeans without a White Aesthetic. European genes are far too recessive, especially against Mongoloids and Negroids. By mixing with later groups, you will only be able to create further non-whites, never whites.</p>
<p>Take a look at the situation in Latin America with the mestizos (the product of large scale European-Mongoloid mixing). How many mestizos are offended by anti-white rhetoric? Ask Lula da Silva. Next to Zero. So, how would you expect further non-white looking mongoloid hybrids to be beneficial to protecting white interests?</p>
<p>You can befriend a Chinese, just as you can befriend an Arab, an Indian or a Jew, however promoting intermixing with a Mongoloid or a Negroid is very much dangerous and even lethal to the preservation of the White Phenotype (and by extension the White race; again take a look at the mestizos in Latin America for further proof of this necessity).</p>

Take a look at the pictures of her out there. It is harder to tell as Mongoloid genes are dominant over European genes, but it is likely that she and her family are about 20-25% White by the way of the Spaniard colonists (maybe even a greater percentage, like I said it is difficult to tell as Mongoloid genes are dominant).</p>
<p>So, Enrique would technically be 5/8ths Euro, 3/8ths Asian, similar to Brandon Lee. That is not a proper half and half comparison and even then Enrique&rsquo;s siblings look very Filipino. So, the fact that Mongoloid phenotypes remain dominant at even the 5/8ths-3/4ths levels shows just how strong they are. You&rsquo;ll see the same thing with Quadroons. Sure, some may pass for white, but the majority will not.</p>
<p>Hence why the majority of Castizos/Quadroons/ 3/4ths Eurasians still do not look white. So, overall, overwhelmingly and ultimately the advantage goes to the Mongoloids/Negroids. This is incredibly detrimental and toxic to Europeans.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Americans are raised with the quaint idea that gov&rsquo;t should represent them, not oppress them.  That gov&rsquo;t should have to explain itself, and answer to the people, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>These are the seeds of a peaceful revolution, and I don&rsquo;t see how the regime can stand in the way of change forever.</p>
<p>Eventually, Americans will cotton on to the idea that no, there aren&rsquo;t any legitimate justifications for the current abrogations of their Right to Freedom of Association.  And if the regime resists the appropriate changes, it will be replaced.  The current regime cannot survive a collapse of its legitimacy in the eyes of White Americans.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-332077" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>LOL. Here are some ways:</p>
<p>Ignore the masses. Don&rsquo;t even count their vote. They may not already.</p>
<p>Feed them endless race-egalitarian propaganda, and flood the television with it. Ridicule all radical thought and eradicate any claims which legitimize resistance to the federal leviathan or promote group solidarity.</p>
<p>Terrorize the people and watch them at all times, so all resistance can immediately be neutralized by lawful or unlawful means. The people in this country are terrified to speak their minds, given the political and social climate, and political correctness, which is an intentional offshoot of the largest terrorist network in the world, the American imperial power apparatus, and are utterly and hopeless subjugated. Just look around. People have no idea where to turn, but no something is terribly amiss.</p>
<p>Establish total military supremacy and its concomitant relative power, over everyone and anything. </p>
<p>Banish anyone from the public spotlight who tells Americans the truth.</p>
<p>Condition everyone to accept the banishment of such types and to marginalize them themselves.</p>
<p>Ignore the people entirely and let the corporations write the laws.</p>
<p>I could go on, but no need.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already staving off armed revolution with all their might and by all means necessary, including complete disregard for the constitution. Their legitimacy wanes in the eyes of the citizenry day by day. Their whole paradigm is one of avoiding much needed correction. Everything from the surveillance state to the corporate media is designed to oppress you and most of all, to delude you my friend. But there will be an armed revolution, because the idiots in charge will create a crisis, and one of epic proportions I&rsquo;d bet. I don&rsquo;t know if it will be of the type described on here, but eventually, definitely.</p>

This is pretty much what happens to anyone (of any race) who&rsquo;s bold enough to be brutally honest: you&rsquo;re strung up and publicly hanged to server as a warning to anyone who so much as thinks about violating certain orthodoxies. Bill Cosby and the late Sam Francis come to mind as two well-regarded men who, quoting Shakespeare&rsquo;s &#8220;Macbeth&#8221;, &#8220;&hellip;suffered the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune&#8221;, via the lost of status in both community and profession. <br/>
(Well, actually, Bill Cosby, while branded by most blacks I imagine as an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; for shinning a light on black America&rsquo;s &#8220;dirty laundry&#8221;, still holds a position in mainstream circles. Mr. Francis, on the other hand, lost his position as a Washington Post writer for daring to speak about race from a politically incorrect standpoint. While differing in level and degree due to the racial status quo in this country, both gentlemen spoke the real truth and were admonished for doing so by our elite.)As for John Derbyshire, I&rsquo;m going to assume that a smart man like him must have seen this coming; so it should not be so much of shock to him. Even though I&rsquo;m an American of African descent, I must say that reading some of Mr. Derbyshire&rsquo;s articles on race for while now has left me with something to think about in regards to my people. Mr. Debbyshire, if you&rsquo;re reading this, know that I am black; and while I may not necessarily agree with point of view about my people, I&rsquo;ll be among those who&rsquo;ll defend to the death your Constitutional right to write what you want.</p>

It seems one Raymond Aubrac has gone to his reward. Aubrac,born Ray Samuel,was a French Jew active in the Resistance. After being caught and,they say,tortured by Klaus Barbie,the so-called Butcher of Lyon,he was set free in a dramatic escape,and smuggled to London to work for DeGaulle. The escape plan had been relayed to him by his wife,who,after telling the Germans she wanted to marry her &#8220;fiance&#8221;,was allowed to see him. After the war he was put in charge of Marseille,but he had a bad habit of brutally sadistically torturing  Nazi collaborators. He was also accused of being a Nazi collaborator himself. (No doubt to make a tidy profit in some scheme,to the detriment of French catholics.)He later distiguished himself as a confidante of&hellip;Ho Chi Mihn. He was a Jew, and like the scorpion,he had to be what he was. A sadistic monster,a lying corrupt filthy cheat,and a friend to dictators. What a guy. </p>

Our race submits to an extinction inflicted on itself by its own members, the most neurotic and baleful crusade in human history.  But try to imagine the facial expressions that will be seen on the faces of egalitarians when it is too late, and they at last are forced to understand what they have done to their descendants.</p>
<p>Western civilization compares to Toynbee&rsquo;s other 16 discernible civilizations in about the same way that opera compares to rap, or Dostoevsky to Norman Mailer, or Bosch and Bruegel to finger painting.<br/>
High civilizations cannot be sustained by a random sampling of the world&rsquo;s peoples, nor even by a majority of Caucasians.  Truth is, our civilization depends utterly on a critical mass of the sort of people who participate in these forums, a very tiny minority of vulnerable souls who on current evidence seem destined to be swallowed whole by the racial sewage pounding on the city walls.  </p>
<p>I think we ought to stop pretending that we are not racists.  Racism is an attitude and a philosophy that is easily to be defended, as well as having served 99% of the species over 99% of historical time. I  am no more bothered by accusations of racism than of vegetarianism, or of prefering mayonnaise to butter.  At one time homosexualism was deemed unspeakable, but now is lauded everywhere and almost required in some quarters.  Racism needs to be made respectable, too.</p>
<p>I, personally, would prefer human life to come to an end than to see it sink to the level of New York,<br/>
Mexico,  sub-Saharan Africa, or Hollywood, where current ideals are much worse than nothing at all.<br/>
In spite of everything however, I do see at least a few causes for hope, namely Alex, Richard, Derby, Jared, etc., etc. - some hundred or more bright brilliant souls.   </p>

<p>I shudder to think about the future of the White race if there is no racial awakening real soon.  You are right, words like &#8220;racist&#8221; has all but shut down the natual self preservation of the White race.  That was the goal though, wasn&rsquo;t it? </p>

That there is, perhaps, good and bad in all groups of people. That may not be a lesson taught in &#8220;Psychology 101.&#8221; But you will learn it in any &#8220;Human Decency&#8221; class.</p>
<p>You know what your problem is, Anon? You only allow yourself see the &#8220;evil&#8221; in others  while only regarding your own as &#8220;good.&#8221; That&rsquo;s a tautology that you&rsquo;ve chosen to indulge in. You&rsquo;re simply incapable of looking at things objectively, and that&rsquo;s a shame on your part.</p>

That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re attracted the simplistic religion of Islam, especially its extremist strains, and why their societies are chaotic, violent, corrupt, and stagnant. The average East Asian IQ is 105. I&rsquo;d rather have neither, but if I have to have one, I&rsquo;d rather have the latter.</p>

<p>The future isn&rsquo;t certain and not everything is getting worse.</p>
<p>Communism fell in Central and Eastern Europe. Now, most of the Whites in places like Russia are on our side. If things get really bad here, we can go there.</p>
<p>Many cities that were Black hells in the early 90s are now much better. Compare New York City now to when Dinkins was mayor.</p>
<p>The MSM has lost most of its credibility and no loner has a monopoly on the dissemination of news and culture.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s the Networks could make everyone watch Roots. No longer the case.</p>
<p>Look at that anti White propaganda film about the Black Air Pilots that supposedly won World War II against the evil RACIST Nazis - it lost $60 million, nobody watched it, few cared.</p>
<p>ZOG/BRA anti - White power in this country is like the Wizard&rsquo;s in the Wizard of OZ - mostly smoke and mirrors.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-81255" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Islam is simplistic because, as C. S. Lewis has pointed out, it is almost exactly the type of religion one would make up if given a clean sheet of paper. Nothing surprising, no depth.</p>
<p>In doctrines such as the Trinity, Christianity has the gritty, non-obvious feel of complex reality, much as physics does with light being both a particle and a wave, or quantum mechanics. Things that are hard to understand and perhaps beyond our capacity to grasp.</p>
<p>East Asian IQs are high not because they have pictographic systems. They can still stagger forward into modernity with the burden of (incredibly inefficient) pictographic systems because they have high IQs, which came from intense selection from cold winters.</p>
<p>The Singaporean Indian community is unlikely to be a demographic cross section of India as a whole. In the US South Asian Indians do very well, but we are skimming the cream of the subcontinent, for now.</p>
<p>Read &#8220;Understanding Human History&#8221; by Michael Hart to get a better picture of the history and heritage of various peoples in Eurasia, and why the Arabs are utterly hopeless.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-81533" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Islam as a religion is ultimately based upon both Christianity and Judaism. The Arabs saw the added corruption of  European paganistic elements within Christianity (such as the trinity, man-god worship, etc) and created a religion fundamentally designed to reconcile Christianity with Judaism in a complete and standardized comprehensive canon within the original semitic context (hence the commonalties between Islam and Judaism).</p>
<p>Islam is the result of taking the semitic logic of Judaism to the extreme with the addition of a few arab paganistic elements.</p>
<p>The reason why Christianity as you define it is &#8220;so hard to grasp&#8221;, is simply because it is logically inconsistent. It does not have any rational answers, hence why you see cafeteria christians making their religion up as they go along; priests/ministers cannot comment on these heretics as they themselves cannot answer the most fundamental of questions regarding their own religion. This is why you have seen Christian churches empty out across the West and left and right. It claims to be a monotheistic religion and oppose idolatry, yet it then places a man-god at its deity, and manufactures figures of its purported savior (catholics expand on this even more with saints). You do not see this same phenomenon among Muslims as their canon was designed to be complete from the beginning, whereas with Christianity it was a multigenerational effort with hundreds of different versions of the bible, canonical acts, heretical acts, etc.</p>
<p>When the enlightenment scholars of the 18th century attempted to reconcile Christianity with modernity by conducting a historical analysis on the religion, they discovered that the entire Christian canon itself was too corrupt to even be reformed. They ridiculed the religion from an academic perspective and from that point on secularism was formally embraced by the west with very few complaints.</p>
<p>Going by your logic of &#8220;Cold&#8221; environments producing high-iqs shouldn&rsquo;t siberians and eskimos have the highest of all iqs? They are very closely related to East Asians, after all. Of course, we do not see that.</p>
<p>What you are doing is looking at the modern context of the world and trying to extrapolate that to the historical perspective. That does not work, as 50-100 years ago, China was under the control of a totally corrupt government that placed China in an even worse shape than that of India and the Middle East. The GDP per capita of China was much lower, as was nearly every other Human Development statistic.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Communist revolution, the situation would likely have remained the same. If within 50 years, India and the Middle East experience similar levels of economic growth, would they also be considered &#8220;honorary whites&#8221; (irrespective of the fact that they are more closely related to Europeans to begin with)?</p>
<p>The East Asians have only decided to keep their pictographic writing systems as a result of cultural considerations. Prior to the arrival of the French, the Vietnamese also utilized a pictographic writing system based on Chinese characters.</p>
<p>The Indians in Singapore are a mix of both higher-class professionals and lower-class laborers. They were originally brought over by the British (as were the Chinese with a similar socio-economic mix).</p>
<p>Hart is a promoter of the Judeo-Christian line, along with other semi-neoconservative jews such as Lawrence Auster and Michael Savage. Each of these characters will claim to identify with white interests and will often discuss the most arcane of subjects censored by the MSM, but ultimately any practical prescriptions to the problems that are faced today are rejected by these very same characters. Given their sympathies to Israel and their idea of the zionist regime as being a bulwark of Judeo-Christian civilization, it&rsquo;s clear that they have issues with all those hostile to the interests of Israel including Arabs and Iranians. So, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily call him the most reliable of sources.</p>
