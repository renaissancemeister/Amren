<h1 class="title">Why Derbyshire Had to Go</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, April 7, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
There is nothing hypocrites hate more than men who live by their convictions.</div> 
</div> 


<p>John Derbyshire has now joined the roster of brilliant journalists who have been fired by publications that call themselves &ldquo;conservative.&rdquo; Mr. Derbyshire&rsquo;s April 5 <a href="http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/print#axzz1rJFc7Sbq">column</a> for Takimag.com committed the usual crime of pointing out something that is not only true but that everyone knows to be true. He noted that blacks are on average less intelligent than whites, that many of them hate whites, and that when they gather in large numbers they can be dangerous. Mr. Derbyshire&rsquo;s column was framed as a white parent&rsquo;s &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to his children about the facts of race.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone not a tourist from Iceland learns by about age 10 to avoid crowds of blacks, but it is considered &ldquo;racist&rdquo; actually to say so. It took <em>National Review</em> two days to fire Mr. Derbyshire &mdash; an eternity in the age of the Internet, even if it was Easter weekend &mdash; and lefty publications like Atlantic Wire and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/national-review-writer-race_n_1409413.html">Huffington Post</a> were yelling for blood long before the ax fell.</p>
<p><em>National Review</em>&rsquo;s editor Rich Lowry&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295514/parting-ways-rich-lowry#close">public notice</a> of dismissal started with fluff about Mr. Derbyshire&rsquo;s &ldquo;delightful first novel,&rdquo; but called his Takimag piece &ldquo;nasty and indefensible.&rdquo; This is another way of saying Mr. Derbyshire was writing honestly about race, and <em>National Review</em> has a history of firing people who write honestly.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the magazine was saying sensible things about immigration, multiculturalism, and even race and IQ. It defended <em>The Bell Curve</em>, called for serious immigration reform and published Philippe Rushton. This was too much for the NR&rsquo;s founder, William Buckley, who removed the two men most responsible for honesty. He forced out Editor John O&rsquo;Sullivan in December 1997, and in February 1998 exiled Senior Editor <a href="http://vdare.com/">Peter Brimelow</a> to the powerless position of Contributing Editor. Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s replacement was none other than the Mr. Lowry who now finds Mr. Derbyshire&rsquo;s work &ldquo;nasty and indefensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buckley was jumpy about anyone who got frisky. In 1993 he had already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Sobran">fired</a> Joe Sobran for writing columns Buckley called &ldquo;contextually anti-Semitic.&rdquo; Anyone who violated what Buckley liked to call &ldquo;the prevailing structure of taboos&rdquo; was out the door.</p>
<p>Just two years later, another &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; publication, the <em>Washington Times</em>, <a href="/ar/2005/04/index.html#article2">fired</a> Sam Francis for remarks he made at an American Renaissance <a href="../../../archives/conferences/ar1994.html">conference</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was the usual sin: writing something obviously true.</p>
<p>In 1997, it was <a href="/ar/1998/03/index.html#article1">Scott McConnell</a>&rsquo;s turn to be bounced from a &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; paper, this time, the <em>New York Post</em>. In a July 14 column he pointed out that Puerto Ricans are poor, live on food stamps, are often hostile to English, and that it was therefore a bad idea to make Puerto Rico the 51st state. He suggested that instead of going on about how wonderful statehood would be for Puerto Ricans we should actually talk about whether it would be good for <em>us</em>. Thirty Puerto Rican &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; had a meeting with <em>Post</em> publisher Martin Singerman, and Mr. McConnell was gone.</p>
<p>A more recent example of &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; turning on their own was <em>Human Events</em>&rsquo; 2005 firing of Kevin Lamb for editing a magazine the Southern Poverty Law Center called &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; All it took was one phone call from the SPLC and in just a few hours Mr. Lamb was out of a job.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the Maine Heritage Policy Center, which bills itself as a &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; advocacy group, fired political reporter Leif Parsell after it discovered that he had written that &ldquo;cultural diversity combines with our increasing racial and ethnic diversity to degrade our society&rdquo; and had recommended a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSF5zoTFVSc">video</a> by me in which I point out that diversity is not a strength.</p>
<p>And, of course, in February, Patrick Buchanan was <a href="http://buchanan.org/blog/the-new-blacklist-5007">fired</a> from MSNBC for his book <em>Suicide of a Superpower</em>, in which he made such common-sense observations as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mexico is moving north. Ethnically, linguistically, and culturally, the verdict of 1848 is being overturned. Will this Mexican nation within a nation advance the goals of the Constitution &mdash; to &lsquo;insure domestic tranquility&rsquo; and &lsquo;make us a more perfect union&rsquo;? Or has our passivity in the face of this invasion imperiled our union?</p></blockquote>
<p>MSNBC&rsquo;s president explained that such ideas were not &ldquo;appropriate for the national dialogue.&rdquo; Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s case is slightly different, since he was fired from a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; network, but where is the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; network that is rushing to take him on?</p>
<p>Clearly, as an ex-journalist who violated &ldquo;the prevailing structure of taboos,&rdquo; Mr. Derbyshire adds his own indisputable luster to a distinguished group. But what does it say about our country that even &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; &mdash; and only &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; &mdash; suffer from such hair-trigger nervousness about race? When was a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; ever fired for calling whites &ldquo;the cancer of the human race&rdquo; or demanding &ldquo;the abolition of the white race&rdquo;? It doesn&rsquo;t happen. There is no such thing as &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; excess. You can say the vilest things about white people and be a hero.</p>
<p>Why is this? Part of it is the vicious double standard that protects every group but whites from &ldquo;negative stereotypes,&rdquo; but it is also because no one is afraid of obvious foolishness. Even crazed, ethnomasochist whites who say hateful things about their own race clearly do not believe them. They do not repent of &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; by giving up their jobs to pet minorities. They do not &ldquo;celebrate diversity&rdquo; in their own lives.</p>
<p>What people like John Derbyshire say is different. He must be fired, silenced, and disgraced because everyone &mdash; from the mooncalves at Huffington Post to the &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; at National Review &mdash; <em>lives by the very rules Mr. Derbyshire put into print. </em>I don&rsquo;t even know Rich Lowry but I&rsquo;m sure he avoids crowds of blacks, does not live in a black neighborhood, and would never send his children to a black school. He may babble racial moonshine to his children, but the real &ldquo;talk&rdquo; he gives them is exactly the one Mr. Derbyshire wrote about. Mr. Lowry&rsquo;s real &ldquo;talk&rdquo; is <em>the way he lives his life</em>.</p>
<p>And that is why Mr. Derbyshire had to go. There is nothing cowards and hypocrites hate more than brave men who live by their convictions.</p>
<p><em><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: Mr. Derbyshire now has no job but still has a wife and two children. In the last day or so <em>a &#8220;contribute&#8221; button has appeared on </em>his personal <a href="http://johnderbyshire.com/">home page</a>. We think we know why. Please be generous.</em></em></p>

<p>&#8220;In that pool of forty million, there are nonetheless many intelligent and well-socialized blacks. (I&rsquo;ll use IWSB as an ad hoc abbreviation.) (He uses it because he doesn&rsquo;t have the stones to say &#8220;magical negro&#8221;-Ed.) You should consciously seek opportunities to make friends with IWSBs.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78354" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Derbyshire not a hypocrite?</p>
<p>Derbyshire by marrying a Chinese women and having two mixed race kids and bringing them up in the United States, has  benefitted from the same very immigration reforms in the 1960s that he now decries. </p>
<p>Derbyshire also benefits from the repealing of anti-miscegenation laws in the 1960s, and the fact that his mixed-race children can expect equal opportunites in the United States, and an atmosphere relatively free of racial harrassment, and a system to deal with harrassment when it occurs, are all thanks to the brave actions of blacks and whites who fought for civil rights (Asians were largely absent from this struggle).</p>
<p> Is Rich Lowry, the editor labelled as a hypocrite by Mr Taylor, married to a non-white spouse and have non-white kids? I don&rsquo;t think so, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Surely a true white nationalist would find Derbyshire to be a far more reprehensible piece of works than even a white liberal who has married white with white kids.</p>
<p>From a WN perspective, at least a white liberal with white kids will not contribute to the racial displacement of whites in the US. But Derbyshire, your ally, has mixed race kids,  who will contribute to white racial displacement.</p>
<p>Again the easy ride WNs give to Derbyshire shows the utter hypocrisy within your ranks. White men with Asian wome is OK, but white women married to blacks would be condemned as race traitors.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78390" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wayne.  How is it ever hypocritical to write the truth?  As far as marriage goes,  has Derbyshire ever written that it is wrong for a white man to marry a Chinese woman?  Also, when has Derbyshire ever presumed to be a &#8220;white nationalist?&#8221;  Perhaps if he&rsquo;d have married a black it would have been different, but he didn&rsquo;t, so that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>One other point: Asian women are generally adaptable, and at least the older generation have a sense of family and tradition.  They are generally not loud, obnoxious, prone to promiscuity, are gentle, and caring.  And while aesthetics are somewhat subjective, they can be quite attractive to some men.  So at least a case can be made as a personal preference.   </p>
<p>At the same time, I believe that, like the Chinese, we should honor our ancestors.  Having mixed race children is, therefore, not generally advised from a strictly racial standpoint.  But none of this argues against what Derbyshire wrote about blacks.  If anything, he was too circumspect.</p>
<p>I think you are just angry because some Chinese women prefer to marry white men.  It is understandable from your perspective, but, again, that does not affect whatever Derbyshire said about blacks.</p>

<p>Giving Money To John Derbyshire, And Why<br/>
By Peter Brimelow on April 8, 2012 at 12:22pm John Derbyshire, latest victim of what is obviously a co-ordinated drive to purge the MSM, has just added a donate link to his website. I urge readers to help him.Derbyshire writes on his site:&#8221;I live entirely, and somewhat precariously, by the pen&#8221;. He does not add that his chemotherapy now makes him too sick to work for about two weeks each month.I have long viewed the pygmies at National Review with such contempt that it rarely occurs to me to expect anything of them &mdash; but, really, how hard would it have been for Rich Lowry to say that, although he disapproved of this one column (grovel, grovel) which of course did not actually appear on NR (more grovels), he could not fire a sick man, with a family to support, who had given such loyal service for 15 years?</p>

<p>There is no way Derbyshire published these absolute but forbidden truths about black crime rates and the mandate for whites to take precautions without knowing what the repercussion would be. </p>
<p>I would like Mr. Lowry to point out exactly what Mr. Derbyshire wrote that was false or not excellent advice to give to one&rsquo;s children in light of black crime rates.  There is nothing in the article that can&rsquo;t be backed up by hard proof and decades of solid evidence.</p>
<p>Now that he&rsquo;s dispatched &ldquo;the evil racist&rdquo; and toed the Manhattan PC line,  the metrosexual Lowry can safely go back to his A-list brie parties in 95% White, gated and secured communities and know all is well.</p>

<p>Truth had nothing to do with the decision to fire Derbyshire.  Mainstream conservatism has been devoid of truth for so long, that I half suspect that they actually believe their liberal ideology.  On the other hand, they are more likely just cowards who want to appear civil.  Remember this when you go to vote for Romney, their candidate, this November.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a terrible fact of life that mainstream journalism, from Left to Right is now PC - and racially conscious Whites are persecuted, purged in similar ways to how homosexuals were once treated. That&rsquo;s life.</p>

Not just non-whites either. It&rsquo;s not race realism, it&rsquo;s just realism. realism about your own kind and realism about those who are different.</p>
<p>I leave myself sometimes when I see potentially volatile people of my own color. You have to have good judgement and keep your antenna up at all times. It&rsquo;s a matter of life and death. Not a joke. Anyone who is incognizant of the potential dangers around them is a fool. There are rational protocols for dealing with the dangerous situations you may encounter on the American street, or for avoiding them in the first place. People should learn them and children should be taught.</p>

<p>Marginalized people and groups everywhere in the world, regardless of race, generally have higher crime rates and lower IQs.</p>
<p>Derbyshire of course simply correlates crime with poverty, and then poverty with race. And then says race causes crime. </p>
<p>He is the ultimate hypocrite, benefitting off non-racist immigration criteria, the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws that many here would like to re-introduce, a cultural environment which scorns racism, thereby allowing his two non-white children to be able to enjoy life in America without overt discrimination, and all these good things were fought for at great effort and sacrifice by black people and leftish whites.</p>
<p>Yet he goes and attacks and villifies those on the left without whom he would never have been able to bring his family over here and start a normal family.</p>
<p>Derbyshire is a coward and hypocrite.</p>

                     I have read many stories about blacks murdering Chinese food delivery men - apparently because they&rsquo;d much rather take a Chinese life than pay the few dollars needed to settle the bill.Think about that one - they put the value of a Chinese life lower than the price of a take out chicken chow mein plus side orders.<br/>
 One particular case I remember reading about concerned an order taken to a stinking hovel in some housing project. The food delivery man arrived, the food handed over, and in return a high caliber magnum bullet was promptly emptied into the large skull of the food delivery man. His body fell to the floor twitching and bleeding profusely in its death throes. Meanwhile the pack of balck murderes tucked greedily into their take order whilst the twitching, bleeding body cooled down in the stinking room.<br/>
  True story.</p>

I think we face a much more serious problem in blacks and mexicans than Orientals because they have no interest on preying on Whites, they never act violent or do the things blacks do to Whites.  They do prey on other Orientals.  I don&rsquo;t really care one way or another - but they are not threatening and seem pretty harmless - they don&rsquo;t seem pugnacious like the others.  We have a much bigger problem:  feral savage negroes with a vicious hate of Whites and fecund mexicans who want to degrade White areas, and the blacks want more than just that: they want to stick a screwdriver in your eyes after raping you.  No, before raping you so you can enjoy some eye pain as well as a sore ass.  The only threat posed by Orientals is when they become numerous enough to push you out of your old neighborhood, their new one.  Other than that they&rsquo;re fine. For now anyway.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78363" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>John Derbyshire&rsquo;s article in Takimag.com contained several facts about the IQ and character of Blacks, including some common sense in dealing with them (although the part about befriending the good or more civilized ones so as to demonstrate that one is not a racist or something to that effect was just plain weird). Similar, however, to MSNBC&rsquo;s president who had Pat Buchanan fired, Rich Lowry of National Review appears to also think that any open discussion on the intelligence of Blacks and how they conduct themselves when in large numbers is not &#8220;appropriate for the national dialogue.&#8221; Why not though? It&rsquo;s not as if what Derbyshire said in his article was from somewhere off in left field or unproven by science. Even the history and experience of Whites who have dealt with Blacks demonstrates that they are, in many respects, a dangerous race. Thus, the kind of advice Derbyshire gives to his children is one that all Whites should give to their children because  it is true and rooted in human experience. </p>
<p>Instead of firing John Derbyshire, why couldn&rsquo;t have others from National Review simply published rebuttals to his article? What would have been so wrong to have an open debate or discussion on such matters? National Review, after all, could have still maintained its opposition to Derbyshire&rsquo;s views without having to fire a journalist who had obviously contributed so much that was insightful over the years. I thought (perhaps naively) Conservatives were supposed to be the ones more interested in truth, &#8216;liberal&rsquo; in the classical sense and open-minded? What a disgrace! </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78377" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Of course, it is very easy for the self-styled &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; to make a big show of proving their credentials - long windy denunciations, a self-flagellating orgy of breast-beating, wailing and gnashing of teeth, tearful speeches, public foot-washings etc, you get the picture (reminds me of shia muslims publicly commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein).<br/>
 It&rsquo;s the pack mentality, basic reptilian-brain animal instinct and dominance displays.In their ectasy of disavowal the self-styled &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; display their pack hierarchy and loyalty to their alpha or &#8216;god&rsquo;. The one who can do outdo the others in ritual acts of breast-beating and denunciation is the most worthy.<br/>
 However, despite the breast-beatting and clothes-rending, utter, utter savagery and mercilessness is shown to however is deemed the &#8216;enemy&rsquo;. No cruelty or indignation is too heavy to be inflicted on the transgressor, here too the self-styled &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; display their ardor in a competition to show who is the cruellest and most ruthless. Woe betide the sacrificial victim. It&rsquo;s rather ironic that this is all happening on Easter Sunday.</p>

White people, on this Easter Sunday, we need a &#8220;resurrection&#8221; of our own.  We need to &#8220;go Galt&#8221; regarding other races and strive to make improvements that benefit us personally WITHOUT regard for those other races.<br/>

A &#8220;virtual country&#8221; is now possible utilizing the internet.  It is time to &#8220;work outside the system&#8221;.   Of course, there are those who will (attempt to) put &#8220;roadblocks&#8221; up to deter our successes.  Sadly, many of those who oppose us will be of our own race.  We must do things &#8220;by any means necessary&#8221; to insure our survival as a race . . .<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78461" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Conservatives and the Liberals are two sides of the same coin, namely the Establishment. Notice how they work together when a real threat is mounted against the establishment such as when David Duke ran for public office in Louisiana years ago. The republicrats rose as one voice to denounce him. They did the same thing to George Wallace. And we all know what happened to Hughy Long of Louisiana, a very popular populist.</p>
<p>This is how they operate. They pretend to be in opposition; actually they are with carefully selected wedge issues. These wedge issues have little effect on their main goals so the republicrats can fight all they want to over these &#8220;crumbs&#8221;. This gives the lumpenproletariat the illusion that the puppet show is real. Then the &#8220;true believers&#8221; can go to the conventions and cheer &#8220;ra ra ree, kick &#8216;em in the knee, ra ra ras, kick &#8216;em in the other knee&#8221;, and feel like they are really a part of the process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the borders stay open, the africans keep pouring in, and the dollar keeps getting weaker and weaker as the Fed keeps printing fake money. </p>

<p>Derbyshire is an old school English gentleman, caustic and acerbic.  He has made many, many remarks over the years that could be considered politically incorrect.  This column was especially egregious.  I concede that everything he says are thoughts any sensible white person would have based on practical experience.  My father and my son were both mugged by blacks, my son at gunpoint.  I was assaulted twice.  You don&rsquo;t need to be a Klan-hooded racist to notice a pattern.  I&rsquo;ve never been assaulted by a member of any other race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>But as far as NR&rsquo;s decision to fire him, you have to be sympathetic.  A magazine is a going concern and it cannot afford to let itself become the target of expensive, no-win, bad-publicity  litigation.  Litigation nearly sank The American Spectator in the Clinton years.  Lowry&rsquo;s decision, however regrettable, was the only choice he could have made.  The alternative was to defend a columnist whose statements could not have been publicly defended.  Just imagine a militant black asking Lowry, point-blank, on television, why he hadn&rsquo;t fired Derbyshire and you see the problem.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78459" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I saw this coming long ago. The West is now groaning under a soft-totalitarianism at least as vicious as the hard Soviet variety.Everything goes back to the cardinal error of refusing to fight for the MORAL basis of the Racial Principle. There is an inner logic to human ideas- if the premise gains acceptance, it will expand (see &#8220;liberal egalitarianism applied to&#8221;, first Jews, then blacks, then women, then immigrants, now homosexuals, next pedophiles &hellip;). Ideas work themselves out &lsquo;logically&rsquo; unless they are vigorously opposed. I saw this wrt anti-racism. Conservatives just folded without a fight. The end result will be not only this ever-intensifying totalitarian persecution of patriotic whites, but the extinction of the white race.A species either fights or dies.(AR&rsquo;s race-realism, however morally unexceptionable, is probably inadequate to the task of saving the white race from extinction. What is needed is White Nationalism, but a WN that finds its justification within, and not in being opposed to, Christianity.) </p>

<p>Rob &mdash; which was previously known as ¡Rob! but, for reasons known only to CBS upper management, the network dropped the upside-down exclamation point, making copy editors everywhere sigh with relief &mdash; stars Rob Schneider as Rob, a sad sack and OCD-prone gringo who marries Maggie, a drop-dead-gorgeous Mexican-American woman (Claudia Bassols), after dating her for only six weeks. Their wedding &mdash; which, naturally, takes place on the spur of the moment at a Las Vegas chapel &mdash; comes as a terrible surprise to Maggie&rsquo;s sprawling family, who never envisioned her with a short, white husband.

<p><b>How to succeed in racism without really trying: John Derbyshire tells his children to stay away from black people</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/pageviews/2012/04/how-to-succeed-in-racism-without-really-trying-john-derbyshire-tells-his-children-" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/pageviews/2012/04/how-to-succeed-in-racism-without-really-trying-john-derbyshire-tells-his-children-</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd that blacks can rant about how evil and dangerous white people are (while demanding to live and work among whites) yet we can&rsquo;t even cites facts on black violence.</p>
<p>CNN did a group discussion yesterday. The subject concerned whites using facts and figures to call attention to the fact that black on black crime is rarely reported while blacks are using a single incident of white on black crime to tar whites as &#8216;racists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The consensus was that whites are doing so because they don&rsquo;t want to face up to their own racism and whites just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>The panel included two comedians. Yes, comedians.</p>
<p>They defended people like Bill Maher for his comments about Zimmerman because Maher is a comedian. Apparently there&rsquo;s an attack on comedians for speaking their minds. Apparently, comedians enjoy a special right of free speech that others do not. Apparently if you&rsquo;re a registered comedian like Maher or Lenny Bruce you can engage in honest and insightful social commentary while remainng  immune to criticism.</p>
<p>Maybe Mr. Derbyshire can take up a new career in stand-up.  Then he will be free to say anything he wants.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78512" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Besides sounding off here (and on TakiMag and everywhere else where it&rsquo;s brought up on the Net), one thing you (anybody) can do, is send John&rsquo;s article (and Jared&rsquo;s and anyone else who tells the truth) to <b>every single person</b> you know. Maybe they&rsquo;ll read it and maybe they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Remember the AmRen poster who used to say (and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing, b/c I have a mental block on his exact quote) something like, &#8216;More is better&rsquo;? He wanted The Messiah to be elected with the hopes that it would FINALLY wake up some people who didn&rsquo;t want to see Africa in action here in America. (Same principle as <i>some</i> liberals won&rsquo;t wake up until they&rsquo;ve been PERSONALLY mugged.)</p>
<p>Well, we got our half black dictator and you see the results. You think this is bad? Just wait if this black muslim marxist is reelected. There won&rsquo;t be ANY constraints on him. (And that goes for every one of his leftist causes, not just racial ones, although they will be high on the list.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another (tiny) thing you can do - no matter who the Republican nominee is, vote for him even if you&rsquo;re choking on your own vomit (which I will). Last time we had McCain and the rap against him is he&rsquo;d institute the same causes as NoBama, but more slowly. Maybe so, but if someone gave you the chance to drown in one hour or one year, which choice would you take?</p>
<p>You can either fight for that one year and do everything in your own respective powers to do SOMETHING or choose the one hour and fight for NOTHING.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a prominent &#8216;conservative&rsquo; radio talk show host who said he&rsquo;d vote for a can of orange juice over Dear Leader. I met him once and joked that that was a perfectly good waste of orange juice. I said I&rsquo;d empty the can, drink the juice and THEN vote for the empty can. He got a laugh out that.</p>
<p>Vote for that can - empty or full&hellip;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78518" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The fate of John Derbyshire should be a cautionary tale for those of us who are in some way connected to American Renaissance. For giving common sense advice on how to avoid becoming a crime victim he was fired by the leading conservative magazine in the United States. Beyond this website, and perhaps a few others there has not been a collective outcry of anger. No other conservative publication has given him a position. FOX News has not stepped forward with an employment offer.<br/>
 <br/>
This tells me that in the United States there is little future for a political movement that is seen as overtly anti black. I can think of two reasons for this. First, since 1992 there has been a steady decline in the rate of violent crime.<br/>
 <br/>
http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm <br/>
 <br/>
Second, the persistence of de facto segregation means that most whites come into contact with few blacks. Most of these do not seem to want to be told bad things about blacks, even when they know they are true. <br/>
 <br/>
Most liberals hate Rush Limbaugh and Charles Murray. Nevertheless, they they have not been able to take Rush Limbaugh off the air. They have not been able to prevent Charles Murray from publishing.  Charles Murray gets articles published in prestigious journals, including liberal ones like The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The New Republic. <br/>
 <br/>
In addition, Thomas Edsall, whom I consider to be a moderately liberal Democrat, has made a career explaining the Republican domination of the United States. His argument is that during the 1960s the Democrat Party became identified with the defense of black interests, and blacks remain identified with social pathology. <br/>
 <br/>
In the twenty-first century Rush Limbaugh, Charles Murray, and Thomas Edsall seem to illustrate acceptable limits on criticizing blacks in the United States. <br/>
 <br/>
One does not get places in politics by changing person&rsquo;s minds. One gets places by articulating and channeling sentiments that already exist. If one feels something strongly it is easy to overestimate the number of people who feel the same way; it is easy to underestimate the difficulty of converting others to one&rsquo;s persuasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone must have yanked the purse strings. The reality is that most of these people send their kids to private school and roll down [up?] the windows in black neighborhoods, and they will tell you so over drinks. You don&rsquo;t have to think you are superior to everyone of another race to speak honestly about race in America. You just have to have an honest bone left in your body. These &#8216;respectable publications&rsquo; will fail within a generation, because they don&rsquo;t have anything to offer but a handful of talking points and sanctioned opinions. I hope the editors die in state funded nursing homes run by brown people who hate them and spit in their food. But they probably won&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re privileged and will be able to afford the finest care. The rest of us will be treated to the results of their cowardice, lies, and hypocrisy.&#8221;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78565" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have read Derbyshire&rsquo;s stuff over the years, some of it is entertaining and good value - particularly has math and science writing, but he gives the impression of not being a <i>real</i> dissident. He is in a sense an <i>approval seeking</i> dissident; in his interviews he frequently contrives the image of the curmudgeonly english eccentric, but his attempts at humour often fall flat, eliciting only sporadic and forced laughter from his audience. His reaction to the audience non-reaction to his feeble attempts at humour are a sort of half-grimace   &mdash;  it is really noticeable.</p>
<p>As an aside he also has this tendency to tell porkies to support his arguments   &mdash;  among these his claim that rafts of corpses of those killed violently use to float down into Hong Kong from mainland China during the Cultural Revolution, and that Chinese border guards would machine gun mainland escapees to Hong Kong   &mdash;  -all of which is complete unadulterated rubbish (it is common knowledge that many &#8216;refugees&rsquo; would try swimming to HK, be rounded up, sent back, and re-attempt coming back in many times).</p>
<p>Derbyshire understands he has a real cohort of support among white supremacists and white &#8216;nationalists&rsquo;, but even more so he understands he has the silent assent of a large part of the white population - which is sad. Even Lowry&rsquo;s dismissal note was only half-condemnatory, in fact it was almost flattering in nature, and really, Derbyshire will be fine. He is well past retirement age, has cancer, and really not much to lose anyway.</p>
<p>The people who are the really brave ones are those who do not have the assent of the &#8216;silent majority&rsquo;   &mdash;  the likes of Tim Wise, who says things to white people which really does enrage white people inside.</p>
<p>What Derbyshire has said will not induce <i>real</i> rage and antipathy -even among many so called liberal whites, and particularly not among conservatives. There will only be feigned disapproval, not visceral disapproval. So Derbyshire is actually safe, and he knows it.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr Taylor who is a real dissident, Derbyshire is a bit of a bandwagon jumper.</p>

Sometimes people have to stay away from certain people of their own color and descent. All of us, realistically, are most likely to be assaulted or killed by someone of our own kind. Nevertheless, the reason why there is not more interracial violent crime than already occurs is because people do learn to watch themselves.

<p>Who cares what happened in Alabama in 1930?  What does that have to do with any pro-White issue?</p>
<p>You being racially Chinese, how would you like it if your homeland were being inundated with millions of non-Chinese who were putting an end to your historic culture and your way of life? What if you woke up one morning and saw that the president of China was ethnically Pakistani? What if you suddenly found that the Chinese people are literally threatened with extinction through genetic annihilation? Can you even imagine that? That&rsquo;s what we Whites face.<br/>
But you can&rsquo;t sympathize, because this is not happening to you. Your race and your culture are secure. Ours is not. We Whites are literally losing our nations and our identities, and people are actually cheering it on.</p>
<p> Our issue isn&rsquo;t what happened to blacks in 1930, our issue is White Survival.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78583" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>No. Youre response is pathetic.</p>
<p>Firstly you bring up the laughably absurd trope about whites facing &#8216;extinction through genetic annihilation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are 1.2 billion whites in the world, and about 1.4 billion East Asians. Whites have always held their own in terms of numbers against East Asians, and as recently as the 1950s slightly outnumbered them.</p>
<p>Whites are the second most numerous race in the world - there are about 300 million more whites in the world than there are sub-Saharan African descended people.</p>
<p>Whites control vast swathes of the world&rsquo;s territory out of all proportion to their actual numbers. Much of this territory, in fact most of this territory, was until very recent history non-white.</p>
<p>Whites are the ones who forcibly globalised the rest of the world, using the human and non-human resources of the non-white world, and built up their societies atop the blood and treasure of non-whites.</p>
<p>India itself was wealthier than Europe and the US combined in the early 19th century. As was China, which was the wealthiest place in the world.</p>
<p>China is barely the size of the US I think, and smaller than Canada. Yet it is <i>whites</i> who work actively to remove Tibet from China, Xinjiang from China, Inner Mongolia from China, reducing China to what would be about 1/3rd of her total land mass now. This is in spite of the fact that Chinese have been in these lands, and have sovereign claim to these lands than whites have been in North America!</p>
<p>So tell me. Why do whites always go round the world, lecturing to others on how to conduct their own internal affairs? Invading other countries? And trying to wreck other countries? In fact if you had not wrecked half a dozen countries in the Middle East, there is a good chance that your muslim immigration &#8216;issues&rsquo; would not nearly be as serious as you now consider them to be.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;What if you woke up one morning and saw that the president of China was ethnically Pakistani?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well basically almost the entire non-white world was controlled by whites up until only four or five decades ago. China was effectively ruled by whites for a full century, and whites even forcibly made the Chinese legalise narcotics (opium), resulting in a drug addicted population of hundreds of millions   &mdash;  all to enrich white nations.</p>
<p>If whites want not to be around non-whites, perhaps they should have thought of this before foisting themselves on the rest of the world these past few centuries. If those whites who want an all white enclaves now, just tell everyone else how much of North America you want, and I am sure non-whites and non-racist whites will be happy to grant you a state or two.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you can all pack up and return to Europe.</p>
<p>Another thing&hellip;.Mr Obama is descended from white Americans on his mother&rsquo;s side. He probably has deeper roots in North America, than many whites whose ancestors only came out 80 to 100 years ago, or even less. Certainly his wife has. So he is neither a racial or ethnic alien. He is as American as apple pie -like it or not.</p>
<p>Now you fellows are always trumpet the fact that you base your arguments on empirical evidence and take a facts based approach. Tell me now. Do you disagree that there are about 1.2 billion whites in the world, and that whites are the world&rsquo;s second most numerous race?</p>

<p>  Japan is RICH and has a horrendous colonial history, especially against the Chinese. Do you know about The Rape of Nanking, John? </p>
<p><i>In December of 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army marched into China&rsquo;s capital city of Nanking and proceeded to murder 300,000 out of 600,000 civilians and soldiers in the city.

non-Whites?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Anyone with even a superficial knowledge of China would know that that Japan  is routinely villified and attacked in the media, in popular culture   &mdash;  the government actually has to put a lid on anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
<p>Now you ask, why am I not demanding that Japan be flooded with foreigners? Well because Japan&rsquo;s immigration policy is for the Japanese people to decide on. Not me. Nor do I make demands in respect of the immigration policies of &#8216;white&rsquo; countries. </p>
<p>You see, if a white country had a zero immigration policy, they would not be attacked for racism. That would be perfectly acceptable. Same with Japan. Japan has a zero immigration policy, but Japan does not say, they will accept yellows, but not whites, nor browns - -which would definitely be racist. Japan simply says they are too crowded and do not need people at all. That is perfectly OK and <i>non-racist</i>. Get it? White countries could do same and also get away with it.</p>
<p>Another point. The Japanese invaded China. But now they have gone back to Japan. If Japanese had remained in China, and set up shop there and decided to stay, it would be deeply hypocritical for them to complain about other peoples who might want to also live in such a hypothetical Japanese polity in China. But the Japanese were booted out and went home. 99% of Japanese descended people live in Japan.</p>
<p>But that is not the case with white people - particularly Anglo Saxons. I&rsquo;m sure that probably over 70% of Anglo Saxon Celtic people live <i>outside</i> of the British Isles. You see, they invaded other lands, but unlike the Japanese, did not return &#8216;home&rsquo;. So it is a different story. Get it?</p>

<p>Why is it always that &#8220;Europeans INVADED other lands?&#8221;  Actually, they were starving, many of them.  Their countries had much in the way of fish and game, but anti-poaching laws prevented the peasantry of many countries from feeding their children.  Their were many &#8220;famines&#8221; (crop failures) in Scotland, Ireland, Sweden and others.  The English peasantry were hard-workering, rough living and a far cry from what you probably have in your own predjudiced mine (WASPs like Jeeves and Wooster, probably&hellip;) and these people emigrated to other countries for a better shot at farming some arable land and feeding their families, bettering themselves in some way.  With, I might add, NO WHINING!  No asking for handouts, no demanding to bank in their own native languages or be taught in them, or have any &#8220;special&#8221; demands or social services.  They wanted to be Americans, not to make - change America over to  their new country by conquest such as the Muslims are doing in Europe or the Mexicans in America.  Usually when Europeans &#8220;invaded&#8221; other lands it was as the result of EXPLORING, something an energetic, intelligent, industrious, lively people did - the very opposite of those that were sitting there waiting to be &#8220;invaded&#8221; (chuckle) - which could be viewed as indolent, apathetic, idle, indifferent, flagging, dull, inert, torpid and a million other descriptions for lazy and unconcerned with the world around them.  I think that why people hate Europeans is that old green eyed monster of feeling that we got there FIRST about nearly everything - how convenient that we could be cast as the bad guys nearly everywhere after simply doing what any other people would have done, had they the capability and speed - but somebody beat them to it - dammit!  Curse ye Whitey, foiled again&hellip;.<br/>
So all I can say to your observations is that they are bullshit and spring from envy.  When people watch the bloodlust of black violence, I don&rsquo;t think it is comparable in any way to anything Europeans did.  Neither does Amerindian tortures such as skinning alive, South Seas eating their missionaries as thanks for their troubles, and of course the Chinese tortures called the &#8220;tiger bench&#8221; - lovely.   <br/>
So many people in so many continents BENEFITTED so much from the presence of these savage &#8220;invaders&#8221; (sorry but it makes me roll my eyes).  Invaders makes it sound like they were men and women running in forests with machetes and torches, rather than the skilled men and women setting up missionaries, building churches and hospitals and schools.  You can try and make it sound as bad as you can but the truth remains.  And you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse from a sow&rsquo;s ear.  That is unfortunately still something most Europeans need to learn.  Some people like to wallow in simplicity and are best left there.</p>

<p>Most whites live EXACTLY the way Derbyshire says they should in his piece. And this especially includes white liberals. </p>
<p>Most white liberals do not live in majority black cities, run by blacks, nor do they live in majority black parts of town. Most white liberals do not send their kids to majority black schools. Most white liberals avoid events where most of the people there are black. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>As sad as it is that Derbyshire has lost his job, this episode does contain seeds of opportunity.</p>
<p>The GOP right is falling all over itself to disavow Derbyshire and the Dem left has been equally fast to try to make Derbyshire seem like some sort of spokesman for what conservatives really think and feel behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The opportunity here is to point that these white libs and white cons engaging in their usual partisan scrimmages are really no different at all in the sense that almost ALL of us whites live more or less the way Derbyshire advises. The brilliance of his piece is that practically any white critic of his piece becomes a hypocrite as soon as they open their mouths. Not much consolation in that fact now that he&rsquo;s unemployed, I suppose, but brilliant nonetheless. The least that we Derbyshire supporters can do is to hammer home this point in his defense.</p>

If I recall correclty, this is the same city where Whites burned down the financially successful Black part of town in 1921. In another city, neo-Nazis have vowed to inflict violence on any Black people if necessary.  Such behavior demonstrates that many Whites feel that they can wantonly murder and attack Blacks and other non-Whites without facing any consequences.

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure, Wayne, but I&rsquo;m guessing one difference is that John doesn&rsquo;t beat his Chinese wife, or otherwise abuse her to the point that she is terrified of his violent temper.  Again, you&rsquo;re just being stupidly argumentative since it has been explained to you time and time again that many here are not &#8220;white nationalists,&#8221; but simply race realists.  Your lack of comprehension belies the general stereotype that all Asians are intelligent.  Or maybe you are just the exception to the rule?</p>

<p>I very much doubt if John Derbyshire is, in fact, what you would describe as a &#8216;White nationalist&rsquo;, I doubt if he has an ideological committment to White ethnic genetic interests or any of the other such topics that can be found in the more esoteric recesses of Amren.<br/>
 I would guess that Mr. Derbyshire is a &#8216;liberal&rsquo; in the true sense of the word, in that he tries to see the best in everyone, tries not to &#8216;judge&rsquo; on the basis of their ethnicity people and considers himself to be fair, unprejudiced and reasonable.<br/>
 But, and it&rsquo;s a big but, there is great big fat elephant sitting in the living room, defecating away and causing one hell of a big stink. To pretend this elephant doesn&rsquo;t exist in order to give yourself an easy life is simply not an option to a man of integrity, honesty and vision.<br/>

WW2 and 911 also comes to mind as two examples of the PC way of spreading universal deceit&#8221;<br/>
Very true, very frightening.  It&rsquo;s a must for parents to de-brainwash their kids every day after school.  As far as 9/11, that really freezes my blood.  The whole idea that that story was sold the way it was and the whole idea that people believe it is insane.  The screaming that ensues between people having that discussion causes people not to allow it&rsquo;s discussion in polite society.  People are essentially Cowards because when the topic comes up their eyes shift around the room as if they&rsquo;re being interrogated by their parents.  It&rsquo;s really amazing.  </p>

I don&rsquo;t desire to argue with you&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.  I&rsquo;m very much a person for white rights&hellip;&hellip;. and I understand what white men are going through, I am one and I&rsquo;ve probably gone through more discrimination and job opportunity loss from AA etc than you, since I&rsquo;m older. <br/>
However, I very much admire Asian culture and thought and I don&rsquo;t group them in with the problems I see in the horrible american black culture or the criminal part of the hispanic culture that flaunt our laws&hellip;&hellip;..<br/>
I am not a &#8216;pure&rsquo; white advocate as I don&rsquo;t really understand what that is.  Many of my posts have asked the question about how far white extends as to norwegians vs turkish for example&hellip;&hellip;..<br/>
If you think the extent of Japanese culture is &#8216;slavish obedience to authority&rsquo; then I think you are ignorant on the subject.  Live a little and do some traveling around the world and you might learn something. <br/>
Do you have a problem with &#8216;study habits&rsquo;  or are you just looking for a fight?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78797" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Why is there over 50 minorities living inside China? Well because in spite of overwhelming numbers, and the power to do otherwise, China has encouraged these minorities to thrive. These minorities are far better off than minority groups in the US, have far more generous affirmative action programmes than any in the US, and unlike Han Chinese can have as many children as they want.<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/2enqssjhttp://tinyurl.com/l9879b<br/>
Whereas of course the indigenous under Anglo Saxon and Spanish rule, were basically miscegenated out of existence, or physically exterminated (indigenous of US and Canada abotu 1 to 2%, Australia 1 to 2%, NZ 12%). And even within Europe itself whites have extinguised other whites  &mdash;  where have the Baltic Prussians gone, or the Polabian Slavs, or the Furlanians, Ladins, or Sorbs gone?</p>
<p>China has far more legitimate claim to Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, than whites have to be in the United States. And these claims are older than the histories of white settlments in the Americas and Australasia. In fact the Taiwanese government also recognises these claims, and wants all of Mongolia as well (the PRC settles for Inner Mongolia). Furthermore these claims are recognised as legitimate by the entire international community, in the case of Tibet - the US recognised China&rsquo;s sovereignty as early as 1942. </p>
<p>You talk of ethnic cleansing. Well common sense would tell you that no such thing ever happened. In fact the minorities have grown in numbers over the past 60 years. And are encouraged to do so by not being restricted by the one-child policy.</p>
<p>Also think of this. Tibet had about 1 to 2 million people in 1949. China&rsquo;s population over the Maoist period ranged from 500 to 900 million. Do you think if China&rsquo;s intention <i>really</i> was to ethnically cleanse minority areas, they could not have done so very easily during the first thirty years of the PRC under Mao, and during her most intense period of isolation from the rest of the world. If the Chinese were like Anglo Saxons, the Tibetans, Uighurs, and Mongols would simply have disappeard by now. But instead, the facts are these groups have increased in numbers, and retain their languages, folkways, and customs to a far greater extent than any indigenous peoples under white rule. And have far lower rates of imprisonment (refer work by Barry Sautmann).</p>
<p>White rule for indigenous peoples was mainly a holocaust in the real sense of the word.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78832" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Because of the important megaphone that his association with NR gave him, Derb had a responsibility not to be reckless and play into the hands of the multi-cult left by making sweeping negative group assertions without a way to back it up.  </p>
<p>But then, perhaps emboldened by years of pushing the envelope, he claimed that 5% of blacks have it in for whites and (even worse) that half of blacks will often go along with the 5%&rsquo;s hostile agenda.  If he had not said that he might have gotten away with the article.  Unlike many of the other things he said, which have a basis in empirical data or common sense, he himself admitted that claim was based on nothing more than his own feelings.  </p>
<p>I might believe that one in twenty of any given group (not just blacks but also whites or whoever) might have strong animus toward another given outside group.  But if you&rsquo;re going to say that, especially about a group you single out by name, you need to back it up with credible and preferably peer reviewed numerical evidence; he didn&rsquo;t.  Reckless to the point of arguable slander.  </p>
<p>And as I said, what was worse than that was when he said half of blacks would go along with the supposed 5%. Casting HALF of a given race as willing to join in on injustice and aggression of some kind, in a signed article by a supposedly serious journalist an an article meant for publication, come on.  That&rsquo;s not brave truth-telling.  That&rsquo;s not reciting proven statistics that confound lefty taboos.  That&rsquo;s just stupid, pointless, rudeness, like yelling slurs.</p>
<p>Yes, much of what he said about IQ and crime seemed is nothing new to the well informed, and is solidly backed up by evidence that he provided links to.  He went out of his way to note that the spectrum of human behavior and talent exists in all groups, including that geniuses and the most positive traits and personalities exist among blacks.  In the comments I&rsquo;ve seen about his article I keep running across claims that he claimed that &#8220;all&#8221; blacks are violent or stupid, that&rsquo;s clearly demonstrably false and at least as unfair to him as anything he has been accused of saying about others.</p>
<p>And much of the rest is what amounts to common sense (stuff that is the equivalent of, stay out of Anacostia, or if a &#8220;flash mob&#8221; style event with lots of them suddenly arriving seems to be happening, leave; etc.).  Taboo, and normally not broadcast to a universal audience, but still as he says, the kind of thing most people would try to drill into their naive teenagers especially if they&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated by leftists.  Some of the rest (respond politely but keep moving if someone greets you, don&rsquo;t be a Good Samaritan) is painful but may be wise - the ancedotal evidence he provides (links to crime stories) may be merely anecdotal and un representative but it&rsquo;s pretty compelling.  Arguable at the very least - worthy of stripping a cancer patient of his livelihood?  I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Again, though, just mouthing off and saying that half of blacks are willing to endorse injustice and aggression against whites, that really was a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the worst of all possible worlds.  He put NR in a position of keeping him on and associating themselves with that out-there talk, or looking cowed by firing him.  Also by having gotten himself fired by getting careless, he also helped create a precedent and has made it that much harder for more vulnerable, less established people with un PC views to find or retain employment. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-78846" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You lot are rather pathetic. The US murder rate is now less than half of what it is during the 1930s (when the country was 90% whites and blacks held down), and if blacks are really conducting some sort of race war against whites (which they are most certainly not), it is, statistically speaking a somewhat tepid one.</p>
<p>Given the history of cruel treatment of blacks by whites, not just the lynchings, the castrations, but burnings, the cutting off of fingers and toes and genitals, but the daily overt humiliations up to only a few decades ago, whites have got off pretty easy. All in all blacks are pretty forgiving.</p>
<p>Consider other groups with historical grudges against one another. Here are just three intra-white examples. The Serbs killing Bosniak Muslims. Croats killing Serbs. Ukrainians massacring Poles. </p>
<p>This is extracted from an article on the Urkainiain massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia during WWII:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Villages were torched. Roman Catholic priests were axed or crucified. Churches were burned with all their parishioners. Isolated farms were attacked by gangs carrying pitchforks and kitchen knives. Throats were cut. Pregnant women were bayoneted. Children were cut in two. Men were ambushed in the field and led away. The perpetrators could not determine the province&rsquo;s future. But at least they could determine that it would be a future without Poles&#8221;</p>
<p>Timothy Snyder describes the murders: &#8220;Ukrainian partisans burned homes, shot or forced back inside those who tried to flee, and used sickles and pitchforks to kill those they captured outside. In some cases, beheaded, crucified, dismembered, or disembowelled bodies were displayed, in order to encourage remaining Poles to flee&#8221;.A similar account has been presented by Niall Ferguson, who wrote: &#8220;Whole villages were wiped out, men beaten to death, women raped and mutilated, babies bayoneted.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Almost all of the current borders of Europe were established through large scale ethnic cleansing. Europeans are the most racist people in the world, even among their own, and of course when they come across non-whites they behave even more badly.</p>
<p>Again; blacks have been pretty forgiving of whites. And only whites have carried out mass genocides against other whites. Whites have more to fear from one another than they have to fear from non-whites. The historical record proves this.</p>

The differential rate of blacks victimising Whites as opposed to Whites victimising blacks is enormous, of the order of an order of magnitude or so.<br/>
We are not talking about Europe or Ukraine here - any more than the Tai Ping Rebellion, it&rsquo;s a different issue.<br/>
 In fact Whites volutarily atoned for slavery by fighting a war on behalf of freeing blacks, a war that devastated the states and killed hundreds of thousands of Whites.<br/>
 Contrary to what you write, there never was a mass campaign of Whites, the KKK or whatever killing and mutiliating blacks for te sake of it. A very small number of &#8216;lynchings&rsquo; occurred each years, during the height of &#8216;Jim Crow&rsquo;, and the victims were invariably murderers or rapists (not that I condone extra judicial punishment). The number of such murders were but a tiny fraction of the annual black killing White murder toll that is generally accepted these days, or indeed the toll of black on black murders.</p>

<p>If you have a (viable) alternative, let&rsquo;s hear it. Jared Taylor (and people like him) aren&rsquo;t running, so that&rsquo;s not viable.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-79329" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, that advice to make a token Best Black Friend or two as a talisman against charges of racism was just plain silly.  It didn&rsquo;t work for George Zimmerman, did it?  And he&rsquo;s a genuine True Believer - or was; it remains to be seen whether he&rsquo;s capable of learning from experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Derbyshire ever admitted to being a racist, and especially not a &#8220;homophobe&#8221;. If he&rsquo;s nothing else, he&rsquo;s literate.  &#8220;Homophobe&#8221; is not even a word. If it were, it would mean someone who is afraid of people like himself.  I don&rsquo;t believe such a condition has ever been  identified.</p>
<p>He never said you shouldn&rsquo;t help black people when they&rsquo;re in trouble. He said you shouldn&rsquo;t stop on a highway for black people who appear to be in trouble. That&rsquo;s sound advice.  Many people who didn&rsquo;t live by it, paid with their lives.  Yes, I endorse it wholeheartedly.  I go further.  Avoid all black people, all the time.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m a racist. At least, I&rsquo;m not a fool. And I&rsquo;m not afraid of people like myself, either.</p>
