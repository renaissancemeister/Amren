Review of the film Prometheus.</div> 
</div> 


<p>I recently watched the big-budget sci-fi movie <em>Prometheus</em>, the first sci-fi film directed by Ridley Scott in 30 years. It is a prequel to <em>Alien</em>, which Mr. Scott also directed, and was released in 1979. I was too young to see <em>Alien</em> at a movie theatre, but I watched it on video and liked it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PrometheusLogo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-100137" title="PrometheusLogo" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PrometheusLogo.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="432"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was excited at the prospect of seeing <em>Prometheus</em>. It was the first Hollywood film I&rsquo;d been to see in years, and the first film I&rsquo;d really <em>wanted</em> to see in recent memory. Unfortunately, it is spoiled by even more than the usual Hollywood anti-white stereotyping.</p>
<p><em>Prometheus</em> is the story of a vessel of the same name that has been chartered to travel to the far reaches of the galaxy to a star system that matches cave paintings from ancient cultures on earth. The crew consists of geologists, scientists, company staff, and a robot.</p>
<p>Early in the movie there is an exchange between a geologist and his colleague that sets the racial tone. They are the whitest men on the crew: one with red hair, the other blond. When they wake up after two years of space-travel hibernation, one tried to make friends, but the other hisses &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to make friends; I&rsquo;m here to make money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart sank. One white man is a money-hungry lowlife, and the other a cowardly fool. It reminded me of the old Star Trek series, in which you always knew at the start of an episode which was the unattractive, expendable character who would die soon.</p>
<p>I was right. The two whites are both shown to be cowards as they die horrific deaths early in the film. I thought Ridley Scott was above a lot of this type of cheap filmmaking, but we are left with a black captain, an Asian pilot, two scientists, and Charlize Theron. She is the head of the expedition, but continues the theme of blonde characters who must be calculating and evil. At one point a crew member contracts a virus. She burns him to death with a flamethrower while the black captain shows his virtue by demanding that the man be saved.</p>
<div id="attachment_100136" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Promethus.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-100136" title="Promethus" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Promethus.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="508"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlize Theron and the black ship captain.</p></div>
<p>We continue to a scene in which Charlize Theron is looking at a map, not realizing that the black captain is also in the room also. He bluntly suggests they have sex, and she replies, &ldquo;My room, ten minutes.&rdquo; There has been no flirting previously in the film. The beautiful blonde woman immediately decides to have sex with a black man after a grunted pickup line. This scene seems to have been planted in the movie simply to promote miscegenation.</p>
<p>There is a scene reminiscent of the first <em>Alien</em> film, with a female character in her underwear running for her life from an alien. Eventually, we are left with the Charlize Theron, the black captain, the Asian pilot, and another character who hardly had a speaking part in the film. Their only options are to flee the planet or kill themselves in an effort to take down the alien vessel and save planet Earth. Charlize Theron, being blonde, obviously chooses to flee, and urges the black and Asian to do the same. They are far too heroic and refuse. Charlize Theron rushes to an escape pod and is killed soon after. The black captain and Asian pilot then kill themselves in a heroic act that saves humanity.</p>
<p>I was left wondering whether Ridley Scott really thinks this way or just had to satisfy the PC police. There is nothing really wrong with the script; just ridiculous casting choices. It&rsquo;s almost as if Mr. Scott purposely chose the most unlikely option for each character in order to break stereotypes. Non-whites are always brave and honorable; whites are always craven and selfish.</p>
<p><em>Prometheus </em>may be worth seeing for the special effects alone, but I wonder if the era of decent film making is over. Is this entertainment? Or is it simply propaganda?</p>

Which is actually pretty likely, at least if white people survive long enough to have mastered intergalactic travel, and all the other scientific advancements that go along with it. We&rsquo;re not actually that far from being able to genetically enhance black people now, if we had the political will. We genetically enhance crops easily enough (again, when we have the political will).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes the black people in Sci-Fi behave so black, while the universe bends itself to benefit them as though they were intelligent people doing sensible things, that I can&rsquo;t suspend disbelief any more.</p>

Only one in years I&rsquo;ve even wanted to see was <i>The Hunger Games</i>, and that was only to see how it stacked up to the book.</p>
<p>As an aside, if THG does hold to the book, other than two token blacks it would be about as non-afrocentric as anything I&rsquo;ve seen in ages. Not my primary reason for wanting to see it (didn&rsquo;t); I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>As for entertainment that doesn&rsquo;t reverently deify blacks, try some old episodes of <i>The Shield, The Wire, </i> &amp; <i>Boondocks.</i></p>

<p>What makes that scene so reprehensible to racial realist sensibilities is that it is one of many cogs in the machine that is White genocide.  Taken in isolation, one may mistake it for nothing more than the requisite &#8220;spicy&#8221; moment that &#8220;must&#8221; be inserted in all movies these days to hold the attention of the audience.  However, the sinister ulterior motive, as the author implies, is to-yet again-promote miscegenation.  And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, it&rsquo;s a black man and a blonde White woman!</p>
<p>I find it disgusting and disrespectful, and I will have no part of it.  Anyone on here who reads this article and then goes out to see the movie anyway is a hypocrite (of course, I think better of most of the people on here anyway!)</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99269" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Too bad, I was planning on seeing the movie this weekend.  Now I know better, Thanks AmRen!  How sickening, throwing in a miscegenation scene simply for the sake of throwing one in (knowing that TONS of white people will see this movie).  I absolutely refused to see Avengers.  There&rsquo;s no way I could stand seeing sammy j. muck up the screen for 2 hours.  The last film I saw in the theaters was INCEPTION.  Absolutely ZERO DIEversity in that one (except for the always superb Ken Wantanabe).  Regarding Ridley Scott, I should have seen this coming.  Remember, Gladiator had the Noble Magic Black who fought side by side with Maximus and even buried the figurines of Maximus&rsquo; family after he died as shown in the ending.  What a thoughtful and noble gesture!  WHY RIDLEY WHY?  You would think he has more than enough money and clout to go the Mel Gibson route and just produce and distribute his own films.  Passion of the Christ was one of the highest grossing films of all time.  And you know how &#8220;you know who&#8221; felt about that one!</p>

Afraid of the truth? Go ahead, fret, scoff and frustrate yourself losers! Fact in the intelligence section, the Asians ( Chinese, Indians etc) will overtake the white man, which is evident, the sports is dominated by blacks and browns, and eventually you whites will lose out and be enslaved by your new non white Masters! DIEversity will rule you! Oh and to the moderator - go ahead you low IQ delusional cowards, go ahead and delete my comment. I will still be laughing at you white nationalist clowns, keep making amusing posts about your delusional wishful fantasies about how the white man will survive and take over..LOL.</p>
<p>Oh and btw, there were, are and will always be black and other non white astronauts. I unlike you frustrated envious pathetic white gentile losers, follow facts not fiction!</p>

using a race realist&rsquo;s argument to combat an assumed &#8216;White supremacy&rsquo; ideology.</p>
<p>You agree with inherent differences, but you just think that<br/>
we should never acknowledge these differences unless it&rsquo;s in the context of<br/>
celebrating our own decline, such as you do. Which in the minefield of racial politics<br/>
makes you a White guy who practices &lsquo;nice racism&rsquo; or in other words you&rsquo;re a<br/>
non-white supremacist.<br/>
Phew for a minute there I was worried that may<br/>
be politically incorrect, carry on.<br/>
What&rsquo;s wrong exactly with fighting for your own group&rsquo;s<br/>
cultural or biological preservation?<br/>
For instances the nation which is your namesake,Israel is currently making the news for its plan to deport between 25,000 to 60,000 African immigrants http://tiny.cc/gsavfw .<br/>
What is your high moral opinion on that?<br/>

<p>Here is another world famous African American Quantum Physicist and is well reputed by the scientific community and intellectuals alike for his work and views - Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Of course, you need to actually have a high IQ to appreciate this video where two great intellectuals Dr. Neil De Grasse Tyson and renowned Oxford Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins discuss Science:</p>

<p>No physicist uses the term &#8220;quantum physicist&#8221; - that&rsquo;s a term only used by Hollywood screen-writers who are ignorant of science.  And anyway, Neil DeGrasse Tyson is an astronomer, not a physicist (the two are related, but not the same).</p>
<p>Mr. Tyson has become the public face of astronomy - much as Carl Sagan was.  He is famous because he is on TV, not for any actual discoveries he has made.  As a scientist he is far less consequential than Sagan was.  However as a TV presenter and human being he seems superior to Sagan, who was often just a pretentious ass.  Nothing against Mr. Tyson, but he is not a major figure in science.  And as astronomers go, he is an anomaly - very,very few astronomers are black.</p>

That and racist are YOUR favorite &#8220;insults&#8221; for us. We are NOT ignorant at all. We here at Amren (most of us) are very knowledgeable. (I see you went to Purdue. You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to be one who confuses educated with intelligent do you? You can be both, but it&rsquo;s not a given) YOU are ignorant. YOU have a lack of knowledge. Sure, by &#8220;PC&#8221; standards, we are ignorant. Ignorant in that WE do NOT accept a false truth. WE speak the truth. IF you don&rsquo;t agree with what WE say (the truth), YOU are ignorant. &#8220;PC/RACE IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT&#8221; provides a crutch for weak minded/guilt ridden/self-apologist whites like YOU. WE here at Amren (most of us), are humanitarians. We do NOT wish harm others. WE do NOT hate anyone. WE just love WHITE PEOPLE (OUR people. YOUR people) The longer we &#8220;exist&#8221; together, the more whites will be killed at the hands of the African. The longer we &#8220;exist&#8221; together, the further the black suffers (in his mind) from OUR perceived oppression. We would ALL be better off by ourselves. You think you KNOW ME. YOU think you can label me and guess exactly what type of person I am based on my racial views. I am 21 year old college student. I grew up around people of ALL colors. I have had friends of ALL colors.-Those who are most open to diversity, are the farthest away from it-</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99303" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It would be interesting to see a Hollyweird remake of Birth of A Nation.  I was reading on Wikipedia that the film was &#8220;highly controversial owing to its portrayal of African American men (played by white actors in black face) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan as a heroic force.&#8221;  To me that is an interesting assertion because it shows just how far from the truth we have strayed.  In 1915 the truth was pretty self evident and you could show it as such.  Now, nearly 100 years later, the &#8220;truth&#8221; has been completely inverted to show a false reality.  (well except for black men being sexually aggressive towards white women - but that is a positive right?) </p>

I believe the most offensive anti-white movie I know of was &#8220;Black Snake Moan&#8221;.  That was the film portraying the older black man who kept a young white woman tied up in his yard, bound by a chain and shackle around her neck. I left a comment of what I  thought of that&hellip;needless to say, I was sent a lot of hate mail. I&rsquo;m not sure what the Hollywood folks are trying to prove. They are promoting racial hatred on both sides with their agendas. When I was younger, I was pretty neutral and socially liberal. Exposure to the racial double standard and the extreme hatred of whites by the media have made me extremely angry. Every time I hear of one of these films, I am filled with rage. Hey Hollywood, you are turning white liberals into white nationalists&hellip;good for you. These anti-white movies are a highly effective recruiting tool for Stormfront and David Duke.</p>

Inspired by your post I googled and depressingily just found out that Dan O&rsquo;Bannon (the great American writer/director who wrote the script for Alien http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)#Origins and who played  &rsquo;Penback&rsquo; in John Carpenter&rsquo;s &#8216;Darkstar&rsquo;) passed away in 2009.<br/>

Race realists to me are (amoung other things) futurists, which lends itself to Sci Fi type imagination, unfortunately everything is getting so tainted and having the fun sucked out of it with left wing multicultural anti-merit politicization, so much so that I&rsquo;m sure the first man on Mars will probably be a Bantu for PR purposes (instead of being the race realist White colony that it could/should be).<br/>
&#8216;Moon&rsquo; was the last enjoyable Sci fi film that comes to my mind (Torrent here http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/138239765/moon?tab=summary ).<br/>

This makes me feel even less guilty about using bit torrents, serves Hollywood right for the steaming piles of manure that they&rsquo;re constantly serving up.<br/>
And Charlize Theron to me is (or at least was) one of the most beautiful woman in the world, but then she goes and makes films like this and Hancock and she goes and adopts some cheap Bantu instead of carrying on her own elegant genes, madness. </p>
<p>I was passively watching network TV with my partner the other night (her shows) and seriously every freaking show had a ensemble cast featuring at the least one black, one gay, one hot White woman and a goofy White guy. Looking at promo&rsquo;s for all these singing and dancing &#8216;reality shows&rsquo;  I just couldn&rsquo;t get over how emotional, feminine, expressive and fruity the world must appear now to the younger people coming through (who&rsquo;ll  have no other comparison). </p>

The racial messages are similar in every movie out there (outside of very, very few movies - such as 300) so I was not shocked. Yes, it is irritating that the only manly, man in the movie is black. But his role is not a major one and the Asian has about 4 lines in the whole movie. </p>
<p>Yes the black and the Asian kill themselves to save humanity but the reviewer forgets the white guy (Scottish actor, Emun Elliot) who was with them and similarly sacrificed himself. As far as I can recall, the black and Asian are the only nonwhites in the movie and score about 10-15 minutes of the 2+ hour movie.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you to go see the movie. But the racial messages are not any worse than anything else on TV or at the movies. It&rsquo;s not as good as the first two Alien movies but far better than the previous two.</p>
<p>The acting by rising A-lister Michael Fassbender was wonderful, as was Swedish actress Noomi Rapace. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with corporate honchos.  The new issue of Forbes, for example, has a fawning special section on how American&rsquo;s leading companies are weaving Diversity into all aspects of operations.  Blacks executives who head the &#8220;Division of Diversity and Inclusion&#8221; (or whatever these useless divisions are called) are all aglow about how they impose their mission on all employees.  Frightened white CEOs, and white-owned business magazines like Forbes, go along with this charade.</p>

Attractive white woman that gets with a black dude despite him being the ugliest guy in the movie?  Check.<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99421" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I saw it yesterday and thought it was a collosal disappointment. So far the most overrated movie of the century other than Avatar which was soaked in anti-white cliches. </p>
<p>However, I think this review reads exactly like the anti-white tirades shoveled by http://www.racialiscious.com and other pro-diversity propaganda. It sounds like an awful lot of crying and absurd conclusions about portrayals of race. I didn&rsquo;t even think of half of this stuff while watching it as they are nothing more than imaginary. The one thing I did find insulting was the black captain hooking up with the insanely gorgeous and refined Theron - a scenario so improbably I laughed out loud. The black captain was a joke and seemed to be anything but competent. I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous that the only time Theron breaks from her ice queen persona is to shag King Kong.  </p>
<p>I do agree, though, that the characters were very off-base. Like the &#8220;geologist&#8221; Rafe Spall. At the beginning you think he&rsquo;s gonna be this total badass soldier or mercenary type. When you find out he&rsquo;s a scientist you&rsquo;re like &#8220;HUH?&#8221; He ends up being the movie&rsquo;s biggest coward. So unbelievable that it just takes away from the whole film&rsquo;s integrity. </p>
<p>I would like to say that in defense of white culture, the film casting does have a good selection of talent from white homelands - Theron (S. Africa), Rapace (Sweden), Pierce (England), some Scottish lady, Spall (England), Sean Harris (England), and Fassbender (Germany/Ireland).  </p>

<p>Now, it might well be said that blacks are no worse than any other dangerous predator animal.  Then again, no one is suggesting that we embrace rattlesnakes to our naked breasts, or have a vicious man-eating tiger as a live-in house pet.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99671" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I believe most posters here get upset with the way society seems intent on crushing white culture. Out of that they strike out at other races, particularly those that are seen as being the tools used to crush their own culture. It&rsquo;s the politicalization of race relations that is putting us at each other&rsquo;s throats, most likely as an intentional tool. If we could get past that, perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary for a racial divide. As things stand now, though, it&rsquo;s hard to see whether that&rsquo;s true or not. I&rsquo;ll pull the classic &#8220;I have black friends,&#8221; but it is true. And, frankly, they&rsquo;re a whole lot like me and nothing like the hip-hop gangsters used by the elites to destroy my down-home white culture. But my black friends are not like ALL blacks, and I&rsquo;m not like ALL whites, because we&rsquo;re all individuals. </p>
<p>Of course we&rsquo;re not all equal. That much is clear. But that doesn&rsquo;t make any one individual superior over any other individual. And, regardless, we all should be guaranteed equal political rights. It&rsquo;s at that point that the government&rsquo;s involvement in our lives should end. Instead, the government is teaching our children that they should hate certain of their fellow citizens (for past injustices, they say) and that it&rsquo;s those citizens&rsquo; fault they don&rsquo;t have all the material goods society might possibly offer. But we don&rsquo;t know what race relations might be in the absence of the influence of that tool. Blacks and whites can, and do, get along on an individual basis, and I&rsquo;d hate to lose that all because some elitists gain an economic advantage by playing the &#8220;let&rsquo;s you and him fight&#8221; game.  </p>

It&rsquo;s not really society that is pitting whites against blacks, its the other way around. We are different, simply put. Sure, all the anti-white spew doesn&rsquo;t help black on white relations, at all. Let say &#8220;it&#8221; all ended tomorrow, sure, things would get better, but not much. We will both find something else to harp on. Most people on here watch the news every night. What do we see? Black on black crime/black on white crime. Each day/EVERY day/Each city. That has nothing to do with an anti-white doctrine. In fact, it actually hurts it.</p>

<p>A more talented director might have made something of the irony that she is biracial and giving birth to a&hellip; more biracial&hellip; offspring.</p>
<p>Personally I give this review a &#8220;meh&#8221;. La diversité est conflit&rsquo;s rebuttal above is worth reading. Was there PC in this movie? Sure. But not everything is worth getting upset about. I just rolled my eyes at the PC parts&hellip; but I rolled my eyes more at the script.</p>
<p>Prometheus was the third best Alien movie. It was a fun waste of time. But I won&rsquo;t be buying the DVD.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99472" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There was a program on HBO and BRAVO called &#8220;Project Greenlight&#8221; that sheds light on casting of film.</p>
<p>The screenwriter writes the script. The writer may even write for specific characters (ie White). It&rsquo;s picked up by director who has his own concept of the film and the casting (which again can be all white characters). The director then has to get financing and this is where the trouble begins.</p>
<p>The financial backers run the show and they make all the calls. &#8216;If you want our money, you will have to make the film in our image&rsquo;. The financiers base their decisions by calculating which racial/ethnic cast will bring the biggest box office receipts.</p>
<p>So while the screenwriter may have written a screenplay for an all white cast and the director signs on to the screenwriters vision, it&rsquo;s the financiers who have the final say on casting. They can pay for a big name star if they believe it will increase ticket sales (even if the choice is all wrong to the writer and director) and they&rsquo;re the ones who demand multi-racial casts in the belief that they&rsquo;ll increase their demographic share.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why independent films are most likely to have homogeneous characters.    </p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right- 112 people have been killed by sharks in the United States since 1642. In over approximately 350 years, 112 human beings have been killed by sharks in the United States.</p>
<p>Are you scared of sharks? You should be. They&rsquo;re monster-like aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>How many white people have been killed by blacks/mexicans in that same time period? Quite a bit more than 112 don&rsquo;t you think? </p>
<p>When you go out at night, what are you afraid of? Vampires? Werewolves? Sharks? No, if you&rsquo;re like me or anyone else with more than half of a brain, you fear being attacked by blacks or our neighbors to the south. And with good cause. Let&rsquo;s just say, I don&rsquo;t carry a harpoon gun. </p>

<p>-The uber-villains in this film, the &#8220;engineers&#8221;, are big, muscular bald White Men. By the end its the White men vs. the heroic minority representatives.</p>
<p>-Of the the 3 White men on the Prometheus&rsquo; crew, 2 are cawardly simpletons who are killed off, the other is a naive nerd who gets poisoned by:<br/>
 -The Aryan-esque robot who strives to look like Lawrence of Arabia&rsquo;s stunt double.</p>
<p>-The only other White man in this film is the Prometheus&rsquo; owner, played by a poorly make-up&rsquo;d Guy Pierce, who, it is revealed, is only exploiting the crew to find resources to extend his own life.</p>
<p>-Charlize Theron is the typical White woman in a Hollywood production: a jungle-fever sex-machine with no sense of loyalty or morals; just the way the Chosen One&rsquo;s like them. </p>

<p>All Hollyweird types are enamored with the idea that a black guy can do things better than a white because he&rsquo;s more MANLY. It&rsquo;s the image constructed by media jewery (inspired by Frankfurt School intellectuals): The white male is a weak/cowardly/sycophantic/money-grubbing/drug-addled/drink-besotted/wife-abusing etc, etc . . . non-man . . . while the heroic and wise black male struggles to overcome injustice and the disadvantages of slavery as he raises his young son into adult-hood (while the black mom works on her Doctorate in Nuclear Medicine) . . . cut to commercial . . . the black dad explains how he escaped the gang life as he fixes dinner . . . and so on . . .</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enought to make a white man&rsquo;s head explode, but really, what else can you do if you&rsquo;re a Hollyweird mogul? You can&rsquo;t very well show blacks in their natural habitat . . . murdering, raping and robbing each other (as well as any unlucky white who makes a wrong turn). </p>
<p>I always thought the most accurate black portrayal was the Tarzan movie. Of course, those were the good-old days of Hollywood . . .</p>

Each film depicts white men as heroic figures. Of course the notion that white men are heroic figures could not be tolerated in politically correct Hollywood. It seems that Scott has been trying to make amends with the Hollywood elite ever since. Although I was planning on seeing Prometheus, I won&rsquo;t see it now. If you want to see a great Ridley Scott film, see Gladiator or Black Hawk Down. They appear to be the high water mark of his film making  career.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lindelof is a native of Teaneck New Jersey , where he attended Teaneck High School , a school whose diverse student body he credits with expanding his horizons as a writer.] He celebrated his Bar Mitzvah  in Teaneck, where he would join his family at synagogue for the Sabbath, and recounted how the fact that &#8220;I was a Jewish white kid growing up in Teaneck, but at the same time, I had African and Filipino and Asian friends and to have that experience all through high school while getting an awesome education was wonderful.&#8221; Lindelof has stated that he is a lifelong supporter of the Democratic party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, if I might stretch my Sherlock powers even further, I would add that he is not married, and it is physically impossible to find any information on any girlfriends on the interwebs. Oh noes, I think he might be a little light in the loafers. </p>
<p>To sum up my findings: Oy Vey! He&rsquo;s Gay!<br/>
Mystery solved. I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p>Whilst I do not particularly go to the cinema these days (perhaps something to do with being a white-advocate - hence increased social outcast! - and being principled and aware of who and what I am going to be funding/supporting by going), I do like Sci-Fi films and hoped this one would be half decent. </p>
<p>Now, I do not think I will bother with it even when it comes on to the terrestrial TV in a few years. Much like I avoid Avatar and a stack of others which are part of an agenda. </p>

Perhaps the only film from that genre- if we neglect the recent Mallick&rsquo;s movie- that will survive is Kubrick&rsquo;s Odyssey. The best of the rest (Alien series, Matrix series, Star Wars, &hellip;) are watchable, but superficial- despite pretensions of depth some of them claim to possess.<br/>
And yes- Tarkovsky&rsquo;s &#8220;Stalker&#8221; will survive.</p>
<p>Most other sci fi films are either obsolete or outright hilarious. Why the heck those troopers are killing all those bugs with something like automatic rifles &amp; never use howitzers of MLRS ?<br/>
I bet &#8220;Prometheus&#8221; is, apart from agitprop, full of silly mistakes &amp; laughable situations. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99649" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> I assume you&rsquo;re referring to Starship Troopers, which is probably one of the worst adaptations of a novel I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The book is nothing like the film - the director apparently thought it was boring and depressing, so he decided the film should be a satire (&#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand this, so I&rsquo;ll mock it instead&#8221;). The novel has a number of well-written insights and arguments on subjects relating to military service, human nature, and the rights and responsibilities of individuals in a society. I have yet to read a criticism of the novel that accurately pins the claims of racism, fascism and military fetishism to anything other than the reviewer&rsquo;s own fantasies.</p>

Yes - it&rsquo;s satire, I mentioned that. I&rsquo;m saying I think that was a poor choice for the director to make, as it ignored or distorted a lot of good ideas and replaced them with a cartoon about liberal stereotypes.</p>

<p>Old Hollywood people,whatever I may object to their lifestyles, nevertheless did possess some kind of integrity &amp; real life in them (Clark Gable, John Wayne, Errol Flynn, Bette Davis, Gary Cooper, Greta Garbo, Katherine Hepburn,..).</p>
<p>But, these &#$&#8221;?ß are beyond remedy. If this woman does not have a maternal instinct- fine, live your life with cats or dogs or whatever. If she does &amp; is afraid or doesn&rsquo;t want for whichever reasons to have her own biological child- fine, adopt a baby.</p>
<p>BUT- adopt a boy or a girl who is in some way like you, visually &amp; try to be a good mom. maybe you&rsquo;ll succeed to connect, to raise a child who will love you &amp; be loved in return.<br/>
JUST- don&rsquo;t sell me &amp; other mentally sane people that adopting a small human being you have nothing in common with &amp; who is out of place as Kunta Kinte is in the orchestra playing Mozart&rsquo;s Jupiter symphony- is something I could sincerely believe in as a display of &#8220;motherhood&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s better that way. This is cruel, but I prefer a Bantu life ruined by a worthless slut than a White child placed in such an environment. Sorry, my universal humanism has long since evaporated.</p>

of hateful, nefarious and sometimes murderous intent.</i></p>
<p>Big difference:  &#8220;Murderous intent&#8221; is rampant among NBPP leadership, but it&rsquo;s shunned by AR leadership (read:  Jared Taylor).  If you do read any &#8220;murderous intent&#8221; in these forums, I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t stay up very long.</p>
<p><i>Primarily because I have a relatively large amount of interactivity with<br/>
minorities and 9.8 times out of 10 it is simply an average,<br/>
run-of-the-mill, quaint interaction.</i></p>
<p>Is that supposed to be comforting?  The big problem is the 0.2 times out of ten when it&rsquo;s not quaint.  Also, just because it is quaint 9.8 of 10 times doesn&rsquo;t mean &#8220;minorities&#8221; (read:  blacks and most Hispanics) can build desirable first-world societies on their own volition.</p>
<p>Rhetorical question:  It&rsquo;s 10 PM at night.  You have no choice but to leave your house, walk a quarter mile to some place, then walk back.  You have to do it, not doing it is not an option.  Would you rather do it in the worst white trash neighborhood imaginable, or an average black neighborhood?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99665" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> I generally agree with you, and share your circumstances in terms of having friends who are not entirely of my own race. However I think this tends to break down when considered in societal scales rather than personal ones. </p>
<p>For multiculturalism to work, everyone must buy into it and participate in full. Yet we sit separately, reside separately, tend to marry and procreate separately, all along racial lines. I&rsquo;m excluded from certain college scholarships, volunteer opportunities and internships where the qualification lists all races except white, but I&rsquo;m told race does not exist. In high school, students wrote &#8220;brown pride&#8221; or &#8220;black pride&#8221; on their backpacks without a problem; the one student who wrote &#8220;white pride&#8221; was instantly suspended. Attempting to discuss these things usually labels me either as a cracker, racist, or just ignorant. Et cetera. </p>
<p>Clearly not everyone is participating equally. Nevertheless I&rsquo;m required, through taxes, laws and social standards, to support a method of thinking that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be in my best interests. What&rsquo;s more, on the individual scale of people like you and I, removing this social obligation would probably have little effect on our ability and right to correspond and support each other based simply on our mutual interests and shared primary culture. I think people here (AmRen) have a problem with race because people &#8220;out there&#8221; have a problem with race, or rather, just with my race. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think returning to segregation or murdering anyone is the answer to this, but multiculturalism in its current form is too heavily reliant on the meme of evil whites, who need be either shamed, bullied or legislated out of existence. </p>

<p>I am glad I read your review.  When I saw that the Captain was black I had a strange feeling that the film had the PC Approval Certificate.    </p>
<p>I wanted to watch the film FOR GREATER GLORY.  Within 50 miles of my residence in NJ, only one theater was showing this film.  It was being shown once each day at 10:30 am in the morning.   Is this censor ship like in Liberal Nazi Germany or Liberal USSR?</p>
<p>The Liberals did the same thing to the Atlas Shrugged film.  </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-99923" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Of course you enjoyed the film, you&rsquo;re not White.</p>
<p>roots - That&rsquo;s rich.  You people have tons of your own thing but we can&rsquo;t even have one.  You even have your own little congresses (congressional black/hispanic/asian caucus) that seek to help ONLY y&rsquo;alls own.  White People pay taxes too yet we have no congress seeking the betterment for us like y&rsquo;all do.  And it&rsquo;s worth noting, those people vote on laws that White People must adhere to yet they don&rsquo;t work for White People, they work for their own kind.  Is that fair?</p>
<p>hateful/nefarious/murderous - How dare you.  White People have every Right, every Right to be upset, fed up and even angry.  We have been under assault from you non-whites from day one and now you want to cry &#8220;hate&#8221; and call us nefarious and murderous because we dare to write down our frustrations.  You dare to come here and slander us yet make NO MENTION of the black panther calling for the death of cracka&rsquo;s and their White Babies.  Now that is nefarious and filled with murderous intent but not according to you, no, you only see that here.  This is a part of the reason why I won&rsquo;t deal with you non-whites.  You can&rsquo;t even allow us to write down our feelings but a black man can stand at a podium and call for our death.</p>
<p>multiculturalism - You&rsquo;re not White so you will never be able to understand.  It&rsquo;s not your Country (Africa) and neighborhoods that are being flooded, it&rsquo;s ours.  I don&rsquo;t want a non-white to be my pharmacist, doctor, mailman, politician, teacher, neighbor or friend.  It&rsquo;s never the non-white who must be &#8220;sensitive&#8221; and &#8220;tolerant&#8221; and it&rsquo;s never the non-white who must deny their culture, it&rsquo;s always and only White People who must do that.  Do you really have to question why some White People just might be a little annoyed?</p>
<p>Non-whites viciously attack and viciously murder White People all the time yet there are never any hate crime charges applied and add insult to injury, we get lectured on tolerance and told how racist we are and told not to judge yet when a White Person merely hangs a dead animal from a tree, they go to prison.  Non-whites get tons and tons of Minority Privilege for doing nothing but being a non-white and White People are forced to pay for it.  We don&rsquo;t get to choose where our tax dollars go so we&rsquo;re forced to pay to have our very own Country discriminate against us simply because we&rsquo;re White.  If non-whites were forced to pay for stuff only White People qualified for, you people would be screaming racism louder than you ever have before and you&rsquo;d be demanding it stop immediately and ya know what?  You&rsquo;d get your way too but not us.  Just simply asking for Affirmative Action to go away is cause for calling a White Person racist.  Some of us are just right sick and tired of it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that is nefarious and filled with murderous intent but not according to you, no, you only see that here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually he noted seeing &#8220;murderous intent&#8221; both in AR comments and from the BPP.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I read many of the comments on this site and when I speak to many<br/>
in organizations like the BPP, there is often an undeniable undercurrent<br/>
of hateful, nefarious and sometimes murderous intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, when you suggest that this is &#8220;not [his] country&#8221; - I suspect Africa is his &#8220;country&#8221; as much as Scotland and Germany are mine - that is to say, they aren&rsquo;t. If Randy considers himself first and solely an American, and his politics don&rsquo;t promote racial destruction, I&rsquo;d say he has as much reason to consider this his country as I do, and we&rsquo;re better off with him here.</p>

<p>- That&rsquo;s a huge &#8220;if&#8221;.  Chances are he considers himself an African-American, which is quite different than being an American.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;and his politics don&rsquo;t promote racial destruction,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>- In the long run, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  A primary reason for the decline of the While world is simply the proximity we have to non-Whites.  Humans do not exist in a state of racial separateness when we are in contact with others not of the same race.  Given a peaceful, multiracial state, even if no one in the group promotes racial destruction, the end result will be the demise of the White race.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d say he has as much reason to consider this his country as I do, and we&rsquo;re better off with him here.&#8221; (I would not prestage this with an &#8220;if&#8221; statement.  I think Blacks deserve a nationstate here just as much as do Whites.)</p>
<p>- In any case, I agree with the first part of this comment, about this being his country as much as it is mine.  As neither of us can truly &#8220;go home&#8221; though, I think the races should now have separate nations within what is now the United States.  As for Whites being better off with Blacks being here, I would have to disagree. </p>

<p>Evan, you move him into your house.  You live with him.  I always did say White People were going to split and you confirm that for me.  There are people like you who like your good little minorities and always wish to make exceptions and then there are people like me who just want to be left the hell alone already!  I don&rsquo;t need a good minority in my neighborhood just because they call themselves American or have never committed crime.</p>
<p>For me, I have never seen a minority not demand privilege of some sort.  There are either not enough people here who look like them or they need representation from their own stock or they need their extended family here or they want to race mix with White People or there are too many White People in powers of position or too many White People have all the best jobs or they want their non-white culture imported because it&rsquo;s their culture or&hellip;.</p>
<p>White People need to go their own separate ways.  Those of us who wish to be around only our own shall be allowed to have it and the rest of y&rsquo;all can live with your exceptions.</p>

<p>(font and boldness copied over because I simply copied &amp; pasted yours)  For me, I don&rsquo;t connect writing to action.  Yes, some people write before acting but wouldn&rsquo;t those types have blown a gasket writing or no writing anyway?  Either you&rsquo;re prone or you&rsquo;re not? (that was written with no thought to circumstance (self defense).  And Sir, you know we&rsquo;re not nuts here and you know we&rsquo;re not about to listen to some kook telling us to do whatever.  I cannot help but defend all forms of Speech.  This includes allowing muslims to tell us their full intention is to either kill us or enslave us and I say back, over my dead body!</p>
<p>Now, not knowing as you do, I don&rsquo;t dispute you.  Perhaps I really would be surprised.  Still, I have a tendency to believe that at times, because all we can see are printed words, sometimes we mistake the feelings behinds them.</p>

me of Independence Day when you had a black and a Jew head into the<br/>
mothership.  The Jew I was okay with.  Okay, I thought Will Smith was<br/>
funny (I have GOT to get me one&rsquo;a THESE!) but looking back&hellip;having a<br/>
black was a bit unrealistic.  He was just good for the wisecracks.&#8221;He wasn&rsquo;t even good for the wisecracks. He was boring in ID.  He was boring in &#8220;Men in Black&#8221;.   Will Smith&rsquo;s performances span the whole gamut from &#8220;annoying&#8221; to &#8220;ridiculous&#8221;. He  has to be one of the smuggest, least entertaining, least funny actors in Hollywood.</p>

When the largest number of contributors ceased being &#8216;techie&rsquo; White Authors, and started to be populated with non-Anglo, non-European authors (Do I need to be more specific?) we began to be barraged with anti-Western, Anti-white, and (of course) Anti-Christ propaganda, as &#8216;sci-fi.&rsquo; I lost interest in the genre at about 12 yrs. of age- which is about when most intelligent people should stop reading comics and other pre-adolescent garbage. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; that was about when the third (and worst) season of Star Trek was on the TV, with who in the limelight? Roddenberry, Shatner, Nimoy. What do they all have in common?

I worked in television for a while and I can tell you that this is pretty much the way it is now (and of course TV is controlled predominantly by the same ethnic group as Hollywood). </p>
<p>I worked on a reality show and it was almost blocked because there were no Black contestants in one episode. We did have an Amerind contestant in that episode, and all of the other episodes had at least two Blacks. But because this one episode didn&rsquo;t have any they almost blocked the entire series from airing. But we fought long and hard and in the end the censors let it air. But that is an example of how extreme things have become. </p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up about Prometheus though because I did intend on seeing it, but I will skip it now. Where it&rsquo;s my choice I am done financing the destruction of my race.</p>

Why does the illuminati have a fascination with miscegenation? It&rsquo;s rather complicated and hard to believe, but it has something to do with the tribes of Israel. OK- apparently, the white Europeans are one of the REAL tribes of Israel. They don&rsquo;t like the fact that we white Euros are the real tribes of Israel so they want to dilute the tribe. They HATE us- they discredit us, they murder us, they destroy us: The &#8220;Jooz&#8221; of today SAY they are, but they are not (Rev 3:9<br/>
Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie-..) they are in fact Khazars, or was we know them today Ashkenazi jooz. The frizzy haired, hook nosed, money lenders we were warned of from the Bible. This very group, along with NON-jooz, make up the illuminati, who are directly responsible for the evil underworld that runs this world. They have infiltrated EVERY thing- schools, the church (any 5013 (C) I&rsquo;d say) anyone in high places. They are those that have Mammon as their God. You, as a person, either worship one or the other. There IS no middle ground, whether you&rsquo;d like to believe that you are not one or the other. THAT is the lie perpetrated by THEM- that there IS no God. There is, and he is angry, and he&rsquo;s coming soon.</p>

Fart jokes, sick pedophilia type jokes a la Seth MacFarlane (total illuminati shill of the WORST degree- downright foul) are the plan. For more information, please read &#8220;Pawns in the Game&#8221; by WG Carr which explains this illuminati plan in detail, along with descriptive explanations and motives behind modern comic books, toys, and indoctrinations of schools. PDF books are online free. Another in depth study is &#8220;Satan-Prince of This World&#8221; aka The Synagogue of Satan. Highly recommended- both free PDFS on web. People in high places are almost ALL compromised by this conspiracy, by blackmail using sex films and pedophilia.

Wonder what blackmail they&rsquo;ve got on HER (ugh- i dont wanna know) cheers guys, take care and watch out, anything you say/comment on WILL be used against you (me) and since I have been commenting on sites regarding this, I assure you I have not heard the last of it, in fact have been duly warned to &#8220;shhh&#8221; and you will too.

<div id="dsq-comment-body-101165" class="dsq-comment-body">
<div id="dsq-comment-message-101165" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here&rsquo;s the paradox. White males(at least the geniuses and enterprising among them), by having created a world of plenty-at least in Western nations-freed most people from &#8216;want&rsquo; of basic necessities, and so most white people are more into stuff that excites than stuff that they need. People are animals after all, and just like animals, once basic needs are met, humans want fun, thrilling, orgasmic, and etc. stuff. <br/>
For example, an alarm clock, toothpaste, shampoo, toilet, electrical wires, gas oven, and etc are more necessary for good life than rap music, internet porn, and sports. But even though we NEED all the many stuff created by white males, we don&rsquo;t think much about them because they are utilitarian than sensual in nature; they don&rsquo;t engage our emotions or senses. I mean concrete has done wonders for civilization, but who gets all excited about a sack of concrete or cement? <br/>
Everyday, we wake up, use soap and clean water, and use oven to cook stuff-all thanks to the genius of white males-, but they don&rsquo;t engage our imagination, desire, thrill, and excitement. So, while tons of stuff that white guys made are very useful to us as modern people, the eternal-animal inside us still looks for thrills. Since most whites have been liberated from &#8216;want&rsquo; by white man&rsquo;s technology, most whites are looking for orgasmic pleasures, and in this competition, Negroes beat whites. Negroes are better at sports, sing louder and deeper, are more muscled, more &#8216;charismatic&rsquo;, more commanding-voiced, more masculine, and etc. </p>
<p>In the past, most white people were poor and their minds were on survival; so, their minds were more on basic necessity/morality than thrill. Today, most white people are well-fed and don&rsquo;t have to worry about survival; and so they go lookng for thrills&hellip; and they find more of it from Negroes. </p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s the problem of black violence and crime, but whites(the feminine race relative to blacks) are so obsessed with black masterfulness that they can&rsquo;t shake their thrill-addiction to blackkness. It&rsquo;s like feminists constantly remind the sisterhood all about male violence against women-and it&rsquo;s true that most sexual violence is male on female among all races and in all nations-, but women are still attracted to men because they seek orgasmic thrill by submitting to men. So, women risk male violence because they are excited by manhood and sexual thrills. It&rsquo;s a biological addiction. Just like junkies take risks just to get another high, women take risks with men cuz they just gotta have that orgasm. </p>
<p>Similarly, though the white nationalists warns white people of black violence(just like feminists warn women of male violence), the &#8216;female&rsquo; white race is just too much in love with the &#8216;male&rsquo; black race. White girls are crazy about BIG muscled Negroes, and white boys have &#8216;male orgasms&rsquo; when they watch the feats of black athletes. I remember going to a bar when the Bulls were playing for the championship. Whenever Jordan slammed a dunk, white boys in the bar would go out of their minds, as if they were having orgasms by submitting to the superior Negro. It&rsquo;s like Chris Matthews getting thrills up his legs from listening to Obama talk. Now, Obama is, as black males go, rather dweeby. But if Obama has such effect on white boys, imagine what effect real tough Negro dudes have. White race is thus finished. </p>
<p>So, white male genius paved the way for white addiction to the funkier and more thrilling black race.</p>

The beautiful blonde woman immediately decides to have sex with a black man after a grunted pickup line. This scene seems to have been planted in the movie simply to promote miscegenation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe you guys are out of touch but this kind of hook-up sex between black males and white females is now very common in colleges and the military.  And it&rsquo;s due to natural forces.  Women like tough manly men, and black men are tougher than white men. Men like pretty women, and white women are prettier than black women.  If you mix pitbulls and beagles in the same room, male pitbulls will beat up male beagles and hump female beagles big time.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136326" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Oh, it&rsquo;s all propaganda now.  As much as I love Doctor Who, they&rsquo;ve started sticking in weird gratuitious homosexual references this season,  and have been sticking blacks and East Indians in weird places for a while now (how does the Queen of England wind up black?  That would be &#8220;Liz 10&#8243;.)  And then you have the IMDB boards with weirdos thinking the Doctor should regenerate as a black, an East Indian, or a woman (and as a woman, no, I don&rsquo;t want a femdoc.)</p>
<p>Check out the boards, you may find me on there.  You&rsquo;ll know who I am.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad I don&rsquo;t watch very much at all any more.  I&rsquo;d rather play video games with furry humanoids in, it&rsquo;s much more satisfying than watching TV any more.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-136345" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> Given how large the Universe is, and how many planets have already been discovered (granted, big, obvious ones like Jupiter) - it&rsquo;s unlikely that Earth is the only home to some sort of life.  Granted, other life will not likely be like Earth-life, and if there are other technological species out there, it&rsquo;s highly doubtful that such beings would look like hairless apes (a la Star Trek and most other low-budget sci-fi.)</p>
<p>Just because we see no spaceships zinging overhead doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t  other life out there. It just means that RL technological limitations means we probably will never meet in person - even if SETI does eventually pick up the equivalent of a radio commercial from somewhere out there.</p>

He even carried the typical blackish accent, making him look an outcast on a ship full of intellectuals. It&rsquo;s incredible how the non-whites accepted their deaths, rather, they simply didn&rsquo;t care, dying was irrelevant. </p>
<p>Them laughing about killing themselves and &#8220;savin da world&#8221; ruined the movie for me. What&rsquo;s also hilarious is that in the year 2089 white people will be a TINY TINY minority, and I doubt space technology will be anywhere as advanced.</p>

White people devise plans of hatred and destruction. Black people correct their wrongs and amend them with virtue and skill. A load of BS. When will Hollywood quit the Hollywood driven character device of cowardly Whites and saintly Negroes. If you are going to do Science Fiction, let&rsquo;s have more science and less fiction.</p>
