<div class="intro-paragraph">
A hilarious look at the grim reality of Detroit.</div> 
</div> 


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Paul Kersey, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1468138537/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1468138537">Escape from Detroit: The Collapse of America&rsquo;s Black Metropolis</a>, SBPDL Books, 2012, 370 pp., $11.51 (soft cover)</strong></p>
<p>In 21st century America, laugher is sometimes the only way to keep from crying. This is especially true in the case of what was once the &ldquo;Paris of the West,&rdquo; the city of Detroit, and there is no more thorough, devastating, and hilarious critique of the city and its myths than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1468138537/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1468138537"><em>Escape from Detroit</em></a><em>, </em>from Paul Kersey of StuffBlackPeopleDontLike.com.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1468138537/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1468138537"><em>Escape from Detroit</em></a><em> </em>is a compilation of Mr. Kersey&rsquo;s articles on what was once one of the most cultured, productive, and prosperous cities in the country. To begin with the worst, the book is uneven &mdash; there are occasional typos and formatting errors, and a jerky pace that comes from the stand-alone nature of internet postings. Mr. Kersey clearly writes in bursts of passion, and he would have benefitted from a professional editor.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1468138537/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1468138537"><em>Escape from Detroit</em></a><em>, </em>almost despite itself, combines these disparate commentaries into a cohesive whole that blows apart every assumption underlying how our society works. Mr. Kersey combines his investigative reporting with the illumination of theoretical concepts. Chief among them is his concept of Black Run America (BRA), a term which takes on new meaning in the Age of Obama. Mr. Kersey does not mean that blacks literally rule America &mdash; though they are running such things as the Department of Justice and the Washington DC Metro, with predictable results. What he means is that in America &ldquo;every institution is entirely devoted to protecting and promoting the interests of Black people above all others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more relevant than in Detroit, a center of black political power since the 1974 election of Coleman Young, to whom Mr. Kersey lovingly dedicates this book. Mr. Young perfectly exemplified the &ldquo;we win, they lose&rdquo; mentality of many black politicians by noting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Negro first and a Democrat second.&rdquo; His election set the tone for the kind of mismanagement Detroit would enjoy for years to come.</p>
<p>A city on the verge of bankruptcy that was considering closing 18 out of 23 branches of the public library recently spent $1,092 each for 20 new chairs for one library branch. The public school system spends more than $15,000 per pupil each year but the population is almost 50 percent illiterate. This is not surprising, since the former president of Detroit Public Schools, Otis Mathis, was barely literate. He resigned after allegedly fondling himself in meetings with other school officials.</p>
<p>Mr. Kersey also makes it clear that blacks have no one to blame but themselves. He frames the story of Detroit with two images. The first is a statue of the Spirit of Detroit, which was dedicated in 1958 and symbolized God and family &mdash; appropriate themes for a prosperous white American city. The second image is the Joe Louis memorial, a giant bronze fist that commemorates the &ldquo;Brown Bomber&rdquo; who knocked out Max Schmeling in 1938 in what was widely interpreted as a victory for the black race. As Mr. Kersey notes, Detroit is the closest thing America has to a city where white people simply do not matter. The fist of black power rules, figuratively and literally.</p>
<div id="attachment_100078" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/EscapeFromDetroit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-100078 " title="EscapeFromDetroit" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/EscapeFromDetroit.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The &quot;Spirit of Detroit&quot; and the &quot;Brown Bomber.&quot;</p></div>
<p>Of course, conservatives don&rsquo;t understand what that means. Rush Limbaugh famously blamed Detroit&rsquo;s failures on &ldquo;liberalism.&rdquo; Thomas Sowell would blame unions and &ldquo;statist&rdquo; economic policies; the late Jack Kemp was convinced that Enterprise Zones that would save Detroit. Mr. Kersey delights in puncturing these absurd theories, pointing out that the similarly union- and Democrat-dominated city of Pittsburgh &mdash; with its large white majority &mdash; is widely considered one of the best places to live in America.</p>
<p>Liberals blame Detroit&rsquo;s decline on the collapse of the American auto industry, but Mr. Kersey notes that Pittsburgh seems to have recovered rather well from the decline of the steel industry. Detroit&rsquo;s failure or salvation is not a matter of the Invisible Hand, but what Mr. Kersey calls the Visible Black Hand of Economics.</p>
<p>The system has tried to postpone collapse as long as possible. The Obama Administration&rsquo;s bailout of the auto industry, federal welfare programs, and giant wealth transfers from the productive white areas of Michigan are all attempts to delay the inevitable. We are also treated to hilarious advertisements with celebrities such as Eminem and Clint Eastwood that try to boost Detroit&rsquo;s image as a comeback city. Rachel Maddow runs pieces on the budding scientists and astronauts who would surely emerge from Detroit&rsquo;s schools, if only we could get them a bit more money, just one more time. The propaganda never ends.</p>
<p>Despite it all, the crisis in what was once the Motor City is coming to a head. Detroit has barely avoided an outright takeover by the state as it flirts with bankruptcy. As expected, the debate in the mainstream media has not been about the city government&rsquo;s incompetence, but the racial ramifications of a white Republican state government administering a black, Democratic city. &ldquo;Michigan is the new Mississippi,&rdquo; warns one writer.</p>
<p>As Mr. Kersey points out, this is essentially correct. Like Mississippi, a substantial black population needs white leadership. Detroit headlines continue to scream about the inability of police to perform basic duties and even the city&rsquo;s inability to keep the streetlights on.</p>
<p>Mr. Kersey is not dealing with metapolitics, political philosophy, or abstract theorizing, but with the practical results of ignoring reality. Ideas have consequences, as establishment conservatives are fond of saying, and there is no more important concept than the one Sam Francis destroyed his career by expressing: &ldquo;The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people.&rdquo; Or, as Mr. Kersey puts it, the death of Detroit was sealed &ldquo;because Black people lacked the ability to innovate on their own. They lacked the ability even to sustain the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Detroit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-100103" title="MoS2 Template Master" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Detroit.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="417"/></a></p>
<p>As the mainstream media broadcasts the news that the majority of births in the United States are now to non-whites, &ldquo;colorblind&rdquo; conservatives and what Mr. Kersey calls Disingenuous White Liberals are betting that the civilization that was created in North America can somehow be transferred to peoples that had nothing to do with creating it and do not identify with it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1468138537/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=americrenai0f-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1468138537"><em>Escape from Detroit</em></a><em> </em>is about the practical consequences of this illusion: the ruin of what was once one of the great cities of the world. Detroit is never coming back; it is a monument to decades of willful ignorance about the facts of racial reality.</p>
<p>Dreary as this all is, I believe it is cause for optimism. As Mr. Kersey says, &ldquo;History is about to begin again.&rdquo; In some of the largest cities in the country, the system is beyond salvation. This offers new opportunities for changing the debate and starting a new movement that might just save the white race &mdash; and keep the streetlights on. Detroit is hopeless &mdash; and that should give us hope.</p>

<p>One thing that Whites MUST remember is that the blacks and other minorities didn&rsquo;t come here on their own or invade our country, and they didn&rsquo;t migrate into the major cities on their own. STUPID Whites brought them here and let the proliferate.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-98122" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Germany and the Netherlands have finally taken over Europe.</p>
<p>Germans are the most intelligent of the Europeans, with a faster mind than Nordics due to Roman admixture.</p>
<p>As they have before, Germans will get pissed at what has befallen Europe. Their sloppy next-door neighbor has let in multitudes of Bantus and Islamic invaders. To the south, countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece have allowed themselves to be usured by companies like Goldman Sachs, and their own indolence. To the north, their Scandinavian brethren have been locked down in icy authoritarian &#8220;Tolerant&#8221; regimes, tolerant to rape by foreign tribes and settlement by them as well.</p>
<p>To the East, this time things are different. The Germans who support native Europeans will have allies in Russia under Putin, Poland under the Catholic guidance, Slovakin nationalists, the powerful Hungarian nationalist party, and hordes of Asians ready to compeyitively maraud Europe anytime.</p>
<p>No unstrategic, vain occultist shall overcome Germany this time. Instead, Germany shall be succesfullu ally itsself with the traditionalist, nationalist East. The cure shall come from the East this time.</p>
<p>A Slavic-German-Catholic-Eastern Orthodox wave shall form to drive thr invaders from Western Europe. Why shoukd they tolerate that mess in their backyard?</p>
<p>A Europe finally under open German-Dutch hegemony reform the Mediteranids to function again. The Mediteranids will provide thr passionate spark, once functional, to resurrect Europe.<br/>
Rampant racism shall break out across Italy, a new Enlightenment spreading to the North out of the Po river valley.</p>
<p>Out with the foreign tribes!<br/>
Why would a nation allow foreign tribes to settle on its land, and take their women? Allow for true human diversity, in their own lands!</p>
<p>The European Rennaissance will precede the American. Unfortunately, American will slip into morass of balkanization and renormalization of chaos. It will be up to individuals to navigate the less friendly, more ethnically torn America. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-98424" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Germany has allowed less immigrants than France and England. The immigrants they have allowed in have been the comparitively less harmful Turks, and in smaller proportional numbers than France/England.</p>
<p>Most importantly, German citizenship is based on being ethnically German. It is called &#8220;blood-citizenship&#8221;. No foreign ethnicity, save a few ethnic European enclaves of Slavs, and Jewz descended from German Jews, can ever become a citizen.</p>
<p>The reason for this blood citizenship system was to enable the acceptance of the 10 million expelled Germans from Eastern Europe following WWII. Also, following the fall of Communism, 2 million Germans from Kazakhstan, Russia and Transylvania have become Germans.<br/>
Point it, Germans have it clear that Nationhood should be based on blood and cultural ties. In France, Bantus and Arabs can become &#8220;Frenchmen&#8221;. In England, Pakistanis and Zimbabwens can become &#8220;British&#8221;. This is something Germans, with their history of ethnic conflict, woukd never have agreed to.</p>
<p>Because of the blood citizenship law, Germany can easily, at any time, begin to repatriate foreigners. France and England, with their vaporous ideas of citizenship, will have a much harder time.</p>
<p>Thus Germany will lead the way in reducing immigrant population, who most Germans, with their basic common sense, see as &#8220;guests&#8221;.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-98046" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I was born in Detroit. Henry Ford Hospital! My French ancestors settled Detroit. Many of the streets are named for them. I weep for this city. The very prosperity that made Detroit, caused its downfall. Blacks swarmed into the city to work in the car factories. This city and its environs, attracted many people from the South. There is a city here, Inkster, known by all the locals as &#8220;Mississipi Inkster&#8221;, because the vast majority of the inhabitants are blacks and their progeny hail from ole Miss. Likewise, the city known as Hazel Park, is unofficially known as Hazeltucky, an homage, if you will,  to all the denizens (White)  of Kentucky who likewise emigrated to Michigan.  Detroit was the Paris of the Midwest because it was one of the few cities in America founded by the French.  I don&rsquo;t know how many of you have ever been to Michigan, but it is one of the most beautiful states in the union. I lived in Detroit until 1999. I was the only White in my neighborhood. I volunteered for EVERYTHING!!!!! I did neighborhood watch, literacy volunteer, and always went to the &#8220;Clean Up Detroit&#8221; weekend, which, by the way, always consisted of 99% Whites from the suburbs. After a drug gang shooting next door to my house, (I wasn&rsquo;t happy when the owner of the next door house, a Wayne County Deputy, told me me she was moving to Southfield, and would be renting her house out ), I GAVE UP, I gave up on Blacks being equal, I gave up on Blacks being capable of ruling themselves, or anything. I moved out! No more income taxes from me. I did sell my house, but I don&rsquo;t know if the purchaser ever paid property taxes. I moved to the suburbs, as many Whites before me did. I sadly, did not move far enough north. (How far do I want to drive to my job?). My heretofore pristinely White suburb is now inexorably turning black. You can always tell, they like to park their Jags and Mercedes in the driveway. Apparently, parking your car in the garage is verboten. Or, at least, preventing from showboating to your new neighbors how &#8220;rich&#8221; you are, while neglecting to cut your f@#$ing!!!! lawn.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-98171" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, Blacks are mostly responsible for the degradation of Detroit. However, and this is an important fact for people on this site to understad, there are none too few White-trash types as well. You mention, &#8220;Hazeltucky&#8221;, an enclave of poor white trash. I have seen areas like this and have seen those that inhabit those areas. They are utter trash. As bad as any Black I have seen. </p>
<p>So, as we point out deficiencies in non-White races, let us remember there are a fair number of Whites that should be put in the same labor camp. Its about values nearly as much as culture and race.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-98349" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It is a little known fact that Detroit spends MORE per student than neighboring Grosse Pointe MI which is one of the richest suburbs in America.  </p>
<p>These figures are on greatschools.com.  </p>
<p>Last I checked, Detroit was spending about $12,000 per kid and Grosse Pointe was at about $11,500.  Yet Detroit has some of the WORST test scores in the country and Grosse Pointe has some of the best. <br/>
Also, poor white kids in Kentucky do FAR better on the SAT than their black counter-parts in Detroit who&rsquo;s parents actually make more money.  </p>
<p>What is problem?  Detroit Public Schools is 99% black and Grosse Pointe Schools are about 90% white&hellip;.but that is rapidly changing.  Blacks are buying homes in Grosse Pointe with 3% down with a menu of federal programs to help them move to the burbs.  Grosse Pointe Schools has seen a recent decline in the test scores.</p>
<p>Many Detroit suburban school districts are turning black as African Americans flee the city now that nothing much is left.  This is happening in Harper Woods, Southfield, Eastpointe and many other cities that boarder Detroit.  </p>
<p>It would be extremely interesting reading if someone tracked the test scores of a given Detroit suburban school district as it turned from nearly all white to nearly all black.  Watch the scores drop as the number of black students increases.  Same school, same teachers, same books, different kids and the scores drop.  </p>

<p>Maybe the most scary thing about a Romney victory won&rsquo;t be the riots, robberies, rapes, and murders, but it will be the GOP&rsquo;s agreement that &#8220;America is still a deeply racist nation&#8221; and the &#8220;national discussion on race&#8221; that calls on the White community to &#8220;finally undo&#8221; its racist unearned White privilege.</p>

<p>One thing that Whites MUST remember is that the blacks and other minorities didn&rsquo;t come here on their own or invade our country, and they didn&rsquo;t migrate into the major cities on their own. STUPID Whites brought them here and let the proliferate.</i></p>
<p>Blacks <i>did</i> enslave and sell them, though.  If we MUST remember stuff, let&rsquo;s include that, eh?  It&rsquo;s also important to remember that the Whites who brought them here and the Whites who turned them loose were on either side of America&rsquo;s most devastating war.  It&rsquo;s also important to remember that even &#8220;the Whites who brought them here&#8221; isn&rsquo;t as simple as it sounds; Yankees controlled shipping, after all, which is how blacks got here.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious that the Whites who turned blacks loose on America - the Yankees - are the ones to blame.  Southerners fought the bloodiest war in American history to prevent the calamity that Yankee fanaticism and ignorance ultimately turned loose on America.</p>
