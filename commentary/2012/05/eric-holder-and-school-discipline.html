<h1 class="title">Eric Holder and School Discipline</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Joseph Kay, American Renaissance, May 1, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
A reply to Jared Taylor.</div> 
</div> 


<p>At first glance, Eric Holder&rsquo;s efforts to create strict proportionality in school discipline make no sense (see Jared Taylor&rsquo;s <a href="../../../features/2012/04/school-suspensions-more-official-baloney.html">feature article</a>.) Just ask any teacher, including most black ones, about how the average black behaves compared to the average white or Asian. Differences are an indisputable reality, and I strongly suspect that for all but the most strident ideologues, they are a self-evident reality. So something deeper, less obvious must be the motivation for this policy of proportionate school discipline (this, of course, assumes that the DOJ is capable of devious machinations.) Four probably overlapping possibilities come to mind:</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Devious economic motivation</span>. White and Asian students would suffer if punishments were doled out by quota, and this would darken the school. The upshot would be more jobs for blacks, since few whites will work in a largely black school. Racial &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; is just a ruse to get jobs.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Psychological motivation</span>. Blacks always want to feel good, and are thus happy to suppress data showing them to be miscreants. This is true even if the data would objectively help them, so in a contest between genuine improvement and self esteem, the latter triumphs.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screw whitey</span>. Secretary Holder and company know that whites would suffer under a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; discipline policy, and that&rsquo;s the point: Punish whitey even if the school collapses in chaos. This is a little like what now happens in the Middle East: I don&rsquo;t mind suffering, so long as my enemy suffers twice as much.</p>
<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exasperation</span>. Every effort to close the academic gaps between whites and blacks has failed, no matter how costly or difficult to administer, and there is no promising solution on the legislative agenda. Yet, many black ideologues genuinely believe there is <em>something </em>that will succeed, so out of desperation they are willing to try the most hare-brained scheme. Who knows what will come next when this &ldquo;fair punishment&rdquo; nostrum fails?</p>
<p>All of this just confirms that the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; project is taking on the characteristics of a religion, and this applies equally to blacks and many, but not all, whites. Propositions that should be scientifically verified are now articles of faith, and those who even suggest the need for empirical verification are heretics. This religious devotion is reinforced by all the jobs that flow from keeping the faith.</p>
<p>Head Start is the perfect example. It makes no difference that all the evidence suggests it has not accomplished its mission of improving cognitive skills. It must be continued because it is part of civil rights dogma: The government is obligated lift up blacks and to give them jobs. Salvation does not come from tinkering with one policy or adjusting another but from keeping the faith.</p>
<p>Thus, year by year, the black version of reality further separates from the white version. Whites stress different policies &mdash; for example, using school vouchers or starting charter schools &mdash; while blacks harden their views, many of which have nothing to do with empirical evidence.  Put another way, all the data-driven arguments that whites offer to blacks about uplift efforts fall on deaf ears. It&rsquo;s like trying to convince the true believer that there is no God.</p>

He had RIOT POLICE turn up at his house at 07:30 who smashed down his front door and arrested him for &#8220;election fraud&#8221;.  He was held for 7 hours - and released without charge (formerly known as we have no evidence).<br/>
This has been coordinated with the media spewing out their propaganda and lies to make Mike Whitby look like a fraudster THREE DAYS BEFORE POLLING DAY.<br/>
My friends - the United Kingdom is a fascist, three-in-one party state where even the slightest disagreement with the ruling elite will lead to persecution, humiliation, arrest and even death (Dr David Kelly for example).  <br/>

<p>The only thing I was waiting for was the thing to be done.  It was nothing more than a two-hour infomercial for charter schools, and blaming teachers unions for all the world&rsquo;s problems.  Now I&rsquo;m hardly a fan of NEA/AFT political agendas, but they&rsquo;re not as bad as that.</p>
<p>Personally, I think some people really stand to benefit if the power of teachers unions is diminished.  Whoever they are, I think they funded this propaganda documentary.</p>

as one who went through elementary school in the 1950&#8242;s and ended up teaching in elementary schools in the 1990&#8242;s and 2000&#8242;s-  I can tell you the difference&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..though it isn&rsquo;t always simple&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. the culture has changed so much.  in the 50&#8242;s the teachers expected you to sit down and shut up&hellip;&hellip; you would be directed when to talk.  You were expected to pay attention and know what was going on.   If you were somehow deficient and not able to cope in the classroom, you would be gone.   If you were quiet and barely hung in there, you would stay.  The school and the classroom were not about you, they were about presenting the subject matter to you and you would learn it the best you could.  fast forward to the 2000&#8242;s;<br/>
lots of time spent in getting to the classroom, breakfast in the cafeteria first, many would sit and play with the bowl of cereal for 15+ minutes&hellip;&hellip; then, finally in the classroom, you would waste 10+ minutes deciding what each little darling would order for lunch.  Then possibly a show and tell half hour-recess - bathroom break for the whole class&hellip;&hellip;.. then art class&hellip;&hellip;.  afterwhich the teacher might read a story&hellip;&hellip;.. do a worksheet or two with noisy neighbors and much personal distraughtness over who-knows-what-  then recess again  &mdash;    &mdash;    etc etc&hellip;&hellip;.children called out of the classroom for any myriad of reasons&hellip;&hellip;.. personal problems  &mdash;    &mdash;  -on and on&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br/>
and that&rsquo;s in a &#8216;good&rsquo; school. <br/>
anyone who is doing private school or homeschooling is ahead of the terrible game called public schools&hellip;&hellip;..I didn&rsquo;t even address the diversity/homosexual/political programming that goes on.</p>

<p>If you reduce the benefits of Whiteness in society, you levelize Whites down to equality with the beloved community of color, and you get paid by the govt. to do it to them, including lifetime pension and healthcare.  Lifetime benefits even in collapse? Yes, bc the govt. can always print the money to pay for the benefits of its workers and retirees.  A govt. pension will be the final accumulation of wealth in America.  Except for the White veterans.  They&rsquo;ll be screwed somehow.&#8221;As bad as lynching was, Diversity is worse.&#8221;  -Rev.

 <br/>
I remember reading about a woman who claims all science needs to be revisited because it is male-centric and therefore invalid.  Not enough &#8220;wise Latinas&#8221; and such among the ranks of the Nobel laureates, you see.  So there&rsquo;s just no way science as we know it can be clear and objective.<br/>
 <br/>
Real free-market capitalism has been strangled to death by a century of egalitarian nonsense.  &#8220;Republican&#8221; has become a bad word whether it has a capital R or lower r because of decades of decidedly non-(R)republicans inaccurately applying the label to themselves, and democracy is and always has been a farce as long as the vote is granted to people who expose themselves to old women at bus stops and sleep under newspapers.  Science is next, just wait and see.  We&rsquo;re not far from it being simply racist when it proves incapable of providing a smokescreen for black failure to reliable hide behind.  </p>

<p>1.       Evolution was divinely stopped 30,000 years ago.<br/>
2.       Electricity can be stored in make-believe batteries, large enough to support the power grid when the wind stops, or the sun goes down.<br/>
3.       Education can change IQ.</p>
<p>Like the Catholic Church of the 1500s, the faithful are compensated by the taxation powers of the State, and Heretics are silenced by the control of the State.</p>
<p>Humanity is to be punished for the misbehavior of non-Believers, and will die in a fire if the State dictates are not adhered to.<br/>
 <br/>
And there is a new religious symbol: <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/multimedia/image/b1obama_logo/" rel="nofollow">the windmill</a>, which has replaced the cross. One distinct mark of progress is that you can Logically affix three people to a windmill, whereas only one could be affixed to a cross.</p>

<p>The liberal ideologues Petronius describes are in reality adherents to a strict faith that tolerates no blasphemy against the twin gods of egalitarianism and multiculturalism and strikes down all apostates swiftly and devastatingly.  It roots out all signs of the previous faiths held by the populace, in the same fashion that resulted in the near eradication of Christianity from the Muslim lands under the sword of Muhammad and his followers.</p>
<p>Liberalism is a religion, first and last.  It is not logic or reason.  It is faith and belief.  It holds up prophets and legends and calls them intellectuals and science.  It requires its followers to give their souls over entirely to the faith, without exception.  They can have no other loyalties outside the creed of liberalism.  Consider the mental gymnastics engaged in by the handful of liberals who post here, sympathetic to our cause or not, in efforts to square their faith with the circle of logic and reason.    </p>

<p>The reason there are more RINOs than real conservatives is simply because the &#8220;real conservatives&#8221; buckle under pressure and become PC when it comes to racial issues. This has been shown to be the case time and time again. This isn&rsquo;t a name or label issue, it&rsquo;s a character flaw that is no more prevalent on the Left than it is on the Right.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s views on social and economical issues would have me leaning a little toward the liberal side&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m probably more driven by actual reason and rationale than any conservative I know. I&rsquo;m certainly more &#8220;race-ist&#8221; than the conservatives I know. In fact, the people who accept my views the most are the Libertarians; to a lesser degree, the Liberals; to an even lesser degree, the Conservatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberalism is a religion, first and last.  It is not logic or reason. <br/>
It is faith and belief.  It holds up prophets and legends and calls<br/>
them intellectuals and science.  It requires its followers to give their<br/>
souls over entirely to the faith, without exception.  They can have no<br/>
other loyalties outside the creed of liberalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>This quote can be used to describe the tenets of conservatism just as easily.</p>
<p>You say the conservatives of today are charlatans and not real conservatives. I say the liberals of today are charlatans and not real liberals. Who&rsquo;s right?</p>

<p>Here is an excellent speech given by Ron Paul where he clearly lays out the problem as far as he can without risking a bullet to his temple AS PAST LEADERS HAVE TAKEN FOR DARING TO POINT OUT WHAT HE IS SAYING HERE.  This is no joke.  Our government is occupied, both parties are controlled and part of that control is the very real threat of assassination&hellip;.which has been done before.  Ron Paul, btw is a VERY brave man.  To my knowledge he is the ONLY major politician to talk of these things.  And he knows the consequences.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is a crackpot.  He wants to legalize prostitution, pornography, polygamy, heroin, crack, and all other forms of civil society-shredding social chaos.   He agrees with the most extreme anti-American anti-Western leftists and Islamists on foreign policy and national security.   Forget him.</p>

BREAKING NEWS&hellip;BREAKING NEWS&hellip;BREAKING NEWS&hellip;<br/>
Please will you cover this story.<br/>
POLITICAL PERSECUTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOMI think most people in the US recognise Britain as a rotten, Marxist, totalitarian, Stalinist nanny-state.  You are totally correct.  However YOU WILL BE SHOCKED at the brutal political persecution of the British National Party Mayoral candidate, Mike Whitby for the city of Liverpool.<br/>
He had RIOT POLICE turn up at his house at 07:30 who smashed down his front door and arrested him for &#8220;election fraud&#8221;.  He was held for 7 hours - and released without charge (formerly known as we have no evidence).<br/>
This has been coordinated with the media spewing out their propaganda and lies to make Mike Whitby look like a fraudster THREE DAYS BEFORE POLLING DAY.<br/>
My friends - the United Kingdom is a fascist, three-in-one party state where even the slightest disagreement with the ruling elite will lead to persecution, humiliation, arrest and even death (Dr David Kelly for example).  <br/>
Watch IN HORROR!!!!!!!!<br/>
I have tried to link to the youtube video but it has not worked.  Please go to the BNP website at:  www.bnp.org.uk and watch the video on political persecution of BNP candidate.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-205207" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As a school teacher I notice daily that Black kids are treated with kid gloves wherever I work. The staff are afraid to discipline them and will often blame the White or Asian kid for the Black kid&rsquo;s wrongdoing. The bad behavior sometimes gets rewarded. Allowing Blacks to misbehave has caused corruption everywhere. The Black parents try to intimidate the school administration and teachers who are afraid of becoming a hate crime victim. Who will stand up for the teacher if she is gang raped and beaten without an alibi or witness? I have seen this hideous existence for the past few years in schools that have Blacks. It can have a student body of even 10% lack to ruin the environment. These Blacks are poison to any school and parents should strongly consider home-schooling their children if they want to ensure the safety of their kids. In a school district that consistently ranks in the lower 10% year after year they can only hire desperate people who would normally be unqualified to work in a mid-range or upper-range performing district. This is why these schools will only get worse and eventually deteriorate. Blacks are pestilent dregs nd will continue to wreak havoc and dread wherever they roam. Naturally, they may come and go and there are ebb and flows to their existence. But as long as Federally Funded housing, Welfare entitlements, racial quotas and forced integration persist, we will see further decay and destruction to our country. The reprobates will take over and devour everything in their wake.</p>
