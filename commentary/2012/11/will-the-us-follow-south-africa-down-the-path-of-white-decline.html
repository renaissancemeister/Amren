<h1 class="title">Will the US Follow South Africa Down the Path of White Decline?</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Dan Roodt, American Renaissance, November 9, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
The fate of the West may be at stake.</div> 
</div> 


<p>In the aftermath of President Obama&rsquo;s victory, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> described the GOP as the &#8220;WOP,&#8221; the White Old Party. Indeed, the Republican Party finds itself in a demographic death spiral as youth, single women, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians overwhelmingly vote Democrat.</p>
<p>In fact, the Democratic Party could become the American version of South Africa&rsquo;s African National Congress (ANC), as immigration and high non-white birth rates ensure a steady stream of Democratic voters eager for &#8220;change&#8221; or even South African-style &ldquo;transformation:&rdquo; the ANC&rsquo;s term for racial revolution and ever tighter anti-white measures.</p>
<p>The latest proposal is for all charities, such as orphanages or soup kitchens, to lose their non-profit status if they serve any whites at all. It would mean that charitable organizations could serve only blacks, and that whites would not be allowed to help each other in any organized way, even to alleviate poverty or care for orphaned children.</p>
<div id="attachment_101991" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Poor_Whites.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-101991 " title="To match feature SAFRICA-WHITES/" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Poor_Whites.jpg" width="600" height="400"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">White children playing at a South African shantytown.</p></div>
<p>In the United States, such extreme anti-white measures are probably unthinkable today, but as recently as the early 1980s the idea of a black president in South Africa was deemed equally unthinkable. Even Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s spokesman Bernard Ingham said at the time: &ldquo;Anyone who thinks the ANC will form the government of South Africa is living in cloud cuckoo-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the 1960s, so-called apartheid South Africa was still considered such a desirable place to live that 500,000 Britons emigrated there, fleeing socialist Britain.</p>
<p>The question therefore arises: how could South Africa, once seen as a leading Western power more or less on par with Canada or Australia, collapse so quickly to become &ldquo;just another African country?&rdquo; And what lessons can white Americans draw from our tragic demise, as they ponder the outcome of a Presidential election in which the evidence of a demographic turn for the worse is clear for all to see?</p>
<p>Ilana Mercer&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=into+the+canibals+pot"><em>Into the Cannibal&rsquo;s Pot: Lessons for America from Post-Apartheid South Africa</em> </a>went some way towards portraying the horrors and mayhem whites face under a hostile black government, but the underlying causes of South Africa&rsquo;s spectacular collapse still need explanation.</p>
<p>A century ago, South African whites still enjoyed demographic parity with blacks and were a majority in most towns and cities. In 1950, demographers sympathetic to the National Party shocked everyone at a Stellenbosch University conference by stating that the black population could grow from 8 million to 20 million by 2000. This prediction seemed so outlandish no one believed it. The recent census confirmed that blacks now represent 40 million, far overshooting the &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; of 1950.</p>
<p>South African whites feared communism more than anything else, but American racial ideologies such as affirmative action and so-called BEE (&ldquo;black economic empowerment &mdash; our version of minority procurement) are doing vastly more damage to them. At least under communism the Bolshoi ballet still functioned and the Soviet Union still had a space program. The pursuit of diversity and multiculturalism in South Africa has, however, led to across-the-board decline; some small towns regularly suffer water and electricity shortages.</p>
<p>In my opinion,America&rsquo;s future will not resemble its past, but will look more like today&rsquo;sSouth Africa. As the number of whites declines, loss of power will follow, leading to aggressive legislation pushing whites out of jobs and most positions of power.</p>
<div id="attachment_101992" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Poor-Whites.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-101992" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Poor-Whites.jpg" width="600" height="400"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One-room shack at squatter camp for whites in South Africa.</p></div>
<p>Many whites will emigrate or move to the remaining red states, just as South Africa&rsquo;s whites have emigrated since 1994. But ultimately there will be no place to go, as the global demographic decline of whites means that even European countries suffer the same fate of dispossession.</p>
<p>Demography is destiny, as Auguste Comte said. There is a mysterious process whereby whites react to racial domination not by rioting or claiming special privileges as other races do, but by working harder, having even fewer children, and quarrelling among themselves. We see this happening in South Africa, in Western Europe and, of course, in America, where white Republicans and Democrats are like two dogs fighting over a bone, while a third is about to run away with it and leave them with nothing.</p>
<p>The Republican Party is poised to adopt the attitude of South Africa&rsquo;s liberal opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which has forsaken its core white support and practices affirmative action in its own ranks. There are three women on its election posters: one white, one colored or mixed-race, and one black, at once expressing the party&rsquo;s diversity and its disdain for the white male.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor <a href="/news/2012/11/the-2012-election-what-it-means-for-whites.html">asks that the Republican Party</a> be loyal to its electorate and become the unabashed champion of white interests. Again, the history ofSouth Africa is instructive. British Prime Minister Harold McMillan made a famous speech in the South African parliament  on February 3, 1960, in which he warned us that &ldquo;the wind of change is blowing through the African continent&rdquo; and that ultimately we would have to surrender power to the nonwhite majority. Our brilliant leader, Hendrik Verwoerd, promptly replied in an unprepared speech that &ldquo;the tendency in Africa for nations to become independent, and at the same time to do justice to all, does not only mean being just to the black man of Africa, but also being just to the white man of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_101993" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Statue-of-Verwoerd.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-101993" title="Statue of Verwoerd" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Statue-of-Verwoerd.jpg" width="614" height="408"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Statue of Verwoerd that was moved from downtown Pretoria to Orania.</p></div>
<p>Verwoerd&rsquo;s slogan of &ldquo;justice for the white man too&rdquo; was rejected by most of the Western world. Lest we forget, the rank and file of the Republican Party rebelled against Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s veto and passed sanctions againstSouth Africa on Sept. 29, 1986.</p>
<p>Since that time, the U.S. has consistently pursued an anti-white foreign policy. In Southern Africa it supported black Marxist movements such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West African Peoples Organization (SWAPO). In Europe, it has called for a large Muslim state &mdash; Turkey &mdash; to be included in the European Union. Would the American elite ever adopt a pro-white policy domestically while pursuing the opposite of such a policy externally?</p>
<p>There are three forces that are likely to determine the Republican Party&rsquo;s position on white interests. The first is the wishes of its own electorate; the second is the corporate sector that funds the party, and the third is the mainstream media. America&rsquo;s large corporations support affirmative action and diversity, while the media support multiculturalism. The GOP will follow their bidding and betray its voters.</p>
<p>Like the whites of the former Rhodesia, South West Africa, and South Africa, Republicans will embark on a forlorn search for conservative allies &ldquo;of color&rdquo; whom non-white voters will reject as traitors. Even if a black woman such as Condoleezza Rice could be fielded as the next Republican presidential candidate, it is doubtful whether many blacks or Hispanics would vote for her.</p>
<p>Patrick Buchanan and others have already chronicled &ldquo;the death of the West,&rdquo; but we need to understand the laws of this process, because it follows a pattern of false hopes, interspersed with successive betrayals by white leaders. The final days of the Roman Empire followed the same fatal chain of events.</p>
<p>The crisis is far deeper than most Americans realize. South Africa went from being a powerful, Western country to capitulation in just ten years: from 1980 to 1990. President Barack Obama has already started to fire some of his best generals, just like F.W. de Klerk purged his army of all pro-white generals prior to surrendering to the ANC.</p>
<p>I fear that white Americans take false comfort in &ldquo;still being the majority.&rdquo; They do not realize how quickly they will lose that status as global demographics change, and immigration to the US accelerates.South Africa is now being overrun by immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. But America too will become a haven for African immigrants as the population of our continent doubles from the current one billion to two billion within the next 30 or 40 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_101994" style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Here-they-Come.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-101994" title="Here They Come" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Here-they-Come.jpg" width="360" height="348"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">African refugees.</p></div>
<p>It could even be that Africa&rsquo;s burgeoning population poses a far greater demographic risk to Americans than Mexicans. Unprecedented technological change, especially in communications, has put immigration information at the disposal of Africans in even the remotest villages.</p>
<p>American whites could become a minority much sooner than they think. That has been our experience in South Africa; people appreciate the enormity of change only after it is too late.</p>
<p>Some white Americans may clamor for self-determination, and the South may want to secede again. However, any breakaway group will find itself in the political wilderness, without media support and fighting the forces of demography and history.</p>
<p>We need to form a global network to keep America from falling into the hands of anti-white zealots. We should constantly compare notes on successes and failures, taking heart from every success. The United States is such a military and economic power that the battle now taking shape within its borders could well determine the fate of the West. If the United States goes the way of South Africa, whites everywhere will be in danger.</p>

For an answer look at all the heartbreak and tragic results where white couples adopt 3rd world or black children. These kids get a loving environment, the best medicals, food and education etc. Yet by the time the kids are teenagers they are either pregnant or in prison or just want to go and slum it out with their own ethnic group.</p>
<p>In a particularly nasty and quite recent case here in Oz an adopted child( from the 3rd world and now grown up) murdered his white parents in an attempt to get their estate. Basically this is what every brutal murder in South Africa or Detroit is all about, that is to get and or destroy everything the white man has created.</p>

out the `why` rather  than the `how to do it `will probably<br/>
lead to more tragic deaths as what happened to this poor<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-146996" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>According to the London Telegraph: <br/>
&#8220;Yet the most right-wing president in recent memory has become the unlikely<br/>
darling of anti-poverty activists for his unsung efforts to help Africa&hellip;In the last year of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s presidency, America&rsquo;s direct bilateral<br/>
assistance to Africa was only Pounds 700 million. Mr Bush has almost<br/>
quadrupled this sum. Combating Aids once played virtually no part in America&rsquo;s development<br/>
policies. Mr Bush has established the biggest fund ever devoted to fighting<br/>
an epidemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, just like with the Hispanic issue, no white man is ever going to be able to convince non-whites to help. We must concentrate on the anti-white whites. Obama has African ancestry and African relatives, so he cannot be persuaded not to use white peoples&rsquo; money to feed blacks who cannot feed themselves and will never be able to feed their increasing number of children.</p>
<p>The challenge is to either make the Bush-types understand that they are consigning middle and working class whites (and eventually themselves) to oblivion, or to somehow neutralizing the influence of the Bushes who seek to harm the whites below them in order to enhance their status. Not voting for the Neocons isn&rsquo;t going to help. They won&rsquo;t attribute their losses to the rage of the whites who they betrayed. Violence obviously can&rsquo;t be endorsed. So what does that leave?</p>

you&rsquo;re making the left look smart. White, Black, Asian, or Mixed. The broad Jeb<br/>
Bush married is White. Whites from Southern Europe have different<br/>
look/bone/skin tone than the former White Northern European majority of the<br/>
USA. For example Cameron Diaz is white, Alex Rodriguez is mixed, and Pedro Martinez<br/>
(the former Boston Red Sox pitcher) is black. It&rsquo;s not hard to tell what a<br/>
person is. Obama is mixed, so people that call him Black make no sense. There<br/>
will NEVER be a full dark skinned Black guy as president, EVER. White guilt<br/>
will die out (because left-wing whites don&rsquo;t breed lol). Utah, Idaho, The<br/>
Dakotas, Wyoming, Northern Arizona, are areas where Whites breed, and in Arizona&rsquo;s<br/>
case, they KNOW they must be Pro-White, or the mixed-raced trash, the left, and<br/>
the socialist army from south of the border will take over. The Republican Party<br/>
lost many races Tuesday because MANY White males jumped to the joke that is the<br/>
libertarian party. How can any White male support prostitution, gay marriage,<br/>
drug legalization, and many left-wing nutter causes. Libertarian party cost the<br/>
Republican Party the election, and control of the senate. Whites are divided<br/>
and will stay that way, until we make up less than 60% of the USA. Asians are<br/>
very conservative people; the Republican Party must start a push to appeal to<br/>
them. Blacks are brain dead and will solely vote for the Democrat party no<br/>
matter what. Mixed-raced people will always vote Democrat because they will promise<br/>
them handouts. White women that demand free abortion/birth control will die<br/>
out. So the Republican Party doesn&rsquo;t have to change the push for normal/traditional<br/>
family values, it just needs to get some Asians on the band wagon (Asians are socially<br/>
and fiscally conservative). We also don&rsquo;t need some idiot (Mitt Romney) running for president, while calling Vladimir<br/>
Putin the #1 enemy of the USA.</p>

<p>Some White males, myself included, see those causes as benefiting the white race. Prohibitions on things like drugs and prostitution really only serve to protect the stupid and immoral from themselves. After decades of doing that, we are now being overrun by stupid and immoral.</p>
<p>When my grandfather was a teenager, a century ago, he could buy heroin at any corner apothecary shop. He never did though. In fact most whites didn&rsquo;t. Drug prohibition was actually directed at non-whites. If you read the early 20th century drug propaganda, you can see that for yourself.</p>

<p>The reason for the requirement that both parents be citizens is so the President would not have divided loyalties. With Obama it is easy to see why the founders thought that way.</p>

Then in 1994 they handed a country in perfect working order over to the black communist terrorist ANC regime, whereby supposed agreements regarding minority groups&rsquo; rights were made between the then ruling white party and Nelson Mandela. A few years afterwards, the ANC turned their back on these agreements, and started turning into the new black racist apartheid government. Minority groups (eg white, coloured, Indian) are now marginalised and vitims of nazi-style social engineering of the ANC. BUT WHO CARES? Nobody, because the whole world has been brainwashed to believe the lies about SA and that the whites deserve.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-316974" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It leaves what it has always left and what the Founding Fathers of the Revolutionary Period left us as perhaps their greatest mistaken trust: namely a refusal to legislate within the Constitution a mandate for revolutionary recourse as &#8220;When this happens, take up arms, declare a national emergency and hold a Constitutional Convention. Don&rsquo;t wait for it to get worse. Don&rsquo;t ask for permission, simply do as your instincts say must be done.&#8221; as a strict conditionalist doctrine.<br/>
The Declaration Of Independence specifically states violent revolution as a duty as much as right when our rulers do not give us redress for our complaints. But the DOI is not law so much as dream and in a soft society, people don&rsquo;t seek dream or duty, they seek -ease-.<br/>
And those who might do something about this looming disaster are lost in the squeeze chart between centrists and extremists, finding no guidance as moral comfort in a mandate to action.<br/>
Of course, in the late 18th century, we were viewing the world through a lens or perspective which feared the breakup or crib kill of a young rebel nation state into less racial than national and class-as-means driven component groups, easy to pick off.<br/>
&#8220;As we fail to hang together, so shall we certainly hang apart.&#8221;<br/>
A condition of destructive fragmentation which did indeed arise, a 90 years later, as the South sought to protect it&rsquo;s regional interests as lack of industrial capacity through perpetuation of the slave economy.<br/>
Unfortunately, the truth is that this nation can only be saved by envy. As those whites who remember what their genetic algorithms tell them beyond what social engineering does, can _see_ what success looks and feels like as a deep satiation of instinct. A reawakening of the dream as longing for&hellip;Freedom.<br/>
In this, it is absolutely critical to understand that we do not face any one group within our borders who will acknowledge the penalties of losing our country but rather the forces of Global Socialism at work, acting from outside it.<br/>
Forces which seek to annihilate &#8216;nationalism&rsquo; as a whole and thus suffers no guilt at the destruction of racial homelands such as the United States once represented.<br/>
To fight this attempt at &#8216;irreversible destinty&rsquo;, you must decide, once and forever, that it is a _very bad idea_ for us to move towards what the sociologists label as a &#8216;Type 1 Civilization&rsquo;. Where global rule over all peoples exceeds that of the genetic as evolutionary outcomes of any given geneline.<br/>
This is where we fail to make our case. Because as true diversity thinking doesn&rsquo;t seek global domination of other cultures, nor can it abandon the best interests of the people who espouse it.<br/>
And this is where the agenda that says &#8220;The annihilation of a single people to serve a greater good&#8221; cannot in fact -be- about good.<br/>
But only about power. And the occulted quest for power as it&rsquo;s own agenda is always centered upon evil. Even when it is by nominal do-gooder liberals.</p>

What is astounding is that we have the model - the Roman Empire of the West - for our fall, but our so-called leadership is either willfully ignorant or indifferent to the consequences of the liberal policies which have impelled this decline.  Over and over again, our leaders, many of whom are or were Republican, put machinery and polices in place which have had the effect of destroying the ethos WHICH IS NECESSARY to maintaining the greatest civilization(s) and nation the world has ever seen. </p>

I don&rsquo;t know if its just my imagination but it seems to me that they are trying to replace schools that have always had predominantly white Quarterbacks with black ones, examples Ohio state, Notre Dame, Michigan.

North America was inhabited largely by stone-age warring tribal cultures who killed and made slaves of each other and exploited whatever resources they could as they saw fit so this &#8220;noble savage&#8221; picture doesn&rsquo;t play well here. Anglo/Europeans came and built the most prosperous, industrious society and just government in history which now degenerates with the unchecked influx of these hybrid parasites from this hemisphere and others from the east. Neither they, nor their ancestors built what they now enjoy, advantage with none of the innovation or labor. We are supposed to accept now, imposed on the people who did build this nation, what you to believe to have been unjust 500 years ago when there was nothing here.</p>
<p>As far as a lesson in &#8220;going round&#8221; look to South Africa now compared to even 1970 and try to massage the facts to show how it has improved since rule has returned to the &#8220;noble savages&#8221; in that nation. After the British relinquished control of &#8220;Rhodesia&#8221; to the black gov&rsquo;t of &#8220;Zimbabwe&#8221; it quickly became a vacation paradise didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>If those are the types of places you enjoy you can probably still emigrate there, particularly if you enjoy the thrill of frequent and sundry assaults by people you will be laboring to support. I do not want these types of people from Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, Mexico, Turkey, Arabia, Sudan, S.A. &c. immigrating here and bringing this disorder with them.</p>

 <br/>
I will list the reasons I believe this.<br/>
 <br/>
1.  Detroit<br/>
2.  Flint MI, same as Detroit<br/>
3.  Pontiac MI, same as Flint.<br/>
4.  Saginaw MI, same as Pontiac.<br/>
5.  Cleveland<br/>
6.  East St. Louis</p>
<p>I could go on for several more minutes listing ruined cities but at the risk of belaboring the point I will stop at six.   Why should I believe anything is going to change????</p>
<p>The reasons whites allowed blacks to ruin these cities is because it was always easier to just move.  Why stay and fight for your neighborhood when you can just move?  So, whites fled, blacks took over and turned these places into third world villages dependent on government programs and the generosity of goofy whites trying to save blacks from themselves.<br/>
 <br/>
By the time whites wake up enough to fight back with drastic change to immigration and welfare breeding farms for low IQ thrid worlders, it will be too late. </p>
<p>I feel like I am watching one of those  1970s science fiction &#8220;end of the world&#8221; movies staring Charleton Heston!</p>

The Apartheid plan was to save the white South Africans and to ensure that that part of Africa would develope well to avoid all the problems that have plagued Africa, the whites who built up SA so that it formed 45% of the GDP of the WHOLE OF AFRICA despite international sanctions, the white South Africans who had every right to future freedom and security and who had  developed economic and social conditions that allowed the black population to grow to 40 million including those who came form central Africa and who did not care about Apartheid (separate development) all they wanted was full bellies and some sort of a paying job pus hope for the future that they could not obtain in their countries they fled that were ruled by black Africans.</p>
<p>This is not racist but factual and easy to check in the real sources.</p>
<p> Zimbabwe/Rhodesia  and most of the other African countries &#8220;given their freedom&#8221; were existing examples of a future South Africa ruled by black Africans and yet the Western Liberals and Socialists demanded that the white South Africans commit suicide.     I lived there until 1999 when having British passports my family and I escaped to Spain where we are retired, bitter but much wiser.   Many educated black South Africans did not want the changes as they knew what the future holds.  </p>

<p>Abortion has ceased to be a cause for me.  I can tell someone considering it that it is wrong and that she will probably regret it somewhere down the line, but in the end, the decision is between her and God.  My conscience is clear.  My five kids and 8 grandkids are all white and doing great.  Actually thinking of having another . . .</p>

<p>I had a look thru several pages of SA popn/demograpics, etc, but didn&rsquo;t find any racial breakdowns before the 1904 census.  I did find a 1868 estimate for the entire population as 1.06 million - interestingly this had declined by 5% or more to just over 1 million by 1870 - which seems strange.  </p>
<p>Anyway the 1.06 million is not that far from the 1.2 million you quoted and if the figure of 400,000 whites is correct then the ratio was 2 to 1, not evens.   Anyway, given that SA consisted of 4 territories at the time,  I think that any estimation of black numbers (particularly in the Boer Republics, but also Transkei and Zululand) was very much a guesstimate.   </p>
<p>Therefore, I think it could be fairly said that in those areas fully white control the black/white ratio probably was even.  </p>
<p>The most surprising thing was that in the OFS in 1904 almost 40% of the population was white.          </p>

<p>Respectfully, no, that experiment has not only been done once.  It was done in Detroit, Cleveland, East St. Louis, Flint MI, Pontiac MI, Benton Harbor MI.</p>
<p>Benton Harbor MI is a good example.  A small town on lake Michigan.  It SHOULD be one of those places like Mayberry NC on the Andy Griffith show where we city people can go to rent a cottage or go antiquing.  Instead it is a crime ridden, economic and academic disaster.  Crime rate and SAT scores nearly identical to Detroit.   Reason?  Benton Harbor MI is 95% black.  </p>
<p>This experiment has been done over and over and always has the same results.   Black folks destroy neighborhoods.  Even honest blacks will admit that.  </p>
<p>I honestly believe that blacks cannot maintain, let alone build basic shelter (homes).  Forget about skyscrapers or suspension bridges, they cannot build or maintain homes.   Of course there are a few exceptions, like white NBA players are exceptions.  </p>
<p>When you go past a construction site, it is all whites and mexicans&hellip;..VERY few blacks.   If you see more than 10% blacks on a construction site, I GUARANTEE you it is a government project. </p>

When they cannot whelp hordes of illegitmate, bastard kids on whites&rsquo; dime, they will leave. When they face violence and getting killed for harming our people, they will leave. When they cannot get jobs at the expense of whites, they will leave. In short, we don&rsquo;t have to round them up and send them south in cattle cars. We can MAKE them leave by giving them a very could shoulder and making it clear how hated and unwanted they reall are. Inducing them to self-deport as well as securing the borders are two sides of the plan. Stopping birthright citizenship, ceasing forcing hospitals to care for these illegals, AND severely restricting immigration are the only answers. I would ban all non-white immigration permanently, we can train our own doctors, scientists and engineers or recruit them from other white nations.</p>

You are absolutely correct that this race was about race, and people of color seeing everything as a racial tug-of-war.

<p>If Obama&rsquo;s manifesto had been; paint all the lamp posts in the USA yellow, he would still have won. Policy had nothing to do with the election at all.</p>
<p>Look at the South African example. The ANC has been returned to power with a 60%+ majority at each election since 1994. Yet they are effectively doing nothing for their constituency. It is all about getting on the gravy train for the power hungry and forgetting about who put them there once they get their snouts in the trough.</p>

<p>I think whites have evolved to be cooperatively tolerant to what now<br/>
is a harmful degree and are not nearly as racist as the blacks are.<br/>
Consequently, they mostly do not consider that the blacks (or Jews) are<br/>
as racially centered as they really are so just can&rsquo;t believe that the<br/>
election could actually be about race or that whites could be<br/>
the victims of racism but the last election shows this in spades (pun<br/>
intended).</p>
<p>This is why so many middle to upper-mid class people buy into these innumerable useless gov&rsquo;t programs. These suckers have reasoning ability and a work ethic and believe that the takers are similarly endowed and motivated -but they are not; they are parasites. The hosts do not understand the lifecycle of the parasite nor relate to the strategy. The takers are the uninhibited ones who will eat all of this year&rsquo;s grain and leave none to plant next year so starve without a sponsoring host of some sort -that&rsquo;s you. Others at the top of this scheme use this nearsightedness -and encourage it, to their own advantage to accrete even more wealth and power to themselves by being brokers of largess to the low classes while promising the mid/upper classes that they will benefit by raising up the &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; making them productive and as a corollary, reducing the threat of criminal activities which might be directed against the upper classes due to their undeserved &#8220;privilege&#8221;. </p>
<p>It is a scam which has really gained currency since the end of WWII when the major universities were effectively purged of all tradition and replaced by the Freudians, Straussians, and the Frankfurt-School Marxists.</p>
<p>We are effectively finished as a race. I believe that we are now past the point of return with the present demographic composition and corrupt traitorous econo-political players we have.</p>

<p>Probably about one third aren&rsquo;t mestizos at all. They&rsquo;re full blooded natives without any European ancestry. Marco Rubio is almost completely European. You&rsquo;re dreaming if you think such a pale hispanic would make the difference to them. They still would have voted for Obama.</p>
<p>The only way Romney could have won would have been to get a little bit more of the white vote. Enhancing racial divisiveness is the one true way. This is the only right way to go until the point of diminishing returns. </p>
<p>Look at it this way - Obama got 43% of the white vote last time. He got only 39% of the white vote this time. If conservatives get 4% more of the white vote next time, that&rsquo;s more than we&rsquo;ll ever get of the minority vote.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147021" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great piece, Mr. Roodt.  I think the example of South Africa (Zimbabwe, too) is a perfect case-study in White dispossession and demographic (heading into overt and active) genocide.  Your supposition that the Democratic Party will soon become America&rsquo;s ANC is spot-on as well.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the only real solution will be the creation of at least one (preferably several) inviolable White ethnostates-I&rsquo;m thinking a sort of Rocky Mountain Republic myself (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska, or thereabouts-all overwhelmingly White, traditionalist/conservative states).  The biggest obstacle, paradoxically, is convincing WHITES that this is both desirable and necessary to the very physical survival of themselves, their children, and their grandchildren (to say nothing of their culture and traditions.)</p>
<p>We need to start injecting gentle, &#8220;dog-whistle&#8221; cultural memes into American (and other nominally White) societies as seeds in the minds of Whites.  Hopefully, these seeds will grow into full-blown racial consciousness and racial &#8220;survival mode&#8221; within a decade or so.</p>
<p>How about we start with some billboard campaigns?  Or maybe start making bumper stickers, yard signs, or the like-let&rsquo;s turn it into a full-blown ad campaign.  Here are some possible slogans/messages that are not &#8220;racist&#8221; in any way-just factual and subtle, and appealing to White racial integrity:</p>
<p>1) &#8220;100% diverse means 0% White&#8221;<br/>
2) &#8220;There will be no majority-White countries in 100 years.&#8221;<br/>
3) &#8220;If endangered species are worth saving, why not Whites?&#8221;<br/>
4) &#8220;Every race in world history has owned slaves.  Whites were the only ones that freed them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have to appeal to Whites&rsquo; current sensibilities and &#8220;turn the tables&#8221; on them, so to speak.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147427" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> I think, Francis Galton, you are onto something here. Despite the demographic marginalisation of whites world-wide, the main problem is psychological and ideological. </p>
<p>I fear the Cultural Marxists active in America, especially at the universities, have cooked up the perfect storm by making sure that art and culture reflect their values. Maybe I should write a follow-up article about how whites are brainwashed by books and movies to:</p>
<p>- believe in a an alternate reality where whites are bad, criminal and lying, as opposed to &#8220;people of color&#8221; who are moral and upright citizens;<br/>
- accept that people in authority will normally be non-white (the police chief, the judge, the president). In fact, long before Obama was elected, several Hollywood movies had already featured a black president;<br/>
- accept that scientists and experts are normally black (although somewhere in the background they have white-looking slaves who actually do some of the &#8220;technical&#8221; work);<br/>
- right-wing or pro-white politics and criminality go hand in hand.</p>
<p>I have recently read a few American bestsellers by people like John Grisham and Lee Child, and watched some of the blockbuster movies and all of them contain overt and covert propaganda of this nature. Given the sustained Cultural Marxist onslaught on the minds of white Americans, I am actually surprised that so few whites actually vote for Obama!</p>
<p>Some of the theoristis of the Dutch Freedom Party have written extensively about how the American Sixties (civil rights plus the hippie movement) actually poisoned the whole of Western culture. We are currently living with the consequences of the Sixties revolution.</p>
<p>As I suggest in my article, the fate of America is absolutely crucial for Western survival. The only reason why South African blacks are not going for outright genocide against us, is because they fear some sort of international (read: American) reprisal, Nuremberg trial, etc. Once the USA is firmly in Third World hands, it will be open season on the white communities elsewhere that have already been disarmed (such as SA whites).</p>
<p>Europe too, will not stand against the Muslim world without the support of American whites. They are generally pacifists, live in overcrowded cities with little physical activity and can hardly cook their own food, let alone fight or shoot.</p>
<p>However, I would say about 20% of the Western/European population has already woken up to the problem, but they are marginalised, being treated like heretics by the multicultural media, the universities and even the churches. Together that 20% already constitutes a global force. After all, the Marxists never got 20% support among white people and look at their huge successes!</p>
<p>The internet has brought us all together, regardless of geography or even language. You can even read Russian now by using Google Translate. Like the small Greek city states stood together to stop the vastly more powerful Persian Empire more than two millennia ago, we need to work together as &#8220;islands&#8221;. </p>
<p>Like the Cultural Marxists, we need to see culture and ideology as a &#8220;terrain of struggle&#8221;. Also, we could start global campaigns and boycotts against anti-white corporations, not invest in their shares, not buy their products and generally trash their brands.</p>
<p>Always remember: one man, or a small group of dedicated people, can change the world. Just read the history of the Russian revolution. There were six people on the Politburo, and four of them were against the revolution! Lenin was in exile and only Stalin and Trotsky were in favour of overthrowing the Czar. Yet they made it happen because they wanted to.</p>
<p>Given the odds against us, we are perhaps already stronger than we realize&hellip;</p>

Let us reiterate; Obama is not a black man. His mother was white - therefore he is 50% white and 50% black. In the American context he may be considered black but the truth is he is Mulatto. In the UK this would be Mixed Race and in South Africa the term used was Coloured.<br/>
Bottom line; his ethnicity is neither black nor white and his nationality is American - and even that is suspect.</p>
<p>Something we should really be concerned about is that once Daniel Craig fulfills his contract for the next 2 Bond movies, there is talk that the the next James Bond will be black. Miss Moneypenny already makes that transition in Skyfall.</p>

I firmly agree with Mr. Roodt that some elements of Social Theory and Mass Comm studies (aka cultural Marxism) ought to be appropriated by free-thinking loyal Whites. Certainly film and television fantasies operate within a clearly defined set of racial types, overwhelming affirming White stupidity, cruelty and impotence. I&rsquo;m a grad student in the humanities, and am pleased to report that with a sound theoretical framework and abundant evidence, pro-White cultural studies is feasible. There is simply a tiny reserve of scholars interested in deconstructing anti-White discourse. They&rsquo;re quite content marrying Jews or Asians and having one mongrel offspring. </p>

If all of these social programs were run by the states, then the state wouldn&rsquo;t be able to print money. If an individual state wanted a welfare program, fine just pay for it. The states that did that would of course go broke, since they can&rsquo;t print money, like the fed. Social engineering, welfare, povery programs, etc would be in the purview of the states. We could make the arguement that it belongs to the states, and if they add them, who cares? They would most likely fail, and be proved as such by the relative prosperity of other states.</p>

The Left/right divide is so deep now that the time is right for discussing dividing the country. You can make a rational argument for two separate countries. The Left and Right are both suffering from political oppression. The Left we be free to design it&rsquo;s progressive utopia without the racism and old ideas of the right polluting the new landscape,  and the Right  can live under the existing constitution (minus a couple of offending amendments) content with their values and beliefs.<br/>
I see the division as horizontal, the division being proportional based on populations, creating two new independent countries, with the whites claiming the northern half.   Both Ideologies get two coasts,  Alaska for the north, Hawaii for the south.   The natural segregation would be for blacks, mexicans and liberal whites moving to the south, with asians deciding which side offers them the better opportunities.  You would think blacks would be wildly in favor of this plan, seeing their political power double overnight, and living in a liberal utopia where diversity is king.  Mexicans would support the plan for the same reasons, plus they would be reclaiming their ancestral homelands. White liberals would be the most excited over the new plan, with roughly equal populations, they would occupy a new land free from hate and oppression, their progressive dreams would come true, something not possible in the current USA,  &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; could be the new country&rsquo;s motto.  Other details like dividing the dept and the military, foreign holdings etc could be worked out. </p>

<p>* in the case of radical demographic shift from one group holding power to another, democracy must go. I know it&rsquo;s unpopular &amp; against the current. Just- if you want to keep your country for yourself, start the process of ethnic cleansing &amp; clearly defined racial-ethnic policies. So, democracy, equality, liberty, fraternity &hellip;..must go.</p>
<p>* in the extreme cases, it can be &#8220;solved&#8221; only through some kind of WW3 with billions- not tens of millions - casualties. When you still own superior fire-power- use it. </p>
<p>Not humanistic, eh ? No, it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s about survival. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have complete collapse of White race &amp; ultimately global civilization.  Not dissimilar to last E.G. Robinson&rsquo;s movie.</p>

But the UN prediction of two billion Africans in 30 years is going to be a game changer. Africa does not have jobs and infrastructure to support its current population, let alone double the present number. Either the US will have to donate signifcant amounts of GDP to &#8220;develop&#8221; Africa (like we did with our black homelands) or Africans will simply emigrate to wherever the bright lights are. High commodity prices are making Africans generally richer and more mobile, so I could easily see the ranks of &#8220;African Americans&#8221; swelling to 100 million within the next few decades.</p>

As you correctly point out the population explosion is neutralising these efforts. Therefore the non stop illegal immigrant, political asylum seeking stream of black Africans to Europe and North America. It is far easier to gravitate to the white man&rsquo;s world and be a parasite than it is to create your own utopia.<br/>
I saw it whilst working on a building contract in the UK. We employed a 40 year old Nigerian male to keep the site offices clean and tidy. How desperate must life be to be prepared to travel 2,000 miles just to push a broom and vacuum cleaner. Looked at another way; how abysmal is the Nigerian economy if they are incapable of creating such a job in their own back yard.</p>

<p>Until whites truly look at the source of this destruction, the end will march closer and closer.  I, myself, believe it is unstoppable at this point.  Because the forces at work against us are working by stealth and people still refuse to believe that conspiracies exist.  This is the one weapon our enemies never have to worry about being taken away or destroyed.  Because it is supported and defended by the very people it is being used against by denial.</p>
<p>Is it not white men who started and continue to support this destruction?  The Western World was on top of the world just fifty years ago?  How could we decline so quickly without help from within?</p>
<p>Globalism is the culprit and you better start looking at globalism as the culprit if you want any chance at all.  This is a synchronized attack all over the Western World and it is being led by the same people.  People that look just like us.  World domination is the goal but they must first destroy their ONLY threat.  People that look like them.</p>

&#8220;The latest proposal is for all charities, such as orphanages or soup kitchens, to lose their non-profit status if they serve any whites at all. It would mean that charitable organizations could serve only blacks, and that whites would not be allowed to help each other in any organized way, even to alleviate poverty or care for orphaned children.&#8221;I cannot find any stories about this despite a fairly extensive Internet search - is it possible to provide links. I&rsquo;m interested in reading more about these proposals. Thank you for your service!</p>

<p>A Warning to America from South Africa by Gemma Meyer</p>
<p>(Gemma Meyer is the pseudonym of a South African journalist.<br/>
She and her husband, a former conservative member of parliament,<br/>
still reside in South Africa.)</p>
<p>&#8221;People<br/>
used to say that South Africa was 20 years behind the rest<br/>
of the Western world. Television, for example, came late to<br/>
South Africa (but so did pornography and the gay rights movement).</p>
<p>Today, however, South Africa may be the grim model of the<br/>
future Western world, for events in America reveal trends<br/>
chillingly similar to those that destroyed our country. </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s structures are Western. Your Congress, your lobbying<br/>
groups, your free speech, and the way ordinary Americans either<br/>
get involved or ignore politics are peculiarly Western, not<br/>
the way most of the world operates. But the fact that only<br/>
about a third of Americans deem it important to vote is horrifying<br/>
in light of how close you are to losing your Western character.</p>
<p>Writing letters to the press, manning stands at county fairs,<br/>
hosting fund-raising dinners, attending rallies, setting up<br/>
conferences, writing your Congressman - that is what you know,<br/>
and what you are comfortable with. Those are the political<br/>
methods you&rsquo;ve created for yourselves to keep your country<br/>
on track and to ensure political accountability.</p>
<p>But woe to you if - or more likely, when - the rules change.<br/>
White Americans may soon find themselves unable or unwilling<br/>
to stand up to challenge the new political methods that will<br/>
be the inevitable result of the ethnic metamorphosis now taking<br/>
place in America. </p>
<p>Unable to cope with the new rules of the<br/>
game - violence, mob riots, intimidation through accusations<br/>
of racism, demands for proportionality based on racial numbers,<br/>
and all the other social and political weapons used by the<br/>
have-nots to bludgeon treasure and power from the haves -<br/>
Americans, like others before them, will no doubt cave in.<br/>
They will compromise away their independence and ultimately<br/>
their way of life.</p>
<p>That is exactly what happened in South Africa. I know, because<br/>
I was there and I saw it happen.</p>
<p>Faced with revolution in the streets, strikes, civil unrest<br/>
and the sheer terror and murder practiced by Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s<br/>
African National Congress (ANC), the white government simply<br/>
capitulated in order to achieve &#8220;peace.&#8221; </p>
<p>Westerners need peace. They need order and stability. They<br/>
are builders and planners. But what we got was the peace of<br/>
the grave for our society.</p>
<p>The Third World is different - different peoples with different<br/>
pasts and different cultures. Yet Westerners continue to mistake<br/>
the psychology of the Third World and its peoples. Sierra<br/>
Leone and Zimbabwe are perfect examples of those mistakes. </p>
<p>Sierra Leone is in perpetual civil war, and Zimbabwe - once<br/>
the thriving, stable Rhodesia - is looting the very people<br/>
(the white men) who feed the country. Yet Westerners do not<br/>
admit that the same kind of savagery could come to America<br/>
when enough immigrants of the right type assert themselves. </p>
<p>The fact is, Americans are sitting ducks for Third World exploitation<br/>
of the Western conscience of compassion.</p>
<p>Those in the West who forced South Africa to surrender to<br/>
the ANC and its leaders did not consider Africa to be the<br/>
dangerous, corrupt, and savage place it is now in Zimbabwe<br/>
and South Africa. Those Western politicians now have a similar<br/>
problem looming on their own doorsteps: the demand for power<br/>
and treasure from the non-Western peoples inside the realm.</p>
<p>It is already too late for South Africa, but not for America<br/>
if enough people strengthen their spine and take on the race<br/>
terrorists, the armies of the &#8220;politically correct&#8221;<br/>
and, most dangerous of all, the craven politicians who believe<br/>
&#8220;compassionate conservatism&#8221; will buy them a few<br/>
more votes, a few more days of peace.</p>
<p>White South Africans, you should remember, have been in that<br/>
part of Africa for the same amount of time whites have inhabited<br/>
North America; yet ultimately South Africans voted for their<br/>
own suicide. We are not so very different from you.</p>
<p>We lost our country through skillful propaganda, pressure<br/>
from abroad (not least from the U.S.A.), unrelenting charges<br/>
of &#8220;oppression&#8221; and &#8220;racism,&#8221; and the<br/>
shrewd assessment by African tyrants that the white man has<br/>
many Achilles&rsquo; heels, the most significant of which are his<br/>
compassion, his belief in the &#8220;equality of man,&#8221;<br/>
and his &#8220;love your neighbor&#8221; philosophy - none of<br/>
which are part of the Third World&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The mainline churches played a big role in the demise of Western<br/>
influence throughout Africa, too; especially in South Africa.<br/>
Today&rsquo;s tyrants were yesterday&rsquo;s mission-school proteges.<br/>
Many dictators in Africa were men of the cloth. They knew<br/>
their clerical collars would deflect criticism and obfuscate<br/>
their real aims, which had nothing whatever to do with the<br/>
&#8220;brotherhood of man.&#8221; </p>
<p>Other tyrants, like the infamous Idi Amin, were trained and<br/>
schooled by the whites themselves, at Oxford, Cambridge, and<br/>
Harvard. After receiving the best from the West, they unleashed<br/>
a resentful bloodlust against their benefactors.</p>
<p>From what I have seen and read thus far, I fear Americans<br/>
will capitulate just as we did. Americans are, generally,<br/>
a soft lot. They don&rsquo;t want to quarrel or obstruct the claims<br/>
of those who believe they were wronged. They like peace and<br/>
quiet, and they want to compromise and be nice.</p>
<p>A television program that aired in South Africa showed a town<br/>
meeting somewhere in Southern California where people met<br/>
to complain about falling standards in the schools. Whites<br/>
who politely spoke at the meeting clearly resented the influx<br/>
of Mexican immigrants into their community. When a handful<br/>
of Chicanos at the back of the hall shouted and waved their<br/>
hands at them, the whites simply shrunk back into their seats<br/>
rather than tell the noisemakers to shut up. They didn&rsquo;t want<br/>
to quarrel.</p>
<p>In America, the courts are still the final arbiters of society&rsquo;s<br/>
laws. But what will happen when your future majority refuses<br/>
to abide by court rulings - as in Zimbabwe. What will happen<br/>
when the new majority says the judges are racists, and that<br/>
they refuse to acknowledge &#8220;white man&rsquo;s justice&#8221;?<br/>
What will happen when the courts are filled with their people,<br/>
or their sympathizers? In California, Proposition 187 has<br/>
already been overturned.</p>
<p>What will you do when the future non-white majority decides<br/>
to change the names of streets and cities? What will you do<br/>
when they no longer want to use money that carries the portraits<br/>
of old, dead white &#8220;racists&#8221; and slave owners? Will<br/>
you cave in, like you did on flying the Confederate flag?<br/>
What about the national anthem? Your official language?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh. When the &#8220;majority&#8221; took over in South<br/>
Africa, the first targets were our national symbols.</p>
<p>In another generation, America may well face what Africa is<br/>
now experiencing - invasions of private land by the &#8220;have-nots;&#8221;<br/>
the decline in health care quality; roads and buildings in<br/>
disrepair; the banishment of your history from the education<br/>
of the young; the revolutionization of your justice system.</p>
<p>In South Africa today, only 9 percent of murderers end up<br/>
in jail. Court dockets are regularly purchased and simply<br/>
disappear. Magistrates can be bribed as can the prison authorities,<br/>
making escapes commonplace. Vehicle and airplane licenses<br/>
are regularly purchased, and forged school and university<br/>
certificates are routine.</p>
<p>What would you think of the ritual slaughter of animals in<br/>
your neighbor&rsquo;s backyard? How do you clean up the blood and<br/>
entrails that litter your suburban streets? How do you feel<br/>
about the practice of witchcraft, in which the parts of young<br/>
girls and boys are needed for &#8220;medicinal&#8221; purposes?<br/>
How do you react to the burning of witches? </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh. All that is quite common in South Africa today.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t imagine that government officials caught with their<br/>
fingers in the till will be punished. Excuses - like the need<br/>
to overcome generations of white racism - will be found to<br/>
exonerate the guilty.</p>
<p>In fact, known criminals will be voted into office because<br/>
of a racial solidarity among the majority that doesn&rsquo;t exist<br/>
among the whites. When Ian Smith of the old Rhodesia tried<br/>
to stand up to the world, white South African politicians<br/>
were among the Westerners pressuring him to surrender.</p>
<p>When Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe murders his political opponents,<br/>
ignores unfavorable court decisions, terrorizes the population<br/>
and siphons off millions from the state treasury for himself<br/>
and his friends, South Africa&rsquo;s new President Thabo Mbeki<br/>
holds his hand and declares his support. That just happened<br/>
a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Your tax dollars will go to those who don&rsquo;t earn and don&rsquo;t<br/>
pay. In South Africa, organizations that used to have access<br/>
to state funds such as old age homes, the arts, and veterans&rsquo;<br/>
services, are simply abandoned.</p>
<p>What will happen is that Western structures in America will<br/>
be either destroyed from without, or transformed from within,<br/>
used to suit the goals of the new rulers. And they will reign<br/>
either through terror, as in Zimbabwe today, or exert other<br/>
corrupt pressures to obtain, or buy votes. </p>
<p>Once power is in<br/>
the hands of aliens, don&rsquo;t expect loyalty or devotion to principle<br/>
from those whose jobs are at stake. One of the most surprising<br/>
and tragic components of the disaster in South Africa is how<br/>
many previously anti-ANC whites simply moved to the other<br/>
side.</p>
<p>Once you lose social, cultural, and political dominance, there<br/>
is no getting it back again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your habits and values work against you. You<br/>
cannot fight terror and street mobs with letters to your Congressmen.<br/>
You cannot fight accusations of racism with prayer meetings.<br/>
You cannot appeal to the goodness of your fellow man when<br/>
the fellow man despises you for your weaknesses and hacks<br/>
off the arms and legs of his political opponents.</p>
<p>To survive, Americans must never lose the power they now enjoy<br/>
to people from alien cultures. Above all, don&rsquo;t put yourselves<br/>
to the test of fighting only when your backs are against the<br/>
wall. You will probably fail.</p>
<p>Millions around the world want your good life. But make no<br/>
mistake: They care not for the high-minded ideals of Thomas<br/>
Jefferson and George Washington, and your Constitution. What<br/>
they want are your posessions, your power, and your status.</p>
<p>And they already know that their allies among you, the &#8220;human<br/>
rights activists,&#8221; the skillful lawyers and the left-wing<br/>
politicians will fight for them, and not for you. They will<br/>
exploit your compassion and your Christian charity, and your<br/>
good will. </p>
<p>They have studied you, Mr. and Mrs. America, and they know<br/>
your weaknesses well. </p>
<p>They know what to do.Do you? &#8221;</p>

<p>Read &#8220;Julian&#8221; by Gode Vidal. It is an historical account of the Roman Emperor Julian in novel form. Julian wanted to turn Rome back to the &#8220;true gods.&#8221; He despised Christianity and had the same opinion (from the article above) about the Christian bishops and priests of his time-a bunch of money-grubbing,  property-stealing  con-men who only wanted power, and who decieved people by appropriating Mithraic traditions and by pure political manipulation.  He was convinced that the new religion weakened the Empire.</p>

<p>After years of emigration, many are now returning, especially as the economies of the rich world have stumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know Europe is in trouble, the United States economy is weak as well,&rdquo; said John Loos, an economist at First National Bank.</p>

The site used to run a comments forum but shut it down as 99% of the posts were from people informing readers why they were leaving SA against their will - crime, job discrimination, no future for their children being the main reasons.</p>
<p>The easiest way to check if this reverse trend is in fact taking place is to interview the managers of household removal companies. The last I read they were being overwhelmed with enquiries and business to move families out of the country.</p>

South Africa has, entirely predictably, gone the same way as every other country in Africa following transition to black rule: i.e. it has collapsed into barbarism. tribalism, corruption, incompetence, violence and criminality. </p>
<p>Highest homicide rate in the worlds. Highest rape rate in the world. Highest AIDS infection rate in the world. Economic backwardisation. The collapse of a once highly productive farming econony. The virtual genocide of the Boer farmers (studiously ignored by western leftists and our media)<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147479" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Back in the 70s in South Africa I befriended a New Zealander who was on his walkabout to see and experience life in Europe. Being an avid rugby fan he stopped off in SA for 4 years.</p>
<p>Inevitably our conversations got around to the apartheid system, particularly as he worked as a site engineer [civil] on major construction projects which involved managing black manual workers.</p>
<p>He said the average perception of blacks in SA by New Zealanders was that they were exactly the same as whites, the only difference being that they had a black skin. This is why they were so pro SA blacks and anti SA whites whenever they were fed the carefully selected media clips by the liberal media.<br/>
They had been taught that blacks were discriminated against only because of the colour of their skin. There was no knowledge of 9 different tribes with their own languages, heritage and customs or capability to do jobs in the sophisticated technical white western society or manage themselves within western democratic structures.</p>
<p>His first reaction on stepping off the ship in Durban harbour was; &#8220;where is all this oppression and segregation I had been taught. All the blacks I saw were well fed, well dressed and going about their blue collar work with smiles and laughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time he moved on to England he had a far greater grasp of the complexities of Africa and white co-existence with the local people PLUS what the so called evil white man was actually doing for the upliftment and transition of these people to western ways. </p>
<p>The contact westerners had with black South Africans were the ones who had obtained an education through white created and managed institutions. They were the thin veneer on the top of the proletariat and successfully mobilised liberal support against the whites, particularly the Afrikaaners.</p>

Regardless of his private life the public image of Martin Luther King outside of the South was of a humble man of God who was too good of a Christian to hate his enemies.  <br/>

Segregationists did not have any leaders of the caliber of Dr. King. Outside of the South his enemies were perceived of as bullies and thugs. <br/>

Even George Wallace did not acquire a national following until the black ghetto riots began to convince many in the North that blacks were a problem. By then the civil rights legislation had been passed. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147830" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I admit the South has been let down by its leaders in the twentieth century. We haven&rsquo;t had great leaders like  Thomas Jefferson, John C. Calhoun and Robert E Lee. The images of peaceful demonstrators being mauled by Bull Conner&rsquo;s police dogs in Birmingham Alabama did not sit well with most respectable Americans. However, while Jim Crow segregation had some petty and ridiculous aspects, it was based on racial realities, not liberal fantasies.  Today, if given a chance, most whites  choice to self segregate.  Our Constitutional right of freedom of association has been curtailed by government tyranny.<br/>
Addtionally,I don&rsquo;t consider Martin Luther King to be a great leader, particularly because of his communist affiliations  and many moral  improprieties. If not for his unfortunate martyrdom by a criminal assassin, I doubt we would have had his current apotheosis and cult of worship .He was heading for irrelevancy in old age. George Wallace and Lester Maddox were inrticulate buffoons, who were transformed into red neck boggy men by the MSM.</p>

A great leader achieves his goals. Martin Luther King did. <br/>
            <br/>
His &#8220;I Have a Dream Speech  is one of the most eloquent in the English language.<br/>

        <br/>
His friends in the American Communist Party would only be a matter of legitimate concern if he passed classified information to the Soviet Union. There is no evidence that he ever did. <br/>
                          <br/>
His sex life was unacceptable in a Christian clergyman. Nevertheless, as a famous, charismatic, and prestigious man he faced temptations most of us do not.     </p>

Plenty of charismatic tyrants (Hitler, Lenin, and Castro) have made eloquent speeches that have moved their publics. I&rsquo;m not saying that Reverend King was a despicable tyrant, he was not, but he was self serving in many cases. I agree with shmo123 about King&rsquo;s hypocritical morality. When you set yourself up as a secular saint, you better be careful how you conduct your personal life. After the passage of the Civil Rights Act, King was becoming irrelevant, almost a travesty of his former self. His tragic death elevated him to undeserved deification. Does he deserve an important place in U.S. History? Yes, but there is something unseemly about the current cult of King worship. </p>

One particular event comes to mind-the murder of a housewife from Detroit, Viola Liuzzo.  For one, what the hell was a housewife with children doing riding around with blacks in the south?? Didn&rsquo;t she have young children and a husband to take care of??<br/>
Her death was unfortunate-and provided &#8220;fuel&#8221; for the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; crowd.  I often wonder if the civil rights organizations&rsquo; &#8220;planners&#8221; and &#8220;handlers&#8221; deliberately &#8220;set her up&#8221; as a &#8220;sacrificial lamb&#8221; in order to further their aims.   For those that dispute my take on the violence by civil rights proponents that was not reported as such, I WAS THERE.</p>

<p>I immediately thought about the plight of S. African whites after the recent re-election of Obama and how American whites could find themselves in a similar situation in one or two decades hence.   You see, whites, especially white Americans, have lost the will to survive and it truly pains me to come to this conclusion.  Furthermore, Obama has charted a new course for the Democratic party and their radical non-white base and the goofy, deracinated white liberals who love them will now demand nothing less than a fringe leftist who despises white people.   It will be rough seas with no end in sight from this point forward.   </p>
<p>The &#8220;racist&#8221; Republican party is catching mestizo fever and seems eager to diversify its ranks and kick its traditional white base of support to the curb.  It&rsquo;s so called leaders are self-serving hucksters and sellouts.  They are no longer a countervailing force to the loony, anti-white left if they ever were to begin with.</p>

<p>&#8221;I have been waiting for an authoritative comment on the article by Roger Highfield and Charles Clover (Science, Feb. 1) suggesting that Aids began as a result of people in Central Africa eating certain<br/>
chimpanzees. As none has been forthcoming, your readers – and perhaps  the medical profession    might like to know of my own experience.</p>
<p>In 1957, as a student nurse, I was working at the Fever Hospital in Johannesburg. Patients were sent to us from all over Africa. Few could speak English, so could not describe their symptoms in detail or tell us how they might have contracted their particular illness.</p>
<p>I remember clearly the first patient who came in with very odd sores. A lot of tests were done – saliva, tears, blood, etc. – but we could not identify it&rsquo;s problem, and he died. Suddenly there was a spate of<br/>
similar cases, all from Central Africa and all ending in the patient&rsquo;s death. The hospital asked a mission station in the Belgian Congo (as it then was) to send someone down to tell us more about their lifestyle and what they ate.</p>
<p>We were told that in the Congo there was an endearing little monkey, grey but with a green sheen to its coat. While other chimps and monkeys were hunted and eaten – as they still are all over Africa – these were adopted as pets and even venerated, as people believed that the green sheen had mystic powers. Despite this veneration (or perhaps because of it), I was taken aback to learn that men copulated with them, some apparently picking up some sort of virus as a result.</p>
<p>When we realised that we did not know how to cure these very ill men,we decided there was no point in admitting any more. They simply stayed at home and died. We called it green monkey disease; some time later our professor, Jock Gear, said he was sure they were the first cases of Aids to come to official notice.</p>
<p>One question remains to be answered. Presumably humans had had sexual relations with these monkeys for a very long time. So why was it only in the 1950s, and only in a relatively small area of Central Africa, that the monkeys contracted the virus, and passed it on? Where did they<br/>
get it from? &#8221;</p>

When the United Nations puts out papers stating how wonderful it would be to create viruses that kill people by using their own immune systems against them, it is clear evidence AIDS did not appear naturally. There are scientists who have exposed some other facts about how AIDS was not only engineered in a laboratory, it was also deliberately injected into gay men and drug users who spread disease far and wide. The Polio vaccines have been shown to also been tainted with a virus that like Ebola and AIDS attacks the brain. Given that AIDS kills Africans especially effectively, I would say it could be an ethnic bioweapon. </p>

<p><a href="http://tia-mysoa.blogspot.co.uk/Article" rel="nofollow">http://tia-mysoa.blogspot.co.uk/Article</a>: South Africa - The Final CountdownWhite charities set up by whites to assist whites are now being compelled by law to spend a maximum of 10% of their resources on whites. They remainder is expected to go to blacks.This is what is happening in a country where the 10% minority white population generate about 75% of the nations tax revenue through their entrepreneurship and commerce. This tax revenue is administered by the black government for the benefit of the black population on all 3 tiers of government - city, province and national. So even with this massive advantage they still have to effectively steal from white charities.It is also worth noting that with the AA and BEE [Black Economic Empowerment] laws many whites have been expelled from their jobs - particularly in municipal, provincial, state and parastatal employment. These jobs have now been taken over by blacks thus creating the new emerging black middle class. At present there is no information available about them creating charities to support their own.Within this article there are 2 Youtube clips:<br/>
WARNING!The following video contains scenes that are not suitable for young or sensitive viewers.<br/>
 http://youtu.be/I-60MZnc2dY</p>
<p>This deals with the years 1980 to 1990 in the run up to ending apartheid and then majority rule.<br/>
It is quite sad to see that the only voice of reason was Ronald Reagan while the rest of the world mislead by the liberal western media did everything in its power to end white rule - first in Rhodesia and then in South Africa. <br/>
In the TV documentary series Have You Heard from Johannesburg, British MP Barbara Castle swoons over what a &#8220;charming and reasonable man Oliver Tambo is&#8221;. This clip will show you the real Tambo in action. Johannesburg International Airport is now named after this fiend to honour him.</p>
<p>The second clip:<br/>
<a href="http://youtu.be/8W8yrkM96sU" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/8W8yrkM96sU</a><br/>
will give American readers an opportunity to see their Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in action on her jaunts to South Africa.<br/>

Part of the answer to Mr. Roodt&rsquo;s question: because F.W. DeKlerk, a white South African leader, sold out his white countrymen. Yes, the American elite urged DeKlerk to sell out, but in the end it was DeKlerk himself who enacted the surrender of South Africa to black rule. That, and the fact that white South Africans - who were well-armed, simply gave up with hardly a whimper. It was one of the most cowardly and disgraceful acts in the entire history of the white race. </p>
<p>White South Africa is dead. Any attempt - short of placing suitcase nukes in downtown Pretoria - will not restore white rule there. Durban, for instance, is a seething, rotten, leprous hell-hole jam-packed with licorice-colored sub-humans. The only thing left for whites to do is abandon their once prosperous and proud land and flee to Australia, the closest thing to their former homeland remaining on this planet. </p>

It was one of the most cowardly and disgraceful acts in the entire history of the white race.&#8221;Not true.                                                                                                                                                                            Do some reading on the bush war / Angolan conflict. SA was fighting a proxy war on behalf of the west - especially the USA - to stem the spread of communism in Africa. The small SA forces had routed the opposition despite massive support from the eastern block and Cuban forces and had advanced to the hills overlooking the Angolan capital Luanda. The military commanders then awaited instructions from the politicians who in turn were waiting for the USA to fulfill it&rsquo;s pledge of support. What happened? The USA reneged on its agreement and congress packed up and went home for Christmas. This was the big betrayal plus the efforts of Kissinger leading from the front forcing the whites to capitulate. White SA was deluded into believing that the Mandela led ANC was a moderate organisation capable of managing a country with a first world infrastructure. Since his departure the true ANC has revealed its colours and the very communist state that the Afrikaner National Party had warned against for 40 years has now become the reality they fought against. If you want to blame any white group it is the white liberals in the west and SA that are responsible for what has come to pass. We can only hope that conservative forces in the USA will organise themselves to stop the same thing happening there.</p>

They did so in Spain back in the eight century A.D. They did so in Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Ukraine, Russia and every other country where there was a non-white invasion. This is why whites must NEVER allow their futures to ever be under the control of Jews or any other racial or religious aliens ever again.</p>

<p>Slightly related; the police here are presently investigating the disappearance of a child in south west Sydney, the Muslim family are refusing to cooperate, the news report also mentioned that this family has 13 children, yes, thirteen!

<p>But it should not be inevitable that the USA, Australia, Western Europe, Canada and NZ should now be overrun by 3rd World, African, Asian or Muslim immigrants and I do mean overrun because this is what is happening. Like the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of White South Africa  our invasion by inappropriate immigration was unthinkable only a generation or so ago.</p>

<p>To add further support to my theory - I read somewhere that de Klerk was once considered very right wing, and thus very unlikely to support black rule.   I think he was paid handsomely (not just the Nobel prize which alone is worth $millions) to sell-out his country and people.  Thats why I always call him &#8220;Judas&#8221;.   </p>

<p>He was adamant that his so-called &#8220;stroke&#8221; was not natural, but that he was poisoned. Apparently the dosage was not high enough to kill him, but caused symptoms not far removed from those of a stroke. However, he was examined by all the specialists at 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria, none of whom found evidence of a stroke.</p>
<p>As you say, the &#8220;stroke&#8221; incident was then used by FW de Klerk to depose PW Botha and embark on what finally turned out to be military surrender to a third-rate terrorist group, the ANC, which could never have taken South Africa by any other means as our army was about number 4 or 5 in the world.</p>
<p>I further suspect that De Klerk&rsquo;s brother, Willem, had been recruited by British Intelligence even while he was still editor of the Transvaler newspaper. Shortly before De Klerk took the decision to unban the ANC and release Mandela, Willem de Klerk was called to London by British Intelligence for a stay in a hotel, after which he went back to brief FW on what the Britons thought should be done.</p>
<p>Robin Renwick, the British ambassador at the time in South Africa, had also engineered the demise of Rhodesia at Lancaster House in 1979, so he knew how to play the various white factions off against another to get radical blacks into power.</p>

Botha&rsquo;s main role was to undermine and alter the attitudes of the<br/>

Minister of Sports and General Tienie Groenewald, head of the military<br/>

During the very heady anti-apartheid days in the early 80s we used to visit a (very dear) friend who was all into peace, love,harmony and of course the anti-apartheid movement. On one visit I looked at some of their literature, there was a picture of Pik Botha and the instructions were to get your children to gouge his eyes out (of the picture) using a sharp pencil. Did someone say peace, love and harmony?</p>

I checked this with a colleague and we both agree on the following:Anton Rupert [RIP] was an Afrikaner not a JewThe ANC was founded in 1912 not 1963The National Party came to power in 1948 - not in the 1960sFW de Klerk was never a Freemason - more than likely a member of the BroederbondOppenheimer&rsquo;s wealth came from mining - diamonds and gold, not bankingRupert&rsquo;s wealth came from cigarettes and alcohol - manufacture &amp; distributionlater they both may have bought into banks but they were not bankersWhat proof is there that Vorster motivated the assassination of Verwoerd?What proof is there that Pik Botha was a CIA agent?At the time Afrikaners were dividing into two camps - conservative and reformistBotha was in the reformist campTrevor Manuel Jewish? I doubt it. He was an Afrikaans speaking coloured.</p>

<p>I remember when I was first fully awakened. Shortly after the Zimmerman incident I realized the media was 100% a propaganda machine. Not just a little bias, but complete liars for the sake of the establishment. I soon found AmRen and the alt-Right. Every article made my blood boil, decades worth of lies, cover-ups and anti-White agendas. </p>
<p>What caused the USSR to shatter? A <i>financial crisis</i>.  What caused Yugoslavia to shatter? A <i>financial crisis</i>. What is causing Greece&rsquo;s Golden Dawn to rise? <i>financial crisis</i>. What has the West (including SA) not seen since the Great Depression? A <i>financial crisis</i>. What is just around the corner for the US? A <i>financial crisis</i>.</p>
<p>War is coming, plain and simple. I hope to survive it and rebuild a worthwhile nation when it is over. My survival depends on how well I prepare, so now with Obama back in office, I must re-double my efforts. I wish you all the best of luck, except for Engelman, I hope he gets exiled to China where the Chinese spit on him everyday because he&rsquo;s White.</p>

American use tools   &mdash;   keeps a man grounded in reality and gives his some appreciation for cooperation. Young white men do not seem to me to be   &mdash;   in sufficient numbers, to a sufficient degree, at any rate - grounded in reality. So many of them claim &#8220;technology&#8221; backgrounds because they sell things (actually, usually services) online &amp; can keep count of clicks. As we&rsquo;ve ceded power to blacks, we&rsquo;ve corrupted our own. So BMF, I&rsquo;m with you in the fight but I do not assess the odds very favourably at the moment, my friend.</p>

<p>The first post-apartheid leader, Mandela was a relative moderate respected by many whites.  Each successive leader after him has turned further away from whites.</p>
<p>Like Mandela, Obama appeals to liberal whites.  He sounds moderate for the still large white demographic.   As the demographics change, however,  we could see more radical leaders who will be less moderate and further disregard the interests of whites.  And these future leaders won&rsquo;t need the support of  liberal whites.</p>
<p>As for those poor and persecuted whites in South Africa, shouldn&rsquo;t countries like the Netherlands and the UK be offering them the chance to seek asylum or have some sort of right of return?  They are after all their diaspora.</p>

Read the links I have given you and you will see that Britain started passing segregationist [apartheid] legislation - eg pass laws -  in the Cape [post 1806] and Natal [post 1843] before the Boer Republics came into being - OFS 1854 and ZAR 1856.<br/>
Under the Union Governments with pro British PMs from 1910 this continued until 1948 when the National Party came to power. All they did was give the existing status quo the name of Apartheid = Segregation. Another way of looking at it was Formal Apartheid took the place of Informal [i.e. un-named] Apartheid.<br/>
Thereafter the NP set about developing the homelands and returning them to the tribes as western democracies after they had been conquered by the British between 1806 and 1902, forced to become British subjects and incorporated into the British construct the Union of South Africa. This African Yugoslavia was designed to provide the cheap labour source for the British owned diamond and gold mines, the lust for which precipitated the two Anglo-Boer Wars - or from the Boer / Afrikaner perspective Vryheidsoorlog: Wars of Freedom [Independence}</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-148439" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;Britain invented Apartheid&#8221;.   I think that claim is a bit of a stretch.   Certainly Britain did introduce some features of Apartheid - you mention &#8220;pass laws&#8221; but many authoritarian govts have similar laws even today, in China for example you I believe you cannot just leave the country and go and live in a city.   On the other hand the Cape Colony had a colour-blind constitution - blacks and coloureds could vote if they owned property.  Even this small measure of &#8220;democracy&#8221; for blacks would have been anathema to the Boers.   </p>
<p>And under British rule I&rsquo;m sure blacks were given a minimal education (if at all) - &#8220;British Bantu Education&#8221; if you will.    But most of the other elements, e.g., the &#8220;Immorality Act&#8221;, &#8220;separate facilities&#8221;, etc (so-called &#8220;Petty Apartheid&#8221;) and the very strict hierarchy of racial classification, group areas acts, etc, etc, if not their original ideas they were reinforced and formalised by the Nationalist govts of 1948 on.  It is claimed by the usual suspects that there were over 300 apartheid laws but I suspect thats a wild exaggeration.</p>
<p>Anyway I don&rsquo;t want to get into a tit-for-tat over this as the important point - one that was never strongly made by the Nats - was that none of these laws were intended to be vindictive they were made in order to protect whites from the predations - petty and otherwise - of blacks.  And the protection of whites was in the long run essential for the protection of blacks.  </p>
<p>Everything that has occurred since 1994 has served to justify the reasons for apartheid - this is what I always tell people, and mostly they don&rsquo;t have an answer for that because they know its true.          </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-153127" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My apologies for taking so long to respond.<br/>
The two links I provide are an excellent resource regarding the legislative trail of segregation / apartheid in SA. I have not counted them but 300 national statutes, provincial ordinances and municipal bye-laws across the nation would not be far off the mark.<br/>
We must remember that the British class system was the order of the day and their law making effectively defined and entrenched this system. In the Cape the social pecking order was White British, White Afrikaner, Coloureds and Blacks after slavery was abolished. In Natal it was White British, White Afrikaner, Indian and Blacks.<br/>
The Progressive Party in the 70s tried to revive the qualified franchise based on property assets and minimum education but western liberals would have none of it. It was one man one vote or nothing. I suspect that the historical system in the Cape set the bar unattainably high enough to ensure white domination indefinitely.<br/>
The &#8220;seven pillars of apartheid&#8221; laws were really no different to the status quo of Europe which each nation is clearly defined on language, architecture, tradition and custom. What the Nationalists were trying to protect was independent black identity and nationalism and unravel the false unity created by the act of union.<br/>
The independent homelands would have created nine homogeneous states on a par with Lesotho and Swaziland - which were quite acceptable to the west.<br/>
The failure of multiparty western democracy in Zimbabwe is self evident where party political lines are drawn along tribal lines and not policy and principle.<br/>
The Nationalists were visionary enough to see this but of course the all knowing western liberals didn&rsquo;t have a clue and considered all blacks to be the same.<br/>
I think this internal tribal conflict within the ANC will eventually be the cause of it&rsquo;s demise. The unifying cause of battling the white man is now over and petty tribal differences and conflicts will rise to the fore.<br/>
What the west saw as divide and rule was actually the best solution for SA. PW Botha floated the idea of &#8220;a constellation of SA states&#8221; [i,e, federation] but ran out of time to implement it.<br/>
We are now seeing the wisdom of the NP policies come home to roost in that a black SA politician has called for education to revert to mother tongue as they are witnessing the loss of individual tribal identity. The younger generation now speak a dialect of black African-South African English and are losing their mother tongue heritage.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-149651" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>May I suggest you take a holiday to South Africa and spend time in the province of KwaZulu-Natal [KZN]. This territory became a British Colony in 1845 after the British ousted the Boer Voortrekkers who had trekked here between 1834 and 1838 to escape British oppression in what had become the British Cape Colony in 1806.<br/>
KZN is the most English of the old four provinces. As Dan Roodt correctly points the descendants of British settlers who reside there today see themselves as English-British before they see themselves as English-South African. This is born out by the fact that they take great pride in the provinces nick-name: The Last Outpost of The British Empire. It is quite a rude awakening when they visit the UK and discover that the British view then as colonials like Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians - despite their attempts to speak British English.<br/>
Study a South African telephone directory and note the number of British surnames you will find. It was not the Boere who named towns and cities like Malmesbury, Worcester, Wellington, Ashton, Montague, Robertson, Richmond, Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Harrysmith, Ladysmith, Smithfield, Newcastle, Colenso, Donnybrook, Eastwolds etc.<br/>
And two mainstream movies - Zulu [Michael Caine] and Zulu Dawn [Peter O'Toole] were filmed in KZN to tell the story of the Anglo-Zulu wars.</p>
<p>Your denial of your Anglo-South African heritage makes me feel quite sorry for the fellow who lived in our road and proudly raised the Union Jack in his front garden every day.<br/>
But I don&rsquo;t suppose that compares to the rejection pain that ex Rhodesian PM Ian Smith and others must feel who gave up a number of years of their youth to fight for Britain as fighter pilots and soldiers to combat Adolf Hitlers expansionist plans in Europe during WWII.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147472" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Although further decline in the US and Europe seems<br/>
inevitable, a good overall strategy and could political organization could slow<br/>
or reverse it.</p>
<p>Necessary, and first, would be a QUANTUM LEAP in<br/>
sophistication regarding communication and media.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor, for example, is good at explaining the Amren<br/>
position, but will never reach a large audience – certainly not a young one,<br/>
and that is what is decisive.</p>
<p>Second would be VERY sophisticated strategic choices:</p>
<p>the main objective is simple: to maintain a white majority, eliminate racial preferences.</p>
<p>immigration, social benefits for new arrivals, race<br/>
preferences, crime.</p>
<p>Third, a network of insiders and reliable financial support<br/>
(i.e. to find a gigantic and remorseless media campaign hammering the main<br/>
points: slow down immigration, phase out race preferences, no euphemisms when<br/>
discussing minority crime).</p>
<p>I think that whites have the skills and the numbers to at<br/>
least slow down if not reverse the current rush toward disaster, but not the<br/>
organizational skills, media, the determination, or the<br/>
confidence.</p>
<p>Example: NOT &#8220;these people are sucking us dry!!&#8221;, but instead &#8220;equality is the bedrock principle on which America stands, racial preferences are un-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Example: NOT &ldquo;Americans is drowning in a tide of useless<br/>
brown people,&rdquo; but instead:</p>
<p>the numbers just don&rsquo;t add up, we need an immigration<br/>
moratorium to reduce one (Numbers USA is very effective here).</p>
<p>example: NOT &ldquo;Blacks should have fewer children,&rdquo; but instead: &ldquo;we must eliminate<br/>
all obstacles to responsible family planning&rdquo; </p>
<p>Example: NOT: &ldquo;Blacks are dumb and violent, just like the<br/>
KKK always said&rdquo;, but instead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As everyone on earth, including blacks, always knew before<br/>
political correctness repressed reality, the cognitive functioning black is<br/>
very different from that of whites, and you are not doing blacks any favors by<br/>
pretending otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, some of the palpably lunacy of the right would<br/>
have to be sacrificed, particularly as regards birth control and abortion.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a white can succeed in Europe and US once it discards<br/>
a series of right wing pet peeves:</p>
<p>fetishizing the virtues of corporate behemoths: OUT!</p>
<p>Climate change denial: OUT!</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism, homophobia: OUT!</p>
<p>Shoving religion down people&rsquo;s throats: OUT!</p>
<p>Whites will win if we can get our priorities straight.</p>
<p>Otherwise we deserve to lose.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147528" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The root of the problem is African Ham race slavery 500 yrs ago once somebody ended white Shem race slavery in Europe. White slaves built and maintained all of Europe for 1000s of years didnt they? Why was it ended? Evil? Wasnt it to make way for Ham race slavery? Who was behind it and why?  Slaves were needed like a hole in the head in the west. This is the real problem and the paradox of it all is European whites did it to themselves and African blacks are 100% innocent and were meant to remain in their African zoo cage eternally as pets of their tribal chiefs only not to be slaves for whites.<br/>
Didnt Europeans know how to hire whites for wages to pick cotten or clean house? Who in the hell would be stupid enough to go out on a limb and buy Hamite African black slaves anyway but someone under a trance or spell of evil?<br/>
There is a much bigger story to this since white slavery had to end to open the door to the hideous mistaken trickery of using African slaves to do simple soft labor chores making them pets and farm animals of the owners.<br/>
There should have never been a single African black slave in the western hemisphere to this day in 2012. And Thomas Jefferson and the FFs could have easily ended slavery and sent them all back to Africa but failed to do so. Black slavery was a collosal catastrophic mistake to say the least. White slavery would have worked as it did for 1000s of yrs in Europe.<br/>
Why did the elite whites like Jefferson in all his wisdom understand that white Shem slaves were legal during not only the entire 3500 yrs of WMR time span for writing it down but also during the time span of Constantine who approved it all. Sure Ham was cursed but his race was in Africa and of zero consequence to the white race not bothering a white soul. </p>
<p>How could black slavery be justified in the west when in fact white slavery  was in existence the entire time span of their Book of WMR and was never a problem and in fact accepted as normal by their Messiah and Diety? Why did it end?<br/>
Jefferson using the Ham verse to justify black slavery is complete hypocrisy seeming to suggest that blacks were the only ones who should be slaves to the other 2 brothers yet ignoring the fact that white slaves were never called a sin and accepted and approved by the peasant Messiah and ancient jews.<br/>
Double standards.  Now who reaps the consequences of something so unneeded ? The ancient white Shem jews were right. The children always pay for the sins stupidity and ignorance of their fathers.<br/>
Whites were right about everything except ending white slavery and replacing it with black slavery during their period of western expansionism that was also a mistake apparently.</p>

<p>Know your enemy.  He is not Mexican or black. These people do not have the planning ability or resources to bring about your liquidation. Your real enemy is as white as you are, but his self-hatred leads him to desire his own race&rsquo;s destruction.

It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it be a single city or an entire country, as long as they dominate. </p>
<p>After importing the decisive votes over the last few decades, the people who designed these disasters may now have perpetual control of the U.S. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they will keep pushing the same policies that created these wastelands. Its not like their failures of South Africa, Rhodesia, American cities, or any socialist hell hole has ever stopped them before.</p>
<p>Seriously, have you ever heard one of them say that they are sorry for what happened to South Africa or Rhodesia after they put sanctions on those places; that they were given exactly what they wanted and these countries are utter failures precisely because they got what they wanted? No it hocus pocus lingering racism or the legacy of colonialism and slavery that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>The only consolation is that it is a mix of hispanics, leftist, and blacks that now make up the majority of the electorate. Imagine if it was exclusively blacks who now controlled America. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147653" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Can anyone here, maybe with more knowledge of political sci than I do, explain why the US and Great Britain have been so painfully incapable of defending our peoples with the kinds of effective nationalist, White parties that most of Europe has? I&rsquo;ll give my own probably iffy historical guesses on why, but this is an honest question that I don&rsquo;t understand. If they can do it, why can&rsquo;t we? For most of the past decade, I&rsquo;ve been working in Europe on cross country contracts, learned a bit of the languages to talk with the locals and keep up with the local press. Most of Europe is technologically advanced and facing the same PC attitudes in the media that we do in the US. Yet, most EU countries have a strong and reasonably successful defense of the nation party, or at the very least respected and forceful defenders in the mainstream parties, gaining real power and restricting third-world immigration, multiculturalism and similar plagues on the West.</p>
<p>There are the True Finns, one of the top Finnish parties in recent elections. Switzerland has recently banned minarets by referendum and posed such tight restrictions on mosques and halal that the 3rd population in the country is mostly leaving. Swede&rsquo;s Democrats, not sure of the full name, is gaining power and finally clamping down hard on non-Euro immigration- the major source of migrants to Sweden recently has been by Poles and Czechs! Dutch and Austria both have a Freedom Party, Belgium has Flaams Belang, Denmark has a people&rsquo;s Party, Italy and Hungary have tough defender parties with power that have thoroughly altered immigration laws. Greece for all it&rsquo;s troubles, is helping itself by massively deporting the 3rd world population there. Germany&rsquo;s leader openly shredded the idea of multiculturalism, and the country&rsquo;s Turkish population is leaving more and more every year. The BNP in the UK meanwhile is scorned even by &lsquo;conservatives&rsquo; there and is being deprived of power, often by shady means encouraged by government, media and even private business. The Poles were immigrating to UK for a while too but most are leaving for home or going to places like Sweden or Netherlands, since the British media and politicians treated them with such hostility. So the question remains, Why can&rsquo;t we in the USA and Britain protect ourselves with such nation-defending parties like the other European countries, rather than being stuck with the useless, traitorous Republicans or the equally useless Conservative Party in England, whose idea of &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; is screwing over the USA&rsquo;s White working class by out-sourcing all our jobs to Mexico and India?</p>
<p>This last point is informative, because the whole meaning of Leftist and Rightist in Europe is radically different, we don&rsquo;t even have a way to interpret it here in the US. In fact, I&rsquo;m not even sure the whole model of Lefists and Rightists even works there, it&rsquo;s got many more directions and more and more today at least, all sides seem to rally around defending the White culture, at least outside the UK. As example, France&rsquo;s current President Francis Holland was called &#8216;Leftist&rsquo; by the US press after he beat Sarkozy a few months ago, and on some economic issues he may seem that way. But on cultural and immigration issues he has a tougher line than Sarkozy or even many rabid conservative talk show hosts here in the US. He&rsquo;s been filling French documents and texts with harsh articles on how corrupt the Ottoman Turks, and obviously its modern successor have been, deliberately angering the thin-skinned Turkish politicians and helping to further encourage the Arab and Turkish population of Europe to leave. He&rsquo;s also clamped down hard on 3rd world immigration to France, he hates it because his cabinet argues that mass immigration pushes down wages of the French working class! This is the kind of obvious logic and nationalism that both Leftist and Rightist parties in the US and Britain should have, yet for us, they&rsquo;re both in favor of massive immigration to our countries for their own reasons. Why?</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m posing these questions I guess I should try to offer something resembling an answer to kick things off. I was a history minor and I naturally tend to look there first, so my guess about why the United States, and equally Britain and Canada, have so far been unable to mount such parties or national defenses in the mainstream parties, goes all the way back to the Norman Conquest in 1066. I got this sense from several stays in Britain. To my shock, a lot of the ugliest hatred and contempt for Britain&rsquo;s Anglo-Saxon and Celtic, working-class White population was always coming from the snobbish, upper-class land-holding gentry who even today hold Norman names in England. The weird thing is, most of these people were reliably members of the Tory Party, yet their &lsquo;conservatism&rsquo; largely consisted of attacking British White people as lazy scroungers, while celebrating themselves as being so cosmopolitan for inviting millions of Third World migrants from the Indian Subcontinent, Africa, the Caribbean and wherever else. Even after more than 900 years, these modern-day Normans still consider themselves to be superior to the lowly Anglo-Saxons and Celts, and they despise the non-upper class British Whites who make up the bulk of the country. So much that they want to replace British Whites with docile, stupid Third Worlders who will be willing to work as slaves.</p>
<p>Think about it, we usually and with justification attack the Leftists and cultural Marxists for all the damage they&rsquo;ve done to our societies. Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Lippmann in Australia, Ted Kennedy in the US, Hart and Celler, we all know how much they&rsquo;ve hurt us. But has The Right, at least in the US and UK, taken a different stance? Not where it counts. The Chamber of Commerce and upper-crust Rightists in the US and UK also support mass immigration from the Third World, increased out-sourcing of US and British jobs to Mexico or India, more H1B visas and even more foreign workers taking more jobs, cheaper labor and esp with the neocons, American and British Whites sent off to bleed for outrageous wars in the Mid-East that have nothing to do with us but make the upper crust, new Normans even more filthy rich. Margaret Thatcher for example is usually considered to be very conservative, but her &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; credentials amounted to little more than a full-scale war against Britain&rsquo;s White factory workers and working class in general, plus getting rid of the services that made sure British Whites could start families and raise their children. Meanwhile, Thatcher encouraged out-sourcing and increased mass immigration from Pakistan, India and other places in the Third World, all to knock down British wages even more.</p>
<p>The same goes for the Republican Party and &lsquo;conservatives&rsquo; in the US. The &lsquo;conservatives&rsquo; in the UK and US are nothing like the real conservatives in Europe, who defend their country&rsquo;s traditions and White population from being demographically or culturally overwhelmed by the Third World. While for our &lsquo;conservatives&rsquo; swamping out our own White populations is the goal, since it pushes down wages of the White majority and so makes the White upper class, banksters and country-club buddies of the rich even richer, surrounding by docile Third Worlders working for dimes and nickels. The very history of the 20th century was defined by this. World War I was the suicide of the West, and it was totally avoidable, but it happened because the White upper-crust in Britain and the US wanted it to happen. Woodrow Wilson, J.P. Morgan, the Rothschilds, Lloyd George, Lord Grey, Asqueth- they all knew that Britain and the US had no interests in fighting and prolonging the war in Europe. Geopolitically not to mention for the benefit of their peoples, they would have gained most by staying out, letting the continent come to realize the danger of the new war technologies and come to an early treaty. </p>
<p>But the banksters and the British upper class, and the American gentry that was sympathetic to the old Norman class in Britain, instead pushed to prolong the war to make themselves richer at the expense of Whites in general throughout the West. Their short-term financial interests were short sighted just like the plantation owners in the South, importing millions of African Blacks. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that a large number of the abolitionists in 1850 took their stance for very practical reasons- they could see all the trouble and unrest that would result from importing millions of Africans to the US, wanted to send them back, and wanted the US economy to be based on free, forward-thinking White labor and manufacturing, much like the culture and economy of the Germans. So now forward up to 1914, and who do these banksters and effete White upper-class members in the US and Britain make war on? The Germans, the very culture that had embodied and advanced the idea of a country becoming strong through the hard work of free white labor, without massive importing of millions of Third Worlders to work on the cheap.  </p>
<p>So that old Norman aristocracy still rules in Britain and sees itself as different and above the millions of Anglo-Saxons and Celts around them, hating the freedon-loving, hard-working British White masses enough to swamp them out altogether with the Third World. Same with our upper-class &lsquo;Normans&rdquo; here in the mansions and Chambers of Commerce in the US, who seem to have the same attitude, the same contempt for the White American masses, the same hatred of the idea of a society of free White labor and manufacturing, and the same push to swamp out the White American masses with the Third World. So we can gain nothing from our current party system and mainstream &lsquo;conservatives&rsquo; whose ideology, like the Leftists here, is designed to demographically replace us. And, maybe because of this cultural divide and history, we in the US and Britain are stuck with a White upper class that identifies and works directly against the White majority even since the Norman Conquest, something you don&rsquo;t find in other White countries with a different history. If that&rsquo;s the case, then we probably need some kind of historical revisit-ing to literally get a handle on this self-dividing culture within White America, and realize our common interests.</p>
<p>I admit this is just a guess, historical-based because it&rsquo;s what I studied. As I know next to nothing about political sci, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s an explanation to be found in the institutions like the courts or common law structure, the way our government is structured or some other factor that could more easily explain it.</p>

That is too say, don&rsquo;t they cast a net wide enough to include &#8220;patriotic&#8221; non-White Christians, Hindus, Jews and &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslims? Please, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.<br/>
But in terms of nationalist politics in these dusky days of Western civilization, surely we should all unite against race-mixing. My impression is that the NF has a more clearly &#8220;race realist&#8221; approach to the pressing demographic and cultural issues of our day, as Anglo-Saxons stare down the barrel of extinction. </p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-147979" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>These are very interesting comments. I think many societies decline because of a loss of identity. Or they have conflicting identities, which in England may be traced back to the Norman invasion as you suggest.</p>
<p>In South Africa, we have always had a conflict between the indigenous white or Afrikaner identity and the colonial British one. When there was a referendum on becoming a Republic in 1960, the white electorate voted narrowly in favour. Natal province, although politically conservative, voted 76% against the Republic as they wanted to remain under the British queen as titular head of state.</p>
<p>Eventually the vast majority of whites had a strong South African identity. But a small, liberal/leftist minority identified more with Britain and especially the values of the British Labour Party. This was true of the academics and the journalists who were all trained at the universities. Despite being a minority, they had powerful institutions on their side, such as the English-language press and the four very liberal universities: Wits, Cape Town, Rhodes and Natal. The British churches too, were on their side, such as the Anglicans and the Methodists; in South Africa they more or less espoused the Marxist so-called &#8220;theology of liberation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Finance came from abroad: from Britain, Sweden and Norway. Together with the intense propaganda campaign orchestrated in the world media in the 1980s and betrayed by FW de Klerk who tricked them into thinking he would make only certain concessions but not surrender completely, the SA whites finally capitulated.</p>
<p>What those European patriotic parties have in their favour, is that they are drawing on the strong national identity of some European nations. Those identities have not yet been divided although the multiculturalists are trying their best by referring to Muslims and Africans as &#8220;New Swedes&#8221;, &#8220;New Germans&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor in his book on &#8220;White Identity&#8221; also makes the point that whites in the USA will have to adopt a strong identity, just like the other races of blacks, Hispanics and Asians. But together with such a racial identity, I think white Americans must also celebrate their cultural and historical heritage.</p>
<p>One of the lessons of history is that a people without an identity will not resist. That is also why liberals and socialists fear nationalism. The former French Socialist president, François Mitterand, said: &#8220;Le nationalisme, c&rsquo;est la guerre&#8221;, or nationalism is war or means war. That is not true, but without some form of patriotic feeling people will not resist oppression, invasion or dispossession by others.</p>
<p>A line must be drawn between Americans and the hyphenated pseudo-Americans. By calling themselves &#8220;African Americans&#8221;, blacks are actually doing you a favour. They have no idea what &#8220;African&#8221; actually means but they must be encouraged in pursuing a distinct identity to yours.</p>
<p>A lot of people here refer to the West and Western culture that is decidedly under threat. Pat Buchanan, Samuel Huntington and others have written about that. So have Pim Fortuyn and Martin Bosma of the Dutch Freedom Party and other European authors.</p>
<p>I think we must work on a renewal of our Western/European identity as a kind of &#8220;metadiscourse&#8221; uniting us all, but then also focus on what makes us local, tribal, members of families and geographical groups. The states in America have wonderful histories that are still recollected, but could be embraced even more, like Europeans also rediscover their ancient roots in the pricipalities, duchies, and so on.</p>
<p>The pressure is on all of us to reinvent ourselves, while reaffirming our roots and ancient heritage.</p>

===</p>
<p>A most important point.   Consider the history taught the Founding Fathers. According to two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough:</p>
<p>&#8220;They [the Founders] were steeped in, soaked in, marinated in, the classics: Greek and Roman history, Greek and Roman ideas, Greek and Roman ideals. It was their model, their example. And they saw themselves very much like the Greeks and the Romans, as actors on a great stage in one of the great historic dramas of all time&hellip;.&#8221; (2002 speech, Depauw University).</p>
<p>Compare to their history instruction to what is taught to white pupils in American public schools. Perhaps the nation&rsquo;s foremost education historian, NYU research professor Diane Ravitch, encapsulates current realities best. In The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003), for example, Ravitch describes the comically elaborate &#8220;bias and sensitivity guidelines&#8221; textbook publishers must use to screen content if they hope to market their textbooks to state textbook adoption committees. In the example below Ravitch is referring to the bias guidelines of textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The MH guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history . . .&rdquo; (p. 44)</p>
<p>McGraw-Hill has no animosity towards the children of European-American ancestry. It wants to sell textbooks. McGraw-Hill and the other publishing giants produce what state textbook adoption committees want. Such guidelines produce content that earns McGraw-Hill credibility with the array of pressure groups who, in hyper-sensitive 21st century America, exercise an effective veto over textbook sales.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-148005" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The simple answer is that most of the nations of continental Europe have  parliamentary systems of government in which poltical representation is apportioned according to the percentage of vote garnered by any political party (ie &#8216;proportional representation&rsquo;).<br/>
The USA and Britain operate systems have &#8216;winner takes all&rsquo; systems in which the party having a plurality of votes cast gets everything, and the smaller parties (even if the nationwide aggregate of their votes amounts substantially, to total more than a combination of seats), get nothing.<br/>
The upshot is that in both Britain and the USa a two-party duopoly exists, in which policy is &#8216;stitched-up&rsquo; between the duopoly. Because &#8216;nice&rsquo; people don&rsquo;t discuss &#8216;race&rsquo;, immigration policy is stitched-up as their is a cozy agreement between the duopoly scarcely to mention it, yet alone do anything about it.<br/>
 In coninental Europe, the issue is forced on the table, and the elitists cannot weasel out of it, whether they like it or not - their careers hinge upon it, and the only thing a politician values more than being &#8216;nice&rsquo; about &#8216;race&rsquo; is his career.</p>

<p>This was to prevent any one party or duopoly of &#8220;like minded&#8221; parties gaining complete control.  This also guaranteed that every vote truly counted and people were allowed to vote for what they really wanted, for representatives that truly reflected the wants of the individual voters.  </p>
<p>A system based on voting for the &#8220;less of two evils&#8221; and tactical voting was eliminated in theory.  How many times have you wanted to vote for a fringe party and stopped yourself because your vote would be &#8220;wasted&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Look up proportional representation and the reality and reasoning behind it, in addition to Germany New Zealand also uses this model. </p>

<p>The thing is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter that Jews and Asians have higher IQs or commit less crimes than Whites. They have a culture all their own and their own way of running things just like Whites do. </p>
<p>Whites literally have no homeland anymore. It&rsquo;s being taken over by people who have homelands already. </p>
<p>If White people had a homeland I would move there. Since I don&rsquo;t, I have to make my last stand right here. I don&rsquo;t want to live in a place that reflects Asian, Black, Arab, Jewish or Hispanic culture. I want to live in a place that reflects White culture. </p>

IQ, crime-rates, VD rates, and partisan politics are not the issue. The biological and cultural fabric of the Westernmost outpost of the most glorious civizilation in human history is. If this assertion sounds chauvinistic, it is. We fast approach the terminal point of polite discourse. &#8220;Influx of black immigrants?&#8221; Where do you live? I would seriously like to relocate, but my Aryan instincts tell me that running is cowardly and futile. See ya in Seoul!<br/>
Oh and please document your claim that &#8220;Asians&#8221; (this term is horribly imprecise and I wouldn&rsquo;t accept it from an undergrad) stand up to blacks. Mestizos may, but most mestizos carry a great deal of sub-saharan DNA, thus explaining their propensity for tribal warfare with blacks in LA, Chicago, etc. But asiatics? Please clarify, where, when and how they represent a new vanguard against the Kaffir.<br/>
Oh and to Alexander, Prost! Nordic blood is priceless! I will drop out of grad school before negelecting my young, Nordic family! Let us all strive for at least 3 per couple!</p>

When Yugoslavia collapsed, several ethnic conflicts that were raging for centuries flared up again. Do you have any idea that when the Soviet Union collapased, 200 different armed ethnic conflicts started? Some of them are raging today, what do you call the Beslan Massacre, the Moscow Theatre incident and many other attacks against ethnic Russians? I call them acts of war against Russia on the part of mostly Muslim ethnics such as the Chechens, which are a bunch of brigands, terrorists and criminals. Hispanics can be just as violent and merciless as they are. Imagine what is going to happen here in a country where many people have five, ten, even dozens of guns and the skills to make and use all sorts of explosives, booby traps and high tech weapons when the U.S. collapses. You are going to find out just have ruthless whites can be when we are fighting for our own homeland, which the Asians are also stealing from us just like the Hispanics and other unwanted immigrants are. All have homelands of their own already, they are taking ours so they can breed more of themselves and attempt to kill us off. We rose up and smashed enemies before when we have been written off as weak and ineffectual, we will do it again. When the white man starts to hate, it always leads to piles of his enemies being left dead and dismembered across the landscape. We are going to revert to Vlad the Impaler, who solved lots of problems with blunt, greased stakes.</p>

It is estimated that there are between 6 million and 10 million illegal black immigrants in South Africa from north of the Limpopo River. We know that almost 1/2 [3m] of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s population is there.<br/>
The reason they choose SA?<br/>
It is easier to get to than crossing the Sahara Desert and Mediterranean Sea to get into Europe. At the border they just have to bribe a border &#8220;guard&#8221; and they are in.<br/>
South Africa is the most developed economy on the continent. 5m whites created a standard of living and quality of life comparable with the USA although it is only about 1/8th the size of the USA.<br/>
Black South Africans do not welcome these invading foreign blacks as they take the scarce number of jobs [created by the white man] on offer. They resort to &#8220;Xenophobic Killings&#8221; to make their point and get rid of the intruders. On a Youtube clip you will find a foreign black referring to SA blacks as the most &#8220;racist&#8221; people on earth.</p>
<p>And please understand this: foreign blacks are NOT &#8220;refugees&#8221; or &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221;<br/>
They are illegal immigrants and economic migrants.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve ever met a white person in real life who truly cared about his or her people. Even the most conservative people I&rsquo;ve met are only concerned about mass immigration because they feel it threatens economic libertarianism. If only non-whites could be converted to their economic views they would be happy to hand over their country and women to them. Similarly I think that most people are attracted to sites like American Renaissance because they think that non-whites drag down the economy or increase crime not because of any true affinity for other white people.</p>

Even those who do think about being a white person, or of the white race, in the modern liberal age wouldn&rsquo;t dare utter that to even their closest friend or family member. There are people who would literally divorce someone they have been married to for a long long time if the spouse ever admitted being a concerned white interested in &#8220;saving&#8221; the white race. The entire topic is literally off the table, and cannot be broached in almost any situation or place, except of course to mock those who think that way or make some point about how other races are all allowed to think that way but not whites. Loss of spouse, loss of job, loss of friends, are all bigger concerns for most people than spitting in the ocean and admitting knowledge of and concern about the problem of the loss of the white race. </p>

<p>A Detroit working-class skinhead with beautiful Nordic children here. I&rsquo;m not worried about anything but the continuous flow of our people&rsquo;s unique, ancient blood. This Republic belongs to us, and it is better cared for in White poverty than (temporary) cosmopolitam prosperity. The consensus is that we will recover from whatever economic quagmire the financial cliff leaves us in, so long as our racial stock remains dinstinct and intact. <br/>
I agree, although there are some country club types on this site who distrust masculine, possibly tattooed co-racialisists, but along with other alt-right websites, this remains better than crippling silence. F it, make &#8216;em uncomfortable, White racial pride is the last tabboo in this dying country.</p>
<p>All the best, H8.</p>

<p>Whites move to escape black crime and social improprieties only to be followed. So they move again. Eventually, whites run out of places to move. </p>
<p>• Europeans constitute world civilization&rsquo;s innovative class.</p>
<p>Most everything from the light bulb, to the computer, to the combustible engine, to medical advances is the product of Western culture. Where would the world be without white ingenuity? Where will it be when that innovation is gone?</p>
<p>• Western civilization provides the civilization&rsquo;s infrastructure. </p>
<p>There are some who actually want to destroy civilization. They view technology as an affront to social justice and their misguided  environmentalist concerns. </p>
<p>It is shot-sighted to allow these people to destroy the infrastructure of civilization. When the Europsphere succumbs to balkanization, that infrastructure will fall plunging the world into a new Dark Ages that will almost certainly include mass starvation. While the self-sufficient East Asians may survive, other people of color will suffer the most. </p>
<p>• White people are altruistically neurotic. </p>
<p>White people respond to TV ads begging for money to support cute little brown and black children in 3rd-world nations. Brown and black people will never send money to help cute little white babies. While supporting these benevolent agencies is admirable, we must be conscious that it is a one-way proposition and secure our ability to continue to offer our support. </p>
<p>• We are experiencing a cultural shake down.</p>
<p>Imagine black thugs robbing a old white man at an ATM. Then, superimpose that image over all of Western culture. It&rsquo;s a massive shake down; extracting capital by force of government from white innovators to be redistributed in the form of EBT cards, ObamaPhones and ObamaCare to non whites. And ObamaCare is just that: An effort to force the innovative class to underwrite the health care of blacks. </p>
<p>End of rant. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-147949" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I remember back 20 years or so ago when Jesse Jackson, the then reigning King of the black shakedown industry, bemoaned that more blacks were in prison than in college. Further, he said or implied that whitey was responsible for this, that blacks were being treated unfairly by our white culture.<br/>
This of course was not true in reality, only in Jesse`s, the black`s and of course DWL, disingenuious white liberal, dolt`s mind was this true. This is the preferred black illusion, that blacks are losers because they are persecuted by whites, which further, the white liberal ideology and blacks themselves, protect, defend and support rather than embrace reality.<br/>
Because blacks have a physically smaller, lower IQ cerebrum, they cannot compete with whites in all manner of things in a higher culture, they are incapable. In large measure the black smaller cerebrum and lower IQ is due to their more progenesic neotenous development compared to white`s more hypermorphosic neotenous development.<br/>
However, rather than accept themselves for their nature and embrace their personal responsibility to mature, they prefer to remain immature, substitute an illusion for reality, and embrace their natural propensity for thugism. This natural propensity for thugism is what a bigger body and smaller cerebrum people, who refuse to mature, gravitate to.<br/>
Though all this be true, liberal ideology not only embraces the blacks, but encourages them to remain immature. For this keeps the loser blacks right where they want them, part of the hoi polloi flock, where further, in a fully enfranchised democracy, they can be used as a means to achieve the  end of power.<br/>
Of course you will never catch DWLs walking the walk of the talk they talked. Never will a Cher or a Sean Penn be caught living in a mostly or partly black neighborhood. At most only in neighborhoods with the token black for show, such as a Whoopi Goldberg.<br/>
Because thug blackism will continue to force white flight, why not all, NLW, non-liberal whites, flock to gather together in republican states for a possible future declaration of independence.<br/>
Lastly, it seems obvious to me, and I hope to many others that a mating and therefore mixing of black and white genes will only  make a smaller cerebrum with lower IQ for our white posterity, our white race.<br/>
As Jesus said, &#8220;lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil&#8221;, amen to that friend. Thank you. </p>

So not only is there nearly zero chance the West will stop the anti-white march to oblivion, there is about an equal chance that the expansion of Islam will be stopped, let alone reversed. </p>
<p>So at this point, whites in the West need to just accept that modern liberalism has indeed won, and vanquished Western Civilization. We have lost already and are now merely in the process of going through the motions. It isn&rsquo;t just the academic and media establishments which have brought this about, it is also the churches in the West. So with those three gone, which institutions exactly are going to join with the remnants who might &#8220;care&#8221; to save the West? Answer, there are none. </p>
<p>Those who appreciate what is happening and read articles such as these possibly commenting with bravado that they will grab their gun and defend to the end should appreciate that the government, military and police forces will all be on the side of the non-white minorities and Muslims, &#8220;protecting&#8221; their interests against such threats. In the end the writings and comments of those who see and would like to change this trajectory will provide little more than cold comfort to those in the future who look back and wonder what happened as they struggle to survive in the wasteland that was once the West.</p>

<p>1. End all foreign aid.<br/>
2. End all foreign military aid.<br/>
3. End welfare as much as possible.<br/>
4. Shrink government.<br/>
5. End affirmative action<br/>
6. End all immigration<br/>
7.  Deport all illegals.<br/>
8. Cancel all H1 visas and work permits and send them packing home.<br/>
9. End all foreign subsidies and raise tariff walls to make goods made here cheaper for us than foreign ones.<br/>
10.  Eliminate those parts of the federal government that are beyond the scope of the constitution like dept. of Ed, etc<br/>
11. Lower taxes across the board.<br/>
12. Make English our official language.<br/>
13.  Cut Puerto Rico loose - full independence.<br/>
14.  Send all foreign &#8216;refugees&rsquo; back (with $$$ to help them LOL) and don&rsquo;t bring in any more.<br/>
15.  Send Americans to JAIL for employing illegals and confiscate their assests.<br/>
16.  Complete the border fence and deploy the military on the southern border.<br/>
17.  DECREASE any welfare or assistance payments for every extra child a welfare momma has (rather then increase as has always been done) and require sterilization after 2 kids if they still want welfare.<br/>
18. Require schools to root out any and all subversive, anti-white and anti-American curriculums in the schools nationwide.<br/>
19.  Revoke citizenship for children who have at least one illegal immigrant parent - and deport.<br/>
20.  Close nearly all foreign military bases all over the world.  (Why do we have 39 bases in japan, for example)<br/>
21.  Stop meddling in foreign affairs.  Who cares if china and japan quibble or fight over specks of islands over there, or if india or pakistan fight or sudan and south sudan fight etc.  We must STOP being the world&rsquo;s policeman.<br/>
22.  End all legal immigration except for love marriages (check for veracity).  End all chain migration.<br/>
23.  End foreign entanglements and treaties that could drag us into wars we don&rsquo;t want, like George Washington warned against.  Why do we need to tie our destiny to japan, israel, ukraine or any other place?  Friendly relations, but no military or defense ties with any nation outside the English speaking world.</p>
<p>This is my ideal platform.  This is how I test all candidates for elective office.  &#8216;Nuff said.  America first.</p>

rise of racism gloat that white racists are an insignificant group, a<br/>

<p>South Africans lost their country through suicide. They believed the same nonsense that many White Americans believed when Barack Obama was elected in 2008. Share power, placate to the non-Whites, and peace will be at hand.</p>
<p>We already have Affirmative Action and racial preferences not only in higher education, but also within the federal government and private employers. Just look at how Blacks are exceptionally overrepresented in the Post Office, the symbol of the failed, bloated, bureaucratic apparatus that is the US government.</p>
<p>In places where Whites have already ceased to be a majority, we have already seen economic collapse, continued racial preferences for non-Whites, and redistribution of wealth from Whites.  Take a look at Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Baltimore.</p>
<p>The only reprieve we might have is that the US is a far more extensive country than South Africa, and therefore there might be more areas to flee to until complete Africanization occurs.</p>

Turning into Latin America is a nightmare, but it is not complete destruction. The real Mexico has a much lower birthrate than the past. Young couples typically have two children. They do have a middle class, freeways and skyscrapers. It is however extermely dangerous because of drug cartels and other criminal presence. Hispanics are more white friendly than blacks. That is cold comfort, but the difference is noticeable. Some hispanic people even pass as white. For years I lived in Los Angeles. I had to live and work in many Hispanic dominated areas, which is most of the city. Driving was treacherous, but walking around was fine. I didn&rsquo;t experience any violence or threatening situations. I would not DARE walk around in a black neighborhood in LA or anywhere. Most black neighborhoods in LA are gone now. They have been gentrified by Mexicans. </p>
<p>We are still 72 percent of the population. We still have a chance to turn this around. If we collectively stand by and do nothing, this is our future. </p>

A feel that Whites are becoming more and more aware of the racial hatred being projected by Black. A liberal friend in Florida was discussing a High School  in Palm Beach Country that she described as &#8220;iffy&#8221; to which I replied &#8221; DO you mean that there are lots of Blacks?&rsquo; Her response was &#8221; Weeell, I didn&rsquo;t really want to put it that way&#8221;.  These people need to get over the bogus guilt that&rsquo;s been instilled in them since the mid 60s. Once they realize that they are in no way responsible for the deplorable situation of race relations and that most of Blacks&rsquo; problems are self inflicted they ( Whites) will feel stirrings of their survival instinct. We are STILL the majority. Four more years of this Admin. should be enough to fire up their fighting spirit.</p>

There is a joke among white South Africans that they would rather be murdered in their own beds than make them.<br/>
The same is happening in Europe and the US. It isn&rsquo;t the fact that whites are unprepared to do dirty and dangerous jobs that results in these jobs being dominated by non whites. It&rsquo;s the fact that whites have a higher general IQ which means that in a multi racial society they are bound to be lifted into white collar professions. If the white dominated society we desire returns it would mean many whites having to give up their cushy middle class lifestyles which is what holds many of them back from endorsing pro white movements.</p>

<p>Most SA whites live in a 1500 to 2000 sq ft single storey house on about 1/4 acre of land.<br/>
Back in the 60s when the cost of living was cheap most whites on a middle class salary employed a live-in black maid and a gardener who commuted to work. Their work load was not onerous and a very easy going benevolent status quo existed. These two domestic employee jobs put  bread on the table for at least another 6 to 8 people given that the homeowners were also feeding their domestic staff and providing free accommodation and health care for their employees.</p>
<p>Visiting Europeans, North Americans and Australians saw Southern African whites as &#8220;lazy&#8221; - but were they really? Besides these entry level jobs into the white cash and industrialised society whites were very paternalistic in teaching blacks the ways of western democratic capitalist society</p>
<p>In those days the ratio of black to white was about 4:1 <br/>
This benevolence has now backfired as the ratio has now soared to 8:1</p>
<p>People like Mandela and Tutu bang on about the &#8220;oppression&#8221; they suffered under white rule. Malema plays the race card even harder and claims that blacks were &#8220;enslaved&#8221; - an absolute lie. The bottom line is that absolutely everything the black man in South Africa is today - from reading, writing, learning English, the clothes he wears, the occupation he has, the brick dwelling he lives in, the car he drives etc - is thanks to the white man.</p>
<p>As the economy grew more and better opportunities became available to them.                          This &#8220;dependence on an overwhelming black workforce&#8221; was a natural evolution of training the local population for few Europeans chose to emigrate to SA. The majority went to North America and Australia. The &#8220;enslavement&#8221; that blacks speak of is from a direct lack of understanding on how a industrialised capitalist society works, for they have never created one anywhere on the planet. Time and motion experts repeatedly told SA industrialists that the productivity of their workforce was abysmal compared to Europe, North America and Asia.</p>
<p>As in Zimbabwe, black South Africans are on a long slow painful learning curve as they discover just how good life really was under white minority they are working so hard at getting rid of.</p>

A newspaper man in New Hampshire was fired because he objected to this forced settlement of Somalis in Lewiston. So much for free speech. During the last election, two Somali women were brought to the polling place by another woman who guided them as to how to vote since they apparently cound not read or write English. The mayor of Lewiston has been attacked by the rabid dogs of the left since he asked the Somalis to become more Americanized and leave the bad aspects of their culture at the door when they come here. Maine has been invaded by left-wingers who constantly screem that Maine is too white and that we need more diversity. Take heed, this will be coming to your town.

They had one of the best militaries in the world, and could have won any civil war. They  only needed to look over to Rhodesia too see what would happen if they gave up power. In my opinion they broke an important principle: Never give yourself over to the mercy of your enemy, especially when you have the upper hand. So why did they do it?  This is my first post. God bless all in Amren.</p>

Thye did a good job at creating a sophisticated alarm network to fight off murderous forays from invading Blacks. However, they recieved great economic pressure from the American media bemoaning the White Boers as Supremists who were mistreating Blacks, even though this was a fullblown lie. American leftists tried to overturn Rhodesia and aided the Blacks in their terrorism against White South Africans. Eventually, the Whites had to surrender their power which was overturned due to fierce economic pressure. The Whites were outnumbered 12 to 1. In 1979, Rhodesia, surrendered power to Mugabe and the ANC thinking that the world would appreciate them, but it only led to collective suicide. I suggest you listen to Dr. William Pierce&rsquo;s video on &#8220;A Lesson in Zimbabwe&#8221;.</p>

About 20 years ago I was in conversation with some young American females, they were going to great lengths to convince me because they had Mexican friends how wonderful Mexicans were. I let them have the floor and when they had finished spouting, I cut in and said, look, no matter how friendly you think the Mexicans are towards you, they regard you as nothing more than a Gringo and a Bloody Gringo at that. Well! the room went a very hushed silence. The look of shock and horror on their faces is still with me, I got up and left the room for them to ponder my thoughts. The Election just gone reveals that many White Females voted for the Sepia one, I just wonder if those American Females I spoke to all those years ago voted for the Sepia one?. You can bet they did. It has been said before= a person can not complain who  Mother is but who your President is, is your own Bloody fault.</p>

<p>Example: I was at a conference and most of the whites were the youngish, liberal, metro/hipsterish types.  Multi-culti, diversity and social justice were the topics du jour at every table.  They would try to outdo each other in their devotion to these causes and there wasa lot of emoting about their love for the &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; cultures out there.  One liberal made a comment about how &#8216;whites have no culture&rsquo; and how &#8216;boring&rsquo; white America was.  So I moved into action.</p>
<p>I mentioned a news article I read (in the liberal NYT) about how it was common for immigrants from a certain part of the world to treat women poorly.  The article also mentioned honor killing and all the rest.  The liberals were aghast at the practice and universally condemned those attitudes.</p>
<p>I pointed out that if we respect all cultures, how can we judge those people and what they do?  I used the liberal lingo and emoted about &#8216;imposing&rsquo; our &#8216;priviledge&rsquo; and &#8216;arrogant attitudes on them.&rsquo;  I pointed out how &#8216;we&rsquo; believe that all cultures are equal and that it was not our place to judge others.  The liberals, especially the emotive, effeminate men, were shocked.  They were more against the practices than the two women at the table.  It was funny how they were literally dominating the females out of the conversation.  I could have really had fun, but I thought I should restrain myself.</p>
<p>So the men objected to every liberal angle I brought up, and the final proclomation of the most dominant one was that &#8216;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they (the immigrant group) thinks, when they come to our country, they have to follow our ways.&rsquo;  The two females nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>I secretly claimed a small victory.  A seed was planted.</p>
<p>All you need to do is use their liberalism against them.  </p>

In Ivory Coast english-speaking whites of every hue are welcomed, to replace the French that are detested.  Even in South Africa, those Afrikaners should claim themselves of the Spartan model of micro-society, they will end up rapidly in high demand as security guards among others.  In all societies of all colours, Aryans have always be appreciated for their aloofness and intellectual detachment in difficult military situations, which in any Black-led society cannot but multiply.  What always brings the White man&rsquo;s demise is not the presence or even the majority or the rule of Blacks or Browns, but the Athenian (and late Alexandrian Jewish) way of education based on the over-intellectual ideal of leisure class as highest human condition of all, it brings the White man&rsquo;s demise and shame even in the absence of Negroes and other turds, just look present-day Greece.  What brought the Afrikaners&rsquo; demise was their own enjoying their superiority as a leisure class instead of pursuing the way of life of the Grand Trek.  All aristocracies that turn into leisure class and Athenian ideals of superiority are about to lose cruelly, witness the French Revolution where my own ancestors were reduced by brown peasants to the relative poverty we are still experiencing, except for those who resumed military and adventure life.  Afrikaner whites should resume the Trek so to speak and live among the Zulus and the Bantus exactly as a superior tribe respected by others, the Blacks themselves would be progressively enchanted.</p>
<p>As for white Americans, they should first desert universities and be intent on their kid&rsquo;s going to military academies instead.  They should boycott religiously any university or church having taught only once any such thing as the non-importance of race or genes, they should first prefer a poor close-knit racist community as were constituting the original American fabric, to a posher kosher one.</p>

He will be rather recalled as America&rsquo;s Allende, that is to say as its ultimate shame, without a martyrdom&rsquo;s posthumous glory.  He is the terminator of America as a liberal humanistic country, and as in Chile all social sectors marked by that ideology will fall into shanty towns of their own.  He will be remembered as the ultimate Black man in power that finalized America&rsquo;s decline before its transformation into something very different, may be several countries at war with each other for good as older Europe used to be at the apex of her glory.   Black men will never be elected again at any position of power.  Even if American is to go on as more and more multi-cultural entity, like ancient India or 20th century Brazil, all cultures therein will agree upon keeping the Black man at his ultimate lower rank.  The newer non-Negro communities that come in were born outside the late Western humanistic paradigm and make no qualms about finding Blacks animalistic, even many Black communities themselves.  Those foreign ethnic groups, like for instance very dark Indians, maintain a White Aryan beauty ideal or fantasy that many Whites themselves have been led to forget.  Latinos don&rsquo;t fall for liberal thought any longer, except for purely short-term opportunistic goals, those who fall outside the Catholic church&rsquo;s purview generally become Evangelists dreaming of an Aryan-led society (even when they are zionists).  Obama&rsquo;s utter failure will impact even the heirs of Mandala in SA.</p>

It&rsquo;s clear the objective is to keep the white birth rate down, the nuclear family under stress.   Everyone thinks immigration is destroying our race but it is also antenatal, as opposed to pro-natal push of the liberal left.  </p>

In any social phenomen you can NEVER EVER compete with someone who are giving away stuff for free. (Maybe in Switzerland it will not work because these clever  people will immediately realize that their own things will be given away). But everywhere else in the world it is a simple recipe - promise those who do not have much that they will get things for free. Once they have voted you in, you explain to them that the free stuff they where going to get, was unfairly acquired by the affluent and is still being held unfairly by the affluent. Then tell them to keep voting for you and you will change legislation to help them and their kin enter the country and tell them you will introduce legislation to  take the stuff that belongs to the affluent and give it to the &#8216;previously disadvantaged&rsquo;  (who incidentally bred themselves into the disadvantaged position) but who are a very rich source of votes by now.</p>

Which, in case you&rsquo;re wondering, is the destruction of western society, western culture and western morals, which is what made western society the greatest in human history.</p>
<p>For so many decades White South Africa was scoffed as being evil, racist and backward for our policies and beliefs.  None of those white leftists who were so vehemently against us in every way, took a minute to consider (or to do any thinking at all) that maybe a thing like Apartheid was in place not because we were morally depraved, but was in place for a very specific reason.  And I think that reason is now so clearly visible to white people throughout the rest of the western world.</p>
<p>But I dont think that as a civilisation, us westerners (white people) are going to end up in a permanent state of decline, we are a too resilient people.  Evidence of which is visible in SA today.  Ultimately the only political choice white people will have one day, is the choice that Germans made in the 1930s.  Yes that is a frightening thought.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-280059" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One thing that I find very interesting is that whenever I encounter SA expats (refugees) they simply will not discuss why they left or anything about race relations. Here is my interpretation: I have only met anglo or Jewish refugees, who were the liberals pre-ANC. I&rsquo;ve never met a Boer. The anglophone liberals cannot admit that they were wrong; hence emigration and that peculiar reticence. They are still liberals, even after being mugged by reality. Some truths just do not compute.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-349411" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wow, this is a fairly racist group of comments!  The most obvious are the ones commenting about black children being adopted by white wealthy parents and still ending up in prison&hellip;which is patently false.  Black (and Hispanic) children adopted and raised by white children perform almost at the same level educationally and with outcomes as white children.  </p>
<p>South Africa is also not preventing white people from ANYTHING.  It is trying to right the wrongs from the apartheid era where blacks WERE prevented from having access to almost anything in the country, including even living in certain districts.  That has changed, and that is naturally for the better.</p>
<p>As a white Republican business owner who voted twice for President Obama, I find the assumptions that only blacks/Hispanics allowed the President to win to be entertaining.  That might be true in red, conservative states where racism runs rampant in the white communities, but that is less true in the blue more progressive states where racism is less common or severe and where racial diversity has been encouraged for a much longer time.  More white people voted for Romney and McCain-that is true.  But plenty of white people (over a third, in fact) did vote for Obama.  And the income level and education of that third of white voters was the highest of white groups.  So the wealthier and more educated you were as a white voter, the more likely you were to vote for President Obama.  </p>
<p>As usual, the typical anti-Obama and pro-white rhetoric comes from people of less educated backgrounds-who have grown up with less educated and less tolerant surroundings to know any better-or people with less economic means-who often blame &#8220;the others&#8221; for their perceived lot in life.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-448071" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The actual issue is more deep than mere skin colour. The English as well as the dutch speakers belong to a different social structure. The African/Asians and also certain White Continental Europeans belong to feudal language based social structure.</p>
<p>In feudal language social structures, social communication is quite barbarian, brutal, beastly and more or less akin to carnivorous animal-like. However, people who live in English nations and speak native-English cannot understand the tremendous difference that exists among different living beings, including those who are collectively called human beings. They see other living beings, also called human beings, as equal to them in intellectual and other dispositions, because they see them only on the platform of a planar language known as English. The fact is that there is no concept of human equality outside the domains of planar languages like English. </p>
<p>As to the native English and Afrikaners in South Africa, they are in a very desperate situation, in which they are slowly getting embedded into a brutal social pattern and arrangement. Once they get fully embedded inside this satanic arrangement, they will be no different from the others in the brutal social system. Actually their refinements and politeness etc. will turn out to be their weakness, in a social system and communication wherein politeness has no value. </p>
<p>The US is fully compromised and no help can be expected from that quarters. In fact, the US is slowly becoming an Asian/African nation, with all the feudal features therein. It is a very dangerous situation in which the tremendous powers of technology will be in the hands of persons least fit to manage them. For they will all be powerfully connected to the interior social leaderships of Asian/African feudal households. </p>
<p>GB went mad with the coming to power of the super-nut Clement Atlee.  There is no feeling for &#8216;England&rsquo; or even to the term &#8216;Great Britian&rsquo;. It is now a nonsensical entity that promotes an historically inept concept called &#8216;United Kingdom&rsquo;.  Everything that the formally uneducated high quality Englishmen achieved all around the world, to create the English Empire, was thrown to the rats by Clement Atlee and the idiot, formally highly educated academicians. </p>
<p>The South African Whites belong to a highly refined population that imparted quality to the social apparatus and at the same time, stood apart from the dirtiness all around. The blacks would have improved, if they had not listened to crooks like the Mandela who literally belong to the native feudal classes that had held sway over them for centuries. In fact, blacks being under the feudal upper class blacks is going to be another historical tragedy. </p>
<p>If someone with money and power could bring help to the South African White to move them en-mass to some other location in the world, it would certainly be an act the gods would bless.</p>
