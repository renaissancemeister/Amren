<h1 class="title">Third Party Options for Whites</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Peter Bradley, American Renaissance, November 27, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
The future doesn't look bright.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Most of the talk among conservatives the last few weeks has been about how Republicans can attract Hispanics. Now that even the likes of Sean Hannity and Rand Paul support amnesty, it seems Congress will give it a try.</p>
<p>As if on cue, Senators Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer announced that they were resuming their bipartisan discussions on a &ldquo;pathway to citizenship.&rdquo; Senator Graham says that Hispanics are &ldquo;the fastest-growing demographic in the country and we&rsquo;re losing votes every election cycle; it has to stop. It&rsquo;s one thing to shoot yourself in the foot &mdash; just don&rsquo;t reload the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, by adding millions of instant Democrats to the voter rolls the GOP would be once again taking aim at its own foot.</p>
<p>George Will offers the startling insight that these lawbreakers and line jumpers are actually entrepreneurs just salivating at the chance to vote Republican:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most voters already favor less punitive immigration policies than the ones angrily advocated by clenched-fist Republicans unwilling to acknowledge that immigrating &mdash; risking uncertainty for personal and family betterment &mdash; is an entrepreneurial act.</p></blockquote>
<p>Guests on the Sunday talk shows almost universally agree that the Republicans lost because they pander to &ldquo;angry white men.&rdquo; It is an odd sort of pandering that promotes more legal immigration with a few throwaway lines about securing the border, and includes tacit support for &ldquo;affirmative action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just liberals who mock &ldquo;white men.&rdquo; Al Cardenas, the Hispanic head of the American Conservative Union complains that his party is &ldquo;too old and too white and too male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the GOP apparently tracking left, white voters are, more than ever, without a political home. If there was ever a moment for a third party it would seem to be now. Unfortunately, no third party now shows much promise.</p>
<p>For 20 years, the <a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com/">Constitution Party</a> (CP) has tried to establish itself as a paleoconservative political force. If nothing else, it gave thousands of voters something to vote <em>for</em> in the last five elections. However it had its best performance with 199,880 votes back in 2008, when it was on the ballot in 37 states. This year, the party was on the ballot in only 26 states, and got only118,000 votes. Write-ins have yet to be included, but it seems the party will fall far short of its performance in the previous election.</p>
<p>This is particularly disappointing because this year&rsquo;s CP candidate was former Virginia Congressman Virgil Goode. In the past, the party focused mainly on abortion, but this year its main issue was immigration. Mr. Goode even called for reduced <em>legal</em> immigration.</p>
<div id="attachment_102172" style="width: 548px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/VirgilGoode.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102172" title="VirgilGoode" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/VirgilGoode.jpg" width="538" height="350"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Virgil Goode</p></div>
<p>Part of the problem was that the GOP spent lots of money to keep the CP off the ballot in key states such as Pennsylvania, because Republicans feared Mr. Goode would take votes from Mr. Romney. Another problem was internal bickering. The American Independence Party in California stopped being the Golden State&rsquo;s CP affiliate in 2010, and that cost the party thousands of votes in the most populous state. The CP has certainly not offered enough of a threat to the GOP to stop its leftward drift on issues such as quotas and amnesty.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</a> had its best showing ever, winning over a million votes for the first time. It managed to get on the ballot in 48 states, and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson earned over 3.5 percent of the vote in his home state. The GOP tried hard to keep the Libertarians off the ballot as well. Libertarians promote small government and free markets, which appeals to paleoconservatives, but their position on immigration is terrible.</p>
<div id="attachment_102173" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GaryJohnson.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102173" title="GaryJohnson" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/GaryJohnson.jpg" width="425" height="283"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gary Johnson</p></div>
<p>Where could a viable third party option for whites come from?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://american3rdposition.com/">American Third Position</a> (A3P) ran on an explicitly pro-white platform. A3P candidate Merlin Miller was on the ballot in three states and won 12,895 votes (with write-ins still to be added). This was A3P&rsquo;s first national election, but the party will have to do a lot more if it is to become a home for disaffected white voters.</p>
<div id="attachment_102174" style="width: 561px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MerlinMiller.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102174 " title="MerlinMiller" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MerlinMiller.jpg" width="551" height="338"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Merlin Miller</p></div>
<p>One possibility is the Tea Party movement. While it mostly focuses on economic and budget issues, the group is composed almost entirely of whites who are alarmed by the direction their nation has taken. The Republicans were happy to take their votes but now party elites such as strategist Steve Schmidt are blaming them for the GOP woes, and arguing that they must be muzzled.</p>
<p>Tea Partier Herman Cain has now hinted at a third-party run:</p>
<blockquote><p>I never thought that I would say this, and this is the first time publicly that I&rsquo;ve said it: We need a third party to save this country. Not Ron Paul and the Ron Paulites. No. We need a legitimate third party to challenge the current system that we have, because I don&rsquo;t believe that the Republican Party &mdash; although I ran as a Republican, I have been voting Republican for decades &mdash; has the ability to rebrand itself against the mainstream media machine that blatantly works to support this president and other liberals, and works, blatantly, to tarnish the brand of what the Republican party stands for.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Cain is hardly the ideal candidate for alienated whites, but at least he is solid on immigration, and could give GOP leaders pause if he threatens to help organize a third party in response to another amnesty push.</p>
<div id="attachment_102175" style="width: 532px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/HermanCain.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-102175 " title="HermanCain" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/HermanCain.jpg" width="522" height="347"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Herman Cain</p></div>
<p>Blogger Half Sigma argues that the GOP should give up on the abortion issue while fighting against amnesty. That is what I call the Pete Wilson strategy: speaking up for whites on the National Question, while ignoring or taking a libertarian stance on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Half Sigma predicts the GOP will do the opposite.</p>
<p>But could the Pete Wilson strategy become the basis for a third party? Unfortunately, I can think of no leader or politician of either party who is both pro-choice and sound on the National Question.</p>
<p>Still, there is a lot of dissatisfaction with Republicans and conservatives. Many whites are looking for someone to speak for them. Perhaps the Republicans&rsquo; suicidal push for amnesty will help spur a third party that stands up for white Americans for a change.</p>
<p>As for Republicans, they seem to be going the way of the Whigs.</p>

We don&rsquo;t need people like you in our movement!&#8221; It doesn&rsquo;t occur to them that part of being a libertarian/small government means the government shouldn&rsquo;t be telling individuals or businesses who they have to do business with or who to associate with. Also, many of the libertarians are in favor of open borders. &#8220;We have a right to live anywhere we want&#8221; they will proclaim. The only area I for sure agree with libertarians on is ending foreign aide and getting our military back home. I also agree with them that-while I personally don&rsquo;t use illegal drugs and never have and never will-that the &#8216;war on drugs&rsquo; is a waste of money and resources arresting, jailing and prosecuting the people who sell and use them. Other than that, they are wrong on immigration and on racial issues.</p>

<p>As a person who has been a libertarian for a long time, it pains me how much egalitarianism and political correctness has crept into the party. The ideological creep was clearly demonstrated in the last presidential election. Ron Paul was denounced as racist for some statements that were attributed to him from a libertarian publication published a few decades ago. While those statements might be considered racist today, they were mainstream libertarian ideology a few decades ago. Today, it seems that many libertarians have forgotten why a third party was formed. That was because the libertarians opposed the civil rights act and the war on poverty just as much as they opposed the war on drugs.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-156838" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;Look at what happened to the good-intentioned Reagan amnesty in 1986. With a smiling Teddy Kennedy in the background, Reagan signed an amesty. That signing was conditional: the Border be closed. The closing of the Border never happened - as the democrats knew never would. All it really did was an alarming increase in border-hoppers that escalated into a full-blown invasion the democrats knew would happen.. and increase their voter &#8220;base&#8221;. We witnessed what the result that was in the recent re-relection of the most dangerous imposter(Kenyan) to ever sit in the White House. </p>
<p>As my sister and brother-in-law witnessed election night, the children of those invaders &#8220;kicked in&#8221; on election night once their children got to voting age. They were naturalized citizens and &#8220;achor babies&#8221; thanks to an antiquated law that should have been eliminated years ago. We watched - incredibly - how recently former red states like Colorado and Nevada went from red to BLUE. How else could America have RE-elected a communist and probable America-hating muslim? Newly birthed hispanic voters made the difference. The big-eared Black marxist would NEVER have been re-elected a mere 10 yrs. ago. Obviously the democrats knew that this insane amnesty and ignoring of the Southern border would have telling effects in a short time;.it took a little more than a couple of decades to it to take effect on our nation. </p>
<p>We have now reached the point of no return and the breakup of America will occur sooner than I predicted more than 20 years ago - largely along racial lines. Whites will simply not put up with the danger and lawlessness that the newcomers will no doubt bring. </p>
<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news - like the readers of AmRen weren&rsquo;t aware of it!. But we can still survive if we enforce our borders, the rule of law and the strengthening of our commitment to our sovereignty. Unless that is happens, we will become a nation like Brazil, or worse.</p>

Welfare cheques should have requirements for more than just looking for work, they should be required to be using contraceptives during that time so that the cycle of poverty is broken. I suggest that before granting them their welfare handout they should be required to receive a contraceptive injection to last 3 months and the benefit to be reapplied for every 3 months with another injection required. Ideally an injection that lasts 6 months would be better as it would keep costs down.</p>

I would only add that we are all human livestock in the eyes of the owner&rsquo;s of the world&rsquo;s central banks. We exist only to consume and reproduce more shoppers. Blacks, Browns, and those of the lowest intelligence disproportionately consume and reproduce to the greatest degree, by far.<br/>
The usefulness of conservatives Whites to the owners of the world&rsquo;s central bank is financing the lives and procreation of Blacks and Browns. They and their descendants will take every penny redistributed to them (from us) and give it immediately back to the owner&rsquo;s of the world&rsquo;s central banks, with interest, penalties, and fees. We no longer have sufficient numbers to stop them, politically.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much deeper and consequential than that. I am thinking of things like the development and use of LSD by first the OSS in WW2 and later the CIAs programs. Later on, they actually became involved in profiting from heroin smuggling during the Vietnam war. By the 80s, it was un-official fund raising via cocaine trafficking. Then, there is the lies, corruptions and arrogance that led to the various conflicts beginning with the Vietnam war. </p>
<p>The truth is that no one side is all right (and righteous) or all wrong (and evil). It takes human greed, arrogance and idiocy to do the job. Just as the Republican party is showing itself as a good old, Bible quoting prostitute, the pimp is the almighty dollar and of course, power.</p>

The GOP could lock up elections if they&rsquo;d start representing middle America.

Did the GOP really think middle America would stick with them if their party is working to beggar their children?<br/>
Reform Wall Street. Let the GOP do it and steal the democrat party&rsquo;s thunder. It&rsquo;s got to be done. Or would they rather offend 20 billionaires than millions of American voters?<br/>
Do NOT pander to illegal aliens. Frame the immigration issue for what it is: A matter of fairness. It isn&rsquo;t right to reward someone who snuck into the country illegally while making those who want to come through the front door wait. It isn&rsquo;t right to demand austerity from people whose families paid taxes to the government for generations while giving away taxpayer-funded gifts to illegal aliens.<br/>
If they stick to principle and fight hard, the GOP has a chance of turning its fortunes around. If they sell out, become the democrat-lite party and support amnesty, they&rsquo;ll never win another national election. Count on it.</p>

<p>Yes because keeping gays from getting married and keeping women from having abortions is so much more important than saving the White race and America. </p>
<p>Hey guys we totally need to save the White race! Oh and by the way we need to stop those stupid homos from getting married and stop those sinning women from having abortions! YAY!</p>

<p>Actually, those were two of the issues that would&rsquo;ve have made the GOP the majority, if they had had the sense to keep immigration under control. Gays and people who have abortions tend not to have a lot of children. Alas, the GOP managed to pull defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>

Also, until alternate sources of funding can be found, nothing will happen. The three biggest donors in the last election were Jewish billionaires- Sheldon Anderson raised 34 mil for Romney, followed by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Irwin Jacobs to Obama (about 5 million). Does anyone think that Jewish money will soon start flowing into pro-white 3rd parties? And who in their right mind wants Herman &#8220;999&#8243; Cain as their 3rd party president?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155371" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I found it hard to get past &#8220;immigrating&hellip; is an entrepreneurial act.&#8221; I&rsquo;m afraid George Will&rsquo;s definition of entrepreneurial act is so fast and loose as to have no real meaning. By that reckoning, a ghetto street mugger in Detroit is an entrepreneur (and is therefore a natural Republican, per Will), because he is &#8220;risking uncertainty for personal betterment.&#8221; Right&hellip;.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m afraid that the deck is intentionally stacked against third parties, and that deck is VERY high. From what I understand, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to even get a third party candidate on a state ballot (even for the &#8220;common&#8221; third parties), and that has to be done for a critical mass of states to have any real meaning. Furthermore, candidates have to reach a 15% threshold in the national polls to participate in the national debates, and they have to compete in fundraising against rent-seeking moneyed interests on Wall Street.</p>
<p>All this, of course, presupposes that a third-party, pro-White president could even get anything done. I&rsquo;m assuming that there would have to be some sort of down-ballot groundswell in ideologically similar third-party candidates in Congress and the various state-houses and Governors&rsquo; mansions for true change to take effect. </p>
<p>Conclusion: abandoning the political process and engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is the more viable alternative at this point, even though the odds may only change from 1 in 1,000,000 to 1 in 800,000. A pro-White third-party that can GET SOMETHING DONE is a pipe dream.</p>

The question is whether it can be taken over by people with at least implicitly pro-white interests, such as immigration control/enforcement, trade balance, cutting out non-elderly welfare, and dismantling affirmative action.<br/>
People like McCain and Graham are always looking for a shot to promote amnesty, but anyone who does any thinking about it will realize that amnesty would make it impossible for the GOP to win a national election for good. What&rsquo;s worse is that the GOP did not pander enough to angry white men, because large numbers of them just did not show up. To me, that&rsquo;s a sign of whites dropping out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to constribute to organizations that promote white people in between elections. I want to make my tax profile as small as possible while promoting white interests. I&rsquo;ve heard of this Northwest Front, and I would like them to set up a bunch of front charities to take contributions on a tax deductible basis while ensuring the benfits go to whites. The Combined Jewish Philanthropies might be a good model. We should also be looking into mutual aid societies, loan societies, and mutual insurance companies that might cater to white people by having otherwise uncompetitive rates. Anyone with ideas or contact information, I would appreciate it.</p>

PULEEZE stop and think about this one. Raise your children to give lip-service to the liberal b.s. in school, but to NOT BELIEVE that crappola! The only way thinking people can fight the liberal multi-culti b.s., is by educating our young and preventing them from absorbing that liberal slop forced into them by teachers and later, professors.</p>

To avoid peer pressure or to avoid being shunned by their more &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; students? This not only sends a somewhat confusing message to them, but it tends to reinforce a submissive attitude and deference to the liberal message. We should teach our young people to speak out against liberalism without necessarily being offensive in speech, attitude or conduct. A good way to approach it is to simply ask very penetrating questions about liberalism without providing an answer. Let the other students or even teachers struggle in trying to answer such questions. It might get them thinking - which is what they are there for in the first place. I think now is the time for conservatives and race-realists to be a little bolder and speak their mind.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155411" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Talk of a third party on the right reminds me of what the left was talking about during and for a few years after 1968. Many thought that if Robert Kennedy had not been assassinated he would have defeated Richard Nixon in the general election. They ignored polls that showed that during the primary Hubert Humphrey was the only Democrat candidate who was ever ahead of Richard Nixon. They also ignored the popularity of George Wallace. </p>
<p>During and after 1968 American liberals and radicals were mainly concerned with the War in Vietnam. Although there was little enthusiasm for the War by 1968 there was less support for a conditional surrender to North Vietnam. That was the only way to end the War.</p>
<p>Most whites in 1968 were more concerned with the rise in crime and the five years of black ghetto riots that happened from 1964 to 1968. When the riots ended abruptly with the election of Richard Nixon most whites noticed. That was why Richard Nixon was rewarded with a landslide victory in 1972.</p>
<p>A Gallup Survey released June 16, 2012 indicated that 66 percent of Americans think that immigration is a good thing, while 29 think it is bad for America.</p>

<p>On the other hand, surveys have indicated majority support for higher taxes on the rich for several years.</p>

<p>Although I am a Democrat I favor more restrictions on immigration. Because I am a Democrat I favor another third party on the right because it would help the Democrats to dominate the United States. </p>
<p>If one feels something strongly it is easy to overestimate the number of people who feel the same way. It is easy to underestimate the difficulty of converting others to one&rsquo;s persuasion.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155891" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>If that&rsquo;s your benchmark, then George Romney really wasn&rsquo;t any more of a job creator than Mitt Romney. George Romney didn&rsquo;t create American Motors out of thin air; American Motors was the result of the 1954 merger between Nash and Hudson, two companies that had been in the American auto production market for some time before that. Romney was merely AMC&rsquo;s second CEO. I suppose his great accomplishment was emphasizing small cars when everyone else in the industry thought that people wanted large cars, and that might have resulted in some marginal job increases for awhile at AMC, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as saying that George Romney was personally responsible for every employment situation that ever existed at AMC.</p>

To each his own Mr. Engelman, but why would you remain in a political party that&rsquo;s so deeply and diametrically opposed to the White race and its future here in America? Aside from your liberal views which are in accord with the Democrat platform, what sense is there in alligning with a political party that longs for the White man&rsquo;s displacement?</p>

<p>I am ambivalent about immigration. I like the cultural diversity immigrants provide. I like ethnic restaurants, ethnic grocery stores, ethnic festivals, and so on. At the same time I recognize that a high rate of immigration contributes to the growing income gap by depressing wages and inflating profits.</p>

The country I grew up in with its White population and influence is disappearing before my very eyes. I can&rsquo;t remain &#8220;ambivalent&#8221; about that!

<p>Since the establishment of the Moral Majority in 1979 I have viewed the religious right with interest and sympathy. I love Christianity in all of its diversity, but I am mainly attracted to the liturgical denominations. </p>
<p>I regret the fact that since the 1950s a smaller percentage of Americans attend church, and a much larger percentage engage in sex outside of marriage. However, in a country like the United States there is little the government can do to influence religious and sexual behavior, so I do not consider these to be political issues.</p>

I know a good number of whites who come from large white families who reject their family religion or who date nonwhites or who choose not to have kids (maybe one or two at the most) or who are liberal. Your kids will often rebel against the values you pressed upon them. In this anti-white, PC society it&rsquo;s not uncommon for white kids who come from very conservative, clean-cut white environments to be distracted and pressured. It breaks my heart when I watch this reality show called Being Amish or whatever seeing those traditional, clean cut young whites acting like modern day thugs.</p>

<p>Now, we all need to place our focus, time and energy on our statewide - AND municipal - politics. If we are to keep what strength we have - and gain more -, it must be on a state-by-state, and city-by-city (school board-by-school board?) basis. Some positive news for this last election was that republican governors saw a net gain in their numbers.</p>

One positive to having a Republican President would be that, if at the state level a Republican governor passes a law like Arizona&rsquo;s, the President would be less likely to sue to overturn the law. It&rsquo;s just party politics for them but would be a victory for those that want more laws like AZ has. A Republican President might be hopeless on immigration but if the &#8220;red&#8221; states pass their own laws and the President let&rsquo;s them stand that would be a victory. Of course after four more years of Obama and his non white newcomers, it probably won&rsquo;t matter even at the state level. Sorry this is so wordy&hellip;</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-body-155485" class="dsq-comment-body">
<div id="dsq-comment-message-155485" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The world is driven exclusively by commerce. The haves work all their lives to sell you stuff. The have-nots work all their lives to buy the stuff. The select few (e.g. the owners of the world&rsquo;s central banks) who print and own the fiat currencies of the world completely control the haves, the have-nots, and the puppet governments. The elite lives of the owners of the world&rsquo;s central banks are fully funded by the flow of capital (commerce). Who benefits them more? Thrifty conservatives like us who save our money, or semi-literate imbeciles who spend money that they don&rsquo;t have and will never have?</p>
<p>All of the political arguments back and forth are clever subterfuge and completely meaningless. Certainly, stark political differences exist among people, but none of it matters in the slightest. Society is being completely reshaped according to the will of the owners of the world&rsquo;s central banks. They want money in the hands of those who will spend it. That generates taxes and interest, which flows back to them.</p>
<p>The reshaping of society is relentlessly toward maximum diversification to ensure that there is absolutely no consensus for anything and that chaos reigns. That leads to a continuation of utter confusion and the continued devolution of civilization. The more chaotic and less intelligent society is, the more zealous commerce is and the tighter the grip of the world&rsquo;s elite on society becomes.</p>
<p>As evidence of the chaos, consider the facts. Everything that was once taboo is now normal or quickly becoming normal. Homosexuality, drugs, gay marriage, incest, pedophilia, illegal immigration, bestiality, radical &#8220;religions&#8221;, etc. </p>
<p>For example, it is now completely normal to accept the fact that Blacks get a free-ride for life in school, society, employment, and every other walk of life. When a Black errs, no one says a word about it due to the innate fear of being called a racist (or being attacked and killed by angry Blacks after pointing out their errors).</p>
<p>In addition, during the election, Obama said the best revenge is to vote for him. Today, SCOTUS Justice Ginsberg said that she would finally be satisfied when the SCOTUS is comprised exclusively of women. She was not joking. So, we know that Obama and Ginsberg deeply resent and loathe White males. They are far from alone.</p>
<p>My friends, this is the type of insane world we live in now. It will become much, much worse as the diversification of ideas continues, and our fellow Whites who own the world&rsquo;s central banks continue their relentless drive to erect a new world of patrons with far lower intelligence, no morality, and the natural inclination to procreate future shoppers a la wild jackal.</p>
<p>If you wonder why nothing is done when young Blacks murder defenseless Whites, the reasons are threefold. First, the White person is dead. He/she can no longer shop. Second, placing the Black male in prison would prevent him from shopping and spending the welfare check that is redistributed to him. Third, while he is incarcerated, he would be unable to sire as many future shoppers as he naturally would if left on the streets.</p>
<p>I fully expect in a few short years to see new bills introduced in Congress and quickly passed into law that directly taxes White males (yes, specifically by race and sex) and redistributes the money to Blacks and illegals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all we do is complain here, rather than organize and begin to develop solutions to withhold our commerce from selected corporations. Why don&rsquo;t we act, my friends?</p>

Of course not. Because you have been deluded by propagandists into believing you&rsquo;re morally superior if you assume the attitude you have. But you&rsquo;re not morally superior. You&rsquo;re duped into a particular mindset.<br/>
You have been tricked and conditioned to feel as if it is good and proper to embrace PC tenets, just as the Nazis were conditioned to accept superiority. It&rsquo;s the same kind of propaganda but just a different frame of reference. Both kinds of propaganda prey on the weak-minded and gullible. Communists were very successful at this.<br/>
Bigotry is refusing to recognize that multiculturalism is as destructive to a country than an invading army. &hellip;..and liking it.<br/>
Your type of bigot today has been prgrammed by the sect leaders of political correctness, just as the citizens of Orwell&rsquo;s Big Brother society were mentally conditioned to accerpt Big Brother and his Orwellian propaganda machine.<br/>
You could no more think in an objective manner than the purveyors of hate on MSNBC or the black talking heads on t.v., Jesse, Al, Farrakhan, Dyson,. et al.<br/>
So, keep in mind that when you stand up, salute the flag and announce how true and pure you are by embracing PC, what you&rsquo;re really doing is broadcasting that you have been programmed like a robot&hellip;&hellip;and you&rsquo;re unable to recognize that your country, its traditions, culture and way of life are being destroyed.</p>

<p>The truth is, that in most respects the US is pretty much an arm of the Knesset. Besides, Israel is now a nuclear power, so they can certainly deal with the situation on their own. The fact that they want us to fight their wars for them shows you their character.</p>

<p>Israel did not consult us on whether it could attack the USS Liberty in the Six-Day War, or suborn Jonathan Pollard to loot our security secrets, or transfer our weapons technology to China. They went ahead and did it, knowing the Americans would swallow hard and take it.&#8221;<br/>

<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last decade, Jonathan Pollard, the American Navy employee who spied for Israel in the mid-nineteen-eighties and is now serving a life sentence, has become a cause celebre in Israel and among Jewish groups in the United States. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a consortium of fifty-five groups, has publicly called for Pollard&rsquo;s release, arguing, in essence, that his crimes did not amount to high treason against the United States, because Israel was then and remains a close ally. Many of the leading religious organizations have also called for an end to Pollard&rsquo;s imprisonment, among them the Reform Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Orthodox Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of officials strongly suspect that the Israelis repackaged much of Pollard&rsquo;s material and provided it to the Soviet Union in exchange for continued Soviet permission for Jews to emigrate to Israel. Other officials go further, and say there was reason to believe that secret information was exchanged for Jews working in highly sensitive positions in the Soviet Union. A significant percentage of Pollard&rsquo;s documents, including some that described the techniques the American Navy used to track Soviet submarines around the world, was of practical importance only to the Soviet Union. One longtime C.I.A. officer who worked as a station chief in the Middle East said he understood that &#8220;certain elements in the Israeli military had used it&#8221;   &mdash;   Pollard&rsquo;s material   &mdash;   &#8220;to trade for people they wanted to get out,&#8221; including Jewish scientists working in missile technology and on nuclear issues. Pollard&rsquo;s spying came at a time when the Israeli government was publicly committed to the free flow of Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union. The officials stressed the fact that they had no hard evidence   &mdash;   no &#8220;smoking gun,&#8221; in the form of a document from an Israeli or a Soviet archive   &mdash;   to demonstrate the link between Pollard, Israel, and the Soviet Union, but they also said that the documents that Pollard had been directed by his Israeli handlers to betray led them to no other conclusion.</p>
<p>High-level suspicions about Israeli-Soviet collusion were expressed as early as December, 1985, a month after Pollard&rsquo;s arrest, when William J. Casey, the late C.I.A. director, who was known for his close ties to the Israeli leadership, stunned one of his station chiefs by suddenly complaining about the Israelis breaking the &#8220;ground rules.&#8221; The issue arose when Casey urged increased monitoring of the Israelis during an otherwise routine visit, I was told by the station chief, who is now retired. &#8220;He asked if I knew anything about the Pollard case,&#8221; the station chief recalled, and he said that Casey had added, &#8220;For your information, the Israelis used Pollard to obtain our attack plan against the U.S.S.R. all of it. The coordinates, the firing locations, the sequences. And for guess who? The Soviets.&#8221; (boldface mine - Ronin)Casey had then explained that the Israelis had traded the Pollard data for Soviet emigres. &#8220;How&rsquo;s that for cheating?&#8221; he had asked.&#8221;</p>

Yeah, Iran&rsquo;s always had such a stellar, world-wide reputation for independent films, art, and freedom of thought. Good Lord, what the heck was he thinking? Oh I&rsquo;m sure they showed all their appreciation with gifts and photo-ops, all the while snickering behind his back at what a useful idiot he was.<br/>
Again, it&rsquo;s been a while since I read his on-line article about his trip to Iran, but he snuggled up a little too close to their crazed Muslim President for my tastes. Yes, he did seem to believe that Iran has a right to its own sovereignty without the meddling of other nations. But that &#8216;meddling&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t occur in a vacuum. It occurred because: (1) Iran had been supporting and funding terrorist activities throughout the globe. (2) Iran took serious steps to develop and build nuclear weapons. (3) While building those same nuclear weapons, Iranian leaders began to openly declare their plan to wipe Israel from the face of the earth. (4) It&rsquo;s bad enough that Pakistan has nuclear weapons, but if anymore fanatical Muslim nations, such as Iran, obtains nuclear missles, it will prove horrible for the entire Middle East, including White, Western nations. Mr. Miller might have some right ideas, but being empathetic to Iran is not one of them.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155519" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think most of us are at a loss in how to deal with the current direction and decline of our country (USA). There are several options that many of us are weighing (secession, civil war, third party, doing nothing and giving up, etc.). Much of this new to many of us. It will take time to see which choice is best for us and for our people. </p>
<p>In the meantime, we can still begin a &#8216;resistance movement,&rsquo; so to speak. Here&rsquo;s a few things to consider that we can do on an individual basis: (1) We can try, to the best of our ability, to do business only with other Whites or White-owned companies. (2) Start up local organizations or discussion groups that are geared toward educating Whites about their racial heritage, the serious threat of non-White immigration and other topics that help our race. (3) Support political-social organizations that are explicitly pro-White (e.g., Amren, Council of Concerned Citizens, James Edwards). (4) Teach your children about the horrors of multiculturalism and political-correctness. Teach them about White history and instill in them a sense of pride in what the White man has accomplished. In spite of what others say, our White countries and cities are the envy of the world. (5) Make it normal in your household to laugh and ridicule liberalism, particularly the multicultural nonsense. (6) Reach out to other Whites who might be open to our message. Don&rsquo;t be pushy, but look for avenues to speak to them about such matters. This assumes, of course, that you will keep yourself informed and well-read on these kinds of things. </p>
<p>I have many things to say, especially on a practical level, but that will come some other time. I hope this in some way helps.</p>

It quickly morphed into a purely business party bankrolled by a handfull of plutocrats. That began to change in the period after WWII as middle and working class whites from non-WASP backgrounds began to vote Republican. But in its essentials, the party seems to be morphing once more to try to look like the changing demographics. As noted by the writer, this is a suicidal strategy because any Republican party that has to accommodate large numbers of minorities will not be a party that most whites will be comfortable in. Especially when whites begin to realize that these &#8220;new Republicans&#8221; think much like Democrats. Of course, by that time, it would be too late. And now that more minority babies were born this year than white babies, the handwriting is on the wall.</p>

These are the conservatives who are so shocked that millions of would-be GOP voters stayed home on election day. Public unions are a public menace, but do these so-called conservatives expect teachers to just roll over and die when teachers take the heat for decades of failed educational reforms aimed at turning non-whites into good students? Jeb Bush riles up the base with union depredations while planning an amnesty and an increase in legal immigration. </p>

I always thought they were against the indoctrination of agendas, not necessarily looking to be a rallying point for clones of the Westboro Church clowns. I&rsquo;m not gonna lie and say I&rsquo;m not against making homosexuality out to be a more sublime &#8220;alternative&#8221; to heterosexuality, but I certainly don&rsquo;t want the issue of homosexuality to be confused in any way with the fundamental issue of Race/Nation. I truly don&rsquo;t want to know what goes on between consenting adults. Unfortunately, if given the chance, I do believe most of these &#8220;family values&#8221; types are not just concerned with their own set of values and families, but will also quickly gravitate toward the same kind of intrusiveness and intolerance that afflicts The Left.</p>

<p>Start local resistance to Sec. 8, refugee resettlement and the like. Can&rsquo;t be explicitly racial or you will attract attention of DOJ. US has anarcho-tyranny with near totalitarian police state methods directed against whites who don&rsquo;t &#8220;know their place.&#8221; </p>
<p>Only a small pct. will ever home school so there should be a push for more local autonomy for schools. The cultural bolsheviks have effective control of every school in the country-with the<br/>
possible exceptions of Amish and ultra-orthodox Jewish schools. What people do strictly on ) their own (like &#8220;buying white&#8221;) has zero effect in a country of 330 million people. </p>
<p>People tend to give up if they have no prospect of success-that&rsquo;s why proportional representation methods with a low threshold are needed. See the examples of Greece, Netherlands, Finland and Israel. THis is necessary because non-sheeple whites are a minority everywhere and strength has to be expanded from a base that is not big enough to win a plurality election.</p>

There used to be a time when an official of our Representative Democracy was elected in order to &#8220;represent&#8221; those considered to be his constituency &mdash; certainly to represent those people that elected the official in the first place. Now it seems that the only agenda for these vultures, hyenas and various parasites is to get elected just so they can get elected again and help further the vitality of a Party, not a People.</p>
<p>Does anyone believe Rand Paul was elected to represent Kentucky because all those middle class Americans thought he would give illegals a path to steal more jobs, drain more resources, and wreck the economy even further?</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-155793" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The Mesopotamian single human or the color of the Iraq sand race was wiped out out 4500 years ago in a flood using the ancient Shem white jew writs as difficult as that is to absorb for some since they hate jews and they hate jew writings aka Xianity or White Man Religion. Actually its a million times more believable that the cocaine addict Darwin and his lunacy proving that obviously his theory worked for another latter cocaine addict protege named Walt Disney who was a genius creator imagination fiction expert and obviously relied on the evolutionist BS to make his Micky and Minnie Mouse talking rodents and all others such as Goofy, Tweetie the talking Bird, Foghorn Leghorn the talking rooster, Arnold the pig, etc etc.<br/>
Without Darwin and his love for animals who ultimately talk like humans, there would have been no Disney cocaine cartoon characters or Disney Worlds so children the world over can get their first hand experience with where humans came from.<br/>
And then there was Ed the talking horse, Flipper the yacking dolphin, Mighty Mouse, Lassie the collie dog, etc. Today the pc characters are from the computer graphics and completely imagined with all the colors and shapes and sizes or designs and brand new with the humans who are not humans but avatars at all so at least they used to use real animals or fish.</p>
<p>If whites want to get back to the 3 divided unique original NWO races from Shem, Japheth and Ham they need to call their new country race as the Shem or European race that is technically the proper name. Get off the evolution BS. Just pretend the ancient Shem white jews knew their stuff and they are correct because we know ancient jews did not mix and were extremely conscious of the differences in the not only other races but their own white race. Even todays khazar mongoloid race Asian fake jews dont mix unless liberals and do not mix in Israel even with their real arab Shemite Philistines aka Palestinians.<br/>
Another problem is the ignorance of the 3 races and who they are.<br/>
Psalm 51:10 Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me. &hellip;.from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of thou. Flesh is race and spirit is mind. Even Creator is warning all 3 races to keep pure in race and mind. The original unclean filthy mixed race failed although it wasnt mixed since it was the original single human race and this was unknown. The NWO 3 new races were warned to stay clean in race or flesh and mind and separated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ancient mentality of 3500-2000 years ago the facts are clear. The 3 NWO races of white Shem, red yellow Japheth, and black Ham were to remain pure in flesh race and mind and not defiled in any way. This was ratified by Shemite European white latino Constantine of WMR in 321AD. Nothing has changed.</p>

Even in the past, White Racism often had defensive meaning, rather then offending. Japanese as a prominent Asian entity are also Racists, where during WWII they expressed extremely brutal Racism. To day, nobody pays any attention to Japanese Racism. Same we have with Chinese, not to mention Muslims, which are the worse, with exclusively aggressive Racism. </p>
<p>My point is that White Protective Racism is benign. I don&rsquo;t want Black or any other race as slaves or to own them. I have no hostility against Blacks. I just want to keep distance from them for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Hence, White Protective Racism is civilization Defensive Line against intruders. In this context, I am fiery White Racist. I advises every White, get rid of archaic fear being labeled as Racist. Your Protective Racism is our common defensive line and please do proudly pass this value on others. </p>
<p>Among all Races, only Blacks are constantly playing on Race cards for any trivia. In addition, did you notice that there is Racial conflict only in Whites-Blacks relations? Why, because they are like leeches, they can&rsquo;t survive without Whites, not in US nor in their independent banana states. If we would move to Mars, they would try to follow, because no one else would take care about them.</p>

<p>Some people define &#8216;white racists&rsquo; as a) white people who have four fingers and a thumb on their left hand and b) those who don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Social engineers seem to have devised an &#8220;attach and attack&#8221; strategy, whereby they attach the &#8216;racist&rsquo; label on those with whom they disagree, the use that label as justification to attack the label wearer. </p>
<p>That makes me wonder . . . </p>

<p>The GOP will look abroad at the so-called conservative movement in places like Canada. A right-centrist approach is working there, but Canada has one big advantage: it is still about as white as the U.S. was in 1980. </p>
<p>If Canada&rsquo;s non-white population reaches the critical mass of non-whites that the U.S. has, the pendulum will swing to the left forever. Thereafter it becomes a race to the bottom, with parties and politicians trying to out-promise each other on social spending.</p>

In wild life, no Lion would tolerate hyenas messing with his lionesses, although proud Lionesses would not need help in keeping away hyina-ni66ers. Too often, we are failing in protection of our women against ni66er-hyinas. </p>
<p>We failed here, because we didn&rsquo;t prevent Libertardian promiscuous cross-race breeding ideology. We failed educating young girls on racial dignity, which equals with personal dignity. If nature or if you prefer God made us White, Black or any other color, do we need changing this. In addition, this is not about skin color; it is about huge civilization differences.

He should read Kelleigh Nelson&rsquo;s &#8220;The Phony Right-Wing, Part 4&#8243;. She researched Cain and found him to be a puppet for The Koch Brothers and AFP. He&rsquo;s also tied in with ALEC with its pro-scientology membership. Bradley says Cain is tough on illegal immigration. However, back on October 11, 2011, I posted a piece on Cain titled &#8220;Cain Pushes &#8216;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&rsquo;; Bachmann Decries Anchor Babies In Debate&#8221;. Cain used &#8220;a pathway to citizenship&#8221; often in 2011. Yet he avoided descibing what he meant by &#8220;pathway to citizenship&#8221; of which there are already legal ways to do it. That is hardly someone who is &#8220;tough on illegal immigration&#8221;! Cain is a very wealthy former CEO, like Romney and he&rsquo;s trying to rehabilitate himself in the MSM but he&rsquo;s a sexual groper and is NOT someone Conservatives will be following in a third party!<br/>
I agree with Bradley on The Constitution Party but Bradley doesn&rsquo;t mention the &#8220;libertarian infilration&#8221; which I believe goes right to the top of that party. Chuck Baldwin, The CP&rsquo;s Presidential nominee in 2008, has &#8220;gone Libertarian&#8221; on legalization of illicit drugs and constantly writes praises of his friend, Ron Paul. Any party advocating the legalization of illicit drugs at the Federal or state level is NOT a true Conservative party. While The CP doesn&rsquo;t state &#8220;legalization of illicit drugs&#8221; in their excellent platform, some of their state leaders do. Some of their leaders believe that illicit drugs &#8220;is a state issue&#8221;, but it&rsquo;s Federal law, so saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s a state issue&#8221; isn&rsquo;t going to change anything. No way are Conservatives going to want to do business with the murderous Mexican and Columbian Drug Cartel because that&rsquo;s what will happen if illicit drugs are legalized!</p>

<p>Nein nein nein.</p>
<p>Sorry, I just had to.</p>
<p>But my own mother, the woman who sat me on her knees and taught me from a young age how to despise blacks, the right way, fell for him and his act. I tried to argue with her, I reminded her of her own words to me that went something along the lines of &#8220;an n-word is an n-word is an n-word&hellip;no matter how you dress &#8216;em up.&#8221; Then I reminded her of his history of sexual harassment as a supervisor of women, and that there is no way she would have put up with 0.001% of the kind of shenanigans he was accused of for even 0.001 second. It was like I was talking to a brick wall.</p>

At this very moment, you are more endangered species than we are here in Europe. Without new charismatic leaders and fresh attractive concept, my dear cousins you are at best to waste 500 years of White civilization that you built. Demographic body of two in alliance with White Left Loons bestowed victory to O. It was they against you; hence, White unity as a counterweight is an imperative against Black and Latinos homogenization. It is all about your survival, or an irrational (insane) transition could become the most ridiculous take over in the history of humankind.</p>

It is our only hope.When the tough Arizona law was passed every Republican in the legislature voted for it .Every Democrat voted against it.

<div id="dsq-comment-message-156186" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here&rsquo;s my suggestion: every white patriot here should perform this simple test: determine in <b>your</b> mind the foremost white nationalist thinker in America. Not the top five, or the top three - but the foremost <b>one.</b></p>
<p>Then send an email to <i>that</i> individual, be it David Duke, Jared Taylor, Kevin Alfred Strom, Jeff Schoep, &#8220;Von Bluvens&#8221;, Merlin Miller, or whomever, asking them to tell you their plan for restoring America to a white nation. If they can&rsquo;t, or won&rsquo;t or otherwise seem befuddled, (and yet you believe they&rsquo;re the best we&rsquo;ve got!) then you should:</p>
<p>1 - Accept the new multi-racial USA and worry no more</p>
<p>2 - Pack your bags and flee to some other country</p>
<p>Because at that point you&rsquo;ll finally realize that even our best white nationalist &#8220;mind&#8221; has no idea what to do. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the individual you&rsquo;ve emailed has offered you a detailed, well-reasoned blueprint for turning back the brown tide then tell the rest of us what it is, so that we can all come together and lend our strength and dedication to the fight. </p>
<p>This is really what&rsquo;s needed. The GOP is dead. It has been for decades. The Democrats are the American version of the former Soviet Union&rsquo;s communist party, jazzed up with modern MTV appeal. The A3P is like a 4th of July pop-bottle rocket that simply fizzled out into a worthless dud. </p>
<p>A specific pro-white nationalist movement is our last hope, in my view. A &#8220;Golden Dawn&#8221; on a continental scale. There&rsquo;s even an uplifting, catchy name for it: HEARTLAND - standing for &#8220;Helping Euro Americans Reclaim Their Land And National Destiny&#8221; - which stays it all in one simply word.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-156252" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There needs to be a European American third party that is not hopelessly entangled amongst open-borders libertarians. There are libertarians who are quite sensible on border issues, but that does not change the truth of the first sentence. If our grandkids&rsquo; grandkids are ultimately engulfed by third-world peoples, will the last survivors, as their lives are being winked out by the final waves of dispossession and &lsquo;random&rsquo; violence, as in South Africa, really care all that much how the ultimate blame should be apportioned among the open-borders Democrats, open-borders Republicans and open-borders libertarians?</p>
<p>Today, as whites become ever more buried under third-world demographics, any slight hope for a winning national party is flickering out. But there is no reason why survival of Western civilization should be fought on a single battlefield. And when the bloated broke ungainly American empire starts breaking apart, as it must, among all of its wonderfully diverse vibrant third-world cultures, it would not hurt whites to have a sane operational national party already in place that can lend its support wherever it can. </p>
<p>I agree with some I have heard that most progress needs to be made on the local level, I believe probably county. I live in California in a county more white and &lsquo;red&rsquo; than is true of many red states, surrounded on almost all sides by other heavily white conservative counties. Of course these are rural counties and so when it comes to statewide voting this means nothing up against the throngs of liberals in the Bay Area, the third-world voter takeover of the Central Valley, the wine-and-cheese liberals basking along the coast and the teeming anthill that has become Los Ugliness. However, once finally organized, whites might very well surprise even themselves. Of course all this needs to happen soon.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-156351" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks @curry, for hint on Frank Borzellieri testimonies, which sound like a horror story. When and how all these happened? I understand if your clearly defined enemy tries to destroy your existence. As in any regular war, they wear uniform (this time it is Black skin), so you now who is who. Enemy within your ranks, that is an ultimate disaster. </p>
<p>White Libertarded Hippies and Homosexual Degeneracy are fatal for our civilization. Their insidious pernicious actions are comparable in consequences with massive countless and sustained 9/11 terrorist attacks. </p>
<p>If these idiots will ever realize on their own what actually they are doing, it will be too late. They must be neutralized now, ASAP, unless America is willing to risk sort of future civil war. Ancient Rome disintegrated due to insidious decadency and general mental decomposition.</p>
<p>Remember ex Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa. Same White Libertards worldwide frantically were pushing Whites in total surrender. Evidence of their wisdom is visible on every corner in these two countries. Zimbabwe is &#8220;prosperous&#8221; Apefrican dictatorship, and South Africa Whites are terrorized that many left the country. Add to these Blacks on Whites crime in US on daily scale, even before they are dominant power, and you have &#8220;weather forecast&#8221; for Black Terror-Hurricane of category not recorded yet. </p>
<p>Aside of mandatory Political Correctness, there are more early warning signs, remember Black Harvard professor and Martin Trevor incident. Hussein-O shamelessly intervened on behalf of his people. I can&rsquo;t recall that any US president ever did something similar. Remember his open calls to Black constituency to vote for him in revenge. All these already happen now when country is not yet in Black hands and I even didn&rsquo;t mention next in line - &#8220;friendly&#8221; Islam.</p>
<p>I know, empires come and go but it is too early for this one, when we all know how it works. At the end, one think puzzles me more than anything else, what the hell is boiling in Libertarian heads? Do they have any anticipating abilities, any long-term responsibilities for their grandchildren? Are they subconsciously masochistic self-destructive loons, &#8220;enlightened&#8221; by dubious philanthropic illusions?</p>

We live in strange times, currently migrant labor is widely used across the entire nation because of one simple fact. They&rsquo;re cheap as hell. When posed with the question of what many food producers would do if migrant labor didn&rsquo;t exist they don&rsquo;t say that they would be forced to hire Americans to pick their product, but instead, they say they&rsquo;d most likely invest in robots which could pick their crops. As the years go by the technology and price of these robotic fruit pickers are expected to drop dramatically. And as the prices drop you better believe that more and more farmers will start investing in the robots as opposed to risk paying illegal immigrants. So no, it won&rsquo;t be the minutemen on the border who stops the tide of illegals coming in the country, it will more likely be some nerd who developed a robot which will take the migrant workers job.</p>
<p>Of course these robots would bring some other benefits. Due to recent laws which were passed in Alabama against using migrant labor we saw hundreds of crops which were literally &lsquo;rotting on the vine&rdquo; because they couldn&rsquo;t find any American to do the job. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time they invested in a robot.</p>
<p>Like i say hispanic labor will be in less demand in 10 years. Encourage your farmers to use robots as much as possible.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-156458" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The whole &#8220;who will pick our crops&#8221; is a common cry heard by many corporatist demagogues or others who know nothing but how to parrot and regurgitate false dichotomies and blatant lies. &#8220;Picking crops&#8221; is just one of the many areas where the illegals have been used as a sledgehammer to reduce the livelihood of legal Americans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Legal Americans wouldn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t pick their own crops; it&rsquo;s that they literally can&rsquo;t afford to pick crops for the slave labor pay and conditions that many agribusinesses are allowed to get away with while using illegals. I&rsquo;m not willing to have 12 other people shack up with me and share bills just so I can pay the rent. Are you?</p>
<p>I actually lived in rural MS and TN for a short time when I was little. I don&rsquo;t remember EVER seeing a Mexican picker, much less a group of them. How did we survive?</p>
<p>The notion that machines and robots will take over isn&rsquo;t something new, so the suggestion that robots or automation will replace humans for many menial tasks isn&rsquo;t something that needs to be encouraged, because it has already happened to a great extent and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The premise is that the uneducated, culturally divisive illegals are simply doing jobs that Americans refuse to do, and they provide average Americans with &#8220;cheap&#8221; things to get through the day. Never once do the defenders of the illegals ever include in that premise the sheer destructive element that those illegals have on a culture or the negative drain they cause to resources. It&rsquo;s all about businesses shaving expenditures anywhere and everywhere they can, just so they can increase the money flow to the top. Money, money, money! Walmart executives are billionaires many times over, while their average employee has to rely on government assistance. Money, money, money.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a groundbreaking solution that many weak-at-the-knees liberals can&rsquo;t seem to comprehend. If having millions of non-English speaking, culturally evasive, uneducated illegal Mexicans working for pennies on the dollar(and slave labor conditions in many cases) are the answer to America&rsquo;s problems, then why is the suggestion that millions of prisoners be used as a workforce so insulting and revolting? They have no problem with evasive, culture destroying Mexicans being left to graze freely, but they think it insane to have prisoners work to provide for their own sustenance and GET PAID to help provide for the rest of their non-incarcerated countrymen?</p>

<p>&#8220;Jared Taylor for President&#8221; is actually the smartest statement in your post, Jupiter. Along with the notion that Presidential politics is above our pay grade and will be as long as Presidential campaigns are as expensive as they are.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an easy way to bring down the cost of Presidential and many other campaigns without having to undo <i>Citizens United</i>   &mdash;   Use the same power the FCC uses to prohibit cigarette advertising to prohibit political advertising by candidates or that mentions candidates&rsquo; names. TV media buys are the big money pit of many campaigns, and if the FCC factored them out by decree, then campaigns would get a lot cheaper, and at that point, there could be a really affordable public financing scheme. Radio buys are far cheaper, you can still allow them. And third party buys would not be allowed to mention candidates&rsquo; names. And you&rsquo;d need some strict fairness doctrine style rules to offset leftist media bias.</p>
<p>A side benefit from this is that it would kill the Karl Roverrated style barnacle industry.</p>

This starts with a withdrawal of consent form the policy of race-replacement. A revolt along these lines will never be ignited with endless-the mind-glazes-over-debates about the finer points of psychometrics. Jared has yet to come up with the right framework for igniting a Native Born White American Patriot revolt against race-replacement.</p>

<p>America will not &#8220;change&#8221;. It will have to collapse. That brings a whole other set of problems, but we will have to go through it.</p>
<p>In my mind, the only way to avoid that scenario would be for 40 or 50 million Whites ALL standing up and saying no more and refusing to live around non-Whites.</p>
<p>That is not going to happen. We have no leader. We have no organization. We have no &#8220;belief&#8221; system (like the Jews do). We have no &#8220;God&#8221; or religious foundation.</p>

<p>We are witnessing profound and rapid change socially, and economically. A good topic for an issue of The Occidental Quarterly would be exactly this. Also, the probable death of the GOP should be considered as well as the probable realignment of its constituencies.</p>

Anyway, on this topic, let me say that originally the Libertarian Party stood for secure borders. But in the late 80&#8242;s and early 90&#8242;s it was taken over by Leftists and anarchists who wanted open borders. What they don&rsquo;t understand is that the most important job of a minimal state is to secure the borders. What we have now is a security risk: terrorists can come in, as well as Hispanics. The 11 million illegal Hispanics who are now in the country amount to a foreign invasion. I&rsquo;m an &#8220;old&#8221; Libertarian and Objectivist who wants individual liberty, self-responsibility, limited government, free enterprise, and a strong defense. This latter stands for well-protected borders. Legal immigrants who accept American principles are welcome, illegals are not.</p>
