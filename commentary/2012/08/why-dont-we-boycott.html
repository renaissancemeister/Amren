<h1 class="title">Why Don&rsquo;t We Boycott?</h1>
  
<p class="articleSource">Peter Bradley, American Renaissance, August 31, 2012</p>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
Starbucks would be a good start.</div> 
</div> 


<p>Last month&rsquo;s Chick-fil-A controversy got me thinking about boycotts (and retaliatory &ldquo;buycotts&rdquo;).  In particular, I wondered why our side doesn&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>The thought occurred to me again as I read an <a href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/08/a_diverse_student_body_adds.html">article</a> called &ldquo;<a href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/08/a_diverse_student_body_adds.html">Basketball Coaches and Starbucks Push for Affirmative Action</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was published at ColorLines.com, a minority-oriented website that at least <a href="http://colorlines.com/about">describes itself</a> honestly as &ldquo;a daily news site where race matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The title of the article speaks for itself but here is a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>They may be strange bedfellows, but there is one issue of national import that the National Association of Basketball Coaches, the Obama administration and Starbucks have come together to support: affirmative action.</p>
<p>Last week these parties, alongside more than five dozen other groups, told the Supreme Court they believe universities ought to be able to take race into consideration in their admissions policies. Their court filings set the stage for the Supreme Court, which is set to take up the politically fraught issue this fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>Starbucks has a long history of anti-white activism. The company funded the opposition to the 1998 Washington Civil Rights Initiative, which targeted racial preferences in the state.</p>
<p>It also worked with the NAACP to fund something called &ldquo;Civil Rights Schools,&rdquo; which promote black interests.</p>
<p>If homosexuals can boycott Chick-fil-A over its CEO&rsquo;s personal stance on marriage and Christians can support the company for the same reason, why can&rsquo;t whites boycott Starbucks for supporting and funding discrimination against our children?</p>
<p>Foregoing a cup of coffee is not a hardship. There are many coffee shops in most towns, and boycotters would not have to take a public position that could threaten their jobs. They would just stop buying anything at Starbucks.</p>
<p>Such a boycott would not have much impact if it were organized by American Renaissance or the Council of Conservative Citizens. The media would either ignore it or write headlines like &ldquo;White Supremacists Threaten Starbucks for Defending Civil Rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what if a mainstream conservative such as Michelle Malkin, Ann Coulter, or Sean Hannity started the boycott in the name of equal rights and color-blind justice? The &ldquo;buycott&rdquo; in support of Chick-fil-A began with a single tweet from former Arkansas Governor and current talk show host Mike Huckabee.</p>
<p>The support of Chick-fil-A resulted in lines out the door and some restaurants ran out of food. The media &mdash; no fans of anyone who opposes homosexual marriage &mdash; was forced at least to mention the event, and even had to admit that boycott had backfired.</p>
<p>If a mainstream conservative advocated a boycott of Starbucks because of its support for racial preferences it would inevitably get media attention &mdash; mostly negative. However, what if Rush Limbaugh mentioned it on his program to 20 million listeners? What if The Drudge Report picked it up? What if some Tea Party groups joined the boycott?</p>
<p>Perhaps a few enterprising restaurant or coffee shop owners would offer &ldquo;discrimination-free&rdquo; coffee to entice new customers. Conservative groups could hold meetings at Seattle&rsquo;s Best, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts, or other Starbucks competitors.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SeattlesBest.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101116" title="Starbucks Seattles Best" alt="" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SeattlesBest.jpg" width="512" height="379"/></a></p>
<p>In the age of Facebook and Twitter, the boycott could be promoted to millions of people instantly.</p>
<p>Starbucks would probably hold its ground initially. But what if sales declined by even 1 or 2 percent? The company is listed on the NASDAQ exchange. What if the stock price started slipping? What if a few shops had to close?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say a retaliatory &ldquo;buycott&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t work, since all the liberals who would get worked up about it already</p>
<p>Even lefties have a bottom line, and a boycott of Starbucks could succeed, if planned and executed properly.</p>
<p>Boycotts seem to be almost entirely a  tool of the left. In fact, I can&rsquo;t recall a single nationwide boycott started by conservatives. I would love to be involved in a boycott of an anti-white company or organization. Count me in if one is ever organized.</p>

<p>Why Starbucks would support AA is completely beyond me.  They are already the employer of last resort for tens of thousands of liberal arts graduates working off their $60,000 tuition debt at $10/hr coffee-pouring jobs.  Maybe our AA cousins have too much difficultly learning all those pseudo-Italian made-up words that they use to describe their $4.00 cups of hot water, flavored corn syrup, and 20 cents worth of burned-up coffee beans.</p>

First it was black barristas then it was homosexual black barraistas at a lot of locations in Chicago. And it has probably been a few years since I have actually spent my own money. Once gift cards I don&rsquo;t know what i did to acquire were gone, haven&rsquo;t been back. </p>
<p>The roasts they use aren&rsquo;t that good, but corporate did do a good job at building a brand, too good.<br/>
Too many people think burnt beans are good coffee (or espresso). </p>
<p>B&N serves their coffee and I stopped going there too when I offended a worker by referring to a former co-worker of theirs as a &#8220;morbidly obese sexual degenerate&#8221; and a manager &#8220;talked&#8221; to me about it a few days later. My response &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about me ever doing that again. I will never patronize this establishment again.&#8221;   &mdash;   That&rsquo;s good management &hellip;.. $1000+ a year just walked out the door without a response. And I now just get my Lavazza or Illy espresso an make it at home</p>

<p>Where can we get our coffee if it is NOT leftist-run? It seems to me that in every coffee place I&rsquo;ve patronised that is not Starbucks, the clientele and management are even <i>more</i> SWPL than the average Starbucks inhabitant.</p>
<p>Mind you, I live in Planet Boulder now (shoot me) but I found it similar in Houston and its exurbs.</p>

<p>So another requirement would be that they buy their coffee from nations which are also pro-white. They don&rsquo;t have to BE white; I am for any nation which is for me. So: Honduras, Costa Rica, Ethiopia perhaps? Maybe even Nigeria these days; I hear they&rsquo;re inviting in the Rhodesians, and any friend of Rhodesia or the Boers is a friend of mine.</p>

I&rsquo;ll get the ball rolling: 1) YES, I think a boycott is a great idea. 2) Not sure about Starbucks. Perhaps a bank, like Bank of America, or an insurance company, like Allstate. 3) I don&rsquo;t know, billboards seem to elicit a great deal of attention. Hey all you smart White people, let&rsquo;s discuss this!  </p>

<p>I think AmRen or CoCC should expand their online stores. I think we should stick to a Chick-A-Fil format. Harness the buying power of our &#8220;community&#8221; and put it to good use. Selling something like ground coffee (just for example) and use the profits to expand the sites or put up pro-White billboards, etc. Maybe an Amazon-like web site where everything is made in America? Give us the chance to buy stuff from people not working directly against our interests.</p>

Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are wormeaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! I am not for tying or fastening them on the tree in any way, except by nature&rsquo;s plan, and if they will not stay there, let them fall. And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pro-black literature is not a problem.  Anti-white literature, like Tim Wise, Malcolm X, the guy who came up with &#8220;Black Liberation Theology&#8221;, and so on, is ironically the kind of hate that the leftists think we produce.</p>

<p>How many people here would be willing to organize and meet on a local level on a very regular basis?</p>
<p>How many people here would be willing(or can even afford) to pay $10 for something they could possibly get for $5?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this kind of thing before, and I&rsquo;ve always come away being disappointed by the lack of persistence and tenacity from people. Look around the Internet at the amount of boycotts that were talked about. There are virtually none that had any kind of lasting impact.</p>
<p>An effective boycott <i>can</i> become a reality, but it literally takes a small army of extremely diligent, persistent and creative people.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely correct about buying power. The purchasing power of ten thousand people being taken away from a major corporation is like shooting a shotgun at a battleship. The corporation wouldn&rsquo;t even notice; they wouldn&rsquo;t even care if they did notice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the purchasing power of ten thousand people could easily support a few smaller businesses, who could then turn around and put pressure on those bigger corporations. The big corporations rely on depression of wages, coupled with the cheaper prices that they can acquire products, to run small businesses in to the ground. When you have a consumer base that uses their purchasing power as a weapon, you can effectively put a small business on the exact same level as a big corporation in terms of viability.</p>
<p>Capitalism&rsquo;s biggest vulnerability is that it relies on capital. The same capital that the consumer uses to feed mega corporations on a daily basis is the exact same capital that a consumer can use to support alternatives. Of course, the alternatives are almost always going to take a lot more effort and/or money to support, so most people take the lazy route and complain about the big corporations, but still give them their money.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-123976" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>(I&rsquo;m of two minds about this article. Here&rsquo;s my first take)</p>
<p>&#8220;If homosexuals can boycott Chick-fil-A over its CEO&rsquo;s personal stance on marriage and Christians can support the company for the same reason, why can&rsquo;t whites boycott Starbucks for supporting and funding discrimination against our children?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol! Because Christians have a Christian consciousness, homosexuals have a homosexual consciousness, and most whites still have an anti-white consciousness!</p>
<p>We have a ways to go before whites can be activated AS WHITES by a talk show host (and before a talk show host will risk it), the way already awakened and empowered groups like Christians and homosexuals can be activated.</p>
<p>But hopefully I&rsquo;m mistaken in thinking your idea is premature.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t it be ironic if the most effective sentence in your article is this one:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Starbucks has a long history of <b>anti-white</b> activism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The term &#8220;<b>anti-white</b>&#8221; is being consciously spread by many of us who think it&rsquo;s the most effective soldier we have fighting for us at this moment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deploy this soldier constantly, the same way that <b>anti-whites</b> have deployed their soldier that has won the Western World for them, their big bad R-word!</p>
<p>When the term &#8220;<b>anti-white</b>&#8221; occupies as large a space in white brains as the r-word does presently, then the ability to trigger effective boycotts and other actions will be real.</p>

<p>The necessity of spreading our own term &#8220;<b>anti-white</b>&#8221; to push aside the reigning <b>anti-white</b> term, the r-word, I stick by of course. If you haven&rsquo;t thought that through, please do.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m less certain some kind of boycott couldn&rsquo;t be triggered at the present moment. It could be a great consciousness-raising event itself, possibly jumping us ahead years, and empowering whites as whites.</p>
<p>The delicate task of choosing the right issue and framing it is certainly within the talents of some of the talk show hosts, and some emails to them suggesting it would be a very good idea. Even if they don&rsquo;t do it, the emails will make an impression on them and move them a slight bit forward possibly.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-body-124054" class="dsq-comment-body">
<div id="dsq-comment-message-124054" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;ve read every comment below and I was going to add some long, &#8216;deep&rsquo; diatribe, which, on a good day, maybe ten people might read.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth (aka my 3 cents worth), this country didn&rsquo;t go from pro-white to anti-white in a week. It took decades upon decades of gradual destruction to go from where we were pre-1965 (or pre-1955, if you&rsquo;d rather), to where we are today (and have been for a while).</p>
<p>Even if everything went our way (which is highly unlikely, considering the demographics, the culture, the immigration laws and a thousand other things stacked against us), it would take another fifty years (at least) to get back to where we were.</p>
<p>One thing which would and could work right away (and I&rsquo;ve suggested this on here before a bunch of times), is if, for example AmRen started up an AmRen Store. You could sell the usual stuff everybody else on the planet sells (coffee cups, beer mugs, t-shirts, caps, bumper sticks - you name it - whatever Jared Taylor thinks would sell).</p>
<p>Why not? Everybody and his grandmother who has a site, sells this stuff. If Jamaal and Shaniqua can sell &#8216;black power&rsquo; crap on the Net and make money from their sales, I <b>know</b> Jared & Co. could do the job 100x better. And the impact would be immediate. There would be no fifty year wait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d buy a coffee cup and a beer mug and a t-shirt, to start (that&rsquo;s a promise), even though I don&rsquo;t need another coffee cup and beer mug and t-shirt. It&rsquo;s not individually much, but if (almost) every poster on here were to back up their words with a little money, it would go to an organization that looks out for us. I had a subscription almost since the beginning to the hard copy of AmRen before it was discontinued.</p>
<p>Do people donate to AmRen? Sure they do, but it&rsquo;s hardly a ton. Some people like to feel they&rsquo;re getting something material for their money instead of altruistic giving. Why? Because that&rsquo;s just the way some people feel.</p>
<p>Will some people boycott Starbucks? Maybe a few people who read the above article directly or b/c they received it via email or from another post. You&rsquo;re never going to get ten million or a million or a hundred thousand or ten thousand people to boycott Starbucks, as much as we may want them to.</p>
<p>And since nobody is going to stand outside Starbucks with a sign saying, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t patronize Starbucks. They hate white people&#8221; (or whatever), b/c at best, people will look inside - see NOTHING BUT white people - and think you&rsquo;ve lost your mind. Most people on earth are clueless when it comes to matters like this. Not that it isn&rsquo;t a lofty goal (to make people more aware), but in reality, it&rsquo;s just not going to happen.</p>
<p>None of us one here knows anybody else on here - or maybe one or two other people at best. (I actually do know two other people who post here in real life - and so may some of you). So, none of will know if any other of us boycotts Starbucks or just about any other company which exists, because they&rsquo;re almost <b>ALL</b> anti-white. So unless you live in a cabin in the woods and are completely self-sufficient, this has a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of working.</p>
<p>And in a couple of days, this story will have made it&rsquo;s way down the page and unfortunately most people will have forgotten about it. (Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s just the way things go.)</p>
<p><b>BUT</b> an AmRen Store would have a positive impact money-wise as soon as it&rsquo;s up and running. Sure, it&rsquo;s more work and sure it&rsquo;s more time, but if it works, it will have one helluva bigger and more immediate impact than any boycott for anti-white reasons.</p>
<p>*sigh* I see that my diatribe became long and &#8216;deep&rsquo; anyway, even though it had nothing to do with what I was originally going to write.</p>
<p>P.S. I had Starbucks one time in my life and I thought it was average and best and waaaaaaaay overpriced.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-124062" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is a good start, and another place where whites can show their festering and growing anger is boycotting college and professional sports. Both have been turned into nothing but black worshipping and lining the pockets of those who hate and despise us with our ever scarcer and increasingly devalued dollars. I see no reason to give them one red cent, and I for one have boycotted sports, both college and professional for all of my adult life. Sports has become the opiate of white Americans, an opiate that also gets white women killed, raped, impregnated and infected by darkies. That is another reason why I boycott, ignore and refuse to devote any attention to college and professional sports, especially the ones that are overun by blacks.  Whites should not send their sons and daughters to these colleges and universities that elevate sports above all else, because that puts their lives and well being in danger. Nor should they donate anything to them, these institutions are literally enemy territory. When a black athlete can get away Scott free with raping a white girl while holding a gun to her head, that should be reason enough not to send your son or daughter to the college or univeristy that allows this.</p>

BTW who is the &#8220;athlete&#8221; who held the gun to the girl&rsquo;s head while he raped her? He needs to have a gun held to HIS head and let the hammer fall. I could volunteer for that job and my only feeling would be a slight recoil.</p>

<p>I like to play sports and watch sports, but it takes the fun out of it every time I remember, these guys get paid more between two commercial breaks than I get paid in a year. It&rsquo;s an indignity for me to watch them.</p>

Besides that, companies like Starbucks are so indoctrinated with multicult thinking that they wouldn&rsquo;t want your racist money anyway.</p>
<p>White nationalists don&rsquo;t have the power to economically destroy a company like Starbucks out right. White nationalists have to resort to the death of a thousand cuts. First, do not give the company any of your money. Second, bad mouth the company so others will not as well. And, when you are doing the badmouthing, consider your audience. Telling your Prius driving neighbor and her sandal wearing boyfriend that Starbucks is evil because it is anti-white probably is not going to have the effect you want. However, if you mention that the foam that they use to make their cups is destroying the ozone layer&hellip; Yes, it is manipulative and sleazy. But sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.</p>

I refuse to contribute to the Darfur project because  1. The genocide against the Animist Christians is being perpetrated by the Muslim government of Sudan and I&rsquo;ve never heard a criticism of their actions by our Muslim enamored govt . 2 There is a genocide in progress against White farm families in SA and in Zimbabwe while our Government looks the other way as it does right here in America while a Black Panther calls for the murder of White babies.<br/>

The idea of declaratory principles that put LIMITS on government while expanding personal freedoms and rights that originate from our CREATOR, (not &#8220;permissions&#8221; from government) was (and is) NEVER tried before and made the United States the most prosperous country on earth-in fact SO prosperous that we probably support YOUR country with &#8220;foreign aid&#8221; . . .<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-124748" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> Yes, it is all very interesting.  As long as we are on this subject, I would also like to notate that they way or style of European rudeness is often very different, veiled, I guess you could say, until you get into a real conversation with them.  This turns out to cause a very different style of rudeness from the type I experience from Americans or even English speakers (native, I mean) anywhere, with Canadians being more like Americans than any other.  The difference is that Europeans will and have maintained the polite exterior better than Americans (most of the time).  I mean, in certain parts of the South, like a part of East Texas I know of, Americans are incredibly polite and gracious, reflecting the old Southern, Western standards that used to prevail in much of the U.S.  </p>
<p>In order to even begin a conversation in Europe, you must say &#8220;hello,&#8221; and or the proper greeting for the time of day, and ask politely before coming to your real purpose AND preferably IN the host Language, and say &#8220;than you.&#8221;  For example, I found in France that if you at least try, they LOVE you, but if you don&rsquo;t try at all, they will shun you and be quite cold.  As you know, many here just say &#8220;hey&#8221; or &#8220;Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to have,&#8221; or more often, &#8220;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll take the hamburger and fries with a coke deal.&#8221;  &#8220;Yo, gimme da nummer fi on yo menu.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Munich, Germans sometimes just spoke English to me first because they knew I was an American on sight.   But they were typically very nice as well.  I did see some bad attitude as well, as when the English language tour  line we were in to enter the Neuschwanstein Castle was let in before a German language tour.  One German man was glaring at the foreigners, obviously outraged that Germans would have to wait on anyone else!  I found the Dutch so friendly I though I was being seduced every other<br/>
time I talked to a young Dutch woman, they just radiate and have a way<br/>
of squeezing their eyes when they say goodbye that makes you feel<br/>
loved.  (Until you get to know them, then it&rsquo;s a bit more difficult).   A youth in Spain mocked me when I tripped over a high doorstrip following him to the proper counter for my business.  In the region I lived and in a few places in Southern Austria, I often heard the list of why where they lived was better than America.  They had every cliche&rsquo; down pat.  The first one usually was, &#8220;It&rsquo;s not safe to walk on your streets.&#8221;  (Whereas it was and hopefully still is VERY true that it is safe in Slovenia and Austria to walk the streets at night).  Of course, I responded by saying that every place in America was not New York City or L. A.  (Also less true today).  But some people also treated me as if I were a celebrity.  Also, big note; Muslims and people obviously NOT European simply ignored me, wherever I ran into them, or eyed me with a look that did not seem kind or well intentioned.</p>
<p>In my overview, Globalization is bringing out the worst characteristics of all cultures, with the greatest influences on it coming from America&rsquo;s worst offerings.  You&rsquo;d be amazed at the phony pop groups that exist outside of the U.S. that exist only for the non-English speaking marketplace.  But I think that what we have in America today is immigrants who have been educated into thinking that Americans don&rsquo;t deserve their own country so it is just fine for them to move in, take over and look down on their American born citizen neighbors.  Just one more dimension of the resulting list of enrichments we reap from Multiculturalism and Diversity.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-124771" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> Actually, it looks to me as if modern genetic researchers are tending to prove Eugenics was basically founded in good, scientific intuition (if you know what I mean).  But the bias of Europeans toward the backward American is very old.  This attitude was quite abundant in the 19th century European mind, which while indulging in this superiority/inferiority complex, was gulping up Western fantasies about the &#8220;noble savage&#8221; and &#8220;gunslinging cowboy.&#8221;  Much of that attitude was hugely reinforced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Buffalo Bill Wild West Show tours in Europe as well as other lesser known ones.  </p>
<p>(Even earlier, Europeans were devouring the Indian myths via J F Cooper novels or even more extreme European rip-offs of the same.  (Also, important to note is that even (by the middle 19th century) Eastern Americans often were nearly as naive).  This is why so many came and settled in the Mid-West completely unprepared for the reality of frontier life.  Texas history is most remarkable in this vein.  The recent counter revisionist history publication, &#8220;A Fate Worse than Death&#8221; (Michno) contains many good examples of this naive tendency of European settlers (and Easterners) who often, sadly, paid a terrible price for their ignorance OR trust in government guarantees.  But the poor always had little choice but to &#8220;Go West).</p>

<p>Subnote;  While living in Europe, I learned that JF Cooper&rsquo;s novels were not only wildly popular in Europe by the early 19th century, but in Germany spawned a large mimic novel culture that I find behind many of the self-righteous Germans (others too) regarding subjects  they love to criticize America for; namely, &#8220;How the whites treated the (poor, noble, spiritually superior) Indian.&#8221;</p>

It was proposed by United States Representative Emanuel Celler of New York, co-sponsored by United States Senator Philip Hart of Michigan and heavily supported by United States Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.&#8221;  In short, the 1965 act was primarily the doings of Emmanuel Celler.  His motivation was to make it easier for Russian Jews to immigrate to the US.   Anyone else that came along for the ride was immaterial and btw, probably desired.  Go to Youtube and do a search for &#8220;Barbara Spectre&#8221;, watch the video on her, and you&rsquo;ll then understand why they&rsquo;re having similar problems in Europe.  </p>

<p>Then there are the prolonged boycotts by people who feel strongly about something and feel that buying a certain product make them complicit in the target company&rsquo;s wrongdoing.  Some boycotts of Israeli products by leftists have been going on for years, with a noticeable  effect on sales, according to one report.</p>
<p>A boycott of Starbucks would probably be  of the second kind.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-124474" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I lived in Europe for a few years in the &rsquo;90s.  One thing I noticed as soon as I got there (Holland) is that they play and people watch those trash tv shows where people fight over child maternity and relationship issues with lots of foul language, etc.  As an American, I found it really embarrassing to see there and realized that a great deal of current European opinion has been based on receiving this as a steady diet for decades now.   I have always hated those shows, but I hated them even more after that.</p>
<p>I also visited the UK and Ireland for an extended period in 1988.  I found all sorts of manners lacking, even table manners in London by white Londoners.  The school children were rude on buses, etc.  Working class English are little more than louts with big mouths (unfortunately) and grown worse in recent years, going by the internet comments they make.</p>
<p>I also learned a long time ago that these guys running these shows get the participants to exaggerate and act out for the sake of the show.  My sister knew some people who were interviewed for one of those shows.  They refused to go on because they wanted them to say really terrible things and they refused.  So you&rsquo;re getting a real idiot, sell-out type who wants more than anything to be on tv.</p>
<p>This xaver is as ignorant as anyone because he gets all his impressions from these shows and other shock media, that Europeans countries like to show to help their own populations feel superior and also deflect complaints about their own government and culture.  I saw a great tendency toward that.  They LOVE playing American films on state television on themes usually dealing with American corruption, racism, hypocrisy, etc.  Of course, only America has produced so many or any such films.  (France banned &#8220;Paths of Glory&#8221; for years for example).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for whites in general, the European hypocrisy behind the criticism of white America is huge.</p>

<p>The definition of Scot-Free&#8221; First off, let&rsquo;s set the record straight on the expression itself   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s actually &#8220;scot-free.&#8221; And contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with Dred Scott or the Scottish.<br/>
Sceot is the Old English for &#8220;a tax.&#8221; Scot and lot was a medieval muncipal tax levied on residents. Someone who managed to avoid paying this medieval tax got off &#8220;scot free.&#8221;Eventually, the word evolved to describe getting away without any kind of punishment, fiscal or otherwise. &#8221;I&rsquo;m very ambivalent towards my fellow Scots, they&rsquo;re all liberals, socialists and marxists.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-124739" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Calling out Starbucks for this outrage is certainly justified, but am opposed to boycotting them at present simply due to the fact that a vast majority (95% at locations I am familiar with) of their current workforce are young native-born Whites. I would urge that we wait some time to see if a rapid demographic swap actually does take place. </p>
<p>Instead of targeting Starbucks immediately, lets look at some other companies of prominence which already feature minority domination and racially-selective hiring practices. Here are a few prominent examples:</p>
<p>7-11<br/>
Auntie Anne&rsquo;s pretzels<br/>
Wawa (many locations)<br/>
Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts (at most locations)<br/>
BP (British Petroleum gas stations)<br/>
Valero gas stations</p>
<p>At service locations associated with all of the above companies, it is entirely common to find staff entirely of a single race- probably from South Asia or Latin America- and it is unlikely an application for employment submitted by anyone not of like background (including  Blacks) will even be looked at. This racial hegemony is established at the local level, by alien franchise-managers. From my observation, it is only broken occasionally- for pretty White girls. </p>
<p>Ironically, Taco Bell is not one of these companies and actually has a fairly balanced (reflecting local demographics) staff at all locations I am familiar with in North Jersey. </p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s is already targeted for boycott (see Paul Kersey&rsquo;s &#8220;Boycott &rsquo;365 Black&rsquo;&#8221; campaign).</p>

The irony is that with his past history as a kid, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to become a cop to arrest people to appear in his courtroom, or be a bailiff in his courtroom. Unless the city is desperate enough to hire black cops.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-259233" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One of the biggest problems I see is the constant facade of the internet. I see people on some of the sites that believe if they only can post more, they are doing something. They cut and paste articles from other news sites, and sometimes offer their opinions. While this can be a hobby or outlet, it isn&rsquo;t helping.</p>
<p>So many &#8220;aware Whites&#8221; are just posting online. Playing in the sandbox is nice, but it won&rsquo;t help your race create a new generation. </p>
<p>I noticed long ago the whole collectivity deal. No matter what happened to you, no other White was going to help you from these sites. At the end of the day, you are on your own. Now, it shouldn&rsquo;t be like this. There are Whites who could offer other Whites jobs. There are Whites with money who could help a poorer White with a college education. Donate a car, do something, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean a &#8220;charitable organization&#8221;. If you are single and have money, leave it to a White guy so he can attend college. Don&rsquo;t just hand over the money, pay the college, and that&rsquo;s his incentive to stay the course.</p>
<p>So boycotting a company isn&rsquo;t as good as helping other Whites. Without this solidarity or unity, we are all on our own. Whites are so fiercely independent for sure, and lot of that goes with higher intelligence, but this a time when we need to be helping our own kind. </p>
<p>I figure if I even can do one thing a year for someone, that&rsquo;s a big step.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-259236" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Because the government pushes this agenda with business. Businesses have to show they are trying to recruit minorities for labor and that they are appealing to their markets. If they can&rsquo;t &#8220;find any&#8221;, they have to show they are offering scholarships or other. They always have to be on the cusp of showing they aren&rsquo;t a &#8220;racist&#8221; organization. One way is to cater to these groups. By over-representing nonwhites in their marketing, advertising, and hiring, they can gain favor and prove their &#8220;diversity&#8221; slant. </p>
<p>We all know they aren&rsquo;t really minorities. It is about the liberal Whites and other factions pushing us out.</p>
