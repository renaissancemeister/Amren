<div class="intro-paragraph">
Discrimination case against Fairfax County is the usual nuttiness.</div> 
</div> 


<p>The NAACP and something called the Coalition of The Silence [sic] have filed a formal <a href="http://www.reston-connection.com/documents/2012/jul/24/discrimination-complaint-filed-regarding-student-a/">complaint</a> with the US Department of Education claiming that the public schools of Fairfax County, Virginia, discriminate against blacks and Hispanics. Their prime piece of evidence is that whites and Asians are far more likely to be admitted to the county&rsquo;s most selective school, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ).</p>
<p>That is true. Here are the racial percentages for all students in the county public schools and the percentages of the 480 students admitted to TJ&rsquo;s class of 2016. All figures are from the complaint.</p>

<p>The complaint argues that problems for blacks and Hispanics begin long before they apply to TJ. Charisse Espy Glassman of the NAACP claims discrimination <a href="http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/article/20120724/NEWS/707249964/1117/discrimination-complaint-targets-thomas-jefferson-admissions&amp;template=fairfaxTimes">begins in kindergarten</a>. She says the county needs to pour resources into the early grades, identify gifted blacks and Hispanics, and funnel them into TJ. Not to do so, she says, violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in education.Thomas Jefferson is one of the most selective public schools in America. It has a rigorous entrance examination that weeds out most applicants, and those who pass are further winnowed on the basis of essays, grades, and recommendations. Most TJ students were in gifted programs at middle school.</p>
<p>Martina Hone of the Coalition of The Silence <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/thomas-jefferson-high-sch_n_1700247.html">agrees</a>: &ldquo;Poor Latino kids are not being identified,Â and I worry part of that is language. African-American kids are not being identified. I&rsquo;m worried that&rsquo;s race.&rdquo; Miss Hone <a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/19103218/discrimination-complaint-filed-against-thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology#ixzz21f9aRtXY">may have</a> special qualifications for detecting discrimination &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a biracial American. I grew up dealing with race&rdquo; &mdash; and she states the key assumption of the DOE complaint <a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/19103218/discrimination-complaint-filed-against-thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology#ixzz21f9aRtXY">without reservation</a>: &ldquo;Look at any study of giftedness. It is equally distributed across humanity. God did not change that rule when he got to Fairfax County.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_100673" style="width: 596px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MartinaHone.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-100673 " title="MartinaHone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MartinaHone.jpg" width="586" height="391"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Martina Hone</p></div>
<p>Miss Hone is flat wrong about that. If there is even one serious study that reports students of all races are equally gifted we would like to see it. There is probably not one gifted program in any of America&rsquo;s 16,000 school districts that is not top heavy with Asians and has to scrape for blacks and Hispanics. <a href="/news/2012/07/thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology-hit-with-civil-rights-discrimination-suit.html">Gary Orfield</a>, of the Civil Rights Project at the University of California-Los Angeles, says the problem is &ldquo;ubiquitous.&rdquo; Fairfax County is like everywhere else.</p>
<p>But let us examine the racial disparities that so distress Miss Hone and Miss Glassman. Given the figures they cite in their complaint, we can calculate that whites are 4.8 times more likely than Hispanics to be admitted to TJ, and are 4.2 times more likely than blacks. Asians, however, are <em>5.4 times more likely than whites to be admitted</em>. If whites are the standard, the most striking problem at TJ appears to be discrimination in favor of Asians. The complaint runs to 16 single-spaced pages and alleges &ldquo;institutional discrimination&rdquo; against blacks and Hispanics, but says nothing about the fact that the incoming class at TJ is nearly two-thirds Asian.</p>
<p>I telephoned Charisse Glassman of the NAACP to ask about Asians. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really speak to that,&rdquo; she said, adding that she hoped the Department of Education will dig up the &ldquo;root causes,&rdquo; of what is happening. I pointed out that she didn&rsquo;t wait for the DOE to discover that black and Hispanic underrepresentation is caused by institutional discrimination, and that by that logic there must be discrimination in favor of Asians. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to get into a back and forth about Asians,&rdquo; she said, and hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Miss Hone did not reply to e-mail, so I called her about Asians, too. &ldquo;We have been really reluctant to comment on that question,&rdquo; she said, adding that she was &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; that anyone should raise it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to blame the children for a flawed system,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help black and Latino kids to blame the Asians.&rdquo; I said I wasn&rsquo;t blaming Asians; I just wanted to know why they are overrepresented. Miss Hone then said that she had been waiting for taxi, which had arrived, asked for my number, and promised to call me back. So far, she has broken that promise.</p>
<p>Well, <em>of course</em>, Miss Glassman doesn&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;speak to&rdquo; the question of Asians, and <em>of course</em>, Miss Hone is &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; if anyone asks about them. Asian success knocks a huge hole in their theory of &ldquo;institutional discrimination.&rdquo; It would be absurd to claim there is institutional discrimination in favor of Asians, so if they are getting into TJ it must be because they are smarter or work harder. But if that&rsquo;s so, could whites be smarter or work harder than blacks and Hispanics? That is forbidden territory, so the enemies of &ldquo;institutional discrimination&rdquo; hope no one talks about Asians, and hang up on anyone who does. What else can they do?</p>
<p>The real question is what the people who run the Fairfax County schools will do. For the first 12 years after its founding in 1985, Thomas Jefferson High School <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/30/AR2010103003460_3.html">lowered standards</a> to let in blacks and Hispanics, but in response to several 1997 federal court decisions on &ldquo;affirmative action,&rdquo; it shut down preferences, and the number of blacks and Hispanics plummeted. After the Supreme Court&rsquo;s University of Michigan <a href="/ar/2003/08/index.html">decisions</a> in 2003 permitting &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; racial preferences, TJ started taking race into consideration again, but the numbers did not change much. Since 2000, the county has run a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/30/AR2010103003460_3.html">Young Scholars</a> program that tries to groom promising elementary-school students for TJ. More than half the &ldquo;young scholars&rdquo; who get special handling are black or Hispanic &mdash; sounds like institutional discrimination to us &mdash; but they still can&rsquo;t make it into TJ.</p>
<p>Fairfax County Public Schools are not yet in real trouble because the Department of Education has just received the papers. A spokesman says the department got <a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/19103218/discrimination-complaint-filed-against-thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology#ixzz21gGMJzSV">7,800</a> complaints last fiscal year, and can&rsquo;t investigate them all. But this would be a splashy case: raging discrimination at what <em>US News and World Report</em> calls the second best public school in the whole country! The Obama administration snorts like a race horse at the faintest whiff of &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; and Fairfax County is a handy target, just across the Potomac. The county can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/07/AR2010010703945.html">barely keep its elementary-school bands and foreign-language immersion programs going</a>, but it would have to spend heaps of money to defend itself against this foolishness.</p>
<p>It takes smart people to teach smart children. The people at TJ, who run a veritable laboratory of applied race differences, have surely heard of Arthur Jensen, Charles Murray, Linda Gottfredson, Amy Wax, or Richard Lynn &mdash; they just don&rsquo;t have the spine to say so. Do they even have the spine to talk about Asians? We&rsquo;ll see when DOE comes calling.</p>

Maybe that&rsquo;s the root of this institutional problem. Â Perhaps the government needs to force smart people to raise the children of stupid people and vice versa. Â Maybe African children should be transferred to Asian homes and Asian children transferred to African homes. Â White people would logically be left out of this process of course because we&rsquo;re in between theÂ extremes ofÂ academic achievement. Â </p>

Â Then 50+ years of de-segregation of the schools and Head Start should have created more intelligent blacks by now but it&rsquo;s the reverse.Â  Now these desperate people think that by forcing blacks to be admitted to top schools, their genetic make-up will somehow change.Â  But in reality, blacks have been forced into elite schools long ago.Â  It is just that a few are still left standing and in need of re-education to conform to lower standards.Â  What a joke!Â  Actually, it only has drawn more scrutiny into racial genetic differences.Â  But what an expensive experiment it has been not just in terms of money but its effect on people&rsquo;s lives and neighborhoods.</p>

How far behind them are we if blacks and their white enablers believe -or a least pretend to believe-that sending an unqualified black to an elite school will transform them into a high achiever?

If the Census and Latinos hide their numbers by declaring it an ethnicity rather than a race when it benefits them, we should force them to be consistent when it hurts them. </p>
<p>If her non-white half &#8220;race&#8221; is Hispanic/Latino, we should inform her that she can&rsquo;t be biracial because Hispanic/Latino is an ethnicity, not a race. She&rsquo;s only &#8220;bi-ethnic&#8221;!</p>

<p>The NAACP&rsquo;s official platform on education policy fraudulently reads: Â </p>
<p><i>Quality public education for African American and Latino students is persistently threatened as a direct result of inequitable school funding.</i></p>
<p>But, according to The Heritage Foundation, based on data from the U.S. Department of Education itself, the assumed funding disparities between racial and ethnic groups do not exist. (See attached image)&hellip;</p>
<p>Heritage reports:</p>
<p><i>Since unequal funding for minority students is largely a myth, it cannot be a valid explanation for racial and ethnic differences in school achievement, and there is little evidence that increasing public spending will close the gaps.</p>
<p>To the extent that funding differences exist at all, they tend to slightly favor lower-performing groups, especially blacks.</i>Â </p>
<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/</a></p>
<p>Also, black and Hispanic schools have been showered with money since 1965 when, as part of the the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, more than a billion dollars was dedicated to upgrade schools attended by children from low-income families.</p>
<p>Charles Murray reports in <i>Real Education</i>:</p>
<p><i>Title I has continued to grow ever since, disposing of $12.7 billion in 2007. The link between Title I, aimed at poor children, and the school achievement of children who are below average in academic ability is indirect but strong.</i></p>
<p><i>Despite being conducted by people who wished the program well, no evaluation of Title I from the 1970s onward has found credible evidence of a significant positive impact on student achievement.</i></p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-112617" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Â Â Â Â  As a white American growing up in Japan, I learned a lot of very valuable lessons about responsibility, dedication, honor and commitment. One of the most valuable lessons I learned was that in order to have something one MUST EARN IT &amp; BE WORTHY of it. Whining and blaming others for ones&rsquo;Â own failures is utterly laughable, childish and ridiculous in the extreme. Such behavior is deserving only of derision and contempt.<br/>
Â Â Â Â  In that regard, let me say that the way many black people act in America is all those things and more. Put simply, if life were a Karate class, they would make no effort, expend no energy in practice, whine about racism and then expect to be awarded a black belt when they only possessed the skills of a beginner.<br/>
Â Â Â Â  I have noticed that for many black Americans, it&rsquo;s all about IMAGE instead of SUBSTANCE. Even though they do not earn the spot and are not worthy of it, they want to have it anyway for the sake of appearance- to stand in the winners circle and receive all that they are unworthy of and then pretend that they are worthy. Furthermore, they want the rest of the world to pretend with them and ignore the glaring reality of their incompetence and unworthiness. If it is not ignored, one is simply &#8220;disrespectin&rsquo; black folks, tryin&rsquo; to make dem look bad and havin&rsquo; an attitude against black people and keepin&rsquo; dem down!&#8221;<br/>
Â Â Â Â  If they are incompetent, they expect tests to be dumbed down so that they can pass with a C even though in reality that C is and F. They expect to be admitted to positions they are unworthy of simply because they exist and have black skin.<br/>
Â Â Â Â  The worse thing is that, even though they act like whiny, spoilt children crying their eyes out because they can&rsquo;t win the foot race, stupid liberals and the p.c. crowd rush to comfort and soothe them as if they were retarded children that must be placated lest they act out and have massive, disruptiveÂ tantrums. Once soothed and pampered, they take their place beside their betters and do not care that they are unworthy as long as they get what they want and can put up a front and pretend they were worthy. The most heinous crime for them seems to beÂ getting &#8220;outed&#8221; and shown up for what they really are.<br/>
Â Â Â Â Â  From my more asian perspective, blacks are clowns, buffoons and idiots. The liberals and p.c. crowd that support their nonsense are just as bad.<br/>

<p>I have some second-hand experience with this sort of thing.Â  I don&rsquo;t think a room full of smart students necessarily needs a teacher as smart as the students.Â  But the teacher needs to be innately intelligent enough, and also one more thing, and this is the most important thing:Â  The teacher needs to be significantly older than the typical HS teacher.</p>
<p>With a classroom of students with IQs of 150, I would rather have the teacher be 50 years old and 120 IQ than be 25 years old and 150 IQ. Of course, a 50-year old 150 IQ teacher would be the best, but 50-year olds with 150 IQs won&rsquo;t be wasting time teaching when they could be making a lot more money doing something else.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-112640" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Â This is not the first time Ms. Hone has worked to deny racial characteristics that discriminate against blacks/Hispanics in favor of whites and Asians.Â  From the article below, she is more concerned about appearances, and &#8220;negative stereotypes&#8221; than confronting reality.</p>
<p>From the on line publication &#8220;Diverse: Issues in Higher Education,&#8221; April 2008:</p>
<p>In suburban Washington, D.C., the Fairfax County School Board (VA.),<br/>
one of the nation&rsquo;s largest school systems, was scheduled to vote<br/>
Thursday night on whether to accept a staff report that concludes that<br/>
Black and Hispanic students received lower marks than White and Asian<br/>
American students because they demonstrate a lack of &ldquo;sound moral<br/>
character and ethical judgment&hellip;,&rdquo; </p>
<p>The report on student behavior&hellip; measured the moral-ethical gap by computing the number of<br/>
third-grade students who received &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; marks on<br/>
report cards in areas such as &ldquo;accepts responsibility,&rdquo; &ldquo;listens to and<br/>
follows directions,&rdquo; &ldquo;respects personal and school property,&rdquo; &ldquo;complies<br/>
with established rules,&rdquo; and &ldquo;follows through on assignments&hellip;&rdquo;Â .</p>
<p>For older students, the report&rsquo;s findings were based on the number of<br/>
state-reported disciplinary infractions, a category where Black and<br/>
Hispanic students fared worse than their White counterparts. The report<br/>
also revealed other gaps among Black and Hispanic students when compared<br/>
to White and Asian students. In skills such as being able to<br/>
&ldquo;contribute effectively within a group dynamic,&rdquo; &ldquo;resolve conflicts&rdquo; and<br/>
&ldquo;make healthy life choices,&rdquo; Whites and Asians outpaced Blacks and<br/>
Hispanics, The Post reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really worry about the impact this type of data could have on the<br/>
spirits of Black and Hispanic children in our school system,&rdquo; said<br/>
Martina Hone, the school board&rsquo;s only Black member. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s damaging and<br/>
feeds into the negative stereotypes about African-Americans and<br/>
Hispanics that some in the mainstream have [and] the defeatist attitudes<br/>
some of our young people have about themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a believer in the scientific method and honest scientific inquiry, wish it could be studied with more rigor and more funding.</p>
<p>But such would require an admission of wrong on the part of ideologues if the results are what we here think they are. Â Problem is - the duckspeakers think the same thing beneath all their obfuscating sophistry. Â They know what the results will be as well as we do&hellip;</p>
<p>Perhaps a surprise here or there, sure, the nature of scientific discovery, but by and large confirmation of most of the ugly old conventional wisdoms regarding race and IQ leading to the conclusion that REALITY is far more racist than most whites. Â </p>

<p>&#8220;You awaken tomorrow to the following headline : &#8220;100% of Scientists Accept HBD as &#8216;Incontrovertible Truth.&rsquo; Politicians Baffled.&#8221;</p>
<p>How should policy change? In education, employment, criminal justice, immigration, foreign policy?Â </p>
<p>People of good will who have crossed the mental fence to HBD belief-help shape the future that is barreling towards us faster than we know.&#8221;<br/>
My favorite quote regarding the modern willing blindness is this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Like so many policy domains, international economic policy in the West has fallen victim to the Late Twentieth Century Delusion: &#8216;People are people.&rsquo; &#8221; Â http://thosewhocansee.blogspot.com/2012/04/building-better-currency-union.html</p>
<p>Would not the world be a better place for all honest people, if races were to acknowledge that we all have our own advantages and disadvantages? Â And to see the struggle for a good life as a race-uplifting individual, not just as the current <b>&#8220;race to the bottom&#8221;?</p>
<p>Everybody says there is a RACE problem, the problem is that we don&rsquo;t understand the CARS.</b></p>

<p>1) The obvious. Blacks are rare among the ranks of hard scientists, and literacy is rare among blacks.</p>

During the 1960s and 1970s one did not need a genius level IQ to realize that the War in Vietnam was tragically futile. It did seem to help. That is why the mostÂ prestigiousÂ universities had the most anti-war activism.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
Unfortunately, many who were radicalized by the War in Vietnam extended their radicalism to other issues where truth was less obvious.Â </p>

I noticed a long time ago that ugly, overweight women (and homosexuals) tend to become busybodies and stir up grief that is none of their business. It&rsquo;s a pre-emptiveÂ  psychological defense mechanism. They know that others will invariably be commenting on their own less-than-desirable characteristics, so they become ultra-sensitive to perceived slights, and make it their life&rsquo;s work to go on a crusade to uncover every imagined injustice out there. These types of people are the high priestesses of P.C., which is a tool of power wielded by the weak, the ugly, and the resentful.</p>

It makes sense, in many ways,, because they are not in demand socially except within groups of other fat/ugly women, or groups who will take just anybody to fill out the ranks. I meet a lot of left-leaning women, and not all are overweight or unattrative. ButÂ in my experience, the most likely by far to be angry, radically feminist, anti-male, pro-nanny stateÂ and arguing on emotion rather than fact are the heavy/uglies. But having an &#8220;excuse&#8221; for being shrewish and irrational is not a valid reason.</p>

Blacks thrive best under a &#8220;strong man&#8221; (dictatorship) type of government while asians subsist under aÂ corrupt feudal lord type of government, enduring abuses &#8220;for the good of the community&#8221;.Â  Jews thrive under a kibbutz (socialist) type of government that borders on marxism (from each according to his abilities, to each according to their needs).Â  We know how that worked out, don&rsquo;t we??However, their social and cultural insularity are to be praised.Â  It&rsquo;s a shame that they do not afford whites the same consideration.<br/>
It is whites that came up with rights, NOT from government, but &#8220;natural rights&#8221; endowed by our Creator . . .<br/>
This projects itself on to behavior.Â  Blacks are big on celebration, but left to their own designs, live in a culture that is thousands of years old, never inventing anything . . .<br/>
Asians thrive on consensus.Â  Individual achievement and invention is frowned upon.Â  The &#8220;group&#8221; is what counts.<br/>
Jews are expert manipulators and businessmen that have &#8220;victimhood&#8221; in their DNA.Â  If they did not have enemies (with good reason) they would have to invent some . . . jews, like blacks like to pull out the victim&#8221; card when they are &#8220;caught&#8221; pulling some shenanigans or losing an argument.<br/>
It is white individuals that have come up with most of the world&rsquo;s inventions, simply because that individualistic streak is ingrained in white DNA . . . the natural mistrust of &#8220;authority&#8221; and desire to live for one&rsquo;s own sake is the driving forceÂ  behind white success (despite being pushed into &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221;.Â  There are still many of us that resist such damaging attitudes . . .</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-112762" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;d like to address some issues here (but, as usual, I&rsquo;m afraid of writing long posts). Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>1. Asians. Forget about IQ, what you have here are -mostly- selected best Asian parents &amp; kids. That&rsquo;s one point. Second- they have retained that zombie-like trait of studying unto suicide. They truly are much, much more devoted to study, because that&rsquo;s their venue of success in life. Whites, on the other hand, are more &#8220;diffuse&#8221;- and I&rsquo;m not talking about wiggers. Gifted White kids may choose- go to some top science schools, try a military career, try showbiz (most of Hollywood&rsquo;s &#8220;stars&#8221; are White &amp; without college degree), try sports, try art, try music, try journalism, try politics, .. &hellip;.everything. Energy of White children is dispersed along the entire spectrum of vast vistas of life. Asians are, expectedly, more represented in academia- and not in the military or Hollywood or among bestseller writers (Clancy, sci fi writers) or top scientists like late Dennis Ritchie.</p>
<p>Asians know they cannot be Leonardo Di Caprio, Clooney, Tom Cruise, Charlie Sheen, Nicole Kidman, Brangelina, &hellip; so they focus on the tangibles.</p>
<p>2. Jews. Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the greatest 20th century philosophers-partly of Jewish extraction- complained about what he (wrongly) perceived as his creative sterility as having something to do with Jewishness: &#8220;Amongs Jews, &#8220;genius&#8221; is found only in the holy man. Even the greatest of Jewish thinkers is no more than talented. (Myself, for instance). I think there is some truth to the idea I only think reproductively. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever invented a single line of thinking. I have always taken one from someone else ..&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s too harsh, but has an element of truth. Judaism is imaginatively refurbishing of other Near Eastern religions; it does not possess its own mythology. Or, in more recent times: enormously influential &amp; erudite Marx was a sort of Talmudist (he was not technically Jewish, but..), reworking other people&rsquo;s ideas (Ricardo, Hegel, Hess, Guizot, &hellip;) into one big synthesis; Freud was a mixture of Janet, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Shakespeare; Einstein&rsquo;s SR was almost completely done in works of Lorentz, Poincare and others, and his GR was actually devised parallel with Hilbert; Feynman&rsquo;s graph approach was invented by Dirac (Feynman said so himself).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to denigrate Jewish creativity in past 150 years in various fields, just- it could flourish only in the broader context of Gentile creativity &amp; frequently- not always- after it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying ALL Asians are dumb, I&rsquo;m saying, White People are better. Â Asians benefit from the same programs all non-whites/women benefit from so for me, if they&rsquo;re smarter, they shouldn&rsquo;t be getting extra points for not being White. Â Treat them the same way White Men are treated.</p>
<p>As for the Jew you quoted, I&rsquo;m the same. Â I&rsquo;ve never come up with any new way of doing anything neither. Â All I know comes from other people both dead and alive but no one from The East. Â Except Ali Sina, my favorite Iranian.</p>

<p>1. Actually there is a lawsuit brewing because white kids are no longer more than half the school.</p>
<p>2. The lawsuit in the article is to have the system prepare all students<br/>
from grade school level, because currently if a child is not enrolled<br/>
in the right school by kindergarten, the chance is that no matter how<br/>
smart they are, they will not have the rigorous curriculum of other<br/>
schools in the same district. </p>
<p>The same schools send children to TJ every year.</p>
<p>Parents from other schools don&rsquo;t learn how far their children are behind until they try to apply.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, most of the clueless parents happen to not be white or Asian.</p>
<p>So the lawsuit is about the lower schools, not against TJ itself.Â  </p>

<p>The &#8220;system&#8221; cannot rearrange nature.Â  At best, this is an argument for segregated schools, where justice is done by giving to each what they deserve.Â  </p>
<p>In reality, what this will mean in practical terms, is that TJ ( whose namesake did not think free blacks and whites could ever live together) will have to start taking black and Hispanic kids, who will either be set up for even greater failure, or they will be shuffled into phony-baloney &#8220;made up&#8221; &#8220;advanced placement&#8221; classes such asÂ  &#8220;The sociological relevance of rap music&#8221;; &#8220;The early black Egyptian Renaissance and its influence on Greek Civilization&#8221;; &#8220;Our famous black Presidents: Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Morgan Freeman&#8221;; and &#8220;Black inventions and recipes from the Super Soaker to Peanut Butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>But more likely this is just another plan to funnel even more white taxpayer money into the coffers of failing black schools, and their black administrator&rsquo;s back pockets.</p>

<p>How Asian immigrants get preferential treatment when starting a business<br/>
Partaking or Taking Over<br/>
by <b>Stephanie Galonska</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known about the Asian ownership of our gas stations, hotels and dunkin&rsquo; donuts for quite some time but I had no idea just how prevalent the &lsquo;Asian ownership&rsquo; was until I drove from Des Moines, Iowa to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania some few years ago.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River had flooded again so I had to take a long detour around I-80 and it was there where I saw it. Imagine my surprise when I walked into an Antique store to ask for directions and saw, to my great dismay, an Indian from India. </p>
<p>Now these weren&rsquo;t Antiques from India, they were American and European Antiques. Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t ask for any directions. The next Town I stopped in only had one gas station and guess what? It was owned by a Chinese person.</p>
<p>Throughout my trip, a pattern was emerging. Everywhere I stopped, no matter how small the Town, an Asian could be found owning something. How did this come to be?</p>
<p>Well, we all know it came slow and long ago but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it came mostly in 1990 when our &ldquo;Leaders&rdquo; enacted IMMACT which gives us this: &ldquo;under the new provisions; increases in the proportion of immigrants coming from Asia, with a corresponding decrease in the numbers from northern and western Europe&rdquo; [1] All one needs to do is look around to see that that&rsquo;s true.</p>

Whites would do well to emulate Jewish cohesiveness and cultural insularity.<br/>
It is a shame that many Jews fight against us whites when we attempt to emulate their cohesiveness and cultural insularity, the reasons for their (and potentially our) success.</p>

<p>1. truly creative Jews are not insular, on the contrary. We should not denigrate their contribution to the world civilization.</p>
<p>2. just, though it may seem unbelievable what I will say- past 40-50 years have been not too fertile re creativity. Sure, the one field that has seen enormous strides is technology. But, fresh, great, gigantic steps &amp; ideas had been exhausted, mostly, with WW2.</p>
<p>In past 40 or so years one cannot find scientists, artists, philosophers, &hellip; who could compete with greatest creative minds in 1880-1920 period.</p>

All would find their level. A black employed at a repetitive rote level position would be happy, that&rsquo;s right, happy in that position at that level since it would fit him and he would fit it. Likewise a white mechanic of average white IQ, 100 - 110, would be able to handle both the initiative such a job required and the fairly complex problems being a mechanic presented him with and would be fulfilled in that position. Professional whites and asians would kick in at IQ 125 - 135. As would most entrepreneurs. It would be a highly productive, wealth creating world. So much so that the blacks and hispanics filling the repetitive rote level positions in the manufacturing, service and agricultural sectors would receive Â pay commensurate with a decent standard of living. Only the Martina Hones would lose their sinecures and actually have to hustle for a living as government in the condition called freedom would shrink to what? a quarter of its present size? a sixth?

<p>Â  You are spot-on about this being a typical Neocon argumentÂ . The blather about IQ and academic achievement does not address the fact that Whites and Asians, whatever their scholastic aptitude-are profoundly different from each other and cannot share a nation and it&rsquo;s resources without one or the other being absorbed, i.e., exterminated. This &#8220;lesser of two (or greater) evils&#8221; approach to our problem can only end up in disaster.Â  the White Man&rsquo;s altruism is a gift that keeps on taking, in our present situation.Â  We must recognize that our innate qualities are the very thing being used to destroy us, and put a stop to it.Â Â And that isn&rsquo;t going to be encouraged in the second-best school in the country-or any other institution under the countrol of the present mob of criminal elites.</p>

<p>On my business trip last week, which was to Columbia, the hotel where we stayed was within walking distance of the station I managed.Â  I walked over to see what was going on, and it was all dot Indians working behind the counter.Â  When I was the GM, all but one of those 41 were white, and most of those were real adults (as in families with children) working gas station jobs because nothing else was available in this &#8220;economy.&#8221;Â  Those kinds of employees are far easier to supervise than teenagers who just want pocket money and have no real concerns or cares.Â  The owner told me that if I had this job about a dozen years ago, I would have had that problem.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the Government all its Minority First Programs, it&rsquo;s us. Â The Government cannot force us to sell our homes and businesses to non-whites. Â If only White People would come together, stand together and only deal with White People, we&rsquo;d be fine. Â Non-whites can&rsquo;t move anywhere or own anything unless someone sells it to them and who does that? Â We do.</p>
<p>As for dealing with teenagers, that&rsquo;s a Blessing &rsquo;cause that would mean that White Men have good jobs and are able to provide for their family.

<p>Ordinarily, you&rsquo;re right.Â  You can hardly sustain a household on quickie mart clerk wages.Â  But I paid the employees who were marred with children a little moreÂ  and told them to keep quiet aboutÂ  it.Â  Though like I said, married with children was most of my supervisees.Â  Also, almost all of them had spouses that had real jobs, and the only reason they worked at the station is because they lost their own &#8220;real&#8221; job and needed to replace their household&rsquo;s second income stream, even if it was a narrower stream.</p>

Anyone else here think success in a white suburban high schools is based on rote memorization and spouting (whatever &#8220;spouting&#8221; is)?</p>

Legit tests generally cost money, and the very few (2 that I can think of) legitimately correlated tests on the internet weren&rsquo;t around until relatively recently. What tests did you take? Just curious.</p>
<p>Your brain was still forming into your early twenties. I would discount the early score. Also discount the score after you studied. You were likely learning to memorize patterns within patterns (pattern solving theoretically can&rsquo;t/shouldn&rsquo;t be learned insofar as testing your IQ goes) - you should test yourself cold.</p>
<p>Obviously, don&rsquo;t take tests when you don&rsquo;t have the stamina to take them. Stamina is part of it. In addition, that eliminates excuses for lower scores. I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that successfully applied problem solving always trumps inherent IQ. Feynman&rsquo;s contributions do outweigh his supposed IQ. The rest can probably be attributed to a true love of Physics. IQ is absolutely meaningless, in the larger scheme,Â  without contribution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Miss Hone,</p>
<p>Regarding your concern for Hispanic kids, according to your own figures,<br/>
white kids are also underrepresented in TJ. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite obvious<br/>
that Asians are vastly overrepresented. In fact Asians are<br/>
overrepresented in ALL gifted programs in the U.S.</p>
<p>I am not Asian, but I don&rsquo;t see this as a problem. If you expect all<br/>
races and ethnic groups to perform equally, then your feud is with<br/>
nature, not the school system.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider that South Africa is the only country in the world whose affirmative action policy favours a majority who also happens to have complete political control. In the rest of the world affirmative action is designed to favour the politically un-represented minority, not the politically strong majority.South Africa now appears to have a system of government whereby the ruling party is elected by the non- contributing majority, who in turn are then rewarded with subsidies, goods and services paid for from the earnings of the contributing minority.&#8221;</p>

The challenge that faces us is when are we going to coalesce as a race and figure out a viable solution, and implement that solution? We all know that it&rsquo;s going to take more than talking and thinking. It&rsquo;s going to take more than voting, because the politicians who put us all in this situation-black as well as white-are more than happy with the status quo, and are in fact working toward making things worse-for us.

<p>Serbs I used to go to school with were not visually different from us. The only peculiarity I can think of is that Serbs, now &amp; before, adore &#8220;exotic&#8221; looks, so their pop stars are excessively tanned &amp; have had Asiatic -looks plastic surgeries. Weird, but they think it&rsquo;s &#8220;sexy&#8221;.</p>

I read his only other comment that he posted on Amren and it was a rant about how white women love non-white men and are having tons of inter-racial babies. I think this dude is a troll of the 1st order.I have never ever met a Serbian (and I have known many) that looked anything even remotely close to a sub-saharan African. Turkish? Possibly. Not black Sub- Saharan African. Black Africans look at their history and see a zero. Therefor they are quick to try and claim they conquered this or conquered that. They do the same with Sicily. Sicily was conquered by North African Arabs. (They were also conquered by theÂ  Vikings years later) To this day African Americans love to bang on about how &#8220;They&#8221; conquered Sicily. Again, many Sicilians do exhibit some minor Arabic features. However black African negro features are completely absent from the gene pool. Modern day SiciliansÂ  like Al Pacino do have some Middle Eastern features, but I see no negro in him.</p>

The blacks&rsquo; latest scam isÂ to demand money from states on the pretense that their schools are not up to par in comparison to whites.Â  For example, the lawsuit in Maryland is demanding at least 2 billion.Â  The blacksÂ there are complaining that whites are not applying to black schools (taking business away from them)Â because it is not on par with white schools therefore under Federal Law they must be granted the $2 billion.Â  They must be kidding!Â  Pathetic and what a joke.</p>

<p>1. US is the world&rsquo;s wealthiest country</p>
<p>2. the language is English, unofficial lingua franca &amp; not a very complex language to learn </p>
<p>3. Asians are invading English-speaking countries (USA, Australia, Canada, ..). Learning German or Russian would be too complicated </p>
<p>4. if you look at most math competitions, the best achievers are overwhelmingly White- US, Russia, Germany, UK, France&hellip;<br/>
From Olympiads for youths to Fields, Abel and Wolf prizes.</p>

The Math or Science Olympiad winners are overwhelmingly white because almost all the participants are overwhelmingly white too!</p>
<p>To an Asian, these competitions are a classic waste of time. And veryÂ  true, these competitions prove nothing, except for a brief confidence building measure. Most of these Olympiad &#8220;winners&#8221; are not very successful in later life, most end up in mediocre jobs or as teachers. Asians on the other hand use their time to study, excel and aim for an employment in a profession, industry or career which will make them quick big bucks!Â </p>
<p>Go to any Olympiad held at a school or university andÂ you will see what I mean.Â  Whites like to explore and tryÂ out different things, but Asiatics have a goal oriented approach. However, based on my observation, Asians in general have a far superior intellect in the fields of Science &amp; Mathematics as compared to whites.

At Lowell 80% of the incoming 9th graders are admitted on the basis of middle school grades and achievement test scores. The other 20% is admitted based on factors such as having lived in public housing, having parents who never finished school, being eligible for the Federal School Lunch program and participating in extracurricular activities. These students are required to attend a summer &#8216;bridging program&#8221; and a strategies for success class during the school year.Â </p>

Their grades do not matter, just the scores on this one test will determine their future. In Japan, students looking to attend high school have to take a test as well to determine whether they go to high school or not since compulsory education in Japan ends at the completion of the ninth grade. Those who do not go to high school go to trade schools or to work, if they can find a job.</p>

High IQ people really indeed don&rsquo;t have much time to discriminate blacks. because we are really having no time to think about them. but until blacks have done something unspeakable. all those sorts of things occurred. t hen people will have some opinions about them. this is not discrimination. these are facts.</p>

There is a widespread misunderstanding that it&rsquo;s &#8220;herbal medicine&#8221;, but it&rsquo;s no such thing. A herb might have been the original active ingredient (chosen because it allegedly causes the same symptoms as whatever it is intended to treat), but it is then diluted so far that there isn&rsquo;t a single molecule left in the solution. There&rsquo;s nothing in homeopathy, so it can&rsquo;t work even in principle, and the evidence does show that it does not work (it&rsquo;s identical to placebo control).<br/>
Gods are indeed not testable, but Creationism is not just the claim that a god exist and created the universe, it is the claim that this happened just as described in a sacred text (there are various degrees of literal and metaphorical interpretations). A god might exist and have used the laws of science to create the universe and everything in it, that position does not contradict the available evidence or current scientific understanding, so disproving Creationist claims does not disprove a god, nor is this intended or even possible.<br/>
Racial egalitarianism is a doctrine that is also without any evidenceÂ  and that contradicts everything we observe in the real world. There not only is no evidence that all races are &#8220;equally gifted&#8221;, there is no possible evolutionary mechanism that could have made this so. Evolution leads to divergence and adaptation to different environmental conditions. It is obvious that races have diverged physically, but they all kept pace intellectually? It&rsquo;s a harebrained idea, an yet it is universally accepted on the Right and the Left, by Liberals and Conservatives, Atheists and Fundamentalists, Evolutionist and Creationists, Christians and Wiccans, Socialists and Free Market libertarians, Gay activists and the Westboro Baptist Church. I can&rsquo;t think of any other idea with that level of universal acceptance, and it&rsquo;s obviously, laughably wrong. I have no explanation for this.</p>

<p>Ideas are no one&rsquo;s monopoly! Every race has great people with original &amp; great ideas. I do respect the gargantuan contributions of Europeans in the past 750Â years to human progress and civilization ushering in the modern age. But, know this, without the priceless gargantuan contributions of Asiatic cultures from the Bronze-Copper-Iron age to the medieval age, and considering the transmission of knowledge from the east into Europe ( during the dark ages) via Arab &amp; Jewish merchants&hellip;.the scientific achievement of the west would not have been completelyÂ possible, despite the Greek legacy.</p>
<p>Post colonial Euro-centric mindset &amp; bias has obfuscated Asian contributions to the west. It is after all said that the victors rewrite history based on their vested agenda.Â Â The fact is even the Greeks are an Iron age culture, the earlier Bronze age Indian, Chinese, Mesopotamian and Nilotian cultures - all either Asiatic or North African, predate the Greeks, but their enormous contributions to human progress is obfuscated. From the earliest concepts of irrigation, cities, water drainage, sewers, complex agriculture, medicine, surgeries, science, mathematics, trade, navigation, concept of universities, music, spiritual life etc which originated in Asia &amp; North Africa ( Nile area) to the recent resurgence of the Asian giants to take over the world in recent times.</p>

<p>This is from a recent article in <i>Business Insider</i>   &mdash;   not known for being conservative.Â  Keynesian economist Paul Kruger is a regular columnist.</p>
<p>The article begins: Â Â Â &#8221;No other field of study has played a bigger role in changing the course of history as mathematics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, mathematicians often get little recognition for their contributions to history.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>20 Mathematicians who Changed the Modern World</b></p>
<p>1. William Playfair, Scottish. Â </p>
<p>2. James Maxwell, Scottish.Â  Einstein kept a framed photo of Maxwell on his desk.</p>
<p>3. Alan Turing, British.Â  Â </p>
<p>4. Pierre-Simon Laplace, French.</p>
<p>5. Charles Babbage, English.</p>
<p>6. Ada Lovelace, English.</p>
<p>7. David Hilbert, German.Â </p>
<p>8. Euclid, ancient Greek. Â </p>
<p>9. Isaac Newton, English.</p>
<p>10. Leibniz, German. Â </p>
<p>11. Lagrange, French.Â </p>
<p>12. Pascal, French.Â </p>
<p>Â 13. von Neumann, Hungarian-American.Â </p>
<p>14. Euler, Swiss.</p>
<p>15. Bernoulli, Swiss.</p>
<p>16. Gauss, German.</p>
<p>17. Fourier, French.</p>
<p>18. von Karman, Jewish-Hungarian</p>
<p>19. Â Ulam,Â  Jewish-Polish.</p>
<p>20.Â  Thomas Bayes, American.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Â Don&rsquo;t see an Asian or East Indians name in the bunch. Â  Wonder Why?</p>

<p>1. 20 is too round a figure, it could be 17 or 28. Kruger&rsquo;s list is also economics-oriented</p>
<p>2. IMO, Playfair is not to be here, only because of economics- he is far from being great mathematician; Bernoulli, Von Karman, Bayes hardly belong in the top 20</p>
<p>3. the very greatest would include, indisputably: Archimedes (Greek), Fibonacci (Italian), Viete (French), Descartes (French), Boole (English), Hamilton (Scotch-Irish), Riemann (German), Cantor (German), Weierstrass (German), Poincare (French), Galois (French), Napier (Scot), Abel (Norwegian), Cauchy (French), ..and maybe 5-10 others.</p>
<p>And Von Neumann was originally Hungarian Jew who became American &amp; Catholic convert. </p>

<p>Einstein called Maxwell a &#8220;genius.&#8221;Â  That coming from Einstein, who turned Newtonian physics on its head, is saying something.Â  Then again, it was an insightful and breakthrough think to take two forces that nobody would have thought related, electricity and magnetism, and prove that they&rsquo;re the same thing.Â  That started the process that will eventually end with a unified particle theory, which I think is a solution waiting for lots of problems,and could be the keystone to the next great wave of human progress and the increases in the standard of living.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-113535" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Nonsense! The Asian Chinese &amp; Indians were explorers much before the Europeans. I will talk about Indians here.</p>
<p>In 985 BC the Â Indian Tamil Cholas mastered the art of navigation and ship building, they sailed accross the Andaman Seas and Indian ocean to civilize and create their foreign territories outside India, this included modern day Thailand, Burma, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.<br/>
http://www.sathiyaseelan.net/2012/01/chola-empire-most-influential-hindu.htmlÂ <br/>
The very word &#8220;Singapore&#8221; is derived from the Tamil word &#8220;Singa-Pura&#8221; which means Lion&rsquo;s City!Â The Tiger &amp; Lion, native fauna of India are the national symbols of the nation.In fact, one of the oldest temples built outside India is the Hindu temple at Ankorwat, Cambodia!Â Â Â </p>
<p>Also, the very word &#8220;navigation&#8221; is derived from the Hindu Sanskrit word &#8220;navigatri&#8221;. This must be the generic Eurocentricism in play whenÂ you so convenientlyÂ deny the significant contributions of the east!Â Â Besides, most of these books are written by westerners, so expect at least a fair amount of Eurocentric bias!Â Â Â </p>

<p>Also, I wonder ifÂ you realize that without the earliest works of medicine, surgery, town building, irrigation and waterways, sewage disposal, mathematics, etc which came from ancient India, China, Mesopotamia and Egypt played an important role in human civilization. Before Pasteur came &#8220;Sashurtha&#8221; - The Father of Surgery, an Indian sage of medicine.<br/>

<p>Or, that the world&rsquo;s oldest university was &#8220;Nalanda&#8221; in ancient India which included students not just from India but also from all over the known world (international students) in 859 AD predating th 2nd oldest Univ - Al Azhar (975 AD) much before the Europeans even grasped the idea of a place for higher learning! The Oldest European univ. is the one at Bologna (1088 AD).<br/>

<p>1. When did you first start hating Whites? </p>
<p>2. Why do Indians fall all over themselves to live in White-created countries?</p>
<p>3. Why can&rsquo;t Indians create socities for themselves like what we Whites have created for ourselves? Why can&rsquo;t &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; Indians clean up the raw sewage in India?</p>
<p>Anti-Whites like you love to come on this forum   &mdash;   using a device and language created by Whites   &mdash;   to tell us how superior you are to us, how much smarter, more educated and brilliant you are -yet you have nothing to back it up!!</p>
<p>The empirical evidence speaks for itself: India is one of THE most polluted, corrupt countries in the world known for massive overpopulation, grinding poverty, filth and human misery. </p>
<p>From CNN:</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s Rivers are Drowning in Pollution!</p>
<p><i>The Indian government has spent half-a-billion dollars trying to clean up Delhi&rsquo;s Yamuna River. It&rsquo;s only gotten worse.</i></p>
<p>From the Chinese Internet:</p>

<p>As for Indian&rsquo;s &ldquo;superior&rdquo; abilities, over and above those of Whites:<br/>
Indian visa holders are consistently associated with high fraud rates that often result in corporate failure. This pattern dates back for years.</p>
<p>In truth, these are not the best and brightest workers. In many cases involving Indian H-1B holders, they have fake degrees and some have only taken a two-week computer class.</p>
<p>Government officials in the Indian town of Bihar recently found 100,000 fake Indian degree certificates. Worse, even legitimate diplomas are useless since the typical Indian degree is from a three-year institution, not four years as required by H-1B standards.Â </p>
<p>The list of failed companies and projects associated with these frauds is huge.</p>
<p>*Quark Inc. was almost destroyed by con man Alluka Kamar until the Board of Directors canned him.</p>
<p>*The Indian outsourcing firm Satyam Computer Services inflated its earnings and assets for years before being caught. The result was a collapse on the Indian stock market similar to Enron&rsquo;s. [Satyam Chief Admits Huge Fraud, by Heather Timmons, New York Times, January 9, 2009]</p>
<p>*In April 2006, Computer Associates CEO Sanjay Kumar was sent to prison for 12 years after he pled guilty to charges including conspiracy, securities fraud and obstruction of justice back. He has been sentenced to 12 years and fined $8 million.</p>
<p>*Windows Vista, produced by Microsoft&rsquo;s 30,000 Indian workers and an utter flop for the company.</p>
<p>*Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit led the company while it lost nearly $19 billion in 2008 and fired 73,000 employees.</p>
<p>Obama made Vivek Kundra, a past shoplifter who claimed a biology degree that he did not earn, Federal Chief Investment Officer. </p>

â¨</p>
<p>But what should you care about bashing Whites? </p>
<p>Your people and culture aren&rsquo;t under threat of extinction, only ours.</p>
<p>I hope more like you come on here. We need MORE &#8220;movements&#8221; like you jumping up and down in public places saying things like &hellip;â¨&#8221;&hellip; I&rsquo;m anti-White because &hellip;.&#8221; It helps to wake up White people and see the true motives of our White-hating enemies.</p>

At least, I provided authentic well reputed evidence to back up my views. The only linkÂ you provide is some nonsense from V-dare, as if, that is an authentic source of information. Seriously,Â you gotta do better than that man!</p>
<p>Also, apart from the lies spouted against Indians,Â you select the worst parts of India and generalize it&hellip;Bihar is considered the Detroit of India - u cannot equate Bihar with the whole of India!<br/>
To make my point clear: Just imagine if I describe America to a foreigner and tell him that America is a huge backward dump of a place based on what I saw in the Hillybillies-Appalachians, dumb rednecks, filthy Detroit, South Central L.A, Harlem, or South Side Chicago. Comprendez-Vous?</p>
<p>India is also THIS:</p>

<p>For some odd reasonÂ you have some nutty conspiracy filled websites which ostracize and even compose blatant lies about non white groups without any actual evidence or if not that, they ignore ALL the good things and contributions of a particular non white group and instead exaggerate the most awful aspects of that society! We could do the same about whites too&hellip;there are many awful things inherent in the white race, BUT, I guess, we are bigger than that&hellip;we cannot stoop to such levels. I have posted links to PROVE that Asian Indians ARE an asset to America - whetherÂ you like it or not! IfÂ you hate us so much, maybeÂ you should tellÂ your lazy white kids to quit with their TVs, video games, crummy American music, drinking, dating, fooling around, drugs and partying hard&hellip;and maybe try and study harder &amp; act like grown ups for a change. My impressions on white, black &amp; hispanic Americans were formed during my universityÂ years at UCLA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niU1E3SSTAMÂ " rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niU1E3SSTAMÂ </a></p>
<p>When I was the head Teacher&rsquo;s Assistant in my university Engineering school at UCLA, I was appalled by the poor knowledge &amp; performance of white kids ( the blacks/ hispanics were much worse) as compared to Asian kids in the engineering school. The Americans did not even know some of the basics and it was the Chinese &amp; Indians international students who had to explain to them all over again! Back in our nations, these white kids would never survive the rigorous standards &amp; discipline needed for the sciences. Also, the professors were to liberal in grading their performance just to pass them. Needless to say, we were either shocked at their ignorance or amused! Its Asian Indians and Orientals who dominate the Science, math and creative competitions. And here is a REAL REPUTABLE link to prove that and NO it&rsquo;s NOT from some wacky racist website, but from an authoritative one instead:</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-113361" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As for &#8220;Joos&#8221; &amp; Asians (mainly slanted, not dot ones), here is a good article about their intermarriage patterns a knowledgeable person knows about already: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/us/studying-and-living-jewish-asian-intermarriage.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/us/studying-and-living-jewish-asian-intermarriage.html?_r=1</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d add just a few rarely said things:</p>
<p>1. it&rsquo;s almost exclusively Jewish males- Asian females phenomenon, not the other way around<br/>
2. children are raised as Jewish or not religious, and almost never Christian, Buddhist, Confucian or some other religious culture<br/>
3. however- they are, generally, not socially accepted as Jews, even if they have all the rituals &amp; religious/ethnic education. Phenotype erases it all.</p>
<p>At the end, a good comment from other article almost all commentators disagreed with -expectedly:<br/>
<a href="http://www.8asians.com/2011/05/18/interracial-marriage-data-can-be-deceptive-for-asian-americans/" rel="nofollow">http://www.8asians.com/2011/05/18/interracial-marriage-data-can-be-deceptive-for-asian-americans/</a><br/>
&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m<br/>
a caucausian female and interracial marriage is just plain wrong.<br/>
Everyone loses. An interracial child is a hiccup on the space time<br/>
continuum&hellip;.they don&rsquo;t relate fully to either parent, and then they<br/>
won&rsquo;t relate to their children because the children will be majority<br/>
something. They won&rsquo;t relate to past history or a definite culture. No<br/>
one should be pushing interracial marriage unless they want everyone in<br/>
the world to be confused, miserable and most importantly Alone. Trust<br/>
me, I&rsquo;m 100% white and I&rsquo;m alone because my dad&rsquo;s brother married an<br/>
asian and I don&rsquo;t have any contact with my half-asian cousins (who btw<br/>
had no children  &mdash;  I wonder why? Hmm&hellip;.), and my mom&rsquo;s side felt the<br/>
need to marry blacks, so I have no relatives on that side. </p>
<p>You have deeper, more honest friendships with relatives and members<br/>
of your own race. Why would you rob people of that deep human<br/>
connection? Some people want more than just friends to go out to the<br/>
club with. </p>

I&rsquo;ve lived among Serbs all my life &amp; some people of Serbian ancestry-not identity- are among my best friends. When I ponder on phenotype, all I can say: more Vlach-type &#8220;darkies&#8221; among Serbs, but not significantly so. You&rsquo;re right about Dinarics who are haplotypically not Slavs nor Celts but something different (in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ca.70% Croats have this haplotype I can&rsquo;t remember the acronym for, as compared with 40% of Bosnian Muslims and 30% Serbs).</p>
<p>Original Serbs in the medieval period and some time later were much more blond &amp; lighter &amp; their 14th century law forbids intermarriage between Serbs and Vlachs mostly on racial, not social ground. But, after Ottoman conquest completed in 1465., many Vlachs assimilated &amp; interbred with &#8220;true Serbs&#8221; due to Eastern Orthodox common heritage. Visually, characteristic Vlach type is Radovan Karadzic (now in the Hague). Other Serbs like Slobodan Milosevic, or assassinated prime minister Zoran Djindjic- a blond guy- were not Vlach types.</p>
<p>Divac is a typical Vlach type, that&rsquo;s for sure; Tesla, probably.</p>
<p>As I said, I don&rsquo;t understand Serbian fascination with tanned, Oriental-looking women. Numerous Serbian folk music females singers had plastic surgeries in order to add a flavor of &#8220;exoticness&#8221;. Here are some examples:<br/>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-113376" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&rsquo;m not a fortune teller. These are old, very old civilizations. But, they didn&rsquo;t show explosions of genius in past 200 years, and the English have opened schooling for them long since.</p>
<p>All I can say is try to deduce something from recent-past 300 yrs, post Enlightenment- history.</p>
<p>Germans are great in abstract thinking &amp; music, less so in visual arts, and their literature is actually philosophy in fiction form, frequently deep &amp; mostly boring. Also, they&rsquo;re big in technology. </p>
<p>British are great in science, also technology- but have an aversion to abstraction. Not systematic. Great in literature, but almost absent in visual arts &amp; serious music.</p>
<p>French are evenly distributed in all fields, but rarely have &#8220;giants&#8221; in selected fields, or are among top 5 in any discipline.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go about others (Americans, Italians, Spanish, Russians, ..)</p>
<p>So, there are definitely national characteristics &amp; national cultures. What about Asians in the US ? They are not Americans - let&rsquo;s be frank- until they lose Asian identity &amp; &#8220;go White&#8221;. Some great minds have been Asian Indians, like Chandrasekhar, but he&rsquo;s something of an exception. IMO, people of some Asian ancestry can be strongly present in creative fields, but only almost completely assimilated ones. Those who retain Asian identity will be good zombies &amp; frustrated paranoiacs.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-113380" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have never been to Montana. I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. That being said, I supposeÂ  the differences between how we see things come in regards to how we define race. </p>
<p>In your post you alluded to &#8220;white girls being indoctrinatedÂ  to like Blacks, Greeks, and Persians&#8221;. I think the misunderstanding that we had is summed up by that quote of yours. If you are considering a Greek/Irish marriage to be inter-racial, then I suppose from your point of view you are correct.</p>
<p>I on the other hand would consider a Greek/Anglo marriage to simply be two white people getting together.Â  I myself am married to a white Arab of Lebanese heritage. She, nor I consider ourselves to be in any &#8220;inter-racial&#8221; relationship.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, I think our respective views on the matter stem from the fact that we have very different definitions of what is &#8220;white&#8221;. </p>
<p>In regards to Sicily. It is a very small Island, however the notion that Sub-Saharan Africans somehow contributed in any significant way to the Sicilian gene pool seems more hype than reality. The Sub-Saharan African genes are very domininant. We can look at places like Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic and see what people who have a significant Afro admixture look like. They look nothing like Sicilians. </p>
<p>Now keep in mind I am not saying that thereÂ  has never ever been a Sub-Saharan African that has reproduced in Sicily. That would be foolish. Sicily, being an Island in the Med has seen many different groups come her way. However saying they are part negro is beyond ridiculous.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-113471" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Too much harping on race, IQ etc. So, for the umpteenth time:</p>
<p>* the only true Americans are white Europeans (or similar phenotype located somewhere else- Armenians, white Christian Arabs, white Hispanics in Argentina and Costa Rica, South Africa,..). They have to be Christians or assimilated Jews (some will cringe at that) or any other religious group who has become atheist &amp; is willing to be absorbed in the dominant cultural pattern: English language &amp; Western civilization. Spanish is a great European tongue, but American nation cannot afford to be torn apart by linguistic dichotomy (cf. Belgium case).</p>
<p>* Blacks are a part of population that may be acculturated in two ways: a) give them 2-3 states &amp; ensure that they all go there (black separatism- Stokely Carmichael), b) softly segregate across the country- the situation in Singapore and Malaysia, where different ethnicities coexist, but not socially mix (much). Just- these are civilized peoples.</p>
<p>* Native Americans I&rsquo;m irrationally fond of. But, these peoples are hopeless. Even indigenous peoples in Siberia (Evenks, Chukchee, Samoyeds, ..) show more initiative. Perhaps, due to low numbers, they will eventually have been swallowed by White majority (high interracial marriages rates )</p>
<p>* Muslims- no way. Only Iranians who are &#8220;Aryans&#8221; &amp; many of them atheists. As a group, they are, due to their religious culture, unassimilable. Imagine Haredi/Hasidic<br/>
Jews on gigantic scale. The only Muslims who are assimilable &amp; with whom I grew up are Bosnian Muslims. They are white &amp; completely secular (booze, rock, sex). But, they&rsquo;re on the way to re-islamization, most of them. It may sound vulgar, but when I was discussing the issue of Islamic modernization with a Muslim friend of mine, I said to him: &#8220;There is one litmus of your acculturation. Can a get a p*ssy of a Muslim girl without converting ? I&rsquo;m not talking about the past, but now.&#8221; EOD.</p>
<p>* Asians, both South (Hindus-dot) and East (slanted). They are &#8220;permanent foreigners&#8221;, as wikipedia states. They could be assimilated-dots, light dots to be more precise- in small numbers; also, small numbers of East Asians with whites suffering from yellow fever. But- these small numbers should go hand in hand with primarily American patriotism &amp; essentially cutting ties with ancestral lands. I&rsquo;m grateful to John Malkovich for some stuff he did for Croatian independence in 1991., but would consider him a national renegade if he pursued this ethnic stuff &amp; renounce all- American ethno-cultural identity &amp; national feeling.</p>
<p>* Hispanics ? Too complicated.</p>
<p>Howgh</p>

It&rsquo;s possible to win a battleÂ but lose a war though.Â  The low profile and clever tacticians such as Tim Wise and Morris Dees whoÂ are overwhelming us with anything but white, have a real chance at accomplishing our genocide.Â  Vengeance attempted.Â  Their intense hatred of whites and Tim Wise&rsquo;s apparent glee at our death (genocide) is almost too much for an antiquated ideology adherence to explain, but more suggestive of a deep and unreasoning vengeance.Â Â The rationale: an eye for an eye, and a genocide for a genocide.Â  The scientific method postulates a theory, and then determines whether it explains observed phenomena.Â  Sure seems to.Â  At this rate the job should be completed inÂ  a few decades.Â  short of nuclear weapons this is the most feasible way to exterminate a billion or so people.Â  So far they are winning.</p>

<p>1. various technical &amp; scientific competitions have, as I&rsquo;ve seen, ca. 60% Asian (South &amp; East) winners &amp; the rest are Caucasians. As I&rsquo;ve said- it&rsquo;s mostly because White kids have more life opportunities &amp; interests, while still patriarchal structure of Asian societies channels energies of Asian immigrant children almost exclusively to study &amp; academia- and not the military, sports, acting, social &amp; humanist sciences etc.<br/>
Besides- it reflects the state of mind of white America. These are not international, but American competitions, virtually all of them. Truly international competition like Math Olympiad has given entirely different results.</p>
<p>2. I&rsquo;m glad for current Indian World Chess champion, but- chess has lost most of its appeal after Kasparov was twice beaten by Deep Blue. In past 20 years I always knew who was the Champ. After Deep Blue, I lost interest &amp; hear for this gifted Indian master for the 1st time. </p>
<p>3. I would disagree about Wise et al. These are fanatics of liberal-multiculturalist dogma, but not out of some genocidal intent, but because they believe their way leads to heaven. Be as it may- they are not half as influential you seem to think: resurgence of normal mindset, due to economic &amp; social troubles, will erase them as if they had never existed. People are aware of this, long time: http://conservativetimes.org/Conservative_Resources/PropositionNation.htm </p>

The fact that he is so happy about our demise suggests he is genocidal.Â Â  Just remember that &#8220;Â an eye for an eye&#8221; emanated from the middle east and is part of the old testament.Â  It has become cultural, but only because of genetic traits.Â  Many of the tribe endlessly ruminate about the holocaustÂ as noted byÂ various authors on these very pages.Â  Their genotype promotes a phenotype that does this.Â  Being theistic or atheistic is irrelevant.Â Â  To suspect thatÂ Tim Wise fancies himself a holocaust avenger is not a stretch.Â  His office is in a Holocaust Museum.Â  The facts support the theory.Â  Holding a grudge for a thousand years is commonplace there.Â  A certain proportion want to get all whites back for their holocaust.Â  We are paying an unreasonable price for something we didn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>This is not to be taken lightly as he speaks at colleges all over the U.S. and publishes anti-White screeds. Â It&rsquo;s beyond imagination to advocate the genocide of a race of people   &mdash;   one that is already endangered as it is, â 7% of the world&rsquo;s population. Â Yet we are asked to &#8220;care for&#8221; genocide in places like Rwanda   &mdash;   and it receives UN recognition and world-wide attention!</p>
<p>Whites genocided in South Africa? Â Well, that&rsquo;s DIFFERENT!! Â (and OK according to the Western Press and the UN).</p>
<p>What would happen if one of us were stand up and screech out anti-black or anti-Jewish diatribes promoting the genocide of the black or Jewish people?</p>

<p>Tim Wise is an anti-White genocidal maniac. Â He speaks all over the U.S. on college campuses preaching and celebrating the end of the White race.<br/>
Â <br/>
Remember this screed?</p>
<p>&#8220;So party while you can, but mind the increasingly loud clock ticking away in the corners of your consciousness.</p>
<p>The clock that reminds you how little time you and yours have left.</p>
<p>Not much more now.</p>
<p>Tick, tock.<br/>
Tick, tock.<br/>
Tick.<br/>
Tock.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Tim Wise, An Open Letter to White people.</p>
<p>To Tim, we &#8220;Whites&#8221; are a social construct, and hence to him we do not exist and because we don&rsquo;t exist then we can be wiped out (he desires this and has said this) for all the bad things we have done. Yes you read that correctly, whites don&rsquo;t exist, but everything bad in this world is because of Whites. And all I can ask is what kind of sick environment did Tim Wise grow up in, what kind of Â sick religion or tradition can create such a man?Â </p>
<p>For promoting and advocating a genocide against Whites, Tim receives lucartive speaking engagements, book deals including book tours, accolades and awards.</p>
<p>Imagine that. Â Receiving praise for advocating the eradication of an entire race of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;sÂ psychopathic; there no other word for it.</p>

<p><b>Despite Murray reserving eight of his 21 categories (including Arabic literature, Indian philosophy, and Chinese visual art) for non-Western arts. Murray, who was a Peace Corp volunteer in Thailand and has half-Asian children, began this project wanting to devote even more attention to Asian accomplishments but found he couldn&rsquo;t justify his predisposition.<b></b></p>
<p>In the sciences, 97 percent of the significant figures and events turned out to be Western. Of the 36 science reference books he drew upon, 28 were published after 1980, by which time historians were desperately searching for non-Westerners to praise. </p>
<p>His methods and lists should become the standards for future research. </p>
<p>Astronomy: Galileo</p>
<p>Biology: Darwin</p>
<p>Physics: Newton and Einstein</p>
<p>Medicine: Pasteurâ¨</p>
<p>Music: Beethoven and Mozart</p>
<p>Literature: Shakespeare</p>
<p>Technology: Edison and Watt</p>
<p>France is tied with Britain and Germany as the leading nation, with Italy fourth.</p>
<p>As a White, I take great pride in what we&rsquo;ve accomplished over the past 2,000 years. Everything the White-haters have, they have because of us. Democracy? That was our invention. Theory of evolution? That was ours too. Computers? Yup, us. Internet? Medicine ? Cars? Space flight? Radio? Television? Classical music? Satellite communication? They only exist because of us.â¨</p>
<p>Maybe these non-Whites should thank us for all that we&rsquo;ve given them instead of attacking us like the spoiled children that they are. Without Europeans the world would be a cruel and barbarous place. We&rsquo;ve given them everything, and they give us nothing in return but impudence and resentment. They need to do us a favor and just STFU.</p>

These rules can be enforced for about a period of time but knowing the history of humans, every now and then, there comes an individual who will question the need for such rules, regardless of his/her indoctrination. It starts from there and it only takes one to start a revolution. Yes, this so called individual can be eliminated if he/she doesn&rsquo;t comply with the rules but then there will be those who&rsquo;ll start to question the death of this particular individual. It&rsquo;ll be history repeating itself again and again. </p>
<p>The one thing that I&rsquo;ve learned from human history is that, we&rsquo;re not meant to be ruled over by other fellow human beings. It has never worked successfully. We can be tamed to some degree but we can also lose the human (sane) side very quickly. Now to enforce the above set of rules efficiently, will be to take away connectivity lines (all modes of transport to non-white nations of course), trade &amp; commerce, no more single preferred communication medium, no sharing/transferring of knowledge, no outside investments, no missionary or philanthropic activities. If we can necessarily execute all that, then yes, I believe we can all be successfully isolated and pursue our own interests but along with it will come a much reduced progress rate. We&rsquo;ll be back to medieval times where human strides happened every 60 to 100 years. Oh well, maybe that&rsquo;s the future or maybe nature disagrees with these principles and it has something better for us. Lets wait and see.</p>

Every regime has their own numbers. But the point is, they&rsquo;re not asking for reparation instead they&rsquo;re moving on. Yes the current state in some of these countries are still deplorable, but it will gradually improve in the next 50 years.

Wasn&rsquo;t it the corporate interests to import more skilled workers from other nations to further the profits, the main reason for relaxing the immigration laws. I doubt it was for cultural enrichment. Giants like Apple, Google don&rsquo;t care about the importance of race or country, they just want to make profits. They&rsquo;re an entity of their own. The only way to beat this is with your money. Invest in things that interest your race and culture. When did you have a temporary decline in your population? Now I know that the life expectancy rates increased in your nations because of better medical treatments. Is that the decline you&rsquo;re talking about? I think the decline started from the 80s, but it only started showing in the 90s.</p>

The Mongolians are the only ones that come to my minds. Now I have not included the Middle-East. There were internal conquests, but that doesn&rsquo;t count when comparing to the settlements in America and Australia.</p>

You say and twist anything to promote your narrative and I get your frustration, but to say their culture values things like stealing, cheating to be the main motto&rsquo;s of life is absurd. Who in here has never tried to cheat, lie or deceive? To me, it&rsquo;s all part of human development. By default, we have both good and evil sides in us. As we grow up, we try to understand which side to go with.</p>

<div id="dsq-comment-message-208978" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I would just like to point out that Asians include South Asians (predominantly Indian Americans) as well. Some (or all) Amren readers are under the impression that the lighter someone&rsquo;s skin color is, the more intelligent and hardworking they are. This is not true. Indian Americans make up 1.5% of the American Population (4.3 million people) and have the lowest proportional rate of welfare, highest educational levels, and highest median incomes of all races in America. Indian Americans are heavily overrepresented in all elite and gifted academic programs throughout the country. India has had high economic growth for the past 20 years and India&rsquo;s GDP is scheduled to overtake the US within the next 30 years. To group Indian Americans with Hispanics and Blacks is a serious mistake that will only make the people doing so look foolish.</p>
