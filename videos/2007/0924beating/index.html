        <p>Length: 38 seconds (1.46 MB)</p>
        <p> <i>Matthew Roy, Virginian-Pilot (Hampton Roads), September 24, 2007</i> </p>
        <p> In the video, the 13-year-old boy struggled to stay on his feet as several youths punched and pushed him from all sides. When he finally went down, the blows didn&rsquo;t cease; he tried to protect his face and head with his hands. As he pleaded for them to stop, he was kicked in the face. </p>
        <p> After the weekend beating in Ocean View, which lasted less than 40 seconds, the boy struggled to his feet, his face bloody. </p>
        <p> The youth, Damin O&rsquo;Rourke, who only recently moved to Norfolk&rsquo;s West Ocean View from North Carolina, was left with bruises and scrapes. Police have identified several assailants &mdash; juveniles who they said could face misdemeanor assault charges. </p>
        <p> {snip} </p>
        <p> Damin is white; his assailants are black. Still, police said in a news release: &ldquo;The assault does not appear to be racially motivated according to information gathered by investigators that we are unable to release.&rdquo; The city&rsquo;s Gang Squad was investigating, said Officer Chris Amos, police spokesman. </p>
        <p> {snip} </p>
        <p> The incident comes on the heels of a march that drew thousands to Jena, La., to protest the treatment of several black youths who were charged with serious crimes in connection with an assault on a white youth. While the circumstances were very different &mdash; protesters in Jena said the young defendants were being treated too harshly &mdash; the national news media, and some international news outlets, nonetheless took an interest in the Norfolk case. </p>
        <p> {snip} </p>
        <p> Damin, a seventh-grader at Northside Middle School, spoke about the beating Monday at his family&rsquo;s home on Hickory Street. He said it started without provocation or warning around 5 p.m. Saturday at Marlow and Orange avenues. </p>
        <p> He said several people attacked him. Most were strangers, he said, although one went to Northside Middle School. </p>
        <p> The attack was videotaped by a youth from the neighborhood who uses a camera to capture images of skateboarding, said Damin, who refused to identify the boy. He said the youth gave his family a copy of what he recorded; they, in turn, released it to news outlets. </p>
        <p> WVEC reported that the youth with the camera had been threatened at school for taping the assault. </p>
        <p> Police acknowledged the Gang Squad was investigating but did not otherwise reveal any theories about what may have been the motive for the assault. </p>
