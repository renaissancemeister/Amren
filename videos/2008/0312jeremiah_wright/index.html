        <p> <b> Transcript </b> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> Who cares about what I&rsquo;m going through? Who cares about what poor people have to put up with? Who cares about what a poor black man has to face every day in a country and a culture controlled by rich white people? </p>
          <p> Somebody missed that  &mdash;  you got nervous, because we got some white members here. I&rsquo;m still in Bible country. I am still in in the text. </p>
          <p> Jesus was a poor, black man who lived in a country and who lived in a culture that was controlled by rich white people. The Romans were rich, the Romans were Italians  &mdash;  which means they were European, which means they were white  &mdash;  and the Romans ran everything in Jesus&rsquo; country. </p>
          <p> It just came to me within the past few weeks, y&rsquo;all, why so many folks are hatin&rsquo; on Barack Obama. He doesn&rsquo;t fit the model: He ain&rsquo;t white, he ain&rsquo;t rich, and he ain&rsquo;t privileged. </p>
          <p> Hillary fits the mold. Europeans fit the mold. Giuliani fits the mold. Rich white men fit the mold. </p>
          <p> Hillary never had a cab whizz past her and not pick her up because her skin was the wrong color. Hillary never had to worry about being pulled over in her car as a black man driving in the wrong [neighborhood] &hellip; </p>
          <p> I am sick of Negroes who just do not get it! </p>
          <p> Hillary was not a black boy raised in a single-parent home. Barack was! Barack knows what it means to be a black man livin&rsquo; in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people! Hillary can never know that! </p>
          <p> Hillary ain&rsquo;t never been called a nigger! Hillary has never had her people defined as non-persons! Hillary ain&rsquo;t had to work twice as hard just to get accepted by the rich white folks who run everything, or to get a passing grade when you know you are smarter than that C student sittin&rsquo; in the White House! </p>
          <p> Ohhh, I am so glad that I got a God who knows what it is to be a poor black man, and in a country and a culture that is controlled by and run by rich white people! </p>
          <p> <b>He taught me</b>, Jesus did, <b>how to love my enemies. Jesus taught me how to love the hell outta my enemies!</b> And not be reduced to their level of hatred, bigotry, and smallmindedness. </p>
          <p> Hillary ain&rsquo;t never had her own people say she wasn&rsquo;t white enough! </p>
          <p> Jesus had his own people sidin&rsquo; with the enemy! </p>
          <p> That&rsquo;s why I love Jesus, y&rsquo;all. He never let their hatred dampen his hope &hellip; </p>
