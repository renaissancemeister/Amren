			<h2>
				Race, Crime, and Numbers
			</h2>
			<p class="byline">
				by Marian Evans

			<p>
				<span class="dropcap">I</span>t is well known that non-whites commit proportionately more crime than whites, but few people have any idea how great the disproportions can be. New York City is an interesting case, since its citizens have a preoccupation with crime and its population is 45.4% white, 24% black, and 23.7% Hispanic. These are the general proportions towards which the nation is said to be moving.
			</p>
			<p>
				The three crimes that New Yorkers probably fear most are murder, rape, and mugging. In 1989, black New Yorkers were 12.3 times more likely than whites to be arrested for murder, and Hispanics were 6.7 times more likely. For all sex offenses (including rape) blacks were 9.5 times more likely to be arrested and Hispanics were 5.4 times more likely. For robbery (mugging), the figures were 17 times for blacks and five times for Hispanics. New York City does not break down convictions by race, but people of different races are convicted in much the same proportions as arrested.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is commonly objected that &ldquo;racist&rdquo; police practices account for figures like these, that police are arresting non-whites for crimes committed by whites. In fact, it is virtually impossible to pin the blame for a mugging or rape on a non-white if a white person actually did it. The victim almost always gets a good enough look at the criminal to know what race he is, so no matter how &ldquo;racist&rdquo; the police were, they couldn&rsquo;t just round someone up and claim they had the perpetrator. If blacks are 17 times more likely than whites to be arrested for robbery, its probably because they are at least 17 times more likely to try it.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is another way to interpret this kind of crime data. Let us imagine that the number of New Yorkers was unchanged but that the city were all black, or all Hispanic, or all white. Let us also imagine that the percentages of people of each race who committed crimes were the same as they are now. In an all-black New York City, there would be about 2&frac12; times as many murders as there are today, more than twice as many sex offenses, and nearly three times as many muggings. Since Hispanics are less crime-prone than blacks, an all-Hispanic New York would not be as dangerous, but crime would still go up: murder by 36%, sex offenses by 30%, while mugging, currently a black specialty, would stay about the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				What if New York City were all white? Muggings would drop by a whopping 84%, murder would drop by 80%, and the sex offense rate would drop by 66%. New York City would be a considerably safer, more civilized place.
