			<h2>
				Self-Esteem at the Checkout Line
			</h2>
			<p class="byline">
				by Marian Evans
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="dropcap2">I</span>n so many ways, California leads the nation. A year ago it broke new ground when it established a state commission to discover how government might promote self-esteem among its citizens. Now, in cooperation with the federal government, California has launched a pilot program that should boost the self-esteem of food stamp recipients and cut administration costs. San Diego County will simply send them checks rather than issue stamps. Excitement for the program seems to have caused a San Diego County official to scramble his syntax. &ldquo;Food stamps [are] a put-down and a humiliating thing to have food stamps in a grocery line,&rdquo; he said. Californians on the dole can now look the checkout lady straight in the eye. Perhaps the resulting surge of self-esteem will propel them off food stamps and into jobs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as we remain to be convinced that a jail term should be agreeable, we doubt that receiving government charity should be altogether agreeable either. But such old-fashioned scruples aside, the old system had an advantage that this one does not: food stamps could be spent only on food.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, since welfare recipients, in a practice known as &ldquo;smoking the check,&rdquo; can choose to spend their allowances on crack cocaine, perhaps the spirit of fairness requires that food stamp recipients should have the same freedom. The residents of the District of Columbia are estimated to spend more money on cocaine than on food and drink, so perhaps the new, spend-&rsquo;em-on-anything &ldquo;food&rdquo; checks are nothing more than a subtle acknowlegement of how times and manners change.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us not, however, be too nostalgic for the disciplines of the past. Indeed, food stamps are meant to be used only for food, but when enough of them are about, the rules begin to bend. In Puerto Rico, for example, where proportionately more people receive food stamps than anywhere else, the little coupons have become a kind of second currency. Even prostitutes, we are told, are willing to price deals in food stamps. We have no data on how payment in food stamps affects the self-esteem of their customers.
