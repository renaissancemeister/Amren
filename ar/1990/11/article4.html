			<h2>
				Children of the Welfare State
			</h2>
			<p class="byline">
				by Erica Blair
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="dropcap">T</span>he American welfare state is evolving into something one might call the nanny state. It not only offers succor and service; it must sometimes wheedle, beg, and even bribe its charges to accept benefits.
			</p>
			<p>
				The state of Rhode Island, for example, has concluded that it is both humane and thrifty to offer free, pre-natal care to pregnant indigent women. Infant disorders can often be corrected most effectively and at least cost while the child is still in the womb. Nevertheless, Rhode Island has discovered that poor women are too disorganized to come in for medical care even if it is free. The authorities have decided to tempt them into clinics by entering them in a lottery. Any woman who keeps all her appointments through the first trimester will be eligible for a $500 prize.
			</p>
			<p>
				Washington (DC) also offers free, pre-natal care for any woman whose annual family income is less than $20,000. There are convenient evening hours and child care is available. The city has launched a &ldquo;Better Babies&rdquo; campaign to advertise health services through billboards, television, and radio. But still the pregnant women will not come. In desperation, the city sends out MOM (Maternity Outreach Mobile) vans that prowl poor neighborhoods for pregnant women, remind them of their appointments and take them to clinics if they don&rsquo;t have transportation. Despite all this, Washington has the highest infant mortality rate in the nation. A black baby born in the District of Columbia is more likely to die before the age of one than a baby born in North Korea or Bulgaria.

				Some people would like to prevent some of these pregnancies. In Caroline County (MD), an official has suggested that teenage girls be paid a dollar a day so long as they avoid pregnancy. The payments would be made to girls who have already had one child and who are therefore likely to have another. In 1989, fourteen percent of the teenage girls attending schools in Caroline County were pregnant. More than two thirds of these were pregnant with their second child. Of course, if payments are made only to girls who have already had one child, some girls will get pregnant just to get into the program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute has a different idea. She proposes that underclass children should be given a $5,000 reward if they manage to graduate from high school without bearing or fathering a child. The $5,000 would be in the form of a voucher that could be spent only on college or vocational training.
			</p>
			<p>
				LeMoyne-Owen College already offers tuition-free admission to young black men who attend 14 Saturday-afternoon sessions on campus, get a C average in high school, and graduate without becoming fathers. The State of Rhode Island likewise has just started a $10 million program to offer free college tuition to any of today&rsquo;s third graders who manage to graduate from high school without going on drugs or having a child.
			</p>
			<p>
				But what if babies are born after all? There are nanny-state programs for them, too. One largely-black school in Detroit holds a lottery with a $100 prize to coax students into handing in class registrations. Maryland, the state that is considering paying girls not to get pregnant, recently voted to require all school districts to come up with reward plans to boost attendance. Thus, at Thomas Johnson High School in Frederick (MD), any student who has missed fewer than four days of school in one year gets to enter a lottery for one thousand dollars.
			</p>
			<p>
				All these programs have something in common. They recognize that America has a growing class of people who will not be even minimally responsible unless they are bribed. What does it say about us when citizens look to the state, not only for services paid for by others, but for rewards for using them?
			</p>
			<p>
				The Roman empire was already in decline by the time the satirist Juvenal wrote that the anxieties of the people should be limited to two things: bread and circuses. The great days of the empire were long over when Romans looked to the state for food and entertainment.
