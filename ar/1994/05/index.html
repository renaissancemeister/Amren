					How an all-American city became a beachhead for the third world. 
				</p>
				<p class="byline">
					by Derrick Anderson and <a href="https://archive.jaredtaylor.org/">Samuel Taylor</a> 
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="dropcap">T</span>wo facts  &mdash;  just two  &mdash;  explain almost everything about Miami: In 1960, the city was 90 percent white; by 1990 it was only ten percent white. Virtually everything else about Miami today  &mdash;  crime, poverty, race riots, cultural decay, third-world squalor  &mdash;  follows from this astonishing change in population. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To be sure, it is important to understand the mix of people who displaced whites. Cubans, especially those who arrived first, have had a very different effect from that of Haitians or Nicaraguans. However, no city could show more clearly how dependent upon race and ethnicity are a city&rsquo;s character and civility. No city could show more clearly that large-scale displacement of whites marks the end of everything commonly thought of as &ldquo;American.&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Miami is one of the bellwethers for the nation that will result if the silent invasion from the third world continues. It is therefore important to know what has happened to the city and why. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>First Came the Cubans</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cubans are now the dominant group in a city that is 63 percent Hispanic and 27 percent black. Even Dade County, which surrounds Miami, is about 50 percent Hispanic and 21 percent black, with whites making up no more than 29 percent of the population. Aside from a few quickly-shrinking enclaves of white influence, Cubans control business, politics and culture. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled to Miami after Fidel Castro&rsquo;s victory in late 1958, but they did not come simply because it was near by. Florida and Cuba have connections that are centuries old, and the post-Castro migration was only part of a long history. 
				</p>
				<p>
					From the earliest times, imperial Spain had ruled Florida and Cuba under a single administration. There was no political border between the two territories until Andrew Jackson conquered Florida, and the United States annexed it in 1821. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Even before the city of Miami was founded in 1896, the area had long played a part in the ructions of Cuba&rsquo;s tropical politics. The South Florida coast was an important supply route for Cubans fighting Spanish colonial rule, and the smugglers and gun runners were largely unmolested by Americans intent on building a vacation resort. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Spanish-American war brought American-imposed stability to Cuba, but once the country tried governing itself, it reverted to <i>opera buffa</i> politics. In his 1917 essay, <i>Gore in the Caribbees,</i> H.L. Mencken describes the &ldquo;Latin exuberance&rdquo; of a failed revolution. &ldquo;It was an exhilarating show,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;but full of strangeness for a Nordic.&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Revolutions routinely deposited refugees and counter-revolutionaries in Miami, and former exiles would sail back to Cuba with the next violent change in government. In 1933, for example, Gerardo Machado was overthrown and Miami teemed with his henchmen. In 1952, Fulgencio Batista staged a coup and his predecessor, Carlos Prio, packed his bags for Miami. In 1958, it was Batista&rsquo;s turn to move north. All three are buried in Miami, where residents got used to itinerant dictators and their hangers-on. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The immediate effect of the Castro take-over was to <i>reduce</i> the number of Cubans living in Miami. Many had been scheming against Batista and streamed home in the wake of Mr. Castro&rsquo;s victory. They streamed back to Miami when Mr. Castro began to build the workers&rsquo; paradise. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The real exodus from Cuba did not start until a year or two after the revolution, but when it came, Miami was the obvious destination. During the Prio and Batista years, even middle-class Cubans took annual vacations in Miami, and after airplane service began it was fashionable for rich Cubans to take one-day shopping trips to Florida. The Cuban upper classes escaped to a familiar and comfortable refuge. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At first, Miami&rsquo;s whites ignored the post-Castro rush, confident that like all previous waves of political casualties, it would wash out again with the next coup. Moreover, the first crop of Cubans was the wealthy, well-educated white elite who spoke English and slipped easily into Miami society. However, by 1965, 210,000 Cubans had come to Miami, and by 1973 another 340,000 had boarded the twice-daily &ldquo;freedom flights&rdquo; for Florida. The quality of immigrants steadily declined, though few Cuban blacks and mulattoes had yet to come north. 
				</p>

				<p>
					During this period the <i>Miami Herald</i> still reflected the views of whites, and its editorials echoed rising alarm over the alien invasion. However, Cubans fleeing from communism made first-rate cold-war propaganda, and the federal government flouted the wishes of whites by welcoming the Cubans as refugees. It was Mr. Castro who finally stopped the &ldquo;freedom flights&rdquo; in 1973, but Miami&rsquo;s transformation was well under way. The first wave of Cubans came to plot counter-revolution in the hope of going back home; later waves expected to stay.

				<p>
					Cubans quickly established a distinct community. They came not only with a common nationality, but with a fierce anti-communism that set them apart from the soft liberalism of America. They employed and did business with each other, continuing relations that had been established for years. Some businesses simply moved across the Florida Straits. The Caballero Funeral Home, for example, advertises that it was founded in 1858, at a time when Miami did not exist. It was founded in Havana. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Many entrepreneurs had scant regard for American legalities or customs, and they brought with them a corner-cutting, under-the-table mentality that still characterizes Miami. However, Cubans were scrupulous in their relations with each other because a violation of trust meant exclusion from the community. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that well-off businessmen had come first made things much easier for the later arrivals. Cane-cutters just off the plane were grateful for any kind of work, and were both loyal workers and customers for Cuban businesses. At the same time, perpetually rocky politics in Latin America sent north a steady flow of flight capital. Naturally, it went to Miami, where nervous Argentines and Colombians could count on fellow Hispanics to invest their nest eggs in solid American banks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					What was the effect of the Cuban presence on the Miami labor market? One of the few &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; criticisms of non-white immigration is that it displaces blacks, and it is widely maintained that this happened in Miami. In fact, it was whites who were replaced. The garment industry, for example, was 94 percent white in 1960, but by 1980, it was 83 percent Hispanic. Black participation in the industry held steady at 5-7 percent. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Likewise, in the hotel industry, when Cuban participation went from 18 percent to 40 percent between 1970 and 1980, this advance was entirely at the expense of whites. During the same period, blacks <i>increased</i> their participation from 14 to 23 percent  &mdash;  likewise at the expense of whites, who saw their participation cut in half, from 68 to 34 percent. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The professions saw the same trend. From 1970 to 1980, black participation nearly doubled from seven to 13 percent. Cuban participation grew even faster but, again, the only group that saw its numbers decline was whites. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This was not because whites could not compete for jobs, but because they simply moved away. The arriving Cubans naturally steered clear of black neighborhoods and moved in among whites. This was the obvious choice for the first group of well-to-do, light-skinned Cubans, and when poorer immigrants began to arrive, they settled around the margins of already-established Cuban areas. As neighborhoods became unrecognizable and unintelligible, whites moved away. The departure of hundreds of thousands of citizens in the face of an alien onslaught is the great, unrecognized tragedy of Southern Florida. Blacks, whose uninviting neighborhoods were shunned even by poor Cubans, were largely unaffected. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>1980: Annus Mirabilis</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					By 1980, it was clear that Miami was sliding out of the European-American orbit, but several events in that remarkable year confirmed it. One was what became known as the Mariel boatlift. After a few Cubans successfully broke Mr. Castro&rsquo;s travel ban and shipped out to Miami from the port of Mariel, Cuban authorities decided to let anyone leave who wanted to. Miami Cubans joyfully spent millions of dollars chartering boats in the hope of freeing relatives, but most of the passengers turned out to be strangers. Cuba made no secret that it was emptying prisons and mental hospitals onto the waiting boats. &ldquo;Those that are leaving from Mariel,&rdquo; explained Mr. Castro, &ldquo;are the scum of the country  &mdash;  antisocials, homosexuals, drug addicts, and gamblers, who are welcome to leave Cuba if any country will have them.&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					During 1980, 125,000 <i>Marielitos</i> floated across to Miami, 45 percent of them with criminal records. They unleashed an unprecedented crime wave, including as many as six airplane hijackings to Cuba in one week. Even the most staunchly anti-Castro Cubans began to realize that accepting Mr. Castro&rsquo;s scum was a mistake. &ldquo;The <i>Marielitos</i> are mostly black and mulattoes of a color I never saw or believed existed in Cuba,&rdquo; marveled one Cuban-American official. 
				</p>
				<p>
					President Jimmy Carter, ever unmindful of the damage he was doing the country, welcomed the boatlift as yet another testimonial to America&rsquo;s greatness. He stopped letting the boats land only after Miami Cubans themselves  &mdash;  disgusted with Mariel dross  &mdash;  told him to. 
				</p>

				<p>
					1980 was also marked by the beginning of what has come to be almost a biennial Miami ritual: black riots. A black man had died at the hands of police under questionable circumstances, but a jury concluded no crime had been committed. Blacks reacted with several days of riot, arson and murder, during which they deliberately attacked whites. Eight whites were lynched in a variety of colorful ways  &mdash;  set afire in their cars, beaten with concrete blocks, stabbed, shot, run over  &mdash;  and scores barely escaped with their lives. The Dade County court house was one of many buildings put to the torch in an orgy of destruction that left $80 million in property damage. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Just to top off the year, 1980 also saw a rush of Haitian boat people. About 60,000 paddled in between 1977 and 1981, and the largest number came at the same time as the Mariel boatlift. This was no coincidence. A government that was rejoicing in the arrival of criminals and mental patients could hardly turn away able-bodied Haitians without being accused of racism. As it happened, Haitians were bringing their own peculiar scourges: AIDS and tuberculosis. 
				</p>
				<p>
					They brought incongruity too. Some boats landed on exclusive beaches, where sun-bathers gaped as starving, ragged blacks shuffled ashore. In one famous incident, 20 bloated corpses from a Haitian shipwreck drifted onto the powdery white sand behind expensive condominiums. Whites could be forgiven for thinking that civilization was coming to an end. 
				</p>
				<p>
					How did they react? In their civilized and utterly ineffectual way, Dade County residents voted by a huge majority to prohibit the county from conducting business or funding activities in any language but English. In that fateful year of 1980, the forces of cohesion could manage no more than this  &mdash;  and even this was worse than nothing. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cubans decided that the &ldquo;anti-bilingual ordinance&rdquo; was a huge insult to them. Until then, they had concentrated their political energy on undermining Fidel Castro. Now that whites (and blacks) had mounted a feeble attempt to keep Miami from spinning completely off into the Caribbean, Cubans resolved to remake the city even more explicitly in their own image. They began to promote Hispanic causes not just in Cuba but in America as well. They became U.S. citizens and ran for office. Thousands who had never bothered with naturalization mouthed the words of the oath of citizenship and started voting for fellow Cubans.

					By the time of the Falkland Islands war in 1982, Cubans and other Hispanics were not at all inhibited about expressing partisan, ethnic interests. Even Cuban-Americans who had fought with U.S. forces in Vietnam helped raise money for the Argentines and joined rallies denouncing Britain&rsquo;s campaign to retake the islands. Whites supported the British, out of cultural affinity and respect for international law. Many were startled by the fierce, ethnic solidarity that drove fellow &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; to support the Argentine invasion. However, it was during the controversy over Nicaraguan immigrants that Miami&rsquo;s Cubans clearly demonstrated their power to make national policy. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>After Somoza</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Just as Cuba had done, Central American countries had long used Miami as a staging area for the series of farces that passed for politics. Thus, when Anastasio Somoza felt support disappearing in 1978, he quietly bought a $575,000 house in Miami. The next year, the Sandinistas persuaded him to go live in it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Nicaraguan exodus that then followed was like the Cuban exodus writ small. The &ldquo;capitalists&rdquo; were the first to abandon ship, and by the early 1980s, Miami had a Nicaraguan-American Bankers Association. Ordinary Nicaraguans did not start coming to Miami in large numbers until the mid-1980s, as the Contra war wound down. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Republican administrations did not welcome these newcomers the way Democrats had welcomed Cubans. Ronald Reagan and George Bush thought the best way to fight communism was for Nicaraguans to stay home and dust it up with the Sandinistas. The government treated the new flood as illegal aliens and tried to 
					<br>
					stop it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cubans felt otherwise. They sympathized with their brother Latinos, who were fleeing a familiar sort of tyranny. Also, Nicaraguans made good, grateful stoop workers in the fields and seamstresses in the sweatshops. The Cubans of Miami rose up against the deportation policy. At first, they simply defied it. Any Nicaraguan who could make it to the city was swept into a Hispanic network that immigration officials could not penetrate. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Miami whites were actually talking angrily about the need to control American borders, and the federal government&rsquo;s official position was to deport Nicaraguans  &mdash;  to no avail. In 1986, the Justice Department threw up its hands and announced that no more Nicaraguans would be deported. All asylum seekers would get temporary work permits while their cases were reviewed. Of course, this only increased the flow, and by the second half of 1988, 5,000 Nicaraguans a month were filing asylum claims. The Cubans had won and the nation had lost. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Illiterate Nicaraguans quickly became a welfare burden. Clinics suddenly found they were treating more Nicaraguans than anyone else. Schools were swamped with yet more children who spoke no English. As usual, the city gave way. There is now a Ruben Dario Street and a Ruben Dario Middle School, both named after Nicaragua&rsquo;s best-known poet. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It was about this time that the <i>Miami Herald</i> defected to the other side. Cubans were incensed that it had run editorials in favor of deporting Nicaraguans and in October, 1987, they bought a full-page ad in the <i>Herald</i> to denounce the newspaper. There was talk of boycotts, and spineless white editors quickly capitulated. Whites were leaving town anyway, they reasoned, and Hispanics were not going to read a paper that didn&rsquo;t promote their interests. Before long, the <i>Herald</i> was writing cheerily that Nicaraguans would make wonderful contributions to the city just as Cubans had. These days, its publisher, David Lawrence, urges whites to learn foreign languages and looks forward to hearing <i>The Star Spangled Banner</i> sung in Haitian Creole. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Whites continued to put up ineffectual resistance. In 1988, a state constitutional amendment to make English the official language of Florida passed with 84 percent of the vote. One can only assume that a majority of that size means that whites were overwhelming opposed to nonwhite immigration, easy citizenship, liberal asylum laws, welfare for non-citizens, and all the other measures that make a mockery of citizenship and turn whites into refugees in their own land. But of course, they were afraid to defend their interests as <i>whites</i> and hung their forlorn hopes on symbolic gestures. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Just how symbolic they were was shown last year, when a newly confident Cuban power structure overturned Dade County&rsquo;s English-only ordinance. Miami is now free to conduct official business in Spanish. As the former mayor of Miami, Maurice Ferre, has pointed out, &ldquo;Anglos&rdquo; have a choice: They can learn Spanish or leave. It is hard to think of a more arrogant, thankless attitude to the country that has welcomed newcomers, but the <i>Herald,</i> glorying in defeat, purred delightedly when the English-only rule was voted down.

					Although thousands of Jamaicans, Trinidadians, and Tobagoans have moved to Miami in recent decades, Haitians have set the tone for black immigration. They have not always gotten on well with American blacks. The mulatto elite tends to be responsible and hard-working and to look down on American ghetto-dwellers. For the most part, though, the neighborhood of Little Haiti looks like big Haiti: rows of clapped out buildings sitting in piles of trash. Of course, there is a public school named for Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture, one of the leaders of the Haitian slave revolt against France that turned into a race war. As in so many other Miami neighborhoods, an occasional patrol car is the only reminder that this is, theoretically, the United States. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Haitian children have quickly acculturated  &mdash;  to the black sub-culture. In the early 1980s, when they first started appearing in schools, American blacks taunted them and beat them up because of their accents. Haitian children quickly learned black slang, music, and misbehavior and all the anti-white clich&eacute;s that nourish black resentment. Worried Haitian parents watch helplessly as their children slip into the despised American underclass. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Blacks, whether Haitian or American, have never had good relations with Cubans. Cubans generally ignore blacks, leaving the rituals of propitiation to whites. After the 1980 race riot, it was whites who raised $7 million for a Business Assistance Center to give money to black companies. Later the center raised another $8.3 million, but much of the money was wasted on black shysters, and the average rioter got nothing. Neither the city&rsquo;s black set-aside program, which ran from 1982 to 1990, nor a series of enterprise zones and tax holidays in black areas have alleviated the squalor. Every riot brings a new infusion of tribute money, but nothing changes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Puerto Ricans  &mdash;  four percent of Miami&rsquo;s population and mostly poor  &mdash;  have noticed this municipal largesse and decided to get some, too. In 1990, they started their own little riot in the Wynwood neighborhood. &ldquo;The other people, the black people, this is how they did it, and it worked,&rdquo; explained a 17-year-old girl rioter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the invisible community,&rdquo; said Florida&rsquo;s representative of the National Puerto Rican Forum; &ldquo;[T]his is the only way we have gotten recognition.&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is mainly blacks, though, who continue to burn down their neighborhoods and then blame racism for it. They have seen Cubans, Nicaraguans, and even Haitians pass them by, and now that Cubans largely run the city, it must be Cuban racism that makes them fail. This raises an earnestly debated question: Were Cubans always vicious racists or did they learn from whites? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cubans particularly angered blacks when they snubbed Nelson Mandela during a visit in 1990. Miami officials were among the few people in America with enough backbone to denounce Mr. Mandela as the communist admirer of Mr. Castro that he was. This was an unspeakable crime in the eyes of blacks, who started a campaign to drive convention business from the city. Blacks, who neither study Spanish nor have the initiative to move away, increasingly resent the Hispanic takeover of what they thought was an American city. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, racial animus got official recognition from an appeals court judge. In 1989, Colombian-born policeman William Lozano killed two black criminals who were about to run him down on a motorcycle. After the usual two days of riot and arson, Mr. Lozano was convicted of manslaughter. In 1991, the appellate court threw out the conviction on the grounds that Miami was so racially divided it could not possibly have given him a fair trial: Blacks were ready to lynch him, while Hispanics paid his legal fees  &mdash;  contributing as much as $150,000 after a single radio appearance. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Racial cleavage got another official boost in 1992, when a federal judge outlawed Dade County&rsquo;s decades-old system of county-wide elections for commissioners, and carved out 13 separate districts, each with a solid racial majority. Commissioners, the great majority of whom are Hispanic, can now officially and openly represent their co-racialists. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Capital of the Caribbean</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					So what is life like today in the Capital of the Caribbean or the City of the Future as boosters like to call it? It is possible, in the beautiful neighborhoods of Coral Gables, Old Cutler Road, and Pinecrest in south Dade County where wealthy whites live, still to believe oneself in paradise. It is possible to glide from half-acre estate to private club to private school, and remain in a world that is overwhelmingly white and civilized. Most Miami whites even think they &ldquo;celebrate diversity.&rdquo; They speak a few words of Spanish, and they know some light-skinned Latinos with impeccable manners who appear to fit into their social class. Only dimly do whites, in their golden enclaves, sense the rising tide of aliens  &mdash;  aliens who hate them because they are rich, and despise them because they are weak.

					There are over 150 square miles of metropolitan Dade County that simply no longer exist for whites. Here live the nearly 60 percent of county residents who do not speak English at home. Here live the half of the population of Miami and of Sweetwater that were not even born in the United States. Here live the one in ten county residents who are illegal aliens. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Every month, another 1000 foreign-born students enroll in the county&rsquo;s schools. This year, there are more than 16,000 illegal students in the system with a legal right to an education, which will cost the county $68 million. This does not include &ldquo;bilingual&rdquo; education costs such as the salaries of 40 Creole-speaking teachers. It is difficult to teach this mix of school children and many a career has foundered in the attempt. The Miami school district had four different school superintendents during a 14 month period in 1990 and 1991. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the Haitians, Cubans, and Central Americans who keep coming have nothing to offer an employer, Miami is poor. During the 1980s, the typical Florida family enjoyed a 12 percent gain in income. In the city of Miami, the typical family lost 12 percent. Half of the children under five live in poverty, and the number of poor people rose during the decade from 25 percent to 33 percent. One in eight dwellings in the city is so run down it should be demolished. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A growing problem for Miami is people who are both poor and old. Many former construction workers and sewing machine operators spent their lives in the underground Hispanic economy. They have no retirement plans, no social security accounts, and no savings. The taxpayer will have to keep them in their old age. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The taxpayer also heals the sick. In 1992, Jackson Memorial Hospital alone staggered under an unpaid immigrant medical bill of $93 million. Since 1990, Cubans have stiffed the hospital for $40 million, Haitians for $26 million and Nicaraguans for $22 million. Spongers from virtually every Caribbean and South American country have run up bills, including $700,000 for Guyanese, of all people. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Florida leads the nation in heterosexual transmission of AIDS, and today one in every 40 Dade County residents is infected. Since each AIDS patient costs about $85,000 from diagnosis to death, the county can expect to spend something over $3 billion on the disease during the next decade. Many of the dead will be women, so after New York City and Newark, New Jersey, Dade County is likely to have more AIDS orphans by the year 2000 than anywhere else in the country.

					Miami has also become a center for the practice of a quaint &ldquo;religion&rdquo; called Santeria, which lower-class Cubans brought with them. Best known for ritual animal sacrifice, Santeria combines the outlandish beliefs of African animism with equally outlandish borrowings from Catholicism. One common ritual for driving evil spirits out of a house is to cut off a chicken&rsquo;s head and drink the blood straight from the chicken. Miamians used to be arrested for this sort of thing, and for hacking up goats, sheep, dogs, turtles, snakes, and roosters during their worship services, but in 1993 the Supreme Court decided that Santerian rites are part of a Constitutionally protected religion. Sacrifices are now undisturbed, and children are excused from school to attend them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Top of the List</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					However, it is crime that is the most piquant spice that &ldquo;cultural enrichment&rdquo; adds to the Miami stew. Some people still remember the 1950s, when Miami was a white city and people did not think of locking their doors even when they went on vacation. Now, they live behind steel bars, triple dead bolts, and electronic alarm systems. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, Dade County has had the highest crime rate of any American metropolitan area. Each year, the county reports 12.3 serious, FBI index crimes for every 100 inhabitants, which puts it well ahead of San Antonio, Texas, which is next with 9.5 for every one hundred. The county&rsquo;s crime rate is fully 45 percent higher than that of New York City. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Miami leads the nation in several crimes that are not even part of the FBI&rsquo;s index. In 1990, more than 770 people were indicted for drug smuggling, 200 more than in the New York/New Jersey area, which came in second. Miami is also America&rsquo;s favorite distribution point for counterfeit money; $50,000 in bogus bills go into circulation every week. Much of it is printed in Latin America and comes in with drugs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Miami is also back to its old business of gun running, and may well lead the world in this trade. Weapons obtained in Florida were used to assassinate three candidates in Columbia&rsquo;s 1989 presidential election and to stage a failed Islamic coup in Trinidad in 1990. Both the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have their largest offices in Miami. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Violent crime has increased by more than 82 percent in the last ten years, which helps explain why private security is a booming businesses. Miami was one of the first cities in America to wall off entire residential areas and hire off-duty cops to patrol them. Criminals are piling into the jails at such a rate the judges order their release because of crowding. Even the most dangerous convicts often serve no more than 30 percent of their sentences. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the city&rsquo;s highest-profile crimes have been against tourists. In a period of just a few months in 1993 and 1994, black thugs killed four European tourists, and Miami temporarily stopped advertising itself as a vacation spot. A favorite crime against tourists is to smash their car windows and grab everything in sight. In 1990, there were 4,040 roadside robberies, or 11 every day. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1991, the Dade County Commission tried to protect tourists by making it harder for robbers to tell which cars are rented. A new law forbids rental of a car with company stickers on it, so when Miami rental agencies turn around one-way cars from other cities, they have to scrape off all the advertising. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Miamians have gone numb to violence and degeneracy, and some even find entertainment in it. On one occasion, police found themselves surrounded by a crowd of 500 curious onlookers as they prepared to remove two decomposing corpses from the trunk of a gold-colored Cadillac. People spent hours waiting for the spectacle to begin, sipping lemonade, bouncing children on their shoulders, and sniffing the odor of rotting flesh. The police tried to block the view with vans, but people crawled under them. Others hurried home for binoculars and stood on their own cars for a better look. There was no sense of horror; just the happy buzz of a crowd waiting for a good time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Andrew Strikes</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1992, Miami got an extra dose of third-world bad luck that was a perfect metaphor for the past 30 years: Hurricane Andrew blew in from the south, just like the immigrants, and wrecked 80,000 homes and 82,000 businesses. One hundred sixty thousand shelterless people were left staring at $20 billion worth of property damage.

					Miami promptly ceased to be the capital of the Caribbean. Venezuela sent no utility repairmen to help the city get back on its feet; they came from South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. No Cuban or Dominican or Nicaraguan churches sent food or set up soup kitchens; the Baptists and Presbyterians took care of that. And, of course, it was the American Red Cross, the U.S. Army, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Salvation Army that came to the rescue. Oddly, no one complained that the rescuers spoke only English. When it came time to staff the We Will Rebuild Committee, who should step forward but the remnants of the old &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; elite. &ldquo;We have no tradition of philanthropy,&rdquo; mumbled the rest.

					Joseph Walker is a black playwright who won Tony and Obie awards for his play, &ldquo;River Niger.&rdquo; He is also chairmen of the theater department of the Camden, New Jersey campus of Rutgers University, and is reportedly trying to cleanse the department of inferiors. Thomas Behrens, who is white, was recently removed by Mr. Walker from his job as the department&rsquo;s technical director.

					Into the Lead

				<p>
					Washington, DC, which has for years been the murder capital of the nation, has lost that distinction to Gary, Indiana. In 1993, the city of 119,125 had 110 killings, which gives it a rate of 93 per 100,000. Washington has only about 75 murders per 100,000. What makes Gary so dangerous? According to the 1990 census, its population was 80 percent black, whereas that of the nation&rsquo;s capital was only 66 percent black. Gary&rsquo;s blacks are approaching the unhappy distinction of killing off one of every thousand inhabitants every year. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is instructive to compare the murder rates of these two cities with that of the nation as a whole, which is about 9.5 per 100,000. It is even more instructive to compare them with rates for areas that are still overwhelmingly white. Iowa (96 percent white) and New hampshire (98 percent white) both had murder rates in 1992 of 1.6 per 100,000.

					The Los Angeles Fire Department is eagerly wooing non-whites but forbids whites to apply for jobs. As many as 10,000 whites may have been prevented from taking the most recent employment exam, so that the city can be sure to hire more non-whites. The department is under a 1981 court order to diversify, and has tried everything  &mdash;  &ldquo;non-biased&rdquo; exams, different grading schemes for different races, advertising for vacancies only in ethnic publications, fudging the scores of non-whites  &mdash;  but to no avail. The only way to keep those annoying white people from being the best qualified is to prevent them from taking the test.

					Northwestern High School in Dade County, Florida is crumbling and is to be replaced. The school board has decided to accept construction bids from black-owned firms only.

					The Texas legislature recently passed a law that establishes new requirements for trucking companies that seek licenses to operate on new routes within the state. Owners who are women or non-white need only demonstrate that they are capable of operating the new route. White-owned companies must show, in addition, that there is a market demand for their services. For the time being, the law has been set aside by a judge but non-white truckers will appeal the ruling.

					Novel Asylum Claim 
				</p>
				<p>
					In many African countries, it is common to mutilate the genitals of young girls. The procedure usually involves removal of the clitoris and labia minora and is ordinarily done without anesthetic, using a razor blade or a piece of glass. The purpose of the operation is to keep women from taking pleasure in sex, thereby ensuring virginity until marriage and faithfulness thereafter. Many African men think that unmutilated women are no better than prostitutes, and refuse to marry them. The tradition is therefore carried on by tribal women who want to make sure their daughters are marriageable. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, an illegal immigrant from Nigeria has won asylum in the United States, claiming that if she is sent home her five- and six-year-old daughters will be forced to undergo the procedure. The mother, Lydia Oluloro, says it was done to her by female relatives at about age four, and she wants to spare her daughters. They &ldquo;are American girls,&rdquo; she explains. Mrs. Oluloro&rsquo;s former husband, also Nigerian, thinks her opposition to the traditional practice is bogus. He says she was always in favor of genital mutilation and had a change of heart only when the U.S. government started deportation proceedings. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Mrs. Oluloro is the first person to have gained asylum on these grounds. This decision sets a significant precedent: Illegal immigrants from the world&rsquo;s most barbaric countries have an inside track on asylum claims if deportation would subject them to the traditional practices of their homelands.

					Executing Whites 
				</p>
				<p>
					In March, the black South African homeland of Bophuthatswana subsided into chaos over whether to take part in the multi-racial elections that will be held in April. A number of white commandos drove to the assistance of the government, which opposed participation, but by the time they arrived, the government had changed its mind. A number of commandos were killed and wounded in the confused fire fight that ensued, and two wounded men lay in the baking sun surrounded by a dozen white journalists and television cameramen. Grimacing with pain, they told journalists where they were from, and why they had come to fight. They asked for water and for someone to call an ambulance. Instead, a black policemen walked up and shot the two men dead. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One cannot help but be reminded of a similar incident that took place in Saigon during the Viet Nam war. As the television cameras rolled, the city&rsquo;s chief of police despatched a young communist with a shot in the head. There was much lamentation in the media over the abrupt denial of the young man&rsquo;s civil rights, and the incident became a symbol for the cruelty and barbarism of the South Vietnamese. There has, of course, been no such outcry over Fanie Uys and Alwyn Walfaardt, who were calmly murdered as they lay in their own blood. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The fate of those two men was at least reported. At about the same period, black gunmen burst into an integrated church service in the South African town of East London. They ordered the three whites in the congregation to line up against a wall and then executed them. This incident was described in the last paragraph of an article on South Africa that appeared on page 72 of the March 15 issue of the <i>Boston Globe</i>.

					Third-World Moves a Step Closer

				<p>
					Whatever else goes on in this country, people generally assume that elections are fair. It may no longer be possible to take this for granted. A federal judge has ruled that a Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania senate won election illegally last November and should be removed from office. William Stinson stole the election from a Republican with an elaborate scheme of voter fraud that involved wide-spread forgery of absentee ballots. The fraud required the cooperation of black and Hispanic residents, who voted by proxy for people who were living in Puerto Rico, were in prison, or were dead. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Two Democrats on the three-member board of elections have confessed that they knew about the fraud but covered it up and hurriedly certified Mr. Stinson as the winner. The court at first ruled that the senate seat should be given to the Republican, Bruce Marks, but a more recent ruling requires that the ballots be recounted. According to a Chicago organization called Legal Elections in All Precincts, absentee ballot fraud is increasingly common in jurisdictions with large numbers of Hispanics.

					Disparate Impact 
				</p>
				<p>
					For some time now it has been against the law to set high job standards for employees, if standards are more likely to disqualify non-whites. Harris County, Texas, has been found guilty of racial discrimination because it required jailers to read at the 12th grade level. Sixty percent of black applicants failed the reading test as opposed to 24 percent of whites. The county must now find 200 blacks who were denied jobs because of this racist procedure, make them jailers, and give them each $3,000 in back pay. No such effort will be made for any of the whites who failed the test. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Likewise, the Dayton Power and Light Company must pay $992,000 to 121 non-whites who failed something called the Meter Reading Scale Test. The test was too hard for them but white aspiring meter readers somehow managed to pass it.

					Newark, New Jersey, is following the lead of many American cities and is blowing up high-rise welfare housing. On March 6th, the city set off 3,800 pounds of explosives, destroying four 13-story apartment buildings in the Christopher Columbus Homes. The buildings were evacuated and closed in 1990, after the city decided it could not control crime and degeneracy among the residents. In its account of the demolition, <i>The New York Times</i> (March 7, 1994) blamed the buildings themselves, saying that &ldquo;tall housing projects were ill-conceived social experiments.&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					The buildings worked perfectly well so long as most of the occupants were white. They went up in 1956 as an inexpensive way to house workers who moved North after the Second World War. Tall housing projects became an &ldquo;ill-conceived social experiment&rdquo; only after welfare-dependent blacks began living in them. Even some former residents realize that the problem was not architectural. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad idea [high-rise buildings],&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad idea when the Housing Authority doesn&rsquo;t screen the families moving in.&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Newark, like many other cities, has decided that underclass blacks can be saved if they are sprinkled lightly through middle-class and white neighborhoods. One problem with this strategy is that Newark already has a large black population and that moving the underclass into the remaining pleasant neighborhoods, is sure to drive away taxpayers.

					Folly Knows No Bounds 
				</p>
				<p>
					The state of New York tests all newborn babies for the HIV virus, but <i>it does not report the results to the mothers.</i> The purpose of anonymous testing is solely to track the progress of the disease, and not even the doctors and nurses know which babies are infected. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A bill in the state assembly would require that mothers be told the results of the test, but the state&rsquo;s AIDS Advisory Council has rejected this plan. Its argument is that a newborn can have the virus only if the mother does, and telling her the baby is infected is tantamount to testing and informing the mother without her consent. So, are infected mother and child to be left in the dark? No, the Advisory Council wants to continue with anonymous testing, but to fund a program that would counsel all new mothers <i>voluntarily</i> to have themselves and their babies tested for AIDS. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To recapitulate: The state already tests all babies. The AIDS Council wants to pay for counselling to persuade mothers voluntarily to be <i>retested</i> so they can learn the results of a test that has already been done. This would not only require doing the work twice, but would mean that mothers with practically no chance of having AIDS must be badgered with horror stories so that they will take the test. The irresponsible mothers most likely to have AIDS will still be free to live in ignorance of the fact that they can give the virus to their sex partners or their next children.

					On Jan. 14th, white police officers in Texarkana, Texas shot and killed a black woman who had opened fire on them. On March 11, the case was duly taken before the grand jury, even though the killing seemed entirely justified to everyone but blacks. It was widely expected that the grand jury would find no reason to indict the officers, and word quickly spread that blacks were going to riot. With memories of Los Angeles still fresh, many whites believed rumors that busloads of black gang members were on their way from the West Coast to help the locals tear up the town and kill whites. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For a few days, many whites stayed home from school and did not go shopping or to restaurants. The only businesses that boomed were gun dealers. One Wal-Mart store completely sold out of bullets. The area&rsquo;s popular Central Mall was deserted; according to rumors, it had been burned to the ground. As expected, the grand jury failed to indict, but blacks did not riot. Now they are accusing whites of racism for fearing that they would.

					Sir  &mdash;  According to Patricia Turner&rsquo;s book, <i>I Heard it Through the Grapevine</i> (reviewed in your February issue), blacks are suspicious of Kool cigarettes. They reportedly think that the unconventional spelling links the brand to the KKK and that Kools can somehow poison them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps so. Nevertheless, when I worked at a 7-11 store in Los Angeles for several months in 1982, I noticed (after it was pointed out to me by one of the Koreans I worked with) that Kool menthol was far and away the most popular brand among black customers. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, aren&rsquo;t there some black &ldquo;rappers&rdquo; who use the word &ldquo;kool&rdquo; in their names? It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that blacks are suspicious of Kool cigarettes despite the brand&rsquo;s unconventional spelling.

					Sir  &mdash;  I cannot say I am very surprised by your revelations about George Washington Carver  &mdash;  not because I knew the facts but because I am old enough to know how blacks were treated in the pre-civil rights South. There were a few boors who tormented blacks, but the vast majority of whites treated them kindly. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You report that Carver&rsquo;s white foster parents did their best to give him an education-probably a much better education than they had themselves. It was not at all uncommon for whites to take an interest in talented blacks and further their careers Likewise, it is no mystery why Carver&rsquo;s white contemporaries who were aware of his meager record kept silent. To denounce him would have been ignoble. It would have been like hitting a man who could not fight back.

					Of course, liberals have an answer for this. They like to depict all Southern whites as low-I.Q. cross-burners, but when they find evidence of the many kindnesses shown to blacks, that was &ldquo;patronizing.&rdquo;

					Sir  &mdash;  Hats off to Theodore Pappas for his book about Martin Luther King&rsquo;s plagiarism. As your reviewer points out, far more remarkable than King&rsquo;s dishonesty is the degrading lengths to which whites went to hide the facts and then justify them when they could no longer be hidden. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Pappas renders two important services. First, he demonstrates that what King did was willful and contemptible, not just a technical violation of obscure academic conventions. Second, by treating the racial toadying of white journalists and academics with the contempt it deserves but so seldom receives, Mr. Pappas makes it slightly less likely that other whites will act in the same way in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that books like Mr. Pappas&rsquo; are so rare is both a symptom and a cause of our current racial confusion. Let there be many more authors like him.

					Sir  &mdash;  In the April issue, Robert Briggs takes an earlier letter-writer to task for denouncing such people as Tom Metzger and the KKK. Mr. Briggs points out that at least these people are doing something about our disastrous circumstances, whereas <i>AR</i> readers just wring their hands. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Doing something&rdquo; may be cathartic but it is often unhelpful. The antiabortion cause is not advanced by people who &ldquo;do something&rdquo; by shooting doctors who perform abortions. Forest-lovers would not gain public support by beating up or killing lumberjacks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some brutes have an instinctive grasp of the point of view that is put forward so calmly and irrefutably in <i>AR.</i> However, the interests of our race, like the interests of any group, are <i>not</i> served by spokesmen who are crude, ill-bred, intemperate or violent. It should be men of the highest stature who speak for us, not those who simply have the biggest mouths. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, our problem has been that men of the highest stature have not been willing to speak for us, thus leaving the field open to the big-mouths. I am confident that this is changing, and I look forward to the Atlanta <i>AR</i> conference as a sign of that change.

					Sir  &mdash;  In his letter in the April issue, Michael Walker writes that the truth about the black-white intelligence gap can be made more palatable by playing down the importance of intelligence. He writes that an unintelligent but good person is better for society than an intelligent criminal. True, but irrelevant. Beethoven composed sublime music when he was deaf but that does not make a virtue out of deafness. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the same fashion, it is ridiculous to argue, as Mr. Walker does, that blacks need not be ashamed that their race is not intelligent enough to invent nuclear bombs. Their race did not invent microprocessors or antibiotics either. Intelligence cannot be compensated for by other qualities. A race of morons, no matter how virtuous, could still do nothing about appendicitis or prevent death in childbirth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, it does not appear to me that blacks, as a race, have distinctive gifts that could in any way be seen as consolation for low average intelligence. Not all clouds have silver linings.
