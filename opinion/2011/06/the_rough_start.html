				The Start of a Long, Hot Summer?

				Last year, <em>Alternative Right</em> editor Richard Spencer <a href="http://www.alternativeright.com/main/blogs/trash/race-riots-2.0/">wrote</a> about an emerging pattern in black crime which he referred to as &#8220;Race Riots 2.0.&#8221; He noted that blacks no longer seemed content to riot in their own <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">neighborhoods <span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">as they did during the Los Angeles Riots of 1992, but were bent on giving whites a direct taste of diversity.</span></span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Mr. Spencer was prescient. This spring has seen many reports of mass &#8220;teen&#8221; robberies, roving mobs of &#8220;youths,&#8221; and chaotic &#8220;urban&#8221; uprisings. Young blacks often organize with the help of social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook. The resulting groups are not only raiding department stores for sneakers, they are disrupting family vacations, attacking passersby, and straining the ability of many major cities to maintain order.</span></span>

				<p>
					<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Explicitly-black events </strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Blacks who enjoy attending large gatherings with other blacks have had a disappointing start to the summer, as many events that are geared to them have gone wrong. In some cases, the authorities have begun to wonder whether such events should even be held in the future, and some municipalities have taken <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/fremont-street-evicts-black-history-festival-114632009.html">preventative measures</a> to keep them from happening in the first place.

During an 8-hour period, police received reports of &#8220;five armed robberies, a stabbing, a shooting and an incident involving a shotgun being pointed at a security guard.&#8221; <a href="http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/14746715/myrtle-beach-police-see-busy-weekend-for-crime">This article</a> was frank about the color of crime during Black Bike Week. None of this stopped the NAACP from <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/05/31/36933.htm">suing</a> businesses that closed during the weekend or otherwise tried to avoid the crime wave.

When bullets were not flying, &#8220;stripping and dancing in the perpetually congested traffic was . . . frequent&#8221; and &#8220;women stuck in traffic simply climbed on top of their cars and gyrated for onlookers.&#8221; Homosexual Hispanic activist Herb Sosa <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2011/05/gay-activist-herb-sosa-south-beach-a-war-zone-demands-end-to-urban-weekend-with-video.html">said</a> the city was &#8220;nothing short of a warzone&#8221; and called for an end to &#8220;Urban Beach Week.&#8221; Many city leaders were echoing his call.

There was a stabbing just a few blocks away. At nearby Howard University, a <a href="http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhafNEnJmHv3Sr08EL">massive brawl</a> broke out, apparently between students of the historically black university.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cynics are beginning to wonder if a large-scale black gathering can actually be put on without violence. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-07-19-Indy19_ST_N.htm">At last year&rsquo;s Indiana Black Expo</a> in Indianapolis, ten young black men were shot. For this year&rsquo;s &#8220;celebration,&#8221; to be held from July 7 through 17, <a href="http://www.fox59.com/news/wxin-indiana-black-expo-indiana-black-expo-working-to-overcome-stigma-of-violence-20110614,0,7731717.story">vast preventative measures</a> are being taken, including some 500 patrolling police officers who will enforce a curfew for underage participants. A detailed &#8220;<a href="/pdf/2011_Summer_Celebration_Action_Plan.pdf">Action Plan</a>&#8221; has also been created and is designed to prevent the violence of past years.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Group attacks</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The summer months bring free time, which some blacks choose to spend attacking random (often white) victims.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">· </span></span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2008252/Teenage-gang-charged-lynching-law-savage-attack-18-year-old-student.html">In Columbia, SC</a>, eight black teens attacked 18-year-old Carter Strange as he was jogging home from a friend&rsquo;s house, and beat him so badly his mother barely recognized him. Mr. Strange has a cracked skull and hemorrhaging that required surgery. He also needed facial reconstruction surgery to repair his broken nose and the broken bones around his eyes.

					<span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">· </span></span>In Chicago, a &#8220;group of about 15 to 20 youths&#8221; carried out a string of random muggings, first attacking a 68-year-old man smoking a cigar on a bench, then knocking a 34-year-old man to the ground and beating him. The same group beat a 42-year-old man from Japan and stole his iPod.

Police report that she was &#8220;jumped&#8221; by some 30 to 40 young men who punched and kicked her repeatedly.

Whoever knock him out would be king.&#8221; Eight of the ten victims interviewed in the article linked to above were white.</span></span></span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The Internet and cell phones have made it easy for blacks to gather suddenly for dubious purposes. Many have started gathering in largely white areas, and this has attracted attention. As one Chicago journalist put it after a bout of &#8220;flash mob&#8221; attacks, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">&#8220;<span class="apple-style-span">If this kind of violent behavior had occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood, it wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the nightly news.&#8221; Perhaps. Many &#8220;mainstream&#8221; news organizations still do not cover these incidents.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">When they do report on mob violence, many news sources mask the race of the perpetrators (for example, referring to &#8220;Black Bike Week&#8221; as &#8220;Atlanta Beach Bikefest&#8221;), and many readers and commenters are angry about it. A number of newspapers received so much criticism for failing to mention race that they felt compelled to justify themselves (see </span></span><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman/chi-race-and-the-flash-mob-attacks-20110608,0,1883170.story"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">here</span></a><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, </span></span><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/tribnation/chi-when-race-is-mentioned-in-the-chicago-tribune-20110610,0,136289.story"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">here</span></a><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, </span></span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/13/AR2010081304465.html?sub=AR"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">here</span></a><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">, and </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">here</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">). </span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">When the <em>Drudge Report</em> highlighted some of this summer&rsquo;s incidents, <em>Salon</em> writer Alex Pareene </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">accused</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Matt Drudge of running a &#8220;race war awareness campaign&#8221;-even though Mr. Drudge mentioned race only once.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">These incidents are different from traditional &#8220;race riots.&#8221; The mass violence of the 1960s through the 1990s was usually in response to specific events; most commonly a police shooting. Blacks then rioted in their own neighborhoods. </span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">So far, the current rash of violence is less destructive. Mobs have not taken to burning down buildings and cleaning out whole blocks of stores, as they did during the worst incidents in the past. But there is a unnerving quality to &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; that gather on a whim-often on what seems to be an anti-white whim. Some incidents seem to be deliberate attempts to jolt whites in precisely those parts of town where blacks are seldom seen, and where whites usually gather with no fear of crime. Where this anti-white animus will lead is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpLast" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-left: 0in; mso-list: none; mso-add-space: auto; tab-stops: .5in;">
				<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Our rulers continue to pretend that rampaging &#8220;youths&#8221; can be of any race, so mainstream journalists insist that race is not relevant to their stories. Readers know better, and demand the facts. Either news sources will have to start censoring or ignoring their commenters-and lose what little credibility they have left-or write the truth.</span></span>

										A slimy politician, or activist, or Episcopal priestess with short hair will start talking about it and drawing attention to it and himself, then call for hearings (a trick)

										O&rsquo;bama will fund a new commission to study the problem of persistent and racist White privilege

										Recommendations will include putting a White privilege tax on your retirement fund to help pay for more social justice programs to root out the lurking, hostile, and dangerously anti-community White racism
									</p>
									<p>
										You will suffer, which is just the normal trend since the 1946 fair housing edict in Texas, which means all is well, all is normal, all is according to plan, and you can shut up and go back to worshipping Afro-Zul MLK Messiah. And if you don&rsquo;t vote for Obama, you&rsquo;re a racist and will be taxed extra.

										It is useful to have this all in one article. I have been keeping up on these &#8216;flash mobs&rsquo; by visiting various sites, Amren included. Right now I have to use public transportation and of course the riders are mostly blacks, Hispanics, and foreign students. The only altercations I&rsquo;ve seen so far is between a particularly belligerent black woman (a school teacher no less!) and a couple of men on two different occasions. I don&rsquo;t carry or flash any devices while on the bus, but I do take my laptop with me to a book store on Saturdays. But then again, I get there at 9:00 AM so I suppose the gangstas&rsquo; are not out of bed yet.

										The civil rights legislation of the 1960s was possible because the standard of living for most whites had been growing since the end of the Second World War, and to a lesser extent, since the inauguration of Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. This placed most whites in a generous mood. The standard of living for most whites has declined since Bill Clinton left office. Consequently, we are in a bad mood.
									</p>
									<p>
										White liberals and white radicals tended to forgive the black ghetto riots that happened from 1964 to 1968 because they were primarily concerned with the War in Vietnam. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not generated the opposition that was directed against that earlier conflict.
									</p>
									<p>
										If &ldquo;Race Riots 2.0&rdquo; are seen to characterize the behavior of young blacks, those blacks will confront a much more punitive white majority, and they will have few if any allies among white progressives.

										<i> Young blacks often organize with the help of social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook </i>

										Isn&rsquo;t it funny how often blacks use our most modern white technology for planning out riots? This is interesting in other respects too. The old explanation for the lack of black computer programmers, for example, was that they &#8220;lacked access to technology.&#8221; That has been exposed as the total canard it is.
									</p>
									<p>
										The new explanation is that they lack positive role models,&#8221; but that rationalization has also been disproved. After all, the wonderful role model of Obama as president has failed miserably to put a damper on black violence. In fact, if anything, it&rsquo;s made it worse.

										The list of early-summer disturbances here is appalling. What has happened to this country? The way the mainstream media conducted its (carefully limited) coverage of them is equally disturbing.
									</p>
									<p>
										The follow-up excuses published by the various newspapers and linked to in this article show that the who-what-when-where-why is less important to modern editors than, &#8220;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let the readers know the perps were black!&#8221; Why isn&rsquo;t race pertinent to a story? Or rather, when does it become &#8220;pertinent&#8221;? Is it not pertinent if a gang of black teens beats up and robs a couple of White pedestrians? How about if they kill one or both of those unfortunate people?
									</p>
									<p>
										I guess the story the other day about blacks rampaging down the street yelling, &#8220;Kill the White people!&#8221; left the press no choice but to, reluctantly, identify the trouble-makers by race. The comments posted, sometimes in the hundreds, at the ends of these see-nothing, hear-nothing stories, indicate how fed up and angry the average White reader is getting with this squeamishness about calling a spade a spade.

										who has coined several acronyms and phrases pertaining to America&rsquo;s black problem I think of this time as BLACK MOB SUMMER or BMS for short.
									</p>
									<p>
										BTW when I first noticed that Paul put his name on his website and books I thought how either brave or foolish that was. Then I saw a string of the old DEATH WISH movies on TV and realized that the protagonist played by Charles Bronson is named Paul Kersey.
									</p>
									<p>
										Paul was predicting BMS (without that exact name) months ago. It does look to be quite a news and political phenomenon which is quite positive for the race realist camp. It will be a significant factor in Obama losing 2012. Already the 2010 election show a dramatic decline in white (especially working class - and they are the ones least able to avoid BMS) support for Obama. Also this phenomenon is adding to the long-term discrediting of the (Obama-supporting) liberal dinosaur media. And it is stimulating the growth of the realization of whites that they have a group interest and that the PC MC bilge of diversity-worship we have endured for decades is nonsense.
									</p>
									<p>
										I wish this had happened because of thoughtful people pondering and learning from the magnificent work of Jared Taylor rather than from blood flowing in the streets (and on the beach) but Amren can&rsquo;t compete with Drudge for attracting eyeballs.
									</p>
									<p>
										People are coming to realize that BMS not only makes them less safe personally but threatens community life on a large scale and that threatens retail business, already suffering, and is destroying the viability of festivals, street fairs and the like. Mass attractions like amusement parks and water parks and even urban beaches are threatened. Public life, broadly speaking, is eroding because of BMS-type behavior.
									</p>
									<p>
										People are waking up to all these things.

										&#8220;Youths&#8221; is a code word for blacks by the MSN.

										The rash of black racial bigotry, manifested in violence, is indefensible. The media should identify it for what it is, and demand all races be protected. And of course some white guy will in a split second pre-emptively strike some black in a hostile situation only to be deemed a hater. Even though the white had &#8220;probable cause&#8221;. Of course the MSN should identify these attacks by racial identifiers, it is their civic duty to protect others by allowing them to know that groups of black youths are disproportionately dangerous and to be on guard if they can&rsquo;t be avoided.
									</p>
									<p>
										And why doesn&rsquo;t the MSN note the broad occurrences of black mob violence? Sociologists call this cognitive dissonance. The inability to acknowledge something contrary to one&rsquo;s belief system. This is a highly unprofessional of course dangerous.

										Nearly every day now there are internet reports of at least one black rampage. Elitists are sometimes attacked, and the mobs are moving into upscale areas. It simply strains credibility to see newspapers and national TV continue to censor mention of the events or fail to describe the criminals&rsquo; race!
									</p>
									<p>
										Obama&rsquo;s election has obviously emboldened many of these perps, and some may be reacting to his failure to hand the store over to &#8220;his people&#8221;. Unlike the riots of the 60&#8242;s, these actions are not in the ghettoes. These mobs are boarding public transport and purposely traveling into white areas. In the old days, the police would have reacted with swift, even brutal measures to deal with wilding blacks. Now, criminal blacks believe they have free rein. City streets and public parks are becoming like the &#8220;Indian territory&#8221; of the past, where any travel by whites was extremely dangerous.

										The Minneapolis Star Tribune, under its former ownership, was the most politically correct wacko newspaper in the country. It refused to mention the name of sports teams with Indian nicknames; hence, you can read a 2000 word article about a game that doesn&rsquo;t mention the visiting team by name &#8220;the Cleveland team,&#8221; &#8220;Cleveland,&#8221; etc. But under its new owners, it has started telling the truth about crime.

										The average white person does not follow the news the way we do. One has to read sources from all over the country to find out just how common and vicious the attacks on whites have become over the last few years. The MSM does not want white America to know just how much danger it is in until it is too late. Rather like the Czar, kept in the dark until there was no saving him or Russia. If it isn&rsquo;t on the 10:00 o&rsquo;clock news or the front page of the local penny-saver Mr. and Mrs. America won&rsquo;t know. They use the internet for amusement, not serious reading.
									</p>
									<p>
										Forget the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; on talk radio. They blather on and on about how gay marriage and the teacher&rsquo;s unions will destroy western civilization. If I have to hear Governor Christie say just one more time that incompetent teachers are the reason Da&rsquo;Quan can not read I will explode. Never a mention of the race war around us.
									</p>
									<p>
										I would venture to say that a higher percentage of the ethnic group that controls the broadcast and print media as well as Hollywood want us dead than do blacks. I really believe that. And like the Romanovs we will be clueless until just before the end comes.

										I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that black panthers could have a black power march which attacked whites and as long as they stole just one thing the newspaper would conclude that race was not a relevant factor and wouldn&rsquo;t report it. The crime would be labeled as being motivated by theft. I personally hope a lot of these newspapers go out of business. There is no difference of opinion in the mass media anymore.

										Much, and maybe most, of the enticement to violence derives from black conflict with Latinos. Whites are just a juicy, easy target and scapegoat. Try doing this in Latino districts. For most blacks, especially of the violent underclass, there is more daily contact with Latinos than with whites. We readers of AR know only too well how that is going. When the media ignore the race angle, not only are they misleading about who is comitting the violence and who is receiving it, but also falsely pointing guilt at whites. We have to find a way of forcing the media to stop this defamation of whites.

										We were warned by the segregationists of decades past that this would happen. It is only going to get worse. wait until whites are a minority. Black Americans are de- evolving. They realize they no longer have excuses to blame for their behavior. The election of a black president was their worst nightmare because they finally got what they wanted and it doesn&rsquo;t change a thing. Avoid any gatherings of blacks and learn how to defend yourselves. When the govt. goes bankrupt these people will be on the streets like a zombie movie looking for whitey.

										Thanks for crediting my essay from last summer.

									<p>
										What I find interesting about this social phenomenon is that, overall, crime has been declining over the past 20 years, mostly due to the incarceration of large numbers of individuals. Indeed, the U.S. has the largest imprisoned population in the world!
									</p>
									<p>
										A &#8220;social contract,&#8221; of sorts, has arisen in which Whites put up with a lot of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and Black empowerment, so long as the government locks up all the really bad people.
									</p>
									<p>
										My sense is that with all these spectacular, racially motivated, and sadistic beatings, the arrangement is beginning to break down.

										I am not cynical, but large-scale black gatherings will not happen without violence, and what more, they are likely to become very much more violent, as they become more isolated from other races. They are then not distracted by wandering candies wearing gadgets, that may make them look interesting. Murder by riots will be their special kind of population control. Therefore they must be left alone.

										What this shows-beyond a shadow of doubt-is that if and when Native Born White Americans become a racial minority within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;, they will be violently persecuted..and not just by black youths. Racial minority status for Native Born White Americans means that Native Born White Americans will have put their fate in the hands of a rapidly expanding and heavily armed-after all, nonwhites will be the majority in the &#8220;US&#8221; military-hostile post-1965 nonwhite population. This would be suicide. Native Born White American Patriots must put it in these terms when they speak to their fellow Native Born White Americans on MSM outlets.

										Cops Fear Violence Against Flash Mobs
									</p>
									<p>
										UPPER DARBY, Pa. - As police in Upper Darby, Pa., search for more young people involved in last week&rsquo;s flash mob, more adults are thinking about arming themselves with guns.
									</p>
									<p>
										People are talking about how afraid they are of being caught in the path one of these flash mobs while they&rsquo;re out minding their own business, and they want to be ready.
									</p>
									<p>
										Law enforcement officials say it&rsquo;s a nightmare in the making because ordinary, private citizens are getting gun permits.
									</p>
									<p>
										&#8220;We have people now that are fearful and carrying guns because of children. How sad is that?&#8221; Upper Darby police Captain George Rhoades said.
									</p>
									<p>
										Rhoades says with that many people &#8220;carrying&#8221; and the violent actions of these flash mobs, the worst is bound to happen.
									</p>
									<p>
										&#8220;Now we have this mentality, &#8216;I&rsquo;m not going to retreat. I&rsquo;m not going to call 9-1-1. I&rsquo;m going to be a vigilante and take care of the problem myself,&rsquo;&#8221; he said.
									</p>
									<p>
										That means flash mob children could be dead, and the would-be victims may have the right, but Rhoades is appealing to everybody to think twice.

										Gosh, could it be that apartheid had some basis in the realities of living with a black majority and that the status of blacks in the Old South was equally based on first-hand experience and observation of black behavior and intellect?
									</p>
									<p>
										There&rsquo;s not a single instance, anywhere, of successful black governance, of successful black economic progress, of black technological advances. Individual blacks, certainly, have stood out in many respects, but the generalization regarding black failure in a modern world remains valid and will become more-so in the future. As a group they simply can&rsquo;t compete. I wish it weren&rsquo;t so, but, tragically, that&rsquo;s the way it is. It&rsquo;s the most intractable problem facing any society with large numbers of black within its population.

										#19 I just read all the explanations for not reporting race in the news. I recommend others read them. They are perfect studies as to how the mind of someone who reports the news works.
									</p>
									<p>
										-
									</p>
									<p>
										I read the explanations as well. As #7 stated, the same argument could be used not to mention age or gender, yet somehow those things are considered &#8220;relevant&#8221;.
									</p>
									<p>
										I also observe that the same news reporters find ways to identify whites as whites, whenever it suits them (with photos, for example).
									</p>
									<p>
										What makes race relevant is the agglomeration of such stories, which makes it a social trend that requires reporting. I would wager that 99% of any attacks by gangs on vulnerable individuals, and 99% of wild rampages, are by blacks. This is newsworthy.
									</p>
									<p>
										Fortunately, readers now know to supply the missing race.

										Three points:
									</p>
									<p>
										1) Documenting and cataloging all this violence is important. When it&rsquo;s all assembled in one place, you can start to see the pattern and begin to tell the story that&rsquo;s larger than any one incident.
									</p>
									<p>
										2) I think it&rsquo;s likely these attacks will get worse. Sadly, I also think it&rsquo;s likely that a white person will be killed, maybe several. When that happens we must put the feet of our authorities to the fire to demand justice. The outrage must be loud and vocal, both so that the victims receive justice and so that our fellow whites will start to hear about what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s sad but true that black on white violence is one of the main ways that white people wake up into racial awareness.
									</p>
									<p>
										3) A lot of these attacks get brushed off as &#8220;random violence&#8221; or motivated by robbery, and even though whites are often predominantly the victims, no hate crime charges are issued. It&rsquo;s very frustrating.
									</p>
									<p>
										I think we all know there&rsquo;s a racial component to the incidents. Blacks might not use a racial epithet when they&rsquo;re beating a white person half to death, but we all know their victim was chosen because of their skin color and that part of the reason blacks commit these assaults is to terrorize the white communities in the area, sending the message that &#8220;blacks rule the street.&#8221;
									</p>
									<p>
										More should be done to get at the heart of these attacks and ferret out the racist element, and get hate crime charges going against the perpetrators. We should demand that law enforcement start combing through the facebook, myspace, tweets, cell phone texts, voice mails etc. and make note of every single racist epithet logged there in order to build hate crime cases.
									</p>
									<p>
										We know the SPLC would be doing the same thing and leaving no stone uncovered if the racial roles were reversed. Since the SPLC obviously doesn&rsquo;t care about white people, we should demand law enforcement show the same concern and attention to detail for white victims in investigating these possible hate crimes.

										There&rsquo;s an object lesson in that article. Capt. Rhoades probably leads a decent moral life in private and probably the same in public. (I&rsquo;ll say that, then we&rsquo;ll soon find out that the FBI is investigating him for something. For the meantime, presume he&rsquo;s straight as an arrow). So much so that all that, combined with the proper skin color, gets him into a leadership position in this city&rsquo;s PD. Since he&rsquo;s a cop, his duty is to enforce the city&rsquo;s laws, the state&rsquo;s laws, and (for the most part) the Federal government&rsquo;s laws.
									</p>
									<p>
										Yet, when the rubber hits the road, he is opposed to white people using their legal rights to self defense against wild gangs of black thugs for one reason and one reason only: Because he is also black.
									</p>
									<p>
										The object lesson? A black is a black is a black is a black is a black.
									</p>
									<p>
										Keep that in mind, those of you who might harbor sympathies for Allen West and Herman Cain. Make any one of them President, or give the former any measure of power in Congress other than being a regular Congressman, and they&rsquo;ll do just like this Capt. Rhoades did.
									</p>
									<p>
										As an aside, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Governor just signed a bunch of doctrine making self-defense easier, the &#8220;Castle Doctrine&#8221; bill.

										First, they trade the beating incidents for that flash mob that robbed Sears. Then, they act like some white person is going to shoot them down for that! &#8220;It&rsquo;s just kids,&#8221; the reporter says. And the police chief acts like a 911 call will stop a beat down! The one hopeful thing is that the alert they made may slow down the flash mobs. But nothing will change the shape of things to come.

										I agree #39, a news piece by Fox or ABC reporter that exposes the racial motivations as you say on Twitter, could make someone&rsquo;s career.

										Here&rsquo;s my fearless prediction-There will be a riot in Venice Beach, California sometime over the 4th of July weekend. Weather forecast is looking warm and these &#8216;youths&rsquo; just want to give everyone a taste of diversity.

										&#8220;blacks no longer seemed content to riot in their own neighborhoods as they did during the Los Angeles Riots of 1992. . . mass violence of the 1960s through the 1990s was usually in response to specific events; most commonly a police shooting. Blacks then rioted in their own neighborhoods&#8221;.

										Where is the authors proof of this besides his assertion? Is the author 60 years old and did he happen to be there at all disparate events across various distances and times? Or is the author simply parroting the mainstream media (and other responsible &#8216;news coverage&rsquo; of these events?

										&#8220;When the Drudge Report highlighted some of this summer&rsquo;s incidents, Salon writer Alex Pareene accused Matt Drudge of running a &ldquo;race war awareness campaign&rdquo; &mdash; even though Mr. Drudge mentioned race only once.&#8221;

										Alex Pareene does not want Whites to be aware of the race war currently being waged by blacks, on Whites.

										White people must start up a NAACP style law firm in their interests.
									</p>
									<p>
										White people must stop waiting for the media and mainstream racist institutions to stand up for them. It is time white people started bringing law suits.
									</p>
									<p>
										Also, white people must use the language of the society in their own defence. Make the society live by its own rhetoric.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, start calling the racist media out. Do not call it anti white. Just call it racist.

										This stuff has been going on continually since the 1960&#8242;s. Remember we had anti-white riots in Cincinnati and Seattle around 2000 in which many whites were attacked and one was killed. Crowds of blacks beating whites on the street happens all the time. People are just noticing it more now due the internet.
