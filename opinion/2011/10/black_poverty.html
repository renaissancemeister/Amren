			<h1>
				Black Poverty
			</h1>
			<p>
				Joseph Kay, American Renaissance, October 7, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Crying for help on the newest Blackberry.
			</div>
			<p>
				Since the 1960s the federal government has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into alleviating black poverty. Yet, black politicians talk as if blacks are tottering on the economic edge and could easily slip into Third World levels of misery: starvation, deadly illness, families reduced to living in homeless shelters and relying on soup kitchens.
			</p>
			<p>
				Are black leaders crying wolf? Statistics on poverty are notoriously tricky (especially when calculating government benefits and &#8220;off-the-books&#8221; income), but it is increasingly clear that this tale of woe lacks credibility. Judging by what I can see, the opposite may be true: many blacks are living conspicuously well and could easily survive on far less government generosity.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start with statistics, Ken McIntyre at National Review Online recently noted that while one in seven Americans is officially certified as poor by the Census Bureau, most live in decent, often air-conditioned housing with modern appliances. Many have washing machines, cable TV (often with two color TVs and a DVD player), Internet access, up-to-date electronic gaming systems such as Xboxes and PlayStations, and can easily pay for food and ordinary medical care. A similar Census Bureau study reports that the poor often have a car (a third have two or more cars), and that half own a computer and enjoy more living space than the average non-poor European.
			</p>
			<p>
				The popular image of hungry children is absolutely wrong-only 1.3 percent of all American children suffered any hunger in all of 2009. This affluence may even be under-stated if we subtract the poor who are genuinely incapable of self-sufficiency: the mentally disturbed, drug addicts, destitute old people, and others who legitimately need state-funded care.
			</p>
			<p>
				But perhaps more relevant than these statistics is what can be witnessed personally. To be sure, my observations are local and may reflect idiosyncratic circumstances, but reality seems a far cry from the sky-is-falling rhetoric offered up by Jesse Jackson and company.
			</p>
			<p>
				My own views reflect seven years of living in New York City, riding the subway almost daily, and watching knots of blacks in public places. I strongly suspect that what I see is routine elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				The giveaway traits of lower-class blacks are flashy cheap jewelry, sloppy dress, baseball caps at rakish angles, and-particularly among women, regardless of age-rampant obesity. We are not talking &#8220;a bit chubby,&#8221; but hugeness that I would estimate afflicts a third or more of all black women under the age of 60. Many are constantly eating from small packages of snack food.
			</p>
			<p>
				Almost every black-save the elderly-is mesmerized by some hand-held electronic device. State-of-the-art cell phones, iPods and Blackberry-type devices are de rigueur and constant use suggests expensive monthly plans. Indeed, the latest research confirms my view that blacks are not denying themselves. Among mobile phone users, 33 percent of blacks own a smart phone, while only 27 percent of whites do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many younger black women sport professionally executed tattoos, elaborate braided hair-styles, and virtually every woman seems to have fancy professional manicures and even pedicures. They have a penchant for fake designer pocketbooks while young men favor the latest athletic shoes. Aside from the occasional beggar-who is almost always obese-I have never encountered a single black person who resembled the stereotypical 19th-century urban poor, let alone what is common in the Third World.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I see is consumerism Ã¼ber alles. A visitor to the local Best Buy might think he was living in Detroit, not Manhattan, given the clientele&rsquo;s racial composition. Black women who are no doubt classified as &#8220;poor&#8221; abound in clothing/accessory stores, and nearly all pay with credit cards. I have sometimes seen smartly dressed blacks at supermarkets paying with food stamps, and they were hardly buying basics. The black appetite for playing the lottery is well known. These observations fit well with research that shows that blacks substantially outspend whites on visible &#8220;prestige&#8221; consumer goods such as clothing, cars and jewelry.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would estimate that giving up a premium cell phone and cable subscription, eating and shopping less, making do with last season&rsquo;s electronic gadgets, skipping regular manicures and cancelling credit cards (and paying off balances) would easily reduce monthly expenditures by several hundred dollars. Put another way, a more ascetic life would be the equivalent of President Obama giving every black person a monthly bonus of $300-perhaps more if you calculate credit-card interest. Needless to say, this do-it-yourself &#8220;stimulus package&#8221; of self-restraint is not on the public agenda.
			</p>
			<p>
				In-your-face excess invites resentment, particularly if we include many non-visible but well-known benefits such as gift mortgages and free daycare. It is not hard to imagine how whites react when they see black leaders on television demanding yet more federal spending to rescue blacks from disaster. No doubt many whites also understand why blacks stay at the bottom while one immigrant group after another zooms past them: Unbridled consumerism-not white racism, discrimination and the other alleged culprits-undermines both investment in education and acquisition of capital necessary to get ahead.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bottom line is a growing standoff between blacks who crave yet more entitlement spending and non-blacks who are tired of paying for this wastefulness. More is involved than just money; rampant consumerism at public expense is deeply felt and correctly seen as morally unfair, a modern incarnation of Aesop&rsquo;s tale of the ant and the grasshopper. Though nobody will say it, this outrage probably helps fuel the Tea Party.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like all wars, &#8220;The War on Black Poverty&#8221; is a long, expensive campaign that requires sustained public support. That support may be rapidly eroding. Why engage in budget-busting quests so millions can have spiffy cell phones and diabetes-inducing obesity?

								In a country based on consumption as opposed to productivity, wealth redistribution is accomplished by taxation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The productive sector is taxed and the money is distributed to the &#8216;poor&rsquo;, where it is quickly spent and trickles up to the privately wealthy who own the outlets of consumption.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is also how global foreign aid works. Very little wealth stays in the recipient countries. Most ends up in the bank accounts of the middlemen.

								There seems to be a standoff regarding entitlements on both sides. It would appear that the left, that Obama and Co. would like to continue printing money for a free party until we suffer Wiemar style inflation, while the right seems to have trouble distinguishing between benefits (SSI, Disability Benefits) and entitlements (the pathology described in this article). There has to be some sort of middle ground.
							</p>
							<p>
								My conscience would not allow me to vote for Obama in 2012. But if Bachman is the presumptive nominee, I may have to stay home. I refuse to vote for someone who does not understand the basic properties of something as simple as carbon, regardless of her stance on immigration (and she&rsquo;s the only Republican besides Ron Paul who has any gumption on the issue).

								Glad to see our tax dollars spent to help them get those smart phones, the cool threads, and the bling, while both of our cars need repairs (at least they&rsquo;re paid for&hellip;but they&rsquo;re getting pretty old) and we&rsquo;re just getting by.

								If I would have known that this article was coming, I would have saved my &#8220;poor people have poor ways&#8221; soliloquotic rant for now, the one in the &#8220;Love Thy Neighbor&#8221; story about Haiti and the DR from a few days ago.
							</p>
							<p>
								The only slight flaw in Mr. Kay&rsquo;s analysis is that in order to have all this bling and all these electronics and all this conspicuous tacky consumption, blacks aren&rsquo;t able to pay the utility bills. At that time, they go crying boo-hoo to any social service agency they think will help them pay their bills in arrears. They also sacrifice buying food in order to have their bling, and they make that up by going to food pantries, lying about their income and residency in order to get food orders at multiple pantries, in spite of various pantries having service areas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The credit card bills? Does he honestly think that every black person pays them down to the penny? The civil courts building in St. Louis City is full of banks, retailers, etc. trying to sue blacks for delinquent lines of credit. People think of &#8220;white collar crime&#8221; and think of white corporate executives, the reality is that (especially women&rsquo;s) Federal prisons are full of black women doing time for credit card fraud.

								I did some volunteer work not long ago at a homeless shelter, in the kitchen.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although there were many there with whom I sympathized, there were others&hellip;
							</p>
							<p>
								The whites, with the exception of an occasional &#8220;w****r&#8221;, were generally some true down and outs. Mental illness, misfortune, a bad decision or two, physical illness and a bad economy - not good for whites or anybody else. Regardless, the whites were generally VERY grateful. They almost always thanked me for the food I served them, almost never complained or made special requests - seemed beat-down humiliated often, to be where they were.
							</p>
							<p>
								In all fairness the same could be said for many of the blacks, but&hellip;
							</p>
							<p>
								Some just had incredibly low IQ&rsquo;s. Otherwise decent people with not much going on upstairs. They could have benefited from a little good old fashioned white paternalism, those who could behave and showed their willingness to work by volunteering in the kitchen and helping out.
							</p>
							<p>
								Others, however, most of whom were no geniuses themselves, displayed a variety of typical behaviors and modeled perfectly the supposedly &#8220;racist&#8221; negative stereotypes. Gigantic black women who could barely shuffle about and who required special diets for their creeping diabetes. Males and females talking on cell phones.
							</p>
							<p>
								But perhaps the most galling part was this.
							</p>
							<p>
								Every day an underpaid white man came in (he worked like 80 hours a week) and somehow made ends meet - somehow coordinated the volunteers, scrounged up enough food, prepped and supervised the preparation of it, did his paperwork, and since he was a jam-up cook, managed to serve up a decent, hearty, nutritious meal every night. I was a volunteer scrounging around for a paid position and one step up from the street myself. Not the best days of my life&hellip;
							</p>
							<p>
								And here were these blacks who would routinely ask for more of the meat laden main course in lieu of the mixed veggies&hellip;or make sarcastic comments about the quality of their free fare, or demand special porkless substitutes&hellip;
							</p>
							<p>
								You know&hellip;if I were taking free food from someone who was volunteering his time to help me, or slaving his posterior off for a pittance, and I was really hungry and desperate&hellip;
							</p>
							<p>
								I&rsquo;d eat a cat if he cooked it nice for me. And thank him. And compliment him on his cooking. And ask for seconds if any were left. And volunteer to help clean up&hellip;
							</p>
							<p>
								In all fairness there were many blacks who seemed as horrified and shocked to be there as the whites, who were polite, grateful, and volunteered to help (some at every opportunity, in an effort to get away from the others one once admitted to me).
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact one night one of those, who was successfully transitioning back to the world and was late for supper because he had worked all day, got severely and humiliatingly dressed down by an especially nasty, large, lazy, incompetent black female employee. That bothered me as much as the picky beggars, but not as much as when she mistook me for an inmate once and found herself replaced by one of the hard working volunteering residents she had berated.

								Mr. Kay is 100% correct. Having worked in retail more years than I care to count, I could tell you stories of welfare abuse by minories that would make your head explode. One black woman really stands out though. She would come in once a week with her 5 kids, all dressed in designer clothes, buy several hundred dollars worth of junk with her EBT card, then load her BMW and zoom away. The bling she wore would have paid our mortage for probably a year. Of course we knew her real name because of her welfare card, and one employee was so disgusted by her, she wanted to call and report her. Oddly enough, that employee was also black.

								The blacks suffer from one of the worst forms of poverty. A complete lack of self control. They have no idea of value. They think all that glitters is gold and they want it now. That is their downfall. All appearances of any type of refinement in any way is just an illusion with them.

								To me, this makes it more appealing to do away with income taxes and impose more consumer goods taxes. That way, blacks feel the weight of their own use of EBT, food stamps, Section 8 and other forms of welfare.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the only way to go! If blacks want more &#8220;goodies&#8221;, they&rsquo;ll have to pay higher taxes at the cell phone kiosk, at Best Buy, at the Nail Salon, at McDonalds, the Pawn Shop and everywhere else they go.

It&rsquo;s another case of &#8220;Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?&#8221; Amazingly, most Americans seem to go along with this nonsense.

								2 Hirsch:
							</p>
							<p>
								We&rsquo;re electing a President, not a scientist. She doesn&rsquo;t need to get the atomic properties of carbon correct, but she would need to get the immigration issue right, and of all the announced candidates, she&rsquo;s closest to right. Problem is, I think she and Romney have quietly become a tag team, there was a WaPo article several weeks ago about Romney &#8220;weaponizing&#8221; Bachmann after Perry entered the race. I think her campaign only exists now to sink the open borders Rickroller to help the open borders Romney (make no mistake about that, either. Too, he&rsquo;s a globalist &mdash; Proudly announcing that at a campaign stop at The Citadel). Cabinet position or Romney pressuring the House Republicans to make her Speaker is probably the quid pro quo.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, Ron Paul has no gumption on the immigration issue. He&rsquo;s too scared of his own shadow to use the legitimate power of government to protect us from our own racial dispossession. Yeah, no border fence/wall because it could be used to &#8220;keep us in,&#8221; as if a throng of libertarian Patriots actually want to flee to Mexico. That&rsquo;s another thing we have to address in the long term &mdash; this paranoid mania among some of our people about &#8220;consistency&#8221; (ideological rectitude) and the logical fallacy of &#8220;slippery slopes&#8221; where they&rsquo;re worried than any government anywhere using any amount of force puts us on an irreversible track to Hitler and gas chambers.

								I live in a midsize northern city with a substantial black population and I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I see blacks driving fancy automobiles. The vast majority of BMWs, Mercedes, Lincoln Navigators, Jaguars, etc. I see driving around have blacks behind the wheel. Sometimes I&rsquo;m not even able to get a good look at who&rsquo;s inside them because many of these cars have window glass that&rsquo;s deep tinted. Your tax dollars in action.

								Every day near where I work there are &#8220;poor&#8221; blacks begging. They happen to be riding around in taxpayer-provided motorized wheelchairs, which I presume cost in the $5k to $10k range. They are overweight, and probably would not need wheelchairs if they lost weight and were not lazy. I think they also feel a certain status to being handicapped, and it also means they get more benefits, cannot be evicted. And there are psychological benefits: everyone must make extra efforts to accommodate them. It&rsquo;s a form of assertion of power.
							</p>
							<p>
								They get access to first world quality healthcare, provided by us. They get free bus passes from the city so they can come to my nice area to beg and pollute our area. They must be charging those fancy motorized wheelchairs somewhere, presumably they have &#8220;free&#8221; utilities in their &#8220;free&#8221; homes. They get &#8220;free&#8221; housing I&rsquo;m sure, along with &#8220;free&#8221; food and free whatever else. I know some of them having outstanding warrants but there&rsquo;s no point in arresting them because they have nothing to lose.
							</p>
							<p>
								They&rsquo;re &#8220;poor&#8221; but they somehow are fat, well-cared-for, and are able to consume tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars per year from taxpayers, in the form of the world&rsquo;s best healthcare services and everything else.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yeah I&rsquo;m crying every time I see them. Crying over how much money we&rsquo;re flushing down the toilet. Crying that no white people are angry enough to put a stop to it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The author brings up this statement as something he disagrees with: &#8220;black politicians talk as if blacks are tottering on the economic edge and could easily slip into Third World levels of misery: starvation, deadly illness, families reduced to living in homeless shelters and relying on soup kitchens. &#8221; Actually, due to blacks&rsquo; inability to save or plan even 24 hours into the future, <i>they would plunge from a relatively comfortable existence all the way to third world starvation within 72 hours of their EBTs being cut off.</i> They would not even have a can of tuna available to them.
							</p>
							<p>
								And at least real third worlders tend to be able to work hard when they have the opportunity, because they are familiar with lack of food. Gigantic EBT-dependent black women here would be unable to do any work, even if they were hungry, due to physical inability and lack of any type of stamina.
							</p>
							<p>
								Urban dwellers, take note, because the end of the EBT is coming, and things will be ugly. I myself hope there will be an abrupt end to the EBT and massive layoffs of the government make-work jobs and finally blacks will be equal to whites: they will have to take responsibility for their own lives, just like us. I say again, urban dwellers, be ready because it will be ugly.

								In reference to obesity among African-Americans, I refer you to the article by Michael Pollan, a journalism professor at Berkeley who writes about food politics, entitled &#8220;You Are What You Grow.&#8221; In it, he states that after adjusting for inflation, vegetables increased in price by 40 percent while soft drinks decreased in price by 23 percent. Our government subsidizes corn and wheat heavily, making products made from it cheaper than healthy food. These calorie-laden foods promote obesity. This isn&rsquo;t just a black thing, either: poor whites are often obese as well.

								&#8220;SKIP&#8221; I know just what you&rsquo;re saying. I still use my seven-year-old cell phone - the ones that you used to get for $.99 with the plan! It still works - and I have more important things to spend money one than &#8220;must-have&#8221; gadgetry and electronics!
							</p>
							<p>
								I live in an outer New York City suburb and can assure you that it is the same here. One clear sign of Blacks&rsquo; conspicuous consumerism is the fact that one cannot go to a store, outlet or mall but that it isn&rsquo;t filled with Blacks. How much they actually buy I cannot say, but they certainly spend enough time in stores, and often carrying large shopping-bags, so one can deduce that they are buying something.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another issue we see here that one wouldn&rsquo;t see in the city nearly so much, is the expensive automobiles Blacks love to drive. I NEVER see Blacks in older model, or beaten-up cars. No, they are in the latest SUV&rsquo;s, tricked out cars with expensive tires, rims and what not, etc. How they can even qualify for the loans on autos like these is beyond me - but I suspect we can hazzard a guess how it all works!
							</p>
							<p>
								This Black &#8220;poverty&#8221; business, at least in the Northern US, is an absolute canard. Genuinely impoverished people don&rsquo;t drive new cars (or any cars, generally), don&rsquo;t wear designer clothes have cable-TV, eat-out all the time, possess the latest electronic gadgets (which cost hundreds of dollars each), aren&rsquo;t festooned with jewelry, and perhaps most obvious&hellip;aren&rsquo;t morbidly obese from reckless over-eating!!

							<p>
								I think they took that line from the Detroit tourism Pamphlet.
							</p>
							<p>
								Seriously, the only thing that keeps Detroit from turning into Africa, is all the state and federal tax money that goes pouring in there. Otherwise, there would be no electricity or running water, the infrastructure would collapse&hellip;I really mean that!

								There is an interesting video on YouTube and if anyone knows the link, please send it to me as I cannot locate it again.
							</p>
							<p>
								Anyway, in the video, two Nordic types are debating third world immigration into their country. One, young and liberal, and fully in favor of immigrants coming to his country. And the other was an older guy who was against it and said they would ruin the country.
							</p>
							<p>
								The focus of the debate was around IQ. The young liberal said the third worlders would become westernized over time, their IQs would go up because of better nutrition and schools. The older guy totally disagreed. Both were scientist of some type and had lots of letters after their names.
							</p>
							<p>
								As I sat watching the video it occurred to me that this &#8220;immigration experiment&#8221; had already been tried and it was called Detroit, Cleveland, Gary, East St. Louis. Third worlders had been brought to America, given hundreds of years to get &#8220;caught up&#8221;, given completed cities, schools, fire departments, police, museums, and the third worlders had destroyed it all&hellip;.like Detroit
							</p>
							<p>
								The older guy in the video should have brought that up but he was Nordic and I guess he did not think of it. He has probably never been to Detroit.
							</p>
							<p>
								If anyone knows the video I am talking about, please send me the link. It was not in English but it has sub-titles. <a href="mailto:awm4151@yahoo.com">awm4151@yahoo.com</a>

								I totally believe that Detroit is the future of our civilization.

								Well, there are some decent White people who NEED foodstamps to survive. Especially the elderly and the disabled. I am one of those unfortunate &#8220;users&#8221;. I worked for 40 years paying into the system so others could eat never dreaming I would one day be among them. It is because of the massive numbers of nonwhites on the system today that WE will also have to suffer. It never fails. Because of those massive numbers of nonwhites in our country who steal everything we worked for and paid into, many Whites will now also suffer.
							</p>
							<p>
								The same with SSA/SSI/Medicare. We will lose that also due to the millions of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who never paid a dime into it and are now the recipients of our foolish generosity. We always shoot ourselves in the foot, don&rsquo;t we?

								The reason why so many Blacks and Latinos are obese is because there are far many more fast-food restaurants in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods than in primarily White ones. Here in Los Angeles, there was some controversy a few years ago about the disproportionately large number of fast-food restaurants in the South Central area of the city(which, by the way, was once all-Black but now boasts a much higher Latino population in certain areas) and about the &#8220;questionable&#8221; business practices of these establishments (i.e., buy one burger and an order of fries at regular price and get a free large drink, buy one burger and get the order of fries free, etc.). Many &#8220;community activists&#8221; claim that the unmistakable presence of these establishments coupled with their business practices have played a key role in the obesity epidemic and that their profits today far exceed those of the 1970s and 1980s-something which I find hard to dispute.

								I agree with this. Whites have lost most of the natural instincts at self preservation. In addition are so guilt ridden and race issue averse that instead of saying no take to pointing fingers at each other over who is more &#8216;racist&rsquo; when these issues come up. Very few can stomach holding either poor people or non whites responsible for anything and as a result we are in this perpetual downward spiral that seems to have no stopping or exit.

								#1 Is absolutely spot on!
							</p>
							<p>
								I live in Los Angeles and own several WIC stores. If a low-income individual receives a government benefit, that money eventually finds its way to my account.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the proceeds of this government handout, I pay rent, I pay a utility bill, and I buy more product - all of which employ other individuals who then receive a weekly income.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the end of the year, the landlord, the utility company, the wholesale distributor, and myself have all made a profit. We then turn over a portion of this profit back to the government in the form of taxes - and we are all a bit richer&hellip; and the poor a bit less hungry.
							</p>
							<p>
								I could assert that it is those that have not figured out how to benefit from this system that cry the loudest against it. However this would be misleading. The more truthful statement would be: anyone who has an income is on someone else&rsquo;s dole, and is reaping the benefit of a subsidy of some sort.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you work anywhere, for anyone, doing anything, I can easily trace your paycheck back to some sort of government subsidy&hellip; because chances are your customers, the ones that make your paycheck possible, are receiving some sort of government payout.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some might criticize me for these statements. But the fact is I didn&rsquo;t design the system, I am just aware of it&hellip; and have made a point to profit from it.

								White settlers (Trekboere) first encountered the black tribes of Southern Africa c1770 near present day Port Elizabeth as they migrated eastwards from Cape Town.

								This kind of spending habits are indicative of an arrested state of development. For example- when kids are old enough to get an allowance they will first start spending everything almost the minute they get it. If parents are intellegent they will help kids learn to save by not buying them stuff outside of necessities. For example if a kid wants the latest toy he and he has to save his allowance for several weeks to get it then he will take care of it better. In other words the pop and candy doesnt seem as alluring as the latest action figure or other toy. This sort of attitude by blacks goes way back- black leaders at the turn of the 20th century told their people that if they were willing to save instead of immediatly spending their paychecks on clothes, shoes and other trinkets. We pay cash for every car we have had and buy our clothes second hand for a fraction of the original cost. One thing we have discovered is that designer outlet stores are rarely a good deal but they are often full of lower income people thinking they are getting something for almost nothing. Even refugees from Africa will spend all kinds of money on clothes and shoes before making sure their rent or utilities are paid.

								I notice the author had to be retired before feeling free to speak his mind. When I started my missionary hobby for AR it was these kinds of people I wanted most to find. I avoided people at work and neighbors and instead sought out people in coffee shops, bars, lunch counters, smoking areas, and taking the bus. I found many too but the results were disappointing. They were often in agreement with AR. They liked talking about white issues and enjoyed reading the newsletter but I couldn&rsquo;t get them to want to do things. I told them there were many ways to help whites and that no one was expecting them to stand in front of city hall with a protest sign. Since most of these people were short term acquaintances, I don&rsquo;t know what eventually happened to them. I like to ponder about what happened to the ideas I explained to them and the newsletters I gave them. I know there was some passing along of ideas and newsletters to other people.
							</p>
							<p>
								So the moral of the story is be careful about delaying your white activity until you are safely retired. You might not feel like bothering then.

								One more thing to consider about obesity:
							</p>
							<p>
								Many poorer people, including blacks and whites, eat not only &#8220;fast food,&#8221; but also eat a load of carbohydrates. For instance, in the &#8220;It&rsquo;s free! Swipe your EBT!&#8221; videos, just about every person in those videos is snacking non-stop&hellip;. on beverages, high-carb bagged snacks (potato chips, etc.). Eating this stuff sends your blood sugar and insulin levels skyrocketing, which on rebound sends your blood sugar lower and makes you HUNGRY ALL THE TIME.

								I do not believe that ignorance is motivating the black complaints. Blacks know what their situation is, and want to keep the goodies flowing freely. They are complaining to prevent any reduction in benefits. If they came out as gratefully satisfied, some of their benefits would be diverted to other groups.

								On a hot summer day some years ago as my postman approached my house I noticed that his face was red and he looked close to tears. Upon inquiring whether he needed some shade and a cold glass of water he replied that it wasn&rsquo;t the heat that was upsetting him.
							</p>
							<p>
								It seems earlier in the day he had carried government checks to a group of black people celebrating payday on their front porch, malt liquors in hand, and jeering at him for working in this heat.
							</p>
							<p>
								He told me that on that day he had determined that his generosity of spirit toward the &#8220;needy&#8221; had been seriously compromised.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then, when his eight hour job was over he went home to get his farm chores done. He needs the two jobs because his daughter had a baby with a black man who left her and the child with him so he is supporting two families.
							</p>
							<p>
								I&rsquo;m wondering which of the two subjects of this post is most deserving of assistance and compassion.

								And just a comment on nutrition. It is not impossible to feed a family nutritious meals with little money if you buy bulk ingredients and prepare the food yourself. Funny how many people think that just because you don&rsquo;t know how/don&rsquo;t want to cook that it somehow impels you to eat fast food. That&rsquo;s all social conditioning and was unheard of fifty years ago when fast food was a novelty.
							</p>
							<p>
								And who has more time to cook than the unemployed, for heaven&rsquo;s sake?

								You sir are not creating wealth, even if you make a &#8220;profit&#8221;. Only people who create make wealth. The farmer who grows wheat and the baker who makes bread from that wheat. The miner who brings iron ore to the surface and the mill that turns the ore into steel. The plant that turns the steel into a washing machine. All of those men create wealth. Everyone else merely lives off the real wealth creators activities. As fewer and fewer Americans actually produce anything of value, the economy comes closer to collapse. The government, the people who live off government trasnfer payments, and shopkeepers do not create wealth. Money is not wealth. It is merely a medium of exchange. The point is near, if not past, where the takers out number the creators. Once that happens you have Zimbabwe. And once the happens the only thing the government can do is collapse. We need to remove the takers from society.</b>

								In reality, if you were to give a responsible person the same benefits, he/she could get by for a while until they got back on their feet. My car is functional and does not have Sprewells (spinner rims). My cell phone does not have every app known to man. The clothes that my family wears are generally &#8220;bling-free&#8221;. I wonder how much better I could live if I weren&rsquo;t supporting parasites? The worthy poor are one thing, but the reality is that there aren&rsquo;t that many of them compared to outright derelicts.

								In high school, I flipped burgers in the 11th &#038; 12th grade. We had our fair share of people who showed up that didn&rsquo;t wish to learn anything. Especially black females with two or three kids by the time they were 21. Many were there until they could figure out how to get back on welfare. This was years before the &#8220;end of welfare as we know it&#8221;. (Or just shifting the costs to SSI).
							</p>

								Many of us have seen the video about EBT benefits being cut off in Clayton County, GA. BTW, there was one white couple featured on the video and while they looked frustrated, they were waiting until things could be restored. That is just one county in the US. What will happen when China shuts off the money tap? Imagine a scenario where Big Box marts and convenience stores are not able to be replenished with a short time frame. (Just screw up payment systems for corporate refueling for example). Most stores only have 3 - 4 days of food on hand at any one time. Go into one of these places during the night shift and you will see people putting anything and everything up on the shelves. How many EBT recipients have planned ahead for a Katrina like problem? Oh yes, that is my &#8220;White privilege&#8221; getting the best of me to suggest a little planning.

								Great comments! Let me just add my own moment of epiphany: I was near the downtown area of my large Southern city, waiting in a long queue of cars at a stop sign. To my right, there was a recently renovated public housing project, with cheerfully colored vinyl siding. A large, new, Ford Expedition was trying to leave the parking lot, and I let her out in front of me. I could see her clearly as she swung by-a very large black woman, in her gigantic SUV, talking animatedly on her cellphone. And it struck me: she lived in the projects! My eyes swung around to the parking lot, and took in the number of minivans, the children arriving home from school with their expensive-looking clothes and backpacks, and I realized that not a single car in the lot was as old and beaten-up as my own. That day, the scales slid from my eyes.

								Racism is a form of generalization. Although this article presents an accurate generalization, I personally know people (such as my upstairs neighbor who is quiet, well-spoken, financially prudent black man) that fly in the face of this generalization (in fact I am using his internet for free, what a nice guy).
							</p>

								Most black people are generally quite dishonorable, and indeed reprehensible. God has made sure, though, to put me in many situations where I have learned to not throw the baby out with the bath water. The doctrine of diversity (even though many of its adherents are rooted in delusion and ignorance) is not without some merit. I will accept white man&rsquo;s burden, within the bounds of my dignity and ability, and live out its meaning in the 21st century for the glory of my God.

I&rsquo;d rather have a class of special ed white, hispanic, and asian students than a class of non special ed black students. I am speaking from actual experience and this was affirmed to me through frustration. Most people do not realize how infuriating it can be to be disrespected by them and their parents. I know better now!

								No, we need to remove the nonwhites from OUR society. What makes our social programs a nightmare is almost all of it is comprised of minorities. They are everywhere! Go to any Welfare office and SSA office, jails, prisons and schools across our nation and 9 out of 10 are NONwhites. Their own people pay only a fraction of the taxes, yet they TAKE all of that, PLUS most of our taxes to sustain their parasitic natures.

								&#8220;Racism is a form of generalization. Although this article presents an accurate generalization, I personally know people (such as my upstairs neighbor who is quiet, well-spoken, financially prudent black man) that fly in the face of this generalization (in fact I am using his internet for free, what a nice guy).
							</p>
							<p>
								Most black people are generally quite dishonorable, and indeed reprehensible. God has made sure, though, to put me in many situations where I have learned to not throw the baby out with the bath water. The doctrine of diversity (even though many of its adherents are rooted in delusion and ignorance) is not without some merit. I will accept white man&rsquo;s burden, within the bounds of my dignity and ability, and live out its meaning in the 21st century for the glory of my God.&#8221;
							</p>
							<p>
								How nice&hellip;. I suggest you actually look up the Kipling poem, &#8220;The White Man&rsquo;s Burden.&#8221; But I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just another generalization that you can ignore.
							</p>
							<p>
								And yes, I cannot help but point out how one &#8220;traditional&#8221; Western religion is responsible for his rationalization - and deficit in Classic Western Literature.

								that&rsquo;s not me you were responding to, but I am going to comment on your question.
							</p>
							<p>
								This morning I was reading comments on the CNN news story about how the US Military drones operating computers have a virus that cannot seem to be eradicated. So far, it only seems to be marking keystrokes. Among the various comments was one guy who identified himself as Chinese (in US) and even used his photo (assumed) as his avatar. He said &#8220;Soon China will be able to use those drones to destroy the US without shedding one drop of Chinese blood.&#8221;
							</p>
							<p>
								The record of Chinese &#8220;citizens&#8221; spying for and otherwise operating illegally in the US is high, regardless of it being of the white collar variety. But the REAL problem is that this poster has to represent a percentage of Chinese in America. We have already seen that overwhelming immigration has been Balkanizing the US for some time. The looming problem is the idea that should a crisis evolve, we have more China loyal Chinese in America now per capita than we ever did Japanese just before or during WW2.
							</p>
							<p>
								While necessarily commenting on the various situations in the Chinatowns across the US, which includes the long time skirting of FDA rules in importing often dangerous &#8220;Chinese Medicine,&#8221; there is a history of Chinese organized crime in their own community here, and a growing attitude that Chinese and Asians in general ought to have a free hand in the US because of this vaunted 2 point IQ differential compared to whites among the most elite who get here.
							</p>
							<p>
								China is allowed to remain Chinese. Foreigners are only tolerated in a limited way. Should not the same cultural and racial rights be accorded US?

								- I&rsquo;ll respond as well. It isn&rsquo;t that I would lump you in with a bunch a thugs, but that even if Asians have a higher income, better grades in school, lower crime, whatever, you are still non-White, and that is the sole reason you should not be within our society.

I do understand your sentiments about black apathy, mayhem, and unrelenting social violence. However, you also have social and economic pathologies that plague WHITE AMERICA as well. Take a look at WALL STREET! Who do you think run the banks, saving and loan companies, and investment firms who are virtually robbing the AMERICAN WORKING CLASS people like you and me blind with all of their PONZI SCHEMES, CHICANERY, and STEALING? Look at ENRON 1 DECADE AGO AFTER 9/11, BERNARD MADOFF&hellip;ECT&hellip;.!

								What we are experiencing today in not just a WHITE PROBLEM, IT IS AN AMERICAN PROBLEM PERIOD! Let&rsquo;s put this thing into the paradigm of PHYSICS and BIOLOGY. We all get hungry and have to eat. We all get frustated with life from time to time. We all have to use the restroom from time to time. The human hands are not designed to funtion like the feet and vice versa. We only have 1 brain and 1 heart apiece and those two VITAL ORGANS function just alike in each and every human being. The brain controls the thinking and coordinates bodily functions and the heart pumps blood throught our circulatory system. It is not the opposite way in any of us!
							</p>
							<p>
								As far as the UNCIVIL WAR is concerned: Blacks and Whites alike fought on BOTH SIDES (The Union and Confederacy)and bled, suffered, and died just the same.

								I have had the eye-opening experience of traveling around a real Third World country in Southeast Asia. In 2007 there was no EBT, no Section 8, no subsidies for cable, the internet, and celphones. The poorest of the poor lived in &#8216;squatter&rsquo;s camps&rsquo; that were mainly a collection of shacks on stilts over trash-filled rivers. The police were corrupt and easily bribed, politicians were cheats, there was some threat of Islamic terrorism. Beggars, even tiny kids, were everywhere. When my cab(public transportation was too hazardous) stopped at a light street urchins would come to my window with hands out or try and sell me flowers, jewelry, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our &#8216;poor&rsquo; have it made here. I work full time at a somewhat decent job but barely have enough to rent my apartment. No celphone, no cable, no internet (I&rsquo;m typing this at a local coffee house). When I use public transit or go to the grocery store I see obese black women swiping EBT cards while yakking into their I-phones. Their unruly brats wear $100+ sneakers. The spoiled kids remind me of another thing I saw when I was in the Far East; in the morning school kids would come out of the shanties dressed in clean uniforms!

								When I lived in Norfolk, VA going shopping was a tough task. The first of the month was a no-go zone. At the end of the month all the grocery stores were abandoned. At a Walmart a obese black lady had two carts full of food. The bill came to $530. I actually prayed that she would pay with anything but an EBT card. Nope! I paid with my debit card, which meant the money came out of my checking account! Here&rsquo;s something to look and ponder. <a href="http://theamericanscoop.blogspot.com/2011/08/what-do-all-these-people-have-in-common.html" rel="nofollow">http://theamericanscoop.blogspot.com/2011/08/what-do-all-these-people-have-in-common.html</a>

								You&rsquo;re right about all these white people on Wall Street and in various corporations running Ponzi schemes. It might seem on the surface that I&rsquo;m nothing more than a managerial accountant in my mid-thirties driving an 11-year old car and living in an unremarkable suburban St. Louis apartment building, noticeable gray around the ears all of a sudden. But that&rsquo;s just to the untrained eye; Us whites who know the secret Power Structure White Privilege handshake can see right through my ruse. They all know that I moonlight as the engineer of a multi-billion dollar ponzi scheme. There isn&rsquo;t an oil company or a poverty center alive that I can&rsquo;t crash to the ground. I&rsquo;m also secretly a Fortune 500 CEO - All white people are. Every white person in America, all 200 million of them, somehow hold a certain position of which there are only 500. Then again, like I said, all white people run Ponzi schemes, too, secretly trying to ruin the corporations they secretly run.

If not, we&rsquo;re gonna continue to get in 2012 what we got in 2008, 2004, 2000, 1996, 1992&hellip;.ect, catch my drift?

								I am from Arizona and I can count the number of Blacks I see on two hands on one month. (and I wouldn&rsquo;t use all ten fingers).

								I received a real education when I went back East for a year to do a job.

								All I can say is&hellip;Blacks are disgusting and I&rsquo;m really being nice with my assessment. Really I am.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thankfully I was never one of those jaded White liberals who tried to tell White people how prejudiced they were against Blacks. I just assumed that White people who had to live around them all the time; knew the score&hellip;and they did and they do.

								Blacks make Mexicans look like saints and Mexicans are all that great either.

								Question Diversity @68, thanks for the comments. Trust me when I say that blacks like myself DO NOT LIKE these black POVERTY PIMPS or MENTALLY INSANE WHITE LIBERALS that perpetually keep all of us fighting one another and divided. And continue to PROTECT YOUR FAMILY at all cost! In closing, Question Diversity: I&rsquo;m not anti-white, anti-black, nor anti-American, just plumb anti-stupidity!
