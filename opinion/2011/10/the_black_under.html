	                	<p>Is the black underclass a <em>severe</em> threat to America? The answer is &#8220;yes&#8221; but not for the reasons you think. Yes, their crime, multiple pathologies such as drug addiction, their penchant for mayhem, and the financial burdens they impose are troublesome. These traits are not, however, a lethal threat. Similar pathologies can be found to a lesser degree among Appalachian whites, and Hillbillies have long been safely ignored. A good case can also be made that the black underclass&rsquo; worst features are avoidable, often just by fleeing or behaving prudently.</p>
<p>What makes the black underclass a <em>serious</em> threat is that the underlying culture is contagious, spreading into the population more generally thanks both to white-run corporations and-even more important-to the government itself. This is historically unique. The black underclass culture is deeply antithetical to the bedrock principles that created America, but in today&rsquo;s battle over &#8220;who we are,&#8221; thanks to ample outside help, the underclass mentality is gaining.</p>
<p>Let us begin by recognizing that underclasses are eternal and not strictly a matter of race, though some racial groups are often over-represented. But regardless of racial composition, the historic reaction to this population is condemnation, not emulation. Yes, the disheveled urchins in Charles Dickens&rsquo; novels elicit sympathy and even inspire charity, but no proper Englishman, even working class folk just a step above those living in squalor, would ever, ever seek to imitate them. The opposite was true: The ever-present underclass served as a powerful reminder of what could happen to anyone who surrendered to depravity, so even the slightest lapse-skipping the morning shave, not making the bed-had to be resisted. Imagine the reaction of a proper 19th century English family if their thirteen-year-old had thought it was &#8220;cool&#8221; to dress and talk like a rag picker?</p>
<p>We have come a long way. Entire industries now exist to <em>promote</em> the black underclass &#8220;life-style&#8221; and there is little pull in the opposite direction. (Ironically, the strongest pushback against this comes from ambitious <em>black</em> immigrants terrified that their children will &#8220;go native&#8221; and soon resemble American blacks.) Some poor whites live depraved lives but there is no impetus to legitimize their culture.</p>
<p>The siren song of the black underclass is everywhere. Almost every suburban mall has stores propagating the ghetto look to white teenagers. At <a href="http://www.buckle.com/mens/new">The Buckle</a> (400 stores in 41 states) white farm boys can buy ghetto-like hoodies to complement sagging, reverse cleavage-showing jeans, all topped off with a baseball cap easily tilted to show a faux gang affiliation. The men&rsquo;s clothing industry organizes special &#8220;urban&#8221; trade shows, and merchants selling to genuine inner-city residents are prized as a source of fashion information that can be exported to the mainstream.</p>
<p>When CDs were still popular the mall&rsquo;s music stores sold rap/hip hop music by the ton, and some white aficionados became &#8220;Wiggers.&#8221; Today TV and the Internet supply the latest in black underclass fashion and lingo to everyone (see, for example, <a href="http://www.vibe.com/">Vibe</a> or <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/">XXL Mag</a>). You can even learn pimp speak. I visited <a href="http://joel.net/EBONICS/Translator">Ebonics Translator</a> and instantly converted my &#8220;Where are the young women?&#8221; into, &#8220;Yo Where is da young beotches? sho &rsquo;nuff!&#8221; I doubt a site exists to help black underclass denizens talk like white people.</p>
<p>More serious is the relentless campaign, often government financed, to remove the stigma from quintessential black underclass traits. Behavior once almost unthinkable is becoming mainstream. White illegitimacy rates now are now equal to those of blacks when Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Family:_The_Case_For_National_Action">report</a>, and more and more whites show a black underclass-like indifference towards traditional marriage and family life. What middle class mother today would warn her teenage daughter against premarital sex because &#8220;only poor blacks do that sort of thing.&#8221; The young lady may well attend a school where many black girls are either pregnant or already have children and suffer no consequences. Hollywood starlets routinely have out-of-wedlock births and cohabit with a steady parade of irresponsible boyfriends.</p>
<p>But, at the very top of the list of nefarious bottom-up transformations is how American society increasingly adopts, almost invisibly, the Santa Claus view of government. To put it bluntly, government is bribing many whites to behave as if they were underclass blacks. The older notion of government existing to provide only collective benefits-national defense, highways, a currency, public safety and the like-is in decline. We are instead developing a more &#8220;modern&#8221; understanding of government as a provider of all of life&rsquo;s requirements: food, shelter, recreation, medicine, and everything else Americans once provided for themselves through their own effort. Washington&rsquo;s job description increasingly resembles something that a black underclass member would write: a responsibility for everything. It now takes an entire bureaucracy to raise a child to adulthood-and that&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>The formula for successful contagion is simple: start by targeting the black underclass and then let politically driven mission creep ensnarl ordinary citizens. Consider, for example, government help for young children, a task once considered totally beyond government&rsquo;s role. Head Start was supposed to close learning gaps between blacks and whites, but 45 years later it is just one part of a far broader government-administered &#8220;early intervention&#8221; enterprise hardly limited to blacks. Similar expansions have occurred with school lunches (and now breakfasts), government subsidized housing (including mortgages), and free government medical care. In 2010, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (what used to be called &#8220;food stamps&#8221;) had <a href="../../../ora/menu/Published/SNAP/FILES/Participation/2010CharacteristicsSummary.pdf">40.3 million</a> recipients and was growing. An increasing proportion of these families have no cash income at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the signature traits of the black underclass-financial irresponsibility-spread virus-like through the population thanks to government pressure on banks to lower lending standards. What began as legislation to ban &#8220;red-lining,&#8221; a practice that only applied to poor urban blacks, has now resulted in countless whites sinking hopelessly into unsustainable mortgage debt. As the army of pauperized whites grows, fiscal insolvency becomes the new normal. And don&rsquo;t forget the subversion of public education as billions are spent to make American schools friendlier to underclass blacks through relaxed discipline and dumbed-down graduation standards. Our overseas economic rivals could not invent a better scheme to destroy US education.</p>
<p>The central fact is that since the black underclass&rsquo; problems are intractable, there can never be a &#8220;mission accomplished.&#8221; There will never be a V-J-Day style dancing-in-the-streets victory celebration with government employees pensioned off. With huge government bureaucracies in place, the war on black underclass pathology is forever, and make no mistake, like a black hole that sucks everything into it, more and more Americans will slip into this &#8220;life-style&#8221; of dependency. This is not as alarming as flash mobs, but the threat if far, far more serious.</p>

Flash mobs are part of the lifestyle of those very people.  The longer the system is in place, and it is there to stay, the more &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; will become a favorite ghetto and beyond &#8220;sport,&#8221; as will attacking whites.  Just as the Occupy Oakland example illustrates, this is the future for much of the American landscape and society.  It will go on until it bursts open because no one can, or is willing to stop it.</p>

One could argue that the worst part about the white negro, or the white who enthusiastically goes along with political correctness, is not that they harm themselves, they are rewarded for doing this in our culture (perhaps this is why they do it if it is not a matter of immitating those they fear), the worst thing about &#8216;the white negro&rsquo; is that they harm not themselves but other whites. They are basically going along with the trend of the day.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that blacks, on average, are at a very significant intellectual disadvantage as compared with all other racial and ethnic groups.  It&rsquo;s a disadvantage that no amount of education can fully overcome.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that blacks can&rsquo;t live civil and useful lives in all kinds of ways.  But they&rsquo;re effectively prevented from doing so by the absurd insistence that with enough remedial action this intellectual disadvantage can be overcome.  It can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is isn&rsquo;t to say that blacks shouldn&rsquo;t have every opportunity to advance as far as their talents allow them.  There are plenty of highly intelligent and accomplished blacks in this country, and in no way should they be inhibited from maximizing their talents, in whatever field they may lie. But this current fantasy of insisting that all black failure must be attributed to racism has to stop, for the sake of everybody, most particularly the blacks.</p>

<p>It has also been expanded by the decline in jobs that provide reasonably adequate incomes and benefits for those of slightly below average intelligence.</p>
<p>From the labor movement in the 1930s to the beginning of off shoring industrial jobs during the 1970s it was possible for a responsible man with a double digit IQ to support a family. As the good life of a production job with a strong union became increasingly inaccessible, the easy life of welfare dependency became more tempting.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-42625" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is an accurate, important analysis of a problem which exists also in England.</p>
<p>True, some whites behave as badly as many blacks, and imitate them, with the &#8220;entertainment industry&#8221; pushing the worst traits as examples; the lowest common denominator.  State subsidies for the workshy and feckless breeders complicate the situation.</p>
<p>However, the added problem is that whereas it is just about acceptable to criticise white trash or trash in general, it is still unacceptable explicitly to criticise black trash, who nevertheless contribute not only disproportionately to the anti-social mix but also specific features, such as gangsta rap.</p>
<p>The &#8220;victims&#8221; have become the &#8220;totems&#8221;.</p>
<p>As you know white copycats joined in the black-initiated urban looting in London and other English towns a short time ago. On October 17, the black co-founder of the &#8220;Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign 1985&#8243; wrote in the left-liberal Guardian that those who &#8220;took to the streets&#8221; are &#8220;still very much unheard&#8221; but see themselves as &#8220;victims too&#8221; and if further &#8220;marginalized&#8221; will have &#8220;no alternative but to lash out&#8221; again and cause &#8220;another riot&#8221;.  These so-called &#8220;protests&#8221; were initiated by black flash mobs, who burned down homes and shops, stole trainers and TVs from ransacked stores, and attacked and evaded outnumbered policemen handicapped by regulations against &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;undue force&#8221;.</p>
<p>Little can be done at present about testosterone-fuelled &#8220;youths&#8221; who disrupt secondary schools, but black leaders themselves, if they so wished, could do more to reduce the excessively high level of knife crime, encourage responsible fatherhood, and combat drug-gang warfare in their own community. The &#8220;educated&#8221; left-liberals won&rsquo;t do it, and neither will the uneducated &#8220;wiggaz&#8221;.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-42626" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Many valid points to be sure, but a little too government bashing for me.  I feel (fear) that with increased automation and many other factors too lengthy to list here, some sort of government involved wealth redistribution may be necessary to avoid impoverishment of the consuming class, which would not be good for the producing class.</p>
<p>I believe the problem is not with government itself as with a non-meritocratic government operating from a deeply flawed set of (ideological) assumptions.  And a deeply anosgnosically ignorant &#8220;electorate&#8221; of all groups who couldn&rsquo;t critically think its way out of a two ended sack - partly a function of electorally and affirmative actionally empowered low IQ types&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me give an example.  As far as I can figure, having consulted various sources, checked their sources and backers, re-checked, educated myself as to certain terms and meanings&hellip;</p>
<p>We Americans spend about 15% of our GDP on our private/public monstrous joke of a healthcare system, live 78.2 years.  Germany is the next biggest spender as % of GDP.  Largely government run &#8220;socialist&#8221; health care system.  They spend 10.2% GDP on healthcare, live a little over 81 years.  In country after country (developed, usually) &#8220;socialized&#8221; medicine consistently, almost without exception in fact, runs less than 10% GDP, results in longer life spans - even in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>So is this the fault of the government?</p>
<p>Regardless, despite my hatred for the evil propaganda foisted upon white people by Lysenkoist public types (education and government), I no more blame the government for our current problems than I do a soulless private sector that glorifies anything that will make a buck (like the most obnoxious and vacuous stupidity the black brain and body can cook up), or the devolved, dysgenic, white, trustfundwunder who fancies himself some Harrison Bergeron but possesses little of the genius and work ethic of those who first accumulated such wealth.</p>
<p>And in my book, the devolved trustfundwunder can become a menace to his less well heeled white cousins one of two ways&hellip;</p>

<p>My family is from eastern Kentucky.  The term Hillbilly is as offensive to us as n****r is to blacks.  And used the same way&hellip;as a term of endearment or as an insult depending on the circumstances.  And if you are one, you can say it.  but it is off limits to all others.</p>
<p>But the author is right.  &#8220;Hillbillies&#8221; have been ignored because they do not whine as loudly as the blacks and people can get away with calling them Hillbillies whereas n****r is of course a no-no, even if they just killed your mother, because blacks are very skilled at being professional victims and have a network in place to boycott or otherwise make a fuss.  White people generally do not do that.</p>
<p>Ironically, I just bought a loaf of bread at the grocery story called &#8220;Hillbilly Bread&#8221; and it features a silly looking white guy in over-alls, no shoes and a funny hat.  Imagine if we could buy jig-a-boo BBQ sauce featuring big-lipped blacks leering at a white woman.</p>
<p>I think you must see my point.</p>

<p>That being said, the article itself points out what many of us already know. However, I tend to think that some of the gangsta stuff - meaning black jargon and style - is picked up more superficially by white culture - mainly teens - and then often discarded as a fad or nonsense trend as whites mature.</p>
<p>The more dangerous aspects include the &#8220;victim mentality- give me your government money attitude&#8221; that seeps out from a pathological black underclass to some whites. In additon, a huge problem is the dumbing down of culture and education and government to accommodate low IQ blacks in positions they are unqualified for. In this case, a shallow lake cripples all the boats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that black pathology is a true danger to whites, and America, and cannot be rectified other than through segregation and enhanced law enforcement, along with a complete change in mindset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-42631" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This emulation of ghetto black culture goes back much further.</p>
<p>Back in the late &rsquo;60s is when black sports stars became stars among whites as well as blacks (e.g., Muhammad Ali, Wilt Chamberlin).</p>
<p>In the early &rsquo;70s, I remember an ad for the Chevy Vega that was titled something like, &#8220;So &#8216;Bad&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Good.&#8221; Whites started saying, &#8220;Hey man,&hellip;&#8221; Whites also took up their habit of elaborate, coded handshakes that would make a Free Mason green w/envy. As I recall, both &#8220;jive talkin&rsquo;&#8221; and the handshakes were made fun of in the 1980 movie, &#8220;Airplane!&#8221; <a href="http://goo.gl/73DJW" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/73DJW</a></p>
<p>Adoption of their music goes back even further.</p>
<p>An important point in this is that part of the emulation comes from fear of blacks and a desire for respect based on fear that blacks have. I remember in the early &rsquo;90s laughing at wealthy white kids imitating black gangstas because they wanted the admiration and fear-based respect that they saw gangstas getting on MTV and the MSM.</p>
<p>The culture whites had in the &rsquo;50s was the result of centuries of reformation based on Biblical principles. We have lost much of it in a mere half-century in a cultural revolution against WASP culture in general, and a progressively more consistent rejection of Christianity in particular. Because of that, America, the foremost nation at the end of WW II, is now bankrupt spiritually (50M abortions; wide spread acceptance of homosexuality and illegitimacy), and financially.  Don&rsquo;t think other world powers won&rsquo;t be more than willing to attack us when we&rsquo;re down.</p>

<p>If you think government in ANY form is the solution to ANY of the problems you brought up, you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>
<p>Government is what got us in these messes to start with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too time consuming to address all of the issues, so I&rsquo;ll pick one.  You gave health care stats on the USA and Germany.</p>
<p>As with crime, factor in race and see what happens with these stats.</p>
<p>Also, we don&rsquo;t have and haven&rsquo;t had for the longest time a free market health care system.  The government has been what makes ours cost as much as it does and, now, they want to come in and &#8220;fix&#8221; the mess they made with all of their regulations and demands.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not necessarily a bad thing that we spend so much on health care, it&rsquo;s the sign of an affluent society.  I just want it to be my choice, not at the government&rsquo;s bequest.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-42634" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The article makes some good points.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weakest claim is the simplistic rejection of European social democracy, which worked beautifully in the small, homogenous, high-trust societies of northwestern Europe, and only came apart at the seams as a consequence of massive Third World immigration.</p>
<p>Until recently, countries like Denmark had no auditing system for welfare recipients:</p>
<p>it seems self-evident that everyone would tell the truth.</p>
<p>His main point is correct: with adequate policing and supervision, and segregated from the rest of the population, a black underclass of 30 million or so is an enormous expense and a nuisance, but not a threat to the survival of society.</p>
<p>He neglects to discuss the toxic consequences of combining the black underclass with massive Hispanic and Third World immigration: Now, the underclass is too small to be contained, or pampered, and threatens to crash the society.</p>
<p>Have you isolate and manage an underclass that is now the majority?</p>
<p>The attraction that whites feel for the the lower, toward the violence, sexual chaos, impulsive, and sheer mind numbing stupidity of underclass culture must be considered a social pathology that borders on mass psychosis.</p>
<p>Why would educated, middle-class white, who has access to the infinite riches of European culture and science, feel any affinity at all for such abject and total failure?</p>
<p>Ironically, neither the left nor the right seem to understand how the black underclass was formed:</p>
<p>Greater opportunities for blacks essentially washed all of the decent, bright, hard-working blacks out of the ghettos and into the mainstream, leaving behind only those so crippled by low intelligence that crime and welfarism were inevitable.</p>
<p>Some whites are waking up to the terrifying reality, but most, drugged with political correctness and complacency and media celebrations of underclass pathology, will remain comatose until it is far too late to do anything about it.</p>

<p>I stopped reading the article right there.</p>
<p>In NO WAY can blacks be compared to Appalachian whites or their &#8220;pathologies&#8221; deemed as similar.  This statement is not only way out of line and WRONG, it promotes divisions between whites and invites others to continually bash &#8220;hillbillies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is time to STOP the engrained stereotyping and dehumanizing of Appalachian whites as uneducated, inbred,  depraved, evil, ignorant, licentious, drunk and racist. These things mark them as expendable, their culture not worth preserving.</p>
<p>Do we whites not have enough enemies in the media?  Why fuel the flames and invite others to pile on?</p>
<p>Those of us from the Appalachian area or descended from &#8220;hillbillies&#8221; (another pejorative) are sick and tired of being portrayed as backwards and ignorant, especially by other whites.

<p>This is not true; blacks hunt for white victims as statistician La Griffe du Lion has pointed out. Many of the recent media-called &#8220;flash-mobs&#8221; that targeted whites for beat-downs and robberies were committed by blacks who had made a point of going into white areas to hunt for whites to assault.  Many of them yelled about &#8220;beating whites&#8221; including targeting whites at flower shows.</p>
<p>Behaving prudently?  Give me a break!  There is no such thing as &#8220;acting prudent&#8221; around blacks.  If you are white, no matter your age, size or handicap, you are a target for beatings, rape, robberies or worse.  The most &#8220;prudent&#8221; thing is to avoid blacks at any and all times and ALWAYS be on guard around them, armed is better.  They won&rsquo;t hesitate to attack you, whether or not you are acting &#8220;prudent.&#8221;  Whites are targeted by blacks for their skin color and every white needs to know this.</p>
<p>For years, the MSM have told us that the primary victims of black crime are blacks, that rape afflicts primarily women, that it is overwhelmingly black-on-black and that black-on-white crime is never racially motivated.</p>
<p><i>In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter&rsquo;s mentality could account for the data.</i></p>

<p>What a world we live in when our own leadership elements celebrate distasteful labels for our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Low wealth, poorly educated&hellip; but you forgot tax-eating and irresponsible drug use. Shockingly high use of government handouts occurs in white communities in Kentucky and Mississippi, and it is a recognized fact that irresponsible drug use (primarily of methamphetamine and marijuana) is a growing problem in rural and woodland areas.</p>
<p>The influence of black culture makes the white-trash problem even worse, however. Do a search on the word &#8220;juggalo&#8221; if you do not believe it.</p>
<p>You might not think so, but I am not so snooty a Yankee to consider anyone with a southern or country accent a dimwit. That said, there are white-trash, always a problem, and now more so because of black cultural influence. The problem might not yet be at English proportions, but it is there all the same.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think &#8220;cracker&#8221; is so comparable to &#8220;redneck&#8221;. Cracker originally denoted a yeoman; i.e. working-class and farming whites who did not own slaves. Now, it means essentially any white person- even Italians living on Staten Island are &#8220;crackers&#8221; today.</p>

<p>With all due respect your opinions regarding government sound like unscientific, unproven, ideology, to which you are perfectly entitled.</p>
<p>I understand that a lot of posters here are ideologically libertarian and kind of knee jerky when it cones to the institution.  And considering what &#8220;gubbamint&#8221; has done in the race arena, considering how compromised it is with incompetent affirmative action hires, set-asides, and promotions, I understand perfectly why many white identitists ascribe to the form of anarchism known as libertarianism.</p>
<p>Sure, the ideal of a nearly totally private system sounds great to many white identitists - a true meritocracy in which the creme will rise to the top without a big bad gubbamint.</p>
<p>Hard core libertarianism represents to me, however, a rather naive and self delusional understanding of human nature, and ultimately a kind of irresponsible obverse of irresponsible dippy-lib-lefty fix-all-the-problems utopianism.</p>
<p>The lib-lefty yearns in his heart for some form of perfection on earth guided by a wise Santa Clause big gubbamint.  Something-for-nothingism.  The hard core libertarian imagines an obverse utopia of the &#8220;no tax&#8221; invisible hand Santa Claus - another something-for-nothingism in my opinion.</p>
<p>The US government oversaw the winning of many wars, built and ran well for decades effective projects like the TVA, sent several men to the moon and back, oversaw the construction of the interstate highway system&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of this accomplished, of course, before the horridly wrongheaded war on merit and talent known as AFFIRMATIVE ACTION was instituted 50 years ago in 1961&hellip;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always amused by the soft core libertarian known in modern parlance as the standard American &#8220;conservative&#8221; who berates the bad old big government at every opportunity until we start talking about that 3 million strong, grand social engineering, wealth redistributing, contract generating, jobs program known as THE MILITARY.</p>
<p>What I see is a lot of wealthy whites, both big gubber limo liberals and no-gubber, self perceived, Harrison Bergeron types BOTH abandoning poor and working class whites to be subsumed into the sea of blackness.</p>
<p>If no government, hard core objectivist libertarian whites want to talk the racial identitist talk, they should consider what can be done to rescue their white brethren in danger a little more.  In the wealthy, the concept is known as &#8220;noblesse oblige&#8221; and that&rsquo;s from long before either Adam Smith or Karl Marx raised their ugly heads.  Precious few of the wealthier hard core libertarian set of this country seem to me to understand much less practice it.  Even when their very race is endangered.</p>
<p>But didn&rsquo;t mean to berate you.  In my opinion, our whiteness is far more important than ideological differences and if the White race has any chance we Identitists will have broaden our definitions of acceptable ideological duckspeak - right, left, whatever&hellip;</p>

Shockingly high use of government handouts occurs in white communities in Kentucky and Mississippi, and it is a recognized fact that irresponsible drug use (primarily of methamphetamine and marijuana) is a growing problem in rural and woodland areas. The influence of black culture makes the white-trash problem even worse, however. Do a search on the word &ldquo;juggalo&rdquo; if you do not believe it. You might not think so, but I am not so snooty a Yankee to consider anyone with a southern or country accent a dimwit. That said, there are white-trash, always a problem, and now more so because of black cultural influence. The problem might not yet be at English proportions, but it is there all the same. Also, I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;cracker&rdquo; is so comparable to &ldquo;redneck&rdquo;. Cracker originally denoted a yeoman; i.e. working-class and farming whites who did not own slaves. Now, it means essentially any white person- even Italians living on Staten Island are &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; today.&#8221;</p>
<p>WOW!  As a Southerner I am really disturbed by this growing trend of white posters on here from up North turning their noses down at Southerners. You do it for different reasons than liberal Northerners do but it is still unacceptable and the facts presented usually aren&rsquo;t accurate.</p>
<p>What is with this idea among so many of you that Southern whites are more likely to immitate blacks and mingle with them than Northern whites are?  I am seeing this theory more and more on Amren and it is down right absurd.  We intermingle with them because there are more of them down here, but we are also much more racially aware because of it.  We have our own ways of separating ourselves from them and they worked quite fine until Northerners forced us to integrate with them. Get off your high horse&hellip;.you have little to be proud of here.</p>
<p>And I find it funny that you mention &#8220;juggalos&#8221;.  I saw a Youtube video about them that was put up on Political Cesspool.  As another poster on that website mentioned, not one person in that video had a Southern accent.  Plus, these white women who sit in the audience of Oprah whooping and hollering waving their fingers in the air just like their black sistas, tend to overwhelmingly be Northern women.  White people immitating blacks in the sense that you are talking about is very rare in the South.  I don&rsquo;t really understand your point to begin with:  how are you connecting white people in Kentucky on welfare, to the topic of whites immitating blacks?</p>
<p>I understand the context that the author does it in, but the author appropriately didn&rsquo;t make this a North/South issue. On the contrary the author talks about it as if it is a nationwide problem and even mentions the problems in Britain.  This is hardly a &#8220;Southern&#8221; issue.  And again, I understand where the author is  coming from in saying that whites on welfare in Appalachia are in a sense immitating blacks, but he by no means is implying that it is intentional in this sense, and that should be obvious.  You on the other hand lose me when you try to connect whites becoming juggalos to whites in Kentucky being on welfare.  It is two entirely different issues.</p>

What I&rsquo;ve come to realize, however, is that most people are not so much swayed by truth as by fashion. The reflexive charge of &#8220;raaaacist&#8221; in response to the expression of simple race facts is designed to inhibit such discussion. A few months ago, I asked a &#8220;color blind&#8221; social constructivist type if he would be willing to admit that blacks had a lower average I.Q. than other races if it were proven true, &#8220;hypothetically,&#8221; of course. He refused to answer my question. Of course, he would NOT be willing to admit it, even if he knew for a certainty that it was true. For most people political correctness trumps the disinterested search for truth. We clear thinkers in the West must work to delegitimize pc ideology and build an ethos that rewards honest, truth-based inquiry.</p>

In the 70s and 80s, I don&rsquo;t remember one young girl having a tattoo or wierd body piercing. Most of us cared about our grades and had a job. In the 80s, it was the same, and we only had one teenage pregnancy in my high school  The pregnant single girl lived with her parents and successfully finished nursing school. She didn&rsquo;t go on welfare. The only extremely bad behavior was what we saw on shock TV, Jerry Spring type shows. Now that behavior is the norm for white youth. Ghetto culture has completely taken over surburban life. I see many young white males joining gangs, doing drugs, abandoning pregnant girlfriends, and generally acting like idiots. I see teenage white girls covered with tattoos, body piercings, while pushing baby carriages. They aren&rsquo;t going to night school for nursing either, they are on welfare. Many whites like the &#8220;gangsta&#8221; culture. It&rsquo;s much easier than the right way. This lifestyle is enabled because welfare is given out like candy. Furthmermore, the media glamorizes porn and violence.  Most people will choose the easy way, if given the chance&hellip;even low IQ whites. Left wing liberals wanted this to happen. It is part of their genocidal agenda. Higher IQ conservative whites pay for all of this, while they are demonized. Liberals and low IQ whites willfully participate in their own genocide, with pleasure.</p>

<p>The author writes, &#8220;A good case can also be made that the black underclass&rsquo; worst features are avoidable, often just by fleeing or behaving prudently.&#8221;</p>
<p>While retired professors may be able to flee, a more than substantial proportion of the American white population cannot.</p>
<p>Essentially, those whites unable to &#8220;flee&#8221; are being abondoned behind enemy lines by the millions, trapped in a hostile, even life threatening, environment which is intent on destroying their lives and the lives of their children. Additionally, white women are increasingly &#8220;enamored&#8221; of black men and black culture because they have no reasonable alternative in terms of alternative social integration amongst their fellow whites. As I walk thru Walmart and see (poor) white women (and young girls) with mixed race children, I am largely seeing the result of abandoned whites who did not have the choice of &#8220;fleeing or behaving prudently.&#8221;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-42645" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>More serious is the relentless campaign, often government financed, to remove the stigma from quintessential black underclass traits. Behavior once almost unthinkable is becoming mainstream. White illegitimacy rates now are now equal to those of blacks when Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his famous report, and more and more whites show a black underclass-like indifference towards traditional marriage and family life. What middle class mother today would warn her teenage daughter against premarital sex because &ldquo;only poor blacks do that sort of thing.&rdquo; The young lady may well attend a school where many black girls are either pregnant or already have children and suffer no consequences. Hollywood starlets routinely have out-of-wedlock births and cohabit with a steady parade of irresponsible boyfriends.</p>
<p>But, at the very top of the list of nefarious bottom-up transformations is how American society increasingly adopts, almost invisibly, the Santa Claus view of government. To put it bluntly, government is bribing many whites to behave as if they were underclass blacks. The older notion of government existing to provide only collective benefits &mdash; national defense, highways, a currency, public safety and the like &mdash; is in decline. We are instead developing a more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; understanding of government as a provider of all of life&rsquo;s requirements: food, shelter, recreation, medicine, and everything else Americans once provided for themselves through their own effort. Washington&rsquo;s job description increasingly resembles something that a black underclass member would write: a responsibility for everything. It now takes an entire bureaucracy to raise a child to adulthood &mdash; and that&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>The formula for successful contagion is simple: start by targeting the black underclass and then let politically driven mission creep ensnarl ordinary citizens. Consider, for example, government help for young children, a task once considered totally beyond government&rsquo;s role. Head Start was supposed to close learning gaps between blacks and whites, but 45 years later it is just one part of a far broader government-administered &ldquo;early intervention&rdquo; enterprise hardly limited to blacks. Similar expansions have occurred with school lunches (and now breakfasts), government subsidized housing (including mortgages), and free government medical care. In 2010, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (what used to be called &ldquo;food stamps&rdquo;) had 40.3 million recipients and was growing. An increasing proportion of these families have no cash income at all.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that much if white genetic advantage over blacks is big, small, or doesn&rsquo;t even exist. Culture exists, and it&rsquo;s big. US black culture is the perfect storm created by both horrid culture and (probably) genetics pushing them towards impulsiveness and lower IQ. Still, culture and nothing but culture can push whites to the same depths. I don&rsquo;t know about Appalachians, but the British white underclass is just about as bad as that of US black underclass. Theodore Dalrymple is probably its best documentarian and analyst. You can read his stuff from here (oldest first, as he went from the basics and important stuff to details and whims):</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/8O1fS</p>
<p>Seriously, you could use that as documentary of US black slums as well. It&rsquo;s that bad. Now, if you&rsquo;re wondering about the black British underclass? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be worse as such&hellip; But a lot more of UK blacks are part of that compared to UK whites. People talk about immigration, poverty and stuff like that, but non-Muslim Indians have thrived mightily despite having landed on British land recently and without money. Something makes the difference. Culture? Genes? Who knows. One could use the Indians as an argument for culture, but Islam in India spread mostly amongst the lowest castes due to its egalitarian message, and if the lowest castes were genetically inferior&hellip;</p>

<p><i>The underclass has been nurtured by the expansion of the welfare system that began with the War on Poverty, which was declared in 1964 by President Johnson.</i></p>
<p><i>As the good life of a production job with a strong union became increasingly inaccessible, the easy life of welfare dependency became more tempting.</i></p>
<p>Excellent points, John.  Johnson delivered the welfare state to us.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;War on Poverty&#8221; was directed at poor blacks.  Between 1950 and 1980, spending on anti-poverty programs increased 20 times, yet by 1980, the poverty rate was 22 percent, almost 70 percent higher than it was in 1969 when Johnson left office.  Food stamp use increased 50 times during that time period, AFCD use increased by 107%  and the number receiving SS Disability due to loosened standards increased by 500%</p>
<p>Blacks exited the workforce in droves when they found out the government paid them NOT to work.  Illegitimacy rates double for poor black women because more babies meant more benefits.  Marriage was out because it put an end to their benefits.</p>
<p>The result is what we have today: White American taxpayers forced to support a large non-white underclass of welfare users, baby makers, criminals and illegal aliens, leaving whites less financially able to support themselves, let alone a family.</p>

<p>Thank you for that comment, I agree completely. I used to travel for a living and made many trips to Appalachia. Yes, the people are less educated, but they&rsquo;re not stupid, they&rsquo;re just poor. There&rsquo;s not a lot of land there that can be farmed because of the topography, there&rsquo;s not a lot of industry, and there&rsquo;s not a lot of cheap land there either, because the mining companies own most of it. As a woman who travelled alone, I never felt afraid in those little towns and the people were always very nice and courteous.</p>
<p>I watched a documentary on TV a few weeks ago about a mining town in Appalachia. They interviewed an Indian doctor who worked at a clinic there. He said (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing), &#8220;People in this country may not believe this, but the people here are poorer than the people in the village where I was raised in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>From my experiences, the people of Appalachia are fine people.</p>

I live in a fast diversifying district where whites have gone from 99.8% fifty years ago to 25% now. I socialize often with what is left of the white lower working class who are forced to work, live, and socialize with diversity. There is an underlying white identity among them but there is no support for coming out white. They self-segregate as whites but they do need more help. It is not easy to be white here for the uninitiated. It can&rsquo;t go on like this forever. I wish more of you successful upper middle class whites would visit us more often. We need examples. We need reasoning. We need re-assurance. You can find a way to insert yourself into the social setting without taking on much risk. Go slow. Pretend to a lower station. Don&rsquo;t be nosey. Be easily distracted. Aside from any mission you have, be there because you like them.</p>

I am seeing this theory more and more on Amren and it is down right absurd. We intermingle with them because there are more of them down here, but we are also much more racially aware because of it. We have our own ways of separating ourselves from them and they worked quite fine until Northerners forced us to integrate with them. Get off your high horse….you have little to be proud of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  On this, I moved from the Midwest to Atlanta a few months ago. As an Amren/ White Pride enthusiast - yes, I am PROUD to be white ! (and if someone has a problem with that they can kiss it - as many whites feel embarrassment over their color these days !) - I thought it would be extremely interesting to see how blacks and whites interact in the South.</p>
<p>Frankly, often, they do not want to interact at all ! Just like the Midwest. Sometimes they are forced to (whether by circumstance or demographic)- and have the &#8216;black babies in tow.&rsquo;- never to be touched by a white man ever again. BU, in the South, whites are FAR more knowledgeable about how blacks really are.</p>
<p>Here in the midwest, it&rsquo;s COMMON to see mixed couples - pathetic- as it&rsquo;s always a black man with a white woman who appears totally busted-grossly overweight, scraggly, nasty. But they are far more ignorant on how blacks are and happily &#8216;mingle&rsquo; with them- until of course, they become pregnant and then the black guy is off, for his next white woman to impregnate. -are we ever going to get some laws put in place to MAKE these subIQ idiots RESPONSIBLE ?!</p>
<p>Southern whites are also FAR more wise when it comes to diligently being aware/ BEWARE blacks and all of their crazy behavior.</p>
<p>When blacks go on their tirades in the North, everyone turns a blind eye, in the South, whites becomes VERY aware and watchful - showing CAUTION.</p>
<p>On the issue of the juggalos, this is simply whites who like rap music that is played by other whites. Is this bad ? Are they wrong because they want to go to a concert and dress like the performers ? Is everyone in the world supposed to fit into the &#8216;Barry Manilow mold&rsquo; like the original poster on this issue probably does ?  Wake up people and stop being so damned ignorant. Let people live their lives without being so damned judgmental !</p>
<p>If whites don&rsquo;t stick together, you&rsquo;re just like the blacks- backbiting at every opportunity- to rip each other off to make a buck. Wait, I just accidentally described White Corporate America - funny and sad.</p>

Indians, who had a inferiority complex vis-a-vis lighter skinned N Indians with sharper features, tried emulating rap (albeit an Indianized version) in the early 90&#8242;s, but the movement quickly died out. I guess the majority of S. Indians didn&rsquo;t want to degrade themselves to the level of blacks.</p>
<p>As a recent trend, the opposite is happening. Many S. Indians have formed death metal and heavy rock bands, which have always been whites&rsquo; preserves. Most of those band members have relatively dark skin. Some of the talent out there seems good. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a couple of the bands make it big over the next decade.</p>
<p>The point is, no one from around the world wants to embrace black culture other than w*****s.</p>

<p>I bear no ill will against any ethnic or religious group but am merely stating the obvious. . . if I am mistaken, I will be the FIRST to admit the &#8220;error of my ways&#8221; and look forward to replies in this forum.</p>
<p>There was a large jewish component to the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; (for some) movement in the 1960&#8242;s.  Most of the jewish involvement WAS due to a sense of &#8220;social justice&#8221;; jews, having been marginalized for much of their existence saw the same thing in their &#8220;fellow blacks&#8221; and wanted to do something about it.  However, there was a dark sinister component that was a part of the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; (for some) movement that exists to this very day.</p>
<p>The destruction of the &#8220;freedom of association&#8221; and the enforcement of &#8220;fair housing&#8221; and &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; laws has done much to assure the destruction of individual freedom in American society.</p>
<p>The main recipients of this destruction have been the white race and especially the white(non-jewish) male.</p>
<p>Every other ethnic group (jews included) has been able to keep their &#8220;exclusiveness&#8221; and cultural homogeneity while the white &#8220;race&#8221; has been &#8220;forced&#8221; to accept all comers (to our detriment).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the ACLU, a primarily jewish-run organization (with communist roots).  This organization constantly goes after Christian involvement in the &#8220;public sphere&#8221; while giving their own (jewish) and muslim involvement a &#8220;pass&#8221;.  Most people are not aware of the &#8220;public schools&#8221; in some new york communities that are for &#8220;jews only&#8221;.  If the situation were reversed, the ACLU would be all over this case.  The so-called &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; would have a field day with it.</p>
<p>The same goes for other cultures that refuse to assimilate into our uniquely American culture . . .</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians, I did happen to catch five minutes of the show. A White woman and a black man were in a bedroom with the White woman standing and the black man on the bed. The black man was asking the White woman about her bowel movements. Of course, this is done to shock viewers and keep the ratings up. This kind of shock entertainment has become the norm and everyone is trying to make a name for themselves by being increasingly outrageous. The result is a downward spiral of perversion in a race to get noticed and become famous. The more outragous, the more &#8216;buzz&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I have no first hand knowledge of the people of Appalachia. While I&rsquo;ve been told these people are poor, uneducated, and there is am underclass of meth users, the difference between White Appalachians and black urban youth is that poor White drug users and abusers aren&rsquo;t killing each other over drugs and turf wars.</p>
<p>The excuse that black crime is the result of being poor, uneducated, and drug-fueled is a diversion blacks use to blame everything and everyone else for their pathological behavior.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s like the late US Senator Byrd referring to the low wealth and lesser educated in West Virgina as &ldquo;white n-g-e-s.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you and all the posters who take exception to the use of various pejorative terms for the Scots-Irish based culture of the Appalachians.  These people are probably the most historically independent, self-reliant, and traditional Americans of all.  They made up the majority of troops during the Revolutionary War and many of the first pioneers into territories Westward were of this stock.  They are much like the Amish in that they have held onto older ways and traditions.  Even though they don&rsquo;t supply us with the top scientists and other intellectual masters, they have always been the keepers of white traditions, as seen in the music of The Carter Family, etc.</p>
<p>The main traditional problem for them was the punitive whiskey tax imposed to pay for the Revolutionary War.  They rebelled against that and as some may recall, Washington, their former general and hero sent troops to suppress it.  This set up an antagonism with the Federal system from the start is is at the heart of many a conservative who feels that government ought to stay out of people&rsquo;s lives.  Of course, the contradiction in that is that they also often feel that it is okay for the government to intervene in others lives if it fits their own personal beliefs.  It&rsquo;s a conundrum, but it&rsquo;s an American one.  Writers ought to keep this in mind when penning any essay on the subject. Using such terms creates or reinforces divisions among whites.  The creation or perpetuation of anti-white stereotypes can only set up white elitism among ourselves.  Clearer understanding of history would eliminate it.</p>

<p>&hellip;&#8221;I understand the context that the author does it in, but the author appropriately didn&rsquo;t make this a North/South issue. On the contrary the author talks about it as if it is a nationwide problem and even mentions the problems in Britain. This is hardly a &ldquo;Southern&rdquo; issue. And again, I understand where the author is coming from in saying that whites on welfare in Appalachia are in a sense immitating blacks, but he by no means is implying that it is intentional in this sense, and that should be obvious. You on the other hand lose me when you try to connect whites becoming juggalos to whites in Kentucky being on welfare. It is two entirely different issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am with you and understand what you are saying.  I have many cousins in Northern states who ally with the traditional black and minority causes, despite clear before-thier-eyes proof of the folly of it.  The main cause of this seems to have been threefold; one is Lutheran and other Protestant brands of Christianity, COMBINED with a long enough period of ISOLATION from the facts of integration that they resist every proof of its harm to them and the nation.  A third reason is that many of the settlers in the Midwest in the 19th century from Kansas to Wisconsin were Germans.  They read German and many read Marx&rsquo;s Das Kapital and agreed with its ideas.  Wisconsin resisted being a state ONLY until they saw the benefits gained by other surrounding territories that became states before them.  There was a Marxist (Labor) uprising in Wisconsin in 1889 (therabouts).  Federal troops were required to put it down. But they were the first state to form Unions.  They did some good in helping create tolerable working conditions for everyone.  But this IS one of the root causes of the current public workers protests.  They have come to a point where standing up for unions in ANY circumstance, even if they are not necessary (and they aren&rsquo;t in that situation), is a reflex.  They seize upon &#8220;60s Civil Rights imagery and slogans like droids.  Similarly, they draw comparisons to themselves and The Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East, which only have mobs in common. This is done completely blind to the fact that they are only seeking to protect their own tax paid, bureaucratic based jobs as a right. The resistance to this is also deep seated in the region.  Before the Germans and other late 19th century Eastern European immigrants came, those areas were mostly peopled by French Canadians.  (My 5th great grandfather was one of the first white men in Michigan territory).  They were a very independent set of hard-core pioneers.  Remember, Joseph McCarthy was a senator from Wisconsin.  His wild-eyed, &#8220;commie everywhere&#8221; mentality was fueled by this even by then, old, deep set tension.  From Michigan to Minnesota, and wherever they have spread, this is a brand of social activism separate from for example, the Noam Chomsky style, New York type.  The longstanding political tension in that area (and I was born in Wisconsin) makes for a highly contradictory personality type.  It is the Grand Central Station of the tradition wherein family members of different political opinions are estranged.  There is often ZERO tolerance for descent, even among loved ones.  And they tend to consider themselves superior, morally, to any Southern white.  I keep hoping more of them will begin to see the light and adjust to reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;If no government, hard core objectivist libertarian whites want to talk the racial identitist talk, they should consider what can be done to rescue their white brethren in danger a little more. In the wealthy, the concept is known as &ldquo;noblesse oblige&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s from long before either Adam Smith or Karl Marx raised their ugly heads. &#8221;</p>
<p>The larger point of &#8220;oblige noblesse&#8221; is that the tradition was meant to build one&rsquo;s personal consciousness of the &#8220;Christian&#8221; obligation of supporting the poor, along with the politically practical notion of being popular - preventing revolution through responsible rule.  But Marxism and some of the current OWS rhetoric demands that this be institutionalized.  I mean I heard one protester interviewed who used the term and said that they government had a &#8220;oblige noblesse&#8221; to the people.  This is a great example of the civic illiteracy of many of the protesters, who present so many impossible demands, or demands that would provide no basis for any functioning system.</p>

<p>On the surface it might appear so.  But there is blatant discrimination against Whites in every goverment program from section 8, food stamps, free medical care, senior housing, scholarships, SBA loans, disability and even workmen&rsquo;s comp.</p>
<p>About the only program that does not discriminate is social security.  That goes strictly by years worked and money earned.</p>
<p>It is all done by computer now.  When social security was still done by social security employees the black slugs delighted in delaying payments to Whites for a year or more after the White applicant turned 65 and applied.</p>
<p>It happened to my Father.  He went to work at 18,retired at 67.  He worked only 2 jobs his entire life.  One was a railroad.  The other was a huge national manufacturer.  No way those payments could have been lost in the system.</p>
<p>The social security office was of course staffed entirely by black slugs.  After 19 months delay because the slugs claimed they could not find his payment records our congressman stepped in.</p>
<p>People who work many jobs for short periods for small companies often find their payment record a mess.  But my Dad worked just 2 jobs for major companies for 50 years. The black slugs were just using their power to harm a White man.</p>
<p>I agree with everything the author says.  But the discrimination against Whites in benefits is blatant.  I believe that in my state about 87 percent of Whites are turned down for disability as opposed to only 53 percent minorities.</p>

<p>I remember reading some years ago about the SAT scores of various states.  W. Virginia had very high SAT scores compared to the north eastern and midwestern states with their large cities infested with blacks.</p>
<p>I thought the hillbilly references racist and offensive.  Had the author used the word Jews or Catholics the ADL and that Catholic defense group would have jumped all over him.</p>
<p>For one thing, the White areas of the south east have the lowest crime rates whether  ultra wealthy Mclean Virgina or Poverty Hollow W. Virginia.</p>
<p>Race, not income is the reason.</p>
<p>Washington DC has some of the highest rates of crime, useless schools, and general black pathology in the country.  DC blacks are also the richest blacks in the country due to the supreme court gift of goverment jobs.</p>
<p>What other pathologies is he talking about?  That old myth of incest?  Not true.  Low IQ? not true.  It was the Scots Irish mountain folk who were brought here as a perimeter defense in the mountains to defend the wealthy coastal plantation and trading areas.</p>
<p>The women and children of the Scots Irish fought the Indians as well as the men while the plantation owners and hypocritical virtous Christian quaker merchants of Philly made money.</p>
<p>That hillibillies are as bad as blacks comes from sociology books of the 1940&#8242;s and 1950&#8242;s.  When it was noted that the blacks brought to the north to work in manufacturing  were rioting and when not rioting robbing, pillaging, raping and murderering, the soocilogists claimed that the White southern immigrants to the manufacturing north were just as bad as the black immigrants.</p>
<p>It was not true then and it is not true now.  The sociologists never of the era never claimed that the European immigrants to the big manufacturing cities were as criminal as the blacks.</p>
<p>It was always those evil hillbilly morons.</p>
<p>I wonder what would have happened if southern Whites had refused to fight in WW1 and 2?</p>
<p>I wonder what will happen to our military now that it is nothing but another affirmative action goverment agency?</p>
<p>The fact that southern Whites survived reconstruction, the coal mines and the economic colonialization after the Civil War is testimony to their intellegence, stanima and strong social networks and ability to make the best of what they had.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t.  Even when Whites grow up on welfare, they don&rsquo;t turn out as badly as middle class blacks.  Whites on welfare get SAT scores average 350 points higher that blacks whose parents earn over $70,000 per year.  Poor White sons of White single mothers do not fill the prisons.  Poor White children do not terrorize their teachers and schools.</p>
<p>Joseph Kay is like a lot of observers.  He thinks that blacks are the way they are because their parents are divorced or never married, because they are poor, because they like trashy music and wear baggy pants.</p>
<p>I have worked years with very  well paid civil service blacks. School principals making $125,000 per year for instance.  Their children often grow up to be far worse than Whites on welfare.</p>
<p>Perhaps Kay threw in that bit about hillbillies for the same reason certain people need to post articles about superior chinese, korean and japanese IQ, to avoid charges of racism from the usual suspects.</p>
<p>Whites do not behave like blacks. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Kay&rsquo;s article reminds me a lot of so called conservatives who endlessly talk about welfare, single parents and crime while dancing around the racial issue.  Has he ever written an article blaming Detroit&rsquo;s problems on unions?  I would not be surprised if he did.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t respond to every point about your comment, except to suggest that any up-turning of Northern noses on the far-right might be a response to hearing a century and a half of  Neo-Confederate rants, complete with circular arguments in defense of the peculiar abomination what brought Africans to this country.</p>
<p>I have a great respect for truly racially aware Southerners like James Edwards and Jared Tailor, but not for trashy types no matter how racist they might be. The first are men of dignity and are the true, proud, and SELF-AWARE  defenders of white civilization; the later just ignorant jerks.</p>
<p>When we encounter on a daily basis Southerners proudly claiming to be &#8220;part-Cherokee&#8221; or Lumbee, and read about hillbilly groups like the Melungeons, it only naturally brings us to question the racial awareness- indeed, even the racial integrity- of common whites in the South. No amount of &#8220;nuh uh&#8221; from Southern activists will change what we see with our own eyes.</p>
<p>Regarding &#8220;juggalos&#8221;, I do not associate that phenomenon with the South particularly but with rural inland-America generally- it is indeed centered on the mid-west. I never denied that the white underclass was everywhere, and even pointed out that it is even worse in ever-snooty England. Look, I don&rsquo;t have data for how many whites imitate blacks, broken down by region. I doubt collecting such data is even possible. For such an issue, therefore, I simply will go by years personal experience and observation.</p>
<p>Which is to say that I will stereotype and be judgmental, and defamatory as need  be. Shame and judgement are some of the bedrock themes of Northern society, far higher than familial solidarity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anybody who watches Oprah besides a single homosexual man, as she is mostly irrelevant to my age group. I guess a certain number of Northern (old) white women appear on Oprah&rsquo;s program, but so what? If it is tit-for-tat, then I&rsquo;ll simply point out Nancy Grace.</p>

<p>Back when I was a child in the 70s, my mom would come home from her job and tell me about people she saw that have more and more children outside of marriage just to get welfare benefits.  This was nearly 40 years ago!!!  And she said it was always black people and I thought she was either exaggerating, was a racist, or both.  Well, she was and is not a racist and was not exaggerating.  Now, we all know the truth.  My sister and I never had children because we&rsquo;ve never been able to afford them.  Why?  Because we have never been dependent on a man, the government or anyone else, and because there are so many that are, and we&rsquo;re paying for them.</p>

<p>You are, of course, correct. But I still think White people should seek a higher standard for themselves than being &#8220;better than blacks&#8221;. We used to tower above Asians! We are the highest creation of God, and our civilization the crowning achievement of mankind. We should try to start act like it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Correction: America&rsquo;s underclass (and under bus) comprises non-wealthy heterosexual white males, especially those under 30.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are misusing the word &#8220;underclass&#8221;, I suppose sarcastically. But &#8220;non-wealthy heterosexual white males, especially those under 30&#8243; (which is to say, my demographic) ARE a growing element of the underclass. I see it every day. I hear and see plenty &#8220;non-wealthy heterosexual white males, especially those under 30&#8243; working off the books whilst collecting unemployment, using EBT cards for buying drug paraphernalia, making babies they cannot support with women they are not married to, stealing from friends and well-intentioned care-givers, and etc. I have fallen for their tricks before, and they have killed my support for unconditional white solidarity.</p>
<p>No, they are not so bad as blacks. But not people of great worth or virtue either.</p>
<p>The underclass is not the same as the White poor, although poor Whites often get dragged into the underclass. Poor whites can be people of good morals, but the underclass is defined by it&rsquo;s trashiness and immorality.</p>
<p>I lived for five months with a guy from North Carolina, who I allowed to stay in my dorm room at college because he was homeless. Although very crude at times, also a person of high moral character- and he never stole from me or anyone else, or showed disloyalty to his girlfriend. He spent time looking for jobs that he could have spent on the welfare line or whining about his condition. And those little things make all the difference. He still has temptations to return to drug use and the underclass life he had before, but he hangs in there. I can&rsquo;t help but feel that if only he could have a chance, he would be able and willing to escape it completely.</p>
<p>But most of the white male underclass (and I have been amongst it first-hand) has no desire to better themselves, so screw &#8216;em.</p>

<p>Whites are less able to support families because of changes in the economy and tax system that favor capital at the expense of labor. These are the same changes that have made welfare an attractive option for millions of Americans. Most men would rather earn a lower middle class income than qualify for welfare. Most women would rather be married to a man with a lower middle class income than have illegitimate children by fly by night lovers.</p>
<p>For psychological reasons many white men would rather blame their declining incomes on the civil rights movement and the war on poverty than acknowledge that they are less useful to employers than their fathers were.</p>

<p>Giving the benefit of the doubt half of them are somewhat lawabiding and work who stay clear of crime taking it down to .75%. .75% of the 36 million is 270,000 active criminals on the streets of American urban centers committing violent criminal acts 24/7/365 at any given time.</p>

<p>&#8220;At some level, my students understand the same thing. One day I asked the bored, black faces staring back at me. &ldquo;What would happen if all the white people in America disappeared</p>

<p>&ldquo;We screwed,&rdquo; a young, pitch-black boy screamed back. The rest of the blacks laughed.</p>

<p>Punitive? Whiskey needs to be taxed, just like any other commodity. Wars are expensive and need to be paid for, and taxes are how it is done.</p>
<p>Of course, that assumes the government is legitimate. Today, that is questionable.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the issue of the juggalos, this is simply whites who like rap music that is played by other whites. Is this bad ? Are they wrong because they want to go to a concert and dress like the performers ? Is everyone in the world supposed to fit into the &lsquo;Barry Manilow mold&rsquo; like the original poster on this issue probably does ? Wake up people and stop being so damned ignorant. Let people live their lives without being so damned judgmental ! &#8221;</p>
<p>I refuse! They d*mn well need a wake-up shock! I am so sick of Juggalos complaining that no one will hire them (because they dress like the black underclass and have rap sheets a mile long) and that they have to sell weed to make money. I am sick of them running around breaking into cars to make rent money, and sick of going to Juggalo funerals and seeing the already-dour faces of their loved ones.</p>
<p>You seem to think a Juggalo is merely a fan, but no it is a whole stupid and degenerate lifestyle, a synthesis of hippy, black, and white-trash cultural norms.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who Barry Manilow is, but I think all whites should strive for the ideal of the chivalric nobleman-at-arms. It is not necessary to be perfect, but it is necessary to strive towards it.</p>
<p>Striving to be a &#8220;menace to society&#8221; is not something I respect.</p>

<p>Every race and culture has an underclass and the most detrimental aspect of any underclass is its propensity for violence.  Blacks dominate the field of violence &#038; mayhem in every country in which they reside.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the end it is not whether one person or one race exhibits negativities but just how other races react to such negativities.  The simple fact of the matter is all races are happier in homogenous societies where history and culture is respected, integrity and morality are desired and pursued, parasitic behavior is ostracized, and violence is not tolerated nor goes unpunished.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, of course, correct. But I still think White people should seek a higher standard for themselves than being &ldquo;better than blacks&rdquo;. We used to tower above Asians! We are the highest creation of God, and our civilization the crowning achievement of mankind. We should try to start act like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know why we used to tower above Asians? It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re really born better than them. It seems they have a slight genetic advantage in some things, we in others. From the collapse of Roman Empire to 18th century China was undoubtedly the most civilized and sophisticated nation in the world. However, precisely that thing was what hamstrung them, and by lesser extent all Asians, and made them stand still twiddling their thumbs while we raced ahead. They were so civilized that they thought they were the only real civilization, the crowning achievement of mankind. It&rsquo;s not like some smelly, racially alien barbarians sailing around in some stupid ships could be any real threat, right? Even when they showed they knew some really interesting things (clocks, superior cannons and astronomy, etc.), they were just fancy tricks and probably were ripping off Chinese knowledge anyway. Yawn. Back to calligraphy.</p>
<p>In the end, of course, they had to eat dirt and face utter humiliation. I don&rsquo;t suppose Asia will ever become as superior over West as West was over Asia back then, but it&rsquo;ll be scant consolation if we don&rsquo;t get our act back together. A nasty shock is probably needed to get us out of our complacency, but hopefully it won&rsquo;t get to the point where we&rsquo;ll have others lording it over us.</p>
<p>And no, &#8220;being better than [ghetto] blacks&#8221;, or for that matter the very worst of white underclass, is indeed not enough. It&rsquo;s merely the minimum standard one has to achieve in order to qualify for the opportunity to start earning respect.</p>
