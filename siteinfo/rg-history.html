				History
			</h2>
			<p>
				For anyone brought up on the cartoon history taught in American schools, it is a surprise to learn what really happened in the past. The egalitarian left unabashedly distorts history in the name of orthodoxy. It is our job to resurrect the truth.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1995/05/index.html">Selma to Montgomery, 30 Years Later</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				The 1965 march Montgomery, Alabama, is considered one of the great triumphs of the civil rights era. You will be startled to learn of the degeneracy of the marchers who descended on the small town of Selma. Journalists were amazed, too, and were annoyed when their candid accounts were edited out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do not overlook the accompanying articles, especially &ldquo;The Many Deaths of Viola Liuzzo.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1995/09/index.html">The War with Mexico</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Mexico wanted war with the United States in 1846 and believed it would win. The dictator at the time, General Mariano Paredes, boasted that he would not negotiate with the Americans until the Mexican flag flew over the capitol in Washington. After they were defeated, the Mexicans ratified the exchange of territory by accepting payment.
			</p>
			<p>
				This article sets the record straight.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2001/08/index.html#article2">How They Got the Vote</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Alexander Keyssar, <i>The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States</i>, Basic Books, 2000, $30.00, 467 pp.
			</p>
			<p>
				From colonial times until well after the Civil War, most states severely restricted the franchise: to men, property owners, whites, taxpayers, etc. This review details how those restrictions were slowly broken down, and describes the crucial role of the federal government in determining who could vote, a power that had been traditionally reserved to the states.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2005/08/index.html#article1">The Untold Story of White Slavery</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Robert C. Davis, <i>Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500-1800</i>, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, 246 pp., $35.00.
			</p>
			<p>
				This review is filled with startling facts about the European slaves taken by Muslim raiders from about 1500 to 1800. Slave raids went as far as Iceland, and might return with as many 7,000 captive whites. Galley slaves were worked until they died and then tossed overboard. An amazing corner of history that is largely ignored.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1996/05/index.html#article5">Black Slaveowners</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Larry Koger, <i>Black Slaveowners: Free Black Slave Masters in South Carolina, 1790-1860</i>, University of South Carolina Press, 1985, 286 pp. $14.95.
			</p>
			<p>
				This review uncovers yet another neglected part of history: the readiness with which free blacks took to owning slaves. This study is limited to South Carolina, but lays to rest the myth that blacks bought slaves only for the purpose of freeing their relatives. Profit and prestige were the main motives.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/08/index.html">The Black-Jewish Alliance</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Cheryl Greenberg, <i>Troubling the Waters: Black-Jewish Relations in the American Century</i>, Princeton University Press, 2006, 351 pp., $29.95.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jews have long been active in minority causes. This book traces the history of that involvement, describes Jewish motives for siding with blacks, and describes the divergence of interests that finally derailed the black-Jewish alliance. A detailed and informative review.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/12/index.html#article1">Slavery in the New World</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				David Brion Davis, <i>Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World</i>, Oxford University Press, 440 pp., $30.00.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reviewer deplores the anti-&ldquo;racist&rdquo; preening of the author but passes along countless fascinating facts about slavery in the Western Hemisphere. This book is one of the most comprehensive histories of slavery in the Americas.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/2006/07/index.html#article2">The Man Who Invented White Guilt</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Raymond Wolters, <i>Du Bois and His Rivals, </i>University of Missouri Press, 2002, 311 pp., $39.95 (softcover, $19.95).
			</p>
			<p>
				W.E.B. Du Bois had an enormous impact on the way both blacks and whites think about race. This book lays bear the anti-white animus, the single-mindedness, and the out-and-out Communism of one of the most influential blacks in American history. It also describes the deep involvement of whites in the establishment of the NAACP.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1998/02/index.html">The King Holiday and Its Meaning</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Sam Francis explains the tremendous significance of making Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s birthday a national holiday, and describes the work of several southern senators who tried to block the holiday. Francis also explains why there were no Senate hearings on the holiday &mdash; and what those hearings might have brought to light.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<a href="/ar/1997/12/index.html">Madison Grant and the Racialist Movement</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				George McDaniel describes the career of the distinguished white activist Madison Grant. Our movement has deep roots among the best men of America&rsquo;s past.
