				How to Use This Site
			</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to AmRen.com &mdash; the best source on the Internet for race-realist information and perspectives. We invite you to use the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><a href="/news/index.html">Breaking News</a></strong>. Every business day we post news stories from around the world about race and immigration. Comments to news stories often give rise to lively &mdash; and, of course, polite &mdash; debate.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="/archives/index.html">Research</a></strong>. All news stories are archived by date. Even more usefully, all stories are archived by subject.</li>
				<li>This is a very powerful research tool. The stories are categorized into dozens of subjects: Immigration law enforcement, race and intelligence, anti-white crime, etc. Click on a subject and you have an instant research archive. Many of these news stories are no longer posted at their original locations, so AmRen.com is the only place you can find them online.</li>
				<li>If you can&rsquo;t find a story by date or subject search the entire AmRen.com site by keyword from the search box on the home page.</li>
				<li><em>American Renaissance</em> was a  monthly print magazine from November 1990 until January 2012. Our <a href="/archives/back-issues.html">back issues</a> are a treasure trove of classic race-realism. You can read each issue in HTML format or look at a PDF of the paper issue.</li>
				<li>There is a graduate education to be found in the back issues, so just go browsing &mdash; or for suggestions about classic articles on key subjects, we invite you to use our <a href="/"><em>AR</em> Reader&rsquo;s Guide</a> here.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="/store.html">The AR Store</a></strong>. Here you can find race-realist books, and buy DVDs of every talk ever given at our conferences.</li>
				<li>You can also <a href="/donate.html">make a donation</a> for which we will be deeply grateful. <span style="color: #990000;">We get no support from corporations, charities, or government.</span> If you believe that a realistic understanding of race is essential to the survival of the West, please make a donation.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="/archives/interviews.html">Interviews</a></strong>. Some people like to listen to our arguments as well as read them. We offer a selection of interviews with AR&rsquo;s editor, <a href="/about/jared-taylor.html">Jared Taylor</a>. His appearances with Queen Latifa, Phil Donohue, and Frank Whalen are especially popular.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="/contact.html">Send <em>us</em> Stories</a></strong>. We are grateful to supporters all around the world who send us articles we post on AR News. The form for sending stories is here.</li>
				<li>We welcome original articles for posting on the site and for use in the magazine. If you have something you would like to publish, please <a href="/contact.html">send it here</a>. Before you put a lot of work into an article, it is a good idea to send us a query.</li>
