			  <p>An anti-illegal immigration group, the San Diego Minutemen, is trying to pull two Latino lawmakers into its legal clash with the California Department of Transportation.<br/><br/>Attorneys for the group have asked a federal judge for permission to expand their free speech lawsuit against the state agency. They want to add Assemblyman Joe Coto (D-San Jose) and state Sen. Gilbert Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) to the defendant list. They also want to ask for punitive damages, court documents show.<br/><br/>Minutemen attorney Howard Kaloogian, a former state assemblyman, accused the lawmakers Thursday of urging Caltrans to ban the group from participating in the state's Adopt-a-Highway program.<br/><br/>The Minutemen sued Caltrans in February after the agency revoked the group's permit to pick up trash along a stretch of Interstate 5, near the Border Patrol checkpoint. Caltrans also removed a courtesy sign with the group's name.<br/><br/>Kaloogian filed the request to amend the suit Monday in U.S. District Court.<br/><br/>&quot;We have uncovered an active conspiracy to obviously deny our clients their constitutional rights,&quot; he said. &quot;This deserves to be punished.&quot;<br/><br/>Coto and Cedillo, leaders of the state Latino Legislative Caucus, could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.<br/><br/>It will be up to Judge William Q. Hayes whether the Minutemen can file an amended complaint. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 27.<br/><br/>When Caltrans revoked the permit, officials said the activists' presence along the busy highway could lead to vandalism or confrontations. The Minutemen accused the agency of bowing to political pressure.<br/><br/>In June, Hayes ordered Caltrans to replace the sign while the lawsuit was pending. There was &quot;little, if any, evidence&quot; it would endanger the public, the judge said.<br/><br/>If Hayes determines that the Minutemen can amend their complaint, the activists would claim damages &quot;in excess of &#036;50,000,&quot; court documents show.<br/><br/>The group also plans to allege that Coto and Cedillo worked with Caltrans to &quot;silence the Minutemen's message and remove the Minutemen's presence from public view,&quot; court documents show.<br/><br/>The Minutemen point to a letter that the two lawmakers wrote to Caltrans director, Will Kempton, in January that said &quot;the most prudent approach in avoiding any future violence and discrimination&quot; would be revoking the Minutemen's permit and removing their sign.<br/><br/>Minutemen founder Jeff Schwilk has repeatedly denied that his group advocates violence or discrimination.<br/><br/>Caltrans attorney Jeffrey Benowitz did not return a call seeking comment Thursday.<br/><br/>Contact staff writer Craig TenBroeck at (760) 901-4062 or <a href="mailto:ctenbroeck@nctimes.com">ctenbroeck@nctimes.com</a>.</p>

It is about time ... politicians are held accountable for their [alleged] abuse of power.  Starting here in California is good.  Maybe after a few of these crooks get caught and punished for their actions, some of the rest of the people who pretend to represent the citizens of the US will get the message that they cannot use thier office to further their corrupt and disruptive agendas.  Sacramento needs to get cleaned out to be followed by Washington DC.  It's as simple as just vote for someone besides the incumbant in November.  That will be a good start to getting our state and country back on track.</span></p>

It seems the Mexican Government through their consulate, activists like Morones, and the Mexican Caucus in Sacramento overstepped their bounds big time in pressuring the state to violate the U.S. Constitution and the free speech rights of the Minutemen. I hope this case sets a landmark example to those who would side with commerce and political pressure to violate the LAW! Can't wait to see Gil Cedillo and Lori Saldana on the stand during the trial!

Being an intelligent person that everyone knows you are, we didn't assume that you meant to do this on purpose. We know you really meant &quot;illegal aliens&quot;, but you were probably preoccupied with whether McCain or Obama would give &quot;immigrants&quot; amnesty. Well, no ones perfect.</span></p>

Does that sound right? Do you like that explaination. Is it O.K. if the predjudiced &quot;gringo&quot; can live among you? I know that Gringo and White scum on the posters of the hundreds of thousands of marchers in Los Angeles a while back, doesn't really mean Mexicans are as prejudiced as Europeans, I just thought they had a moral slip for a few days during those marches, otherwise everyone knows illegal aliens from Mexico can do no wrong.
