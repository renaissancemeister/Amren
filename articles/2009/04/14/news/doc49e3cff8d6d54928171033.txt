					<br/>BLOOMINGTON -- A 19-year-old Bloomington man was charged Monday after police said up to a dozen teenagers blocked the street near Oak and Mulberry early Saturday afternoon and harassed a woman in her car.<br/><br/>Brett Lane, 19, of the 900 block of West Olive Street, was charged with aggravated battery, court documents said.<br/><br/>The woman, 24, was driving near Mulberry and Oak streets a few minutes after noon while on her way to visit her brother, 34, who lives in the 500 block of North Mason Street, police said. When the brother came up and asked the group to let his sister’s car through, he was jumped by four or five teens, police said.<br/><br/>While the man was beaten, others in the mob threw rocks, bricks and debris at the sister and two of the brother’s roommates, police said.<br/><br/>The woman’s brother had an open head wound on his forehead, police spokesman Duane Moss said. There were no reports of ambulances at the scene, but victims may have gotten medical help later, Moss said.<br/><br/>Some screamed racially derogatory names, Moss said. One person yelled, “This is our neighborhood, white boy,” Moss said.<br/><br/>The teenagers were black, Moss said.<br/><br/>Police do not know why the group surrounded the car or fought with the three roommates, Moss said.<br/><br/>There is no indication the victims knew the attackers, but the incident is being treated as a hate crime, Moss said. Police continue to investigate.<br/><br/>Police were called at 12:24 p.m. Saturday, and the crowd scattered as soon as they approached, Moss said.<br/><br/>Moss said Lane demanded police arrest the woman’s brother, claiming he had hit Lane with a beer can.<br/><br/>Lane was the only person arrested as of Monday.<br/><br/>While Lane initially was booked on additional, preliminary charges, the aggravated battery charge was the only one filed by prosecutors on Monday.<br/><br/>Lane was jailed in lieu of posting $1,000. <div class="storyunderbox" id="storyunderbox">

They've already worked all their lives, paid their taxes, and just want to enjoy some peace and security.  Are they suppose to get two jobs and move to the cookie-cutter world of the east side???....The problem is not the social or economic standing of the citizens... The problem lies with the individuals who need to be taken off the streets for good.  Despite budget issues, we need  a greater police presence, more arrests, more convictions without pleas, and long long sentencing; and we need it to start now. &quot;</div><br/></p>

Did that dribble just come out of your mouth. I have heard some idiotic statements but this one deserves an award all itself. Being poor does not mean you have to harass and tournament others. This was not a young teenager going and stealing a loaf of bread because he was hungry.  <br/><br/>Did you read the article or at least get someone to read it for you? You blame this on the person that went to see her brother and the section 8 housing residents. So I have to go move and get a better job so I don't get killed that is what you are saying.  <br/>Lets pick what is behind door number 2 JOHN. How about they judges enforce striker guidelines so these kids are forced to be at home with ankle bracelet on if they are caught outside after dark. How about some responsibility on their part John. &quot;</div><br/></p>

What living in a free country meant to them was that you should be able to do whatever you wanted treat anyone any way you wanted unless someone was strong enough to make you stop.

How about this plan to help solve some of the crime and economy issues. Build more prisons and use the ones already built. By doing this we would improve the economy by putting many people, tradesman, manufacturing, administrative etc. to work and reduce prison lay-offs. By building more prisons, helping the economy, we could have truth in criminal sentencing and therefore reducing, at the very least deterring crime. If someone really thought they may spend life in prison for murder, or 15 years for selling drugs, or 10 year for robbery, maybe they would actually give it a second thought before they did something stupid and illegal. just a thought. &quot;</div><br/></p>

This is not a few teenagers beating each other up on the playground. Last time I checked twelve black men surrounding a vehicle for no other purpose then to allegedly harass and attack someone was not considered a fight. What happens is they move into a neighborhood and try to intimidate people around them so they can claim territory. I have lived in Seattle most of my life and can speak intelligently on the subject. This is with most races they get territorial. Have you ever studied Apes in the wild, until they get into a group they are fine, once into a group of their own they become territorial. &quot;</div><br/></p>

It comes down to heightening police presence and cracking down with a zero tolerance policy for the little crimes like drinking in public and j-walking.

I say minimum 10 year prison sentence for each offender found guilty in this crime. This 19 yr old will talk and rat out the rest. There is no honor among these idiots. &quot;</div><br/></p>

Such brazen behaviour by these animals. <br/>Where are the so called community leaders or parents or other loud-mouth Sharptons that demand action whenever they feel slighted? This is an insight into the racist reality of the black community. <br/>For now I am shaken, this is only the beginning of a long troubled summer I fear. &quot;</div><br/></p>
