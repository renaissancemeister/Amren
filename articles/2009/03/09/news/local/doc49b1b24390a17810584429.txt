<p>A Lakeview Elementary parent is upset the audience of a school program on Martin Luther King Jr. was asked to stand for a song known as the black national anthem.<br/><br/>Two teachers performed the song, &ldquo;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing&rdquo; &mdash; known to some as the &ldquo;Black National Anthem&rdquo; &mdash; as part of a 15-minute program during Black History Month.<br/><br/>Russ Roberts, who has a first-grade daughter and fourth-grade son at Lakeview, said he was shocked when the audience was asked to stand for the song after it was identified as the &ldquo;Black National Anthem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said he doesn&rsquo;t object to the song, but the way it was presented gave the mistaken impression to students that there are two national anthems.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like how it was presented to parents and students,&rdquo; he said.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I looked all over the map of the world and couldn&rsquo;t find a country called black.&rdquo;<br/><br/>King stood for desegregation, and having the audience stand for a &ldquo;Black National Anthem&rdquo; promotes segregation and leads to polarization and bias,&nbsp; he said. And it confused his children, he said.<br/><br/>In a letter responding to his concerns, Principal Sudie Bock said the teachers intended to show respect for the historical journey and contributions of African Americans in United States history.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It was never intended to suggest or replace our country&rsquo;s national anthem,&rdquo; she wrote.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; is taught to students as part of the fourth-grade curriculum, Bock said.<br/><br/>She also said she would make sure teachers clarify to students that it is the only national anthem, and to clarify the historical purpose of &ldquo;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Roberts said he enjoyed the rest of the program but worries that trying to explain to students about the song will further confuse them.<br/><br/>The song was originally a poem written by James Weldon Johnson and first performed as part of a celebration of Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s birthday in 1900.<br/><br/>Johnson&rsquo;s brother set it to music in 1905 and the NAACP adopted it as the Negro National Anthem in 1919. It has remained an expression of the black American experience.<br/><br/>The song sparked controversy last summer, when a singer asked to perform the national anthem before the Denver mayor&rsquo;s state of the city address replaced the lyrics of &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; with &ldquo;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The song is sung in many settings, including at churches and the city&rsquo;s annual Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast.<br/><br/>The Rev. Joseph Lowery quoted from the song during the closing prayer at President Barack Obama&rsquo;s swearing-in ceremony, as did the Rev. Sharon Watkins when she preached at the National Prayer Service the day after his inauguration.<br/><br/>Thomas Christie, LPS multicultural school/community administrator, said if Roberts&rsquo; children were confused, he has a valid point, which teachers are addressing.<br/><br/>The teachers&rsquo;&nbsp; intentions were good, Christie said, and the song&rsquo;s historical context is important.&nbsp;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The benefit is that it&rsquo;s part of history, it&rsquo;s part of kids knowing that at one time things were separate in this country and they&rsquo;re not now.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Bess Scott, LPS director of elementary education, said Lakeview teachers were trying to help students understand that struggle, which is admirable.<br/><br/>The program was the culmination of learning more about African Americans who have contributed to society, culture and the strength of the nation, she said.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We do that every day in our curriculum,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We want our kids to see themselves and how we work together.&rdquo;<br/><br/><em>Reach Margaret Reist at 473-7226 or </em><a href="mailto:mreist@journalstar.com"><em>mreist@journalstar.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Most kids will understand the context after it has been explained to them. It's not a big deal. The only &quot;issue&quot; I have is having people stand while this song is sung. What SHOULD have happened is that people should have been sitting and the music teacher should have explained the context (historically it IS accurately referred to as the African American national anthem by some) and then it should have been sung.<br/><br/>Standing is the issue. It is standard etiquette to stand during the national anthem. In fact, I would say it is good etiquette to stand during any country's national anthem (e.g. at the olympics, at an international sporting event). It is just a sign of respect for our friends in other countries.<br/><br/>This song is not a true national anthem and therefore the rules of etiquette do not apply to it in the same manner. However, kids should know the song, the history of the song and it's importance in the African American community. The words of the song are stirring and knowing them has value for all kids. It is about respect and understanding. &quot;</div><br/></span>

That being said, so far, as far as I know, our country has only one recognized national anthem.  There are honored songs from our history that are revered, and should be: &quot;My Country Tis of Thee&quot;, &quot;God Bless America&quot;, &quot;Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing&quot;, etc.  We should teach them ALL to our children, but not as the sanctioned National Anthem for a subset of the population.  We are all Americans.  We have a terrible and painful history of racism and segregation that we must acknowledge and teach.  But to teach children that there is another national anthem for African Americans smacks of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; flavor of racist ideology that dominated the last century.  Let's not go back there. &quot;</div><br/></span>

School segregation is at it's highest at any point since Brown v. Board of Education.  Discriminatory housing and lending practices have had and continue to have a great impact on urban neighborhoods, encouraging the separation of cities into ghettos like North Omaha or T-town and the Near South in Lincoln.  Let's discuss the substantive aspects causing segregation in our society before launching into crusades against great songs in our public schools.<br/><br/>The song's revival came out of the civil rights movement Mr Roberts wraps himself up in.  Dr. King would have and probably did enjoy the black national anthem as he supported other encouragements of black pride.  We can deduce this historically from the opinions of other civil rights movement leaders he was involved with, for example Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond.<br/><br/>The fact that so many people are commenting supportive of Mr. Roberts is embarrassing and utterly indefensible.  It makes me ashamed to call this state home.  You know nothing about the song, its history, the history of the black freedom movement, Dr. King, or common sense.  Your outrage is transparently facetious. &quot;</div><br/></span>

Its principal, James Weldon Johnson, wrote the words to introduce its honored guest Booker T. Washington.<br/><br/>The poem was later set to music by Mr. Johnson's brother, John, in 1905. Singing this song quickly became a way for African Americans to demonstrate their patriotism and hope for the future. In calling for earth and heaven to &quot;ring with the harmonies of Liberty,&quot; they could speak out subtly against racism and Jim Crow laws—and especially the huge number of lynchings accompanying the rise of the Ku Klux Klan at the turn of the century. In 1919, the NAACP adopted the song as &quot;The Negro National Anthem.&quot; By the 1920s, copies of &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; could be found in black churches across the country, often pasted into the hymnals.<br/><br/>In 1939, Augusta Savage received a commission from the World's Fair and created a 16 foot tall plaster sculpture called Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing. Savage did not have any funds for a bronze cast, or even to move and store it, and it was destroyed by bulldozers at the close of the fair.[1]<br/><br/>During and after the American Civil Rights Movement, the song experienced a rebirth, and by the 1970s was often sung immediately after &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; at public events and performances across the United States where the event had a significant African-American population.[citation needed]<br/><br/>In Maya Angelou's 1969 autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the song is sung by the audience and students at Maya's eighth grade graduation, after a white school official dashes the educational aspirations of her class.[2]<br/><br/>In 1990, singer Melba Moore released a modern rendition of the song, which she recorded along with others including R&amp;B artists Anita Baker, Stephanie Mills, Dionne Warwick, Bobby Brown, Stevie Wonder, Jeffrey Osborne, and Howard Hewett; and gospel artists BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans, Take 6, and The Clark Sisters. Partly because of the success of this recording, &quot;Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing&quot; was entered into the Congressional Record by Del. Walter Fauntroy (D-DC),[3] as the official African American National Hymn. &quot;</div><br/></span>

It was written at a time in history when America was lily-white, and hence does not reflect  the multicultural reality of the present. All minorities that have suffered for so long under the white-only culture deserve, and most certainly should have, their own versions of a national anthem. Not only African Americans, but Native Americans, Latinos, Asians, Muslims, and other disenfranchised and neglected groups should have their traditions, music, culture, etc., recognized and applauded in the public schools.

We in our family honor our National Anthem (love it when the trumpets hit that high F, although other songs' lyrics would fit our country's aims and prides better).  When we've been at international concerts, we stand for the band's playing of its own national anthem, and their citizens stand for ours, also.  It's a matter of respect and consideration.  When my young grandson attended a performance of Native American drumming and singing, he stood without question for the Lakota National Anthem (was the only white member of the audience to do so) and was praised for his manners and respect by the Lakota chief on stage.  It's interesting to study the melodies and lyrics of each country's national anthem, so see what each stands for.  For instance, Germany's national anthem is known as a hymn &quot;Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God.&quot;  Interesting subject for a term paper, I found, and nothing to criticize others about.  It's just like the pledge - the same people pledge allegiance to the flag, and perhaps to the Boy Scouts, 4-H, etc., and it's all good. &quot;</div><br/></span>

Look how this song has evolved, from its roots of being the only national anthem some kids were allowed to sing, to today being an appreciated part of our American sacred music.  And for those of you who think sacred music isn't allowed in the public schools, attend one of the district high school music contests that abound in April in Nebraska, and you'll hear bands performing sacred music, soloists and choirs singing it, all over.  If you can't do that, ask your local public school music department for copies of past performances' programs, listing selections performed.  You're in for a surprise.  I know because I've accompanied high school music selections for years, and have a son who is a public school music teacher. &quot;</div><br/></span>

If Black Americans contributions to our country were recognized in history texts there would be no need for the special month. To compensate for that lack of textual material that should be taught year round Black history is crammed into one month. <br/>I would venture to say that most White Americans know little if any Black history makers. When all Americans can recall the following history items we will no longer need a Black History month. <br/>Who was the first man to set foot on the North Pole?<br/>Matthew Henson - a black man<br/><br/>Who was the founder of blood plasma and the director of the Red Cross blood bank?<br/>Dr. Charles Drew - a black man<br/><br/>Who invented the world's first stop light and the gas mask?<br/>Garrett Morgan - a black man<br/><br/>Who was the man who helped design the nation's capitol, made the first clock to give time in America and wrote the first almanac?<br/>Benjamin Banneker - a black man<br/><br/>Who was the founder of the city of Chicago in 1772?<br/>Jean Baptiste - a black man<br/><br/>Who was the woman who led countless slaves to freedom on the underground rairoad?<br/>Harriet Tubman - a black woman (I'll give credit because most white Americans know that..maybe)<br/><br/>The list can go on and on... &quot;</div><br/></span>

Have you ever attended a NHL hockey game? Yes you have to stand for both the US and Canadian anthems. What about attending baseball game in Mexico? Yes you will hear/stand for both Mexican and US anthems. It is sad that the neighbors on our international borders understand inclusion of others but we have people mentally stuck on one anthem and miss the opportunity learn more through inclusion of other cultures.<br/><br/>I see a lot of fear and misunderstanding based on the denial of reality. We have St. Pat's day and celebrations in schools and nobody is upset. We have Halloween and celebrations and I still see nobody upset. What about Easter, which is pagan originated event? The last US census shows the ethnic make up of the US changing to the point that the white majority will soon be the minority based off current population and birth rates. So at what point are you going to expose a kid to the fundamental need to knowing about other cultures as a reference point of respect and communication? This path of &quot;only one&quot; has negative historical data points from Nazis to the Talibaum today. We need to know more about others to exist and grow in peace. Canadian and Mexican nationals understand that point at what point will some of you understand peace comes though understanding and inclusion (by exposure to other cultures)? &quot;</div><br/></span>

Did you know that there is one way to view the signing of the Decloration of Independence? Look at a Canadian or British text book...I suggest that everyone needs to read Lowan's &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me.&quot; Not only will you get a history lesson, you will be more inclined to look at history and how we celebrate and learn about it today in an entirely DIFFERENT view. &quot;</div><br/></span>

I'm not Irish, but I'm making Shamrock throws with my children that depict the holy trinity.  Take advantage of the different opportunities we Nebraskans get to experience a comprehensive view of American history.  The civil rights movement was a significant point in American History and those of you who had a problem &quot;standing&quot; squandered your opportunity to be a part of a uniquely American experience.  Acknowledging others' experiences that built this great nation brings us closer as Americans, not further apart. I grew up in Lincoln with proud people of German decent making fun of me because I was a &quot;bohunk.&quot;  That's bigotry, just like denying the experience of black southerners who used a song to maintain their dignity in an era where they didn't have rights as full citizens. The U.S. isn't known as the land of opportunity because people stand for the National Anthem.  We are a nation apart from all others because our citizens have equal rights under law.  &quot;Lift Every Voice&quot; is a part of what makes us great today.  Imagine where we'd be if no had stood up for votes for blacks and women. I don't anyone would want to live in a nation like that. . . even white men and fat Nebraskans. &quot;</div><br/></span>

The teachers were trying to expose their students to different ideas and cultures, which is one of the main purposes of education. It sounds to me as if this parent is afraid of his kids being introduced to different ways of thinking than his own. Lakeview is a very diverse school and making all students feel included and part of the cultural makeup not only of their educational setting but also of this country is important for their well being and understanding of themselves and their classmates. That is why we have Black History month and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It's not some conspiracy as many people commenting here seem to think it is. All the coments here are tinged with simmering racism and hatred poorly covered up by &quot;concern&quot; for children. This parent is concerned for himself and his way of life, not the true education of students, which is what the teacher's are truly focused on. &quot;</div><br/></span>
