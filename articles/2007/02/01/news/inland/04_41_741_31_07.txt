			  <p>ESCONDIDO ---- A newly formed group of anti-illegal immigration protesters has begun rallying at a popular hiring site in the central part of the city with the intent of curbing the hiring of illegal immigrants and decreasing problems they say the immigrants cause.<br/><br/>Escondido resident David Cline formed the Escondido Minutemen Brigade ---- an offshoot of the San Diego Minutemen, a prominent anti-illegal immigration group ---- in December, and has since regularly gathered with supporters at a hiring site along Quince Street between Mission and Washington avenues to wave American flags, hand out fliers and answer questions from passers-by.<br/><br/>The Escondido Minutemen work in association with the San Diego Minutemen, a group that in the last year has protested at day-labor sites and promoted legislation that targets illegal immigration. However, Cline said the new group operates separately in response to problems that occur specifically in Escondido.<br/><br/>The Escondido City Council passed an ordinance last year that would have barred landlords from renting to illegal immigrants. That ordinance was later dropped, but the council reaffirmed its opposition to illegal immigration in January by approving a resolution that asks the federal government for permission to inquire into residents' immigration status and handle illegal immigration problems locally.<br/><br/>"We want to move illegals out of Escondido," said Cline, 60, adding that his group hopes to halt hiring at the Quince Street location and then move on to other sites. Once the group accomplishes that goal, he said, he hopes to help others start up Minutemen groups in their areas.<br/><br/>But for now, Cline said, Escondido is his first priority.<br/><br/>At the protest Wednesday, Cline and his wife set up their Escondido Minutemen post, including three large American flags, drawing questioning looks from some of the day laborers and angry words from several of them. "Stop illegal aliens who murder police and civilians," one sign said.<br/><br/>"We're not so much against the illegals as the people who hire them," Cline said at the rally. "We're not targeting any of them. We're targeting the people who hire them. It's illegal to hire them."<br/><br/>Though Cline, an Escondido resident of 25 years, said many people are supportive of his work, the protests have rankled some immigrants rights activists.<br/><br/>Oceanside attorney Claudia Smith, a longtime activist and director of the California Rural Legal Assistance Border Project who attended the protest Wednesday morning, said that most of the men are hired for occasional home labor, and that such hiring isn't illegal.<br/><br/>"You are not required to verify employment authorization" for casual, unscheduled day hiring, she said.<br/><br/>Still, the protests so far have been mostly peaceful, Escondido police Sgt. John Russo said after Wednesday's gathering.<br/><br/>"They (the Minutemen) call us ahead of time and overall it's been real mild," Russo said. Officers are not assigned to monitor the protests, he said, but they are made aware of the times they take place.<br/><br/>Cline, a former auto service manager who is now working to become a flight instructor, said he first became involved with the Minutemen six months ago because of what he described as a decline in the quality of life for those who live in the city.<br/><br/>"Wherever you go in Escondido, you see illegals," Cline said. "I've seen crime increase in Escondido dramatically. ... After a while, enough is enough."<br/><br/>Al Rench, a 60-year-old Escondido resident and local Minutemen member, said he sees what he describes as more illegal immigrants in his city than in other North County cities.<br/><br/>"We feel cheated, we feel we're supporting them," he said.<br/><br/>Rench said he is particularly concerned about young Latino women he sees walking around with their children, who he believes are "anchor babies," a derisive term used to describe children born to illegal immigrant parents.<br/><br/>While many that the Minutemen target are from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, the group is not racist, Cline insists. Some Minutemen members are Latino, he added.<br/><br/>"I'm not against Hispanics, it's illegals ---- they need to come over here the correct way," he said. "If they just flood (over the border), California won't be the way that we know it."<br/><br/>Cline said his concern is that continued illegal immigration will tip economic scales, forcing middle-income residents to leave the area, which would "turn it into another Tijuana."<br/><br/>"Most people won't want it, they'll leave," Cline said. "The average income will drop dramatically. ... It won't be the Southern California we know today if amnesty starts."<br/><br/>Cline said he started the Escondido group because the larger Minutemen group was growing so big that Jeff Schwilk, the Oceanside resident that leads the group, "was getting overwhelmed."<br/><br/>Schwilk, who said his group includes about 375 people countywide, said that several other cities, including Encinitas, Vista, Oceanside and San Diego, have formed subgroups under the broader San Diego Minutemen organization.<br/><br/>"They're still affiliated, they just have their own separate groups to focus on that city," Schwilk said. "They work on their own cities and can keep tabs better that way."<br/><br/>Since being handed the reins in Escondido, the group has grown and Cline is "bent on continuing" his work, he said.<br/><br/>-- Contact staff writer Sarah Wilkins at (760) 761-4414 or <a href="mailto:swilkins@nctimes.com">swilkins@nctimes.com</a>.

We're targeting the people who hire them. Please make up your mind either you want to stop the police and civilian murdering illegal aliens or you want to stop people from hiring them.  Make up you minds.  I think this group is a little disorganized if they do not even know what there own agenda is. What about this statement "Wherever you go in Escondido, you see illegals," Cline said. "I've seen crime increase in Escondido dramatically. ... After a while, enough is enough." So how do we know who is illegal? Do we determine that by the color of their skin? Do we determine that based on how many children they have? Do we determine that based on the clothes they wear? I am just confused and perhaps one of these non racist people can explain this strange phenomenon to me. I can say one thing for sure crime will increase if they continue to keep these men from working because if I were them and I was not allowed to work I would do whatever it takes to survive. How ridiculous that these people have nothing better to do than to push people into criminal activity. Oh I forgot "illegal aliens just come here to steal, rape and murder does that statement sound familiar Mr. Cline. I sorry but I am ashamed of your actions and I wish you would not taint the American Flag by flying it at your hate party. Oh frankly I do not care if some members of the mm group are Latinos your racist comments made in this article say it all.

Too often, out of either legitimate bigotry or lack of speaking ability, Minutemen make comments that characterize themselves as being opposed to anyone who's brown or exhibits latino culture. This is pitiful. Mr. Cline's comments about targeting those who hire illegals (as opposed to other Minutemen who would stoop lower and would blame even legal latino immigrants for society's woes) renews my faith that there are at least some minutemen who observe what they preach. I only hope this is really the case. </span></p>

Is it true that some illegal hiring is legal? I've never heard of this before. Yes, Sandra isn't it basic common sense to have a system in place to determine who legal and who is not? Enough is enough. If I needed a reason to join the Escondido MM group you just removed any doubt. The day will yet arrive when a system of national identification will be put in place and then maybe we can have a rational discussion. Why are you even mentioning the American flag when you obviously would rather be wiping your feet on it? Sandra, your apologist rantings are not very convincing. Yes as someone against illegal immigration, I am racist. Did you ever look around you to see the variety of nationalities and skin colors of legal citizens? The issue is and will remain LEGAL VS ILLEGAL?</span></p>

And, of course, the Minute Men would still be out in force, the Escondido City Council would still be passing unconstitutional ordinances targeting "illegal aliens", locals would still think all homeless people are "illegal aliens", the Escondido City Council would still refuse to issue permits for homeless shelters on cold winter nights, and the locals would still claim that anyone driving without a license or insurance is an "illegal alien".  And, of course, David Cline and his rabble would still hold up signs blaming murders and rapes on "illegal aliens".  And anyone with hispanic features would be viewed by the locals as not only of Mexican origin, but as "illegal aliens" and targeted as such.  The real clincher is that the NCT would still run at least one article a day about the subject baiting all the people who post hateful drivel in these forums to continue their rabid and ignorant posting campaign.  What a sorry state of affairs.  No wonder Escondido has made itself the laughing stock of San Diego County.</span></p>

No, you don't find out if people are illegal according to their skin color or how many kids they have. That's such a tired argument. You find out if they're legal by giving law enforcement the o.k to check legal status. That means if they don't have the correct papers or true legal "green cards" or work visas, then I'd bet you, they are illegal. If they are Illegal, they ought to be deported or just start rounding them up, take them to an immigration office, and get them started on the right track.  Then they won't have to resort to crime to survive. Although, many of them did resort to crime just to get here.</span></p>

Dave should get something together for the City People to write a Day Labor law like Vista has...

Now before you others start the name calling, look at the facts....
Also you havent seen racism yet, take a trip back east.... Most of this isnt based on racism, its based on safety, laws and the quality of life. But dont tell them that, it seems those who speakup are labled racists, kinda like in the 60's when poelpe defied the white only rule, they were called names and killed for trying to improve EVERYBODYS quality of life. I guess people who want to improve the quality in Escondido are unwanted by the Landlords, store owners, contractors. Seems safety is not their issue, just money and getting thier names in the paper...</span></p>

I do not see it as racist, but making it know that if you are in this country illegally, then we do not want you here. We do on the other hand welcome any legal immigrants who use the legal method and come into this country the legal way.

Stop the employers who hire the illegal immigrants, and thus remove the source that attracts so many from coming into this country illegally.

Myself, like so many others, we do not want our tax dollars supporting the illegal aliens, we also need to stop all of the free benefits that our tax dollars  pay for. We also need to change our laws to require immediate citizenship for all of these anchor babies to require that at least one of the parents be a legal citizen of the United States.</span></p>

I agree that there are some serious issues in Escondido.  It does look run down and sad.  Crime is up, graffiti is horrible.  But how can you say that all of these things are brought on by these guys trying to find work to feed their families.  I guess you haven't looked around at all of the white trash that lives in Escondido also?  Lot's of meth heads and such.

Before Mission, Washington and Midway streets were the most destroyed now Center city between Washington and Midway with a camp that I see Mexican men drinking beer, cooking under the palm tree and sleeping under card board. It's spreading and getting worse. Drive down Midway before Washington and there are seriously chickens in the road at times. Now we have a CaliMax 
(ValleyMax)Grocery store like this city needs another Mexican store. I forgot all the Legal Americans are getting fed up and are leaving and what a shame.
What is it with Mexican Men drinking beer in the front yard? Mexican Women pushing grocery carts with 4 or 5 kids in tow and they don't speak english. For all the people who say they are hard working, well then become Legal and there won't be anything for them to worry about. Could you imagine if the Escondido Police department posted a monthly report on all the illegal people that come through the Safety checkpoints, we would be astonished!
Here's a way to determine citizenship, "Passports" We Americans must carry them while in foriegn countries and when stopped we must provide them. Simple, easy! 
I see that crime has incresed temendously, many people would probably be extemely upset if the police would post this also but all this would be too much for so many to handle and people would not want to come here and so many would leave faster. 
To hear so very many peole who use the "Racist" word everytime they don't like to hear someone complain about the "Illegal Mexican", wrong is wrong, illegal is illegal!
I do hope this city gets help from the federal government on this issue so we can pass and enforce our hopefully new city ordinance someday.
But till then "GO Mr. Cline"!!!!</span></p>

The children of these unknown, unvetted, foreign invaders, are currently STILL recognized as citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The provision penned by our founding fathers, declaring birthright citizenship (the original, more PC words) rights as a way to guarantee the hard-earned American citizenship of freed slaves and their families, was a righteous and much-needed one at the time of the transition of the African American population from servitude to so-called "freedom."  God knows it is taking a long time for folks to "get" the meaning behind unbiased EQUALITY, for those who were so grossly mistreated during that era, but I think they are all pretty much assured of their places as citizens of the country by now!  Birthright citizenship has no useful purpose now.  Not one of our Congressional Representatives have yet been successful in removing this useless, antiquated provision from the Constitution.  The funny thing is, not one law-maker opposed to the premise of striking birthright citizenship privileges has stood before the American people to explain the "need" for it.  I find the term, "anchor baby" quite descriptive, and not at all derisive, providing you have a grasp of the original purpose behind it!  As a matter of fact, I am pretty sick and tired of the PC whiners constantly whimpering their support of those who would illegally enter this sovereign nation.  We all know the devastating effects of this invasion.  Let's call it like it is!  Let's change the old 
expression, "Anchors aweigh" to something like, "Anchors away...FAR away!"</span></p>

People who are not criminals, drug addicts,drug dealers, diseased, or of poor moral character, and people who have skills we need who will not be a burden to society. We want people of all colors, races, who want to be Americans by learning our language, customs,culture, values, laws and goverment.  An illegal has already broken our laws by sneaking into our country, and does not belong here. Without laws, and immigration laws, this would not be America as we know it. And, a country that can not defend its borders will not remain a country. The language, culture, and character of the country is because it has borders. Borders make a German a German and an Italian an Italian.  We are Ameicans and want to keep it that way. Come to America legally because you want our, heritage, language, culure, work ethic, vales and most of all to be an proud American citizen.</span></p>

It's counter-productive and completely misguided because they are not a "race," but an "ethnicity."  Sorry to burst the race-baiting bubble!

The racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register Notice entitled "Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity" issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The five minimum race categories are:

American Indian or Alaska Native. "A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment." 
Asian. "A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam." 
Black or African American. "A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as 'Haitian' or 'Negro' can be used in addition to 'Black or African American.'" 
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. "A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands." 
White. "A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa." 
An additional category, described as an "ethnicity" rather than a "race" is:

Hispanic or Latino. "A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, 'Spanish origin,' can be used in addition to 'Hispanic or Latino.'" </span></p>

The problem with the people who are on the side of the minutemen is that they are the true silent majority. They are the ones who will not take the chance of loosing their jobs or tarnishing their images, attending protests, or engaging in anything that may result in conflict. They are the law abiding citizen's who occasionally speed down the freeway or smoke where their not suppose bu will not not engage in activities that would or could result in  physical violence.

When you say "we," I assume you are referring to "Mexicanos."  If so, you are correct, Mexicans were running the show for a short time following the Spanish, but before losing a war and much of their territory to the United States.  And what has the U.S. done with "Alta" California?  Much more than Mexico has done with Baja California.  That's the real issue: Mexico has spawned a culture of corruption and chicanery, which is why they don't even have universal plumbing and sewage treatment.  If you are lucky enough to live in the U.S., whether or not you're a legal resident or citizen, you should be very grateful that you are not living in a corrupt, third world nation run by drug cartels and criminals.  This is why people continue to stream across the border - to escape a failed nation and the horrible quality of life that goes with it.  If Mexicanos want to live in an Alta California that's similar to Mexico, they need to: (1) move to Mexico, or (2) bring it on - reclaim the lost territory by proclaiming war against the United States.  You can ally yourselves with North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela.  I'm sure Hugo Chavez is a hero to many of you who are feeling oppressed.</span></p>

Mongol supposedly is a native name which comes from mong meaning "brave."

Mexico is diverse ethically.  The European population is cucasian but the native population is not.  The mixed population which is estimated at 95% - often called mestizo - is a mixture of Caucasian, African (from slaves who were brought to Mexico) and indigenous people - "Indians" who are thought to be Mongols who came over on the land bridge from Asia.

Back to school Rev Ike.  

The problem is probably not strictly racism - it is that a lot of people just don't like people who look or act differently.  Mexicans have different cultural values that many do not understand or like. Mexicans are different physcially from the mixture of races.  We locked up the Japanese during WWII but not the Germans or Italians - wonder why :)!

Racism is alive and well in this country - it's just that everyone claism that THEY are not - it's always the other guy.</span></p>

Because of �political correctness� illegal aliens are hiding behind the fact that we cannot just assume or walk up to them and inquire.  They�re accustomed to not being challenged because the rest of us citizens aren�t challenged.  Illegal aliens should not be here for a multitude of reasons, and it�s not because of race or ethnicity.  Granted, some are here to work, but in so doing they�re enjoying the benefits and freedoms of US citizenship without the responsibility.  Most work �under the table� without paying taxes, which means they�re enjoying the use of our roads, infrastructure, police and military protection, social and medical programs, without contributing one dime.  So, in order to stem the flow of illegal immigration, we need to create an environment that is inhospitable to illegal aliens.  To begin with, it should be unlawful to solicit work, and it should be just as unlawful to pick them up for ad hoc employment.  Having hiring halls for illegal aliens is only exacerbating the situation.  As long as there are jobs, or willing �employers� the illegal aliens will come.  As long as there are free-bees the free loaders (illegal aliens) will come.  As long as there is free education, welfare, and healthcare illegal aliens will come.  We need the Minute Men to bring awareness to the problem of illegal immigration and the problems illegal aliens bring with them.</span></p>

In central Escondido, the generally north-south streets are named after trees and plants!  The naming system starts with Ash, Birch, Cedar, etc.  Surrounding Quince is OPQRSTUV for Orange, Pine, Quince, Redwood, Spruce, Tulip, Upas &amp; Vine.  There are two exceptions: Escondido Blvd and Broadway.  Broadway used to be called Lime Street.  You can see Lime St. imprinted in the concrete at street corners south of downtown Escondido.  Escondido Blvd used to be called Nutmeg Street.  The generally east-west streets (avenues) used to be named after states or presidents (except Grand--it was always Grand Avenue).  Later, the names of the streets south of Grand were to changed to numbers, but Pennsylvania and part of Ohio (now West-East Valley Parkway) still remain.  Grant Avenue was named after President Grant, but the legacy of this great president and general fell to Mission Ave.  The Legacies of Washington and Lincoln still survive (but seeing was happened to Grant, who knows). The City of Escondido was founded, and the streets named, by Americans decades after America won the Mexican-American war and took possession of California.  Saying that Quince is evidence of an early Spanish or Mexican heritage in Escondido is an ignorant fable.</span></p>

I read your article, "Escondido man forms city's Minutemen Brigade". Good news!

Have you or anyone you know written about the rights of legal Escondido citizens, like me? 
If I were to join the Minutemen and if I were to confront an illegal immigrant, what are my rights and responsibilities? 
May I legally make a 'citizens arrest' and expect the police or immigration authorities to take some reasonable action? What would that action be?

How must I deal with those citizens who accompany the illegal? Is there some type of 'aiding and abetting' law that can be applied and enforced against those who employ, house, or otherwise facilitate illegal?

What do the Chief of police and City Attorney have to say about these questions?What is their official position concerning the Minutemen?
What are their private positions?

I hope you dig into this topic and write more.

Regards,
Harry </span></p>
