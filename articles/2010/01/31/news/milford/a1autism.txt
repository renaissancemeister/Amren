                            <p>Amity Regional School District officials say it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense: Why is the district being punished for having too many white autistic kids?<br/><br/>And it&rsquo;s the federal government&rsquo;s punishment that is raising tempers &mdash; cutting the crucial funding used to educate the autistic students.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a thorny issue for all sides. When one racial group &mdash; black, white or otherwise &mdash; appears to be getting a disproportionate amount of special education funding, red flags go up at the federal Department of Education. But local educators said they are powerless to control the racial makeup of their community and who is diagnosed with autism, which is under the special education umbrella.<br/><br/>Autism rates are skyrocketing, with the latest studies showing 1 in every 110 children on the autism spectrum. Properly educating autistic children is extremely expensive, and local districts rely on federal funding to offset the cost to taxpayers. The issue also hints at a hidden trend: Parents of autistic children may be moving to certain communities because the public school district has a good reputation for educating autistic children.<br/><br/>Amity Superintendent of Schools John Brady said he is frustrated and shocked. His dilemma began last year when the district &mdash; which serves Bethany, Orange and Woodbridge &mdash; received a letter from the state Department of Education. The state told Amity it has too many white students who are diagnosed as autistic when compared to other racial subgroups. Amity last year had 38 white autistic students, one Asian and one black.<br/><br/>Amity and Vernon are the only two school systems in the state and among only a handful nationwide to have a &ldquo;significant disproportionate&rdquo; amount of white autistic students, state officials said.<br/><br/>Such a classification requires the district to divert 15 percent of its Individual with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, federal funds, or $67,000 in Amity&rsquo;s case this year, toward programs designed to reduce those numbers.<br/><br/>Thirteen other districts in the state, including Derby, Hamden, North Haven and Orange, have high numbers of autistic students but are not yet threatened with an order to divert funds.<br/><br/>If the number of white autistic students at Amity does not decline, the district may face the further loss of federal funds, which would have to be absorbed by taxpayers, Brady said. The amount of the loss is not yet known and Brady said there is nothing Amity can do to change the numbers.<br/><br/>&ldquo;In difficult economic times, to be threatened with the loss of money ... it will have an immediate impact on the operations budget facing Amity,&rdquo; Brady said.   <span class="continue"><a href="?viewmode=2">Continued...</a></span></p>

												<div id="paragraphs2"><p>BUREAUCRACY<br/><br/>Mary Kuseler, assistant director for the Washington-based American Association of School Administrators, said Amity finds itself in this delicate situation because of the 2004 federal IDEA law.<br/><br/>The origins of the law date back to 1975; it guarantees a free and appropriate education for people with disabilities. But over the years, officials started to notice increasing numbers of referrals for black males into special education.<br/><br/>The feds wanted to ensure students were not over identified as being in need of special education. There was a concern that some teachers, especially in impoverished districts, would identify students with behavioral issues as special education.<br/><br/>Kuseler said this meant many black males were taken out of a regular education classroom, when in fact they had no academic issues warranting special education classes.<br/><br/>Kuseler said lawmakers wanted to ensure students were not typecast and denied a regular education.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It became a civil rights issue,&rdquo; Kuseler said. &ldquo;It was a well-intended rule, (to impose limits on numbers of autistic students in any district) but Amity has been caught by a rule that (it) was never meant to be caught by. It&rsquo;s putting those districts in a tight position where they face the loss of money in a tough economy.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Amity district has two middle schools and a high school. Autism is usually diagnosed early in a child&rsquo;s life, long before middle and high school.<br/><br/>Brady said Amity has a 90 percent white student population so it makes sense a majority of their students with autism would be white.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The state doesn&rsquo;t look at extenuating circumstances,&rdquo; Brady said. &ldquo;We were put on notice, but (we) told them this cannot be solved. Someone wants us to magically reduce the number of Caucasians at Amity with autism. We can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;   <span class="continue"><a href="?viewmode=3">Continued...</a></span></p>

												<div id="paragraphs3"><p>Brady has filed an appeal, and has been lobbying U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3, and the American Association of School Administrators to change the 2004 federal IDEA law. DeLauro said she is trying to convince the U.S. Department of Education to exempt Amity from the law, and plans to work on a legislative fix.<br/><br/>&ldquo;These are the kids that need our help. Amity should not be restricted in the way it uses IDEA funds &mdash; especially if it is using the resources where they are most needed,&rdquo; DeLauro said.<br/><br/>Amity and Vernon are part of a very select group, as officials have only been able to identify a handful of communities in Tennessee that have the same problem. However, officials said it&rsquo;s possible communities in other states are also affected.<br/><br/>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing Dr. Brady can do,&rdquo; said Kuseler. &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s nervous. I hear from him often. Here is an educator pulling out all the stops he can to protect his district.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We have to figure out a way these districts are not caught in the rules,&rdquo; Kuseler said. &ldquo;We want to come up with new legislation to solve these problems.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Officials from other districts with high numbers of autistic students said they empathize with Amity&rsquo;s plight, but also said there is nothing they can do to reverse the numbers, since autistic students must be educated.<br/><br/>North Haven Superintendent of Schools Sara-Jane R. Querfeld said doctors determine whether a child is autistic, so it&rsquo;s out of a school district&rsquo;s control.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re addressing what we can. It&rsquo;s a difficult thing. It&rsquo;s not under a district&rsquo;s control,&rdquo; she said.<br/><br/>Orange Superintendent of Schools Timothy James said he agrees the federal &ldquo;policy puts school districts in a position about which we have no control.&rdquo; In addition, districts that exceed numbers under the policy must create a remediation plan to address the issue, he said.<br/><br/>In Hamden, 89 students are diagnosed as autistic and a significant number were diagnosed prior to the age of 3, according to William McGraw, director of pupil personnel services.   <span class="continue"><a href="?viewmode=4">Continued...</a></span></p>

												<div id="paragraphs4"><p>Hamden gets about $1.4 million in IDEA money and if Hamden&rsquo;s numbers were to become further imbalanced, the state would mandate that it also divert 15 percent of the money to remediating the problem, McGraw said. The problem with that, he said, is that all of the money is used for mandated special education needs as well as for student support centers, tutorial support and suspension alternatives.<br/><br/>INSIDE THE numbers<br/><br/>State Department of Education Bureau Chief of Special Education Anne Louise Thompson said she understands this issue may lead to an outcry. The state administers the federal IDEA law.<br/><br/>Thompson said Amity is identifying more white students as autistic than would be expected for the demographics of the entire district.<br/><br/>She said even though Amity has a predominantly white student population, the disability category of autism is at a higher rate than would be expected compared to all students with disabilities.<br/><br/>Thompson said &ldquo;...it is possible that families move to a district based on its reputation for providing services.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Thompson also questioned whether Amity has ensured that all its students identified as autistic have been properly diagnosed.<br/><br/>Thompson disputed Brady&rsquo;s claim the district may lose IDEA funds next year, but said some of those dollars could be redirected again.<br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a federally legislated mandate that states redirect 15 percent of a district&rsquo;s IDEA funds in the event that the district has significant disproportionate representation of students by race and disability, which Amity did for white autistic population,&rdquo; Thompson said.<br/><br/>DeLauro said a provision in the 2004 law is having the unintended consequence of restricting the way schools serve children with disabilities. Because Amity serves a high percentage of white autistic students, the school is being required to put 15 percent of its special education funds toward other student populations, regardless of need, she said.<br/><br/>&ldquo;While I understand that the law as written was established to address situations in which too many minority students are identified as having one disability or another, and avoid what is termed a &lsquo;significant disproportionality&rsquo; for the purposes of funding, we are talking about a school district that is 90 percent Caucasian with a high incidence of autism &mdash; we can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; DeLauro said.<br/><br/>Brady said Amity could try to convince parents to change the special education classification of their child, but he opposes that concept.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We could not do that in good conscience,&rdquo; Brady said.<br/><br/>Brady said he and 15 other school district officials plan to meet with the state education commissioner to discuss the issue.<br/><br/>Amity Pupil Services Director Mary Raiola said the situation is frustrating.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be penalized for offering good services,&rdquo; Raiola said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t close our doors to students. I&rsquo;d like to see us not be penalized for something we do a good job with and something we have no control over. We want to do what is best for kids.&rdquo;<br/><br/><em>North Bureau Chief Ann DeMatteo contributed to this story.

Maybe the article was a little too long for you. The article said it was a change to the law in 2004 that is causing the problem. Let me see....who was president in 2004? Oh, yes. I remember now. A fellow named Bush. The fact is this has nothing to do with the president at all. It is a screw up by the legislature. I also don't believe people are moving into communities to get certain services. A recent California study indicated that there is a higher dx among affluent whites because they are more educated and more likely to seek medical care if they feel there is a problem. The legislature should use a formula that mimics the broader community as a whole. You will find, for the above stated reasons, that the percentage of autistic children that are white is significantly higher than those of other races. Autism exists among other races too, but they don't typically seek diagnosis.

Who knows, but the bottom line is that all children are to be treated equal and have the opportunity for an education.

Nothing is offered to support this theory other then it’s quite possible.  I know that some families need to do this. <br/><br/>Assuming this theory is more than anecdotal, such moves by parents indicate therefore other communities are not serving children as they are required by schools’ receipt and use (or illegal misuse and misdirection) of federal dollars.  <br/><br/>According to the story, “The state administers the federal IDEA law.”  Actually, the state is SUPPOSED to properly administer the federal IDEA law.  The state and Ann Louis Thompson seems to be failing at properly administering that federal law and failing to ensure that all children receive an education as required wherever they live.   <br/><br/>The law requires that children be properly served in whatever town they reside.  Parents should not have to uproot their family to find some other town that complies with the law to properly provide educational services.  <br/><br/>Clearly, that is not the case and shame on the state and Ann Louis Thompson for knowingly allowing schools to hurt kids who cannot move. <br/><br/>We need more stories that expose what really occurs in education that goes beyond mere troublesome statistics. &quot;</div><br/><div class="simpleblog-abuse"><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/shared-content/newsys/simpleblog/abuse.php?id=3537de4ed07cb3790dab5b4613f932f4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhregister.com%2Farticles%2F2010%2F01%2F31%2Fnews%2Fmilford%2Fa1autism.txt" target="_blank">Report Abuse</a></div></p>

Do some schools rely upon their own internal diagnosis done by unlicensed psychologists or even less-qualified personnel?  Yes. Such abhorrent practices are in fact the norm. These practices and those who use them are grievously harming the child who has an enforceable legal right to an independent evaluation and professional diagnosis using the DSMR criteria.  A proper diagnosis would also suggest necessary program and services. This is one reason administrators refuse a child’s access to legitimate diagnosis and evaluations, it makes their well-paid job far easier. <br/><br/>School’s who cut corners and refuse the child’s right to independent and professional evaluations is indeed a major problem leading to all sorts of problems, none of them good for the child, the district, or the state.  This administrator failure involves a conspiracy to violate federal law and harm children occurring between state and district level administrators.  The goal to perhaps save a few initial dollars at the expense down the road of a child most in need of a proper education left without receiving one ignores the resulting harm to children.  The future costs of allowing schools to get away with shortcuts to shortchange children are enormous. <br/><br/>Miss Diagnosis is correct that such abhorrent practices far to often occur.  One way a teacher has to help a child suffering under such administrative failings is to slap some label however inappropriate upon the child so at least a child in desperate need of individually designed services, might receive something else at least.  This is a crazy, unlawful, inefficient, and wasteful way to do things but money and its excessive waste is not the driving issue: administrative convenience is.  IDEA requires an INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED PLAN OF INSTRUCTION for the child.  Administrators far too often skate by with one or two plans for all children and pocket the change. <br/><br/>The funds that incompetent and abusive administrations waste in NOT providing needed services to children is astounding and sickening.  There are terrific dedicated teachers, and administrators still in the system.  Their numbers are shrinking, replaced with those ready, willing, and eager to go along with hurting children in exchange for the wonderful salaries and benefits that can be had by agreeing to hurt kids in those districts run by higher level administrators who do not see this as a problem. &quot;</div><br/><div class="simpleblog-abuse"><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/shared-content/newsys/simpleblog/abuse.php?id=e938f07966fca9022eb8f8d950b9c763&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhregister.com%2Farticles%2F2010%2F01%2F31%2Fnews%2Fmilford%2Fa1autism.txt" target="_blank">Report Abuse</a></div></p>

The nettlesome “unfunded” mandates like IDEA actually come with enormous funding which needs careful watching. <br/><br/>These formulas are in place to protect students from districts that have committed rampant fraud and misdirection of IDEA funds from children that need them.  <br/><br/>School officials seldom disclose their reprehensible activities to the public.  Parents though are well aware of districts operating fraudulently and instinctively know the only option for their child is simply to flee such districts in hope of finding safe harbor in a town that plays more by the rules.  What was a well-behaved district can literally change overnight with a change in officials, causing parents to consider repeated moves.  Many parents cannot afford these options, which is why federal monitoring is critical to keeping fraud by school officials to a level they can get away with. <br/><br/>The purpose in having such monitoring data is valid and necessary though they may not always be perfect formula especially in the instance of Amity.  <br/><br/>There does need to be better handling of anomalies like Amity. &quot;</div><br/><div class="simpleblog-abuse"><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/shared-content/newsys/simpleblog/abuse.php?id=a5e9ddfb7dbaff34ec0e80aab8dc29c9&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhregister.com%2Farticles%2F2010%2F01%2F31%2Fnews%2Fmilford%2Fa1autism.txt" target="_blank">Report Abuse</a></div></p>

Lame.<br/><br/>He made a good point. Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin are -not- white versions of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.<br/><br/>Don't even try to compare the two.<br/><br/>Jesse and Al actually go about court cases, are explicitly and unabashedly proponents of their race and their race alone, and in doing so are no doubt the the first in line for promoting change that will directly and overtly benefit Black people specifically. Thats their outspoken goal. <br/><br/>You compare them to A politician no one cares for, and tv show host? Um, no.<br/><br/>Sarah Palin has no comparable 'power' from the White community (In fact, shes generally disliked if you go by polls), neither of your comparisons are openly Pro-white, nor do either spearhead any kind of legal change for the benefit of Whites, specifically and explicitly. Like Jesse and Al, those whom you have compared them to. <br/><br/>Glenn Beck only has a loud mouth and a TV show, and thus can promote racially explicit legal change akin to the Likes of Al and Jesse? Again, no. You have very, very bad comparisons. Many holes, easy to expose. You may view them as 'Racist' figures or the like, but they do not compare on the same level to Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson for the reasons listed. What youre going to have to look for are Explicitly pro-white (That is, they make it no secret), figures that proactively go about legal change explicitly for whites. For example, trying to offset Affirmative Action through legal measures.<br/><br/>You will find none.<br/><br/>Therefore the point stands there are no white equivalents to Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. That's simply a fact.<br/><br/>Whats debatable is the NEED for such figures, for the White community. &quot;</div><br/><div class="simpleblog-abuse"><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/shared-content/newsys/simpleblog/abuse.php?id=3cd337584fa90c2bc667d896a30e1626&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhregister.com%2Farticles%2F2010%2F01%2F31%2Fnews%2Fmilford%2Fa1autism.txt" target="_blank">Report Abuse</a></div></p>

Jesse Jackson ran for President, Sharpton ran for president, senate, mayor, and whatever else, Sarah Palin was governor and ran for VP.

I believe that in the past it was pushed off as ADD or ADHD, which is a piggyback symptom of autism. I have a son with aspberger's syndrome, and he definitely has flourished with assistance through his school. The process of diagnosing autism, the frustrating doctor visits, and the expensive testing are hard won when you finally qualify for special education services at school. I think that anyone here that says it is misdiagnosed needs to realize that for years, people were put on drugs for being hyper, and that approach didn't help them one bit. We are giving truly needy children a chance to learn in a way they can understand. Autism affects many aspects of their life, not just learning. They typically have low muscle tone, speech problems, tongue thrush, and are often developmentally delayed by the time they are finally diagnosed. <br/><br/>I think that any school that would terminate the funding for a child's needs is unsensitive and foolish. This is our future. That one child that needs and receives the services they need could be the next Einstein. These children often excel in certain areas, and with proper education, they could really make a difference. The country should not see the educational costs as a burden. It is an INVESTMENT!<br/><br/>With that being said, it is not a black/white issue at hand. It is ignorance and looking to cut costs at every turn. I am surprised the government has not found a way to make insurance companies or uninsured parents foot this bill yet. Maybe they should focus on making other more expensive programs ( IE: welfare) more strict in their guidelines. Drug test all applicants. Make sure each applicant has all proper paperwork. And so on and so forth. Our children should not be punished for others abusing the generosity of our assistance programs. &quot;</div><br/><div class="simpleblog-abuse"><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/shared-content/newsys/simpleblog/abuse.php?id=3e124fdded2d8ec8ae654de7a43fc262&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhregister.com%2Farticles%2F2010%2F01%2F31%2Fnews%2Fmilford%2Fa1autism.txt" target="_blank">Report Abuse</a></div></p>
