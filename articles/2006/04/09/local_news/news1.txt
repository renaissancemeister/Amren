</div>		



<div class="story-content">&#8220;Do you recognize that truck?&#8221; asked fellow agent Bertha Alicia De la Rosa from her seat beside Montiel.<br/><br/>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s not from one of the ranches around here?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he answered as he pulled the bright orange Dodge Ram truck back on to the road and took up pursuit of the Suburban.<br/><br/>In a few minutes he was on its tail, honking his horn and flashing his lights.<br/><br/>Reluctantly, the Suburban pulled over to a stop, a quarter-mile east of the San Pedro River, a few feet south of the wire fence separating the Mexican state of Sonora from Palominas.<br/><br/>Montiel bounded from the cabin and was met on the dusty road by the driver of the vehicle, a nervous young man in his early 20s.<br/><br/>&#8220;How many do you have in there?&#8221; Montiel asked.<br/><br/>&#8220;Fourteen,&#8221; the driver answered.<br/><br/>&#8220;Do you mind if I open the back?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;<br/><br/>Montiel pulled open the hatch to reveal 14 dusty men, women, boys and girls packed together inside. The youngest members of the group appeared to be around 11 or 12. The majority looked to be teenagers.<br/><br/>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Montiel asked the group. When nobody answered, he asked again, this time more authoritatively. Montiel came to Grupo Beta from law enforcement and brought his policeman&#8217;s stern, non-nonsense demeanor with him.<br/><br/>Still no answer.<br/><br/>&#8220;You, skinny, where are you going? Phoenix? Denver?&#8221; he asked a thin, weary looking man in his mid-40s.<br/><br/>&#8220;Yeah, Phoenix,&#8221; the man replied.<br/><br/>With the ice broken, others began to chime in. &#8220;North Carolina,&#8221; &#8220;Los Angeles&#8221; and &#8220;Washington,&#8221; they said.<br/><br/>&#8220;You know it&#8217;s dangerous out there in the desert,&#8221; Montiel told the group.<br/><br/>&#8220;I want you to take a look at this,&#8221; he said as he passed out a pocket-sized brochure filled with simple, cartoon drawings offering survival tips such as, &#8220;If you get hot while walking in the daytime, don&#8217;t take off clothing or you&#8217;ll dehydrate faster&#8221; and &#8220;Rub garlic on your skin and clothing to repel biting animals.&#8221;<br/><br/>The brochure is reminiscent of the 32-page &#8220;Guide for the Mexican Migrant&#8221; comic book produced last year by the Mexican Foreign Ministry that angered some Americans &#8212; including U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz. &#8212; who saw it as a government-sanctioned effort to promote illegal migration to the United States.<br/><br/>Unlike the Foreign Ministry guide, however, the Grupo Beta booklet offers only safety tips; there is no advice on how to go undetected by immigration officials while living in the United States.<br/><br/>&#8220;And remember,&#8221; Montiel added, &#8220;although you are entering the United States illegally, you still have rights.&#8221;<br/><br/>He handed out a second, larger booklet titled &#8220;Human Rights Handbook for Migrants,&#8221; which, in addition to a crash course on basic rights, lists contact information for Mexican consulates in the Southwestern United States and hotline numbers for the 15 Grupo Beta offices throughout Mexico&#8217;s northern and southern border regions.<br/><br/>&#8220;If you get into trouble on your journey, call Grupo Beta and we can help you,&#8221; Montiel said.<br/><br/>&#8220;Take care of yourselves,&#8221; he added as he shut the hatch and headed back to his truck.<br/><br/>The agency<br/><br/>Grupo Beta is the agency within the Mexican National Immigration Institute charged with assisting migrants &#8212; both nationals and foreigners &#8212; traveling on Mexican soil. The Agua Prieta office, staffed with nine field agents and three administrators, is responsible for the border region stretching from the Sonora-Chihuahua state line to the east to the areas fronting the Huachuca Mountains to the west.<br/><br/>De la Rosa, an energetic 50-year-old grandmother who has served as coordinator for the Agua Prieta branch for the past two years, bristles when asked if Grupo Beta&#8217;s assistance efforts could be interpreted as a government-sponsored agenda to help migrants cross illegally into the United States.<br/><br/>&#8220;We give them an orientation on personal safety, we give them food and water, we advise them of the dangers of crossing the desert and we try to convince them to turn around and go home,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t tell them anything about how to cross the border.<br/><br/>&#8220;We are concerned only with trying to keep them from dying.&#8221;<br/><br/>Johnny Bernal, a spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol Tucson Sector, said his agency viewed Grupo Beta as a partner in border safety &#8212; not as an advocate for illegal migration.<br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;ve actually done a lot of cooperative training efforts with them on medical skills, GPS (Global Positioning Systems) and things like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a joint effort to try to save lives out there.&#8221;<br/><br/>On the other side<br/><br/>Back on patrol, the Grupo Beta agents watched the Suburban turn around and drive off. A few minutes later, they turned their own truck around and started back in the direction of Naco.<br/><br/>Suddenly, De la Rosa noticed movement in the brush a few hundred yards ahead.<br/><br/>&#8220;Did you see that? There are people up there,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/>But by the time the truck arrived at the spot, the handful of young men was already vanishing into the scrub on the opposite side of the fence. The last member of the group had picked a branch from a bush and was using it to sweep footprints from the dirt road on the U.S. side. He did not even pause to look up at the Grupo Beta truck.<br/><br/>&#8220;They&#8217;re on the other side now,&#8221; De la Rosa said. &#8220;They know there&#8217;s nothing we can do over there.&#8221;<br/><br/>Even on the Mexican side, there&#8217;s little Grupo Beta can do to deter migrants. Since the Mexican Constitution grants citizens freedom of movement within national territory, migrants violate no law until they enter the United States.<br/><br/>Critics in the United States have accused Mexico of using the law as an excuse for not stopping the tide of migration, and while the government of President Vicente Fox has responded to the complaints with overtures such as a new immigration policy that calls for creation of economic and housing programs to keep citizens at home, without a change in Mexican law, all Grupo Beta can do is try to talk the migrants out of their plans.<br/><br/>It can be a difficult task.<br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of these people have traveled a long way already. They have sold everything they had to pay for the journey, or their children or spouses are already in the United States,&#8221; De la Rosa said. &#8220;So they don&#8217;t even listen to us. They&#8217;re looking around, their minds somewhere else, while we talk.&#8221;<br/><br/>Watching the migrants vanish into the Arizona desert, De la Rosa was reminded of another time she was left powerless by the fence that separates Mexico and the United States.<br/><br/>A little over a year ago, the Grupo Beta office in Agua Prieta received a distress call from a teenage boy who said his 42-year-old aunt was in trouble in the desert. She had been trying to cross the border to join her children in Pennsylvania after fleeing from an abusive husband at home. Her two nephews had tried to talk her out of the journey, but she was insistent. Concerned for her safety, the two teenagers decided to accompany her on the trip.<br/><br/>The three family members had been walking through the desert east of Agua Prieta with a pollero, or migrant smuggler, when the woman complained that she didn&#8217;t feel well. The pollero told the boys to leave her behind and continue on, but they refused. One stayed with the woman while the other went for help.<br/><br/>When the Grupo Beta agents followed the teen, they found that the woman had crossed into U.S. territory, and so they had to call the Border Patrol to respond. The wait seemed like an eternity to De la Rosa.<br/><br/>&#8220;We were just 15 minutes away from her, but we couldn&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/>Border Patrol agents eventually evacuated the woman, unconscious, to a hospital in Sierra Vista, but she could not be revived. Her children took her body to Pennsylvania for burial.<br/><br/>&#8220;In one sense, I guess, she succeeded in getting to Pennsylvania,&#8221; De la Rosa said.<br/><br/>&#8220;That was just about my worst experience on the job.&#8221;<br/><br/>Crossing paths<br/><br/>The Grupo Beta truck was now a mile or so past the spot where the last group of migrants had been seen crossing. Suddenly, on the other side of the fence, a Border Patrol truck raced past in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>&#8220;They saw them,&#8221; De la Rosa said matter-of-factly.<br/><br/>Grupo Beta does not alert the Border Patrol to crossers &#8212; it would destroy their credibility with migrants, they said. According to De la Rosa, it&#8217;s hard enough already to get migrants to stop and talk with them.<br/><br/>&#8220;When they see us, they often try to run,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;They know the Border Patrol can see us and our orange truck and jackets, so they worry that they will be seen, too.&#8221;<br/><br/>De la Rosa has little contact with Border Patrol agents other than exchanging greetings across the border fence.<br/><br/>&#8220;I don&#8217;t speak English,&#8221; she explained.<br/><br/>Earlier that morning when the truck pulled up across from two Border Patrol vehicles whose drivers had stopped to chat, De la Rosa decided to take advantage of the English-speaking reporter who was riding along that day.<br/><br/>&#8220;Ask them if they&#8217;ve seen any Minutemen,&#8221; said De la Rosa as the truck rolled to a stop.<br/><br/>The Border Patrol agents said no, they hadn&#8217;t seen any of the civilian volunteer border watchers.<br/><br/>&#8220;From what I&#8217;ve read in the paper, they&#8217;re staying farther west this year,&#8221; one agent said amiably.<br/><br/>The two parties exchanged goodbyes and the Grupo Beta team drove on.<br/><br/>&#8220;We really don&#8217;t know what to think of the Minutemen,&#8221; De la Rosa said.<br/><br/>&#8220;They don&#8217;t communicate with us at all, so we don&#8217;t know what their intentions are. All we know is that they carry guns, and so when they are around, we warn the migrants that they are out there.&#8221;<br/><br/>Grupo Beta agents do not carry weapons, which can put them in a precarious position at times.<br/><br/>De la Rosa said they sometimes get calls from migrants who are being robbed or assaulted by bandits or by their polleros. In those situations, they try to detain the assailants without using force.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult and it puts us at risk,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re way out here in the desert, alone with some bad individuals.&#8221;<br/><br/>Spirit of service<br/><br/>Back in Naco, Sonora, De la Rosa jumped from the Grupo Beta truck, handed off her bright orange windbreaker to a fellow agent, said goodbye to Montiel and climbed into her own car. She was suffering a head cold and was eager to get out of the desert wind.<br/><br/>On the return ride to Agua Prieta, she talked about her life experiences and how they contribute to her work at Grupo Beta.<br/><br/>Her three previous careers &#8212; public accountant, lawyer and nurse &#8212; provided her with a certain level of expertise in managing an office, promoting civil rights and helping people in trouble, she said. And as a mother and grandmother, she knows how to provide service to others.<br/><br/>Her family members, knowing the dangers of the job, worry about her at times. But De la Rosa said she is empowered, not intimidated, by her work.<br/><br/>&#8220;The spirit of service is something you always have,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And when you have the spirit of helping, you don&#8217;t think about death.&#8221;<br/><br/>HERALD/REVIEW reporter Jonathan Clark can be reached at 515-4693 or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:jonathan.clark@bisbeereview.net">jonathan.clark@bisbeereview.net</a>.</div>

Intereting how they have no problem writing up statements for children to read and then have to lead the children through it, all the while holding the pretense that the statements are the children's own. If the Ronald person is a citizen and Navy vet he should know better than to behave this way.... If he wants to hunt on private property he should ask permission.

Guilty until proven innocent in the Tucson sector.  The truth is no one really knows what happened out there except for the ones that were there.  This town has already crucified a man without knowing the story.  I wish these people could put themselves in an agents place before pacing judgment.  Never knowing who will attack you or when.  Always fearing for your life.  Not to mention the spouses fear of never seeing a loved one again.  I hale from Bisbee, AZ and am currently in Iraq serving our country.  When I showed this article to soldiers from other parts of the country they were as disgusted as I.  Let the man have a fair trial.  This won’t happen in Bisbee.   &quot;</div><br/></p>
