			  <p>ESCONDIDO -- Escondido became the first California city to ban renting property to illegal immigrants on Wednesday, bringing to a head months of divisive arguments in the community, and possibly setting the city up for a protracted legal battle. <br><a href="http://www.nctimes.com/movie/eprotest/viewer.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.townnews.com/nctimes.com/art/video.gif" border="0"> View A Video</a> -<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/10/05/special_reports/eprotest/" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.townnews.com/nctimes.com/art/camera.jpg" border="0"> View A Slide Show</a><br/><br/><a href="http://escondido.12milesout.com/Escondido/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Streamed Council Meetings</a><br/><br/>At the end of a contentious, late-night meeting, the measure passed by a margin of 3-2, with Council members Ed Gallo, Sam Abed and Marie Waldron ---- who proposed the ban ---- in support. Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilman Ron Newman voted against it.<br/><br/>Despite hearing two hours of often-emotional public testimony pleading both sides of the issue, the outcome of the vote was never in question, as Gallo, Waldron and Abed had regularly made public comments in support of the law.<br/><br/>Waldron argued that the ordinance was needed to counter what she called a lack of initiative to address illegal immigration at the federal level, and that the country's sovereignty was under attack by a wave of illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>"If there was ever a time more important to stand up for our sovereignty, our nation and community, this is it," Waldron said.<br/><br/>In passing the ban, Escondido became the sixth city in the country to adopt local legislation penalizing landlords who rent to illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>The ordinance must come back to the council on Oct. 18 for a second vote before it can be enacted 30 days later.<br/><br/>Several civil rights groups have already promised to challenge the ban in court, something that could delay its enactment.<br/><br/>The law was proposed as a way of addressing residential overcrowding in the city. And in explaining the motives behind their votes, the council majority often referred to a city-commissioned study of the Mission Park neighborhood downtown. That study found that roughly 80 percent of the 16,000 residents in the area were foreign-born, mostly from Mexico, and often lived in overcrowded conditions.<br/><br/>"Illegals are willing to live in horrible conditions," Gallo said, citing problems with health and safety of overcrowded units. "This leads to a lot of other issues."<br/><br/>Newman and Pfeiler said they recognized immigration was a popular issue, resulting from mounting frustration with federal enforcement. But they said the ordinance would do little to actually resolve those issues, since it is based on federal verification of documents.<br/><br/>"We're telling you we're going to do something, and in reality, we're not," Newman said.<br/><br/>He also said Waldron's attempt to address immigration at the local level was simply based on discrimination.<br/><br/>"To suggest that this ordinance is something other than going after Latinos and Mexicans in our community is really false," Newman said. "That's clearly what it's about."<br/><br/>The controversial proposal drew crowds that filled council chambers and overflowed into the courtyard in front of City Hall, where TVs broadcasting the meeting were set up.<br/><br/>Demonstrators from both sides spent the hours before the meeting rallying outside, chanting slogans in support or in opposition to the law.<br/><br/>To handle the crowds, dozens of officers patrolled the civic center area, including representatives from at least a half-dozen other county law enforcement agencies. And only individuals holding one of 200 tickets handed out before the meeting were allowed inside. Everyone who entered the building had to pass through metal detectors.<br/><br/>The council's discussion also generated a storm of media attention, with news outlets from around Southern California covering what for most weeks is a sleepy, mundane meeting.<br/><br/>Under the rental ban, the city would only take action after a complaint is filed with the city's business license division by a resident, official or business owner. Complaints would have to describe the alleged violators. However any complaint based primarily on a person's race, ethnicity or national origin would be discarded.<br/><br/>Complaints deemed valid would be investigated by the city, and landlords would be required to submit identification documents for the tenants in question. The city would verify the documents with federal immigration agencies.<br/><br/>If the renters are found to be in the country illegally, landlords would be required to remove the tenants within 10 business days, or have their business license suspended, meaning they could not legally collect rent or lease their property. Landlords who repeatedly violate the ban would face misdemeanor charges, which carry penalties of up to $1,000 and/or six months in jail.<br/><br/>Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, have promised to take the city to court to prevent the ban from taking effect. They say the law is unconstitutional and would violate federal fair housing laws.<br/><br/>Many speakers said the law was necessary to counter what they called federal inaction on illegal immigration.<br/><br/>"One by one, American cities are going to be doing the same," said Claudia Spencer. "And one by one, Americans are going to be getting their cities back."<br/><br/>That trend began earlier this summer.<br/><br/>Escondido's ordinance was modeled after a similar measure in Hazleton, Pa., which in July became the first American city to adopt its own immigration law.<br/><br/>Since then other cities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Missouri have passed their own ordinances.<br/><br/>Those who argued Wednesday in favor of the Escondido ban said that it was necessary to stem a roaring tide of illegal immigration into the region, and that it would improve the quality of life for legal residents of Escondido.<br/><br/>Those opposing the measure called it an embarrassment for the city and said it would unfairly target Latinos. They warned that the rental ban would be detrimental for Escondido's community, its businesses and its image.<br/><br/>About 42 percent of the city's 140,000 residents are Latino, according to the San Diego Association of Governments.<br/><br/>Since Waldron proposed the ban in July, the matter has generated divisions among many parts of the community. Those divisions were clear in the public comments to the council, where immigrants, landlords, business owners and local residents all argued for and against the ban.<br/><br/>Jim Brabant, an Escondido landlord, said he would be happy to comply with the ordinance. He said that immigration across the border may be chaotic, "but the effects of that chaos is felt locally in Escondido"<br/><br/>Many other landlords, however, said the council was making a grave mistake.<br/><br/>Jackie Grant, an Escondido landlord, said they would never have bought property here, if they had known the council planned to pass what she called a racially motivated attack on immigrants.<br/><br/>"We are totally embarrassed by this," said Grant, who moved here two years ago. "We don't want landlords to be a scapegoat for a problem that's way, way, way bigger than this (ordinance)."<br/><br/>Deborah Szekely, and many others in the city's business community, said the measure was certain to drive potential business investment away from Escondido.<br/><br/>"Our city will be identified worldwide as racist and our people will be seen as looking to the past instead of the future," Szekely said.<br/><br/>The council also voted 4-1 to track the effectiveness of the ordinance, including how often it results in complaints, evictions an the costs of enforcement and defending the law to any legal challenges that might result. Gallo opposed the tracking measure.<br/><br/>-- Contact staff writer David Fried at (760) 740-5416 or dfried@nctimes.com.</p>

Pheiler and Newman- you folks just put an early fork in yourselves regarding the November election by voting against this ordinance. Mayor Pfieler claims this is an issue for the federal government. Wrong! You are the governmental leader of this town and YOU have allowed these local conditions to prevail under your leadership, not George Bush's. ILLEGAL is ILLEGAL, there is nothng to  debate. This ordinance simnply enforces laws that already exist. I would start finding boxes now honorable (ex)Mayor.</span></p>

Our Federal Government.  The Federal government of the United States. The law: US Code Title 8, Chapter 12, subchapter I section 1101 &amp; subchapter II section 1325.  Immigrant: an individual who has received permission to enter and
permanently reside in the US. The written permission document issued
by the US government to the immigrant after successfully completing
required health tests, financial checks, and criminal investigations
is called a visa. Alien: an individual in the US who is not a US citizen. After entering the US, the "immigrant" becomes an alien. Illegal alien: Anyone in the US in violation of the law. The illegal alien has intentionally chosen to violate the law and lacks the evidence VISA that they have observed all US laws in entering and remaining in the country. Most illegal aliens enter via the US-Mexico border, either alone or with a smuggler. Other illegal aliens entered the US legally under a
student, tourist or other temporary visa (promising to leave at the
end of their "visit") and chose to remain after their visa expired.
When the temporary visitor chose to "overstay" their visa, they became an illegal alien. Their original "legal" entry doesn't give
them upgraded status from the more common illegal border-crosser.

If we could stop ignoring this fact and stop renaming these criminals just to �be polite�, people who are normally up standing citizens would stop endorsing this criminal behavior (assisting a known crime is still a crime).
Do we now call a bugler, an illegal house guests? A rapist: an illegal sex partners? A car thief, an illegal driver? Child Molesters: illegal sex instructors? A drug dealer a illegal pharmacists? NO! So why have we done it here? 

Maybe if we stop covering up the fact that the people in question are criminals, who entered our homes illegally, more people would get over their own racists fears (everybody has them) and solve the crime spree (yes it is a crime to enter the country illegally).  
Is'nt it a crime to have 4 families living in a apartment designes for one?</span></p>

All I get from this law is if you are an illegal alien you will not be able to rent a place to live in. Now because you are an illegal alien you came to the US to work and make money to give you and your family a better life so you won't leave that easy and most likely simply find a way to live somewhere. If you are on your own as an illegal immgrant you would probably go to city parks, dark streets, or hide somewhere just to pass the night. How would Escondido then be a cleaner city? How would this make our city a safer city? It makes no sense to me. Other lower income American citizens let's say replaced illegal immigrants and would rent where illegal immigrants rent now. Would the new American citizens that cannot afford a house and would have to rent make our city a better place to live? Wouldn't that overcrowed the city even more? Now not only would the city have illegal immigrants, but the city would have to deal with homeless illegal immigrants.</span></p>

Thanks for calling attention to the fact that the majority of Escondido does not like what is happening in this once fine city. Six cities nationwide have adopted similar ordinances. Soon many more will follow. The name calling, venomous rhetoric will start. The insults, threats to ones safety, will continue. Sad isn't it that Marie Waldron has to have body guards?  The ACLU and all the other civil rights groups can sue away. Like waving the Mexican flag, its only going to piss off the majority of Americans as you all continue to sue, spew venom, make threats. And to "had enough" I'm not sure I can sleep well just yet. This is going to get uglier and uglier. Maybe we should all get bodyguards.</span></p>

I almost hope the ACLU brings suit, then falls on their collective faces. The A in ACLU is supposed to stand for American, not illegal Mexican.</span></p>

Fifteen people are being squeezed into single family homes, the streets are totally parked up, crime is way up, and the quality of life for regular people has detoriated markedly.  Do you like trying to sleep at night while your illegal immigrant neighbors are having a party in their front yard, complete with a laser light show and a PA system?  Their kids running wild and screaming up and down the street at midnight?  

It's a disgrace and has been a disgrace for YEARS. They act like they own this city.  I was just visiting my family a few weeks ago, and every mexican that drove down the street gave me the dirtiest look, like they own everything and I was trespassing.  Well, guess what?  You don't!

It's about damn time the city did something about this, though I am almost certain that this will not hold up in the courts.  A statute concerning reasonable occupation of single family homes would have been more reasonable and would have also have prevented group home ownership, e.g. fifteen different names on one mortgage for a single-family home.</span></p>

There is a house on the corner across from mine. It is owned by hispanics. There are three rooms being rented at any one given time. These people come and go with bags (no cars). They stay for a month or so. Then there is a whole new group of renters. The cycle goes on and on.

My question: Do home owners that rent rooms in their home have to comply to this ordinance as well?

I've been behind Marie on this since Day 1.  The next step is to work on the other Citys to step up to the plate and do the same, this will drive them back home.  What a shame to see a kid flying the Mexican flag on the footsteps of the City building.  This isn't Mexico.  The illegals have done a great job of biting the hand (US)that feeds them.  Ignorant and disrespectful!!  If they are so proud of their country then they should live there and clean it up!</span></p>

How can anyone not think this is a good thing? Eventually, with the people "flocking" out of Escondido, the other municipalites will have to follow suit and after a while, they'll all be living in the hills and canyons. Then, maybe the Border Patrol will finally arrest all the illegal aliens because we all know they aren't allowed to enforce the law in the cities.</span></p>

If you read any blog about illegal immigration, the same crap is getting posted! Come up with something different! Quit feeding into the same ole topic that promotes a rift between all of us because of our opinions! Legalized hispanics, get ready for the racial profiling when you rent an apartment or jus being in Southern California at that! I got used to racial profiling when I would countinuosly get pulled over by the police because I "looked suspicious". Turns out that I am  a family man that has an office job and has never been to jail!</span></p>

It is not bias, racial, or anything else. It is just upholding the laws of this country. Thank You City Council!</span></p>
