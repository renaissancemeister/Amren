			  <p>LA CRESTA -- Fed up with what it says is a failure on the part of authorities to act on the area's illegal immigrant problem, a group purporting to be residents of the affluent, sprawling and isolated La Cresta, Tenaja and Santa Rosa communities is vowing to take matters into its own hands.<br/><br/>A group calling itself Private Police Force announced last week on a new Web site that it will begin doing the job U.S. Border Patrol and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department aren't doing by conducting citizens' arrests on illegal immigrants and detaining them.<br/><br/>If it follows through on its promise, the group would be taking things further than other anti-illegal immigration groups, such as The Minutemen Project, which have previously deployed their members to monitor the U.S.-Mexico border and only report illegal immigrant sightings.<br/><br/>The Private Police Force is threatening to actually detain illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>"They will be handcuffed to the Oak Trees," according to the group's Web site, so they can be picked up by authorities.<br/><br/>"Don't treat this website lightly," the group states. "We will make Citizens Arrests on Illegal Aliens. We will File Criminal and Civil Complaints if you Hire or House an Illegal. If you have sold a vehicle to an illegal, we will prosecute you under the DMV law too. If you house an illegal, we will also prosecute you under the Zoning Laws."<br/><br/>Wendy Lee, a San Diego-based spokeswoman for the U.S. Border Patrol, defended the job her agency has done in the area. The La Cresta-Tenaja-Santa Rosa area is handled by the agency's Murrieta station, she said, and it has done a good job of both being proactive and being responsive when individuals come to the station with tips.<br/><br/>In this case, that isn't happening, she said Tuesday.<br/><br/>"We haven't had a complaint from the community around (Murrieta) stating there is a problem there," Lee said. "We haven't had any reports that I know of. ... If they want to report it to us, we will take care of it."<br/><br/>When asked whether the Private Police Force group could legally conduct citizens' arrests, Lee said she did not have an answer. If the group is found to be violating the rights of individuals, she said, it will have to answer for that.<br/><br/>"This is a free country," Lee said. "They will have to face authorities."<br/><br/>Though it states it is prepared to identify those in the community sympathetic to illegal immigrants, the group ---- which launched its Web site through an anonymous Internet-hosting company ---- is not yet identifying any of its own members.<br/><br/>The names and photos of those who oppose the group's efforts will be posted on the Web site, www.privatepoliceforce.com, according to a statement on the site. The names and photos of known illegal-immigrant workers will also be posted, the statement says.<br/><br/>Also, arrests will be recorded on video and offered for viewing on the Web site, the group states.<br/><br/>The only information provided on the site about the group's members is that "We have three lawyers and several regular police officers who have pledged private investigation time in our area," and that the group would be hiring "a few security professionals."<br/><br/>Requests for interviews through the group's e-mail address were not returned this week.<br/><br/>According to the group's statement, "Many Mexican illegals are stealing from many residents on the Santa Rosa Plateau, including La Cresta, Tenaja and the surrounding communities." The immigrants camp in the nearby canyons and other areas and are employed by homeowners in the community, the statement says.<br/><br/>Many of them have escaped or have been released from Mexican jails and have lengthy criminal records that include child molestation, rape and murder, according to the statement.<br/><br/>Proof is not offered to support any of those claims.<br/><br/>Longtime La Cresta resident Vicki Long said Tuesday that the area has had its share of problems with illegal immigrants over the years. Though she said she is not aware what the situation is now, Long said there was a time several years ago when illegal immigrants would deal drugs and fire guns from a camp near her property.<br/><br/>The group and its Web site, she said, are an indication that it is probably still a problem.<br/><br/>"I just question why they're having to do that when we've got other agencies that should be handling the problem," Long said. "We pay our taxes for that sort of thing. I don't know why law enforcement isn't helping these people. They sound quite desperate."<br/><br/>Though the group echoes some of the things Long said about the illegal immigrant problem in the area on its Web site, it does so with much more inflammatory language.<br/><br/>In a section of the Web site ---- which appears professionally done and features photos of police officers, barbed wire and a set of hands cuffed behind someone's back ---- titled "How to Recognize an Illegal/Thief," the group offers several tips.<br/><br/>Among the things to look for, it states, are "If they carry a short garden hose, used to siphon gas from your car at night" and "If they carry their lunch in a plastic bag composed of stolen oranges and burritos."<br/><br/>-- Contact staff writer Jose Carvajal at (951) 676-4315, Ext. 2624, or <a href="mailto:jcarvajal@californian.com">jcarvajal@californian.com</a>.</p>

Although I do live in Temecula its not far from any of these locations. Not to mention I have stopped at the border patrol checkpoint twice to report massive illegals, and were they are staying. (in my complex) Once an undercover agent followed me into my complex. I did see some results for a week, but haven't seen anything in over a month. So you pro illegals know I have nothing to do with this group yet, but I side with them as I beleive the border patrol really won't take a comunity seriously untill the population is about 35% illegal. My opinion could be wrong.</span></p>

You can not tell who is illegal and who is not. On your web site you describe an illegal. Well you also described allot of homeless people. When you ask the people if they have papers are you going to hit up everyone or just the dark skinned one. If they are white are you going to let them just pass on by. There has to be a better solution to fixing this problem then what you people are doing.</span></p>

I said when Tony Blair was in LA that they were worried about the terrorist and yesdterday I said that we were at high alert with Homeland Security.  Until we shut the borders and deport ALL illegals we are at extreme danger. These terrorists that have crossed our southern borders are more intelligent than most Americans and our US government, case in point.  When our government was thinking they were slick in monitering phone communications and the public was outraged, no one considered that the terrorist were smarter than us.  They were using email assigned to the terrorist so when they came into the US illegally, through our borders all the had to do was go to your libraries, sign onto their email and get the addy of the website that the Iranians had prepared, the website contained info regarding attacks, these websites were only up for a few days, then they would be removed and the terrorist would wait for a new website with new attack info.  Very easy to gain info from their protected homeland. Until we get rid of the politically correctness that will kill us and replace with common sense, until our Government can think as the terrorist do, until your childrens and grandchildrens lives mean more to you, than the human rights of those crossing our borders illegally, and until these borders are shut down and ALL illegals deported at once, we my friends are just sitting ducks. </span></p>

Homeless? Get a grip even the homeless speak English. Our Nations language.......If the ILLEGAL ALIENS are here, then it's time to deport them? If they are stealing from state and federal funds.I say tent city for them. If they claim to be here to work, dear Lord, lets put them to work, Streets to be sweep, vacant lots to be mowed, vacant buildings to be torn down and hwys and streets in need of repair.Cancel the motor driven gas guslers, they still make hand brooms, shovels without motors, they still make push mowers. What the mower doen't get the weight of the ankle braclets will break it down. Say the streets need to be restriped? They still make hand paint brushes.These are the jobs Americans won't do, so I am all for giving them the opportunity to do it. Say sun up to sun down and a nice little tent to sleep in, who knows they might actually show a plus in the debit book if they get enough time.We are feeding a hudge part of Mexico's criminals in our prisons, throw their butts out in the hot sun and rain and let them grow food for all of them. Don't be dragging out the gas machines for this either.. Our ancestors did it by hand so can the criminals. As far as the rapist and child molesters, just leave them on the tree, the animal preditors will clean up the mess and thank you for the food. I only have one question..what does dark skin have to do with illegal?This word ILLEGAL seems to be lacking a defination in the New World Dictonary........ </span></p>

The first was the AFL/CIO protecting our rights. They won a case that made it ilegal for INS to check papers just because of race. 
The second cause was the last "comprehensive immigration reform act" It showed mexican nationals that all they had to do was get here and stay for some length of time and they would get citizinship.
The other issue is the corupt mexican society, but we can't do much about that.
We need to figure out a legal way to take the cuffs off of our immigration law enforcers. That doen't include amnesty. They also need to cut ilegals off from the public money, WIC social security and so forth. Mosdt importantly they need to bust who ever hires ilegals. Wether they do it knowingly or not.</span></p>

It's only a matter of time before they try to make a citizens arrest on the wrong LEGAL immigrant who decides to whoop their pretentious lily white butts and leave THEM chained to their Mercedes.

After seeing a number of your signs posted throughout La Cresta and environs, I took the opportunity to visit your website. I fully support the idea of total boarder enforcement. I agree totally that illegal immigrants have woefully damaged not only the economy of California, but several neighboring states along the Mexican border, with the problem moving into other states at an alarming rate. Now that I have shared my views on illegal immigration let me comment on the content of your website. The first issue I find alarm-ing is that you have omitted who you are. Why are you hiding under cover of your do-main name? Who are you? The content of your website is inflammatory and racist. The intimidation posture you have elected to adopt is surely not going to go far in winning support of you neighbors. The idea that you will �turn in your neighbors to the authorities and see them put in jail� is ludicrous at best. Yes, there are laws on the books regarding harboring of illegal aliens. If the government won�t go after and follow through with prosecution of private industry, what makes you think you can get them to go after an individual? Contrary to what you are attempting to imply, �Our Private Police Force is registered as PrivatePoliceForce.com� you are NOT a lawful police force. The only thing registered is your domain name; Registration 04-17-2002 and updated 05-08-2006 hosted out of Englewood, Colorado. I found the substance of your website to be so seditious to-wards your neighbors that I will not disclose my identity to you at this time. I am an American born citizen who has learned the hard way to fear groups who hide their iden-tity and who use fear and intimidation to get their point across. We do not need another twenty-million illegal aliens, Mexican or others in OUR country, and we don�t need an-other racist either. What I suggest to you is that you unmask who you are, drop your pos-ture of intimidation and open up public dialogue concerning your issue with purging the area of illegal aliens. We know who Jim Gilchrist of the Minuteman Project is, we know who Joseph Turner of Save Our State is, but we don�t know who you are.

Sincerely,
An Alarmed Citizen

With the terrorist issues we have to deal with our government has chosen not to help Americans, but rather put the needs &amp; wants of another country in front of Americas. Why is that? When did it become a crappy deal to be an American? How come our opwn government prefers to help NON- Americans rather than the ones who pay thier salaries? The big new number is the 1 Billion dollars we spend on illegals for social services &amp; medical care. Dont we have thousands of Americans in New Orleans that could use that 1 Billion dollars? Its sad that its come to this, our own government doesnt care about American citizens as much as lawbreakers that come here with NO respect for our laws or policies.

Eventually the first family would have saved enough to buy a duplex--and move up.  Those tenements neighborhoods were the first step in fulfilling the American dream.  Yes, they were over crowded and English wasn't the first language for most in the neighborhood, the mass was said in Portugese at the catholic church; they had ESL classes at school and the food and customs were different.

I am a resident of Santa Rosa West and Saturday morn-ing the areas of La Cresta, Tenaja and Santa Rosa West were liberally adorned with signs reading; �Hire or House an Illegal - Go to Jail� followed with the web address for this so called police force. In a matter of hours the signs all disappeared. The residents of this area are good at policing what is perceived to be litter, and that is what the signs were, litter posted by a racist group on private property. I fully support enforcing OUR borders to end ILLEGAL immigration. Let the bleeding heart open border crowd invite in, house, feed and cloth the illegals and let me have my tax dollars back to pave our roads, fund our schools and universities and fee up prison beds for the homegrown criminals we need to house. We don�t need another twenty-million ILLEGAL aliens here, nor do we need one more racist group. But as long as ICE (Border Patrol, Immigration) can�t do the job, because the Bush administration won�t allow them to do their jobs, then I have to con-sider turning a blind eye to this apparent racist vigilante group. That is a sad commentary on our society, but it�s time to stop the flow of ILLEGAL aliens. I have no problem with those who wish to immigrate here legally and assimilate into our society. Running across our sovereign border is the same as breaking into my house. Break the law, pay the price. Now I guess I can be added to the racist list because I demand that the law of our land be enforced. Whoever wrote, �ILLEGAL ALIENS NOT A RACE� I say to you, BRAVO!</span></p>

As a life long Californian, I have spent 35 years side by side with illegals.  They, as a rule, do NOT want American citizenship, they hate Americans.  Americans are fools who pay and pay so they can send money home and then retire in luxury in Mexico. All these supposed "hate groups, KKK, Nazis" etc. want is America FOR Americans. As an American I find it hard to understand what is wrong with that? You scream that the Minutemen and this proposed police force are LAWBREAKERS!!!!! Yet all they are trying to do is stop the illegal invasion which is, in and of itself breaking the law. Not to mention the myriad laws broken by people here illegally and therefore untracable. Bottom line Pro Illegal Immigrantion forces are, by definition, Anti American.  You slap your fellow Americans in the face with every Pro Illegal statement or gesture you make. Shame on you.  I, for one, am proud to be an American, and am never ashamed to think, feel, believe: AMERICA for AMERICANS. Yeah, I know, what a hate filled , racist I am. </span></p>

But people who use terms like "maggots" to describe other human beings and who visually identify and classify "illegals" because of their dark skin and mexican/indian appearance--and then attribute to all people who look like that the traits of criminality, lazy, welfare fraud, etc etc etc are RACISTS!  

You can protest all you want but the core of the anti-immigration movement is racist and it appeals to and exploits racist attitudes and beliefs.  You may not believe you're racist, but listen to what the people you hang with are saying.  It is true that illegal immigration is not a race, but grouping and classifying people based on their shared physical appearance is racism.  

Back 20-30 years ago when the largest group of illegal immigrants in the USA were Irish--we didnt hear the same vile name calling against them. </span></p>

IF America hadn't booted Mexicans out AND paid a pretty penny to the Mexican government, AZTLAN would today be just an extension of the existing Mexico, as corrupt and poverty stricken as it is today. Illegals would be crossing the Aztlan borders for the freebies of America as they do today.  The arguement is so ridiculous.  WHEN Mexico takes over Aztlan, WHAT will differentiate it from the Mexico that is already destroyed? WHO will pay the Mexicans in AZTLAN? It is the Americans who built the area Mexicans insist is theirs into the great South West it has become.  IF Mexico and Mexican-Americans who are proponents of this move achieve their dream, then the rest of America is no longer on the hook to foot your bill, right? You corrupt government will destroy it just as they have the rest of your country and you'll soon be jumping another border. Along with pro illegal groups, the pro Mecha, La Raza groups need to WAKE UP...nothing will change...it hasn't yet in your country and just by expanding it into the US, as you desire, without AMERICANS to pay for everything, it will just be more of the same.</span></p>

and trusted. As someone that has been ripped before, the police always tell you that it was somebody that was working for you. I was also guilty of occaisionaly hiring these guys, but haven't in years and never will again.  Round em' up and ship em' out. Even if this site is a hoax it raises some valid points. Talk to the cops on the hill (Santa Rosa Plateau) when they come to take a report and they'll tell you exactly the same thing. If you are older 
and retired you're even more likely to become a victim.   
There's only two cops for the whole area that stretches form the San Diego borderline west of the 15 all the way to where the Elsinore police station picks up the slack on the north end. This has  
been the preferred smugglers route for decades as there are no checkpoints like the one on the 15, which is just there as window dressing to keep you and I aware of their presence, which is a joke. How can the police take a pro-active approach to crime when they're busy taking theft reports? Better to keep them trolling the  Temecula Promenade Mall and hiding Motors (Motorcycle cops) near intersections for traffic violators than actually 
be allowed to fight real crime. It's time for a real guest worker program that includes laws with teeth and penalties that include never being able to work or come here again, ever, if convicted of ANY crime other than an infraction. Why not have guest worker centers that you pay a daily fee directly to them per worker, not unlike legal temporary job services provide? It's also way overdue for the Southwest Riverside Police Department 
to employ more officers on the west side of the freeway and for the 
local Border Patrol office to grow some testicles and do some high profile, local investigations and arrests.  The large nurseries and agricultural growers in Rainbow, Fallbrook, Oceanside and Vista are some of the biggest offenders and they're aware, but choose to do nothing (oops, off topic!) There 
 wouldn't be a place for these vigilante groups if our own tax dollars were being spent where they belong. This place isn't anything like it was 30 years ago, 
 I know not many places are. I'm thinking half of the year in coastal NorCal and the other half at Lake Havasu. You guys fight it out. Sorry for the long post</span></p>

I've been around, including living in the South, and have never met a KKK or Nazi.  These fringe groups are so minor in numbers I'd say we have more witch doctors from africa living in the U.S.  HOWEVER, we do have approximately 20 million (and growing) hateful and energized illegal invaders from mexico.  The clan with the tan who tramples on all non-mexicans.  First victims are blacks, then poor whites, ligit hispanics, etc.  Bringing up non-effective groups like KKK or Nazis is ignorant and acts as a cover for the true racism spreading from coast to coast, invading small towns, big cities, your neighborhood.</span></p>

This is our country, our families have put blood, sweat and tears into the soil of this land and I will support any LEGAL means to remove what ever is causing it harm. Time has a way going in a full circle, there have been times in our great countries history that the people of the community had to stand up and say enough is enough, if this was a group out to stop a gang or drug dealers the majority of people on this page would be praising them. I do not agree with everything they say they are going to do, but when its time to protect your home and family, sometimes you have to take steps that you would not normally take.  </span></p>

Oh, there are nasty, uncalled for, Racist remarks from BOTH sides of this argument but the "amnesty" crowd would love to have the ills of illegal entry drowned out by claims of Racism.  Their goal is to achieve acceptance and citizenship via politics rather than by protocol and procedure.  When I see the frustrations, comments and opinions come forth based on race rather than crimes and injustice committed by a racial majority, then I would suspect Racism.  Until then, La Raza and Private Police Forces just aggravate the situation.  Secure the border, deport as many Illegals as possible, catch and punish offending employers, increase immigration from ALL countries to support temporary labor requirements, convict ID and tax fraud offenders and deport those non-citizens when their time is served.  Stop the insanity of what is happening to our Multi-national culture by allowing so many of one culture to invade us.  </span></p>

They seem content in Washington to continue their politically correct pissing contests while our borders remain wide open for every illegal or terrorist that wants to enter our country at will.  These illegals need to stop being rewarded for breaking the law and if the government continues to refuse to live up to their responsibility to protect America and her citizens, then by god someone has to do it.  As far as violating the civil rights of illegals I say this.  They are illegal and have no "rights" as American citizens.  If they want "civil liberties" don't cross the border into the US and for those already here, go on back to Mexico and rely on your own government to protect your "civil liberties".  It is NOT the responsibility of America or her citizens to support or cater to illegals and their every whim.

For all you closet racists, do you really think the ACLU and many Mexican and immigrant groups are going to take this lying down?
What happens when an ACLU or La Raza activist goes into 1 of these neighbourhoods to test whether his/her civil rights is being violated.
I am Asian-American(Indian) but could possibly pass for a Mexican and I sure as hell won't take any crap from anyone who thinks I am here illegally.You can bet your ass I will defend myself &amp; raise all hell and sue anyone into eternity. I will publicize this to the entire world through Amnesty International and UN human rights body.I do have close relatives who work at UN human rights.

How are these thugs going to determine who is illegal??People don't walk around with passports.

In a way I am glad they are doing this because its going to hurt anti-immigrant groups a hell of a lot with the negative PR.

I thank God that my husband and I got out of Mexifornia last year. You are seeing a mass exodus of American's leaving that state due to the deteriating quality of life for those forced to live among these people who refuse to assimilate into the American culture. All they bring is crime, gangs, diseases that once were unheard of here, hospitals close and those that stay open are so over-crowded that you have a 4-8 hour wait to be seen in the emergency room (on a good day). I got tired of dirty diapers in the parking lots, on bathroom floors and even in the stores. English was somehing you rarely heard and God help you if you had to go to any government office. My hat is off to those Heros who actually are trying to make a stand and show people whats going on in our country.

According to California Law, it does NOT have to be a felony to make a citizens arrest.  If you're going to quote law, at least look it up first.
I don't necessarily agree with the PPF but it is important that we work with facts.  Seems like the big question will be "Public offense".

Why would they buy a car if they can't legally get a license?  Used cars from a buddy aren't charged sales tax.  They can't register without insurance, which they can't get without a license.  Any purchase requiring valid ID or SS info become moot to the reality of pandering to criminals using false information or ignoring those without it.

I am a patriot and the May 1st demonstrations really offended me, but I basically respect the dignity of labor and the courage of those who risk everything to better themselves.

However as the weeks have gone by the viciousness and irrationality of the "anti immigration crowd" coupled withmy growing understanding of the  inadequacy of our current immigration laws have radicalized me.  I can see the enemy much more clearly now and it isn't the immigrant or "illegal immigrant"  it is racism and hatred and arrogant and immoral privledge seeking to maintain itself and to do it with an air of self righteousness.

I agree that those issues are a WORLDWIDE problem and valiant cause.  I don't believe that it makes Illegal entry and abuse of our social systems more forgiveable.  Those that wish open borders would love for all of us to hide behind those principals.  It allows the crimes to continue.  There is only one Immigration policy that needs reform, that of expedited approvals for temporary workers from all countries.  It is Racial bias to allow so many to come through Mexico to our country illegally when the whole world wants to be here.  We need to adhere to our immigration quotas or America becomes culturally unbalanced, subjecting us to the devastating problems that would come with it.  It would be nice if Canada and America could convince Mexico to begin to emulate business and politics more like us, the World would benefit.

As a young woman I can say that your comments are ridiculous!! I'm 22 and not living on welfare not everyone is like that you make it sound as if all mexicans are stupid and just living off welfare. You know at my young age i've seen too many americans hating on mexicans. Just to make you mad!! I own my own place, have a great paying job own my own car and don't live on welfare as you stated many mexicans do!! we are not invaders we are just hard working people. I know more white folks and other people on welfare than you can imagine. When driving around town i've never seen a homeless mexican asking for money:) So think and look around you realize that there are good mexicans who work hard to get what they want my parent own their home they worked their way up so don't judge them because you are so ignorant.</span></p>

We are not all that far apart.  I am not for open boarders and I agree that the huge numbers coming from Mexico do so at the expense of others seeking admission from Asia, Africa, Hati, and Eastern European countries, who also want a chance to enter and bring their families.  

I am also concerned that we are going to be absorbing a large number of unskilled and uneducated peoples who have a high birth rate.  I see the preponderance of Catholic and Evangelicals also an ideologically conservative group that will eventually skew the electorate to the right on abortion, equal marriage, womens rights etc. 

I think a lot of the illegal immigration problem from Mexico is the result of trade policies between USA and Mexico that further impoverish the peasants for the gain of international corporations.

This is our sovereign right; the illegal alien has no right to demand exemption from this process.

You're right! But it seems that you assumed I'm blaming the "white man" for racially profiling people of brown skin. I'm pretty sure that there are many mexicans, costa ricans, cubans, el salvadorians, ect. that came here legally feel the same way as the "white man" in regards to illegal immigration.  But when you have somebody that says, "You don't have to hunt for illegal immigrants, unless you are blind, they are on any given street corner",  those are the people intensify the debate whether if this is actually an race issue or not.  My point is, you can't run around like a chicken with its head cut off grabing anyone and harassing anyone that looks illegal!  You will make yourself look stupid and will also get yourself into a lot of trouble.   I am against illegal immigration and I hope that there is an answer in the near future.  But when the U.S. is always taking care of other countries and not our own country, it makes me feel that illegal immigration is not a top priority on our Presidents list.</span></p>

The American Indians would set the aztec straight instantly.  Aztecs (mexicans) never had any stable population above the Baja desert and when aztecs did send scouting parties north the American Indians often saw them as demons and quickly eliminated them.  Same result when the aztecs ventured into Mayan lands looking for male human sacrifices.  There are so many serious lies being put forth by the racist component of the mexican population regarding who had what lands.  Mexico also lost their temporary procession of parts of the American south west in a fair war, then the U.S.A paid for large portions of land, some of which was lost in the war.  In addition, the aztecs lost their land to the Spaniards and non-aztec Indians 100�s years prior.  Another Truth - mexico is completely ran by about 700 super wealthy 100% spanish families.  In fact, mexico produces more billionaires then almost any other country in the world, and they are all white.  The average mexican is kept poor and powerless in mexico, as the Spaniards designed.  So when you see a typical mexican tell you they own the American south west remind them that they lost their land three times over and are slaves in mexico and should be kissing the hands of all gringos for "allowing" them to exist in the U.S.A.</span></p>

I am surprised that so many people have commented on this most important issue, unlike the Main Stream Media, and our Congress who certainly don't speak, nor listen to Americans, and Legal Residents (now Citizens) who waited years to Immigrate Legally. I met an American nurse at a County Hospital who came here from Asia, she was outraged that nothing was being done to protect our Country from Illegals.  She desparately wanted to do something, so she wrote President Bush. Illegal Aliens are doing more then what all of you have demonstrated.  Americans Social Security Numbers are stolen daily.  In my employment and years of experience a large percentage of our SSNs have and are being used.  I have seen up to 25 Illegals using the same SSN.  They probably don't keep statistics on percentages of Illegals Pilfering our SSNs, but I will say about 25% - 35% of Americans SSNs are probably being used if not more. Illegals "work under the table", with Employers knowledge and/or live off of Welfare, Wic, Medi-cal, General Relief, Workers Compensation etc, while working "Under the Table", or working using Multiple names and Multiple forged documents.  And don't fool yourselves the Employers know. Another important issue not Investigated or Spoken of by Media, Congress, State elected officials is Child Support, Welfare Fraud, Foster Care (part of welfare reimbursement), and Welfare Reimbursement.  When illegals apply for Welfare, Child Support Agencies interview them to obtain Child Support, Health Insurance, and Welfare Reimbusement from the non custodial parent. A high percentage of parents, relatives lie to protect the father or mother, stating they're in Mexico or whereabouts unknown, etc.  Mexico is used because they know Mexico wouldn't enforce the Reciprocity Agreement with the U.S., and now no longer has an agreement.  When that parent is actually residing with them under another name.  For years Welfare and Child Support Agencies  encouraged and trained employees to detect welfare fraud and report it.  Since the State took over it doesn't seem to be a high priority. There has been and is a large percentage of Welfare Fraud being committed.  Prior to the State taking over Child Support would obtain court ordered Welfare Reimbursement, including Foster Care, could be obtained from 3 years prior, unless there was an existing order or reserved order. Now the reimbursement has been lowered to 1 year and if their in jail or prison they don't pay either and child support doesn't accrue.  This is California Taxpayers Money being tossed down the drain!  The Pro-Illegal Groups, oh, excuse me Pro-Immigration Groups, some so called church groups help Illegals to obtain homes, bring in other illegals, and Conspire with them to violate the Laws of Our Land. I must say I personally feel these specific churches mock the "TEN COMMANDMENTS", Our Justice System, Education System, etc, and of course the American People. How do we explain this to our children? When this is not the American Way.  They are being programed by our Educators in so many ways, but on this issue they are busing, encouraging our children to attend/participate in demonstrations against us, our government, making demands, and to promote illegal activities, support slanderous comments, here their families and American People being called Racists!  Our Educators approving demonstrations, speeches within the school grounds or just outside the schools by Illegals and their promoters, but not allow the Freedom of Demonstration, Guaranteed to us by our forefathers, to the American Students or their followers.
Here's my suggestion: 
Everyone on this site copy and email or send all posted comments and letters to our Governor, State and Local Representatives, The President and Congress.
Then email your friends, and other blogs you use to do the same thing.  Thank of it as a Giant Chain Letter or better yet The Boston Tea Party reaching across America to show our Leaders to Abide to the Majority.  
WE NEED TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY!!!!

We have received threats of violence from Leftist Activists. We do not want to be confrontational in our operations and for us to name people or display our arrests; we would be inviting problems with too much adverse publicity by Scum Bag Liberals. About 5% of the people in our Santa Rosa Plateau communities have voiced defiance and have threatened us with bodily harm. One woman stated she was going to have us dragged by a car, others threatened house burnings. These liberals are all for turning California into a State of Mexico. They are driving the streets, trying to confront our officers. They hide their Mexican workers in their SUV�s and deliver them to homes in the area. The Border Patrol will arrest them for Harboring!

Our tactics have now changed. We file reports on Residents who Harbor or Hire illegals to the INS/Border Patrol, however the most effective reports are to the IRS. The Treasury Department is investigating all reports for Tax Employment Fraud. The State of California is very aggressive too and so Residents who Hire these illegals are receiving a Double Whammy!

We now have 186 private police officers with 22 attorneys, several photographers, many police officers and firemen and medical doctors in each area. We document all of our operations by video in the presence of attorneys, who are officers of the courts.

We�ve reduced the 400 illegal plateau population to less than a hundred. Home break-ins are curtailed. We are chasing them back home to Mexico because very few people are hiring them. </span></p>

REPLY: The term your looking for is "vigilante". The racist triangle of Fallbrook, Trafficula &amp; Murrieta is what you xenphobes really want to protect. Be advised, the demographics will change with or without illegal immigration. Working together and using diversity as a strength is a win-win you losers.</span></p>

I just drove back up the hill from the 15 and twice while passing through La Cresta and Santa Rosa West I saw men on bicycles who appeared to be day laborers. They sure were posed for supposedly being hunted by you invisible group. As for you claims of threats and harassment, I don�t believe a word of it. Where were you on the day of the rally in Temecula? What I think is, you are one person with too much time on your hands. I drive all around the La Cresta, Tenaja and Santa Rosa West area visiting friends and neighbors and no one has ever seen any evidence that you are anything other than a ghost. You are not real and that is why the media has not given you one second more of their time. Where are the arrest photos you promised, the addresses of those hiring or housing illegal aliens? I say to you, put up or shut up! All you are doing is running you mouth. If you are real, let us see some evidence. Oh and by the way, the legal system works both ways.</span></p>

NO society EVER survived mongrelization, ever.  Only the invaders, the criminals, want diversity simply because they have all to gain by taking from the host country.  To think of all the Americans (USA) who fought, died, struggled and worked hard only to give it all away to cultures who did none of the above.  It's called pillaging, but not by tribes on horseback or foot, running though a screaming village of victims.  This pillage is done by hordes on foot running though welfare, social services, hospitals and pillaging there.  And by offering menial labor services in exchange for setting up invasion substations and breeding nests.  It's a new twist on an old process - INVASION.
