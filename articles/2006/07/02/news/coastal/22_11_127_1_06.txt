			  <p>VISTA ---- With rallies outside City Hall, Minutemen and pro-immigrant activists squaring off on street corners and teens hurling rocks at deputies in riot gear, this city of about 90,000 residents has caught more than its share of media attention in recent months.<br/><br/>It has become a flash point for a heated countywide, even national, debate on immigration.<br/><br/>And in the neighborhoods beyond the well-publicized street corners, after the news cameras are packed up, people who call Vista home ---- parents, activists, city leaders and day laborers, whose presence has attracted so much attention, ---- say the increasing tension is affecting the city in different ways.<br/><br/>"More than anything, I'm scared to come to the park," said Maria Hernandez, 58, who looked after her two young grandchildren at Raintree Park on Wednesday. "But kids get restless at home and they don't understand."<br/><br/><b>Opinion varies</b><br><br/><br/>Much of the tension in Vista revolves around day laborers who stand on corners looking for work and the groups trying to shut their gathering spots down.<br/><br/>Mike Spencer, a Vista resident who helped found one of the anti-illegal immigrant groups, said he is concerned about the high levels of uncontrolled immigration into the country and into Vista. His group, the Vista Citizens Brigade, routinely spies on employers looking to hire day laborers at the corner of South Santa Fe and Escondido avenues.<br/><br/>"I soon won't be able to communicate in the language that the Constitution was written in," Spencer said.<br/><br/>Dozens of day laborers, most of whom are Latino, have gathered for years at the corner and others throughout North County looking for work. The men say there are different reasons why they seek work in that manner. Some say they get higher wages, others say they want to supplement their income from other jobs and others say they are not legally allowed to work in the country.<br/><br/>Spencer and other activists say they believe most of the men are in the country illegally and avoid paying taxes by offering themselves as day laborers. Members of the group and others, such as the San Diego Minutemen, videotape and photograph would-be employers and their license plates.<br/><br/>Day laborers who gather on the corner said last week that work offers have dropped dramatically due to the anti-illegal immigration activists, who they say are racially motivated.<br/><br/>"They are nothing but racists who don't want us on the corner," said Jose Nieto, a 71-year-old day laborer who said he is a legal resident. "There is no work right now, and this is a time when there should be a lot of work. There are people here who haven't worked in 15 days."<br/><br/>Nieto said he works as a day laborer because businesses will not hire him due to his age.<br/><br/>Anti-illegal immigration activists reject the criticism that their efforts are racially motivated. They say their ranks include nonwhites.<br/><br/>"If they were racists, they would not have accepted me into their group," said Claudia Spencer, a Mexican immigrant and anti-illegal immigration activist who is married to Mike Spencer. "We oppose illegal immigration completely."<br/><br/><b>Political action</b><br><br/><br/>Nieto said he plans to leave Vista soon to stay with family in Boston. But many other day laborers said they will stubbornly hold on to their corner as long as they can. Immigrant rights activists are trying to help them.<br/><br/>Members of groups of pro-immigrant activists, including the Coalition for Justice, Peace and Dignity, regularly stand by day laborers videotaping and photographing their opponents. The clash prompted city leaders into action.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, the Vista City Council voted to adopt a law that requires employers to register with the city before hiring day laborers. Council members said the law, which anti-illegal immigrants support, aims to curb abuses against day laborers ---- including employers who skip out on workers without paying them.<br/><br/>Council members reject criticisms from Latinos that the law is biased against Latino workers.<br/><br/>"The ordinance is not about race," said Councilman Frank Lopez. "It's to protect the day laborers in this community."<br/><br/>Pro-immigrant advocates say the new law, which was drafted by City Attorney Darold Pieper without prior public input, is a thinly veiled attempt to remove the day workers.<br/><br/>"Everyone but the city attorney seems to know what this is really about," said Claudia Smith, a longtime immigrant rights activist.<br/><br/>The day labor law comes in the midst of a national debate on immigration. Congressional leaders plan a series of hearings in the coming weeks in San Diego and throughout the country on proposed immigration reform plans.<br/><br/>Leaders in the U.S. House and Senate are at loggerheads over widely differing legislation. The House measure strongly favors tough enforcement efforts, while the Senate would provide a guest-worker program.<br/><br/>In Vista, Tina Jillings, who heads the Coalition of Justice, Peace and Dignity, said the city's day labor law also comes on the heels of increasing cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration enforcement agents that are creating a sense of fear and uncertainty among illegal immigrants in the community.<br/><br/>Sheriff's Department Lt. Hernando Torres said his department is accused by both pro-immigrant and anti-immigrant groups of being in cahoots with the other side. He said his deputies are expected to enforce the law without prejudice toward anyone.<br/><br/>"My personal beliefs stay at home," Torres said in his office where music in Spanish sometimes plays softly in the background. "Once we put our uniform on, we don't take sides."<br/><br/><b>On the beat</b><br><br/><br/>Torres, a 23-year veteran of the force who has spent a large part of his career in Vista, said the department is taking steps to make inroads with the Latino community. For example, the department developed a workbook that teaches English learners about the role of the department.<br/><br/>But Torres also acknowledges that the department needs to hire more Spanish-speaking officers to better serve the city. Only five of the department's 82 sworn personnel serving in Vista, and only one of the 38 deputies on patrol, speak Spanish fluently, he said.<br/><br/>"That's the problem that I have," he said. "Now you know what the problem is."<br/><br/>The language barrier may be contributing to the residents' sense of fear. Some say they are afraid to call on deputies for help because the Sheriff's Department sometimes works with immigration officials.<br/><br/>Last summer, three Latino men died in deputy-involved shootings that galvanized pro-immigrant, Latino-rights activists. The shootings also spurred grass-roots groups of anti-illegal immigrant activists to action.<br/><br/>Torres said his department sometimes has little choice in that matter. The Sheriff's Department has several cooperative relationships with other state, federal and local law enforcement groups, such as gang and traffic-control task forces.<br/><br/>As part of those task forces, deputies work with immigration agents to arrest gang members or set up checkpoints to catch people driving without licenses, insurance, seat belts or proper registration.<br/><br/>Deputies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 52 people for various crimes, including 30 for immigration violations, in late May.<br/><br/>It was the fourth weekend that the Vista Sheriff's Station has conducted the patrols with help from ICE officials.<br/><br/>Some Latino residents in the Townsite neighborhood say they appreciate the work deputies have done to help prevent crime in the area.<br/><br/>"I think people fear that if they call the police, the police are going to call immigration, but I tell them not to be afraid," said Jorge Luis Perez, a Townsite resident. "We have to help one another."<br/><br/>On patrol, sheriff's Deputy Bill Thomas is regularly called to help other deputies. He is the department's only fluent Spanish speaker assigned to patrol duty in Vista.<br/><br/>Thomas was called to help defuse a tense situation involving a Latino teenager threatening to hurt himself; he helped interpret for a Spanish-speaking woman involved in a traffic collision; and he spoke in Spanish with a man who said his girlfriend had left with their child ---- all within the span of the first three hours of his 12-hour shift Thursday afternoon.<br/><br/>"(Being bilingual) helps me because it helps me get my job done," Thomas said.<br/><br/><b>'Trust in God'</b><br><br/><br/>Another problem facing the Sheriff's Department in Vista is frequent turnover, officials said. Patrolling the city's streets is both demanding and rewarding, Torres said.<br/><br/>Deputies gain experience quicker in the city than in other parts of the county. When higher posts become available, Vista officers can point to a large body of work and are often promoted, Torres said.<br/><br/>That is partly why he took the Vista assignment, Thomas said.<br/><br/>"Patrol is a requirement for anything else in law enforcement," he said. "This is a busy city and things can happen at any time."<br/><br/>Latino activists say the city needs to create its own police department, rather than contract with the Sheriff's Department, because they believe such a department will mean less turnover, more accountability and greater understanding of the Latino community in Vista.<br/><br/>City and Sheriff's Department officials have said that the department provides a level of service that the city could not otherwise afford, including the ability to provide over 100 deputies and a helicopter on short notice, as it did Tuesday when protesters on both sides of the illegal immigration divide rallied.<br/><br/>For Hernandez, the Vista grandmother, and other residents, the trade-off comes in simpler terms. She said she has seen immigration agents arrest many people in the neighborhood. She has also seen many cars impounded at checkpoints near Townsite Park.<br/><br/>She arrived about 20 years ago from Mexico, she worked many years picking tomatoes, and she raised a family by herself. Her grown children are now sponsoring her to legalize her immigration status, she said. But she still lives in fear that she may one day be caught outside her home and deported, she said.<br/><br/>"We have to trust in God, and we have to leave our homes sometimes," she said.<br/><br/>Contact staff writer Edward Sifuentes at (760) 740-3511 or <a href="mailto:esifuentes@nctimes.com">esifuentes@nctimes.com</a>.</p>

They have themselves and much of the country worked up into a self-righteous frenzy with statements like Mike Spencer's: "I soon won't be able to communicate in the language that the Constitution was written in." Utter nonsense, yet many are ready to believe.   Why? Because prejudice, stereotyping, demonizing and scapegoating are primitive and common reactions, especially when things are going down the toilet, like now. But it's not the fault of the immigrants. They are just scapegoats ("one who is made the object of blame by others") and victims, too. Get real, nobody is trying to make everyone speak Spanish. When your leaders make preposterous claims like that, maybe you should reconsider. Or maybe you don't care about the truth.</span></p>

Immigration is a Federal law enforcement issue, but when the Fed's fail to do their job, the fallout on local communities is terrible. I believe courts have "in effect" provided a citizenship by several recent decisions, allowing access to social services by illegals. The courts have lacked "common sense" in my opinion, by their actions. If a person doesn't have the right to be here, then why should they have access to public schools, or subsidized tuition? The courts have expanded the definition of citizenship, when this is clearly the job and role of the Congress. Local communities are simply trying to "deal with" the fallout, and are not qualified to do so. This ordinance is another expansion of citizen rights to illegals. It recognises, and makes acceptable their right to work, by setting up programs to work around the illegality. They are not entitled to work in the U.S., so why would a local Government set up any program to work around the Federal law? Two reasons. They are afraid of being sued by illegals for not protecting their "civil rights." There is a misunderstanding as to what these civil rights are, because of the courts, but their civil rights do not include the right to work. Civil rights in this case, only provide for protection of their person, basic ememrgency care if injured, and access to the courts. Secondly, what are States, and local communities to do if the Fed's continue to act? I believe Vista City Council see's this as a work around to this particular problem. While they can not just simply pick them up, because they are illegals, thus overstepping their legal authority, they must find a "workable" solution to having them here, as long as the Fed's fail to act. Vista residents are just tired of having 100's of men standing on street corners, and see this as a violation of law. One, their not allowed by law to even be in the country, and two, they stand out there, seeming to 
"flaunt" the law. This is seen as defiance by many, and Vistans want something done about it. The propaganda war between the two groups is mostly an emotional one, where legal vs. illegal has been lost. On the pro-immigrant side they only see hard working people, coming for a better life. On the anti side, sadly, we do see some racist type comments. The question is, what is legal?  The answer is: they are here illegally, and need to go home, and do it the correct way. The rule of law is what gives all person their equality as individuals. If we become a nation of selectively enforced laws, we will be no better than most third world countries. Laws will be used at the whim, and plan of their leaders to "control" their citizens. </span></p>

Justice, when was the last time you needed the emergency ward and had to wait for hours in pain because there were dozens of illegal Canadians bottlenecking the process?  And Rita, I have yet to read about the Minutemen doing anything illegal in their efforts so your comparison to the KKK, in my opinion, is based on ignorance.  This is exactly the thing that keeps us from the main issue.  We need to direct our efforts at making it more desirable for our neighbors to stay home and raise their families.  Our problem is that nobody wants to be the first one to go into Mexico and martyr themselves in a grassroots effort to affect change over there.  So you all just keep putting out the fires, becasue nothing is going to change until Mexico gets their act together.</span></p>

This morning, I struggled through all the comments about the Mexican flag at the County Fair.  As I have said before, Rick Roberts (KFMB) stirred this up on his radio talk show.  He makes his living by stirring up one hateful topic after another.  That is his right under our constitution. But, no one is required to agree with him.  

Now, about the printed comments, pro and con.  The same people write again and again, and most are motivated by just one thing -- pent up hatred and anger. Most of these people probably have everything they want, but they still feel put upon by someone or some thing.  My guess is that they are picking on the illegal immigrants and the Mexican flag because they're afraid to attack whoever or whatever it is they really fear.</span></p>

I feel for the 71 year old legal citizen unable to find work, he should be retired by now, living on his pension so young people can get a job. His people are the one's that created the lack of jobs, by accepting substandard wages, entering the country illegally, when there weren't enough jobs for born &amp; legal immigrants to go around.

When you live in a country and do not bother to learn the language, then you are not attempting to fit in and become a part of. This is not a "racist" issue. This is an issue of Amarican citizens tired of their children being hassled at school for NOT being latino,( my son has been called little white boy more times then I can count, and my daughters and their friends white pun*as) tired of not being able to place an order at a fast food resteraunt without an interpreter, tired of social and educational programs being drained, just plain tired. All of this by a group of people who love it here so much, and fight so hard for their "rights" to be here that they show that love by marching down the street shouting the name of and waving the flag of a different county. I am sorry, but as an American, one whos family legally immigrated to this wonderful country of ours, I am tired of it all.

When they pump out kids at a rate that is much higher then real Americans you pay the hospital.    If illegal mom hits a guy with her car and has no insurance you fix it.    When their kids get our $10,000 a year public school educations you pay.   We could set up a trust fund that you pay into and all costs are billed directly to you.   If you can't or don't pay then you are deported along with the illegal you are responsible for.

The difference between them and the Ku Ku Klowns is that they are just more open to other racists.  It is true that Latinos and Blacks can hate their own people, especially those that eat up all the propaganda and lies from paronoid groups like the Minutemen.  For example, the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, has no love for his own people.  He is racist toward indigenous Mexicans and Blacks.  He would be a likely recruit for the Minutemen.</span></p>

I understand that no other modern country, including Mexico, obligates itself to provide work for illegal aliens.  These countries first obligate themselves to provide work for citizens.  Hence, America would only join the rest by prohibiting employers from hiring illegal aliens.  In fact, the host of negative social, economic, and political impacts fostered by the presence of illegal aliens presents a burden to American society at large.  Business interests favor illegal immigration for the low-cost illegal alien workforce.  Without a job prospect, however, the illegal aliens now here would tend to self-deport, and foreign nationals would tend not to come here in the first place.  Then, the axiomatic law of supply and demand would force employers to offer higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions to attract Americans to do the jobs that illegal alien workers now do.  Jobs would open for Americans.  Yes, costs might go up, but I believe most Americans would gladly pay more for goods and services if doing so meant the end of illegal immigration.  This debate has not ended.  Please contact your elected officials to insist on a prohibition, with teeth, against hiring illegal alien workers, and to say no to amnesty for illegal aliens.  America can find a way to get along without illegal aliens.</span></p>

Conchita brings me my morning NC Times &amp; coffee, orange juice and occasionally

If the illegal alien men can stand on street corners with impunity and solicit their services (under the table), then why the Illegal Alien women can�t also stand on the corners and solicit their services?  I am sure that there are a lot of maids, nanny's, masseuses, and physical therapists out there who would gladly work under the table with no regulation.  After all the women also have families to support and all they want to do is learn a living.  It is all legal in Mexico, so it would be racist not to let them do what they want here.</span></p>

I am not in control of the actions of the illegal alien, and I do not represent his/her race. I am in control of my actions, take responsibility for my actions, and represent my tribe. It is de facto or matter of fact or beyond my control who or of what ethnicity, a person, who choses to break the USA's immigration laws is.

There is no racism, from the Minutemen, except in isolated incidents, but there is a forceful resistance, being applied directly against an invasionary force, proportional to that force.

The Minutemen represent pride, in the USA, similar to the pride a Mexican would feel toward his homeland.

Expect more American pride being directed towards Mexicans, and the other day laborers.

Illegal aliens should go home, to their country, and make it what they admire in the USA. REVOLUTION!

Lt.

I only see Mexican being stopped, questioned and accused.�  Maybe Lt. Torres can tell us what the percentage of white people in Shadowridge and in the Lupine area are stopped questioned, interrogated and ticketed for going ONE MILE over the speed limit? This is where the truth lies, not in the PR regurgitated by officials that violate the right to live free from oppression, suspicion, and false accusations.   Mexicans have every right to be afraid in Vista because the sheriffs are out to get them with the help of the Minutemen.  It seems that Lt. Torres has been taking risk management courses and is well trained to deal with and manipulate the media and reporters. Why would the sheriffs department not spend resources training its sheriffs on common courtesy, improving their social skills; improving communications with culturally diverse groups, less edgy, snappy and bully? So where in the world is this captain?  Do the Vista sheriffs even have a captain?  He has never been seen maybe this too has contributed to the problems.  While Lt. Torres may fool the media and reporters he has not fooled us that live in this desolate city.

It may be inexpensive for the moment, but what it will cost us in the long run far outwieghts those costs. Hiring people who have no interest in becoming American who take advantage of every social service program so they can send every penny back home and bring more of their family here to work. Then retire in mexico. Please expain how this would be a good thing for us? How do you expect the people of this country to feel when something ($) is TAKEN from them without being asked? No I should say demanded. where and when was this earned? Yes we should be compassionate for those in need. But should we give so much that we can't even take care of our own needs? All you have to do is look at our schools being dumbed down, with no money for something so basic like transportation. We pay taxes to take care of things like that. But where is it going? To educate people who have no interest in even learning our language. And the hospitals lying to us about not having that burden. Why? Because of all the federal money they get. Do you really think it's fair for us to shoulder that burden against our wishes?</span></p>
