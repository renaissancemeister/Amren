			  <p>If an immigration reform bill moving through Congress becomes law, nonprofit organizations that help day laborers find work without making sure each client has a legal right to work in the U.S. could be subject to criminal prosecution, jail sentences and fines of up to &#036;50,000.<br/><br/>Two North County nonprofit organizations that provide such services to at least some illegal immigrants said Monday that passage of such a law could also lead to increased abuse of illegal immigrants, who would be deprived of the protections they provide their clients by screening and tracking those who hire workers.<br/><br/>In phone interviews Monday, officials with the two groups, Interfaith Community Services in Escondido and an Oceanside group called SER, or Service, Education and Redevelopment, said they help protect workers and employers by obtaining contact information from them before connecting laborers to employers and following up on problems.<br/><br/>SER officials said they check for documentation that their laborers can legally work, but that some illegal workers do fall through the group's screening attempts. Interfaith does not require laborers to prove their immigration status before seeking work through the organization.<br/><br/>Illegal immigrants probably make up at least half of Interfaith's clients, spokeswoman Debra Andreasen said Monday.<br/><br/>If the federal government cracks down on nonprofits that provide such services, workers and employers would stop using the hiring halls, forcing illegal immigrants further underground, Andreasen said. Interfaith's Escondido hiring hall helps arrange work for about 50 workers a day with local businesses and homeowners, she said.<br/><br/>Without the modicum of accountability provided by its screening process, the number of workers suffering abuse at the hands of employers would increase as workers and employers return to hiring in the streets, said.<br/><br/>"No matter what, people are going to continue to hire illegal workers," Andreasen said.<br/><br/>Bill would punish helpers<br/><br/>In December, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the bill, HR 4437. It is now set to go before the Senate for review and possible changes.<br/><br/>Critics have blasted the bill for focusing primarily on beefing up the nation's borders and cracking down on those who hire illegal immigrants while failing to create a guest worker program that would allow foreign laborers to stay in the United States for a limited amount of time.<br/><br/>Supporters have applauded the bill in its present form, saying that before the government can consider allowing still more foreign workers into this county, it must first show that it is serious about stopping illegal immigration.<br/><br/>One feature in the bill calls for an employee verification system that would require employers and hiring halls to contact the federal government and provide identification numbers on laborers' visas or social security cards. Those numbers would then be checked against databases to confirm their validity. The government would then issue decisions on whether individual workers can be legally hired.<br/><br/>The bill makes it clear that the law would apply not only to employers but to any organization that helps workers obtain jobs.<br/><br/>Organizations that show patterns of breaking the law could face criminal prosecution.<br/><br/>U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, said Monday he thought the bill was a necessary step toward the creation of a guest-worker program, because such a program will only be approved in Congress if immigration laws are tightened.<br/><br/>"The first rule is you can't have any loopholes in enforcement," said Issa, who supports a guest-worker program.<br/><br/>Andreasen of Interfaith said she worries that if the bill passes,  her organization would be prevented from helping illegal immigrants find jobs.<br/><br/>"They will find other means to work," she said ---- under conditions that may expose them to greater risk. "Abuse shouldn't happen no matter who you are or where you work."<br/><br/>She added that whatever Congress decides, Interfaith will obey the law, but the burden shouldn't fall on nonprofits that are simply providing a humanitarian service to the community.<br/><br/>"It should fall on employers," Andreasen said.<br/><br/>Fears of abuse<br/><br/>Highlighting Andreasen's concerns about possible employee abuse was the release of a study Monday conducted by social scientists from the University of California Los Angeles and two other universities, showing rampant employer abuse of illegal immigrant laborers.<br/><br/>UCLA, the University of Illinois and New York's New School University surveyed more than 117,000 day laborers at 264 hiring sites, in 20 states across the country.<br/><br/>The survey results showed that more than three-fourths of day laborers were illegal immigrants, and that 44 percent of those surveyed were denied food, water and breaks, in the previous two months. Nearly a third said they worked more hours than they bargained for, and 28 percent reported suffering insults or threats by employers.<br/><br/>Oceanside-based nonprofit SER runs two hiring halls, one in Carlsbad and another in Pacific Beach. Unlike Interfaith, however, SER asks all prospective employees, most of them Latino, to provide proof of immigration status before steering them to would-be employers, the organization's president, Salvador Martinez, said in a Monday phone interview.<br/><br/>He added that while SER officials do not check with government officials to make sure documents are valid, company screeners have become skillful at detecting obvious forgeries and those workers are prevented from using the company's services.<br/><br/>Martinez said he estimates that between 10 percent and 15 percent of its clients are illegal immigrants who slip through the screening process and get jobs through his organization.<br/><br/>The bill stands to increase the possibility that any hiring hall that works with Latino day laborers will be perceived as undesirable in the community, Martinez said.<br/><br/>"We are all painted with the same brush. If you look at the crowds of workers at our centers, you'll see a lot of brown faces," Martinez said. "(Government officials) would be looking at us as if we are helping those who are undocumented under the table."<br/><br/>Contact staff writer William Finn Bennett at (760) 740-5426 or <a href="mailto:wbennett@nctimes.com">wbennett@nctimes.com</a>.

I still work for a company who hires illegals.  It is a construction company.  Some of these guys are making $2000 a week or more.  This is a crime.  They pay no state income taxes or federal income taxes because regardless of their age they ALL claim married and 10 and go to the local swap meet or check cashing store and buy new id each year.  The crime is being committed against those of us who are honest, hardworking taxpaying citizens.  SEND THEM HOME.</span></p>

Most immigrants are hard working, tax-paying, law-abiding residents of the U.S. They live, eat, breath, get sick and bleed just like you and me.  Should we not heal them when they are sick?  (Or should we let them get sick and infect others)Should we not feed them when they are hungry? (or let them starve and die in a country that produces more food than almost anywhere....food they help harvest)Should we not house them when they are homeless? (or let them live in the canyons where helth, fire, and safety concerns affects those living in and around the canyons in houses).  What ever happend to the greatest counrty in the world that we thought we were?  The money we have spent on the war would have gone a long way to resolving many of our domestic issues regarding immigration, healthcare, poverty, and housing. It worries me when I hear people talk about immigrants calling them "illegals" and denying them basic services. When I was growing up we were taught that India eliminated the cast system.  I never thought we were going to resurrect it here.      </span></p>

The demand is here and supply is there.  There has to be a legal way for them to come here and then they will stop coming illegally. This will free up resources for protecting our country from those people who come here for things other then work - criminals, terrorists, etc.  Also people there have been here for years should be given a chance to stay here.  They are part of this society, many have families here with American citizens.  I don't see how sending them home will make it any easier for us Americans.  They contribute to our economy in a good way.  Let them get legalized and stop the drama of them having to hide here and always being afraid of deportation.  Use the money they pay for penalties to improve our broken immigration system. I am for a humanistic, realistic, comprehensive reform!</span></p>

If you want to support illegal aliens, do it on your tab, not on the taxpayers back.  Alice, there is a way for them to come here, it is called LEGAL IMMIGRATION.  They should be required to fill out the paperwork, wait their turn in line like everyone else, and apply themselves to assimilating into the American culture first by learning our language.  Personally I don't have a problem with Day Labor centers, as long as they are reserved for those who are LEGALLY allowed to work here.  You are right Unknown, I don't know what it is like, because I respect the law.  I have traveled to different countries and I always follow their rules and laws when in their country.  You are making more money here than working in Mexico and then you send the money you make, which is our Gross Domestic Product, back to Mexico, rather than it recycling through our economy to improve the lives of lawfully present persons.  Make a difference, go to Mexico City and demand that the Mexican government explain why it cannot provide services and employment opportunities for their citizens.  Mexico is the fifth richest economy in the world, there is no reason why they cannot afford to take care of their own.  They choose not to because it is a socialistic economy meaning that the rich and powerful get everything and after all, why should they deal with their poor when all they have to do is to export them to the United States.  It leaves more money for the elite that way.  You should be furious, you should be demanding that they provide for their citizens, that is what a government is supposed to do!  You better check your facts before claiming that the Mexican government understands the needs of others.  Have you seen how they treat immigrants arriving at their southern borders?  As far as Americans not going down there, I agree.  Anyone with half a brain should not be going to Mexico now due to the cartel wars and corrupt politicos.  There would be a lot fewer kidnappings and murders of US citizens.  It is not a matter of all of us "paying a little more".  It is a matter of taxpaying citizens and lawfully present persons subsidizing illegal aliens who have no right to be here in the first place.  Illegal aliens use a whole lot more in services than they ever pay in taxes, and they do it at the legal taxpayers expense while stealing a job that a taxpayer should be entitled to.</span></p>

The best immigration reform bill in decades to curtail illegal immigration (H.R. 4437, the Immigration Control Act) passed in the House of Representatives and it is going to the Senate. The bill is a tough enforcement bill with no guest worker programs or amnesties. Unfortunately it's going to have a tough time passing in the Senate unless our Senators get a lot of phone calls from their constituents. If you have never called or e-mailed your 2 senators, now is the time.

1. E-mail or fax your representatives http://www.congress.org/

2. Call. You can call toll free (1-888-355-3588) 24 hours a day. You can even call at night and leave a message. Most Senators have answering machines. All you have to say is " Senator.......I'm calling to urge you to support H.R. 4437, the immigration Control Act, WITHOUT ANY GUEST WORKER PROGRAMS" (The Senate wants to add guest worker programs). That's all you have to do. It won't take more then 5 minutes.

3. Register with organizations like: http://www.numbersusa.com/actionnetwork You can send FREE faxes with them. You can write your own faxes or use NumbersUSA's prewritten faxes. 



This bill is very good but it won't pass without a lot of phone calls, faxes or e-mails.

P.S. Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops but 25% are on welfare.

The Majority of the immigrants who come to this country are facing a survival situation which is most cases is life or death for them either from poverty and hunger or goverment politics and war.

I do agree that American Indians were treated badly...but I didn't have anything to do with that(or my ancestors for that matter).While it's true that the USA did not exist as we know it before Europeans arrived-those same Europeans created the prosperous country that it is today that aliens want to come to.

"While it's true that the USA did not exist as we know it before Europeans arrived-those same Europeans created the prosperous country that it is today that aliens want to come to. And as for what would we do without cheap illegal labor....Hmmm, what did we do before 'they' came here?"

Before the people (yes people, not "they" ) came here, you know what cheap labor this "European-founded" country used? Slavery. Even after it was made 'illegal', they still allowed the South to use it until around the 1850s. Also,  Europeans are not the only group which made the U.S.A a prosperous country. In fact, much of that 'prosperity' came at the expense of anyone who was not 'rich' enough or of the 'right' skin color. 

"I think that immigrants from all corners of the world 'paid their dues' by working at labor intensive jobs."

And yet they still do not benefit because much of the production that they produce does not go back into their economy but rather overseas into the hands of a select few. When they try to protest this, their words go unheard at best and at worse end up with years in jail or death. 

"Maybe there wouldn't be such a divide of rich and poor...middle class would still be possible. Companies would be forced to offer a Living Wage. We would probably pay a little more, buy a little less, more our own lawns, only converse in English....life would go on...Legally:)"

Not sure about the living wage idea, I'll have to read up on it. However, in a world which is becoming increasingly globalized, the notion of a country based on only one language is fast become a part of the past. In order for the United States to stay competitive with the rest of the world, not to mention to be more inclusive of its citizens, people will have to realize that being a bilingual (and eventually multilingual society) is a necessity. Even if we were to "converse only in English", which English would that be? Standard? African American Vernacular? Spanglish? British English? </span></p>

If the government allowed for Employment centers that help employ the immigrants and provide classes such as english and citizenship and perment secure and stable jobs it would benefit the US because we cant tax them if their not legal by forcing them deeper underground  our tax dollars are spent for nothing. If they were legal and we could tax them  then and only then could we profit from this immigration crisis. Immigration cant be stopped and employers would still hire illegal immigrants why should we allow for this bill to passs if it solves NOTHING!! WHY should the government force them furhter underground!! tHE FACT IS IMMIGRATION CANT BE STOPPED BUT WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER NOT ONLY FOR IMMIGRANTS BUT FOR THE NATION AS WELL THE ONLY WAY TO DO SO IS LEGALIZATION!! </span></p>
