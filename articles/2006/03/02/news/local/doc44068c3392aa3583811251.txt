<p>An incident in which a student&rsquo;s jaw was broken at a Davenport city bus stop may have been the result of ongoing racial tensions between some juveniles, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Anthony Matthew Hall-Clark, 16, of 2214 Farnam St., has been charged in Scott County District Court with felony willful injury causing serious injury. He was out of custody Wednesday and his next court date is March 30.<br/><br/>Police said there has been an ongoing series of incidents at the bus stop in the 1700 block of Main Street, a block south of Locust Street, and the incidents have escalated in their level of violence.<br/><br/>According to a Davenport police report, school officials told police a group of black students has been trying to make it a &ldquo;black-only&rdquo; bus stop and has been picking on the &ldquo;frailest&rdquo; white students.<br/><br/>The police report said officers do not know whether the incident that occurred at 2:50 p.m. Friday stemmed from the ongoing problems, but it noted that Hall-Clark is black and the victim is white.<br/><br/>The police affidavit alleges that the suspect went up to the victim and punched him in the right side of the face for no apparent reason. The suspect then ran away, but he was identified by an adult school official who witnessed the incident, according to the report.<br/><br/>The victim was taken to Genesis Medical Center-East Rusholme Street, Davenport, and was referred to an oral surgeon for treatment, the report states.<br/><br/>Tim Wernentin, the principal of Davenport Central High School, said there have been problems at the bus stop in recent weeks, but he had not heard that they were racially motivated. He said the incidents, which have been limited to the one bus stop, have involved non-students and students from different schools, but declined to say which schools.<br/><br/>Wernentin said school officials have been monitoring the bus stop daily and have disciplined the students involved with everything from suspensions to detention and also have contacted their parents.<br/><br/>&ldquo;This week, (the problems) have de-escalated and that&rsquo;s been because there have been police and school consequences,&rdquo; he added.<br/><br/>Sgt. Eric Court said police have been patrolling the area more around school dismissal time because of the problems. He said they monitor the bus stop when Central and J.B. Young Intermediate schools dismiss for the day. Court said the dismissal times are about 15 to 20 minutes apart and that about 25 to 35 youngsters gather at the bus stop.<br/><br/>Dustin Lemmon can be contacted at <br/><br/>(563) 383-2493 or <a href="mailto:dlemmon@qctimes.com">dlemmon@qctimes.com</a>.</p>

If this had been a couple of white students with close cropped hair they would have been charged with a hate crime for even being attacked by these blacks. Hate crimes are racist against whites and selectively enforced against whites. Justice is not blind it's dead.&quot;</span></p>

A "hate crime" is a crime committed because you supposedly "hate" someone who is of a different race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. ad nauseum. A "racially motivated crime" is a crime that is "motivated" - meaning that was the force behind the crime - by "race" - i.e. because of someone's race, a crime was committed against them.  This falls under the definition of a "hate crime". Do you understand now?&quot;</span></p>

Assault is assault regardless of the race or races of those involved. The term "hate crime" is code for "thought crime". The problem is the crime itself is not the issue- it's the THOUGHT that is being targeted. Hate crime legislation in and of iself is political correctness- it is designed to protect groups of minorities (i.e., blacks, gays, muslims...), not whites. In PC world straight,  white, middle-aged men are the enemy. We cannot be the victims because polical correctness says we are the oppressers. And that's ractist. Multiculturalism says basically the same thing about Western civilization. You know, America is evil, opressive, blah, blah, blah...
  Hate crime legislation just feeds our society this myth that we are all so racist and homophobic that we're going out and harming all these people- and that just feeds paranoia and distrust.

I'm not a white man nor am I black, so I know what racism is on both sides of the tracks, and I can aver with absolute confidence that blacks are exclusive, selfish, and they're the most racist of all the groups. And, no we're not all created equal, and shouldn't treat every one with the same respects. There are people out there who will take advantage of kindness, and they will take advantage of people who want to remain blinded from the facts, and they will view this as a weakness rather than a virtue, and in this instance it really is a foolish weakness, and not a virtue.

Whether to consider it a hate crime or a racially motivated crime is completely irrelevant. It doesnt matter what kind of crime it is. fact is it was a violent act among memebers of the opposite race. It is beyond me that people can label a whole race and think of themselves as anything but a racist individual. It doesn't matter if you are black, white, puerto rican, mexican, asian, indian or any other nationality, it doesn't mean that because you are a certain ethnicity that you possess the same qualities and story as other people of your race. I am neither black nor white just like the 1st person who commented, but i entirely disagree with anyone who could have such a narrow and ignorant mindset. To say blacks are horrible is completely false. I hate when people judge baseed on looks and previous experiences. Then again I guess only God can truly be so merciful and loving to completely forgive and forget our past. The truth is that we are all human beings who have free-will. We decide what choices we will make, not stereotypes. We as the individual can determine whether we will be just like people accuse us and percieve us as, or whether we will be successful, triumphant and undoubtedly unique. It is the mindset that just because out of all the people you may have met, that 90% of those black people or hispanic people or white people who have proved to be exactly what people describe: hateful, ignorant, and dirty, that (without even giving a chance to demonstrate otherwise), the other 10% will be exactly the same. It is a shame people have lost LOVE. Truth is that no matter how we may look on the outside we are all different and should not be treated equally with everyone from a specific race rather that we should all be equal among the human race. People I pray that God would soften your hearts and give us all understanding.. because otherwise our nation and our souls will die, due to ignorance.&quot;</span></p>
