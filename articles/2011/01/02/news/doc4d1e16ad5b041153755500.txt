		A clearly angry Steve Fetter, president of Canal Energy and Services, which was hit with a lawsuit for alleged racial discrimination in hiring just before Christmas, denied any wrongdoing and said he’s pulling his company out of Bogalusa because of people like the plaintiffs in the federal suit. He also warned that his business would not be the only one lost to the city.<br/><br/>But first Fetter said he’s not worried about the suit filed in federal court on Dec. 22.<br/><br/>“Number one, this has already been rejected by the federal government and the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) once,” he said. “The federal government has interviewed, looked and gone through all our records and dismissed it.”

In happier times, Canal Energy and Services president Steve Fetter, left, shows Washington Economic Development Foundation director Ryan Seal some of the big machinery he moved into the Bogalusa Industrial Park. After being hit with a lawsuit, Fetter now says he’s ready to pull out of town.

		In the suit 15 African-American plaintiffs claim that they applied for jobs advertised by Canal Energy, and that the company screened applicants to determine race and sometimes marked the applications of African-Americans with the letter “B” “for black.”<br/><br/>The suit also alleges that Canal had a “policy and practice” of refusing to hire African Americans, and that Fetter advised his executive assistant that he did not want to hire them.<br/><br/>Fetter said the applicants were not qualified for the positions he needed to fill.<br/><br/>“These people were positively not qualified for any position in the oilfield,” he said. “And the BP (British Petroleum) incident showed the consequences of having inexperienced people offshore.”<br/><br/>Such an attitude of entitlement is bad for business, Fetter said.<br/><br/>“Just as Chrysler left Bogalusa, Canal Energy is going to leave Bogalusa and there will never, ever be a successful oilfield operation in the city as long as the people in the city have their hands out and want something for nothing,” he said.<br/><br/>Fetter said he has called the mayor and plans to make a comment to the city council on the situation. He said he cannot recommend that any company move to Bogalusa.<br/><br/>“This is bad for the city,” Fetter said. “It’s a serious situation because of these yahoos who want something for nothing.”<br/><br/>He expressed anger, but not worry about the lawsuit.<br/><br/>“The attorneys should be ashamed of themselves,” Fetter said. “It has no merit whatsoever. The suit will be thrown out before it ever gets to court.”

Fetter would be wise to hire a PR firm to advise him on how to disguise his true self.  It is obvious what he is by his brash reaction and comments. I would be curious to see  a comparison of the qualifications of the white and black applicants in this case.  Why is it when blacks seek &quot;equal&quot; opportunity it is seen as looking for a handout? I predict he will lose this suit.  It is obvious that his own staff outted him for what he really is. &quot;</div><br/></p>

You can't escape it. I've been through the EEOC ringer a couple times myself and was cleared on both occasions. Unfortunately it's the cost of doing business in our litigious society. But why threaten to yank your business out of town unless the City is supporting the plaintiffs? Or unless you're angling for the City to cough up some kind of sweet economic development offer to keep the business in town? I hope that's not the case. Hang in there with Bogalusa. Most folks there are really good people. &quot;</div><br/></p>

The community needs to know why business doesn't prosper in our parish. I hope the Daily News can camp out on the front door steps of Ronnie Glen Penton's office and get an answer as why he relishes hurting our community and the honest hard working families in it? In fact maybe a large group of us should demonstrate at his office until he responds. My gut feeling is that all 15 of the individuals in the suit also filed in the  Chemical class action suit. &quot;</div><br/></p>

In additon, the city of Bogalusa nor any city or state in the US can control people in this manner.  Last time I checked, I thought we were living in a democracy and not a dictatorship. &quot;</div><br/></p>

Get over yourself.  Stop whining!  Are you realist or an idealist?  I think the latter.  Hos is Bogalusa any different than any other city in the coutrtry?  ....World?   There are those who will always want something for nothing.  Have you forgotten Katrina so quickly?   I bet at some time during your lifetime you had your hand out for something you did not deserve........Be honest with yourself! &quot;</div><br/></p>

Did any of you ever stop to think that there just may be some truth to the allegations? What company threatens to move because of a lawsuit? And how childish is he to call the people yahoo's? He sounds extremely racist to me and not professional at all. Do all of you have these attitudes because it stated that the people who filed are African-American? You are really showing your prejudiceness but that's typical Bogalusa, isn't it? &quot;</div><br/></p>

This is a serious matter and it is shameful that Ronnie Penton and any other attorneys would jump on this band wagon in an effort to make a quick buck and cause harm to our parish. <br/><br/>I work in the oil industry myself and you simply cannot hire unqualified people to do these type jobs. This is serious work that requires years of training and skill. Unqualified people will kill themselves and everyone working around them.
