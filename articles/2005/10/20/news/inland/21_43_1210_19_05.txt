			  <p>ESCONDIDO ---- Dozens of protesters from Escondido's Latino community packed City Hall on Wednesday, angered by the council's recent support for a proposed ballot initiative that would create a police force to target illegal immigration.<br/><br/>Carrying signs decrying the decision as divisive and racist, some seven dozen protesters gathered in Grape Day Park before marching into the City Hall chambers to voice their opposition to the council's decision to throw its support behind the California Border Police Act.<br/><br/>Last week, in a symbolic nod of support, the council voted 3-2 to back the initiative, which would establish a state-run police agency that would patrol the U.S border with Mexico and take responsibility for apprehending suspected illegal immigrants in California's communities. Mayor Lori Pfeiler and Councilman Ron Newman voted against the resolution.<br/><br/>Many of the protesters' comments were directed at Councilwoman Marie Waldron, who authored the resolution of support and is the chairwoman of Californians Against Illegal Immigration. Waldron has also been helping collect the 600,000 signatures necessary to place the initiative on the June 2006 ballot.<br/><br/>They accused Waldron ---- who is running for an Assembly seat in the 74th District next year ---- of grandstanding as she gears up for her 2006 campaign.<br/><br/>Some audience members held signs stating in Spanish that Waldron was against human rights for Mexicans and urging the community not to support her. Protesters left the chambers calling for Waldron's resignation.<br/><br/>"The responsibility of local elected officials is to represent and hear the voices of your community," said Christian Ramirez, director of the San Diego chapter of American Friends Service Committee. "It is not to use your seat for your own political agenda."<br/><br/>Consuelo Martinez, who helped coordinate the demonstration for the Escondido Human Rights Committee, a group that has opposed strict immigration controls, said the resolution went against the council's stated goal of improving relations with the city's Latino community.<br/><br/>As to whether the council was alienating itself from Latinos by supporting the initiative, Waldron said after the meeting, "I would hope that wouldn't be the case, because there has been a lot of support for enforcing immigration law by the people who came here legally."<br/><br/>Roughly 42 percent of Escondido's population is Latino, according to estimates from the San Diego Association of Governments, a regional planning agency.<br/><br/>Many in the packed auditorium said they work and pay rent and taxes in the community, and insisted they deserve the council's respect.<br/><br/>Many spoke in Spanish and used translators.<br/><br/>"Here in Escondido, we don't have anybody who represents us," said Mario Alvarez, an Escondido resident of 23 years. "But thank you very much for those who are attacking us, because you are uniting us."<br/><br/>Some audience members also criticized the council's decision to ratify the resolution during its afternoon session, despite organizers' request to hold the item for the evening session, after many residents' working hours. The ratification vote followed the same lines as last week's vote.<br/><br/>The border police initiative is the brainchild of Assemblyman Ray Haynes, R-Murrieta, an outspoken critic of illegal immigration. Haynes proposes creating a state police force of 2,000 to 3,000 agents that would operate on an annual budget of about &#036;200 million to &#036;300 million.<br/><br/>The new force would take on responsibilities currently under the purview of the federal Border Patrol, operating along the border and within cities around the state. The initiative would also authorize the construction of detention facilities for illegal immigrants apprehended by the patrol force.<br/><br/>In June 2004, the U.S. Border Patrol began operating a mobile patrol unit that conducted sweeps of inland cities stretching from Escondido to Ontario. In just two weeks, those agents had apprehended some 500 illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>The sweeps drew the ire of immigrants' advocates and the operations were halted a short time later, according to Border Patrol union officials. Border Patrol officials denied that the agency had yielded to political pressure and stopped the sweeps.<br/><br/>Supporters of the border police initiative say it is needed to enforce existing immigration laws, and would save the state millions of dollars each year.<br/><br/>A 2004 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington group that pushes for tougher immigration controls, estimated that California is home to 3 million illegal immigrants, costing the state roughly &#036;9 billion in education, law enforcement, social services and other costs.<br/><br/>Waldron said later she understood the demonstrators' concerns, but that the council's resolution was only symbolic and the initiative would come before the voters for final approval.<br/><br/>At last week's meeting, two audience members, one from Escondido and another from Temecula, urged the council to approve the resolution.<br/><br/>Contact staff writer David Fried at (760) 740-5416 or <a href="mailto:dfried@nctimes.com">dfried@nctimes.com</a>.</p>

If all of the protester's were legal, congratulations to them.  Illegal immigration is the issue.  You are welcome here, if you obey the rules, just like everybody else.  I have many Latino friends, but it is the illegal and criminal issue that is at stake here.  Don't make it racial; it's not.  It is about being here lawfully.  Very clear.   </span></p>

Of course those who are US Citizens are very quick to say something is not racist, but when have they encountered racism? We all know Mexicans will be targeted by this initiative and unfortunetely, that is why no one cares. Do you really think the Border Police will be stopping the European immigrants? I think not. How can anyone not see it is about race? Wake up people.</span></p>

Working under the table and paying rent do not contribute to the good of the state.  Our schools are overcrowded and English-speaking children are being pushed aside in order to give the Spanish-speaking more attention...in their own language (spoken and written).  This is from my own experiences with the schools here.  Also, no matter where you come from, you should learn English and live by the rules.

Mexicans are welcome here as long as they immigrate legally and live like Americans. Mexico is a horrible place to live, so I don't blame them for wanting to come here, but they should do it legally. And when they get here they should live as Americans rather than trying to make this country into Mexico. After all, why did they leave? </span></p>

So those who are here legally are racist for opposing a criminal invasion from another country?  (By definition, illegal immigrants are criminals).
 
This doesn't single out a single race.  But Mexican-nationals being the primary offenders, they will tend to detain more Mexicans.  (BTW, if they're illegal immigrants, they're not Americans, they're Mexicans.  It's not their race, it's their citizenship).

I strongly believe immigration is the strength of this nation, but I oppose all criminals.</span></p>

For anyone to believe that by deputizing the Minutemen your problems will be solved is pure lunacy.  The issue of immigration is a question rooted in failed US sponsored foreign economic policies.  Therefore taking a stance against the human rights of immigrants (whatever their status) is like taking a stance against the survivers of Hurricane Katrina since they had to resort to taking food from stores in order to survive.  The situation in Latin America is the same, except the hurricane that strikes every day and every year is man-made and is called NAFTA.  But for some reason, peole choose to ignore that fact.  And how can anyone be so ignorant to believe it is not about race?  The Border Police is supposed to look for "suspected" illegal immigrants.  What criteria will they use if not physical appearance, skin color, language spoken, and what side of town they are from?  What part of racial-profiling don't you understand?  I guess it is unfortunately true what people from other countries say about North Americans; they are a very ignorant people.  After all, most of you still believe we are in Iraq to look for weapons of mass destruction.  Speaking of Iraq, if you oppose illegal immigration, and "invasions" by undocumented workers here, then how can you turn around and support the illegal presence of the US in Iraq and a REAL terrorist invasion on behalf of the US in Iraq?  It seems as if the US is the one entering a country illegally and truly invading a country, it is ok with you.

I would love to see the 14th ammendment changed to clairfy the status of an American to include, Child of a natural citizen or naturalized citizen. Children born to non citizens are the nationality of the parent, not a citizen of the U.S..
This would help to make illegals think about staying home and working to improve their home country.

Even the "indians" who refer to themselves as the REAL "Native Americans" are fooling themselves.  There were no human beings on this continent for many, many years.  Dinosaurs used to own this place.  Asian migration took place during the ice ages onto this continent.  These are the "indians" who are in reality "Early Americans" who were simple fisherman, hunters and gatherers.  When the more advanced/evolved Europeans (English, French and Spaniards) first came to the continent centuries ago, they wanted to escape the overcrowded conditions of Europe and start anew.  The English took control of the eastern USA (which the land was to become), the French the central and the Spanish the west.  Eventually all three nations departed by the 1800s and left most of the land to the USA Government and some portions in the Southwest to Mexico.  Eventually all of Alta California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas became USA territory thru wars and treaties.  Does anyone with a brain living in the lower 48 honestly want to live under a third-world Mexican federal government?  To be honest, if so many Mexicans want to live in our territory, I suggest that the USA simply take ALL of Mexico so that we can ALL freely move back and forth and own land on both sides of the Rio Grande.  Face it, Mexico has had many, many years to get its act together and it simply ain't gonna happen.  Just let a great nation like the USA that knows how to run a ship take complete control of Mexico.  Actually, we might as well include Canada and just make it one big North America nation.  As much as I despise the current southern invasion, I think this is the only real solution to the Latin American mess.  Then we could easily seal the smaller border with the Central American welfare states like Mexico currently tries to do.

What about not letting any one at all come in our country.Were hurting for jobs anyways, huh??? Lets make sure that nobody comes in to the U.S. no matter what nationality they are.(Irish,German,Italian,African,French,English) They might be terrorists too. That fact is that the Illegals that people are complaining about are actually the backbone of this country. They work hard ,if not twice as hard as the average american does. We as americans are lazy.We really don't want to work as much as we have to.  We want our stuff fast and cheap. Meixcans and the other people south of the border just want to work. They don't want to start an argument. We treat them as they were second class citizens,and if they weren't worth anything. With out them We would have the new 200,000 dollar houses that could easily cost 500,000.When people think of Mexicans, they think they are all criminals.Most of them are not. They have families,and just like us they get up in the morning and work to provide food on the table for their family. Remember our forefathers were immagrants too, And If they were alive to see what were are doing to our country they would be ashamed.... I think they if we close off the border we should at least give the people that are already here a chance of citizenship, they are at least entitled that. After all this is the land of opportunity,right??</span></p>

Our country was founded on immagration. You can not stop terrorisim. This is a excuse that the goverment wanted to give you in order to close the the border. The government gets tired of the complaints that they get form the  southern states about the immagration problem, this is their only solution.
Not everybody with dark brown skin is a terrorist. I don't want to throw the race card out, but most of the prople that want the borders closed part of their decision was based on race. I agree with Frida. People say that they don't want mexicans here because they don't pay taxes?? The one's that are here are not aware of the process of citizenship. If they did know Most of them would try for citizenship, and pay taxes. The Mexican people I know
are very compliant with the law. They aren't drug dealers or gangsters, or what ever stereotype that people give them as bad people. People say that its is not a racial thing, Part of it is.If Bruce thinks that it isn't then he really needs to open his eyes. It's sad that we still use race as an issue, it's sad that as long as this country has around that race is a major factor. Everything in this country is based on race. They Never asked you what race you were wwhen applying for a credi card application?How about a college application? Everything in this country is based on race, wheather you accept it or not. I'm glad you have Latino friends, I'm pround of you.Most of those protesters are citizens. I reall don't mean to put you in the spot-light but that first part of that comment that you made "How sad. If all of the protester's were legal, congratulations to them. Illegal immigration is the issue." Is the kind of kind of thought that should not be encouraged. These are parents or grandparents that the government wants to send back, or charge them with an offense.Would you be happy if the government decided to send you folks back to their country because they weren't here legally. Let me ask you something??? Are your folks terrorists?? No, So why are we trying to do this in the first place? Think about it I Mean really think about it.This issues has many layers of issues, Not just a legal one.  </span></p>
