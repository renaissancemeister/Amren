			  <p>When it comes to cracking down on companies that hire illegal immigrants, the federal government appears to be missing in action, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office.<br/><br/>Between fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2003, the report shows that the number of work-site arrests in the United States by government immigration agents fell by 83 percent, dropping from 2,849 arrests in 1999, to 485 in 2003, the last year for which Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided data to the accountability office.<br/><br/>Another indicator of the downward trend revealed in the report was the number of employers who were fined for hiring undocumented immigrants.<br/><br/>In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued 427 "Notices of Intent to Fine" to companies across the nation.<br/><br/>But in fiscal year 2004, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which was formed in 2003 to do the job of the INS, issued just three such notices in the entire country, according to the report.<br/><br/>State Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Vista, said Friday that he was "dismayed" by the numbers.<br/><br/>"We are not enforcing the law and not demonstrating that we are serious about enforcing order and immigration law," Wyland said.<br/><br/>A top official with the U.S. Government Accountability Office said Thursday that the federal government needs to make drastic changes in immigration policy to control illegal immigration, as highlighted by the report, which he helped write.<br/><br/>The Government Accountability Office is an independent, nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch of the federal government that is commonly called the "investigative arm of Congress." It supports congressional oversight by reporting on how government programs and policies are working, auditing federal agencies for effective use of taxpayer dollars, investigating allegations of illegal and improper activities and issuing legal decisions and opinions.<br/><br/>The late August report, entitled "Immigration Enforcement: Weaknesses Hinder Employment Verification and Worksite Enforcement Efforts," shows a third indicator of the downward trend ---- the number of man-hours dedicated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to workplace enforcement.<br/><br/>The amount of time spent on work-site enforcement efforts dropped by 63 percent between 1999 and 2003, the report states.<br/><br/><b>Accountability office urges reform</b><br/><br/>Top GAO official Rich Stena, director for Homeland Security and Justice with the accountability office, said that for years the government has focused on enforcement along the nation's borders and security-sensitive work sites such as nuclear plants and airports, but has failed to adequately police other types of businesses that often hire undocumented immigrants.<br/><br/>"What happens is you put everyone on the line of scrimmage and once you get past the line of scrimmage, everyone scores a touchdown," Stena said. "What we really need is an entire reformulation of our immigration policy."<br/><br/>An effective restructuring would have to include several elements, he added, such as:<br/><br/><li> a method for determining the number of foreign workers the U.S. economy needs.<br/><br/><li> a reliable worker verification system that would allow employers and the government to know who is authorized to work in this country.<br/><br/><li> a credible enforcement strategy, so that those who violate the law can be dealt with.<br/><br/>"Right now, we have none of the three," Stena said Thursday. "The question is: How many of those people does our economy require and how do we as a nation get control over the work-site?"<br/><br/>An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that she believes the agency is doing an excellent job in the areas that are most important, such as protecting security-sensitive sites in the country and targeting serious criminal activity.<br/><br/>"The story is in post 9-11 era, (the agency) has protected national security and public safety, as well as (making) countless arrests of illegal aliens working at critical infrastructure and sensitive security sites such as power plants, chemical plants, military bases and commercial airports," said agency spokeswoman Jamie Zuieback.<br/><br/>In the last year, they have caught about 150 illegal immigrants at military installations around the country, according to Zuieback.<br/><br/><b>Wyland says enforce first</b><br/><br/>Wyland, who is preparing to run for a seat in U.S. Congress next year, said Friday that while he agrees with Stena's calls for a reformulation of immigration policy, he would only support the reform recommendations once the federal government has increased enforcement of the nation's borders and called Mexico to task for what he called its tacit endorsement of illegal immigration into the United States.<br/><br/>"The No. 1 element is showing that you mean business about the border,"  Wyland said. "Unless we enforce the law, there is no credibility to the rest of it."<br/><br/>He said the U.S. Border Patrol needs to hire thousands more agents to patrol the border and conduct inland sweeps such as the ones it conducted in June 2004. Those sweeps, which resulted in 11,000 people being questioned and 330 arrests in inland communities in San Diego and Riverside counties, caused a firestorm of protest from immigration activists.<br/><br/>"If you dramatically increased the sweeps inland and at the same time insisted with Mexico that (it help reduce illegal immigration), then you could have total reform," Wyland said.<br/><br/>A local immigration activist said that she believes that Wyland is extremist in his views on immigration. She said that the Latino community was outraged by the sweeps and that many people were stopped on the streets by Border Patrol agents simply because they were Latino.<br/><br/>"The sweeps resulted in violations of human rights and racial profiling," said Consuelo Martinez, coordinator for the Escondido Human Rights Committee, which has fought strict immigration enforcement efforts, such as the sweeps.<br/><br/><b>Causes of declines</b><br/><br/>The report attributed the decrease in work-site arrests and fines to two main causes: the shifting of agents away from traditional work-site enforcement as the immigration agency focuses on criminal alien cases and homeland security; and the increasing use of falsified documents by illegal immigrants to get work.<br/><br/>Under current law, employers can only be fined if it can be demonstrated that they knew workers' documents were forged.<br/><br/>"Various studies have shown that the availability and use of fraudulent documents have made it difficult for ICE agents to prove that employers knowingly hire unauthorized workers," the report states.<br/><br/>In addition, GAO's Stena said, computers and the Internet have allowed forgers to significantly improve the quality of forged documents that some workers are presenting to employers.<br/><br/>Referring to the drop in work-site enforcement, the report stated GAO officials interviewed several Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and immigration experts, who "noted that the focus on critical infrastructure protection does not address the majority of work-sites in industries that have traditionally provided the magnet of jobs attracting illegal aliens to the United States." Advocates on both sides of the immigration debate have said illegal workers are common in many fields, such as agriculture, hotels and restaurants.<br/><br/><b>Effects on families</b><br/><br/>Christian Ramirez, a local advocate for protecting the human rights of undocumented immigrants, said Friday that he agrees with Stena's call for a complete reformulation of immigration policy.<br/><br/>However, he said that whatever the government decides to do, it must not allow increased work-site enforcement to threaten immigrant families already in this country. If a working mom or dad is deported because of increased work-site enforcement, it would have a devastating effect on the children, he said.<br/><br/>"We have to recognize the fact that (some) folks have been living in this country without documents for 20 years, and we cannot separate families," Ramirez said. "Any reform that does not guarantee the integrity of families will fail."<br/><br/>The Associated Press contributed to this report.

<a id="39073f52ea7b668b35e4f392209b0b6f"></a><p><span class="simpleblog-name">Les</span> wrote on <span class="simpleblog-date">Oct 22, 2005 3:12 AM:</span><span class="simpleblog-response">It is nearing election season and a politician fancy turns to saying whatever they believe the people want to hear. Such is the case with all the chest thumping about illegal immigration. The problem is, after the election, nothing will be done, just like always. Let us review. There are about 10.4 million illegal aliens in the US.  500,000 more enter each year. They cost US taxpayers about 10 billion dollars every year. In California, there are about 3 million illegal aliens. They cost California taxpayers about 9 billion dollars each year, 750 million for housing 18,000 in prison alone. Even at the high point, 1999, where about 2900 arrests were made from interior enforcement, it would take about 3600 years before all of the 10.4 million were deported.  Too little, too late? (What an understatement!) The key is to arrest, imprison, and fine the business owners who employ them.  After all, you throw 2900 business owners in prison this year, and 2900 more next year, it will not take too many years before no one will hire illegal aliens. Moreover, when no one hires them, they will stop coming themselves; we will not have to put up a fence, or try to catch them at the border, or conduct interior sweeps. The ones with families will leave, sparing us having to deal with them, our hospitals will become solvent, our schools will be able to concentrate on math and science rather than language arts, we won�t be exposed to third world diseases that were eradicated in America years ago,� need I go on? Mexico will never assist in the solution; the money sent �home� by illegal aliens recently passed tourism as the #1 source for cash in the Mexican economy.  Besides, what will Vincente Fox do with 10 million more unskilled laborers? Mexico may actually have to institute a welfare system, after all, in order to live in the lifestyle to which they have become accustom, they will need to continue to be on the public dole.  </span></p>

Their "latinophiles", all of them.  That's why President Bush hasn't secured the border in any way, shap or form.  It's because he is scared of Latinos!  Poeple generally use terms like "homophobia" or, "Latinophobia" (that's a new one), when they have no legitimate argument and need only to resort to ad hominem attacks to distract people from the topic at hand.  Actually, I am pretty sure that Bush and the administration are the exact opposite of "Latinophobic".  Bush has appointed more "minorities" to top positions than any president in history.  However, I will say that it is painfully obvious that Bush is pandering to the Hispanic vote ( a vote that many Republicans believe should be there's because of the "family oriented" nature of the Latino community and because of Latino Catholicism).  The problem is that the Latino vote is a myth.  Roughly 1/3 are under the age of 18, another 1/3 are here illegally and thus not allowed to vote (except if they vote for Democrats using the names of deceased voters), and of the following 1/3 that are eligible to vote, roughly 12% are registered and few of them turn out on election day.  What Hispanic vote?  Assemblyman Wyland is not just thumping his chest, as some people have indicated.  He, Senator Morrow, and Assemblyman Haynes have been working on this problem for years, which is more than I can say about the majority of politicians.  People are so fickle--complain that no one is doing anything about illegal immigration, then complain when someone does something about illegal immigration.  </span></p>

You just DON'T disparage citizen volunteers in front of their nation after they exposed the reality of non-inforcement of our own laws for the entire nation to see.  Bush showed his allegiance, not to the country he was elected to lead, but to a foreign despot, and lawless employers eager to exploit pawns pushed across our border by corrupt and greedy governments south of the Rio Grande.  

Bush has no idea what non-governmental, non-union, non ultra-wealthy workers go through, just to make ends meet, educate, feed &amp; keep a roof over the heads of their own families - yet he worries about foreign nationals getting across our border to work for chump change so his pals can make more profits, while the taxpayers pick up the collateral social costs of educating, medicating and incarcerating these foreign nationals = what the he!! is he thinking?</span></p>

Heavy fines as we did in the 60's on the farmers and businesses will stop them in their tracks--nobody will work for free! Making a fine of $5,000.00 for the first offence then $50,000.00 for the second offence, Jail time of 1 year after third time. I think the fines were $1,000.00 then $5,000.00 in the 60's. It worked then. Give the Border Patrols a ticket book and 85% of the fines and J.P.'s the rest. We are talking incentive, in a few months they will have state of the art equipment and an influx of new Border Patrol officers.

And what did that have anything to do with illegal immigration in the first place. you my friend sound like a radical right populist. you're too predictable in what's comes out of your mouth. it's absurd how the common american struggles are equated to illegals. who doesn't struggle to put food on the table maybe you all should be ultra rich so you can stop complaining. is that wetback stealing that great glamourous job picking tomatoes to make you're guacamole from you? the reason the gov't doesn't do anything is because if in utopia all illegals were encarcerrated, deported, euthanized, beheaded, tortured, maimed what ever you fantasy desires; the us would face a shortage of labor that would bring the us economy to it's knees. California alone is the worlds 8th largest economy imagine taking 3 million people out of the workforce.

Without foriegn labor, the price of domestic labor would simply rise to the "natural" price. When the labor price is naturalized, foriegn farmers will be able to import goods at a fair market price and migrant workers will be better able to make a living in their own Countries.

Further, domestic farmers/employers will be encouraged to purchase, "automation products" to lower labor costs, thereby encouraging growth in other sectors. 

Our government believes that it is better to import millions of foreigners per year to avoid job movement overseas.  Overpopulation of the USA simply degrades the best business infrastructure in the world, which is being blindlyt traded for short-term profits.

Let the companies that can move out, most do not uderstand the full impact and will fail.  Reduce all immigration  and let the price of labor naturalize.

The Law of supply and demand will prevail in either case.  The longer we put off the economic crash, the worse it will be.

Anti-immigration not anti-immigrant.

The number is outstandingly high in the virginia area. It's unexceptable and needs to stop. I heard that virginia grossed over 7 billion in taxes for their pockets, coming from hiring illegals. They get to keep their taxes, they file it called a #999. I worked at a catering company, which provided service for the goverment. The dept.of commerce, white house,etc. The day may come sooner than they imagine, where an illegal (who hates americans already) plot to carry in some kind of device, hiden in their delivery truck. To cause serious damage. Is that what its going to take, to wake up congress. From the larger companies to the smaller companies, more and more jobs &amp; hours on the job are being taken over by illegals, causing us american citzins to move on, in hopes to find a job we can grow with. Although with the number of companies turning to the illegals (due to cheaper pay,keeping their taxes) its harder and harder for us to find employment. Maybe we all should file for unemployment, raise the number in that, to wake them up. Wondering why the unemployment has risen. I'm tired of paying my tax dollars to a country thats not backing us up. Heck we might as well just go to their countries and open new business and work there. Our slat would be wiped clean too, no background checks,etc. Enough is enough, action needs to be taken.
It so bad that, the catering company i worked for. Has so many illegals, they filed me as on. I notice my check stub, showed "no deductions" however they kept money from my check. In one of the box's it said #999.... How sad is that. I could go on &amp; on, not enough time in the day. If i had steady employment, i wouldn't be able to be sitting here writing this. I found this web site, cause i'v been pushed out again by illegals.

So I felt like I was being discriminated cause I was legal in the United States well I think its sad that when you are born in the USA you are supposed to have rights well we didn't have a choice but to leave when the company told a over 30 or more legals that they didn't have a job cause we were on light duty but I had a job that I bid for and it was given to me also cause i had 15 years at that plant. So how can the company tell me I had a light duty job if i was a janitor. I thought janitors at Swift jobs that were bid jobs cause i know 2 men that work out there and they have the same jobs i did and they were not on light duty but it was their bid jobs so my job was not a light duty job so why was teh plant crying i had a light duty job when i bid for it. And what this company did wrong was to fire me first cause i was supposed to be fired cause i was on light duty and my job was not light duty so why did the company really fire us for cause only someone stupid like Swift would say oh cause they were on light duty when tehy have tons of Guatamalas at that plant getting jobs. And Swift said they were not aware of having illegals, if you ask me that is so stupid of them cause Swift never had any bill boards every where requesting help needed or had a commercial on television or had all these flyers every restraunt has it posted up on the wall and the news paper has so many adds of Swift hiring. When did Swift have this in the past years after we were fired from there never cause Swift knew of every illegal that was going to work at that place. But the government didn't do a damn thing about it cause they found them not guilty. Am i smarter than the government or is the government just backing Swift cause why does every place that hires illegals gets a penalty but Swift had over a thousand illegals but did not get fined. And Swift is just laughing cause ICE didn't go when the night shift went in, or was it cause they gave Swift a chance to keep there night shift so Swift would not be left out of employees cause there is tons of illegals working still on that shift. I had reported Swift in 2002 and I went and made my report to the immagration office in Amarillo, Tx and never did they do anything about it but it took someone who had lost ther ID for immagration to listen to them and I was not afraid cause i was being asked if i was sure i said yes and plenty of other poeple reported Swift but immagration never listened to the other poeple either. so it took 4 years for immagration to finally listen why cause other poeple were complaining. I know i am 100% right of everything i have said here.   </span></p>
