<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/happiness_formula/5012478.stm">Does Diversity Make Us Unhappy?</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Easton, BBC News, May 30, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is an uncomfortable conclusion from happiness research data perhaps &mdash; but multicultural communities tend to be less trusting and less happy. </p>
<p>Research by the Home Office suggests that the more ethnically diverse an area is, the less people are likely to trust each other. </p>
<p>The Commission for Racial Equality has also done work looking at the effect of diversity on well-being. </p>
<p>Interviewed on The Happiness Formula, the chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, Trevor Phillips accepts that people are happier if they are with people like themselves. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done work here which shows that people, frankly, when there aren&rsquo;t other pressures, like to live within a comfort zone which is defined by racial sameness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;People feel happier if they&rsquo;re with people who are like themselves. But the question is: what does &ldquo;like themselves&rdquo; mean?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tapestry of life </p>
<p>To an extent, new immigrants are always seen as outsiders and threatening. It is not necessarily a matter of ethnicity. </p>
<p>The arrival of the Huguenots or the Jews into Britain brought significant social tensions which have largely disappeared. </p>
<p>Cultural difference eventually became woven into the tapestry of British life. </p>
<p>Globalisation has brought new challenges &mdash; a diversity of culture and ethnicity never seen before. </p>
<p>There have been fierce arguments as to whether social well-being is enhanced by celebrating difference or encouraging integration, even assimilation. </p>
<p>Trevor Phillips believes the debate has become dangerously confused. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our multiculturalism which started out as a straightforward recognition of diversity became a sort of system which prized racial and ethnic difference above all other values and there lies the problem.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So, if we want happy, stable communities, where should the balance lie between diversity and integration? </p>
<p>Trevor Phillips believes getting it right is vital: &ldquo;We need to respect people&rsquo;s ethnicity but also give them, at some point in the week, an opportunity to meet and want to be with people with whom they have something in common that isn&rsquo;t defined by their ethnicity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can find a moment, an idea, an activity which takes us out of our ethnicity and connects us to other people of different ethnicities and if only for an hour in a week then I think we can crack this problem.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Social science is also trying to help make sense of the challenges. </p>
<p>Building bridges </p>
<p>In the jargon, they refer to the factors that bind similar people together in groups as &ldquo;bonding social capital&rdquo;. </p>
<p>But it is argued that happy societies also need what they call &ldquo;bridging social capital&rdquo; &mdash; strong links between different groups. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A society that has only bonding social capital and no bridging social capital looks like Beirut or Belfast or Bosnia, that is tight communities but isolated from one another.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So says Harvard professor Robert Putnam, author of &ldquo;Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community&rdquo;. </p>
<p>He argues that working out how to grow bridging capital is the great challenge for Western society. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the crux of the problem. The kind of social capital that is most important for the success of a modern, pluralist, multicultural democracy &mdash; the bridging social capital &mdash; is the kind that&rsquo;s hardest to build. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore we&rsquo;ve got to go about the task of creating new opportunities for people to make connections to people different from them. </p>
<p>When bonding social capital drowns bridging social capital, conflict is inevitable. </p>
<p>Shared values </p>
<p>Trevor Phillips believes we saw it all too clearly in the disturbances in the Lozells area of Birmingham in the Summer of 2005. </p>
<p>A tight-knit Asian community came into conflict with a tight-knit black community because, Phillips argues, the ethnicity that binds each community together is stronger than the links between them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two communities who more or less faced each other across a single road. They are communities which have high levels of internal bonding. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But actually there wasn&rsquo;t and is very little bridging between these two communities and I think this is a perfect demonstration of what happens when people who are very different, look very different and think they are very different never touch, never interact.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What is required is a sense of identity that overarches creed, culture or ethnic background. </p>
<p>Nation states take different views on how this might best be achieved. The French model is to have a strict definition of Frenchness that, for instance, prohibits religious head-scarves in schools. </p>
<p>In the UK, citizenship ceremonies for new arrivals and lessons in schools are built around the ideas of shared values including an understanding of and respect for our democratic institutions. </p>
<p>Among those values is a tolerance of diversity and cultural difference. </p>
<p>But it is, perhaps, in sport that the efforts to build bridging social capital are most obvious. </p>
<p>Whether it be two football teams from different local communities breaking down barriers or an Olympic squad reflecting the multi-racial reality of modern Western society, competitive sport is seen as an important tool in binding together diverse nations and making people happy.</p>
