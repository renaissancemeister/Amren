<p>As we look forward to a massive slewing away from the dominance of European whites in America, what may we expect? What will these huge minority populations do? It is instructive to look at what they have done so far. </p>
<p>Some thirteen percent of the country is now black, and thirteen percent Latino: over a quarter in all. Blacks remain intractably far below the white population academically. An astounding proportion can&rsquo;t read, and of those who can, few do. The gap hasn&rsquo;t closed, despite Head Start, integrated schools, segregated schools, more funding, welfare, black teachers, black school boards, black mayors, remedial instruction, or anything else. </p>
<p>The gap appears on every known test of mental capacity or scholarly achievement &mdash; SATs, GREs, ACT, LSATs, MedCats, Stanford-Binet, Wechsler, Raven&rsquo;s matrices. Nothing makes a difference. Everything has been tried. Because of this, we got affirmative action or, as kids once said, make believe.</p>
<p>Further, blacks are not assimilating. Despite pushing, shoving, laws, legislation, regulation, and relentless indoctrination, the races are not melding at a rate that will produce results any time soon. The huge black necrotic regions of the cities, that whites never see, are so big and isolated as to be impervious to outside influence. If you have not spent time in police cars in such places, you cannot imagine the hopelessness and hatred that brood there. If you think that &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; is too hard a word, go look. I have. Whether the hatred is justified doesn&rsquo;t matter. It exists. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Everyone says, &ldquo;But the Hispanics work hard.&rdquo; They do indeed, in the first generation. Many people in fields such as construction have told me that the Latinos are the backbone of their operations, that blacks don&rsquo;t want to work, have attitudes, show up if they feel like it and quit without warning. The Latinos work, now. Their children do terribly in school, however, drop out, and lose the desire to work. Then they join gangs.</p>
<p>Nice white people don&rsquo;t know about gangs. Maybe they think of West Side Story. I used to ride in Chicago, with the PD and with the South Side Gang Initiative, a federally funded program in the rotting satellite cities, Markham, Robbins, and Fort Ord. I saw the gangs. There were the Black Gangster Disciples, the Vice Lords, the Latin Kings, the Latin Cobras, the P Stones, the El Ruykins who came out of the old Blackstone Rangers and, earlier, Blackstone Raiders. They aren&rsquo;t the Jets, people. They&rsquo;re killers. And they loathe white America.</p>
<p>I once interviewed a ranking Vice Lord in the Cook Country Jail. Why, I asked, did blacks kill each other so much? &ldquo;They&rsquo;d rather kill whites,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but they know they&rsquo;d lose.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a lot of that. When I left Washington four years ago, Mara Salvatrucha (look on the web) was appearing in Arlington, Virginia, and now their graffiti are show up in Springfield, Virginia.</p>
<p>Law enforcement in America relies on having a white population that is mostly law-abiding. It has no good way of responding to large numbers of violent criminals, especially when they are backed by politically potent voting blocs. The crucial question, or a crucial question, is what proportion of the new minorities will fall into the permanent underclass? How much permanent underclass can the nation stand?</p>
<p>Another crucial question is this: If half the children today are of minorities, then in no more than eighteen years half the kids of college age will be. Unless they show a sudden scholarly afflatus which has not heretofore been in evidence, this means that soon the US will have to compete with China with the brains of only half the nation. This is not to mention secondary effects, such as enstupidating all schools to hide the failures of the minorities. Do you suppose that the Chinese are doing that?</p>
<p>Now, from the same story in the Washington Post, this: &ldquo;William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, predicted that the United States will have &lsquo;a multicultural population that will probably be more tolerant, accommodating to other races and more able to succeed in a global economy.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>How heart-warming. I suggest that William H. Frey is a thoroughgoing fool, but this is common among academics.The whole touchy-feely multy-culty idea that forcing people together will make them love one another, kum bah yah, is simply wrong. Right now, there is a tremendous repressed hostility between blacks and whites, the lid being held on by federal power, tight control of the press, and rigorous political correctness. Whites, huge numbers of them, detest Latino immigrants and would love to expel them from the country. Serious friction grows between blacks and Latinos as Latinos push blacks out of regions they once controlled. We&rsquo;re not moving toward accommodation. We&rsquo;re moving toward trouble. </p>
<p>What will happen as the economy declines and the minorities continue growing in number? As they continue demanding through political power what they cannot obtain on their merits? As standards of living drop, and the pie isn&rsquo;t creamy enough to give everyone juicy freebies? </p>
