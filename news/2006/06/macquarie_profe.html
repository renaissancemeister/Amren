<h1>Macquarie Professor Lodges HREOC Complaints Alleging Political Discrimination And Anti-White Racial Vilification</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Prof. Andrew Fraser, Press Release,  June 26, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Associate Professor of law Andrew Fraser will provide the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission today with documentary evidence supporting his complaint of political discrimination against Macquarie University.</p>
<p>In July 2005, Professor Fraser wrote a controversial letter to the Parramatta Sun in which he suggested that large-scale immigration from black Africa could lead to increasing levels of crime, violence and a wide range of other social problems.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, Macquarie University was subjected to intense political pressure from black African organisations, the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies and many other &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; activist groups and individuals demanding that Professor Fraser be sacked.</p>
<p>Soon after returning from overseas, the then Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University, Professor Di Yerbury declared that Professor Fraser&rsquo;s view were &ldquo;repugnant&rdquo; to her, offering a series of apologies on behalf of the University to African migrant groups.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor also sought to procure Professor Fraser&rsquo;s immediate resignation, offering to buy out his one-year pre-retirement contract which is due to terminate on June 30, 2006. When Professor Fraser declined that offer, the University immediately cancelled his classes and suspended him from teaching.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the University lent its weight to an organised campaign of political intimidation aimed at Professor Fraser. It sponsored a &ldquo;Racism Within&rdquo; forum (really a latter-day Stalinist show-trial) where hundreds of Macquarie academics and students gathered to denounce Professor Fraser&rsquo;s alleged &ldquo;extreme racism&rdquo; in terms bordering on the hysterical.</p>
<p>Despite assurances from his Dean that Professor Fraser would be permitted to resume teaching once Professor Yerbury had resigned in early February 2006, the University cancelled his classes once again in the first semester of the current academic year.</p>
<p>The decision to suspend Professor Fraser this year was taken explicitly because his political views on race were deemed likely to influence his approach to the subject he was set to teach; namely, American Constitutional History.</p>
<p>Professor Fraser will be retiring from Macquarie University at the end of this week. Unlike other academic retirees who intend to remain research-active, he has been denied the status of an Honorary Associate which would entitle him to library privileges facilitating research into his next book on Anglophobia: Its Causes and Cure. That petty academic vindictiveness is the latest step in a year-long campaign of discrimination by the University against his political heresies.</p>
<p>In a case of turnabout is fair play, Professor Fraser also has lodged a complaint against the Parramatta Sun and its editor Charles Boag. The Human Rights Commission declared Professor Fraser&rsquo;s observations on black crime to be an unlawful form of racial vilification. But the same issue of the Parramatta Sun that published Professor Fraser&rsquo;s allegedly &ldquo;racist&rdquo; letter carried a signed editorial by Charles Boag asserting that it is mere &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo; to worry about black crime in light of the notorious record of  &ldquo;murder and mayhem on a great scale&rdquo; committed by white Europeans, here in Australia and elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>Professor Fraser looks forward to finding out whether the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is, as advertised, a neutral and impartial investigative body. He hopes that a double standard will not be applied by the Commission allowing white Europeans to be subjected to wholesale &ldquo;racial vilification&rdquo; while suffering blatant political discrimination whenever they protest the loss of their freedoms and their ancestral homelands.</p>
<p>He is, however, not at all confident that his hope will be fulfilled.</p>
