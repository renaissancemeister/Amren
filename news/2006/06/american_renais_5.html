	If you haven&rsquo;t subscribed to American Renaissance yet, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing in the June 2006 issue: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		In &ldquo;Blacks and High Steel,&rdquo; iron-worker Thomas Dilberger tells of the decline in the construction industry since affirmative action introduced blacks into the trade. He knows from long experience that the great majority of blacks are incapable of the intellectually demanding tasks required to build steel frames for buildings. There is also the problem of getting blacks to work at all: he recounts many examples of blacks&rsquo; &ldquo;child-like&rdquo; excuses to avoid work. As a consequence, blacks are given only the easiest work, and the hard work falls to whites. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>American Renaissance</i> editor <a href="https://archive.jaredtaylor.org/">Jared Taylor</a> reviews Prof. Richard Lynn&rsquo;s new book <i>Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis</i>, which contains the most thorough collection of world-wide IQ data ever. Prof. Lynn finds sub-Saharan black Africans have an average IQ of 67 &mdash; for Bushmen the average is even lower at 54. Australian aborigines also have very low IQs &mdash; their average is 62. However, even these low IQ groups have abilities beyond those of whites in specific tasks that are necessary for them &mdash; Bushmen are better than whites at judging the size of distant objects, an ability useful in hunting; Australian aborigines exceed whites in spatial intelligence, which is useful for finding one&rsquo;s way in the Australian desert. Whites have average IQs of 100 and East Asians, of 105. Prof. Lynn believes their superior intelligence is an adaptation to the cold climates whites and East Asians had to survive in. 
	</li>
	<li>
		In &ldquo;Texas Showdown,&rdquo; former AR assistant editor Scott Wilson describes Jared Taylor&rsquo;s debate over Hispanic immigration with Jose Angel Gutierrez, who is a professor of political science at the University of Texas and supports Mexican reconquest of the Southwest. Mr. Taylor cited statistics on Hispanic poverty, dropout rates, criminality, and out-of-wedlock births showing the Hispanic influx was bad for America. Prof. Gutierrez made no argument that Hispanic immigration had been good for America, but he said Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s statistics merely proved Hispanics had suffered from racism. Prof. Gutierrez went on to claim whites had &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; the Southwest from Mexico. He also quoted American Renaissance articles and accused its supporters of being &ldquo;sick people.&rdquo; 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Plus news on the outlawing of dissent from racial orthodoxy in Europe, the revolt against day-laborer centers in Herndon, Va., and the British National Party&rsquo;s success in local elections.
