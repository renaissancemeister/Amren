						<i>Booth Tarkington, American Renaissance, August 2004</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p><font size="3">Booth 
                    Tarkington (1869&mdash;1946) was an Indiana novelist who won 
                    Pulitzer prizes for </font></i><font size="3">The Magnificent 
                    Ambersons <i>(1918) and </i>Alice Adams <i>(1921), but is 
                    best known for three books about a middle-class boy named 
                    Penrod. The first of the series, titled simply </i>Penrod 
                    <i>(1913), contains an incident in which the boy&rsquo;s eyes 
                    are opened in much the way those of the previous contributor&rsquo;s 
                    were opened years ago in a high school cafeteria. Tarkington 
                    was a liberal for his time, but wrote before delusions about 
                    race had become quite so well established.</i></font></font></p>
                  <i>
                  <p><font size="3">Penrod, age 11, has struck 
                    up an acquaintance with Rupe Collins, a tough guy and bully 
                    from the other side of the tracks. Penrod is fascinated by 
                    Rupe&rsquo;s swaggering ways and starts imitating them. Rupe 
                    likes to put his face right up to someone else&rsquo;s and 
                    threaten violence, and Penrod has tried this on his friend 
                    Sam Williams, and on two Negro playmates, the brothers Herman 
                    and Verman, who live in a nearby alley. They take it cheerfully, 
                    but when the bully himself gives Herman the look and threatens 
                    violence, the results are different:</font></p>
                  </i> 
                  <p></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;You ole black nigger,&#148; 
                    Rupe said venomously to Herman, &#147;I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; 
                    to&mdash;&mdash;&#148;</font></p>
                  </font> <font size="3">
                  <p><font size="3">But he had allowed his nose 
                    to remain too long near Herman&rsquo;s. Penrod&rsquo;s familiar 
                    nose had been as close with only a ticklish spinal effect 
                    upon the not very remote descendant of Congo man-eaters. The 
                    result produced by the glare of Rupe&rsquo;s unfamiliar eyes, 
                    and by the dreadfully suggestive proximity of Rupe&rsquo;s 
                    unfamiliar nose, was altogether different. Herman&rsquo;s and 
                    Verman&rsquo;s Bangala great-grand-fathers never considered 
                    people of their own jungle neighbourhood proper material for 
                    a meal; but they looked upon strangers&mdash;especially truculent 
                    strangers&mdash;as distinctly edible. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Penrod and Sam heard Rupe 
                    suddenly squawk and bellow &hellip; .</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Then they separated&mdash;and 
                    battle was on!</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">How neat and pure is the task 
                    of the chronicler who has the tale to tell of a &#147;good 
                    rousing fight&#148; between boys or men who fight in the &#147;good 
                    old English way,&#148; according to a model set for fights 
                    in books long before Tom Brown went to Rugby. There are seconds 
                    and rounds and rules of fair-play, and always there is great 
                    good feeling in the end &hellip; .</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">But, when Herman and Verman 
                    set to, the record must be no more than a few fragments left 
                    by the expurgator. It has been perhaps sufficiently suggested 
                    that the altercation in the stable opened with mayhem in respect 
                    to the aggressor&rsquo;s nose. Expressing vocally his indignation 
                    and the extremity of his pained surprise, Mr. Collins stepped 
                    backward, holding his left hand over his nose, and striking 
                    at Herman with his right. Then Verman hit him with the rake.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Verman struck from behind. 
                    He struck as hard as he could. And he struck with the tines 
                    down. For, in his simple, direct, African way he wished to 
                    kill his enemy, and he wished to kill him as soon as possible. 
                    That was his single, earnest purpose.</font></p>
                  </font> 
                  <table width="315" align="right">
                    <tr> 
                      <td height="287"> 
                        <div align="right"><img src="/news/2006/06/TROOPSsml.JPG" width="288" height="281"></div>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <font size="3">
                  <p><font size="3">On this account, Rupe Collins 
                    was peculiarly unfortunate. He was plucky and he enjoyed conflict; 
                    but neither his ambitions nor his anticipations had ever included 
                    murder. He had not learned that an habitually aggressive person 
                    runs the danger of colliding with beings in one of those lower 
                    stages of evolution wherein theories about &#147;hitting below 
                    the belt&#148; have not yet made their appearance.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The rake glanced from the 
                    back of Rupe&rsquo;s head to his shoulder; but it felled him. 
                    Both darkies jumped full upon him instantly, and the three 
                    rolled and twisted upon the stable floor, unloosing upon the 
                    air sincere maledictions closely connected with complaints 
                    of cruel and unusual treatment; while certain expressions 
                    of feeling presently emanating from Herman and Verman indicated 
                    that Rupe Collins, in this extremity, was proving himself 
                    not too slavishly addicted to fighting by the rules.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">From the panting, pounding, 
                    yelling heap issued words and phrases hitherto quite unknown 
                    to Penrod and Sam &hellip; . Appalled, the two spectators retreated 
                    to the doorway nearest the yard, where they stood dumbly watching 
                    the cataclysm.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The struggle increased in 
                    primitive simplicity: time and again the howling Rupe got 
                    to his knees only to go down again as the earnest brothers, 
                    in their own way, assisted him to a more reclining position. 
                    Primal forces operated here, and the two blanched, slightly 
                    higher products of evolution, Sam and Penrod, no more thought 
                    of interfering than they would have thought of interfering 
                    with an earthquake.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">At last, out of the ruck rose 
                    Verman, disfigured and maniacal. With a wild eye he looked 
                    about him for his trusty rake; but Penrod, in horror, had 
                    long since thrown the rake out into the yard. Naturally, it 
                    had not seemed necessary to remove the lawn-mower.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">The frantic eye of Verman 
                    fell upon he lawn-mower, and instantly he leaped to its handle. 
                    Shrilling a wordless war-cry, he charged, propelling the whirling, 
                    deafening knives straight upon the prone legs of Rupe Collins. 
                    The lawn-mower was sincerely intended to pass longitudinally 
                    over the body of Mr. Collins from heel to head; and it was 
                    the time for a death-song. Black Valkyrie hovered in the shrieking 
                    air.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;Cut his gizzud out!&#148; 
                    shrieked Herman, urging on the whirling knives.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">They touched and lacerated 
                    the shin of Rupe as, with the supreme agony of effort a creature 
                    in mortal peril puts forth before succumbing, he tore himself 
                    free of Herman and got upon his feet. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Herman was up as quickly. 
                    He leaped to the wall and seized the garden-scythe that hung 
                    there.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;I&rsquo;m go&rsquo; to 
                    cut you gizzud out,&#148; he announced definitely, &#147;an&rsquo; 
                    eat it!&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Rupe Collins had never run 
                    from anybody (except his father) in his life; he was not a 
                    coward; but the present situation was very, very unusual. 
                    He was already in a badly dismantled condition, and yet Herman 
                    and Verman seemed discontented with their work: Verman was 
                    swinging the grass-cutter about for a new charge, apparently 
                    still wishing to mow him, and Herman had made a quite plausible 
                    statement about what he intended to do with the scythe. . 
                    . . </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Rupe paused but for an extremely 
                    condensed survey of the horrible advance of the brothers, 
                    and then, uttering a blood-curdled scream of fear, ran out 
                    of the stable and up the alley at a speed he had never before 
                    attained &hellip; . And a &lsquo;cross-shoulder glance at the 
                    corner, revealing Verman and Herman in pursuit, the latter 
                    waving his scythe overhead, Mr. Collins slackened not his 
                    gait &hellip; .</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">From the alley door, Penrod 
                    and Sam watched the flight, and were without words. When the 
                    pursuit rounded the corner, the two looked wanly at each other; 
                    but neither spoke until the return of the brothers back from 
                    the chase.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Herman and Verman came back, 
                    laughing and chuckling.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;Hiyi!&#148; cackled 
                    Herman to Verman, as they came. &#147;See &lsquo;at ole boy 
                    run!&#148;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;Who-ee!&#148; Verman 
                    shouted in ecstasy.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;Nev&rsquo; did se boy 
                    run so fas&rsquo;!&#148; Herman continued, tossing the scythe 
                    into the wheelbarrow. &#147;I bet he home in bed by viss time!&#148; 
                    &hellip; .</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Penrod looked dazedly from 
                    Herman to Verman and back again. So did Sam Williams.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">&#147;Herman,&#148; said Penrod, 
                    in a weak voice, &#147;you wouldn&rsquo;t <i>honest</i> of 
                    cut his gizzard out, would you?&#148;</font></p>
