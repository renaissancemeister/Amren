						<p>Just 44 percent of Los Angeles Unified students receive a high school diploma, making the 727,000-student district&rsquo;s graduation rate among the lowest of large urban school districts, a national study released Tuesday found. </p>
<p>Published by the nonpartisan publication Education Week with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the study adds more evidence to support claims that the district&rsquo;s graduation rate is at or below 50 percent. </p>
<p>District officials have repeatedly questioned the studies and say the graduation rate is closer to 64 percent. </p>
<p>The Education Week study found that the LAUSD&rsquo;s graduation rate was even lower than the 48 percent estimated by Harvard University in a controversial report that has been seized upon by those who want to break the district into smaller pieces. </p>
<p>The LAUSD was sixth from the bottom in graduation rates out of the nation&rsquo;s 50 largest school districts, trailed only by Detroit, Baltimore, New York City, Milwaukee and Cleveland. The study, which looked at U.S. Department of Education graduation rates for the 2002-03 school year, found California&rsquo;s graduation rate to be about 71 percent, slightly better than the nationwide average. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Superintendent Roy Romer said he was frustrated with the studies because they don&rsquo;t show the district&rsquo;s gains, don&rsquo;t take into account students who move during the year and exclude ninth-graders who are held back because they don&rsquo;t have enough units to move up. </p>
<p>The LAUSD reported a dropout rate of 33 percent to the state and officials maintain that new reports will show the figure has dropped to 24 percent &mdash; a nine percentage point drop in one year. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers said the results were not surprising for a large urban district with high poverty, a large number of minority students and where a quarter of the students are English learners. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O&rsquo;Connell said Tuesday that the report reflected what they&rsquo;ve known all along &mdash; that the state&rsquo;s dropout rate is too high, especially among Latino and African-American students. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study comes at the heels of another study released in April finding that barely half of LAUSD students receive their high school diplomas, mirroring the Harvard University study from a year ago that alarmed city officials and fueled debate over the district&rsquo;s effectiveness. </p>
<p>In the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research study, also funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the LAUSD ranked 86th out of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest school districts in its graduation rate &mdash; lower than districts in Alabama, Louisiana and Arkansas, which are historically under-performing states. </p>
<p>The results were even bleaker for the district&rsquo;s minority students. </p>
<p>Blacks had a 55 percent graduation rate and Latinos 44 percent, compared with 77 percent among whites and 80 percent among Asians. Latinos account for the overwhelming majority of LAUSD students. </p>

															City District Ranks Last In Graduations 
						</div>
										<p>
						<i> 
								Chastity Pratt, Detroit Free Press, July 21, 2006
							</i></font>
						</p>
										<p>
						<p>Fewer than one in four high school students in Detroit graduate on time, according to a new report released Tuesday that compares the 50 largest U.S. school districts and ranks the city&rsquo;s public schools last in the nation.</p>
<p>Only 21.7% of the Detroit district&rsquo;s students graduate in four years, the Diplomas Count report said. In it, the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center in Bethesda, Md., used a formula based on the number of students at the beginning of the year in each class &mdash; ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th &mdash; and the number of students who moved on to the next class the following year or graduated. The magazine Education Week published the report Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School officials said the report was based on a formula using data from the 2002-03 school year whereby researchers estimated the likelihood that a ninth-grader would complete high school in four years, earning a traditional diploma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our knowledge, they were not calculating graduation rates. They are really looking at probability rates, which is quite different,&rdquo; said Juanita Clay Chambers, the district&rsquo;s chief academic officer.</p>
<p>Even so, the report suggested Detroit&rsquo;s public schools are in much worse shape than other districts at the bottom of the rankings, including New York City, which has a 38.9% graduation rate. Fairfax County, Va., was at the top, with an 82.5% rate. By comparison, the report&rsquo;s methodology showed 70% of students graduating on time nationwide and 66% in Michigan.</p>
<p>Part of Detroit&rsquo;s problem, according to the report, is that it suffers from low parental involvement as students grow older and a high transitory rate that leads students to attend several schools before graduation. It also has a small but significant number of students who end up in alternative programs to get a GED.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may graduate, but they don&rsquo;t graduate from Detroit,&rdquo; said Tyrone Winfrey, a school board member and chair of the board&rsquo;s academic affairs committee.</p>
