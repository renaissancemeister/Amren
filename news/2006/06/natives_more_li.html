<h1>Natives More Likely To Be Murdered, Jailed: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CTV.ca, Jun. 6</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>OTTAWA &mdash; New statistics say native people are many times more likely to be murdered, jailed or the victims of crime. </p>
<p>Aboriginal people were seven times more likely to be murdered between 1997 and 2000 than non-natives, says a report Tuesday. </p>
<p>The study by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics says 40 per cent of aboriginals over age 15 reported being crime victims in the previous year, compared with a national average of 28 per cent. </p>
<p>Native people were twice as likely to be repeat victims, three times as likely to be robbed, assaulted or raped, and three and a half times more likely to be attacked by their spouse. </p>
<p>On reserves, the numbers were more grim &mdash; aboriginals were eight times more likely to be assaulted and seven times more likely to be sexually assaulted, compared with national averages. Only robbery was less often committed, at a rate of roughly half that for the rest of Canada. </p>
<p>Jodie-Anne Brzozowski, a senior analyst with the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, said aboriginal offenders share several traits that can help guide law and policy makers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Being young, having low education, having low incomes, having higher levels of unemployment, being a child raised by lone-parent families, higher rates of mobility and crowded (housing) conditions. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are all things that tend to raise the risk of anyone being a victim or offender. But they tend to be more common among the aboriginal population.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Native people serve an especially disproportionate amount of jail time. </p>
<p>Aboriginal adults make up just three per cent of the population but comprised 21 per cent of provincial inmates and 18 per cent of federal prisoners in 2003-04, says the study. </p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, aboriginals account for 10 per cent of the population but 80 per cent of those sent to provincial jails. </p>
<p>Young native people have a greater chance of landing behind bars than graduating from university, said Larry Chartrand, head of the aboriginal governance program at University of Winnipeg. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty stark. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they should rethink their failure to uphold the Kelowna Accord,&rdquo; he said of the Conservative government. </p>
<p>Indian Affairs Minister Jim Prentice says he supports the goals of improved living standards that underpinned the $5.1-billion agreement struck last November by the former Liberal government, native leaders and every premier. </p>
<p>But the Conservatives promised just $150 million this fiscal year and $300 million next year for such efforts. </p>
<p>Prentice says his government will commit more money and set its own course to fight native poverty. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are very sad numbers,&rdquo; he said Tuesday of the latest crime figures. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There were things discussed at Kelowna in terms of targets and objectives which I&rsquo;ve said are positive. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to do it with a Conservative plan to move forward.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Peter Dinsdale, executive director of the National Association of Friendship Centres, says there&rsquo;s no time to waste. </p>
<p>His group represents 117 front-line centres in cities across Canada. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stunning, the crimes we&rsquo;re doing against ourselves and how we&rsquo;re internalizing &hellip; oppression and the legacy of all this. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s years of us not graduating from high school, not being employed, not having access to the full benefits of Canadian society. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The violence is going to increase. We&rsquo;re starting to see some of these trends.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Kelowna didn&rsquo;t focus enough on native people living in cities but the accord was a rockbed for real commitment to change, Dinsdale said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s why events like Kelowna were so important from a First Nations perspective &mdash; to get to the roots of some of these homicides and sexual assaults.&rdquo; </p>
