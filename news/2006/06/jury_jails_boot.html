<h1>Jury Jails, Boots Cadet</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Poitras, Hartford Courant, June 29, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New London &mdash; After deliberating for four hours Wednesday, a military jury sentenced U.S. Coast Guard cadet Webster M. Smith to six months confinement and dismissed him from military service.</p>
<p>The sentence was handed down a day after the 23-year-old cadet was found guilty of sexually assaulting a female classmate last year and four other violations of the military code of conduct. It was the first court-martial of a cadet in the Coast Guard Academy&rsquo;s 130-year history.</p>
<p>Smith, of Houston, showed little emotion as Capt. Thomas Jones, president of the nine-officer jury panel, announced the sentence.</p>
<p>Earlier, members of Smith&rsquo;s family and his current girlfriend pleaded for leniency for the former academy football player, who could have been sentenced to more than 5Â½ years of incarceration.</p>
<p>Smith, in his own appeal to the court, apologized for the shame he has caused the academy, and also apologized to his family, fellow cadets and friends who &ldquo;believed in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that I do not deserve to graduate,&rdquo; he said, fighting back tears. &ldquo;No matter what you decide, my career here is over. &hellip; The fact that I am here today shows that I have failed. I should have been a better leader, cadet and friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to six months confinement, the jury also ordered Smith to forfeit all military pay, stipends and benefits he has acquired over the past four years as a cadet. Smith&rsquo;s dismissal from service equates to a dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p>Smith was found guilty of indecent sexual assault of a cadet, performing oral sex on a cadet in violation of military conduct codes, using the threat of blackmail to coerce a cadet into having sex, being absent from his watch in a cadet dormitory and attempting to disobey an order. He was acquitted of charges of raping his former girlfriend, also a cadet, and other offenses involving two other female cadets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s sentencing followed emotional appeals from Smith&rsquo;s mother, father and girlfriend. They testified that Smith is a changed man who will forever carry the stigma of a federal sex assault conviction and has learned from his mistakes. He will have to register as a sex offender upon his release.</p>
<p>Smith could have been sentenced to up to five years and seven months incarceration, dishonorable discharge from the Coast Guard and forfeiture of all his military pay, stipends and benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The guilty verdicts for indecent assault, sodomy and extortion all relate to Smith&rsquo;s conduct with a female cadet, now an ensign, who alleged that Smith had come to her room on three occasions the night of Oct. 19, 2005.</p>
<p>The visits progressed from taking nude photographs to massages to oral sex.</p>
<p>The woman claimed Smith took advantage of her after she confided in him about a secret that could have jeopardized her military career.</p>

						<p>New London, Conn. &mdash; A Coast Guard cadet accused of rape and other sex offenses was a manipulative senior who preyed on lonely women, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening arguments at the defendant&rsquo;s court-martial.</p>
<p>Webster Smith, 22, of Houston pleaded not guilty Monday in the first student court-martial in Coast Guard Academy history to charges including rape, sodomy, extortion and assault that stem from allegations by three female cadets.</p>
<p>His military attorney compared the case to the Salem witch trials, in which people were put to death based on concocted stories that weren&rsquo;t backed up by evidence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his opening statement, Bald described Smith as a manipulative person who preyed on women when they were weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they were drunk and alone he moved in. When they were helpless, he moved in. When they had nowhere left to turn, he moved in,&rdquo; Bald said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The jury of Coast Guard officers includes four white men, one white woman, three black men and a man of Asian descent.</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s attorneys, who raised the possibility that the charges could be racially motivated, said they were pleased by the jury&rsquo;s diversity. Smith is black and the accusers are white.</p>
