<h1>Mugabe: Zimbabwe Doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Need Rescuing&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, June 29, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harare, Zimbabwe &mdash; President Robert Mugabe on Thursday rejected international mediation in Zimbabwe&rsquo;s political crisis, saying the southern African state was not on the verge of collapse although its economy was in trouble.</p>
<p>Critics accuse Mugabe of running down one of Africa&rsquo;s most promising countries, abusing human rights and hanging onto power by rigging votes in the face of a deepening economic crisis.</p>
<p>Speaking at the funeral of one of his ministers, Mugabe &mdash; under pressure from domestic and Western critics to accept U.N. mediation in a crisis largely blamed on his government &mdash; said Zimbabweans were ready to die fighting for their political rights and would never accept subjugation.</p>
<p>Mugabe, 82, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s sole ruler since independence in 1980, accused former colonial power Britain and the United States of mobilizing &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; Western economic sanctions against his government over its seizures of white-owned commercial farms for landless blacks.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is struggling with the world&rsquo;s highest inflation rate of nearly 1,200 percent and the World Bank says the country has the fastest shrinking economy outside a war zone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an apparent reply to suggestions that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan must step in to help, the combative Zimbabwean leader said on Thursday there was no political crisis in the country requiring foreign mediation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lately, we have heard about so-called &lsquo;initiatives&rsquo; to rescue Zimbabwe. We don&rsquo;t need rescuing because we are not about to die,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Zimbabwe needs is a just and lawful treatment by the Western world, a recognition that it is a full, sovereign country which has the right to own and control its resources, the right to chart its own destiny unhindered,&rdquo; he said.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54059">Zimbabwe: A Downgrade In Country&rsquo;s Status Causes Friction</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Irinnews.org, June 20, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Johannesburg &mdash; A furore has erupted over a UN committee&rsquo;s recommendation to rank Zimbabwe as a least-developed country (LDC).</p>
<p>Zimbabwean officials were furious at the UN Committee for Development Policy&rsquo;s findings that Zimbabwe, along with Papua New Guinea, was eligible for inclusion in the list of 50 LDCs. The committee said Zimbabwe had not only remained a low-income country for a protracted period, but had also become more economically vulnerable.</p>
<p>In assessing a country&rsquo;s economic vulnerability, the committee among other factors considers food security, instability of exports of good and services and share of agriculture in the country&rsquo;s income.</p>
<p>Government spokesman George Charamba was quoted in the Sunday edition of the Daily Chronicle as dismissing the committee&rsquo;s findings. &ldquo;They want to create [an impression] that the country has failed. Our position remains the same that we are not beggars. We are not a poor country and we want to be rated accordingly. We need the correct position that we deserve&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He maintained the country&rsquo;s problems were a result of &ldquo;illegal sanctions&rdquo; imposed by western nations. The government&rsquo;s rejection of the findings means the country cannot be included in the official table of LDCs.</p>
<p>According to some UN officials, the issue of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s classification has become &ldquo;highly politicised&rdquo;, with the government on the one hand alleging a plot to denigrate the country, and humanitarian workers arguing the authorities should face the reality of the unfolding crisis.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean economist Professor Tony Hawkins said the UN committee had taken &ldquo;objective criteria&rdquo; into consideration. He pointed out that over the past two decades, Zimbabwe had slipped from a middle-income country to a low-income one as a result of government policies. &ldquo;And now to be put in the LDC category is embarrassing for the government&rdquo;.</p>
<p>According to Diana Games, a researcher with the South African Institute for International Affairs (SAIIA), Zimbabwe has experienced a more than 30 percent drop in its Gross Domestic Product in the past four years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has gone from being one of the most successful economies on the continent to a country plagued by food shortages, reduced industrial capacity, declining exports and massive unemployment &hellip; Factory output has fallen [by] 45.6 percent since 1998, and manufacturing levels are at their lowest since 1971&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Besides economic vulnerability, the UN committee also assesses health, nutrition, poverty levels and education, while drawing up its list of LDCs.</p>
