<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>How you view the recent news about a Santa Ana man who pleaded guilty to selling cars from his house may depend on which side of South Broadway you live on.</p>
<p>On the east side, Tim Rush says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;ecstatic, and doing a jig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more than a year, Rush had regularly complained to city officials about problem neighbors, particularly Pedro Reyes Rios, whom he nicknamed the &ldquo;Cal Worthington of South Broadway.&rdquo; Reyes was selling cars parked on the street and in his yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s home is his castle,&rdquo; said Rush, 51. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have to be infringed upon by people selling cars, refrigerators and corn on the cob, plus people playing ranchera music at all hours of the day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On the west side of South Broadway, Reyes and other residents are annoyed with Rush and his stream of complaints, which some view as racially motivated. Some see him as a meddler, an outsider who complains about people and customs he doesn&rsquo;t understand. One neighbor wonders if he&rsquo;s just lonely. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conflict between Rush and most of his neighbors goes beyond the bootleg car lot. Rush has filed a string of complaints to the city &mdash; 300 telephone calls in 24 months &mdash; about abandoned cars, illegal additions, garage conversions and music being played too loudly. </p>
<p>He says he&rsquo;s not motivated by his neighbors&rsquo; ethnicity but by a desire to improve his neighborhood and raise property values.</p>
<p>Neighbors in the Wilshire Square Neighborhood Assn., who know Rush because of his long community involvement, applaud his efforts on South Broadway.</p>
<p>Rush &ldquo;has every right to go after anything that will make that a better street,&rdquo; said Evangeline Gawronski, a community activist who lives three blocks from Rush. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to make sure that people abide by the law so everyone can live comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At City Hall, Rush has received acclaim for his persistence. Officials say they need more vigilance by residents, because inspectors are spread thin.</p>
<p>Rush &ldquo;got my cellphone number and kept calling me,&rdquo; said Bruce Dunhams, the city&rsquo;s lead code enforcement official. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s passionate about the city, and I know he&rsquo;s trying to do something to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But most of Rush&rsquo;s neighbors are less than understanding about his campaign.</p>
<p>Jorge Mendez, a gardener who lives three doors away, sums up the feelings of many of his neighbors.</p>
<p>Rush is &ldquo;watching us all the time. Before he came, no one here had any problems,&rdquo; Mendez said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why he is like this. Is it because we are Latinos or what? </p>
<p>Kathi Lapworth, one of the few white residents in the neighborhood, said Rush didn&rsquo;t understand that this section of Santa Ana would never look like Irvine, a master-planned community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike him, but he just doesn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one guy living in a house, and he doesn&rsquo;t seem to get the fact that there are houses here with more than one family living in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That changes a lot of things about parking and the way a neighborhood is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as seasoned as I am, I was, and am, overwhelmed,&rdquo; Rush says of the code violations on South Broadway.</p>
<p>Often, he would call police about noise late at night, as he stood on his porch having a cigar and a glass of Johnnie Walker Black Label.</p>
<p>Rush called about four inoperable vehicles in a backyard abutting his yard. The city contacted an out-of-town homeowner, who arrived from Texas and removed them. </p>
<p>Rush objected to graffiti on the walls of a garage that he could see from his back porch, and the owners were forced to paint it over. </p>
<p>He called animal control officials about a barking dog. After more than a dozen calls, the barking stopped.</p>
<p>He told code enforcement officials that a neighbor had illegally built a driveway in the frontyard, and city officials required the neighbor to replace the lawn.</p>
<p>More than two dozen times, he reported to police loud music playing at 8 a.m. on Sundays at a house three doors away. The music has stopped.</p>
<p>And time and time again, he complained about Reyes, who could be seen from Rush&rsquo;s living room showing cars parked on the streets to buyers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, for many in the neighborhood, Rush is a curiosity. They can&rsquo;t figure out why he lives alone in a house or why he flies a U.S. flag on a street where many people aren&rsquo;t even U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Lorena Mendez, a mother of two toddlers who lives with four other family members, imagines Rush is distraught &mdash; not over loud music and illegal additions, but over being alone. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He feels bitter about his own life,&rdquo; she hypothesized. &ldquo;He is trying to reach out, to connect with other people, even though he&rsquo;s doing it in a strange way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Rush, the recent victory over the used-car lot was a signal to continue his mission. He wants to report cases of graffiti, overcrowded apartments and illegal parking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reyes, a cook, sees it differently. &ldquo;No one likes him here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He wants to change Santa Ana. He bought a house here. That doesn&rsquo;t give him the right to boss people around and tell them how to live.&rdquo; <br>
