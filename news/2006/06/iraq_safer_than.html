<h1>Iraq: Safer Than D.C.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Walden, FrontPage Magazine, June 1, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Iraqi civilian death statistics compiled by Rep. Steve King, R-IA, indicate that, contrary to the impression made on the evening news, Iraq actually has a lower civilian violent death rate than Washington, D.C., and pre-Katrina New Orleans. Iraq is also substantially safer than several foreign countries. After seeing media coverage of Iraqi violence King said: &#147;I began to ask myself the question, if you were a civilian in Iraq, how could you tolerate that level of violence. What really is the level of violence?&#148; </p>
<p>King calculates an annualized Iraqi civilian death rate of 27.5 per 100,000 based on U.S. military and independent statistical sources. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>As American leftists pretend to decry violence in Iraq, they celebrate the rise of Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. Pro-surrender activist Cindy Sheehan appeared with Chavez <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10704025">January 29</a>. On the stage at the &#147;World Social Forum&#148; in Caracas, Sheehan noted that singer and activist Harry Belafonte recently called Bush &#147;the greatest terrorist in the world,&#148; and said, &#147;I agree with him. George Bush is responsible for killing tens of thousands of innocent people.&#148; Chavez encouraged Sheehan to run for President of the U.S. and he announced that Sheehan would again be protesting in Crawford, TX.</p>
<p>Ironically, Venezuela has 31.5 violent deaths per 100,000&mdash;14.5 percent higher than Iraq. It is Chavez who is responsible for &#147;killing tens of thousands of innocent people.&#148; <a href="http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/news/world/14396608.htm">The son of a recent Venezuelan murder victim explains</a>, &#147;The president is always saying it&rsquo;s OK to steal in order to eat.&#148; </p>
<p>Chavez often provides justification for violence in his speeches: &#147;The rich are condemned to Hell. Christ himself condemned them. I say it from the heart: to be rich is evil.&#148;</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s hand-wringing &lsquo;humanitarians&rsquo; should demand that Chavez make Venezuela as safe as President Bush has made Iraq&mdash;or face impeachment by the Venezuelan Congress.</p>
<p>Venezuela is not alone in suffering at the hands of left-wing dictators or wannabe dictators: Columbia, hounded by leftist narco-guerrillas, every year looses 61.7 of its citizens to violence per every 100,000.</p>
<p>South Africa, led by an increasingly corrupt African National Congress looses 49.6 per 100,000 to violent deaths every year. In Jamaica&mdash;ruled for decades by the socialist People&rsquo;s National Party&mdash;it is 32.4.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But high murder rates are not limited to overseas leftist-ruled countries. In the American urban centers&mdash;where African-American loyalty to leftist Democrat politicians is &lsquo;rewarded&rsquo; with dependency creating social programs&mdash;levels of violence top Iraq and Venezuela.</p>
<p>In Washington, D.C., it is 45.9 violent deaths per 100,000. This means civilians living in Washington D.C.&mdash;home to many leftist operatives who spend all day scheming to undermine President Bush&rsquo;s efforts in Iraq&mdash;are 63.5 percent less safe than Iraqi civilians. </p>
<p>Other American cities with higher violent civilian death rates than Iraq include: </p>
<ul>
<p><li>Detroit: 41.8 per 100,000 </li></p></ul>
<ul>
<p><li>Baltimore: 37.7 per 100,000 </li></p></ul>
<ul>
<p><li>Atlanta: 34.9 per 100,000 </li></p></ul>
<ul>
<p><li>St. Louis: 31.4 per 100,000</li></p></ul>
<p>They are all overwhelmingly Democratic.</p>
<p>The American city with the highest civilian death rate was New Orleans before Katrina&mdash;with a staggering 53.1 deaths per 100,000&mdash;almost twice the death rate in Iraq. With no sense of irony, corrupt Louisiana Democrats blame Bush for the Katrina disaster. </p>
