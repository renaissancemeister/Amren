						<p>A schism over anti-Semitism threatens a key &lsquo;white nationalist&rsquo; group. The outcome could be critical to the radical right.</p>
<p>Herndon, Va. &mdash; For a gathering of people devoted to denouncing the inferiority of blacks and sounding the alarm about civilization-threatening Muslims, the biannual conferences thrown by the New Century Foundation, publisher of the racist newsletter <em>American Renaissance,</em> are decidedly genteel affairs. Men dress in suits and ties, women in formal business attire, and there are no uniformed skinheads or Klansmen to be seen. Large plasma television screens, Starbucks coffee spreads and fancy linens adorn the hotel meeting hall. Epithets have no place here.</p>
<p>Or at least they didn&rsquo;t. At the latest edition of the conferences that began in 1994, held this February at the Hyatt Dulles hotel, a nasty spat broke out that upset the gathering&rsquo;s decorum &mdash; and may even shape the future of the radical right.</p>
<p>It began when David Duke, the former Klan leader and author of <em>Jewish Supremacism,</em> strode to a microphone after French author Guillaume Faye wrapped up a talk vilifying Muslims entitled &ldquo;The Threat to the West.&rdquo; Duke thanked Faye for remarks that &ldquo;touched my genes.&rdquo; But then he went one further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a power in the world that dominates our media, influences our government and that has led to the internal destruction of our will and spirit,&rdquo; Duke said, according to an undisputed account in <em>The Forward </em>newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, tell us,&rdquo; someone in the back yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say it,&rdquo; Duke replied. Laughter began to fill the room, until a short, angry man leaped from his seat, walked up to Duke and began to curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fucking Nazi, you&rsquo;ve disgraced this meeting!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And with that, Michael Hart, a Jewish astrophysicist and long-time attendee at <em>American Renaissance </em>conferences, headed for the door. As many as 50 people at the conference began to jeer and point at the rapidly disappearing Hart.</p>
<p>This extraordinary incident marked the beginning of an open rift between those on the radical right who see blacks, Hispanics and Muslims as the primary enemy, and those who say &ldquo;the Jews&rdquo; are ultimately behind every evil &mdash; a split that has usually stayed just below the surface but now threatens a leading institution of American extremism. While in the past he has managed to bridge this divide mainly by ignoring it, <em>American Renaissance </em>founder Jared Taylor now must finally come to terms with the split. His dilemma boils down to this: Throw out the anti-Semites and try to build a larger movement with electoral possibilities like those increasingly seen in Britain and Germany; or openly join hands with the very energetic neo-Nazis even though that means the loss of any remaining shred of respectability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the makings of a major schism,&rdquo; wrote Shawn Mercer, co-founder and moderator of <em>American Renaissance</em>&rsquo;s AR List, an E-mail group. &ldquo;If <em>American Renaissance </em>ultimately fails as a result of this donnybrook at the convention, it will be a sad, possibly fatal turn of events for the future of whites.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Jews and the Radical Right</strong></p>
<p>The traditional enemy of the American radical right, going back to the Civil War and even before, has been the black man. Given the numbers of voters who would be created by enfranchising former slaves &mdash; and the historical fact that blacks outnumbered whites in many southern counties &mdash; that is no surprise. But radical anger also has been directed throughout U.S. history at each new wave of foreign immigrants, and, in both the 19th century and the 20th, that included Jews.</p>
<p>European anti-Semitism made its way across the ocean as well, infecting Americans with ideas about secret Jewish plans for world domination and alleged ritual practices like the murder of Christian children. Increasingly, hatred of Jews filtered into groups like the Klan &mdash; most famously, in 1915, when the group was reborn on the strength of the lynching of Jewish businessman Leo Frank of Atlanta. (Frank was falsely accused of the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl.)</p>
<p>In the 1920s, auto tycoon Henry Ford published anti-Semitic treatises culminating in the book, <em>The International Jew.</em> In the following decade, Father Charles Coughlin, a radical Catholic, railed against Jews in radio broadcasts heard by millions. There followed a brief lull in anti-Semitism due to revelations about the Nazi genocide, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before Jew-hatred came roaring back.</p>
<p>This was partly due to the spread of Christian Identity, a radical theology that claims that Jews are biologically descended from Satan and are the chief enemy of the white man. This ideology, which increasingly crept into traditionally Christian groups like the Klan, helped to start the broad-based change that has occurred over the last half century or so &mdash; the Nazification of the American radical right. Growing anti-Semitism also reflected the view of many segregationists that Jews were behind the black civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The bombings of several Southern synagogues by white supremacists underlined this conviction.</p>
<p>In recent decades, however, mainstream American society has rejected anti-Semitism, to the point where it is generally seen as more acceptable to voice ugly views of blacks than Jews. And this has not been lost on certain sectors of the radical right that have become increasingly interested in gaining real political power. Given recent developments in the United States &mdash; especially large-scale Latin American immigration and the threat of radical Islamist terror &mdash; these sectors have wondered if it wasn&rsquo;t better to direct their hate at people of color, rather than Jews who are seen by most Americans as white. Seeing the electoral success of neofascists in Germany and Britain who aim their wrath at dark-skinned immigrants and Muslims generally, many American radical leaders have sought to dispense with anti-Semitism.</p>
<p><strong>Black Attack</strong></p>
<p>In 1990, Jared Taylor, a Yale graduate who had spent 17 years working in Japan, joined the active white supremacist scene with his launching of <em>American Renaissance,</em> a magazine focusing on the alleged links between race and intelligence and on eugenics, the discredited &ldquo;science&rdquo; of breeding better human beings. The magazine scrupulously avoided racist epithets, employed the language of academic journals, and sought to put a palatable face on hate (though that didn&rsquo;t stop Taylor from describing blacks as &ldquo;deviant,&rdquo; dissipated&rdquo; and &ldquo;pathological,&rdquo; or later writing a booklet that claimed that blacks are far more &ldquo;crime-prone&rdquo; than whites).</p>
<p>At the same time, Taylor made it clear that he had no problem with Jews. At the group&rsquo;s very first conference, held in Atlanta in 1994, the dinner speaker was a rabbi named Mayer Schiller, and the meal was kosher. Taylor banned discussion of the so-called &ldquo;Jewish question&rdquo; from <em>American Renaissance </em>venues, and, by 1997, had kicked Holocaust deniers and neo-Nazis off his E-mail list. In recent years, a growing number of Jews have attended Taylor&rsquo;s conferences.</p>
<p>But Taylor, who operates in a world that is peopled with anti-Semites as well as black-bashing &ldquo;white nationalists,&rdquo; also tried to have it both ways.</p>
<p>Atlanta lawyer Sam Dickson, for instance, has been invited to speak at every one of Taylor&rsquo;s biannual conferences &mdash; despite a long history of Holocaust denial that includes membership on the editorial board of <em>The Barnes Review,</em> a journal that specializes in that topic. Joe Sobran, a columnist fired from the <em>National Review </em>for his anti-Semitism and repeat author for the Holocaust-denying <em>Journal of Historical Review,</em> gave a speech on Jewish power at Taylor&rsquo;s 2004 conference. Don Black, the former Klan leader who runs the neo-Nazi Stormfront web forum, has attended many conferences and visited Taylor&rsquo;s home. Another attendee and old Taylor pal, Mark Weber, heads up the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review.</p>
<p>Taylor, whose journal and conferences were fast becoming key institutions of the American radical right, tried to keep internal peace. But that was not to be.</p>
<p>In 2003, a remarkable E-mail debate between the late racist writer Sam Francis and neo-Nazi lawyer Victor Gerhard was made public by Gerhard. In it, Francis, widely regarded as the leading white nationalist intellectual in America, lambasted Gerhard, who had been an official of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, for his views of the Jews. He denounced what he saw as &ldquo;a monomaniacal obsession with the omnipotent Jew&rdquo; and instead discussed the threat of blacks and Hispanics. The E-mail exchange was widely circulated on the American radical right.</p>
<p>The same period saw several groups &mdash; the Social Contract Press, the Charles Martel Society (publisher of <em>The Occidental Quarterly</em>), the Pioneer Fund, the Council of Conservative Citizens and the recently formed National Policy Institute &mdash; focus in on the perceived ills of blacks, Hispanics and Muslims. Joining them was a new crop of racist intellectuals with no interest in the Jews.</p>
<p>Taylor, it seemed, could not stop the inevitable. The split between those who saw Jews as the primary enemy and the others was bubbling to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Battle of Words</strong></p>
<p>The biggest threat to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s balancing act has always been David Duke, the former leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan who has also been a convinced neo-Nazi since his teens. Duke, who came close to winning a campaign for Louisiana governor in 1992, was for years a celebrity on the radical right. Still, Taylor has sought to discourage Duke from attending his <em>American Renaissance </em>conferences ever since Duke crashed the first one in 1994. But even in years when he didn&rsquo;t enter the hall, Duke was often found outside, talking to participants.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Duke, either. Over the years, more and more participants at Taylor&rsquo;s conferences were Duke allies &mdash; most notably, Don Black and supporters of Black&rsquo;s Stormfront website, including Stormfront moderator Jamie Kelso.</p>
<p>This year, the Duke/Black/Kelso crew was larger than ever. In an interview with the <em>Intelligence Report,</em> Kelso said that he had organized a contingent of some 75 Stormfront supporters to come to the conference. And these supporters were the most enthusiastic members of the 300-strong audience, standing and applauding each speaker after receiving the signal to do so from Kelso. They were also not the only anti-Semites present. Others, not affiliated with Stormfront, included Kevin Alfred Strom of Virginia, leader of the neo-Nazi National Vanguard group; Hal Turner, a neo-Nazi radio host from New Jersey; and David Pringle of Alaska, the former membership coordinator of the neo-Nazi National Alliance.</p>
<p>As a result, the Duke-Hart clash, which occurred on the last day of the conference, rapidly assumed epic proportions, spinning out across the entire radical right. Just days later, Duke published an essay on the conference, expressing deep admiration for Taylor as a man with the courage to tell the truth on race. But he went on to say that non-white immigration and a host of other ills &ldquo;all have been driven by Jewish extremists in their relentless search for supremacy.&rdquo; Hart, Duke added tartly, had risen &ldquo;in an almost perfect Jewish caricature and started to scream at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That set off an often testy back-and-forth between the two sides.</p>
<p>From London, Nick Griffin, a conference speaker who also heads the whites-only British National Party, denounced those who see behind every evil some kind of &ldquo;world-Jewish conspiracy.&rdquo; Griffin&rsquo;s BNP, which harshly attacks Muslims and other British minorities, made major electoral gains this May &mdash; a success that Griffin thinks would be undermined by neo-Nazi attacks on Jews. In his essay, Griffin suggested that Jews are a natural ally in the battle against Islam.</p>
<p>Black, on the other hand, threatened to pull his anti-Semitic supporters out of Taylor&rsquo;s conferences. &ldquo;I guess that would solve the overcrowding problem,&rdquo; Black wrote. &ldquo;Not only would he cut loose the &hellip; Stormfronters, but, should he apply such an ideological filter [barring anti-Semites], about 90% of his other attendees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence Auster, a former <em>American Renaissance </em>speaker who also is a Christian convert with Jewish ancestry, chimed in on his own blog, describing Duke as &ldquo;a major Jew-hater and an attention hog&rdquo; and asking Taylor how he could be so &ldquo;naïve as to allow Duke to attend at all.&rdquo; Another poster to Auster&rsquo;s site added, &ldquo;It is imperative that neo-Nazis be asked to leave AR&hellip; .   European-Americans need to be assured they can affirm themselves and still be decent human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, nearly every &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; on the white nationalist scene was pulled into the debate. So hot was the months-long exchange, in fact, that more than half a dozen major racist thinkers agreed to speak to the <em>Intelligence Report.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rejecting the Nazis</strong></p>
<p>Virtually all those who denounced anti-Semitism and &ldquo;Nazis&rdquo; had no such compunctions when it came to people of color, particularly blacks. Herschel Elias, for instance, told the <em>Intelligence Report</em> that as a Jewish substitute teacher in public schools near Philadelphia, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very disappointed with black people. Black kids are the worst kids.&rdquo; But he added that he now saw the conference as a &ldquo;Nazi front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Jew, retired University of Illinois political science professor Robert Weissberg, was a long-time supporter of <em>American Renaissance </em>who spoke at two conferences. In 2000, he argued that Jews and blacks despise one another, but that Jews are even more afraid of white nationalists and so had tended to support policies that empower minorities. Weissberg told the Report that he considered Taylor a friend and had been to his house &ldquo;on several occasions.&rdquo; But he went on to say that Duke was a &ldquo;tax evader&rdquo; (Duke recently served time in federal prison for mail fraud and tax violations) and &ldquo;provocateur,&rdquo; and that his Stormfront allies were &ldquo;losers.&rdquo; He said that both Duke and the Stormfronters should be &ldquo;disinvited&rdquo; by Taylor.</p>
<p>The list goes on. In separate interviews with the <em>Intelligence Report,</em> numerous &ldquo;academic racists&rdquo; complained of the neo-Nazi element at the conference.</p>
<p>• Michael Levin, a Jewish philosophy professor at the City University of New York who has spoken four times at <em>American Renaissance </em>conferences, said that there was &ldquo;anti-Semitism among members of AR&rdquo; and that this was part of the reason he did not attend the 2006 edition. (However, Levin still plugs his black-bashing book, Race Matters, in ads in American Renaissance.)</p>
<p>• Paul Gottfried, a humanities professor with Jewish ancestry at Elizabethtown (Penn.) College, spoke to the conference in 1998 and has published in <em>American Renaissance.</em> But he said he is dismayed at the current situation. &ldquo;I cannot imagine any advantage to anyone to have these people there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>• William Regnery, the extreme-right publisher who also founded and financially backs the Charles Martel Society and the National Policy Institute, dismissed Duke&rsquo;s anti-Semitism, saying simply, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t sanction it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>• Gordon Baum, the St. Louis-based CEO of the racist Council of Conservative Citizens, has Taylor on his editorial board and fights to preserve the &ldquo;racial integrity&rdquo; of white people. But, he said, the CCC welcomes Jews. And, adding that the CCC has no interest in &ldquo;skinheads,&rdquo; Baum rapped Duke for believing that &ldquo;race isn&rsquo;t even important, all that is important is the Jewish issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>• Baum&rsquo;s new editor for the CCC&rsquo;s publication, <em>Citizens Informer,</em> seconded his boss&rsquo; opinions. &ldquo;Attacking people with Jewish lines of descent is complete nonsense,&rdquo; Joel LeFevre told the Report, adding that he was &ldquo;very put off by Mr. Duke&rsquo;s behavior&rdquo; at the conference. Separately, LeFevre wrote on the AR List that Duke and his &ldquo;puerile loser&rdquo; followers should be banned. &ldquo;Duke has his own conference where he can rant about the Jews all he wants,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>• Jared Taylor, too, spoke to the Report, saying, &ldquo;European Jews are certainly welcome&rdquo; at <em>American Renaissance </em>conferences. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that Jews are the enemy in the way that some people do.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, Taylor came out against Nazism as early as 1983, in his book, <em>Shadows of the Rising Sun: A Critical View of the &lsquo;Japanese Miracle&rsquo;,</em> where Germany was praised for outlawing national socialism. In addition, Jews write regularly in <em>American Renaissance </em>and have spoken at every one of its conferences.</p>
<p><strong>At the Crossroads</strong></p>
<p>Two months after the conference, on April 14, Jared Taylor went public. Responding to a letter from a group of supporters including several Jews, he posted a statement to his website that seemed to take clear sides. Under the title, &ldquo;Jews and <em>American Renaissance</em>,&rdquo; Taylor said that Jews &ldquo;have a valuable role&rdquo; to play, and told those who didn&rsquo;t agree that they had the choice of &ldquo;staying home&rdquo; or of keeping their anti-Semitism private. He wrote that <em>American Renaissance</em>&rsquo;s role is to rescue white civilization, not dig up a &ldquo;Jewish conspiracy.&rdquo; And Taylor explicitly rebuked Duke, saying his &ldquo;disgraceful behavior&rdquo; would not be tolerated in the future.</p>
<p>Within 48 hours, Taylor&rsquo;s statement had generated 168 responses. Two days later, there were more than 300. The reaction from anti-Semites was harsh, with many claiming that their erstwhile ally was actually in the pay of &ldquo;the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cal Rogers, an <em>American Renaissance </em>staffer who headed up an E-mail list of Taylor critics, quit the group, saying he was &ldquo;diametrically opposed&rdquo; to Taylor&rsquo;s views. Jess David Peterson wrote in to say that Taylor&rsquo;s writings had been removed from Peterson&rsquo;s Nationalist Party USA website. On Stormfront, Elena Haskins, a hate website proprietress, scoffed at those &ldquo;who require their friend the rabbi to pat them on their heads and tushies.&rdquo; Ron Doggett, a Duke factotum, suggested Taylor was unfortunately sending America&rsquo;s anti-Semites packing. Don Black called Taylor&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;disastrous.&rdquo; Another neo-Nazi said it was &ldquo;a devastating miscalculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, Taylor was being lobbied by Jews and others who argued that the only way forward for <em>American Renaissance </em>was to drop those with neo-Nazi leanings entirely. Members of this group included many of the brighter minds &mdash; or better educated ones, anyway &mdash; that have come into the white nationalist world in recent years, and their relative prestige would be hard for Taylor to give up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear how the situation will wind up. Taylor has now publicly rejected anti-Semitic views, but he hasn&rsquo;t banned anti-Semites from his conferences.</p>
<p>What is certain is that it will be painful for Taylor to definitively eject the anti-Semites &mdash; Duke, Black and their neo-Nazi allies are among the most committed and serious workers in the American radical right, people who have arguably done far more for &ldquo;the movement&rdquo; than all the racist professors who travel to <em>American Renaissance </em>conferences put together. But he seems to be personally uninterested in conspiracy theories about the Jews, and in any case sees clearly that anti-Semitism will likely destroy any faint hope that <em>American Renaissance </em>has to gain mainstream respectability. Taylor could try to pursue a middle road &mdash; espousing, for instance, the anti-Semitic teachings of Kevin MacDonald, which avoid neo-Nazi language in favor of the academic veneer of &ldquo;evolutionary biology.&rdquo; Or he could break with the neo-Nazis and their allies, even though Taylor is connected to many of them through dense ties of friendship and organizational alliances.</p>
<p>The outcome may be critical to the future of the American radical right. <em>American Renaissance</em> has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy. Today, it may be the closest thing the extreme right has to a real think tank. Whether or not it survives, and in what form, genuinely matters.</p>

															<h2>The New Racialists</h2>
											<p>
							<i>SPLC Intelligence Report, Summer 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A fresh crop of &lsquo;intellectuals&rsquo; joins the radical right.</p>
<p>With the February 2005 death of columnist and Council of Conservative Citizens editor Sam Francis, the radical right lost its most important thinker. But little more than a year after Francis&rsquo; death, a whole group of &ldquo;academic racists&rdquo; is being cultivated by some of the country&rsquo;s leading extremist groups. That is no surprise &mdash; white supremacists have spoken frequently of the need to rejuvenate the ranks of their intellectuals. Francis told his acolyte, Joel LeFevre, that &ldquo;the next generation has to step up to the plate and begin assuming responsibility for the future of this movement.&rdquo; Jared Taylor, who edits the racist journal <em>American Renaissance, </em>agreed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want something to be so full of old dopes that it disappears or dies,&rdquo; he told the <em>Intelligence Report.</em> The eight men profiled below are not all youngsters, but they are new blood for academic racism.</p>
<p><strong>Louis R. Andrews, 63</strong><br>
Augusta, Ga.</p>
<p>An acolyte of racist publisher William H. Regnery, Louis Andrews has become increasingly important in academic racist circles in recent years. Going back to the 1990s, Andrews has run a website called &ldquo;Stalking the Wild Taboo&rdquo; meant &ldquo;for sociopolitical thinkers unfettered by submission to the power of the pejorative,&rdquo; by which Andrews means for those unafraid of being called racist. More recently, Andrews, a graduate of the College of Charleston who did some graduate work in history at the University of South Carolina, was named managing editor of <em>The Occidental Quarterly,</em> a racist journal published by Regnery&rsquo;s Charles Martel Society, and a director of the National Policy Institute, another hate group that was started recently by Regnery. Andrews has written widely on such matters as race and intelligence, but he also publishes large amounts of work from likeminded allies. Through his company L.R. Andrews, Inc. (www.lrainc.com), he runs Washington Summit Publishers, which reprints a range of classical and modern racist tracts, along with books on eugenics, the discredited &ldquo;science&rdquo; of breeding better humans. Washington Summit also sells the works of Kevin MacDonald, which Andrews says show why &ldquo;anti-Semitism is a naturally expected and powerful phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Boor, 29</strong><br>
St. Louis, Mo.</p>
<p>A long-time admirer of Sam Francis, Anthony Boor edits several sections of the <em>Citizens Informer,</em> the newsletter of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens that Francis ran until his death in 2005. Boor and his wife Diana are highly active in the CCC chapter in St. Louis, where CCC boss Gordon Baum lives, joining in rallies and numerous other events and, in 2005, the CCC&rsquo;s board of directors. He also runs a CCC E-list, Citizens Council News Update. In a 2003 CCC symposium on reparations for slavery, Boor called that idea &ldquo;a gargantuan hustle,&rdquo; &ldquo;nothing more than opaque sucker bait in order to lure whitey and his government into filling their [blacks&rsquo;] pockets so they can live high off the hog for decades to come.&rdquo; He also rejected the idea of a breakup of the country into racial mini-states because, he said, it would be tantamount to &ldquo;decline and retreat,&rdquo; whereas whites should instead be pushing for ways &ldquo;that non-white America could become white, or at least livable for whites.&rdquo; Boor, who won a special CCC &ldquo;membership award&rdquo; in 2004, remains enamored of Sam Francis, a writer whom he regularly refers to as &ldquo;The Bard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Ian Jobling, 36</strong><br>
Fairfax, Va.</p>
<p>With a 2001 Ph.D. in literature from the State University of New York, Ian Jobling is the website editor for <em>American Renaissance,</em> the racist journal run by Jared Taylor and his New Century Foundation. His early interests included Darwinian literary criticism, such as the article he wrote arguing that the Sir Walter Scott classic, <em>Ivanhoe,</em> was actually about the biological drive to seek justice through revenge. As co-moderator of <em>American Renaissance</em>&lsquo;s AR List, Jobling was the first on that E-group to ban posts about Jews, arguing that such talk &ldquo;lowered the quality of discussion.&rdquo; He had no such compunctions about discussions of non-whites, arguing that Western values of democracy, free speech, and the rule of law &ldquo;will gradually disappear as non-whites gain in numbers and power.&rdquo; Elsewhere, in his 2003 essay &ldquo;Competitive Altruism and White Self-Destruction,&rdquo; Jobling argued that whites are too caring to protect their own interests. That same year, Jobling, along with two co-authors from academia, hit the big-time with the publication in <em>Human Nature </em>of the article, &ldquo;Proper and Dark Heroes as Dads and Cads: Alternative Mating Strategies in British Romantic Literature.&rdquo; After interviewing a series of women about romantic novels, the authors concluded that, in the short term, women prefer men who are &ldquo;cads,&rdquo; leading to temporary media-sensation status for Jobling and the others.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin T. Lamb, 43</strong><br>
Mt. Airy, Md.</p>
<p>Until his firing in 2005, Kevin Lamb was an editor who had reached the heights of conservative journalism, serving as managing editor of <em>Human Events </em>magazine and also <em>The Evans-Novak Political Report.</em> That ended after his boss, Thomas White, fired him from both positions after learning from the Southern Poverty Law Center that Lamb was simultaneously editing the white supremacist journal <em>The Occidental Quarterly. </em>After his firing, Lamb wrote a bitter essay saying that several fellow employees had known of his work for the racist quarterly, including Al Regnery, the conservative publisher who owns <em>Human Events </em>and <em>The Evans-Novak Report. </em>In fact, Lamb had written for racist publications going all the way back to the early 1990s, when he published works in <em>Mankind Quarterly.</em> He also edited a 2002 book on Glayde Whitney, a racist academic who once wrote a fawning introduction for former Klan leader David Duke. Today, Lamb, a graduate of Indiana University with a political science degree, continues as editor of <em>The Occidental Quarterly </em>and is also the communications director for the National Policy Institute, a racist think tank, both of which were started by William H. Regnery, a cousin of Al Regnery&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><strong>Joel T. LeFevre, 38</strong><br>
Charleston, W.V.</p>
<p>Just weeks after <em>Citizens Informer </em>Editor Sam Francis selected him as successor, Joel LeFevre had to take up the reins of the racist Council of Conservative Citizens&rsquo; publication because of Francis&rsquo; sudden death, putting out his first issue in March 2005. LeFevre had been a regular participant in the monthly roundtable discussions that Francis hosted at the Sala Thai Restaurant in Arlington, Va., but only joined the CCC, he told the <em>Intelligence Report,</em> after CCC boss Gordon Baum assured him that the group was not anti-Semitic. LeFevre&rsquo;s attitude toward Jews, however, does not extend to black people. He rejects the Constitution&rsquo;s Fourteenth Amendment, which gave former slaves citizenship, calling it &ldquo;an abomination &mdash; a death knell not only to the old confederation of States, but to the white race itself.&rdquo; He owns a website devoted to R. Carter Pittman, a Georgia lawyer who battled school integration. This March, he endorsed &ldquo;kinism,&rdquo; a new strain of racial separatism that wants America broken up into racial mini-states. Policies supporting integration, LeFevre wrote, &ldquo;seem &lsquo;fair&rsquo; to a lot of people, but they are insidious &hellip; . [V]ery simply, without some level of discrimination, no nation &hellip; can permanently exist at all.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin MacDonald, 62</strong><br>
Long Beach, Calif.</p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald, a professor of psychology at California State University-Long Beach, is the man the radical right hopes will make anti-Semitism respectable. With a master&rsquo;s degree in evolutionary biology and a Ph.D. in biobehavioral sciences, MacDonald is the author of a trilogy of books, written between 1994 and 1998, that argue that Jews use a &ldquo;group evolutionary strategy&rdquo; to survive in the &ldquo;host&rdquo; societies where they are typically tiny minorities. The &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; involves backing democracy, equality, socialism and the like in order to weaken the dominant ethnic group &mdash; the idea being that that will keep Jews safer. An example of his thinking came in a recent posting to the V-Dare hate website: &ldquo;Despite the fact that Jews constitute less than 3% of the U.S. population, the Holocaust has become a cultural icon as a direct result of Jewish activism and influence in the media, Israel has become a sacred cow &hellip; and the role of Jewish organizations in helping unleash massive multiethnic immigration into the U.S&hellip; .   goes unmentioned.&rdquo; In one of his books, MacDonald blames the deaths of &ldquo;millions of people&rdquo; on &ldquo;the failure of Jewish assimilation into European societies.&rdquo; He has even suggested that colleges restrict Jewish admission and that Jews be heavily taxed to offset the Jews&rsquo; &ldquo;advantage &hellip; of wealth.&rdquo; In a recent film, MacDonald says that by supporting immigration and multiculturalism, Jews &ldquo;have wanted to essentially end European domination of this society.&rdquo; MacDonald is on the advisory committee of the National Policy Institute, a racist think tank, and is a frequent contributor to <em>The Occidental Quarterly,</em> a white supremacist journal.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Rogers, 29</strong><br>
Charleston, S.C.</p>
<p>With a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in computer engineering from Ohio State University, Kyle Rogers has become a key player in the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens since first joining the CCC&rsquo;s Ohio Valley chapter in early 2001. He told the <em>Intelligence Report </em>that he joined after tiring of &ldquo;the media telling us that everything Southern and everything European is bad.&rdquo; Today, Rogers lives in Charleston, S.C., where he moved in 2004 for &ldquo;business&rdquo; reasons, and heads the local CCC chapter. He is on the group&rsquo;s national board of directors and is also its main webmaster, says CCC leader Gordon Baum. Rogers owns Patriot-Flags.com, an online store that sells a variety of flags &mdash; along with &ldquo;White Pride Worldwide&rdquo; T-shirts that can only be accessed via a link on the CCC&rsquo;s home page (he was selling the shirts at this year&rsquo;s <em>American Renaissance </em>conference, a racist meeting in Herndon, Va.). Rogers leads one of the most active chapters in the CCC, and has held repeated rallies at the South Carolina Capitol to protest undocumented workers. He urges members of the CCC to remind the Republican Party that it should be &ldquo;standing up for whites.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Webster, 40</strong><br>
Winchester, Va.</p>
<p>Born in Chicago and holding degrees in political science, history and geography from Indiana University, Stephen Webster is the assistant editor of <em>American Renaissance,</em> a racist journal whose staff he says he joined in 2001 after a career in insurance, conservative politics and academia. Webster has become a chief spokesman for the magazine and frequently answers the group&rsquo;s phone, which is located in Editor Jared Taylor&rsquo;s home in Oakton, Va. Over the years, he has become best known for his relentless retellings of what he calls &ldquo;The Wichita Massacre,&rdquo; the horrific murders of four whites by two black brothers. Webster&rsquo;s beef is that while the brothers were arrested and charged with capital murder, prosecutors consistently ruled out race as a motive and did not seek hate crime penalty enhancements. That mantra has been picked up across the far right &mdash; by players including former leftist David Horowitz and the far-right Accuracy in Media&rsquo;s publications &mdash; even though there is no evidence at all that the crime was, in fact, racially motivated.</p>
