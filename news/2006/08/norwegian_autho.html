<h1><a href="https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2006/07/norwegian-authorities-still-covering.html">Norwegian Authorities Still Covering Up Muslim Rapes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Baron Bodissey, The Fjordman Report, July 27, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There has been a spike in the number of rape charges in Scandinavia in recent years<a href="https://fjordman.blogspot.com/2005/12/immigrant-rape-wave-in-sweden.html">. It has reached near epidemic proportions in Sweden.</a> Although there are indications of a very high percentage of Muslim immigrants on the statistics, as it is with other kinds of crime, immigration is a non-issue for the political establishment a few weeks ahead of the Swedish national elections.</p>
<p>In neighboring Norway, there is an unprecedented rape wave in the capital city of Oslo. &ldquo;We have to be realistic. A series of rapes have made Oslo unsafe during the summer,&rdquo; says Brit Opjordsmoen from DIXI, support centre for rape victims. &ldquo;When we know that there are rapists on the loose in Oslo, we have to listen to advice from the police. They are right in warning women against going home alone at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opjordsmoen thinks it is astounding that Minister of Justice Knut Storberget gives advice contrary to that of the police, encouraging women not to change their behavior. &ldquo;Ideally, we can all agree that girls should be able to move around freely, but we have to be realistic. Society is not like that. Many girls are too naïve, we have to be careful and watch out. Several rapes assaults in a short period of time is unusual,&rdquo; says Opjordsmoen.</p>
<p>According to the support centre, rapes are usually committed by a person known to the victim. The peculiar thing about the many rapes in the city of Oslo now is that they are rapes by ambush, committed by strangers against women on their way home from a bar or in areas with little traffic. &ldquo;We have seen a dramatic increase [in the number of rapes],&rdquo; says Endre Sandvik, head of the emergency ward. The number of rapes in Oslo this summer is more than twice as high as it was last year.</p>
<p>In a questions and answers session with newspaper Aftenposten&rsquo;s readers, Opjordsmoen has some politically correct comments, saying that they don&rsquo;t know what percentage of these rapes are committed by people with immigrant background, and that much of these speculations is just &ldquo;prejudice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all due respect, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s incorrect. Just a few weeks earlier, Aftenposten warned that <a href="https://www.faithfreedom.org/oped/Fjordman60425.htm">&ldquo;youths&rdquo; are in the process of destroying </a>Norway&rsquo;s capital city, Oslo. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that these &ldquo;youths&rdquo; bear a striking resemblance to the same &ldquo;youths&rdquo; with Muslim immigrant background that are destroying so many cities across Western Europe. I know Norwegian girls that have experienced harassment by gangs, and it almost always involves Muslims: Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Pakistanis, and Somalis.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old Somalian was convicted of the rape of a young girl in Oslo one year ago. The court stated that the rape was unusually brutal and lasted for several hours. The Somalian choked the girl for so long that the medical doctor who examined the girl said that she could have died. The girl is now suffering from severe psychological problems in the aftermath of the attack. The youth was sentenced to four and half years in prison. The sentence also included another rape, where his Norwegian-Moroccan friend raped a 13-year-old girl whilst the Somalian helped to threaten her and keep guard. She has been traumatized from the incident.</p>
<p>However, Aftenposten seems conveniently enough to have forgotten an article they printed five years ago. In 2001, <a href="https://fjordman.blogspot.com/2005/07/norwegian-government-covering-up.html">two out of three charged with rape in Norway&rsquo;s capital </a>were immigrants with a non-western background according to a police study. Norwegian women were victims in 80 percent of the cases.</p>
<p>Unni Wikan, a professor of social anthropology at the University of Oslo, in 2001 said that &ldquo;Norwegian women must take their share of responsibility for these rapes&rdquo; because Muslim men found their manner of dress provocative. The professor&rsquo;s conclusion was not that Muslim men living in the West needed to adjust to Western norms, but the exact opposite: &ldquo;Norwegian women must realize that we live in a Multicultural society and adapt themselves to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The numbers published in September 2001 were discussed in at least to out of Norway&rsquo;s three largest newspapers: Aftenposten and Dagbladet. A leading member of the Liberal Party (Venstre), Odd Einar Dørum, demanded that all the numbers should be put on the table: &ldquo;A scumbag is a scumbag, regardless of skin color&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2005, Dørum was Minister of Justice, and yet nobody has seen these statistics since 2001. The number of rape charges in Oslo has continued to rise, reaching record levels in 2005. There is ample evidence of brutal gang rapes, something that used to be rare in Scandinavia, being committed by immigrants against native girls. For instance, 21st of July 2005, three men were charged with gang raping a 15-year-old Norwegian girl, who was dragged into a car while waiting for a bus at the bus station in the town of Fredrikstad. All the men were of &ldquo;foreign origin&rdquo;. Such cases have become almost routine. The only possible explanation for why we are no longer presented statistics showing the percentage of immigrants involved in this is that the authorities are covering it up. Usually, this would have made the media call for the government&rsquo;s resignation. This has not happened, although I know several journalists have been reading the posts I have made about this topic, both in <a href="https://fjordman.blogspot.com/2005/07/norwegian-government-covering-up.html">English </a>and in Norwegian.</p>
<p><a href="https://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2006/05/new-york-times-and-sweden-dark-side-of.html">In Sweden, ethnologist Maria Bäckman,</a> in her study &ldquo;Whiteness and gender,&rdquo; has followed a group of Swedish girls in the suburb of Rinkeby outside Stockholm, where native Swedes have been turned into a tiny minority of the inhabitants due to rapid immigration. Bäckman relates that several of the girls she interviewed stated that they had dyed their hair to avoid unwanted attention and sexual harassment. They experienced that being blonde involves old men staring at you, cars honking their horns and boys calling you &ldquo;whore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A report from organization Save the Children tells of how being a young Swedish girl today means feeling unsafe. The girls are scared of being raped, a possibility that appears very real to them. Many girls are planning how to go home at night, how to pretend to be talking on the mobile phone, how to keep their keys in their hand to defend themselves or how to simply run all the way home. Both the fear and the choice of strategies indicate that many girls feel genuinely unsafe outdoors during certain hours of the day. The fear is well founded. A striking number of girls have experienced harassment from boys or men. Most frequently, the harassment comes from boys of the same age as the girls. Being called &ldquo;whore&rdquo; has become so common in some schools that several of the girls say the teachers no longer react to this.</p>
<p>Tensta is a suburb in northern Stockholm with a very high concentration of Muslim immigrants. Actress Ylva Törnlund has visited several schools in Tensta, and was alarmed by the harsh atmosphere she discovered there. &ldquo;The attitudes we meet in the schools are frightening. One boy talked about how girls should be f**ked to pieces until they bleed,&rdquo; Törnlund said.</p>
<p>This trend is not exclusive to Scandinavia. It is the same all over Western Europe wherever we find significant numbers of Muslim immigrants. In fact, the number of rapes committed by Muslim immigrants in Western nations is so extremely high that it is difficult to view them only as random acts of individuals. <a href="https://fjordman.blogspot.com/2005/08/rape-nothing-to-do-with-islam.html">It resembles warfare</a>. German journalist Gudrun Eussner considers this to be &ldquo;sexuality as a weapon against disobedient and non-Muslim women, both categorized as &ldquo;unbelievers&rdquo;. Against them jihad is the duty, and what to do with women &ldquo;conquered&rdquo; in jihad, this may be read in the Qur&rsquo;an: they become slaves to be used by the victors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French filmmaker Pierre Rehov states that: &ldquo;A friend of mine is a retired chief of police, who used to be in charge of the security of a major city in the south of France. He reported to me that his men had to face an average of 10 rapes a week, 80% made by Muslim young men. 30% being what we call, in French, a &ldquo;tournante,&rdquo; meaning that the victim is being raped by an entire gang, one after the other, often during an entire night.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was astonished that, in most cases, the parents not only would back up their rapist children, but also would not even understand why they would be arrested. There is an instant shift in the notion of good and evil as a major component of culture. The only evil those parents would see, genuinely, is the temptation that the male children had to face. Since in most cases the victims were not Muslims, the parents&rsquo; answer and rejection was even more genuine: how could their boys be guilty of anything, when normally answering to a provocation by occidental women, known for their unacceptable behavior?&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Rehov, &ldquo;I can see in any raping of a non-Muslim woman by a Muslim male a racist action, and it is high time for us to acknowledge and condemn it. The level of contempt towards non-Muslim women is the reflection of the level of hatred towards the society which creates equality between men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Norway, it is probably unprecedented in the thousand years since the city of Oslo was founded at the end of the Viking Age that the indigenous population is being attacked on such a large scale for the sole reason of being white and Christian. And the government is doing &hellip;  well, pretty much nothing really, except for hiding the problem as much as possible. This isn&rsquo;t good enough. I have earlier called for the resignation of Swedish PM Göran Persson for his government&rsquo;s total inability to protect a population that pays the highest taxes in the world. Perhaps the time has come for calling for the resignation of Norwegian PM Jens Stoltenberg and his cabinet, too.</p>
<p>If they want to stay in power, they should immediately double if not triple the amount of police officers in the streets, and they should end the Multicultural experiment and stop Muslim immigration completely, if necessary by withdrawing from the UN Convention for Refugees and other international treaties, pulling out of the Schengen Agreement and re-establish genuine, national and popular control over immigration.</p>
<p>We are tired of hearing nonsense about &ldquo;Islamophobia&rdquo; and xenophobia while our children live in fear of Islamic terrorism and our daughters cannot go home after dark out of fear of gang rapes by Muslim youngsters who view them as whores. The purpose of the state is to uphold law and order and maintain the nation&rsquo;s borders and territorial integrity. Western European governments are doing neither, yet are busy with political censorship and interfering with details of our private lives where they have no business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time they are reminded that they are our servants, not our rulers. If they will not fulfill their duties, they need to be replaced by somebody who will.</p>
