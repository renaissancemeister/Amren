<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14140370/">Investigation: U.S. Borders Perilously Porous</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Myers, NBC, August 1, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal investigators easily pass border checks using fake identification</p>
<p>Along the northern and southern borders, undercover federal investigators tried to enter the United States using fake driver&rsquo;s licenses and fake birth certificates.</p>
<p>The results? Staggering. At all nine border crossings tested, investigators got in easily. Not a single border agent detected the phony IDs. In fact, at two crossings, agents didn&rsquo;t even check any IDs at all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, this investigation by the Government Accountability Office is a follow-up to one three years ago in which three crossings were tested, and all the agents failed to detect the fake IDs.</p>
<p>At the time, we gave a Washington, D.C., bar manager a stack of IDs to see if he could pick out a fake license &mdash; almost exactly the same as the one government agents missed.</p>
<p>He did. </p>
<p>Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, says it&rsquo;s appalling that nothing has been fixed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Department of Homeland Security hasn&rsquo;t made any progress in three years!&rdquo; Grassley says.</p>
<p>We will not reveal the exact crossings tested this year, but they&rsquo;re in a variety of states: California, Arizona, Texas, Washington, Michigan and New York. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 9/11 commission and now DHS say the answer is to require passports for everyone crossing the border &mdash; even Americans.<br>

															<h2>I Bought A &lsquo;Green Card&rsquo; For $110 From I.D. Ring</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Douglas Montero, New York Post, July 5, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>For an illegal immigrant desperately seeking to work in New York City, getting a high-quality forged green card or Social Security card is almost as easy as buying a soft-shell taco, a Post investigation has found. </p>
<p>The well-organized underground market that churns out these fraudulent documents is surprisingly easy to penetrate &mdash; The Post was able to find a man who deals in the bogus cards and buy one in just under three hours. </p>
<p>After speaking with immigrant advocates and a few streetwise sources, this reporter arranged a face-to-face meeting in Queens with a 20-something Hispanic man known in the neighborhood as &ldquo;Flaco&rdquo; &mdash; the Spanish word for thin. </p>
<p>Soft-spoken, low key and simply dressed in a button-down shirt that covered the waistband of his jeans, Flaco didn&rsquo;t appear to be threatening at all &mdash; surprising, considering that these sophisticated green-card mills are run by vicious Latin American gangs. </p>
<p>The groups carve up territory block by block and use bullets to deal with competitors who venture onto their lucrative turf. </p>
<p>Flaco led me across Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, under a rumbling No. 7 train, keeping a few paces ahead of me. His eyes continually surveyed the block for cops, but he didn&rsquo;t notice a Post photographer sitting in a nearby car. </p>
<p>We jetted past men heading into bars to watch the World Cup, and women who ran errands with their kids, popping in and out of the stores. </p>
<p>We spoke only in Spanish. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told it would cost $110 for the green card and Social [Security card],&rdquo; I said nervously. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, no problem,&rdquo; Flaco answered. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gesturing with his long, skinny arms, Flaco led me to a nearby photo-lab store run by an Asian couple. He motioned to a small wooden stool partially behind the L-shaped glass counter. </p>
<p>He was so secure in his environment, he acted as if he owned the place. </p>
<p>A Latino photo-lab worker jumped to attention and trained an expensive digital camera on me. The Asian couple tended to other customers, minding their business. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the flag,&rdquo; the Latino barked, as he gestured to a small American flag wedged into the wall. </p>
<p>After handing the Asian woman $6 for the photo, Flaco whipped out a small pink sheet of paper and told me to write my name, date of birth and country of origin. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back in an hour,&rdquo; Flaco said as he ushered me out of the store. &ldquo;Wait for me outside the shopping center, not inside, because they have cameras.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>My fake green card looked a lot more real than I had been expecting. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So I could get a job with this?&rdquo; I asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Flaco answered, eager to move on to his next customer. </p>
<p>The sale of these fraudulent cards is a cottage industry that rakes in millions a year &mdash; but no one knows the number of green cards sold daily here. Based on the quality of the work and low cost, from $75 to $120, it appears certain the industry is flourishing. </p>
<p>Immigration experts who reviewed my fake green card agreed the document looks authentic &mdash; but said that upon closer examination, slight flaws became obvious. &ldquo;I would say a person that does not deal with these green cards will take this as a genuine one,&rdquo; said Maria Delgado, who has seen hundreds of green cards at the Immigration Center at the St. Francis of Assisi Church in Midtown. &ldquo;A potential employer is not familiar with green cards &mdash; and besides, they need the workers, so they won&rsquo;t really question the legitimacy of the cards.&rdquo; </p>
