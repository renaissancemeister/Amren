						<p>Chicago &mdash; Democrats, eager to give African Americans and Hispanics a bigger voice in picking a presidential nominee, adopted a new caucus and primary calendar Saturday that puts new states on the coveted early-voting calendar.</p>
<p>The new calendar would add Nevada, with a large and growing Hispanic population, and South Carolina, with its large African-American population, to the two largely white states of Iowa and New Hampshire that have dominated the early voting for a generation. Democrats see both minorities as critical to the party&rsquo;s success in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plan had broad support from minorities, many of whom cheered and hugged when it was adopted. U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, noted it was backed by the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.</p>
<p>Whether all states &mdash; and candidates &mdash; will follow the new calendar remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Among key opponents of the shift was Kathleen Sullivan, head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.</p>
<p>She said that by cramming so many contests so close together, Democrats will allow their nominee to be chosen by fewer than 500,000 voters in just four states. &ldquo;That is not democracy and that is not diversity,&rdquo; Sullivan said.</p>
<p>New Hampshire state law requires the state primary be scheduled seven days earlier than any &ldquo;similar&rdquo; election.</p>
<p>While the state has recognized the earlier Iowa caucuses as different and thus OK &mdash; they are town-hall meetings rather than a primary &mdash; state officials have chafed at whether they would give Nevada&rsquo;s caucuses a similar pass.</p>
<p>New Hampshire officials could move their primary forward to as early as December 2007. They won&rsquo;t decide until next year, after all other states have set their voting dates.</p>

															<h2><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20060819/D8JJON9O0.html">Dems Shake Up Nominating Calendar</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Jim Kuhnhenn, AP, August 19, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Chicago &mdash; Democrats shook up tradition on Saturday by vaulting Nevada and South Carolina into the first wave of 2008 presidential contests along with Iowa and New Hampshire &mdash; a move intended to add racial and geographic diversity to the early voting.</p>
<p>The decision by the Democratic National Committee leaves Iowa as the nation&rsquo;s first presidential caucus and New Hampshire as the first primary, but wedges Nevada&rsquo;s caucuses before New Hampshire and South Carolina&rsquo;s primary soon afterward.</p>
<p>The move also packs all four state contests into a politically saturated two weeks in January. The change means a potentially huge cast of Democratic presidential candidates could winnow quickly by the beginning of February.</p>
<p>Party officials embraced the change, though New Hampshire Democrats joined several likely presidential candidates and former President Clinton in opposing the move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an opportunity for the candidates to speak in a broader way to Democrats across the country,&rdquo; said Alexis M. Herman, co-chairman of the DNC&rsquo;s rules committee that drafted the change. &ldquo;It will be a plus for the candidates and I think they will take advantage of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driving the decision to alter the schedule was a long-held worry within the party that Iowa and New Hampshire, which are predominantly white, were not representative of the country&rsquo;s population and key Democratic constituencies. Blacks and Hispanics have complained they haven&rsquo;t had an adequate voice in the early contests.</p>
<p>In choosing to squeeze Nevada caucuses between Iowa&rsquo;s Jan. 14 caucus and New Hampshire&rsquo;s Jan. 22 primary, party leaders kept in mind the state&rsquo;s large Hispanic population as well as its heavy labor union presence.</p>
<p>South Carolina, with its large black population, could hold its primary as early as Jan. 29.</p>
<p>But the primary calendar may not be final.</p>
<p>New Hampshire objected loudly to the lineup and has threatened to leapfrog over the other contests to retain its pre-eminent role.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The DNC did not give New Hampshire its primary, and it is not taking it away,&rdquo; New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State William Gardner, also a Democrat, emphasized again Saturday that it will be his office, not Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, who picks the state&rsquo;s primary date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be based on state law, and it will be a date that honors the tradition,&rdquo; Gardner said after the DNC action. &ldquo;It appears that he&rsquo;s in the driver&rsquo;s seat taking the Democratic National Committee on a collision course with the New Hampshire tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gardner, who has said he will decide next year when to schedule his state&rsquo;s primary, also said the plan to punish candidates who campaign in New Hampshire was an affront to a state with a long history of promoting greater participation in the political process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty insulting and disrespectful to the potential candidates and to the people of the state that they&rsquo;re being threatened,&rdquo; said Gardner.</p>
