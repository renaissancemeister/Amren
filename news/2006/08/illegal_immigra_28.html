<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In a recent interview by Tara Malone in the Daily Herald, U. S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert repeated the mistaken slogan that &ldquo;This country&rsquo;s always been a nation of immigrants.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is surprising that a man of Hastert&rsquo;s background could make a mistake like this. The inability to distinguish between the original settlers and the immigrants who came to the United States legally, after the nation was formed, demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of our history. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Oscar Avila, a Chicago Tribune staff reporter writes, &ldquo;A prominent activist for illegal immigrants in Chicago &hellip; defied a government order that she turn herself in to the Department of Homeland Security for deportation and instead took sanctuary in a West Side church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tribune reporter Avila continues, &ldquo;The 31-year-old woman was arrested in 2002 during an immigration sweep at O&rsquo;Hare International Airport. Homeland Security officials noted that Arellano had already been deported once, in 1997, and that she had a criminal conviction for Social Security fraud.&rdquo; This conviction makes her ineligible for U. S. citizenship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that after being in this country illegally for 7 years and after giving birth to an anchor baby, Elvira Arellano would at least know English. Apparently not. Speaking through an interpreter, she said, &ldquo;If Homeland Security chooses to send agents to a holy place, I would know that God wants me to serve as an example of the hatred and hypocrisy of the current administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the Socialist Worker Online, Elvira&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;Seven-year-old Saul, who was born in the U. S., told those gathered at the church for a recent service, &lsquo;I want Bush to stop the deportations, so my mom can stay here with me.&rsquo;&rdquo; You have to wonder who&rsquo;s talking to this child. One of the complaints about the Bush administration is that it hasn&rsquo;t yet started mass deportations. Listen, little Saul, it&rsquo;s hard to stop what hasn&rsquo;t started.</p>
<p>Jesse Rios, executive director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, said at a rally in support of the fugitive Elvira Arellano that &ldquo;The system is broken. It&rsquo;s tearing families apart. She is a hardworking woman just trying to keep it together. This is not an issue of the law, but of human rights. Where&rsquo;s the family values in breaking up families?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Rios made no mention of Elvira Arellano&rsquo;s partner who fathered her son Saul, where he is, and why he cannot help take care of the child. Nor did Mr. Rios wonder why Elvira knowingly had a child as a single woman while in the United Stateas illegally.</p>
<p>Mayor Richard Daley, whose directive makes Chicago a Sanctuary City for illegal immigrants, said in support of Elvira Arellano, &ldquo;You have to sit down and look at her and her family and how long she&rsquo;s been here and look at it in a personal way, not just another number.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Daley added, &ldquo;And Chicago, it&rsquo;s a city of immigrants. Our past, our present, our future will be immigrants.&rdquo; Of course, the mayor, too, is wrong about our immigrant history. Chicago was not founded by immigrants, but instead, it was founded by settlers.</p>
<p>Elvira Arellano is supported in her protest by an unusual coalition. She is the president of United Latino Family, a group that lobbies for families that could be split by deportation. She is, then, the head of a group that wants to solve the very problem she created. Elvira Arellano also receives support from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and the Centro Sin Fronteras.</p>
<p>The drive-by media never mentions that many of the groups supporting Elvira are anarchist or communist groups with an unstated mission of defeating the United States of America. Think for a moment, just what is the aim of a group that calls itself &ldquo;Center Without Borders?&rdquo; Why would its members be helping a fugitive?</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Illegal immigrants have turned around the lives of many Americans, altering our communities for the worse, wasting our tax dollars, and transforming our public schools. It&rsquo;s time to turn out of office those politicians who refuse to deport illegal immigrants. It&rsquo;s time also for you, Elvira Arellano, to go home to Mexico. And when you leave, shut the door behind you.<br>

															<h2>Illegal Prettyface = Sacrilegious Hiding In Church</h2>
											<p>
							<i>J. Grant Swank, Jr., MichNews.com, August 25, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>It&rsquo;s using the church sanctuary for an illegal purpose. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not morally right.</p>
<p>The Methodist pastor should know better. Yet he condones the mother-pretty-face and baby staying inside his sanctuary because she is trying to remain in the US illegally.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not a mid-teen who doesn&rsquo;t understand the law. She knows exactly what she is &mdash; an illegal. She knowingly posts herself and child inside a House of God with the appeal that she has found &ldquo;sanctuary.&rdquo; Therefore, the law cannot touch her.</p>
<p>But there is no such law in America. It might have been an understanding in cultures of another time, but not in the USA today.</p>
<p>Time will tell whether she will be forcibly taken from the hallowed environs; however, in the meantime, she is committing sacrilege. It&rsquo;s not ethically proper for her to claim sanctity safety when purposefully breaking the law. Further, in being such a mother, she is teaching her child how to break the law.</p>
<p>This goes on every day in this country. </p>
<p>Illegals are made out to be these unfortunate specimens who must find haven beneath the Statue of Liberty&rsquo;s torch. Not. They came here knowing they were breaking the law. Therefore, the US Congress and executive offices should oust them as soon as possible.</p>
