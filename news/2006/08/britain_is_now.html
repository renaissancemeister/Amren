<p>Article from <i>New Republic</i>: &#8220;Kashmir On The Thames.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>Britain now presents a greater security threat to the United States than Iran or Iraq, an American magazine said yesterday.</p>
<p>In an article on Islamists headlined &ldquo;Kashmir on the Thames&rdquo;, the New Republic painted Britain&rsquo;s Muslim communities as a breeding ground for violent extremism.</p>
<p>Citing recent opinion poll evidence suggesting that one in four British Muslims believed that last year&rsquo;s London Tube bombings were justified, the magazine said: &ldquo;In the wake of this month&rsquo;s high-profile arrests, it can now be argued that the biggest threat to US security emanates not from Iran or Iraq or Afghanistan, but rather from Great Britain, our closest ally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magazine, with a circulation of 60,000-a-week, has its roots on the Democratic Left although in recent years it has backed much of President George W Bush&rsquo;s foreign policy. The claim is the latest in a series of hostile reassessment of Britain by Americans in the wake of the alleged plot to bring down transatlantic airliners.</p>
<p>Many have been appalled both by the existence of enthusiastic jihadis in British cities and by the call from some of their leaders for a change in the country&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p>
<p>Other publications and the think-tanks that shape public debate in America have also issued stern criticism both of Britain&rsquo;s Muslims and of the Government. Nile Gardiner, of the Right-wing Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Telegraph yesterday that Americans were coming to view Britain as &ldquo;a hornet&rsquo;s nest of Islamic extremists&rdquo; and thought it posed &ldquo;a direct security threat to the US&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said that if British-based terrorism continues, America is likely to respond harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A major concern would be the tightening of travel restrictions unless the authorities start to crack down on Islamist militancy,&rdquo; he said. More than four million Britons enter America annually using the visa waiver programme. Any change would force Britons wishing to visit the US into lengthy queues at American diplomatic missions.</p>
<p>Mr Gardiner said the issue had not yet acquired a head of steam in Congress, but that another plot, or a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; attack by British Muslims on an American target, would be likely to spur an immediate response.</p>
<p>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily has already demanded an end to the programme because it &ldquo;allows Pakistani Britons to dodge security background checks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Much of the outraged American response this month was sparked by the call from Muslim leaders for a change in British foreign policy. The letter from six Muslim MPs and 38 community leaders said &ldquo;current British Government policy risks putting civilians at increased risk both in the UK and abroad&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The theme was taken up by the Wall Street Journal, which said: &ldquo;It is typical of some of Britain&rsquo;s so-called moderate Muslims, who seem less concerned with fighting extremists in their midst than in excusing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newspaper went on to attack Tony Blair&rsquo;s government for &ldquo;cultivating and promoting such pseudo-moderate Muslim organisations&rdquo;. The BBC and the Foreign Office, described as &ldquo;a preserve of Arabists&rdquo;, were also lambasted both for quoting extremists and allowing them into Britain.</p>
