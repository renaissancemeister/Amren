<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Sen. George Allen of Virginia was born in Southern California, is the son of a former football legend, and is a political conservative. He&rsquo;s strong on national defense, favors tax cuts, and, as a former governor, has a record of being tough on crime. He is also a budding GOP presidential candidate who has been considered a top contender for the top job. </p>
<p>But while campaigning for re-election to the Senate recently, Mr. Allen stumbled to reveal a weakness that could keep him from a spot on the national ticket. At a stop near the Kentucky border, Mr. Allen poked fun at S.R. Sidarth, a 20-year-old Virginia native of Indian descent who was there to gather opposition research for Democratic challenger Jim Webb. &ldquo;This fellow here, over here with the yellow shirt, macaca, or whatever his name is,&rdquo; Mr. Allen said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s with my opponent.&rdquo; The senator then went on to welcome the man to &ldquo;real America.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Allen&rsquo;s comments drew a laugh from the crowd and criticism in the national media. The <em>Washington Post</em> pointed out that Macaca is a genus of monkey, and that in parts of Europe the word is used as a derisive term for African immigrants. This led to accusations of racism. <em>National Review </em>editor Rich Lowry, apparently hoping to cool the criticism, called the senator&rsquo;s comments simply &ldquo;mean.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Neither criticism fits. Mr. Allen&rsquo;s problem is neither that he is a vicious campaigner nor that he is a modern-day George Wallace. Rather, it is that for more than two decades in state and federal office, he has displayed a dismaying indifference to his adoptive state&rsquo;s racial history. And it is this political tone-deafness that is now weighing down his political future with Southern baggage. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> In his defense, Mr. Allen is now pointing to his political record that includes pushing legislation to apologize for the Senate&rsquo;s failure to enact national antilynching laws in the early 20th century. As governor, he supported increasing funding to historically black colleges. </p>
<p>But his political record also contains less flattering details. As a state legislator in the 1980s, Mr. Allen opposed making Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday a state holiday. While running for governor in 1993 he admitted that he had displayed a Confederate flag in his living room as part of a &ldquo;flag collection.&rdquo; Mr. Allen was also found to have a noose hanging from a ficus tree in his personal law office, something he called part of a &ldquo;Western motif.&rdquo; And while serving as governor Mr. Allen proclaimed April as Confederate Heritage Month. These are not the actions of a politician who understands legitimate sensitivities over his state&rsquo;s racial history &mdash; a history that includes slavery, Jim Crow and, more recently, resisting integration of its public schools in the late 1950s. Nor are they the actions of a politician who is working fastidiously to overcome this history.  </p>

															<h2><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/15/AR2006081501210.html">Allen on Damage Control After Remarks to Webb Aide</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Michael D. Shear and Tim Craig, Washington Post, August 16, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Richmond &mdash; Sen. George Allen on Tuesday sought to contain the political damage from remarks he made to a Fairfax County man that dredged up charges of racial insensitivity &mdash; allegations that have dogged him for years as governor, senator and now presidential hopeful.</p>
<p>Despite a quick apology Monday, criticism poured in about Allen&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;Macaca&rdquo; to address a volunteer for the campaign of his Democratic opponent, James Webb, and also about another Allen comment, &ldquo;Welcome to America.&rdquo; Democrats, left-wing bloggers and civil rights groups called him &ldquo;insensitive&rdquo; and &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; while some conservatives called him &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; and &ldquo;mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was fiercely debated all day: Was &ldquo;Macaca,&rdquo; which literally means a genus of monkey, a deliberate racist epithet or a weird ad-libbed word with no meaning? And what was Allen trying to say by singling out the young man of Indian descent?</p>
<p>Allen&rsquo;s defenders rushed to his side, saying the comments, though careless, do not reflect what is inside the senator&rsquo;s heart. Sudhakar Shenoy, an Indian business executive from Fairfax who has known Allen for years, said he &ldquo;has been an incredible friend to Indians&rdquo; and is not a racist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d stake everything I have that George is not that kind of a guy,&rdquo; Shenoy said.</p>
<p>In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, Allen (R-Va.) said his remarks Friday to S.R. Sidarth, who at the time was videotaping an Allen campaign event on Webb&rsquo;s behalf, &ldquo;have been greatly misunderstood by members of the media.&rdquo; He said Monday that &ldquo;Macaca&rdquo; was a play on &ldquo;Mohawk,&rdquo; a nickname given to Sidarth by the Allen campaign because of his hairstyle. In Tuesday&rsquo;s statement, Allen said he &ldquo;made up a nickname for the cameraman, which was in no way intended to be racially derogatory. Any insinuations to the contrary are completely false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The comments were made at a campaign stop in the southwestern Virginia town of Breaks, where Allen spoke to about 100 supporters. Moments after greeting the crowd, Allen repeatedly pointed at Sidarth, called him &ldquo;Macaca, or whatever his name is&rdquo; and went on to say, &ldquo;Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia,&rdquo; as the crowd laughed.</p>
<p>With the video of Allen&rsquo;s remarks available around the globe via Youtube.com and other Web sites, the Virginia controversy became one of the most blogged-about topics on the Internet, according to the Technorati Web site, which tracks entries on 51.3 million blogs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the past two years, as Allen has flirted with the idea of running for president in 2008, he has introduced symbolic anti-lynching legislation in the Senate and promised to lead the charge for an official apology for slavery. Political pundits who follow Allen closely said the new comments threaten that well-planned effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are very few issues in American politics that are more sensitive than race. Senator Allen has just plunked himself down in the middle of it,&rdquo; said Geoffrey D. Garin, a leading Democratic pollster. &ldquo;Allen&rsquo;s comments take him back to a place he was trying to escape from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mark Potok, director of the intelligence project for the Southern Poverty Law Center, based in Montgomery, Ala., said it was &ldquo;simply impossible to believe&rdquo; that Allen did not intend the comments as a racial insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, it looks like yet another case of a politician pandering to the worst instincts in an all-white crowd,&rdquo; Potok said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, wrote on the magazine&rsquo;s Web site Tuesday that he did not think Allen was &ldquo;trying to speak a coded racist language.&rdquo; But Lowry said Allen showed he &ldquo;has a mean streak.&rdquo;</p>
