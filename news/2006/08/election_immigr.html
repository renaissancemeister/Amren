<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The caller to the talk-radio show discussing &ldquo;the illegal-alien invasion&rdquo; listed the three strikes against Republican Will McBride&rsquo;s campaign for the U.S. Senate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lawyer for one thing. You&rsquo;re young. And you&rsquo;re Hispanic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last comment troubled McBride &mdash; partly because it&rsquo;s true. For the 34-year-old son of a Mexican field worker has found he&rsquo;s campaigning against GOP icon Katherine Harris, two other little-known candidates and an insidious challenge: the &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; tone over immigration from a minority of Republicans.</p>
<p>And it worries not just McBride, but also Republican leaders seeking to protect the GOP&rsquo;s historic gains with Hispanics. Polls show Hispanics nationwide moved 32 percentage points in the GOP&rsquo;s favor over the past three presidential elections &mdash; the nation&rsquo;s largest demographic electoral shift.</p>
<p>This trend could slow or perhaps reverse after this campaign season&rsquo;s debate over immigration, which the Republican-controlled Congress raised amid bad news of lobbying scandals and Iraq. One Democratic poll says that, for the first time, Hispanic voters rank &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; as their second-highest concern, behind immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do notice and are very aware of the mean-spirited nature of the whole debate,&rdquo; said Miami state Rep. Juan Zapata, the only Florida legislator of Colombian descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems extremists have taken this to promote their agenda. People are listening to this. And an issue like this will bear scars or good will for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harris warned the crowd that the Senate bill &ldquo;gives them more rights and privileges than you and I have. How many of you would like to only pay three of the last five years in taxes and decide which of those three you would like to do?&rdquo; The audience chuckled.</p>
<p>And she asked if it was fair for &ldquo;those illegals &hellip; to attend our universities at state resident rates? Or be entitled to years of social security that they earned illegally?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>TOUGH QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>During a question-and-answer period, McBride was hit with this: How can he say he opposes amnesty when he appeared at a May 1 march with Immigrants United for Freedom, a group that finds the Senate bill too harsh? McBride, a personal-injury lawyer and sometime-immigration attorney, said he helped people there because he&rsquo;s bilingual and knows the law.</p>
<p>Then came this question to McBride from a woman named Jackie Brownhill, a Harris volunteer who later told <em>The Miami Herald </em>that the campaign put her up to it: Why did you change your last name from &ldquo;Rodriguez?&rdquo; Brownhill later said McBride &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t look American,&rdquo; according to the <em>St. Petersburg Times.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it highly offensive. I found it to be an attack on my heritage. I was insulted,&rdquo; said McBride, noting no one in his family was named Rodriguez. &ldquo;It was something to show I was Hispanic &mdash; and that somehow it would be a negative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he acknowledges such tactics wouldn&rsquo;t be used if they weren&rsquo;t viewed as effective.</p>
<p>Democrats say this debate could have the same effect nationally that the anti-immigration Proposition 187 had in California, which inflamed Hispanics and made the state more Democratic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Prop. 187 on steroids,&rdquo; said Joe Garcia, the former executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation who now heads Hispanic outreach for the Washington-based New Democratic Network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fascinating thing is this has brought the xenophobes out of the closet. The tone is ugly and scary and it has clashed with President Bush&rsquo;s drive for openness,&rdquo; Garcia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think Bush has fought this from some of the nuts of his own party in the House? This could reverse all of his gains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2004, Bush increased his share of the Florida Hispanic vote from 49 percent to 56 percent, according to the state GOP&rsquo;s exit polling data.</p>
<p>Though Garcia says he disagrees with those numbers, he says polls point to a general Republican success nationwide when it comes to Hispanics: 40 percent voted for the Republican in 2004 compared to only 21 percent in 1996. During the same period, support for Democratic presidential candidates dropped from 72 percent to 59 percent.</p>
<p>President Bush furthered the gains with an aggressive bilingual outreach campaign that includes Spanish-fluent Gov. Jeb Bush and appeals even more to new citizens. The Democratic Network&rsquo;s polls show George W. Bush came within just four percentage points of John Kerry when it came to voters in Spanish-dominant households.</p>
<p>And some Hispanics are more conservative than Bush on immigration. Consider Eduardo Montalvo, an Osceola County school board candidate from Venezuela, who fretted in a Spanish-language paper about the &ldquo;subversive attack from the Third World [that brings] poverty, violence, crime and prostitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Montalvo was savaged for his opinions.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;if you talk about this issue, you will have problems with Hispanic voters. Hispanic voters will not support you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new poll of 600 Spanish-speaking voters from the Democratic Network bears this out, showing for the first time that Spanish-language voters are acutely concerned about discrimination and that, if a presidential election were held today, Democrats would enjoy a 36 percentage-point lead among Spanish speakers.</p>
<p>Miami state Rep. David Rivera, a top advisor to incoming state House Speaker Marco Rubio of Miami, said he&rsquo;s concerned enough that he has introduced the immigration issue at focus groups convened as part of Rubio&rsquo;s 100 Ideas forum.</p>
