<h1>Doctors Offer To Maim Beggars In TV Sting</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, August 1, 2006</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Delhi &mdash; Three Indian doctors caught on camera apparently agreeing to amputate the healthy limbs of beggars are to be questioned by the Indian Medical Council, an official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Secretly filmed footage taken by the CNN-IBN news channel and broadcast Saturday showed one of the doctors asking for 10,000 rupees (about $215) to amputate a lower leg, leaving a stump that may draw sympathySecretly filmed footage taken by the CNN-IBN news channel and broadcast Saturday showed one of the doctors asking for 10,000 rupees (about $215) to amputate a lower leg, leaving a stump that may draw sympathy &mdash; and a few rupees &mdash; from passersby.</p>
<p>He then suggests chopping off three fingers from the man&rsquo;s left hand.</p>
<p>Police said one of the three doctors had been questioned and denied the allegations, but that no arrests had been made.</p>
<p>The doctor, from Ghaziabad in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and a satellite town of the capital, New Delhi, explains how he can stitch up blood vessels in a healthy limb, causing it to blacken with gangrene over a few days.</p>
<p>A prospective beggar can be booked into the doctor&rsquo;s claiming to have had an accident, and then have the amputation carried out without raising eyebrows, he explains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me if there are two beggars in front of you and one of them is lame, you will give the money to the lame beggar,&rdquo; the station recorded him as saying in Hindi.</p>
<p>Dr Indrajit Ray, who chairs the Medical Council of India&rsquo;s ethics committee, said the three doctors would be summoned to appear before the committee later this month but was unable to say whether they were registered with the council.</p>
<p>If found guilty, they would almost certainly be permanently banned from practicing in India, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very painful situation for me as a member of the medical profession,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is most uncivilized and butcher-like activity. It cannot be supported under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The TV station sent a &ldquo;fake beggar&rdquo; along to see the doctor at his Ghaziabad clinic after hearing he offered the amputations. Their meeting was secretly filmed.</p>
<p>CNN-IBN said it was trying to expose the activities of a country-wide network of &ldquo;beggar mafia dons&rdquo; who exploit the destitute, forcing beggars working in their patch to hand over their alms, and maiming them to maximize revenue.</p>
<p>A beggar in New Delhi told the channel he had been tricked into going for a medical check-up on the promise of a job. He came round after an injection to find one of his legs missing. </p>
