<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Wadeye and Darwin, Australia &mdash; It&rsquo;s boom time in Australia&rsquo;s northernmost city, Darwin, fueled by gas pipelines and mining. But an hour&rsquo;s flight by Cessna due south, over vast wetlands and floodplains, lies the aboriginal community of Wadeye, a shantytown of about 2,500 people. </p>
<p>Cut off from the rest of the state during the wet season, many families here live 17 to a three-bedroom house. Half the population is under 15 years old and can&rsquo;t speak English. The isolation and humidity exploded this May in gang warfare involving spears and makeshift weapons.</p>
<p>With residents facing third-world conditions within a continent of plenty, some officials are calling into question decades-old efforts to introduce self-determination in aboriginal communities. What&rsquo;s needed, they argue, is a return to a form of &ldquo;paternalism&rdquo; that would appoint more capable administrators and instill a wider sense of responsibility for aboriginal communities. </p>
<p>Prior to releasing a health report on the aboriginal communities in Australia, Health Minister Tony Abbott wrote recently that self-determination was unworkable and that &ldquo;someone has to be in charge.&rdquo; He proposed an administrator with wide-ranging powers instead of the current local councils chosen with community input. Mr. Abbot wrote that self-determination had only encouraged officials to voice concern without backing it with responsible action.</p>
<p>Abbott&rsquo;s report revealed that indigenous life spans are, on average, 17 years shorter than those of the general population. He went on to write that the problem was not a lack of government spending but the &ldquo;culture of directionlessness in which so many aboriginal people live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as aboriginal affairs are concerned, this country has taken a strong stance that self-determination has led down a blind alley,&rdquo; says David Martin, an expert on aboriginal affairs at the Australian National University in Canberra. Slowly, the government is attempting &ldquo;a more practical reconciliation focusing on roads, power lines, and housing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest policy shift, Martin argues, may be unfairly scapegoating previous efforts at self-determination. &ldquo;Under self-determination, the indigenous people were lumbered with jobs they did not have adequate training for like maintaining roads so when they failed to do their work properly, self-determination was blamed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In reality, it&rsquo;s the entire state apparatus that has failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aboriginal communities are wary of a policy shift that could upend their lives. Local councils, including those in Wadeye, have been appalled by Abbott&rsquo;s remarks, saying the message harks back to a stricter time where the Christian missions had control and people were known not by their names but by the numbers on their assigned dormitories.</p>
<p>Two town elders, Nolene and Geraldine, still remember their numbers. &ldquo;I was 55 and Geraldine was 76,&rdquo; says Nolene, laughing. &ldquo;In some ways, those days were better because we had to bathe, learn English, and were fed properly. Now the men just smoke ganja and no one wants to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Terry Bullemor, CEO of Wadeye&rsquo;s local council, shakes his head at Abbott&rsquo;s remarks. &ldquo;The people are just starting to have intellectual awareness of their situation. Self-government has not been given a chance &hellip; . We are slowly moving toward giving people control, but it&rsquo;s all very confusing because the governments come and go without explaining their systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theodora Narndu, one of Wadeye&rsquo;s traditional owners, says the main problem is that residents were displaced from their homelands. &ldquo;When I move away from Wadeye, I don&rsquo;t have confidence &hellip; . I need to be with my mob on my land to be proud. Then I can take you fishing and to the best billabongs. I am in charge, you see.&rdquo;</p>
