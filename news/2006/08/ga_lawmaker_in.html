<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Decatur, Ga. &mdash; Rep. Cynthia McKinney, running late, rushes into her suburban Atlanta campaign headquarters. She&rsquo;s about to be endorsed by the 250-member Afro-American Patrolmen&rsquo;s League.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a week before a runoff between McKinney and Democrat Hank Johnson. It&rsquo;s a day after three county sheriffs and the statewide Fraternal Order of Police threw their support to Johnson. And McKinney is struggling to make her second comeback in two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the fight of her career,&rdquo; says William Boone, a political scientist at Clark Atlanta University.</p>
<p>The competition for police support stems from a March incident in which McKinney shoved a Capitol Hill officer. &ldquo;I was never charged with anything, and so it&rsquo;s not an issue,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Even so, the scuffle underscored the main issue for many voters &mdash; McKinney herself. Johnson, a low-key defense attorney and former county commissioner, understands that as well as anyone. His slogan is &ldquo;Vote Hank, Replace Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McKinney, 51, touts herself as a voice for the voiceless. &ldquo;Send me back to Washington so I can speak truth to power,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, however, she won only 47% to Johnson&rsquo;s 44% in the Democratic primary, forcing Tuesday&rsquo;s runoff. She began a cable-TV ad barrage at week&rsquo;s end as polls showed her trailing Johnson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McKinney&rsquo;s scuffle with the Capitol Hill Police officer has been a key issue. McKinney had a new hairstyle and was not wearing her congressional member pin when an officer stopped her from circumventing security at the Capitol. She later accused the officer of racial profiling and &ldquo;inappropriate touching.&rdquo; A grand jury did not bring charges against McKinney.</p>
<p>McKinney&rsquo;s conduct sets a bad example and is an appropriate campaign issue, Johnson says. A &ldquo;regular&rdquo; person who shoved a cop, he says, would have been handcuffed, fingerprinted and booked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abramowitz says many voters perceive McKinney as a mix of &ldquo;arrogance and paranoia.&rdquo; He says she has written off northern DeKalb County, a white area where he lives: &ldquo;We do not get her newsletters. She never ventures up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McKinney counters that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been the representative for everyone&rdquo; in the district, whatever their race or party.</p>
<p>Mark Davis, a &ldquo;data miner&rdquo; for the GOP, says he&rsquo;s notifying Republicans who did not vote in the GOP primary that they can vote in the Democratic runoff. He says some Republicans want to stay out of it because &ldquo;we love having a wing nut like McKinney as the face of the Democrat Party.&rdquo; Others want to defeat her because &ldquo;she is such a joke that she can&rsquo;t get much done in Congress for her constituents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McKinney scores Johnson for taking money from Republicans &mdash; including former gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner &mdash; and says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;pernicious&rdquo; that her state&rsquo;s open system allows them to vote in the runoff. &ldquo;Republicans want to pick who the Democratic leader of the 4th Congressional District of Georgia is going to be,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have endorsed McKinney, and most of her contributors are from outside Georgia. It&rsquo;s OK for them to help pick the winner, McKinney said, because &ldquo;Congress is a national office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike typical candidates, McKinney has no campaign press secretary or public schedule. She did not participate in debates before the primary. A recorded office greeting last weekend urged callers to vote in the primary July 20. The primary was actually on July 18.</p>
<p>McKinney called her event with black officers Tuesday &ldquo;very important,&rdquo; but the press was not alerted. Only CNN and USA TODAY were present, joined halfway through by a local TV station. The CNN crew was there for a prearranged interview (it never happened) and was unaware of the endorsement.</p>
<p>One of the endorsers was McKinney&rsquo;s father, a retired cop. The pair spent much of the hour discussing past and present discrimination against black police officers.</p>
<p>Boone says one reason McKinney might lose Tuesday is her focus on racial issues. Newcomers to her district, he says, are younger, middle-class blacks interested in education, jobs and taxes: &ldquo;They are not necessarily influenced by the old civil rights leadership. The demographics are changing. &hellip; We are definitely in a post-civil rights phase.&rdquo;</p>
