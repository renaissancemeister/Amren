<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=51424">Illegal Aliens Linked to Gang-Rape Wave</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea Schilling, WorldNetDaily.com, August 22, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A wave of illegal-immigrant gang rapes is sweeping the U.S. while public officials and law-enforcement authorities fear drawing the link, experts say. </p>
<p>Deborah Schurman-Kauflin, a Ph.D. researcher of violent crimes, told WorldNetDaily, &ldquo;It appears as if there is a fear that if this is honestly discussed, people will hate all illegal immigrants. So there is silence. … But in being silent about the rapes and murders, it is as if the victims never even existed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Schurman-Kauflin, who runs the Violent Crimes Institute in Atlanta, participated in a 12-month, in-depth study of illegal immigrants who committed sex crimes and murders from January 1999 through April 2006. The study found approximately 240,000 illegal-immigrant sex offenders reside in the United States – while 93 sex offenders and 12 serial sexual offenders come across U.S. borders illegally every day. </p>
<p>Schurman-Kauflin said, &ldquo;Gang rapes by illegal immigrants appear to be gang related. Many of the cases I reviewed involved gang members. As part of being a cohesive group, they offend together. Inflicting brutal gang rapes brings them closer together as a group. It is a way to demonstrate their power. And it sends a message to anyone who dares to cross them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Americans for Legal Immigration PAC told WND it now is tracking 12 gang rapes by illegal aliens within America&rsquo;s borders since Oct. 2004. </p>
<p>ALIPAC&rsquo;s president, William Gheen, said, &ldquo;These are just the ones we know of. The real number is much higher.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Gheen told WND he believes the number of gang rapes is increasing as the population of illegal aliens in the U.S. increases. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Many illegal aliens have a rape and pillage mentality toward America,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The government has shown them they can break our laws on many levels without much fear of enforcement. Why should they think of rape or gang rape any differently?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Gheen said, &ldquo;Illegal aliens are more likely to engage in these crimes because rapes and gang rapes are much more common in the gang-rule Third World areas they come from.&rdquo; </p>
<p>MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, a highly organized and well-funded Central American gang, is infiltrating at least 33 states across the U.S., according to law-enforcement authorities. The gang is well-known in Los Angeles, Houston, New York and Washington, D.C., for excessive brutality. Any person suspected of cooperating with authorities is hunted down, tortured and killed. Initiation rites include kickings, beatings and gang rapes. </p>
<p>Gheen said, &ldquo;These gangs are forcing new female gang members to undergo gang rape to enter the gang and they are asking their male initiates to gang rape American women to become an official member of the gang.&rdquo; </p>
<p>MS-13 relies on metropolitan areas with highly concentrated populations of illegal aliens to boost its spreading membership. Chapters require that initiates perform random acts of violence, such as participating in gang rapes, to gain acceptance, confirm law-enforcement officials. </p>
<p>Three MS-13 gang members were charged in the brutal rapes of two deaf girls, one 14, the other 17, in a Massachusetts park in 2002. One victim, who also suffered from cerebral palsy, was pushed out of her wheelchair before being raped repeatedly. </p>
<p>Illegal alien rapists often maintain several aliases, making escaping justice easier. </p>
