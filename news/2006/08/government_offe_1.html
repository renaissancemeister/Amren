<h1>Government Offers HIV Amnesty For Zimbabweans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anne Beston, New Zealand Herald, August 31, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> Zimbabweans who fled the Robert Mugabe regime and fear they may be HIV-positive, will be eligible for permanent residency in New Zealand even if they have the disease.<br>
 <br>
Yesterday the Government urged hundreds of Zimbabweans who fled the Mugabe regime to come forward and apply for permanent residency under a special scheme set up for them, even though part of the process is compulsory health screening.<br>
 <br>
Health Minister Pete Hodgson and Immigration Minister David Cunliffe moved to reassure the refugees their health status would not be taken into account as long as they met other standard criteria.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;We are doing this because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do to protect the health of New Zealanders and of those Zimbabweans seeking to become New Zealanders,&rdquo; said Mr Hodgson.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;When people know about their HIV status, we can be much more successful at containing the spread of the virus.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
The special residency scheme, which came into effect last year, applies to Zimbabweans who came here on humanitarian grounds before October 2004.<br>
 <br>
Of 1300 migrants, 500 had applied and 800 had not. HIV infection in Zimbabwe is around 20 per cent. Of the 500, 42 were found to be HIV positive (8.4 per cent).<br>
 <br>
Of the 800 people so far avoiding the scheme, up to 160 could be infected using the higher estimate of 20 per cent, said Mr Hodgson.<br>
 <br>
It was unlikely all would require antiretroviral treatment but if they did, it could cost New Zealand taxpayers $2.9 million a year.<br>
 <br>
There are 2474 HIV-positive people living in New Zealand.<br>
 <br>
Health status is normally taken into account when migrants apply to come here.<br>
 <br>
NZ First slammed the policy, saying the party had warned that failure to medically test migrants would lead to an added burden on the health system.<br>
 <br>
Compulsory health screening was not widely introduced until late 2004, but many Zimbabweans arrived before then.<br>
 <br>
NZ First leader Winston Peters, who is on extended sick leave in Rarotonga, yesterday said the Government did not have &ldquo;the foggiest notion&rdquo; of where the Zimbabwean migrants were and was being forced to &ldquo;coax them out of the woodwork with the bait of residency with no questions asked&rdquo;.<br>
 <br>
The Government also had no idea &ldquo;whether they are behaving like Zimbabwean refugee Shingirayi Nyarirangwe,&rdquo; he said.<br>
 <br>
Nyarirangwe was convicted in 2004 of having unprotected sex with four women. At least one later tested positive for HIV.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;The result of years of soft immigration is that these people and hundreds of other migrants will now be treated for free for the rest of their lives,&rdquo; said Mr Peters, who is also the Foreign Minister.<br>
 <br>
A spokeswoman for the Labour Department, Mary Anne Thompson, said the only way of tracking the Zimbabwean immigrants was through community meetings, Zimbabwean groups and with communications help from Government agencies. The Aids Foundation would also help.<br>
 <br>
She said the Zimbabwean situation was a &ldquo;unique and complex case&rdquo;.<br>
 <br>
Howard Andrew, a Zimbabwean who came to New Zealand in 1994 and who has since helped other migrants to settle here, said he had not heard of people dodging authorities because of HIV. &ldquo;But I can imagine it to be true in some cases,&rdquo; he said.<br>
 <br>
Zimbabweans applying under the special residency scheme must do so by February 28, next year. </p>

Hiv Ruling Raises Others&rsquo; Eyebrows<br>

New Zealand Herald, September 1, 2006<br>
 <br>
The Government&rsquo;s decision to let refugees from Zimbabwe become permanent residents regardless of their HIV status has raised questions from other refugees.<br>
 <br>
The move was a welcome humanitarian gesture, but other refugees should be given the same chance, said Refugee Council president Nagalingam Rasalingam.<br>
 <br>
He said his group had been told the annual quota for refugees with HIV was 20.<br>
 <br>
The Government says about 800 of 1300 Zimbabweans who fled Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s regime are not applying for permanent residency because they are worried they will be sent back if they fail HIV tests.<br>
 <br>
It believes as many as 160 of the 800 will be HIV-positive, which will cost the country $2.9 million a year.<br>
 <br>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said the policy for Zimbabweans showed the Government had gone soft on immigration.<br>
 <br>
Mr Peters said it had been forced to coax Zimbabwean refugees out of hiding with the bait of no-questions-asked residency because it did not have &ldquo;the foggiest notion&rdquo; where they were.<br>
 <br>
Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said the new policy was designed to make sure people were tested and treated before the disease spread.<br>
 <br>
It would be inappropriate to repatriate Zimbabweans who had HIV because of the &ldquo;awful and oppressive&rdquo; nature of the Mugabe regime, he said.<br>
 <br>
Aids Foundation executive director Rachael Le Mesurier said there were high levels of anxiety among Zimbabweans who suspected their HIV-status would lead to them being expelled from New Zealand.<br>
 <br>
NZ First deputy leader Peter Brown asked Health Minister Pete Hodgson in Parliament how the refugees had been allowed entry.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;These people were required to declare they were of good health and good character when they arrived.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
Mr Hodgson said the danger the refugees posed to New Zealanders&rsquo; health was not from people who knew they had HIV but those who did not.</p>
