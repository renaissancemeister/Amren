	<p>Judge frees part of system from U.S. desegregation oversight after 25 years</p>
<p>Chicago &mdash; After a quarter century, a judge has released portions of Chicago Public Schools&rsquo; desegregation plan from federal oversight.</p>
<p>In a decree issued Monday, U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras eliminated a set of spending and reporting requirements from the original 1980 agreement covering the nation&rsquo;s third-largest school system, which has about 431,000 students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current demographic makeup of Chicago and its student population bears virtually no resemblance to that which gave rise to litigation between the parties in the first instance,&rdquo; Kocoras wrote.</p>
<p>The changes include lifting a requirement that the school system spend nearly $100 million a year on desegregation. The school system had already committed to spending triple that, more than $300 million a year, on desegregation efforts such as after-school programs, summer school and bilingual projects, officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1980, the federal government ordered the city to desegregate its public schools, requiring it to provide additional educational services for children in racially isolated schools and to integrate to &ldquo;the extent practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>School officials have argued that integrating the entire system is increasingly difficult, given the low percentage of white students, down from 17 percent in 1980 to less than 9 percent today. The majority of the district&rsquo;s students are black and 38 percent are Hispanic.</p>
<p>Schools activists criticized the new decree as too vague, saying they feel it lets the district off the hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is quantifiable,&rdquo; said Valencia Rias of the school reform organization Designs for Change. &ldquo;Basically, CPS just has to try to do something. And that something could be anything.&rdquo;</p>
