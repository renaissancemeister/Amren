<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>High ranking detectives fear legions of foreign gangsters have a stranglehold over Reading&rsquo;s violent criminal underworld.</p>
<p>And privately, frustrated police hold the Immigration Service responsible for the takeover &mdash; claiming the agency has repeatedly refused to deport scores of dangerous villains.</p>
<p>The truth about those who control the local drug scene came to light during Operation Falcon, set up to combat the &ldquo;men of violence&rdquo; after the shocking abduction and murder of schoolgirl Mary Ann Leneghan nearly 12 months ago.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;grossly understaffed&rdquo; Falcon has made more than 1,000 arrests, at least 80 of whom were illegal immigrants heavily involved in drug dealing and controlling prostitution. Officers have also taken 310kg of class A drugs off the streets, and seized Â£250,000 in cash and assets from convicted criminals.</p>
<p>In an Operation Falcon briefing document seen by The Chronicle, a senior police officer revealed: &ldquo;I estimate that the majority of drug related crime in Reading is committed by persons who have entered the country illegally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As police we try to crack down, but we get no support from the Immigration Service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A massive immigration crackdown is required in Reading to remove these people and eradicate them from the criminal fraternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Describing the Immigration Service as being in &ldquo;meltdown&rdquo;, Reading East MP Rob Wilson, whose constituency covers some of the town&rsquo;s most notorious haunts for drugs and prostitution, said: &ldquo;The service is understaffed, overstretched and it&rsquo;s focusing on the wrong areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are violent criminals on our streets that should not be in the country, let alone in our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report identifies a &ldquo;whole raft&rdquo; of illegal immigrants currently in British jails, who police say are being ignored by the Immigration Service &mdash; leaving them free to return to their lives of crime, many to Reading&rsquo;s seedy drugs underworld.</p>
<p>The report concludes: &ldquo;If we were given proper funding and resources to tackle this problem a real difference could be made, and I have no doubt that lives would be saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Immigration Service needs to work with us not against us to remove people who are overstayers, who have entered the country illegally, or commit crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Wilson said: &ldquo;The police are struggling to deal with a system where they arrest somebody, put them in prison, and the Immigration Service cannot be bothered to track these people and deport them at the end of their prison sentences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police have identified one telling loophole because illegal immigrants cannot be deported if they do not have a passport. So many of them &mdash; particularly Kenyans, Nigerians and Jamaicans &mdash; routinely dump their passports or any form of identification.</p>
<p>Last night Immigration Service spokesman Stephen Carter said: &ldquo;Removing failed asylum seekers is still a top priority, but we are committed to taking action against illegal immigrants in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Explaining the difficulties of deporting people who, for a variety of reasons, have no travel documents, or might be tortured if they return home, Mr Carter added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we can, we remove people, but that&rsquo;s not to say we don&rsquo;t come across some barriers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Criminals back on the street</p>
<p>* Christopher Stephenson (American Johnny), arrested for traffic offences in 2005. Fingerprints were sent to Interpol and he was identified by the FBI as a felon convicted of firearms and weapons offences in the US.</p>
<p>Had previously been deported to Jamaica by the US and entered Britain on a false passport, without declaring his convictions.</p>
<p>Stopped by officers in Oxford Road in 2003 and convicted of a weapons offence.</p>
<p>In 2005 immigration officers, armed with his criminal record, detained him temporarily but released him pending a human rights appeal but vanished and cannot be traced by immigration officials. Police believe he is back in Reading dealing drugs.</p>
<p>* Last month an officer stopped Kenyan Barry Gichimu, who is linked to the Reading drug trade, driving a car with no MOT, road tax, insurance or driving licence.</p>
<p>Operation Falcon officers were told by the Immigration Service not to arrest him, even though he is a failed asylum seeker, because he had no valid Kenyan passport.</p>
<p>A note on the police file reads &ldquo;I would suggest that it is not in his interest to ever obtain one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* At the start of Falcon last year Dominic Fraser from Guyana was arrested at a crack house next to the derelict Wallingford Arms pub &mdash; from where murdered schoolgirl Mary Ann Leneghan was abducted.</p>
<p>The Immigration Service had no record of him being in Britain &mdash; meaning he got in under another name.</p>
<p>Police cautioned him for an immigration offence and he was deported &mdash; but last month Operation Falcon officers stopped him near another crack house in Oxford Road.</p>
<p>Immigration Service records show he was re-admitted to Britain on a student visa, and then married a UK national.</p>
<p>No checks had been made on his college course or marriage.</p>
