<h1>The Truth About &lsquo;La Raza&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rep. Charlie Norwood, Human Events, April 7, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s television screens many days recently have been filled with scenes of huge crowds carrying the colorful green and red flag of Mexico viewers could well have thought it was a national holiday in Mexico City.</p>
<p>It was instead, downtown Los Angeles, Calif., although the scene was recreated in numerous other cities around the country with substantial Mexican populations. Hordes of Mexican expatriates, many here illegally, were protesting the very U.S. immigration laws they were violating with impunity. They found it offensive and a violation of their rights that the U.S. dared to have immigration laws to begin with.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa mounted the podium, but any hopes that he would quiet the crowds and defend the law were soon dashed. Villaraigosa, himself, has spent a lifetime opposing U.S. immigration law.</p>
<p>For law-abiding Americans without knowledge of the dark side of our current illegal immigration crisis, all this is unfathomable. For those who know the truth about the &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; movement, these demonstrations were a prophecy fulfilled.</p>
<p>It is past time for all Americans to know what is at the root of this outrageous behavior, and the extent to which the nation is at risk because of &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; &mdash; The Race.</p>
<p>There are many immigrant groups joined in the overall &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; movement. The most prominent and mainstream organization is the National Council de La Raza &mdash; the Council of &ldquo;The Race&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To most of the mainstream media, most members of Congress, and even many of their own members, the National Council of La Raza is no more than a Hispanic Rotary Club. </p>
<p>But the National Council of La Raza succeeded in raking in over $15.2 million in federal grants last year alone, of which $7.9 million was in U.S. Department of Education grants for Charter Schools, and undisclosed amounts were for get-out-the-vote efforts supporting La Raza political positions. </p>
<p>The Council of La Raza succeeded in having itself added to congressional hearings by Republican House and Senate leaders. And an anonymous senator even gave the Council of La Raza an extra $4 million in earmarked taxpayer money, supposedly for &ldquo;housing reform,&rdquo; while La Raza continues to lobby the Senate for virtual open borders and amnesty for illegal aliens. </p>
<p>Behind the respectable front of the National Council of La Raza lies the real agenda of the La Raza movement, the agenda that led to those thousands of illegal immigrants in the streets of American cities, waving Mexican flags, brazenly defying our laws, and demanding concessions.</p>
<p>Key among the secondary organizations is the radical racist group Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan (MEChA), one of the most anti-American groups in the country, which has permeated U.S. campuses since the 1960s, and continues its push to carve a racist nation out of the American West.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MEChA isn&rsquo;t at all shy about their goals, or their views of other races. Their founding principles are contained in these words in &ldquo;El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan&rdquo; (The Spiritual Plan for Aztlan):</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the spirit of a new people that is conscious not only of its proud historical heritage but also of the brutal gringo invasion of our territories, we, the Chicano inhabitants and civilizers of the northern land of Aztlan from whence came our forefathers, reclaiming the land of their birth and consecrating the determination of our people of the sun, declare that the call of our blood is our power, our responsibility, and our inevitable destiny&hellip;   Aztlan belongs to those who plant the seeds, water the fields, and gather the crops and not to the foreign Europeans&hellip;   We are a bronze people with a bronze culture. Before the world, before all of North America, before all our brothers in the bronze continent, we are a nation, we are a union of free pueblos, we are Aztlan. For La Raza todo. Fuera de La Raza nada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That closing two-sentence motto is chilling to everyone who values equal rights for all. It says: &ldquo;For The Race everything. Outside The Race, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of these radical, anti-American, racist organizations are frequently smoothly polished into public respectability by the National Council of La Raza. </p>
<p>Former MEChA members include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who was officially endorsed by La Raza for mayor and was awarded La Raza&rsquo;s Graciela Olivarez Award. Now we know why he refuses to condemn a sea of foreign flags in his city. California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is also a former MEChA member. He delivered the keynote address at La Raza&rsquo;s 2002 Annual Convention.</p>
<p>The National Council of La Raza and its allies in public office make no repudiation of the radical MEChA and its positions. In fact, as recently as 2003, La Raza was actively funding MEChA, according to federal tax records.</p>
<p>Imagine Robert Byrd&rsquo;s refusing to disavow the views of the KKK, or if Strom Thurmond had failed to admit segregation was wrong. Imagine Heritage or Brookings Foundation making grants to the American Nazi Party. </p>
