<h1>Black D&eacute;molition</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruno Gheerbrant, American Renaissance, June 2005</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	              <p>Like 
                the rest of Europe, Bel-gium is in the process of transforming 
                itself. In Brussels, the symbol of this transformation is a neighborhood 
                not far from a big downtown intersection called Porte de Namur. 
                Long ago, the neighborhood had a Belgian name, which no one can 
                remember. Now it is known as Matong&eacute;, a street name in 
                Kinshasa, in the Congo. Over the last several decades, Africans 
                have gradually taken over.</p>
              <div></div>
                            <p>Until the early 1990s, Matong&eacute; 
                was a pleasant place to visit. African students&mdash;mostly from 
                the former Belgian Congo&mdash;gathered to socialize, and African 
                shops seemed as welcoming to Belgians as they were exotic. No 
                one was afraid of blacks. Later, Belgium, like so many other Western 
                countries, put out the welcome mat for refugees from the civil 
                wars, genocides, and tribal massacres that are tearing Africa 
                apart. The change in population led to changes in behavior. Matong&eacute; 
                has become an outpost of Africa, and the most dangerous part of 
                Brussels. Crime has spread throughout the city to the point that 
                some inhabitants now jokingly refer to their city as &#147;Bronxelles.&#148;</p>

About half the population of Matong&eacute; 
                are now foreigners: Mostly Congolese, but also Senegalese, Rwandans, 
                Burundians, Malians, etc. They hang about on the streets in such 
                numbers that they no longer feel constrained to adopt the manners 
                and customs of the country in which they live. Matong&eacute; 
                has lost what remained of its Belgian soul, and is now an overseas 
                suburb of some African metropolis, complete with petty hustles, 
                violence, and a constant state of semi-anarchy. Belgians are leaving 
                the area, and few whites venture in as visitors.</p>
              <p>If you visit Matong&eacute; you 
                will find a gigantic outdoor mural. Its style is reminiscent of 
                the propaganda posters Communists and other dictators used to 
                put up to celebrate their dogmas. This bit of Belgian propaganda 
                celebrates friendship between peoples, and especially between 
                Belgians and Africans.</p>
              <p>The Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles, a 
                little covered street off the main thoroughfare, has gradually 
                become the headquarters for African crime. Here was born an African 
                gang that took an American name, and for which brutality has been 
                its watchword. Here was born <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i>.</p>
              <p>It was on Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles 
                that on June 19, 2001, the police carried out what they called 
                Operation Alpha, an attempt to bring a little order to the area. 
                For some weeks, African gangs had been fighting for control of 
                the drug trade, first with fists, then with knives and even with 
                guns. (For Belgians knifings are practically unheard of; shootings 
                happen only in the movies.) Two weeks earlier a colored gentleman 
                by the name of Pitchoun had been stabbed in a gang rivalry. The 
                next week violence had spilled out onto Rue Saint Josse and Rue 
                Verbist, and the police picked up a collection of machetes, knives, 
                and box cutters. A few days later, a few of Mr. Pitchoun&rsquo;s 
                friends came across members of the other gang; the altercation 
                ended in yet another stabbing. The next day there were more reprisals, 
                when persons unknown lobbed two Molotov cocktails into a bar called 
                Magritte, headquarters of one of the gangs. This sort of thing 
                had to stop.</p>
              <p>The very day before Operation 
                Alpha, police noticed Africans loitering in a local park, who 
                fled at the sight of the authorities. A quick check of the bushes 
                turned up tear gas grenades, knives, and eight folding hand saws. 
                Hand saws? The police had not forgotten an earlier incident in 
                which seven members of one gang pounced on a rival in a streetcar 
                and, before the eyes of the dumb-founded passengers, nearly sawed 
                off his hand.</p>
              <p>Operation Alpha proceeded without 
                incident but without much success: The police issued a dozen summonses 
                that went nowhere, and seized a few knives and a small amount 
                of drugs. Still, it was a sign of the times. By 2001, Congolese 
                criminals were beginning to make a name for themselves. The police 
                and even the public were beginning to notice.</p>
              <p>A special police report published 
                that year revealed that many gang members had come to Belgium 
                as children in the early 1990s, accompanied by various &#147;aunts&#148; 
                or &#147;uncles&#148; who were soon out of their depth in the 
                complexities of an industrial society. Many left school, where 
                they could not keep up, and since they had no one looking after 
                them, ended up on the streets. Many were criminals by the time 
                they were age 12 or 13. </p>

              <p>The report continued: &#147;They 
                will steal a VW Golf in Brussels and drive it to Holland to buy 
                hashish. They will steal a Ford Fiesta in Amsterdam for the drive 
                back to Belgium, and if they find a girl hitchhiking they will 
                pick her up and gang rape her. They have no sense of guilt. If 
                you try to explain to them it is wrong to attack an 89-year-old 
                woman they will tell you there is nothing they can do about it 
                if the old broad won&rsquo;t let go of her handbag and has to be 
                knocked down. They are predators, true predators.&#148;</p>
              <p>The report also quoted officers 
                who complained of the constraints under which they had to work 
                because these criminals are so young:</p>
              <p>&#147;I recall one youngster who 
                had been involved in 18 crimes including a holdup at Ixelles, 
                two thefts from vehicles, a home invasion in Li&egrave;ge, and 
                a car-jacking in a discotheque parking lot between Brussels and 
                Anvers. It took us a year to nab him. The very next day, he was 
                back on the street .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#148;</p>
              <p>Another complaint: &#147;There 
                are thugs the court protects from being photographed and put into 
                our files, so we can&rsquo;t show their pictures to victims or 
                witnesses.&#148;</p>
              <p>The report noted that Congolese 
                who arrived in Belgium after about the age of eight or ten grew 
                up with an African state of mind. Some fought in the civil and 
                tribal wars in Congo, Rwanda, and Angola. Some were boy soldiers. 
                Others were born in Belgium, but that seems to make little difference. 
                As Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Van Leeuw, family court judge and expert 
                on youth gangs explains, &#147;For all of them, gangs are an identity, 
                a chance to live a life that is authentically <i>black</i>.&#148; 
                (Mr. Van Leeuw used the English word &#147;black,&#148; as do 
                many Africans living in Europe. It is a sign of the extent to 
                which aggressive American expressions of blackness influence how 
                Africans view themselves.)</p>
              <p>These young immigrants conformed 
                to a kind of ethnic constant: They quickly established social 
                structures like those of an American black ghetto or African slum, 
                forming gangs in which violence is the primary means of self-expression. 
                They live by what appears to be instinct: muggings, attacks on 
                the weak and elderly, car-jackings, rape. </p>
              <p>As Judge Van Leeuw puts it: &#147;Groups 
                like this are almost exclusively African. There are similar groups 
                of young African girls. All are characterized by extreme violence. 
                Individually, these young people can show extraordinary acts of 
                kindness. Nevertheless, they are almost all armed with knives 
                or even folding garden saws. Joining a group requires some demonstration 
                of qualifications, usually an act of violence.&#148;</p>
              <p>The first gangs appeared in the 
                early 1990s and can be traced to gatherings at which young Congolese 
                met in the evenings to dance and socialize. These parties quickly 
                jumped the tracks. Fascinated by violence and looking for ways 
                to express themselves as racial minorities, they looked to America. 
                In 1991, inspired by an American movie about New York gang wars 
                called <i>New Jack City</i>, a Brussels gang started calling itself 
                <i>New Jack</i>.</p>

              <p>Other gang names came from more 
                prosaic sources. <i>Les Finest</i> came from &#147;Finest Gordon,&#148; 
                a beer of high alcohol content sold in half-liter bottles that 
                Africans drink in great quantity. Today there are many gangs with 
                colorful names: <i>Kung Fu Klan</i>, <i>Black Wolves</i>, <i>Azewa</i>, 
                <i>Black Faces</i>, and <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i>. These 
                are not translations&mdash;they are the actual names of African 
                gangs, and show the cachet of sounding American. Influence does 
                not flow the other way; no black American gang would call itself 
                <i>Les Serpents Noirs</i>, for example.</p>
              <p>In 2001, a gang with the unlikely 
                name of <i>Les Japonais</i> (The Japanese) made a brief bid for 
                power. Two of its members made a spectacular haul when they grabbed 
                a briefcase with more than three million Euros from a businessman 
                who had just made a bank withdrawal. They pulled off the job right 
                under a security camera, so were quickly identified and caught. 
                No one seems to know why they called themselves <i>Les Japonais</i>, 
                and they were soon eclipsed.</p>
              <p>The gangs tend to be organized 
                around an individual strong man who recruits members from ages 
                13 to 20. As in the mafia, when the head of a gang is arrested, 
                an underage member comes forward to take the rap, because a minor 
                will not see much jail time. Often the youngest gang members are 
                the most reckless.</p>
              <p>The true record of the havoc <i>Black 
                D&eacute;molition</i> and other Congolese gangs have wreaked on 
                Belgian society lies somewhere in the confidential records of 
                the police. Occasionally, if the victim is elderly or treated 
                in a particularly horrible way, the crime may make its way into 
                the papers, but the names of the perpetrators are generally left 
                out. Obviously African names would give the wrong impression, 
                after all, so it takes some sleuthing for outsiders to get a grasp 
                of the extent of black crime. </p>
              <p>Gang violence is by no means limited 
                to attacks on hapless Belgians who are at the wrong place at the 
                wrong time, that is to say when a Congolese decides he wants to 
                make a few Euros without having to work for them. Among themselves, 
                and especially with rival gang members, these African predators 
                show little sentiment. Punishment of traitors and settling of 
                scores can lead to spectacular and bloody encounters. Here are 
                some of the incidents from about a six-month period that did manage 
                to make the papers.</p>

              <p>One evening in October 2001, Andy 
                Djimbo gets off the streetcar at Berchem-Staine-Agathe and sights 
                a few members of <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i>. This is a worry 
                because his people&mdash;he is a <i>New Jack</i>&mdash;have already 
                had some warm encounters with <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i>. 
                He makes a quick call on his cell phone to a buddy who promises 
                to come for him right away. He takes off down Avenue des Myrthes, 
                but his enemies catch up with him. They have sticks and knives, 
                and proceed to beat him. For extra fun, one takes out a gun and 
                holds it to his head. His friend shows up in a car just in time, 
                and Mr. Djimbo makes a break for it. He jumps into the car, which 
                takes off like a shot, but <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> is not 
                to be left empty-handed. The men chase the car all the way to 
                Rue Potaerdegat, and one fires three shots, hitting Mr. Djimbo 
                in the leg and shoulder.</p>
              <p>The <i>Black D&eacute;molition 
                </i>contingent&mdash;all 18 of them&mdash;hop on a passing bus in 
                the hope of making a getaway, but the police are already after 
                them. A quick search turns up chains and baseball bats. The firearm 
                is found under the seat of Fabrice Dimbala. It is not to be forgotten 
                that this is Belgium, where no one is allowed to own a handgun, 
                and people do not spray city streets with bullets.</p>
              <p>Just a few weeks later, on Jan. 
                11, 2002, there is another revenge attack, this time by <i>Les 
                Black Wolves</i>,<i> </i>a juvenile gang that is a kind of subcontractor 
                for <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i>. Some of its boys attack 16-year-old 
                Cedric, a member of a rival gang called <i>Black Pite</i>. They 
                stab him at Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles, and leave him for dead in 
                a pool of blood.</p>
              <p>The next month <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                pulls off a particularly rococo stunt. On a late afternoon, six 
                of its members show up at number 196 Avenue Dailly and go up to 
                an apartment on the fourth floor. They persuade 20-year-old Christophe 
                to open the door (he is to this day close-mouthed about why <i>Black 
                D&eacute;molition</i> sought his society that day), whereupon 
                they tie him up and beat him with an iron rod. It appears that 
                they are seeking information. They threaten to kill him, and finally 
                drag him out to the balcony of the apartment. The downstairs neighbor 
                hears screaming and opens the shutters. There, before his astonished 
                eyes, is young Christophe, hanging from a rope in mid air.</p>
              <p>That same month, the wife of the 
                president of Central African Republic pays a visit to Galerie 
                d&rsquo;Ixelles in the company of the wife of the Central African 
                ambassador. A <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> stalwart takes a 
                swing at them with a sword. As it happens, the ladies have a body 
                guard, who puts up a stiff resistance, but the brouhaha brings 
                out about 10 members of <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> who give 
                chase. The three Central Africans manage to take refuge in the 
                Hotel Conrad. The police make one arrest.</p>
              <p>There is more to come at Galerie 
                d&rsquo;Ixelles. On March 22, 2002, <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                rubs out one of its own members suspected of being a spy for a 
                rival gang. The murder weapon is a fondue fork. The police pick 
                up one of the killers two months later. They are already acquainted 
                with Yannick, also known as Erwynn, who likes to spook the police 
                by removing his glass eye and leering at them with an empty socket. 
                Another killer happens to be the swordsman who attacked the ladies, 
                but he is not caught until September, when he shows up in Switzerland. 
                A third stays on the lam until December when he, too, is rounded 
                up in Switzerland.</p>

              <p>But <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                really makes a name for itself on May 16. That day, thousands 
                of Belgians throng Rue Neuve, the busiest shopping street in the 
                capital. Unbeknownst to them, <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> and 
                <i>New Jack</i> are fighting over who will control the drug trade 
                in the area. Alain Ndakoze and Lutahe Okundji, both of <i>Black 
                D&eacute;molition</i>, are killing time on Rue Neuve when they 
                catch sight of several <i>New Jacks</i>. Mr. Ndakoze decides to 
                set up an ambush for them, but the <i>New Jacks</i> are too quick 
                for him. Andy Djimbo, the gentleman who just a few months before 
                stopped two <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> bullets, pulls out 
                a .32 caliber pistol and shoots Mr. Okundji in the leg. He then 
                empties his pistol wildly into the crowd. Susan McDonald, a 24-year-old 
                British tourist is hit in the leg. Panayotis D., a 21-year-old 
                Greek living in Brussels, is seriously wounded, also in the leg, 
                and is rushed to the hospital. Twenty-four-year-old Bechir D., 
                visiting from Schaerbeek, is grazed by a bullet, and Andres B. 
                from Anderlecht, age 29, is hit in the thigh. Miraculously, no 
                one is killed. </p>
              <p>In the panic that ensues, Mr. 
                Ndakoze leaps on Mr. Djimbo and takes his weapon, then hustles 
                off with his bleeding comrade, Mr. Okundji. The police show up 
                promptly, however, so he ditches the gun. The gunman is quickly 
                taken into custody. The very next day, Congolese are out in force 
                on the Rue Neuve, but so are the police. There is no more gunplay.</p>

              <p><b>Back in the Congo</b></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>One is struck by certain similarities 
                between the behavior of African gangs and that of the armed gangs 
                devastating the Eastern Congo. Particuarly in the province of 
                Iturie, killers give themselves fancy names, and it is the <i>Effaceurs</i> 
                (Obliterators) who run things. Although they pretend to give it 
                some kind of vague political justification, they have a habit 
                of indiscriminate rape: men, women, children, grandmothers, babies. 
                Anyone who makes it though the hair-raising reports Amnesty International 
                sends back from the Congo begins to wonder why the militias bother 
                to wear trousers when they are on maneuvers.</p>
              <div></div>
              <p><i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                has something of a reputation in this line, too. On the night 
                of November 16, 2001&mdash;during the same period discussed previously&mdash;Augustin 
                Pasi, Tr&eacute;sor Mutamba and Philippe Nguwa Wukendi sidled 
                up to a girl of 16 (race unspecified) waiting for the train at 
                the Louvain la Neuve Station. They talked her into following them 
                to student quarters where they put a knife to her throat and proceeded 
                to spend the night raping her. Mr. Pasi is something of a serial 
                rapist. On the night of Nov. 18, 2000, he and three other Africans 
                met three girls (again, race unspecified) at a snack bar, and 
                managed to get them into an apartment. Once inside, all four systematiclly 
                raped all three. This was not long after a group of nine <i>Black 
                D&eacute;molition</i> members talked a girl of 15 off the streets 
                of Antwerp, and took turns raping and sodomizing her.</p>
              <p>All is fair in love and war. In 
                February 2002, a girl who was having a drink with <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                suddenly lost consciousness&mdash;knock-out drops in her drink&mdash;and 
                came to only to find herself tied to a kitchen table in a strange 
                apartment, where several Africans had their way with her.</p>

              <p>Being the girlfriend of a gang 
                member is no protection. On the night of March 2, 2002, Fabrice 
                Dimbala left the Gala discotheque with his 18-year-old companion. 
                She had had enough for the evening and wanted to go home. This 
                infuriated Mr. Dimbala, who decided to teach her a lesson. He 
                invited Magatte Kobi, David Bakupa and Bayazi Mbuyi to come along 
                with him to help mete out discipline, which he began by breaking 
                one of her teeth with a vodka bottle. They spent the rest of the 
                evening beating and raping her.</p>
              <p>For <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i>, 
                2002 was The Year of the Woman. On August 13, seven members abducted 
                a woman and spirited her off to an apartment in Rue Fontaine in 
                Brussels, where they spent the night raping her. The next morning, 
                when the young victim thought her tortures were over, the men 
                bundled her into a car, drove her to the town of Charleroi, and 
                started on her again. The woman did not manage to escape until 
                three days later. This is not unusual. <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                likes to keep women for days on end, and makes them do the cleaning 
                when they are not otherwise occupied.</p>
              <p>Belgian women are sadly ignorant 
                of what they are up against. On April 19, 2003, our friend Fabrice 
                Dimbala was out with pals in the Porte de Hal area and decided 
                to snatch a handbag. The young owner, hoping to get her things 
                back, followed them into a side street where they turned on her, 
                dragged her into an apartment, and raped her.</p>
              <p>It was around the same time that 
                <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> began branching out from rape and 
                street&nbsp;crime, and started to ply its trade outside the capital. 
                In December, Bely Tshimanga, Fabrice Okitundu and Luc Gillissen 
                went to the town of Machelen where they visited a Pizza Hut. They 
                helped themselves to the contents of the cash register and quickly 
                disappeared. By the time the employees realized what had happened, 
                <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> was already on the road to Ev&egrave;re, 
                where they arrived 40 minutes later and knocked over another Pizza 
                Hut. </p>
              <p>Later that month, four gang members 
                cruised into the town of Nivelle in a stolen automobile. They 
                were broke and needed cash. About noon, armed and hooded, they 
                burst into an electronics store called Draime Electronic. One 
                gang member held a knife to the throat of the store manager while 
                another kicked a customer violently in the stomach. The gang dragged 
                the two to the back of the store and tied them up, while they 
                brandished weapons at the other customers. <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                collected wallets, cell phones, car radios, DVD readers, and 2,055 
                Euros from the cash registers, and roared off in the store manger&rsquo;s 
                Ford.</p>
              <p>Still in December, the day after 
                Christmas, six or seven members attacked a take-out restaurant 
                in Waterloo. They beat the woman behind the counter, emptied the 
                till, and tried to make her open the safe. She stalled for time 
                and they panicked, leaving with only the 650 Euros from the cash 
                register.</p>

              <p>The next day, December 27, <i>Black 
                D&eacute;molition</i> arrived at Berchem-Sainte-Agathe. Two members 
                reached into a car at a stop light, and stole purses from two 
                women. An auxiliary police officer witnessed the crime and put 
                out an alert. The next day, police saw the perpetrators back in 
                Brussels in a car with French plates and went after them. <i>Black 
                D&eacute;molition</i> escaped after a wild, high-speed chase through 
                the streets of Brussels in which, miraculously, no one was hurt. 
                Once again, Belgians were treated to sights heretofore seen only 
                in American movies. On January 9, 2003, the gang robbed a gas 
                station in the town of Lasne, drove to Overijse and hit another 
                gas station.</p>
              <p>In April of 2004, <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                moved on to bigger things when two of its members abducted an 
                executive in the Brussels office of the Congolese diamond mining 
                company, Mini&egrave;re de Bakwanga. They were acting on orders 
                of Jean-Charles Otoko, a former Congolese foreign minister and 
                former officer of the company. He is suspected of having stolen 
                $80 million from the firm, $20 million of which he spent on weapons 
                in Ukraine and the Czech Republic to get around the arms embargo 
                on the Congo. The remaining $60 million are thought to have come 
                to rest in private Congolese hands. The abduction appears to have 
                been some murky score-settling.</p>
              <p>The petty thugs from Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles 
                had, it seemed, come to the attention of highly-placed Congolese 
                officials who seem to have discovered kindred spirits on whom 
                they could rely for certain delicate operations.</p>

              <p>The police are finally putting 
                some of these criminals behind bars. In February 2004 they caught 
                up with the men who went on the year-end tear in 2002, in which 
                they hit Pizza Huts and gas stations all over Belgium. Sentencing 
                standards are far different in Belgium than in the United States: 
                Of the seven defendants, one got seven years, but several got 
                off with just three.</p>
              <p>In March 23, 2004, it was Bely 
                Tshimanga-Kazadi&rsquo;s turn. This 20-year-old <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                veteran, in the dock in Brussels along with a dozen confederates, 
                was charged with seven rapes. Six of his victims were minors; 
                one was just 13. He was also up for a car-jacking and several 
                holdups. When the time came for the accused, in accordance with 
                Belgian law, to speak for himself, Mr. Tshimanga glared at the 
                judge, a woman, and explained:</p>
              <p>&#147;The police are always coming 
                around Porte de Namur looking for blacks. But it&rsquo;s not just 
                blacks who like group sex. Whites and Asians do too, and in my 
                case it was all consensual. Group sex may seem strange to you, 
                Your Honor, but you&rsquo;re just too old to understand. Anyway, 
                I don&rsquo;t have to rape to have sex. I&rsquo;m plenty good-looking 
                enough to find a woman.&#148;</p>

              <p>As the judge begins to read the 
                sentence, Mr. Tshimanga exploded. He shot out of his chair screaming, 
                and threw himself at the judge. The police were on him in an instant, 
                but it took a ferocious struggle to control him. Everyone in the 
                courtroom thought peace had been restored, but at the first opportunity, 
                Mr. Tshimanga went on the offensive again. This time all the other 
                <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> members erupted with him, lashing 
                out at whoever was handy. The women in the courtroom were frozen 
                in terror&mdash;they had heard what these men were capable of&mdash;while 
                the defense lawyers, who had spent enough time with their clients 
                to get to know them, fled for safety. The blacks started swinging 
                chairs and benches. Fifteen more officers rushed to the courtroom, 
                where there was a general melee. Order was finally restored, and 
                <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> got its sentences: ten years for 
                Bely Tshimanga and Magatte Kobi, eight for Stefan Ngueudong, Gu&eacute;lor 
                Litanda, Andry Bandazio, David Bakupa, and Bazayi Mbuyi, seven 
                years for Lutahe Okundji, Frederic Kani, and Yves Mbena, six years 
                for Prince Lusungi and Fabrice Okitundu, five years for Frederic 
                Kani and Kaseba Kabamba.</p>
              <p>As they are marched out of court, 
                one of the men shouted, &#147;We&rsquo;ll see you in hell and then 
                you&rsquo;ll pay!&#148;</p>
              <p>Fabrice Dimbala, who was finally 
                sentenced in January 2005, has been part of our story from the 
                beginning. He was the <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> member under 
                whose seat on the bus was found the pistol used to blaze away 
                at the unfortunate Mr. Djimbo. It was he who decided to teach 
                his girlfriend a lesson when she wanted to go home rather than 
                keep the party going, and he was also one of the purse-snatchers 
                who raped the victim when she tried to get her property back. 
                He was up for two gang rapes and three attempted murders, and 
                got 13 years in prison. His lawyers were shocked. &#147;A jail 
                sentence must have some meaning and must lead to rehabilitation, 
                but in this case the punishment is incomprehensible,&#148; said 
                one. &#147;This is why we will undoubtedly appeal.&#148;</p>
              <p>Mr. Dimbala is one of these black 
                criminals who fascinate liberal journalists, Belgian and American 
                alike. The young thug was apparently a first-rate soccer player. 
                He had already made a name for himself in a first-division amateur 
                league, and was a sure bet for spot on a pro team. &#147;Only 
                19 and facing 13 years in prison,&#148; moaned the press. &#147;What 
                a waste. What could have driven him to crime?&#148; What, indeed?</p>

              <p>In May 2004, no less a personage 
                than Nicole Mar&eacute;chal, Belgian cabinet minister for Aid 
                to Youth, was at Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles to hear young Congolese 
                speak for themselves. She heard that Congolese parents don&rsquo;t 
                do enough for their children, but that ultimately the fault lies 
                with the Belgians. There are no positive black role models in 
                Belgium as there are in France or the United States, and blacks 
                are society&rsquo;s chosen victims. &#147;Most of us,&#148; said 
                one Congolese, &#147;feel that whichever way this country is going, 
                it is going without us. We are the fall guys in this country, 
                and the government doesn&rsquo;t do for us the things it does for 
                other immigrant groups.&#148; And that, the young Congolese explained, 
                was why they join gangs. They crave a thousand things they cannot 
                afford, and fall under the influence of Africans older than themselves 
                who are already completely alienated from Belgian society. </p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p><b>White Demolition</b></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be a mistake, of course, 
                to suppose that <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> is a problem unique 
                to Brussels. There have been extremely violent gangs in France 
                for more than a decade, and they have appeared whenever immigration 
                from Africa reached a certain level. In Switzerland, where the 
                murderers of Okito Djunga took refuge, Africans are heavily involved 
                in the drug trade. In Quebec, increasingly active gangs of blacks 
                terrorize the population. Nor is the problem limited to French-speaking 
                countries. In London, black gangs are such a problem that Trevor 
                Phillips, the black head of the Commission for Racial Equality, 
                recently suggested that black boys be put in separate classes 
                (see May issue.)</p>
              <p>In the United States, of course, 
                the theory has always been that black gangs of super-predators 
                were the fruit of centuries of slavery and prejudice, but 40 years 
                of racial preferences have not brought notable improvement. In 
                Europe, where blacks have immigrated voluntarily, they find themselves 
                in exactly the same situation and are clamoring for the full panoply 
                of quotas and preferences.</p>
              <p>In Africa itself one finds even 
                worse gangs. Contrary to all predictions, the end of Apartheid 
                in South Africa has not led to peace but to an explosion of violence 
                of all kinds. In Congo, Liberia, Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, 
                and Rwanda, armed gangs in a state of alleged civil war prey on 
                civilians as much as they fight each other. The black gangs in 
                Belgium, with their violence and sadism, are a kind of social 
                constant independent of geography or social or historical circumstances. 
                It could have been predicted with complete confidence that they 
                would appear once the African population reached a certain number. 
                </p>
              <p>Why, then, have Belgian politicians&mdash;like 
                politicians in all European countries&mdash;been unable to take 
                the bull by the horns, to stop this immigration, and protect their 
                populations from predation? At least in the case of Muslims, the 
                events of September 11 forced even the most deluded optimists 
                to see that throughout Europe, these people do not want to assimilate; 
                they want to rule.</p>
              <p>It is perhaps with blacks that 
                the European elite maintains, to some degree, a genuinely colonialist 
                mentality. Our rulers came of age when there were still African 
                empires, and when Europeans still claimed their goal was to civilize 
                the savage. Politicians today seem to think they can go the previous 
                generation one better: If civilization could not be brought to 
                Africa, they can bring Africans to Europe and make them into good 
                little Belgians and Frenchmen. What we now see before our eyes&mdash;in 
                the streets, on public transport, in the crime figures&mdash;is 
                proof that Africans do not become Belgians or Frenchmen. It is 
                when they are in gangs that they most brutally assert their differences 
                from us, but the gangs themselves are only the tip of a huge iceberg 
                of irreconcilable differences that our elites&mdash;blinded by 
                Eurocentrism&mdash;are determined to ignore.</p>

              <p>Of course, our elites, just like 
                the Communist <i>nomenklatura</i> who insulated themselves from 
                the realities of the worker&rsquo;s paradise, are indifferent to 
                the destruction of European society because they can escape its 
                consequences. The French Socialist politician Lionel Jospin is 
                a perfect example. For years, he preached multiculturalism and 
                promoted full-bore immigration. When he finally withdrew from 
                politics in 2002 after an unsuccessful run for the presidency, 
                he did not retire to a mixed-race neighborhood of the kind he 
                did so much to bring about. He doesn&rsquo;t even live on the French 
                mainland, but on a chic little island called Ile de R&eacute; 
                off the coast, in the Bay of Biscay. No non-white neighbors for 
                him.</p>
              <p>The Africans of <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> 
                are responsible for their crimes, but they are not responsible 
                for having committed them in Belgium. Others&mdash;Belgians&mdash;are 
                responsible for that. It is the politicians, the intellectuals, 
                and the media personalities who are to blame. They are members 
                of a far more dangerous gang: <i>White D&eacute;molition</i>.</p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p><b>D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu</b></p>
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Belgian authorities do not 
                seem to have noticed that what they are going through very much 
                resembles the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. That was when 
                crime rates&mdash;among blacks in particular&mdash;began to soar, 
                and there was no shortage of theories about how society was to 
                blame. Jail sentences were short because prison was for rehabilitation. 
                It took 20 years before Americans learned that the only thing 
                that rehabilitates career criminals is old age, and that the best 
                thing to do is simply keep them away from the rest of us. Now 
                that most states have stiff sentencing guidelines, we have a larger 
                prison population, but crime rates have been dropping for a decade. 
                </p>
              <p>The sentences the Belgian courts 
                have handed out to <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> thugs are jokes 
                by American standards. The lawyers for Mr. Dimbala, the soccer 
                prodigy, were shocked when their client got 13 years for two gang 
                rapes and three attempted murders. An American court would probably 
                have given him 30 years to life. We are certainly capable of unlearning 
                our lessons, but Americans have had their fill of catch-and-release. 
                </p>
              <p>The Belgian view of crime is typical 
                of all-white, European societies. The country has traditionally 
                had violent crime rates one third to one quarter of those in the 
                United States. It has had the occasional sensational crime, but 
                is not accustomed to the casual brutality and indifference to 
                suffering that characterize many black criminals. It is only now 
                discovering the horrible things of which certain 12 and 13-year-olds 
                are capable, and has not yet adjusted its juvenile code. Many 
                American states now prosecute child-pimps and child-murderers 
                as adults.</p>
              <p>If Belgians do not stop the flow 
                of immigrants, they will be forced through the same, painful adjustment 
                as the United States. It remains to be seen whether they will 
                recognize in time that <i>Black D&eacute;molition</i> does not 
                reflect inadequacies of Belgian society but results from the presence 
                of Africans in a civilization built by Europeans.
