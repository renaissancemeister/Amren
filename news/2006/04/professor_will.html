<h1>Professor Will Debate Magazine Editor on U.S. Hispanics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexa Garcia-Ditta, Shorthorn (University of Texas-Arlington), April 27, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanicization and changing American demographics will dominate a debate Friday. </p>
<p>Political science professor Jose Gutierrez and Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance magazine, will battle over the increasing Hispanic population in the United States at 1 p.m. in the University Center Rosebud Theatre. Gutierrez will be speaking in favor of the growing U.S. Hispanic population, while Taylor argues in opposition. </p>
<p>The event, sponsored by the College Republicans, is free, said Diana Witherspoon, organization president and marketing junior.</p>
<p>She said the discussion will help more students get involved in politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our campus is apathetic when it comes to politics,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for all UTA students to get involved. UTA is very diverse, and getting involved brings a lot to the table as far as being a well-rounded student.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brian Boothe, psychology graduate student and debate organizer, said he feels bringing the views of Gutierrez and Taylor to campus is a way to heal growing cultural and racial problems.</p>
<p>Some of these problems include self-segregation, an increase in crime rate and disparity in academic performance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor, a graduate of Yale University, said he will be speaking against the Hispanicization of America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the fun, but I&rsquo;m wondering how anyone is going to describe it as a good thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Jose Angel Gutierrez, Texas Civil Rights Review, April 25, 2006</i></font>

						<p>No this is not a match between two boxers or wrestlers; it is a debate at the University of Texas-Arlington campus on April 28, 2006 at 1pm at the Student Center, Rosebud Theatre. It is free and open to all the public. </p>
<p>I am debating Jared Taylor, a racist in a suit. Look at his writings for the past 14 years under www.amren.com He believes that the first white persons that came to North America were &ldquo;pioneers&rdquo; and &ldquo;nation builders,&rdquo; not illegal aliens. </p>
<p>I say the first illegal aliens in the US were the pilgrims, his forefathers. I believe that the first illegal aliens in Texas were Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, and thousands of other criminals. He believes that they were freedom fighters and heroes. </p>
<p>Taylor also has racist views about certain people. White people are good and intelligent by nature. Blacks and browns (Latinos) are criminal by nature. Mexicans and other Latinos are invading the US and destroying the white way of life, he writes, says, and believes. </p>
<p>Come hear him. To him and his supporters, the US has been a white country, still is a white country, and should remain a white country. I believe this is a nation of immigrants and we should all accommodate each other and live peacefully as human beings not racial groups. </p>
<p>Mexico lost these lands we now call Texas and the Southwest in wars of aggression fought by the US in the early to mid-1800s. Political control over these lands transferred over to the US and our problems began. Overnight we were made illegal and unwanted in our own homelands. That is still the case today. </p>
<p>The Taylor&rsquo;s of this country believe we should not come into the US unless we become like them. In the case of African Americans who were brought here in chains and into slavery, the Taylor&rsquo;s of this country believe they are inferior and cannot become like them. In our case the Taylor&rsquo;s believe we are not only different in our culture but deficient because we are not white. </p>
<p>I realize you probably do not believe such people exist today but they do and I am having this debate in public to expose this racist in a suit on April 28th at 1pm. If you cannot come, go read his material. Taylor and others are daily on the air on radio and television talking bad about Mexicans, immigrants and me in particular. I think we need to answer them back in public.</p>
