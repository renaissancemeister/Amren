<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Good Samaritan has spoken of his disgust after a dying man was heckled by yobs.</p>
<p>Travis Marshall, 42, tried in vain to save an elderly driver who had a heart attack at the wheel and careered into a bus.</p>
<p>But as the victim took his last breath, sick youths in tracksuits and hoods clashed with police and yelled: &ldquo;He is just a white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Marshall, who performed emergency CPR on the man in St James&rsquo;s Road, Bermondsey, last Friday, said: &ldquo;It was sickening. Here you had a dying man, people trying to save him and police trying to clear the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there were these black youths and all they wanted to do was fight the cops. They were saying, &lsquo;You think I am scared of you because of your uniform&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them to have some respect because a man was dying and they shouted, &lsquo;Who cares &mdash; it&rsquo;s just a white man&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Marshall told how a black woman next to him pleaded with cops to arrest the youths.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;These people should be ashamed to walk the streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would try to help someone whatever their colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t print what I really think of them. They are scum &mdash; scum of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Marshall was driving for a quiet weekend with sister Terry Choeb at her home in Peckham when he arrived at the crash scene at 4.20pm.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;People were just standing around. The man was bleeding from the mouth and was hardly breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talked to the ambulance service on a mobile while checking the man&rsquo;s pulse, but when it started to fade he made the decision to lift him from his car and lie him on the road.</p>
<p>Mr Marshall, a former private ambulance driver, then tried to give the kiss of life. Paramedics arrived 10 minutes later but could not save him.</p>
<p>Mr Marshall, formerly of Peckham Rye but now from Canterbury, Kent, said: &ldquo;It is sad, but all you can do is your best.&rdquo;</p>
