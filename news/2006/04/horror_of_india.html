<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4903390.stm">Horror of India&rsquo;s Child Sacrifice</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Navdip Dhariwal, BBC News, April 12, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In India&rsquo;s remote northern villages it feels as if little has changed. The communities remain forgotten and woefully undeveloped, with low literacy and abject poverty. </p>
<p>They are conditions that for decades have bred superstition and a deep-rooted belief in the occult. </p>
<p>The village of Barha in the state of Uttar Pradesh is only a three-hour car drive from the capital Delhi. Yet here evil medieval practices have made their ugly presence known. </p>
<p>Lured with sweets </p>
<p>I was led by locals to a house that is kept under lock and key. They refuse to enter it. </p>
<p>Peering through the window bars you can see the eerie dark room inside, with peeling posters of Hindu gods adorning the walls and bundles of discarded bed clothes. </p>
<p>In one corner is the evidence we had come to find: blood-splattered walls and stained bricks. </p>
<p>It is the place where a little boy&rsquo;s life was ritually sacrificed. </p>
<p>Those who tortured and killed Akash Singh did so in a depraved belief &mdash; that the boy&rsquo;s death would offer them a better life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman who did this was crazed,&rdquo; the villagers say. &ldquo;Akash was friends with all our children &hellip;  We still cannot believe what happened here.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Akash&rsquo;s distraught mother discovered her son&rsquo;s mutilated body. The family was told he was lured away with sweets and begged his captors to set him free. </p>
<p>&ldquo;First they cut out his tongue,&rdquo; his grandmother Harpyari told me. &ldquo;Then they cut off his nose, then his ears. They chopped off his fingers. They killed him slowly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&lsquo;Profiting from fear&rsquo; </p>
<p>The woman who abducted Akash lived just a few doors away. She claimed to be suffering from terrible nightmares and visions. </p>
<p>It was then she turned for guidance to a tantric, or holy man. It was under his instruction that she brutally sacrificed the boy &mdash; offering his blood and remains to the Hindu goddess of destruction. </p>
<p>There are temples across India that are devoted to the goddess. Childless couples, the impoverished and sick visit to pray that she can cure them. </p>
<p>Animal sacrifice is central to worship &mdash; but humans have not been temple victims since ancient times. </p>
<p>We were met with a hostile reception at the temple in Meerut. The high priest did not want us to see the ritual slaughter. </p>
<p>Tantrics like him clearly have an overwhelming grip on their followers. Often they are profiting from people&rsquo;s fears. In extreme cases others have instructed their followers to kill. </p>
<p>Crackdown campaign </p>
<p>S Raju is a journalist for the Hindustan Times and has been reporting on child sacrifice cases since 1997 in western Uttar Pradesh. He has reported on 38 similar cases. </p>
<p>In one incident he says a tantric told a young man that if he hanged and killed a small boy and lit a fire at his feet the smoke from the ritual could be used to lure the pretty village girl he had his eye on. </p>
<p>He has been campaigning for a crackdown on the practice of tantrics, alarmed at what he has seen. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The masses need to be educated and dissuaded from following these men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They play on people&rsquo;s fears and superstitions &mdash; it is crazy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Unreported </p>
<p>We visited the jail where those accused of murdering Akash were being held. </p>
<p>The prison warden told us of over 200 cases of child sacrifice in these parts over the last seven years. </p>
<p>He admitted many of the cases go unreported because the police are reluctant to tarnish the image of their state. He told us incidents of child sacrifice are often covered up. </p>
<p>Many of those killers are behind bars &mdash; but, chillingly, others poisoned by the same sinister beliefs remain at large.</p>
