<h1><a href="https://www.sundaytimes.co.za/Articles/TarkArticle.aspx?ID=1976826">Aspirant Farmers Reap Ruin</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Prega Govender, Sunday Times (Johnnesburg), April 2</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eight years ago La Boheme was the envy of Limpopo&rsquo;s mango farmers.</p>
<p>Situated in Trichardtsdal, neighbouring Hoedspruit and Tzaneen, which is collectively the country&rsquo;s biggest mango-producing area, the 450ha farm boasted an annual turnover of about R3-million.</p>
<p>At the time, La Boheme&rsquo;s owner, Leon Bondesio, built a palatial double-storey house on the farm with sweeping views of the Drakensberg escarpment.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs bought the farm for R4.5-million and handed it over to 383 aspirant black farmers as part of the national land reform programme.</p>
<p>The initiative, known as a Settlement and Land Acquisition Grant (SLAG), made available a grant of R16000 per household, so that residents could pool their money to buy a farm.</p>
<p>The purchase of La Boheme by the then Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs, Derek Hanekom, was lauded in Parliament through a notice of motion congratulating Hanekom for &ldquo;signalling&rdquo; the ANC-led government&rsquo;s commitment to implement a land redistribution policy.</p>
<p>But today, La Boheme&rsquo;s mango orchards, comprising around 50000 trees, are untended and overgrown with dense alien vegetation. The double-storey house, which was to have been converted into an upmarket lodge, has been stripped bare. </p>
<p>Bit by bit, the new owners removed the ceilings, doors and windows, using the timber for improvements to their informal dwellings and for firewood.</p>
<p>All that is left of the once thriving commercial farm&rsquo;s equipment are three broken tractors and a rusty plough.</p>
<p>The farm, which is administered by the Calais Communal Property Association (CCPA), has never made a profit since it changed ownership &mdash; and is now worth a mere R920000.</p>
<p>La Boheme is among 71 unproductive farms in Limpopo, bought under the SLAG scheme, that are now being targeted by the province&rsquo;s MEC for Agriculture, Dikeledi Magadzi.</p>
<p>She admitted to the Sunday Times this week that the government&rsquo;s SLAG scheme had been a &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of these farms are lying barren. We admit our mistake and indeed we will be able to correct this mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said her department had recently started the process of stripping farmers who were not interested in farming of their ownership rights.</p>
<p>Magadzi described her observations during her visit to eight farms in Tzaneen and Waterberg as &ldquo;very disgusting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one of the farms there were dry mango trees, which tells you that no one bothered to water them. At another farm, I saw tractors that had &lsquo;collapsed&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging farmers told her that borehole machines and tractor parts had been stolen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have room for lazy farmers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My message to them is to ship out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Magadzi admitted that one of the major reasons for the collapse of the farms was the lack of funds for input costs, mechanisation and capital projects.</p>
<p>La Boheme ran itself into the ground because of bitter infighting among beneficiaries and a lack of knowledge and expertise about farming.</p>
<p>The farm&rsquo;s first manager, Ori Manthata, was booted out after eight months over allegations that he stole R48000.</p>
<p>Manthata subsequently cleared his name after successfully suing the CCPA for defamation of character. He was awarded R70000 in damages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I left the farm there was about R130000 in CCPA&rsquo;s bank account,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never stole a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This week he was stunned to discover that the bulk of the farm&rsquo;s assets had disappeared.</p>
<p>Among the assets he claimed were still on the farm when he left were six tractors, a four-ton truck, two ploughs, three trailers and three expensive bakkies.</p>
<p>During his short tenure as manager, he harvested mangoes worth R63000 and cultivated tomatoes and baby marrows worth R42000.</p>
<p>Now, except for about 15 beneficiaries battling to eke out a living by planting mealies on tiny plots, production on the farm has come to a halt.</p>
<p>After Manthata left, beneficiaries, impatient at not receiving any benefits, chopped up the ceilings and gouged out the window frames of the house.</p>
<p>He said the actions of the owners made him ashamed to be one of the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the farm was bought, I thought my dream had finally come true. But now the place is a complete mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blamed the farm&rsquo;s collapse on bad management and owners who were not willing to &ldquo;put in an honest day&rsquo;s work&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A beneficiary and an executive member of the CCPA, Hamilton Mangena, 28, admitted that beneficiaries lacked the skills and experience to run the farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need large amounts of money from the government to turn it around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mangena said they had received summons from the Land Bank demanding payment towards a debt of R1.1-million.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries told him to his face that they had removed items from the farmhouse because &ldquo;it was their share&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said the farm was useless to them because it was not making a profit,&rdquo; Mangena said.</p>
<p>The chairman of the CCPA, Patrick Matjokotja, blamed the government for the farm&rsquo;s collapse, saying the beneficiaries had not been trained to run it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beneficiaries are not interested in farming,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Another owner of La Boheme, 62-year-old Joseph Moagi, said production stopped because the farm had no money. &ldquo;Workers cannot work on the farm if they don&rsquo;t get paid,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Theo de Jager, chairman of the land affairs committee at Agri-SA, blamed the farm&rsquo;s failure on poor management, the lack of a business plan and beneficiaries displaying apathy towards the running of the farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks after La Boheme was transferred to the new owners, the farm experienced a fire. One of the owners told me he would not be able to fight the fire because it was a Sunday and there was a big soccer match.&rdquo;</p>
