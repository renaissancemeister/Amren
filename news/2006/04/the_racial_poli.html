                video of the Cabrini Green incident.</a></p>
              <p>Cabrini 
                Green in &#9;Chicago is one of the most notorious housing projects 
                in the country. Horrific crimes by blacks against blacks are fast 
                and frequent. Some make the national news, as in the 1997 case 
                of &#147;Girl X,&#148; a young black woman who was savagely and 
                repeatedly raped, beaten, forced to drink gasoline, strangled 
                with her own T-shirt, and eventually left for dead in a stairwell. 
                She survived, but lost the use of her hands. A fellow Cabrini 
                resident, Patrick Sykes, got a 120-year sentence for the crime.</font></font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The welfare and degeneracy of 
                Cabrini make it the perfect incubator for a flourishing drug trade. 
                There are no whites in these buildings, with the exception of 
                the police officers who run up and down the stairs chasing dealers, 
                and the occasional &#147;walkup&#148; or &#147;roll through&#148; 
                by white addicts looking for drugs. Unlike Hispanic gangs, which 
                defend their territory against all comers, black narcotics dealers 
                are under orders from the top not to hurt white clients. People 
                who fear for their lives do not make good customers, and for black 
                gangs money trumps everything.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Lately, Cabrini Green has been 
                less violent than it used to be, but only because, in desperation, 
                the city reduced the population by sending many residents to some 
                unlucky suburb. Still, as a country fellow might say, a half bag 
                of rattlesnakes is still a bag of rattlesnakes. The residents 
                are not shy about calling the police when they need help, but 
                they sometimes ambush responding officers with sniper fire.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">This, then, was the scene of a 
                standoff a year ago between the police and members of the &#147;Crazy 
                Crew,&#148; which produced a media frenzy and the standard city-government 
                reaction when the crooks are black and the police are white: hang 
                the cops out to dry. This is the inside story of what happened, 
                and it is dedicated to the nation&rsquo;s hard-working police officers 
                who are tired of race-baiting, and of being treated as expendable 
                garbage by politicians.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The Crazy Crew is the Cabrini 
                Green faction of the Gangster Disciples or GDs, who were once 
                the nation&rsquo;s largest street gang. The very capable Larry 
                Hoover used to run the gang&mdash;which controlled more territory 
                than Al Capone ever did&mdash;and even after his 1974 conviction 
                for murder, he kept it going quite efficiently from his jail cell 
                in Joliet State Prison. Only after 1997, when the authorities 
                caught on to what was happening and transferred him to Terre Haute 
                Federal Penitentiary in Indiana, did the Disciples start falling 
                apart.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The GDs used to control killing 
                and drug dealing in a centralized, scientific way, but now there 
                is no organization beyond the block level. Most of the Crazy Crew 
                were kids back in the Hoover era, but they filled the vacuum at 
                Cabrini Green.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">It is April 17, 2003, approximately 
                10:30 p.m. The police have their eye on a van filled with known 
                drug traffickers. This is a Chicago neighborhood near Cabrini 
                Green that does a booming drug business, and police have just 
                seen a typical hand-to-hand transaction: Another known gang member 
                handed a brown paper bag to one of the men in the van. The police 
                roll up and officers recognize Rondell &#147;Nightfall&#148; Freeman, 
                the alleged shooter in two homicides, and Antonio &#147;P.M.G.&#148; 
                (Playa&rsquo; Money Gangsta&rsquo;) Parker, the named offender in 
                an aggravated battery of a police officer (he punched the arresting 
                officer in the face and got away, though the police recovered 
                narcotics and a gun). The officers can see these men only through 
                the front windshield because the other windows are heavily tinted.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The van pulls into Cabrini, which 
                could not have been better laid out for drug dealers if they had 
                designed it themselves. There are only two ways in, and the gangs 
                can monitor these easily while they do their business. There are 
                wrought-iron fences that keep the police from driving straight 
                up to the doors, so it is easy to make a hand-to-hand and disappear 
                into a building. For added tranquility, the gangs sometimes make 
                a false 911 call to a different part of town to divert the police. 
                This means uninterrupted business for at least 20 minutes. With 
                the lookout system, they almost always know the police are coming, 
                and this time is no exception. Someone in the van probably phoned 
                ahead.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The van stops, but the occupants 
                refuse to get out. Hundreds of project residents gather, surrounding 
                the police and the van. The police immediately call for backup, 
                yelling &#147;10-1! 10-1!&#148; (Officer in need of immediate 
                assistance.) over the radio. Police units start flying in. A sergeant 
                arrives, and officers keep the area around the van clear.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Under these uncertain crowd conditions, 
                you don&rsquo;t want to risk trouble by arresting everyone, so 
                the sergeant starts negotiating with the driver, Rondell Freeman. 
                The sergeant tells the group he wants only Antonio Parker, the 
                man who punched an officer, and if he comes out peaceably, the 
                rest can go home. Mr. Freeman&rsquo;s response? &#147;F**ck you!&#148; 
                </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Part of the problem is the van&rsquo;s 
                tinted windows. Tints are illegal in Illinois, because an officer 
                doesn&rsquo;t know if someone inside is pointing a Tek 9 or a fully 
                automatic &#147;street sweeper&#148; shotgun at his head. In any 
                case, these gangsters usually have something to hide. The van 
                is shut up tight as a clam; the driver&rsquo;s side window might 
                have rolled down a crack once or twice</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Residents start throwing rocks, 
                cans, bricks, and bottles from the high floors of the surrounding 
                buildings. These are the same people who call the police every 
                day. &#147;Baby&rsquo;s daddy just jumped on me and I have a stomach 
                ache.&#148; &#147;I want him locked up, he stole my Link card 
                (used to collect welfare payments).&#148; Police also get a lot 
                of calls about violations of orders of protection, which are restraining 
                orders on people accused of domestic battery. Many men cozy back 
                up to their women, and everyone forgets about the order of protection 
                until the man spends the welfare money on booze or cocaine. Some 
                women suddenly remember the order and call the police if they 
                catch their man cheating. Now we are all the enemy.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">A lieutenant arrives on the scene. 
                The negotiations with the men in the van go on while the crowd 
                grows. Even a guy in a wheelchair comes out to have a look. It&rsquo;s 
                still raining cans of corned beef hash, and the mob is getting 
                out of control. Fights are flaring up between residents, and the 
                police have to use force to arrest some of them. The lieutenant 
                calls for more assistance citywide. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The negotiations take 30 to 45 
                minutes, which is an amount of time astonishing only to anyone 
                not a Chicago police officer. There is an unwritten policy in 
                the department for handling situations like this&mdash;white officers, 
                black criminals, crowds of hostiles&mdash;very carefully. If the 
                least little thing goes wrong, there will be a stink and heads 
                can roll. All the officers know that if there is a hullabaloo 
                the higher ups will not hesitate to fire officers if they think 
                that will quiet angry blacks. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In this case, the men in the van 
                are going to have to come out one way or another. The police alternatively 
                beg, plead, insist and demand, until they are convinced nothing 
                short of force will do the job. </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">The lieutenant tells his men to 
                break into the van. An officer smashes a window, and police fire 
                pepper spray into the vehicle. Other men break more windows, both 
                so they can see inside and so the offenders can breathe. Officers 
                reach in through the broken windows and open the doors, igniting 
                an uproar from the mob and the people hanging out of the buildings. 
                More debris come sailing down on the police. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The scene is one of great confusion. 
                No one in the van follows directions. The passengers have to be 
                dragged out of the van, and if you have to get close enough to 
                a felon to drag him out of a car, there is no telling what he 
                may do. You don&rsquo;t know what weapons he may have, and you 
                must assume his sole purpose is to maim or kill you. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The officers order the four men 
                to lie down on their stomachs, with their hands behind their backs 
                so they can be cuffed. There are four or five officers for each 
                man, and some resist more than others. &#147;Nightfall&#148; Freeman, 
                the first man out of the van, is putting up the biggest fight. 
                Several officers have him on his stomach, but he refuses to do 
                as he is told. He is lashing out with his arms and legs, kicking 
                and squirming, and appearing to reach for his waistband. He is 
                known to carry a knife and maybe even a gun. Officers have to 
                assume he is going to pull out a gun and shoot them all. There 
                are no second chances or do-overs in police work; only trips to 
                the hospital, funerals&mdash;or successful arrests. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">One or two officers start punching 
                and kicking Mr. Freeman. There is a simple logic here: Once he 
                has suffered enough he will do what the officers are shouting 
                at him to do. All the men in the van understand this: Lie still 
                and let the police cuff you, and the pain will stop.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In this case, the officers want 
                to be out of there as quickly as possible. With a Cabrini Green 
                crowd at their backs anything could happen. Now that white officers 
                have manhandled blacks, someone in the buildings might even open 
                fire.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The officers have to be persuasive 
                with Mr. Freeman. They could inflict more pain if they used batons, 
                but there are too many officers and they are too close to each 
                other to get a good swing without hitting each other. They aim 
                their kicks and punches at his sides, arms, and legs, and are 
                careful not to hit him in the head. He finally does what he is 
                told, and the officers cuff him. They get him to his feet, and 
                hustle him into a paddy wagon driven by Officers Joseph Groh and 
                Bryan Vander Mey. They drive him across the street to the 18th 
                District station. </font></p>

                and whether they want to go to the hospital. They all say &#147;no.&#148; 
                However, a quick-thinking sergeant knows better. There is no telling 
                what injuries these felons could claim later, and he sends them 
                to a local hospital for pepper spray decontamination and an injury 
                check. A doctor finds no injuries, and signs a document saying 
                so. The Police Department sends an evidence technician to take 
                pictures. Again, there are no signs of injury. (It is best to 
                take pictures without too much warning. Suspects may bite their 
                lips to get blood and smear it around, or puff up their cheeks

                rocks and bottles. The commander doesn&rsquo;t want any trouble, 
                and orders the men to take only defensive action. He is as afraid 
                as anyone of a racial beef. The canine units go out to protect 
                the patrol cars, which the mob would love to burn. The officers 
                arrest a few people on misdemeanor charges, but no police are 
                injured, no cars are damaged, and the station is safe. The crowd

                the video here</a></b>] of the arrests at Cabrini Green, taken 
                from an upper floor of one of the buildings. The station ran the 
                video without the sound track; they wouldn&rsquo;t want to expose 
                their audience to a mob of blacks calling the police &#147;white 
                b**ches&#148; and &#147;white devil mother f**kers.&#148; The 
                news also failed to mention that everyone in the van had criminal 
                records, and was resisting arrest after more than a half-hour 
                of negotiation. The newscasters all mentioned Rodney King. </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">The then-Chicago Police Superintendent, 
                Terry Hillard (he is black, but it hardly matters) proclaimed, 
                without the need for any investigation, that &#147;a little more 
                than excessive force was used&#148; and that &#147;I have viewed 
                the tape, and I am personally upset about what I have seen.&#148; 
                He goes on to say: &#147;The Chicago Police Department has worked 
                too long and too hard in all our communities to build very strong 
                relationships with our residents. These types of incidents undermine 
                that relationship.&#148; At this point we have the typical switch, 
                and it is now the police who are on trial and the criminals who 
                are &#147;victims.&#148; In Superintendent Hilliard&rsquo;s defense, 
                he has never taken a stand for any copper under the gun, so why 
                should he start now?</font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">In the video, it doesn&rsquo;t 
                look as though Mr. Freeman is having a good time (see the video 
                at www.amren. com). However, if you pick a fight with the police 
                and decide not to do what you are told, you open yourself up to 
                some nasty moves, and it is all totally by the book. There is 
                no such thing as &#147;half way&#148; in police use of force, 
                and it is either warranted or it isn&rsquo;t. If you put up a fight, 
                it&rsquo;s warranted. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In all the classic videos, including 
                the one of the arrest of Rodney King, look closely: Mr. King gets 
                the stick only when he makes a move. The officers are telling 
                him to lie still and he refuses. That is why they were acquitted 
                at their first trial. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In the case of the Los Angeles 
                cops, it was President George H.W. Bush who panicked after the 
                city went up in flames and told us the officers were guilty despite 
                the verdict. The police in Chicago did not need the President. 
                They had a police chief to tell the world they were guilty. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">After the King incident, the LAPD 
                switched to the &#147;swarm&#148; method of gang-tackling an offender 
                to subdue and cuff him. That is supposed to be more humane than 
                clubbing him. At Cabrini, the police had to get up close to the 
                criminals and had no choice but to swarm them, but that is not 
                the method they prefer. Why not? Because the first officer in 
                the swarm stands a good chance of being punched in the face, and 
                not many officers want that kind of punishment. The academy gives 
                us better advice: Distance equals shielding. If possible, use 
                the baton, because if you can reach the felon with your stick 
                he probably can&rsquo;t reach you with his fist.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">In the Cabrini Green video, Mr. 
                Freeman gets nothing like the number of strikes Mr. King did, 
                but that makes no difference. You haven&rsquo;t signed a contract 
                with the thug who is fighting you. There is no agreement that 
                says, &#147;OK, after five strikes&mdash;fist or baton&mdash;you 
                promise to go down, and quietly let me put the cuffs on you; any 
                violation of the rules can result in serious litigation!&#148; 
                Sometimes it takes more than five strikes&mdash;maybe a lot more. 
                The armchair quarterbacks of the courtroom and the mayor&rsquo;s 
                office should have to go out into the wild with the cops, and 
                see what it is like dealing with some of the world&rsquo;s problem 
                people. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">How the politicians react to an 
                incident like this depends to a huge extent on factors that have 
                nothing to do with what an officer actually did. The most important 
                is how much media coverage there is, and whether there is a race 
                angle. A video tape that can be made to look like &#147;racists&#148; 
                in action&mdash;and that gets a lot of air time&mdash;is about the 
                worst thing that can happen to an officer.</font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">Mr. Freeman filed a complaint 
                with something called the Office of Professional Standards (OPS), 
                and the city chose the two officers who drove him to the station, 
                Joseph Groh and Bryan Vander Mey, to take the fall. On June 1, 
                2003, OPS charged them with &#147;discharging pepper spray without 
                permission,&#148; and with &#147;battery&#148; of Rondell Freeman. 
                In fact, it is not entirely clear they even did the things they 
                are charged with, since the only evidence was probably filmed 
                from ten floors up, and is not much clearer than a &#147;Bigfoot&#148; 
                video. There is a pile of people, and there are some kicks and 
                punches, but it&rsquo;s not at all clear who anyone is. There was 
                so much chaos at the scene that not even the other officers are 
                entirely sure who was doing what. The sergeant says he had pepper 
                spray in his eyes, and the lieutenant says there were men at the 
                scene he did not recognize.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">As for spraying pepper without 
                permission, technically that&rsquo;s true. However, it is so common 
                to use pepper under circumstances like these, the lieutenant wouldn&rsquo;t 
                have thought twice about it. This is the sort of charge you get 
                in a political case. The local media said the police used &#147;tear-gas 
                grenades.&#148; This is pure sensationalism. Chicago police carry 
                pepper dispensers on their belts similar to the ones the public 
                can buy.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Later, the District Attorney even 
                brought criminal charges against Mr. Vander Mey for which he is 
                likely to go on trial, but first a word about the Office of Professional 
                Standards. The department already had something called the Internal 
                Affairs Division, which looks into officer misconduct, so a second 
                bureaucracy wasn&rsquo;t necessary. The OPS was set up to improve 
                community relations&mdash;probably to please blacks&mdash;and encourages 
                the public to call if someone has a problem with the police. This 
                means OPS has become the perfect tool for anyone who wants to 
                stir up trouble against the police. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">This, needless to say, includes 
                criminals, and if they have a cell phone chances are they have 
                the OPS number on their speed dial. Often, when an officer makes 
                a simple traffic stop, the driver is already on the phone to OPS 
                before the cop can make it to the driver&rsquo;s side door. Even 
                a completely baseless complaint&mdash;the huge majority&mdash;means 
                time-consuming paper work, and any working Chicago police officer 
                can expect to &#147;do paper&#148; on at least one complaint every 
                other week. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">It is because of groups like OPS 
                that officers have to list the race of everyone they stop. OPS 
                says these statistics will affect only a small percentage of officers, 
                but &#147;affect&#148; means disciplinary measures. The message 
                is simple: &#147;Write up too many minorities and we&rsquo;ll drop 
                the hammer on you.&#148; These groups have never heard of racial 
                differences in crime rates. </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Of course, the statistics also 
                list Hispanic criminals as &#147;white,&#148; which artificially 
                inflates the white crime rate, and makes blacks look less crime-prone 
                than they are. Statistics are a wonderful thing in the hands of 
                publicity-conscious administrators. An attempted murder can miraculously 
                become an aggravated battery, and a &#147;hate crime&#148; can 
                become a mere assault. As most any cop will tell you, a crime 
                is a &#147;hate crime&#148; only when the perpetrator is white 
                and the victim is a minority. All it takes is the click of a mouse 
                to sanitize an entire district, but even after all possible adjustments, 
                blacks are still the most serious offenders, and Chicago still 
                leads the nation in homicides. </font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">The OPS has its own agenda. Lori 
                Lightfoot, black head spokesman for the office, went on a black 
                public access television program called &#147;The Munir Muhammed 
                Show&#148; and listed the names of the officers under investigation 
                in the Cabrini case before there were any official findings. This 
                is against policy, but the police department would not dare reprimand 
                a prominent black for this blatant violation.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">On the program, Miss Lightfoot 
                failed to mention a little investigation carried out by representatives 
                from OPS, Internal Affairs, and the State&rsquo;s Attorney&rsquo;s 
                Office. They visited &#147;the gym&#148; in Chicago&rsquo;s police 
                academy, where officers learn use of force guidelines, and showed 
                the famous video to the officer in charge. He quickly determined 
                that it showed standard procedure, not police brutality. He told 
                them the &#147;victims&#148; were, in fact, assailants. The witch-hunters 
                didn&rsquo;t want to hear this, so they went to the man&rsquo;s 
                immediate supervisor, who just happened to be a black woman. She 
                would certainly give them the answer they wanted. Wrong! She agreed 
                with the first officer. Nothing more has been heard of these opinions, 
                and both the officer and the sergeant have since been transferred 
                out of their jobs at the gym. Rumor has it that Miss Lightfoot 
                took her video (without the colorful soundtrack) to the Cook County 
                State&rsquo;s Attorney, but was laughed out of his office.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">None of this came up on &#147;The 
                Munir Muhammamed Show,&#148; where Miss Lightfoot was clearly 
                trying to fuel the racial fire and create a name for herself in 
                the black community. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">One curious fact in this case 
                is that Officers Vander Mey and Groh stayed at their jobs for 
                seven months after the Cabrini incident. If the department really 
                thought they were violent, run-amok officers&mdash;and all the 
                brass had seen the tape&mdash;they would have been off the street 
                immediately. At a minimum, they would have gone to a center that

                suspect or injured officer can take and still be paid. Cops call

                who work in callback have even killed people&mdash;justified or 
                not.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">But no, the Cabrini officers continued 
                to work. Watch commanders continued to fill their gang activity 
                reports with information about the Crazy Crew. The reports regularly 
                mentioned Rondell Freeman as its leader. Members of the Crazy 
                Crew were the main suspects in a series of home invasions in the 
                Cabrini area, but the residents were afraid to testify about what 
                they saw. Watch commanders continued to warn us that these men 
                fight the police, so we were to use extreme caution around them.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Rondell Freeman, the &#147;beating&#148; 
                victim, was arrested again on Jan.16, 2004, for violating bail 
                bond and for a weapons charge, after he was stopped for a tinted-windows 
                violation. Once again, Mr. Freeman would not get out of his car. 
                A sergeant had to be called in, but this time he got out without 
                a fight. Officers found a push dagger in plain view on the floor 
                of the car, where he had been sitting. They also found a group 
                of bullet holes below the passenger-side airbag. From the tight 
                grouping, it looked as though they were probably made with an 
                automatic weapon. </font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">While he was being processed at 
                the station, Mr. Freeman threatened the arresting officers, saying 
                he had a &#147;working relationship&#148; with Internal Affairs 
                (IAD), and that he could have the officers transferred out of 
                the district. Mr. Freeman had a visitor&rsquo;s pass to IAD in 
                his possession, which suggests the department had called him in 
                for a nice talk. Mr. Freeman has since been locked up again, for 
                getting into a fight at a nightclub. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Another passenger in the van in 
                the Cabrini incident was Adam Sanders. He has since been jailed 
                for stealing a truck. After he crashed the truck, he got out and 
                fought police officers, so he faces multiple charges of aggravated 
                battery, too. In an act of great creativity Mr. Sanders is suing 
                the department, claiming false arrest in retaliation for the famous 
                April 17, 2003 incident&mdash;as if the police slid a stolen truck 
                under his body. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">There were other unsung developments 
                in the case. While the police had their hands on the Cabrini incident 
                van, they ran a search for a &#147;trap.&#148; This is a hidden 
                compartment built into a vehicle for storing weapons, drugs, etc. 
                They are hard to find, because it may take a sophisticated sequence 
                to open one&mdash;like turning on the air conditioning full blast 
                while tuning the radio to a specific frequency. In fact, there 
                was a trap in the van, but it was empty. In Chicago it is a misdemeanor 
                to have a trap in your car, but by the time police found it, the 
                case had blown up so big the top brass probably figured they&rsquo;d 
                be accused of planting the trap in the car if they publicized 
                it. No charges were filed.</font></p>

              <p><font size="3">In February, a Chicago paper ran 
                another scathing article about police &#147;racism.&#148; It was 
                a collage of stories, but the two main ones were the Cabrini incident 
                and one about a Chicago firefighter who allegedly said &#147;nigger&#148; 
                over the radio. The point was to taint all the stories with the 
                &#147;N word,&#148; and a creative newspaper artist can easily 
                link stories like this to &#147;200 years of oppression and slavery.&#148; 
                By then Chicago had a new police superintendent, a white man named 
                Phil Cline, and this was too much for him. Two weeks after the 
                story, on March 2, 2004, he suspended Officers Vander Mey and 
                Groh without pay. The department had officially named their scapegoats.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The internal, administrative investigation 
                had gone nowhere because there was so little to build a case on, 
                but when there is enough media pressure prosecutors can build 
                a case against just about anyone. On June 3, 2004, the Cook County 
                DA charged Mr. Vander Mey with four counts of &#147;official misconduct 
                by a police officer,&#148; alleging that he assaulted the &#147;victim,&#148; 
                Rondell Freeman, while he was handcuffed. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">This was more than even the media 
                had bargained for, and the papers noted that it was &#147;unprecedented&#148; 
                for an officer to face criminal charges in an incident that produced 
                no injuries. However, when a society is rotting, the latest outrage 
                is always &#147;unprecedented.&#148; When the media kick up a 
                fuss and race is involved, the &#147;unprecedented&#148; should 
                never be a surprise. In any case the accusations are preposterous. 
                Observers say no officer struck Rondell Freeman after he was handcuffed. 
                </font></p>
              <div align="left"></div>
              <p><font size="3">(Actually, there is nothing in 
                the use of force protocol that says an officer can&rsquo;t strike 
                a man after he has been cuffed. You may be in cuffs and on the 
                ground, but if you are kicking officers, you are fair game for 
                wrist locks, arm holds, baton strikes, and punches. If you have 
                an officer&rsquo;s neck in a leg lock, he has grounds even to shoot 
                you. Most officers probably wouldn&rsquo;t, but they have to make 
                split-second decisions, and a mistake can be fatal.) </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In any case, the main purpose 
                of the indictment is to pacify blacks and maybe even ensure the 
                re-election of State&rsquo;s Attorney Dick Devine. The rumor among 
                police officers is that the word to charge Officer Vander May 
                came straight from Mr. Devine himself. Rumor also has it that 
                his subordinates warned against bringing such a weak case. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">There are other signs there is 
                nothing to this case. Despite all the media hype, Jesse Jackson, 
                who lives right in Chicago, hasn&rsquo;t moved a muscle. Johnnie 
                Cochran&rsquo;s main office is in Chicago, but he has been quiet, 
                too. You can be sure he would be all over this case if he smelled 
                money.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Even the DA knows he has a lousy 
                case. Several times, he has offered to let Mr. Vander Mey plead 
                to misdemeanor battery of the lightest kind&mdash;it would carry 
                no jail time, and would be expunged from his record if he kept 
                out of trouble. Mr. Vander Mey has refused to plea bargain, partly 
                on principle, partly for practical reasons. He is convinced he 
                is being railroaded simply for doing his job and has nothing to 
                apologize for. Also, even a no-jail-time, no-record misdemeanor, 
                which would not be a handicap for most people, would be a big 
                problem for a police officer. It would be grounds for dismissal, 
                and he wants to stay with the force.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The fact remains that Officers 
                Vander May and Groh have been suspended without pay since March 
                2, 2004. They are not even at the non-emergency call center. Mr. 
                Vander May&rsquo;s police administrative hearing has been put off 
                until after his criminal trial, and <i>that</i> could drag out 
                for another year. No trial date has been set. Mr. Groh&mdash;likewise 
                on leave without pay&mdash;is still subject to administrative hearing, 
                but his seems to have been put on hold, so he is in limbo.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">In the meantime, these two officers 
                are off the payroll. An indicted cop has a hard time finding work 
                in his usual line of business, but Mr. Vander Mey managed to scrape 
                up a part-time job. With charges pending he can&rsquo;t carry a 
                weapon&mdash;not a pleasant situation for an officer who has put 
                away a lot of Chicago criminals and who is now famous. </font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Now, for the crime of leaving 
                the station to help officers in need, he faces four counts of 
                felony &#147;official misconduct.&#148; He doesn&rsquo;t have many 
                options. For a Chicago cop, a jury trial is suicide, so he will 
                go before a judge. Many jurisdictions allow a case that has already 
                been prejudged in the press to be relocated to a different jurisdiction, 
                as was done with the cops who arrested Rodney King. This has never 
                happened in Cook County. </font></p>

              <p><font size="3">Needless to say, cases like this 
                send police morale straight to the bottom. If a man can face jail 
                time for doing his job, it makes cops hesitate when they are on 
                the street, and that can put their lives at risk. Even many of 
                the bosses are disgusted. Officers Vander Mey and Groh join a 
                long list of cops who have been thrown to the dogs because they 
                did their jobs, and the media blew it up into a racial incident.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">The politicians and police brass 
                will do anything to avoid controversy, especially if there is 
                the slightest whiff of anything that could be call &#147;racism.&#148; 
                It is easier to sacrifice the little guys than do what&rsquo;s 
                right. Politicians stare at the crystal ball and try to predict 
                how the public will act. For the men on the force, it is a question 
                of guts; and they think the politicians don&rsquo;t have any. And 
                that is why you get the levels of crime, and contempt for the 
                police from blacks that you see all over this country.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3">Carl Sandburg famously called 
                Chicago the &#147;hog butcher of the world.&#148; The stock yards 
                moved out long ago, but the city continues to live up to its name. 
                Blacks still like to call police &#147;pigs,&#148; and any officer 
                who takes his job seriously knows that every assignment could 
                be his turn to be run through the meat grinder. </p>
