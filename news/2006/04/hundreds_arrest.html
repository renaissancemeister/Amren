						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; Immigration agents arrested seven executives and hundreds of employees of a manufacturer of crates and pallets Wednesday as part of a crackdown on employers of illegal workers.</p>
<p>Authorities raided offices and plants of IFCO Systems in at least nine states, the culmination of a yearlong criminal investigation, law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested seven current and former IFCO Systems managers on charges they conspired to transport, harbor and encourage illegal workers to reside in the United States for commercial advantage and private financial gain, said Glenn T. Suddaby, the chief federal prosecutor in Albany, N.Y., where some arrests were made.</p>
<p>ICE spokeswoman Jamie Zuieback confirmed an unspecified number of raids and arrests, but declined to provide additional details because the investigation was continuing. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity because numbers were still being tallied, said the arrests were in the hundreds.</p>
<p>Raids took place at several locations in upstate New York and in Biglerville, Pa., Charlotte, N.C., Cincinnati, Houston, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Richmond, Va., and Westborough, Mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE has no tolerance for corporate officers who harbor illegal aliens for their work force. Today&rsquo;s nationwide enforcement actions show how we will use all our investigative tools to bring these individuals to justice, no matter how large or small their company,&rdquo; said ICE chief Julie Myers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>German-based IFCO Systems describes itself as the leading pallet services company in the United States, focusing on recycling millions of the wooden platforms used to stack and move all manner of goods. It operates about five dozen facilities nationwide and has been expanding steadily, according to the company&rsquo;s Web site.</p>

															Gov&rsquo;t Going After &lsquo;Systematic&rsquo; Immigration Violators 
						</div>
										<p>

										<p>
						<p>The federal government said it arrested 1,187 people on charges stemming from illegal immigration in Wednesday&rsquo;s raids &mdash; more than the total number of immigration violators arrested in 2005. And it&rsquo;s going to get worse for &ldquo;systematic violators,&rdquo; Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Thursday. </p>
<p>Chertoff called Wednesday&rsquo;s raids in multiple states the &ldquo;largest single worksite enforcement operation against a company in American history.&rdquo; Those arrested include managers and former managers who hired undocumented workers. </p>
<p>Chertoff said the investigation is continuing &mdash; and the government&rsquo;s enforcement effort is expanding. He said the strategy is aimed at &ldquo;the infrastructure that permits illegal work to take place in the United States.&rdquo; </p>
<p>According to Chertoff, the government is looking at organizations that promote the &ldquo;harboring and hiring&rdquo; of undocumented workers, and those organizations will be viewed &ldquo;in the same way we look at other criminal organizations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The strategy has worked against other organized crime groups, he said. &ldquo;And that means that what we&rsquo;re focused on is not just individual cases involving a single violator here or a single violator there, but actually looking at those people who adopt, as a business model, the systematic violation of United States law.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Chertoff said the government plans to &ldquo;come down as hard as possible and break the back&rdquo; of those organizations.</p>

					<p>This is just window-dressing to make it look like the Bush Administration takes enforcement of immigration laws seriously.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know if the illegal aliens arrested deported or released into the community pending a hearing of some kind.  If they are still in the <span class="caps">U.S., </span>released on bond pending a hearing as to their status, this is all smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE has no tolerance for corporate officers who harbor illegal aliens for their work force.&#8221;</p>
<p>One way to show that is to put any criminal trials of company executive on a fast track.  Don&rsquo;t be surprised if, in a couple of months, the company just pays a fine.  (Cost of doing business.)</p>

					<p>This isn&rsquo;t real  &mdash;  -this is political theater.  Even Administration stalwarts like Michelle Malkin and the bloggers at National Review Online spent today scoffing at this charade  &mdash;  -they&rsquo;re not dumb enough to believe a &#8220;new era&#8221; in immigration enforcement and border security has been inaugurated.  No one, Republican or Democrat, in government wants the immigration laws enforced  &mdash;  -period.  Citizens are going to have to exercise self-help to deal with the problem, starting at the ballot box.</p>

					<p>Why the sudeen turn around? Because Bush wants amnesty and he knows the public knows that he won&rsquo;t enforce the borders as he promises to do if he gets an amnesty through congress. So they&rsquo;re doing this as a public relations (deception) gambit to convince the public that the government will get tough on border security.<br>
We know he won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Myers and Chertoff propose adding 200 more enforcement agents to investigate employers in 2007.<br>
Why not now, if this is a national security issue? Because it&rsquo;s all a PR campaign. And 200 more agents will not be added in 2007. </p>
<p>Oh, and Mr. Tough Enforcement Chertoff, what did you do with the 1,100 illegals you arrested?<br>
 </p>

<p>RK:  Well, I guess I could be sarcastic and say I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it, but there&rsquo;s something about this guy that convinces me he&rsquo;s a doer and not a talker. But he&rsquo;s still under the control of El Georgio the Cluless.</p>
<p>Overall, I don&rsquo;t know at this point if he&rsquo;s going to be good or bad for securing the country, but I do know he&rsquo;s done more in the short time he&rsquo;s been in charge than that spineless fop Tom Ridge did for his entire term, which, I guess, really wasn&rsquo;t hard to beat, because his priority was searching aged granmothers and grandfaters and taking away their toenail clippers so everybody would feel safe.  </p>
<p>Asa Hutchinson is another creep that should be coaching a boy&rsquo;s softball team rather than trying to do the work required of a tough, dedicated politician. </p>
<p>If the Idiot Prince would allow Speedy Gonzalez to start prosecuting all of the employers who hire illegals, that would be a good start towards securing our country, but we still need a wall or triple fence on the border, along with about 20,000 more border patrol agents, in order to control who comes in.</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s a smoke screen if we ever saw one. After 20 years of no enforcement, a few token arrests are made to show the public that the government is now getting serious about hiring illegals. At least we know not to be fooled.</p>

					<p>This is great to hear and I certainly hope it continues but it&rsquo;s still sad and frightening that a story like this is <span class="caps">NEWS.</span> How far must we have clearly lost our way to get to the point where such a seemingly redundant execution of law enforcement would appear to be a major &#8216;crack-down&rsquo; on crime?</p>
<p>We ultimately need to get to the point where a story like this is <span class="caps">NEWS </span>as often all the traffic stops on a given day are <span class="caps">NEWS.</span><br>

					<p>Yeah, right, let us see the follow-through on prosecution, conviction, fines and time served. Wanna bet this is smoke-and-mirrors?</p>
<p>There are <span class="caps">THOUSANDS </span>of these operations/businesses in America so there should be reports of this day after day. But watch, this will be the only one.</p>
<p>It is like the Tax Audit Theatre. The <span class="caps">IRS </span>finds a flagarantly guilty tax evader, in early April, and arrest them on prime time. They have the hand-cufs, the &#8220;IRS&#8221; on their jacket backs, the big black Chevy Tahoes, etc. You know the drill. It is done to frighten us wage slaves into being good sheep. THen you hear nothing of it until the next April.</p>
<p>I feel the same will happen here. They sure can&rsquo;t keep hundreds of known illegals in Jail. They can&rsquo;t come up with <span class="caps">HUNDREDS </span>of immigration attorneys, so the illegals are let out &#8220;on their own oaths&#8221; - in Spanish - and they go get a new job down the road.</p>
<p>The company owners get their $450 a hour legal punks to get them off and we are back where we started. This is all done to put the American fool back to sleep.</p>

<p>It was amazing to listen to those idiots on fox whether this was legal.The same network where Tyson Chicken the notorius importer of illegal labor advertises. Need to call Bill o&rsquo;reilly and ask him if fox news should refuse advertisment from companies who hire illegal aliens.Maybe fox news can be charged with aiding and abetting illegal immigration.Who I really feel bad for is Caddilac.

					<p>The illegals were released and given a court date.  This is total farce.  Another transparent PR stunt by the Bush administration.  Remeber a few years ago, they did this at several Walmarts when the illegal immigration issue was heating up in the media.  </p>

					<p>This is a step in the right direction. Maybe bigger businesses will get the message. I still say fine and jail these executives and put them in cells with the meanest and nastiest cons they can find. Confiscate their businesses and properties. Then maybe the word will get out that the feds mean business. I have no sympathy for thes execs. They&rsquo;re willing to sell their country out for a few bucks.</p>

					<p>Perhaps La Raza now has one more reason for keeping illegals at home on May 1st.  All I can say is it is about time the federal government did something.  The fact that they could so easily arrest thousands at one plant suggests that they could arrest millions if they actually decided to enforce the law.</p>

					<p>News from Houston April 20th, all the illegals in Houston were released within 5 hours of the arrest with a citation to appear at a deportation hearing sometime in the next few months.</p>
<p>As a step in the right direction, some of the managers were arrested and we can look forward to a hearing in which they present the copies made of the forged SS cards, Dr&rsquo;s licenses and green cards the illegals used.</p>
<p>As long as the employee has some sort of identification and the employer keeps copies of it, nothing is done to the employer.</p>

					<p>This morning I woke with the sun and went for a four-mile run along the waterfront. The air was warm, my muscles were loose, and with easy strides I partook of the scenery  &mdash;  purple shrubs, yellow forsythias, and pink and white blossoms on fruit trees surrounding tidy well-kept houses, intermixed with the deep blue of the water. No cars with booming stereos thump-thumped by me; no screaming sirens interupted my thoughts  &mdash;  it was a beautiful, peaceful spring day, and I knew the rest of the day would be just as gorgeous and flow by just as smoothly.<br>
And now, here at the end of the day I read this story, and I smile. So much of the &#8220;race news&#8221; we read on this site is discouraging or negative, including many of my own posts. But I&rsquo;m optimistic this amnesty will never fly, and even if it does, we will know who the traitors of our country are. Many on this site predict the coming of a second Civil War, and I believe amnesty would guarantee it.<br><br>
But does anyone truly believe the Anglo Saxons will go down in defeat?<br><br>
Even of this I am optimistic.<br><br>

<p>How long can America be internally strong if we have this number of people ready, willing, and able to protest at the command of their masters? This new slave class doesn&rsquo;t seem intent on remaining slaves for much longer.</p>
<p>What we saw at those protests does not bode well for the <span class="caps">US.</span> Maybe people in power are taking notice. Maybe. I hope.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument that Chertoff means business, do you actually think this country can be saved?<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t it seem like we&rsquo;ve passed the point of no return? </p>
<p>From my own standpoint I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. Chertoff could have begun these symbolic raids (aside from the Wal-Mart one) long ago and far more numerous than the literal two or three of the work site enforcement crackdowns. </p>
<p>I do think that the million Mestizo march made a big impression. The pictures didn&rsquo;t lie, and I think that many in White America awoke. This was the first that many heard of Aztlan and reconquista. Those placards telling us that we were the illegal immigrants really insulted and infuriated the White masses. My point is these phony Republicans started getting irate phone calls from constituents demanding that something be done. I think that&rsquo;s the reason for the show today.</p>
<p>The politicians fear that Whites may <span class="caps">FINALLY </span>take matters in to their own hands. In that anti-illegal rally in Alabama some woman brought her special flag (Confederate maybe?) in honor of the last <span class="caps">CIVIL WAR </span>and in response she said &#8220;to the future civil war.&#8221;  I think the pretend conservatives are worried their days of looting and bribe taking are coming to an end, and plan on stringing us along until after the next election.  Then the amnesty can safely pass.</p>

					<p>If Bush and his cronies were serious about deporting illegals, they could have round them up right from the streets during the illegals&rsquo; protests.</p>
<p>Quite conspicuously, <span class="caps">ICE </span>was staying away from the marches. This fact alone tells the whole story.</p>
<p>My point is: don&rsquo;t buy Bussh&rsquo;s cheap tricks that are supposed to confuse you about his real intentions. And he real agenda is to see to it that the mass illrgal human traffic through the Southern border moves smootly and unobstructedly.<br>

					<p>If you believe after the big &#8220;sting,&#8221; that the illegals will show up for a court date, I have some bridges I&rsquo;d like to sell you. This photo-op was exactly that. <span class="caps">ICE </span>will rest on its laurels and that will be it. Stay on the phones and computers, gang. The vacationers will be back next week to put the lid on this farce. They need to sit down with knowlwdgeable people who can discuss things other than jobs &#8220;no Americans will do.&#8221; How about the incidences of diseases (the mumps epidemic), the gangs (do we give amnesty and citizenship to the M-13&rsquo;s?) The overcrowded schools, the situation at our hospitals, the depletion of our natural resources, the breakdown of our infrastructure? Does anyone in Washington care about these things? Or do they just decide on who gets the cheap labor and who gets the votes? They will be deciding the future of your children. Frosty Wooldrisge is urging everyone to write the President on May 1. Demand that our borders be secured with troops, our immigration laws enforced and all sanctuary cities<br>
be outlawed. We saw the illegals and their supporters turn out in force. Can we do any less? And let&rsquo;s support the Minutemen in their effort to build a fence on private land if our do-nothing government does nothing.</p>

All illegals arrested in Houston <span class="caps">TX. </span>during the great <span class="caps">ICE </span>pr effort were released within 5 hours.</p>
<p>Dozens of illegal immigrants arrested, released in hours<br>
<span class="caps">KHOU</span> 11 Houston ^ | April 20, 2006 | Vicente Arenas</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a crackdown Wednesday and dozens of illegal immigrants were arrested. </p>
<p>Many of those same immigrants were released just hours later </p>
<p>It was the last thing they, and their families, expected. </p>
<p>&#8220;They are not criminals. All they&rsquo;re here for is to work for their family,&#8221; said Mariz Gomez. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they were doing making wooden pallets at two different locations when federal agents swooped in and took nearly 70 suspected undocumented workers to this federal detention center in north Houston. </p>
<p>&#8220;Just for them to come in here and to just throw them back to where they go. That&rsquo;s not right for them,&#8221; said Gomez. </p>
<p>Families 11 News spoke with feared the men mostly from Central American countries would be deported. </p>
<p>But that was hardly the case. </p>
<p>Just five hours later Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents began releasing the undocumented workers. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was surprised by the quick release,&#8221; said a man who asked that his face not be shown. Several others made the same request. </p>
<p>It is not clear why these immigrants were released so quickly but workers say it may be because the 950-bed facility was severely overcrowded. </p>
<p>The workers say they were told the facilities were full. Sources inside the facility say the same thing and that agents have been ordered to release immigrants as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Some of the workers say there were other problems Wednesday. </p>
<p>They said computers went down and agents had to scribble information, in one case, failing to write in a court date altogether. </p>
<p>The men we spoke with promised to show up for their immigration hearings, still finding it hard to believe they were released so soon.<br>

<p><span class="caps">IFCO </span>worker speaks out after arrest [ICE Raid - New York]<br>
capitalnews9 ^ | 4/20/2006 | Danielle Strauss</p>
<p><br>
Posted on 04/20/2006 1:08:13 PM <span class="caps">PDT </span>by ncountylee</p>
<p><br>
A nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrant workers netted some arrests in the Capital Region on Wednesday. And now, one of the workers is speaking out about the raid. </p>
<p>All the men are either from Honduras and Mexico and have been living at a home on Western Avenue   &mdash;   a home they said <span class="caps">IFCO </span>provided for them for about $50 a week. </p>
<p>While many of the men don&rsquo;t speak English, one of them did. He didn&rsquo;t want his name used, but he said he is 28 years old, from Mexico, and has been living and working in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>illegally for the last 11 years. He&rsquo;s been at <span class="caps">IFCO </span>for only about six months and said all the men were at work Wednesday when the Guilderland plant was raided. </p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;s easy to get fake paperwork and easy to get a job. </p>
<p>Danielle Strauss asked, &#8220;Was it easy to get your job at <span class="caps">IFCO</span>?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, some places are real easy to get a job,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Danielle Strauss asked, &#8220;Do you think they knew you were illegal?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t really care, you know. I don&rsquo;t think they care.&#8221; </p>
<p>The men are now jobless and are very scared about going back home. </p>
<p>The 28-year-old said he has a much better life than he would have in Mexico, and he wants the laws to change so it&rsquo;s easier for him to become a legal citizen. </p>
<p>As far as what happens next, the men said they&rsquo;re required to appear in a Buffalo courtroom in a few weeks.</p>

<p>This problem isn&rsquo;t like muslium terrorism across the seas, the mexican invasion is personal and its happening right out side of our homes. Solving this will include personal effort from everyday americans.</p>
<p> Bush and the rest of his amigos drew plans long ago to do the wrong thing and a few little poll results aren&rsquo;t going to waver their plots. I dont care how many &#8220;arrests&#8221; are made against illegals and their employers while being televized like some puppet show. This still is our countrys&rsquo; biggest topic and will be dealt with.</p>

					<p>This is mostly for show according to what I have been reading today.  They captured them and then released them.  Very, very few are being deported back to Mexico.  This is just a show to keep the citizens quiet.  They will continue this until the elections.  After they all get elected and are snug and safe, we (the White <span class="caps">LEGAL </span>citizens) can whistle. This government is only for some of the people.

<p>RK:  I didn&rsquo;t say in my post that the country could be saved, Nate, because I firmly believe, as you do, that we are indeed past the point of no return. I was just commenting on the incident itself and to its possible repercussions.  You see, the fewer Hispanics we have here the fewer we will have to contend with when the country finally breaks into Civil War <span class="caps">II.</span></p>
<p>Another incident I closely follow, because it is directly related to the strength of our opposition, is the Black/Hispanic conflicts going on right now that give every indication of getting much, much worse.  If all out fighting breaks out between them over a long period of time, their numbers will be reduced considerably.  Also with them concentrating on each other, they&rsquo;ll give less attention to whitey which has to be good for us.  Frankly, I&rsquo;d like to see open internecine warfare between just those two groups with whites holding their score cards and betting on the outcome.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I agree with your entire post.  I think you have it right on, except maybe old Chertoff just might be serious.  I&rsquo;m being generous here.  But serious or not it won&rsquo;t change the road we&rsquo;re on.  The last sign post I saw said &#8220;Civil War II straight ahead,&#8221; and my map doesn&rsquo;t show any turnoffs.<br>

<p>Thank you Jenna for telling it like it is. All we as white people can do is circle the wagons, and not cooperate with the &#8220;multiculturalism agenda&#8221;. For example boycott anything and everything that is not a white enterprise. I admit its not an earth shattering strategy, but it will work over time.</p>

					<p>Make no mistake, Chertoff is another neo-con who will not do anything meaningful to fortify the border.  Just like his boss, Chertoff will talk macho, but do nothing.  And yes, Civil War II is coming quite quickly.  Indeed, with these massive marches by the illegals, we are slowly underway.</p>

We are fast approaching the &#8220;make or break&#8221; time for America&rsquo;s future.  Let&rsquo;s keep writing our politicians, and contributing to groups that are trying to stop this madness.

					<p>I&rsquo;m glad to know that most of you realize that this &#8220;crackdown&#8221; was just a publicity stunt.  Let me say that I, too, am optimistic that amnesty (euphemistically called the &#8220;guest worker program&#8221;) will not pass.  It <span class="caps">MAY </span>pass the Senate, but the House seems to be holding firm.  My advice is to put pressure on both the members of the House <span class="caps">AND</span> Senate, just in case.  Remind them that the same voters who put them in can just as quickly take them out.</p>

Do these things: Stop letting the banks lend them money (federally insured!); start penalizing business for hiring them; stop all of the city and state and federal governments from giving them benefits; stop teaching them Spanish in school; stop Bush and Congress from passing legislation giving amnesty; beef up the border patrol and the <span class="caps">INS </span>budgets to original levels; have Bush apologize for calling the Minutemen &#8220;vigilantes&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Do these things, then <span class="caps">MAYBE </span>we will believe that the government is serious.  Until then, we don&rsquo;t believe it.

<p>I think the significance of choosing May 1 should not go unnoted. It is the international communist &#8220;May Day&#8221;  (International Workers&rsquo; Day), although most Americans would not catch that point and it would pass them right by.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:<br>
&#8220;May Day has long been a focal point for demonstrations by various socialist, communist, and anarchist groups. In the 20th century, the holiday received the official endorsement of the Soviet Union; celebrations in communist countries during the Cold War era often consisted of large military parades and shows of common people in support of the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>In America, it was designated Loyalty Day in 2004 by Pres. Bush.<br>
The holiday was first celebrated in the 1930s as Americanization Day, and was intended to serve as a counterweight to May Day, which was celebrated as a Communist holiday.<br><br>
 Loyalty Day is celebrated with parades and ceremonies in communities across the United States, although many people in the United States remain unaware of it.&#8221;</p>

Another thing to mention &hellip; some posters have made the good point recently that a civil war is between members of the same nation.  This term, then, would not apply to invaders from without.</p>

					<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>you&rsquo;re right, ghw, that technically, Civil War II wouldn&rsquo;t be a civil war.  I just used the term so that others would know what I meant.  Maybe the term &#8220;War Against Stealth Insurgents&#8221; would be more accurate, but it doesn&rsquo;t exactly roll off the tongue.</p>
