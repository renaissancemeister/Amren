			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>icSouthLondon, April 18 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigration chiefs faced fury last night for allowing a member of a sordid Jamaican rape gang to make South London his hunting ground.</p>
<p>Sheldon Stewart, 26, was said to be part of the Buckles mob &mdash; a violent criminal outfit responsible for a spree of vile attacks in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Their hallmark is said to be a sickening initiation ceremony where new recruits are instructed to abduct and rape.</p>
<p>Yet despite being know in his homeland as a gang member, Stewart, 26, was able to move to Britain where he has:</p>
<p>* raped a schoolgirl at gunpoint </p>
<p>* held a knife to another woman&rsquo;s throat as he and a twisted accomplice tried to violate her </p>
<p>* taunted women who were prepared to stand up to him in court </p>
<p>* boasted of keeping young girls as SLAVES</p>
<p>Stewart was behind bars this week, facing a 12-year stretch for rape, attempted rape and possessing a gun.</p>
<p>But a scar-faced accomplice who took turns in raping the 15-year-old and is also a suspected Buckles member is still at large.</p>
<p>Victim support groups say the case highlights the disturbing ease in which potential sex attackers are able to slip unnoticed into the UK.</p>
<p>Their fury follows the rape and murder of schoolgirl Jeshma Raithatha by predator Viktors Dembovskis &mdash; welcomed to the UK despite a string of vile convictions in his native Latvia.</p>
<p>Immigration chiefs allowed Stewart into Britain in 2002, seemingly oblivious to the potential danger he posed.</p>
<p>This was because, like many gang members in the Caribbean, he lived under several street names making it hard for officials to keep accurate criminal records.</p>
<p>Tighter border controls were introduced in 2003, requiring Jamaican nationals to declare criminal convictions when applying to the UK, but even these are &ldquo;not an automatic barrier&rdquo; to the UK, the Home Office says.</p>
<p>Stewart first set up home in Streatham, then moved to Peak Hill, Sydenham, supposedly buying and selling cars for a living.</p>
<p>In reality he was forging links with local gangs and establishing his reputation as a man not to be crossed.</p>
<p>While his cold, dead eyes show not a flicker of emotion in the police mugshot, right, officers say he was charming and manipulative &mdash; winning over young women with his cars, designer clothes and bling.</p>
<p>Cops have probed Stewart&rsquo;s activities between April and December 2004 and believe he &ldquo;befriended&rdquo; as many as four women a week.</p>
<p>He called these women &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; &mdash; but police fear many will have have been subjected to bullying and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Inner London Crown Court heard how Stewart attacked a 15-year-old girl at gunpoint and dragged another woman into his flat in Peak Hill, Sydenham, after calling her &ldquo;a white bitch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He and the scar-faced pal threatened to &ldquo;burst&rdquo; or shoot the first victim on November 25, 2004, if she didn&rsquo;t submit to their sordid demands.</p>
<p>The girl had been lured into Stewart&rsquo;s car on the promise of cannabis and a lift. Instead, both men took turns to rape her as a gun was held to her head.</p>
<p>Stewart targeted a second victim on December 30, 2004, first trying to chat her up, then bundling her into a car on the Tulse Hill Estate.</p>
<p>He called the 25-year-old a &ldquo;white bitch&rdquo; and drove her back to the Sydenham flat, where the accomplice was again waiting to pounce.</p>
<p>Stewart held a 7in long knife to the the sob-bing woman&rsquo;s throat, but she kept calm and fooled the pair into letting her go to the toilet from where she fled.</p>
<p>The first girl, who was in social services care, was too afraid to give evidence.</p>
<p>But in an amazing show of bravery, she agreed to help nail Stewart after he phoned to taunt her over the allegations.</p>
<p>When cops from Streatham CID arrested the rapist at his girlfriend&rsquo;s home in West Norwood, he claimed the 25-year-old was a prostitute and denied having sex with the teenager.</p>
<p>But jurors found him guilty of rape, sexual assault, kidnap, two counts of false imprisonment, two counts of possessing a firearm or imitation firearm, and an additional charge of witness intimidation.</p>
<p>Passing sentence, Judge Lindsay Burn described Stewart&rsquo;s indifference towards his crimes as &ldquo;extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sentencing the killer to 11 years for the sex attacks and a further year for witness intimidation, the judge added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident to me that you thought you could behave towards women in this way and get away with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no remorse whatsoever expressed by you for what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart still refuses to name the scar-faced accomplice who police believe has now fled overseas.</p>
<p>The fugitive is also said to be an alleged member of the Buckles gang.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;wall of silence&rdquo; has protected the mob in their homeland as few law-abiding Jamaicans are prepared to give evidence against them.</p>
<p>Detective Inspector Jonathan Wilson of Streatham CID said: &ldquo;Our inquiries suggest that Stewart and his accomplice were former members of a criminal outfit called the Buckles gang who had committed similar offences in Jamaica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stewart has shown he is an extremely dangerous man who poses a real threat to young woman and girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and his accomplice behaved in a despicable manner using violence casually against victims who did not consent to his sexual advances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart&rsquo;s conviction on March 24 could not be reported until today because prosecutors were considering the possibility of further charges for witness intimidation that have subsequently been left on file.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman refused to comment on &ldquo;individual cases&rdquo;, but said: &ldquo;A criminal record is not an automatic barrier to entry to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Immigration database holds adverse information on individuals who we wish to prevent from entering the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It contains certain details of overseas criminal convictions only where this information has been made available to the Police from an individual&rsquo;s country of origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cops paid tribute yesterday to the extraordinary courage of Sheldon Stewart&rsquo;s young victims.</p>
<p>Twisted Stewart and his scar-faced accomplice threatened them with guns and knives.</p>
<p>Stewart even phoned the 15-year-old from behind bars boasting he could &ldquo;bust&rdquo; the case if she co-operated with police.</p>
<p>But far from intimidating his young victim, the chilling call inspired her to give evidence to ensure he would stay locked up.</p>
<p>Detectives have also praised the ingenuity of his second victim, 25, who managed to outwit and escape her captors despite having been punched repeatedly in the face.</p>
<p>Investigating Detective Sergeant Yasmine Watson said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t begin to imagine the fear these women must have felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many victims were too scared to give evidence following direct and implied threats from Stewart and his accomplices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both victims come from very different walks of life and both have shown unbelievable strength and determination in standing up to Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detectives pledged to continue their hunt for he scar-faced fugitive. And they warned women of all ages to avoid taking lifts with strangers.</p>
