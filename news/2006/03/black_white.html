<h1><a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/books_entertainment/reviews/La%20ShawnBarber/189829.html">Black. White.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>La Shawn Barber, Townhall.com, March 15, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To call FX&rsquo;s new reality show Black. White. shallow would be an understatement. It&rsquo;s also pointless, exceptionally trite, filled with cringe-worthy stereotypes, and teeming with double standards. </p>
<p>This overhyped show about two families trading races is standard reality TV. One of the show&rsquo;s producers is rapper Ice Cube, who also raps (sings?) the title song. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t believe the hype,&rdquo; he says. Yes, please don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The two families volunteered to live together in a house in the Los Angeles area for six weeks last summer and undergo hours-long makeup sessions to switch races. The Sparkes, a black family from Atlanta include: Brian, a 41-year-old contractor; his wife Renee, a 38-year-old office manager; and their son Nick, 17. The Marcotulli-Wurgels from California include: Carmen, a 47-year-old location scout; her shack-up boyfriend, Bruno Marcotulli, a 47-year-old teacher; and her 17-year-old daughter Rose. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The point of the show was evident. The white family, on the defensive the whole time, was supposed to experience &ldquo;racist&rdquo; America as blacks. They were obviously tense and very careful about what they said, which resulted in lines like this from Carmen: &ldquo;I love black. Visually and heart-wise, there&rsquo;s a warmth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever that means.</p>
<p>Each family was supposed to teach the other how to pass as members of the other race, but it was all one way. Bruno showed off his &ldquo;black walk,&rdquo; then Brian showed Bruno the &ldquo;black&rdquo; handshake. Cringe-worthy fare.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The double standards were evident as the black family said things that would never be tolerated from a white family. Renee implied that white women were nosy, and I waited in vain for Carmen to say something in response to the generalization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the pilot episode, we see evidence of so-called racism through Brian, who goes to a shoe store in whiteface. &ldquo;As a white guy, I&rsquo;m relaxed when I&rsquo;m shopping,&rdquo; he says. A white salesman assists him and does what salespeople do in upscale shoe stores &mdash; puts the shoes on the customer&rsquo;s feet. Brian is amazed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never happened to me black in 40 years, and the first time I go and buy shoes as a white, I have it done,&rdquo; he insists. </p>
<p>This is what passes for racism in 2006. To see if his hypothesis was true, Brian should&rsquo;ve gone back to the same store without the makeup. </p>
<p>Later, Brian in whiteface applies for and lands a job as a bartender in a mostly-white neighborhood. On his first day, he&rsquo;s mindful of how he speaks, associating proper grammar with speaking &ldquo;white.&rdquo; He asked a white patron about the neighborhood, who said it had remained mostly white, which he implied was safer. Brian was shocked.</p>
