						<p>Birth rates in the European Union are falling fast. </p>
<p>The BBC News website&rsquo;s Kathryn Westcott talks to those among a growing group who have chosen not to have children, and are fed up with the emphasis given to family life. </p>
<p>Childless or childfree? Not so long ago, all women without children were known as childless, with its implication of a state of loss. Nowadays, a growing number of women are insisting on the term childfree &mdash; with its emphasis on liberation. </p>
<p>An increasing number of women in their 30s are rejecting the job description that they believe comes with parenting &mdash; loss of freedom, reduced career prospects and financial burdens. </p>
<p>Numbers are difficult to come by, but London School of Economics sociologist Dr Catherine Hakim has carried out some extensive research in this area. </p>
<p>She has no doubt rising numbers of people are actively choosing not to have children. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In many European countries around 10% of women reach the age of 45 with no kids,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that figure, there are those who have chosen to remain childfree, those who have delayed having a child and are experiencing problems, and those who are infertile. A UN fertility study says 2-3% will fall into that category.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She believes the number without children will double in many countries to around 20% &mdash; except Germany, where the figure is already closer to 30%, partly because it is seen as having some of the most family unfriendly policies in Europe. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Taboo subject&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole idea of the childfree lifestyle is beginning to be recognised by the media,&rdquo; says Dr Hakim. &ldquo;Private feelings are being legitimised and people are beginning to feel that they are not being deviant in some way. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Very consciously people are more confident in saying they have a different lifestyle.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Despite that, in some countries where there are very strong pro-natal policies, such as France, the idea of women actively choosing not to have children is, to many, an anathema. </p>
<p>Until recently, it was extremely difficult for men and women to undergo sterilisation in France. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In France, it is difficult being a women without any children,&rdquo; says 33-year-old Alexandra, who lives in Nantes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The subject is just taboo. There is no open debate. People refuse to believe you could not want to have children &mdash; they always think it&rsquo;s because you simply haven&rsquo;t met the right person.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Alexandra, who has a long-term partner, says that up until her mid-20s, she always thought she would have children. But, after changing her mind, she says she is confident that nothing will make her change it back again. </p>
<p>Lifestyle choice </p>
<p>She says that the assumption that it is only the work-mad who shun parenthood is far from accurate. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make the choice for career reasons &mdash; it was a lifestyle choice. I only work part-time and I like to enjoy life,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p>	FERTILITY RATES In Europe 2.1 children per woman is considered to be the population replacement level. These are national averages </p>
<p>Ireland: 1.99 </p>
<p>France: 1.90 </p>
<p>Norway: 1.81 </p>
<p>Sweden 1.75 </p>
<p>UK: 1.74 </p>
<p>Netherlands: 1.73 </p>
<p>Germany: 1.37 </p>
<p>Italy: 1.33 </p>
<p>Spain: 1.32 </p>
<p>Greece: 1.29 Source: Eurostat &mdash; 2004 figures </p>
<p>Dr Hakim says that governments with &ldquo;vague pro-natal attitudes&rdquo; such as France, Sweden and Norway, claim that there is no such thing as voluntary childlessness in their countries. </p>
<p>But Mariah who lives in the city of Linkoping, Sweden, says that over the past few years, she has met more and more Swedes who are opting for a childfree lifestyle. </p>
<p>The 30-year-old says she has known that she never wanted to have children since she was a child herself. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sterilised at the age of 25. It&rsquo;s a choice I have never regretted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Once I had made the decision, I felt stronger as a woman. I have a long-term partner and he is happy with my decision.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She says that in Sweden there is a lot of pressure from family and friends to have children. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the norm and Swedes really don&rsquo;t want to stand out in a crowd. But, in the past few years, I feel there have been more and more people questioning whether or not they having children is really for them. </p>
<p>Waste </p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people simply have no maternal feelings &mdash; some are worried about how the world is going, some like to travel, some like to pursue their careers &mdash; we&rsquo;re not selfish people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfish and irresponsible,&rdquo; are words that 43-year-old Jane, who lives in London, is used to hearing. </p>
<p>In the UK, the most commonly cited statistic is that by 2010, one in four will be either childfree or childless. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I made the choice early on not to have children. I don&rsquo;t dislike them &mdash; I simply decided that I could not devote 100% of my time to someone else,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have also been called selfish but I think that people who have three children are encroaching on the planet&rsquo;s resources &mdash; I can&rsquo;t believe the amount of waste that children produce. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s population is still growing &mdash; it&rsquo;s only people in the West who are perceived to be not having enough children. People will always have children and the world will continue,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Better deal&rsquo; </p>
<p>Jane, who works in the media, says there is an increasing tension in the workplace because many employees without children feel that parents get a better deal when it comes to time off. </p>
<p>This is partly why Europe is now following the US with the establishment of active groups of the childfree, some of whom are demanding a better deal for their members. </p>
<p>Jonathan McCalmont is the founder of Kidding Aside (The British Childfree Association), which was first set up on the internet to lobby for equality for people without children. </p>
<p>He is fed up with the way the government is wooing parents with longer maternity pay, paternity leave, flexible hours and family tax breaks. He describes the latter as &ldquo;simply a middle-class tax break masquerading as social policy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He is angry at what he says is a redistribution of money from people without children to those with. </p>
<p>He contends that childfree people who have other responsibilities &mdash; such as looking after an elderly parent &mdash; should get the same benefits. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe it is up to the individual to decide what constitutes a family,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not up to the state.&rdquo;</p>
