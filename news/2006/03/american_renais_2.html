	If you haven&rsquo;t subscribed to <i>American Renaissance</i> yet, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing in the March 2006 issue: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		James Hendrickson, who lived through Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in New Orleans, describes his ordeal in &ldquo;Katrina Diary.&rdquo; Here is his description of the Superdome: 
		<blockquote>
			&ldquo;That crowd was already furious at the white man, and we felt like lit matches in a dynamite factory. Through the night, gang fights broke out around and through and over us. Whenever things got hot, we moved. To stand and fight would have been suicide. When the people next to us got too rowdy and started cursing us &ldquo;white boys,&rdquo; we packed up our hard-won cardboard mats, milk-crate chairs, military cots, and our plastic beer advertisement banner-cum-sun-shades, and moved on around the plaza to some place less racially restless. One wannabe black leader confronted our group about how the flood was all our fault. We asked why, if it was our fault, we were trapped in there too. He went off on a crazy Farrakhan-type rant, and we moved once again.&rdquo; 
		</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>American Renaissance</i> editor <a href="https://archive.jaredtaylor.org/">Jared Taylor</a> reviews <i>Science for Segregation</i>, which tells the little-known story of the resistance to the <i>Brown v. Board</i> decision. A brave crew of activists and scientists, including Carleton Putnam, Wesley Critz George, Robert Kuttner, and Ernest van den Haag, fought the ruling through their writings and the law. Their activism was surprisingly effective: a judge ruled in favor of the race realists in <i>Stell v. Savannah-Chatham Board of Education</i>, a lawsuit that challenged <i>Brown</i>. However, an appeals court overturned the <i>Stell </i>decision. 
	</li>
	<li>
		In &ldquo;The Hate Speech Double Standard,&rdquo; Stephen Webster shows that blacks view anti-white hate speech as acceptable and even amusing. Last October, Kamau Kambon, a former professor of Africana Studies at North Carolina State University, announced at a conference on race at Howard University, &ldquo;We have to exterminate whites off the face of this planet&hellip;&rdquo; Jared Taylor discussed this outrageous comment with Jimi Izrael, a black editorial assistant at the <i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i>, on the <i>Sue Wylie Program</i>, a radio talk show on WVLK in Lexington, KY. Mr. Izrael laughed out loud during the interview. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m laughing because if I had a dollar for every time I heard a black person [talking about] killing somebody white I&rsquo;d be a millionaire, like, once or twice a week.&rdquo; 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Plus news on the Cartoon Jihad, the trial of British National Party Leader Nick Griffin for incitement to racial hatred, and the deadly racial riots between blacks and Hispanics in a Los Angeles jail.
