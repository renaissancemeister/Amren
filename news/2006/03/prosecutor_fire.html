<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BUFFALO, N.Y. &mdash; A Southern Tier attorney was fired from his job as a county prosecutor Thursday over his attendance at a conference of &ldquo;white preservationists.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Michael Regan was terminated following an investigation by his boss, Allegany County District Attorney Terrence Parker, who said he had received numerous e-mails expressing concern about the assistant district attorney&rsquo;s presence at a meeting of the New Century Foundation in northern Virginia last week. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It has become clear that his recent activities will continue to significantly disrupt and impair his effectiveness as an assistant district attorney and the operations of the entire district attorney&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Parker said. </p>
<p>Regan did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment. </p>
<p>Regan was quoted in Saturday&rsquo;s Washington Post as calling participants at the conference &ldquo;white preservationists&rdquo; rather than white supremacists, and saying U.S. policies on immigration, trade and demographics have put the country on the wrong path. </p>
<p>He declined to comment in the days that followed. </p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League characterizes the New Century Foundation&rsquo;s ideology as &ldquo;intellectualized, pseudoscientific white supremacy&rdquo; and said the group promotes &ldquo;genteel&rdquo; racism. </p>
<p>The ADL&rsquo;s regional director for New York was among those who wrote to Parker, noting the article also quoted Regan as saying: &ldquo;You can see European Christian Americans are an endangered species.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Those kinds of comments are absolutely inappropriate for a public official,&rdquo; Joel Levy said. </p>
<p>A New York City lawmaker asked state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to investigate whether racism has &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; the district attorney&rsquo;s office in the rural western New York county. </p>
<p>&ldquo;An assistant district attorney within the boundaries of our state who openly ascribes to a racist ideology is a threat to every minority citizen in New York State,&rdquo; wrote Larry Seabrook, chairman of the New York City Council&rsquo;s Civil Rights Committee. </p>
<p>He asked Spitzer for an immediate investigation &ldquo;to determine if racism has contaminated the prosecutorial operations and decision-making of the office.&rdquo; </p>

						Readers might point out the double standard according to which a prosecutor of any other race would have been encouraged to attend a meeting of people like himself. The prosecutor's office no doubt claims to encourage "diversity" but apparently not of opn
