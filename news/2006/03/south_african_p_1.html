<h1><a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2006/03/26/wsaf26.xml">South African Police Accused of Ignoring Ritual Murders</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Bevan, Telegraph (London), March 26, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even in a country grown accustomed to horrific acts of violence, it is a crime that still shocks. &ldquo;Muti murder&rdquo;, in which human body parts are removed to be used in traditional &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;, is increasing in South Africa &mdash; but victims&rsquo; families complain that the police too often ignore it.</p>
<p>The murder of four-year-old Connie Ncube, whose mutilated body was discovered in a river near her home east of Pretoria by her father last month, has sparked a public outcry and demands for tougher action against the gruesome crimes.</p>
<p>Jabu Majola said: &ldquo;I was shocked to see my daughter that way. It took me 10 minutes to identify her because of the way they cut at her. I couldn&rsquo;t believe someone could do something like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Majola condemned the police for not responding to his calls for almost 12 hours after Connie disappeared. &ldquo;If they had sent police to search for my daughter when we asked them to, she would be alive today,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It was only after a report of her death appeared in a local newspaper, Mr Majola said, that the police launched a full investigation and eventually identified a suspect &mdash; a neighbour with links to traditional &ldquo;healers&rdquo; &mdash; who has not been caught.</p>
<p>According to the South African Council of Churches (SACC), there have been 49 ritual killings in one district of Limpopo province alone since the mid-1980s, including that of a seven-year-old boy, Mulweli Nemadandila, whose mutilated body was found in a stream next to his house last month. </p>
<p>Yet, from all of these, there have been only four arrests, and no convictions. The SACC is calling for the cases to be re-investigated.</p>
<p>The Rev Alunamutwe Randi-tsheni, the SACC&rsquo;s district chairman, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very worried about ritual killing at the moment, but the police seem not to be interested. People have been identified as suspects, so why are the police not arresting them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually they say these people have been eaten by a fish or crabs after drowning in the river, but what kind of a fish is it that just eats human private parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disquiet at the lack of police response has grown since it emerged that South Africa&rsquo;s occult-related crimes unit, set up in 1992 to investigate muti (Zulu for &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;) killings and Satanism, has quietly been disbanded. The unit, which once numbered 52 officers, was closed, according to a police spokesman, because &ldquo;the number of reported crimes was too low to justify its existence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But the unit&rsquo;s founder, Kobus Jonker, who has since retired, described that explanation as &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo;. </p>
<p>In 2000, he said, it had dealt with 300 cases of muti-related crimes and that number was &ldquo;definitely increasing&rdquo;. He said: &ldquo;If this unit has closed down completely, it&rsquo;s a terrible thing. It&rsquo;s not just anyone who can do this sort of investigation. You must know the culture and the superstitions of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The belief that body parts contain powerful magic which can be used to bring good luck, help a woman to get pregnant or even make a criminal invisible to the police, is widespread in Africa &mdash; and the rewards for those unscrupulous traditional healers, or sangomas, who are willing to supply them are huge. According to Mr Jonker, a human head could fetch up to Â£1,150.</p>
<p>The victim is invariably alive when the parts are taken, as it is believed that their screams make the muti even more powerful.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number of muti killings vary widely, from six a year to 100. Anthony Minnaar, a professor of criminal justice studies at the University of South Africa, said: &ldquo;Because it is often done in secret and the bodies disposed of down a mineshaft or similar, the incidence is much higher than is reported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the 800 to 900 children reported missing in South Africa every year are likely to have been murdered for muti, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Minnaar said he believed that some policemen &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want to get involved because they think they might themselves be bewitched&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Supt Attie Lamprecht, who became the head of the occult-related crimes unit in 2000, said that it had not been disbanded but had been &ldquo;absorbed&rdquo; into other units. &ldquo;The capacity is there, it does exist, but it is not a task that is full time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
