<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a black church in a black community, Helen Looby stands out as a white woman with whitish hair.</p>
<p>Long after others died or moved away, Looby remains the only white member of New Covenant Presbyterian Church in Miami &mdash; a reminder of a significant but seemingly forgotten aspect of South Florida&rsquo;s racial integration. She was there in the pews 40 years ago when New Covenant (motto: &ldquo;A church for all people&rdquo;) was formed as an interracial congregation in Allapattah, a neighborhood undergoing a white-to-black overhaul in the 1960s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel very much like I belong to that crowd,&rdquo; said Looby, a retired elementary school teacher who grew up in the Northwest section of Miami and now lives in Biscayne Park. At church recently, she said, a friend gave her a hug and said, referring to their color difference, &ldquo;We love you anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New Covenant Presbyterian Church, at 4300 NW 12th Ave., was built on that kind of racial harmony. It wasn&rsquo;t the first Miami church to desegregate &mdash; a Unitarian sect achieved that distinction in the 1940s, said University of Miami history professor Gregory Bush &mdash; but New Covenant is believed to have been the first Southern congregation in the Presbyterian Church (USA) to break racial barriers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, whereas most white churches integrated somewhat reluctantly, slowing absorbing their black neighbors, New Covenant was the first Miami church to be conceived &ldquo;with the definite purpose of integration,&rdquo; The Miami Herald wrote in 1965 in touting the church&rsquo;s launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why New Covenant is so interesting,&rdquo; said Paul George, a history professor at Miami Dade College. &ldquo;Most [white churches] sold, leased, locked their doors, held on or remained white. But for this [immediate integration] to happen, it&rsquo;s so unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The church quickly swelled, boasting some 300 worshipers at its peak, Dunn said. Over time, what began as a multicolored mix &mdash; including a few Hispanics &mdash; remained largely integrated and harmonious, despite the McDuffie race riots and continued white flight &mdash; at least until nearly all white members had died or moved away by the 1990s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fully interracial &mdash; in the choir and in the organization,&rdquo; said the Rev. Dr. Irvin Elligan, the church&rsquo;s pastor from 1970 to 1985. &ldquo;There were [white] people who were invited to black homes for dinner and vice versa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, those idyllic scenes live only in the memories of New Covenant&rsquo;s pioneers. The church has changed. It&rsquo;s nearly all black, and attendance has fallen to 50, maybe 100 on a good Sunday, making the church too small to support its own pastor.</p>
<p>Yet stalwarts like Looby, Thomas, Dunn and Powell remain and carry with them the quiet assurance of having played a part in the story of South Florida&rsquo;s racial integration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel good about it,&rdquo; Thomas said, &ldquo;and I think that over the many years, we did some really great things as a congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just like to think that we did it.&rdquo;</p>
