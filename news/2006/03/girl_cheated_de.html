<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/4712686.stm">Girl Cheated Death to Convict Killers</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eleanor Williams, BBC News, March 20, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six men have been convicted of murdering 16-year-old Mary-Ann Leneghan, who was abducted, raped and killed in Reading. </p>
<p>All six have also been convicted of the kidnap and attempted murder of her 18-year-old friend &mdash; who miraculously survived the horrific ordeal and gave evidence against the gang. </p>
<p>She endured hours of torture and rape before seeing her best friend stabbed to death by her side &mdash; and then she was told it was her turn. </p>
<p>When the gun was put to her head, she prepared to die. </p>
<p>But the bullet which was meant to kill her shattered before entering her skull. </p>
<p>She blacked out but was still alive. </p>

</table>Entering Reading Crown Court eight months later to face the accused the teenager, now aged 19, looked defiant. 
<p>The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given the choice of sitting behind a screen while giving evidence but declined. </p>
<p>Instead she turned around to stare at the six men sitting in the dock. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Blood stain&rsquo; </p>
<p>She had been sitting in the back seat of a Renault Clio outside the Wallingford Arms public house in Reading on 6 May, with her friend Mary-Ann and another girl, when the door was flung open and she was dragged out. </p>
<p>She went on to describe how they were bundled into the boot of another car and driven to a nearby guesthouse. </p>
<p>Once inside room 19 at the Abbey House Hotel, the girls&rsquo; nightmare began. </p>
<p>She was clear and coherent, but struggled to give any lengthy answers, as she described how they were kept there for three hours while members of the gang &mdash; armed with knives and guns &mdash; raped and tortured them. </p>
<p>The teenager said the floor was covered with towels to make sure their blood would not stain the carpet. </p>
<p>She went on to describe how she heard Mary-Ann being raped in the shower room. </p>
<p>The girl heard one man say from inside the bathroom: &ldquo;Stay away from the wall because her blood is going to go on it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Despite having to put up with seeing the men &mdash; now sitting surrounded by guards in the dock &mdash; sniggering and making faces, she carried on calmly describing the torture she and her friend had endured. </p>
<p>As well as being hit, punched and stabbed, the two friends were made to strip naked, had boiling water thrown over them and were made to smoke heroin and crack cocaine. </p>
<p>She remembered seeing Mary-Ann in a corner of the room being poked with a knife and stabbed in the stomach, with the men surrounding her and laughing. </p>
<p>But on the second day of giving evidence things got too much for her. </p>
<p>Describing how she was raped, Mary-Ann&rsquo;s friend broke down in tears. </p>
<p>She said at one point a gun was put in her mouth and she was told: &ldquo;This is what you&rsquo;re going to get later.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Their tormentors then decided to move on to the final steps of their plan and the girls were driven to Prospect Park. </p>
<p>They were ordered to kneel on the ground &ldquo;side-by-side&rdquo; and told to put pillow cases over their heads. </p>
<p>In graphic detail she described how Mary-Ann was stabbed all over her body by 19-year-old Michael Johnson as she lay curled up in a ball on the grass. </p>
<p>She said he flew into a rage because Mary-Ann would not sit up so that he could slit her throat. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They said something about wanting her to die slowly,&rdquo; she explained. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Ready to die?&rsquo; </p>
<p>Preparing to die, Mary-Ann&rsquo;s friend knew her last memory would be seeing her friend, who she had known for 10 years, being &ldquo;butchered&rdquo; in front of her eyes. </p>
<p>A gun was then put to her head, and she was asked &ldquo;Are you ready to die?&rdquo; before it was fired. </p>
<p>Both girls were left for dead. </p>
<p>Mary-Ann&rsquo;s friend survived and staggered out of the park to flag down a passer-by. </p>
<p>Mary-Ann&rsquo;s body was found on the morning of 7 May. She had been stabbed more than 40 times and her throat had been slit. </p>
<p>Despite the gunshot wound, her friend survived and went on to become the prosecution&rsquo;s most vital witness. </p>
<p>But she still bears the scars of the bullet that was meant to end her life. </p>
<p>Some of the fragments of shrapnel, which became lodged in her skull after it shattered, remain there today. </p>
<p>After the gang was convicted of her friend&rsquo;s murder, the Crown Prosecution Service praised her courage. </p>
<p>Reviewing lawyer Paul Harrison said: &ldquo;To relive such a traumatic ordeal while facing the perpetrators took tremendous courage. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She turned the tables in court. Suddenly the victim was strong and the attackers were vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
