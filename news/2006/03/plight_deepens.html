<p><font size="3"><p>BALTIMORE &mdash; Black men in the United States face a far more dire situation than is portrayed by common employment and education statistics, a flurry of new scholarly studies warn, and it has worsened in recent years even as an economic boom and a welfare overhaul have brought gains to black women and other groups. </p>
<p>Focusing more closely than ever on the life patterns of young black men, the new studies, by experts at Columbia, Princeton, Harvard and other institutions, show that the huge pool of poorly educated black men are becoming ever more disconnected from the mainstream society, and to a far greater degree than comparable white or Hispanic men.</p>
<p>Especially in the country&rsquo;s inner cities, the studies show, finishing high school is the exception, legal work is scarcer than ever and prison is almost routine, with incarceration rates climbing for blacks even as urban crime rates have declined. </p>
<p>Although the problems afflicting poor black men have been known for decades, the new data paint a more extensive and sobering picture of the challenges they face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something very different happening with young black men, and it&rsquo;s something we can no longer ignore,&rdquo; said Ronald B. Mincy, professor of social work at Columbia University and editor of &ldquo;Black Males Left Behind&rdquo; (Urban Institute Press, 2006).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the last two decades, the economy did great,&rdquo; Mr. Mincy said, &ldquo;and low-skilled women, helped by public policy, latched onto it. But young black men were falling farther back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The share of young black men without jobs has climbed relentlessly, with only a slight pause during the economic peak of the late 1990&rsquo;s. In 2000, 65 percent of black male high school dropouts in their 20&rsquo;s were jobless &mdash; that is, unable to find work, not seeking it or incarcerated. By 2004, the share had grown to 72 percent, compared with 34 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts. Even when high school graduates were included, half of black men in their 20&rsquo;s were jobless in 2004, up from 46 percent in 2000. </p>
<p>Incarceration rates climbed in the 1990&rsquo;s and reached historic highs in the past few years. In 1995, 16 percent of black men in their 20&rsquo;s who did not attend college were in jail or prison; by 2004, 21 percent were incarcerated. By their mid-30&rsquo;s, 6 in 10 black men who had dropped out of school had spent time in prison. </p>
<p>In the inner cities, more than half of all black men do not finish high school. </p>
<p>None of the litany of problems that young black men face was news to a group of men from the airless neighborhoods of Baltimore who recently described their experiences. </p>
<p>One of them, Curtis E. Brannon, told a story so commonplace it hardly bears notice here. He quit school in 10th grade to sell drugs, fathered four children with three mothers, and spent several stretches in jail for drug possession, parole violations and other crimes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was with the street life, but now I feel like I&rsquo;ve got to get myself together,&rdquo; Mr. Brannon said recently in the row-house flat he shares with his girlfriend and four children. &ldquo;You get tired of incarceration.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Closer studies reveal that in inner cities across the country, more than half of all black men still do not finish high school, said Gary Orfield, an education expert at Harvard and editor of &ldquo;Dropouts in America&rdquo; (Harvard Education Press, 2004). </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pumping out boys with no honest alternative,&rdquo; Mr. Orfield said in an interview, &ldquo;and of course their neighborhoods offer many other alternatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropout rates for Hispanic youths are as bad or worse but are not associated with nearly as much unemployment or crime, the data show.</p>
<p>With the shift from factory jobs, unskilled workers of all races have lost ground, but none more so than blacks. By 2004, 50 percent of black men in their 20&rsquo;s who lacked a college education were jobless, as were 72 percent of high school dropouts, according to data compiled by Bruce Western, a sociologist at Princeton and author of the forthcoming book &ldquo;Punishment and Inequality in America&rdquo; (Russell Sage Press). These are more than double the rates for white and Hispanic men.</p>

<p>Racism! What more proof do we need? Anyone recall Bill Cosby, the well-known Black TV personality? He commented on this problem placing the blame for Black failure on their unwillngness to apply themselves, to learn. That &#8216;book learning&rsquo; what acting White. We all know how his own people criticized him for airing dirty linens in public   &mdash;   or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Visit any typical public school in city with a heavy black population. Then ask the teachers to comment on the behavior of their Black students. It&rsquo;s an eye-opener.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Choice not chance determines one&rsquo;s destiny. There are dozens of studies over the decades that show that 50% of black males have an <span class="caps">I.Q </span>of 85 or lower. That&rsquo;s one helluva handicap to making logical choices, regardless of skin color. Black females have similar low <span class="caps">I.Q.&rsquo;</span>s but have better academic and employment records. So what&rsquo;s the difference? Could it be testosterone? Black males have significantly higher testosterone levels than white males. Do the testosterone drives of dominance, turf control and procreation so dominate their thoughts and actions that their is litle concern for long range planning. Who knows?</p></font><p>Posted

<p>It never stops. This reminds me of when I saw Randall Robinson ten years ago seriously claiming that the black community needed a &#8220;massive infusion of capital&#8221; to get them on the road to progress. Oh, and reparations too. <br>
A few years after that, he said he was sick of the racism here in America and that he was leaving for Africa. The liar never left, of course. Last I heard from him was back during Katrina when he was saying the blacks were eating corpses down in <span class="caps">NOLA.</span> Ha.

  <font size="3"><p>When the Article said that 50% of black men without a college education don&rsquo;t have a job it is also hard for white people to get a job without a college education. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the percentage, but I do know companies have gotten tax breaks from hiring minorities. So I don&rsquo;t understand what this author is meaning when it says &#8220;black people&#8221;, they should say many people. the reason many black males arn&rsquo;t getting hired is because many think black males without college degrees arn&rsquo;t serious they think they are nothing but thugs. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right to generalize like that, but I think it is what many employers feel. Black males should send different messages across when they wear saggy pants. pull those suckers up and then many people might have more respect for black people.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Yeah, like all these studies, they&rsquo;re a day late and a dollar short. We&rsquo;ve known this for years in the construction industry. We&rsquo;ve constantly had to readjust our standards so that we can keep the correct %&rsquo;s of minorities (blacks). Especially in respect to the educational and criminal histories of our perspective minority apprentice candidates.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not big on formal education, but many young black men don&rsquo;t know basics such as how to read a tape/rule (fractions). We shouldn&rsquo;t have to be teaching things they should have known in grade school. Anything the least bit abstract, forgettaboutit.</p>
<p>Also, this idea about black women doing better in the society is a mirage at best. If it weren&rsquo;t for all these idiotic laws requiring their presence in schools, and businesses, I assure you that within six months, the American business and academic spheres would be sans blacks.</p>
<p>As time goes by, it&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder to maintain this charade that black people are true working people. As one poster keeps saying, &#8220;worse is better.&#8221; He&rsquo;s definitely right. The time of reckoning is growing closer every day about the problem of black people in this country.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>50 percent of Black men in thier 20&rsquo;s that lack a college education are jobless. This sounds very bad but the truth is much worse. If companies were not forced to hire Blacks and the government didn&rsquo;t pick up many of the half-way educated one&rsquo;s the figures would probably be 80 percent over all unemployment. Who really wants to hire a black. Only those that are trying to appear to be racially color blind. Any job that can be filled by a black man or woman can be filled with someone of another race with less overall problems. Blacks have made themselves a liability rather than an asset. Unforturately many whites in rural areas have taken the same path with drugs and welfare. The future does not look good with a large segment of the population unemployable because of drug use, criminal tendencies and lack of skills or education.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Of course whitey will be blamed for it all. But the real problem is their willful disconnect from &#8216;mainstream society&rsquo; and not wanting to have anything to do with something &#8216;white&rsquo; (being educated, speaking well, working hard etc.)</p>

  <font size="3"><p>The Democrat Party has railroaded blacks into urban areas with the promise of everything.  This was done to create a relationship where blacks would always have to vote Democrat.  In effect, America&rsquo;s urban cities have become black reservations.  The goal of the chiefs who run these reservations is to keep the people in the reservation as voters.  The entire education system of urban America is now dedicated to failure because failure now gets funding.  In America, failure gets rewarded and accomplishment gets rejected.  Now the suburban white lands have to compete for the limited funding and they are now dedicated to failure so the white school district can compete for the funding rewards of failure.  For decades whites have been trying to warn the nation about this mistake and were ignored.  Recently a few black leaders like Bill Cosby are warning the black nation but are being shouted down.  </p>
<p>As the deterioration of the government education system continues, America will become more like Haiti or some other forth world nation.  We are already finding it difficult to compete with third world nations like India and China.  Immigration is bringing in vast numbers of people who are incapable of being assimilated into American society or who refuse assimilation. Soon America will face what the <span class="caps">USSR </span>faced, a complete collapse and fragmentation of the nation.  Russia is now a small shrinking insignificant nation of 140 million.</p>
<p>New Orleans is an example of the Black Reservation where the black voters were driven out by Katrina and will not return.  This will give whites and the small black middle class political power to make change.  America needs more Katrinas.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>From article:</p>
<p>In 2000, 65 percent of black male high school dropouts in their 20&rsquo;s were jobless &mdash; that is, unable to find work, not seeking it or incarcerated. By 2004, the share had grown to 72 percent, compared with 34 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts.</p>
<p><br>
Comment:</p>
<p>Notice how the report does not seem to mention anything about what the blacks&rsquo; <span class="caps">OWN </span>responsiblity for this situation.</p>
<p><br>
What is interesting is the Hispanic jobless rate is lower than the whites. </p>
<p>My conjecture: </p>
<p>The Hispanics&hellip;</p>
<p>1. accept their lot in life, and blame nobody</p>
<p>2. are willing  to work, <span class="caps">REALLY </span>work, not &#8220;shuffling around&#8221;</p>
<p>3. since they live close to other Hispanics, they &#8220;know&#8221; where the jobs are.</p>
<p>4. and I&rsquo;m sure their higher IQ helps.</p>
<p>As for the problems with the blacks: it&rsquo;s call one&rsquo;s action <span class="caps">BEARING FRUIT.</span> They had all these public assistance, and they wasted it. Now, their reputation has caught up with them, and much, much  less people are  &#8220;blind&#8221; to their faults, let alone even tolerate it. </p>
<p>Now they have to compete with Hispanics for the jobs. And those Hispanics are pretty hard workers! People would rather hire someone who speaks a foreign language, than them! </p></font><p>Posted

Now they want to be pimps or drug dealers. Maybe this comes from not having a father in the home to give them direction.

  <font size="3"><p>I have a question for the old-timers in this group.  (I mean those advanced in age, not those who have been posting here for a long time.)  Were blacks truly more willing to work years ago?  This seems to be a common perception and my experience with older blacks bears it out to some extent.  I also find that urban blacks are vastly lazier than those from the country, so there might be a true cultural difference there.  I have read that the &#8220;urban experience&#8221; transformed blacks for the worse, but it isn&rsquo;t easy to know when to believe anything in the <span class="caps">MSM. </span> I realize full well that blacks are genetically disposed to sloth, but there are certainly some cultural factors at play, too. <br>
If anyone knows a book that tells the truth about pre-Brown v. Board of Education black habits, please recommend it to me.  I read Nicholas Lehmann&rsquo;s The Promised Land years ago and would appreciate hearing about some similar books.<br><br>
In conclusion, I am of the opinion that blacks have truly grown lazier over the last fifty years or so.  I ask those of you who were alive to witness things to tell me if I am right.<br><br>

I&rsquo;m not that old, but I think I could sense the change. I think the problems started after the Great Society legislation, 1965.</p>
<p>Back then, the blacks I knew all had jobs. They may be lazy at it, but they went to work everyday. All their friends and relatives work, so they had better have a job too. </p>
<p>Back then, the sentiment of everybody was &#8220;I&rsquo;ll take any job to feed my family&#8221;. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s &#8220;Nah, not for me&#8221;. Whites act like that too. But it is the blacks who can least afford that attitude.</p>
<p>After the increase of welfare, the &#8220;work&#8221; then became one of trying to <span class="caps">STAY </span>on welfare to get all that &#8220;free money&#8221;.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MOST REVEALING </span>- the black family stayed together for almost all of the Jim Crow era. No Amren readers will doubt that to keep a family together,  and a black family at that, takes <span class="caps">HARD WORK. </span></p>
<p>So the dissolution of the black family (which got really bad when the welfare was really good!) and laziness went hand-in-hand.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I think society is in large part to blame.  </p>
<p>1.  In the 1960s, welfare should not have been extended to unmarried women and their illegitimate children.  Black men became unnecessary as husbands and fathers as black women relied on the state for support instead.  Wives domesticate and improve the behaviour of husbands, and fathers discipline and socialize their sons.  </p>
<p>2.  Mass immigration of Hispanics into the US probably hurts black men the most.  They used to do the jobs that Hispanics now do (e.g. janitors in <span class="caps">L.A.</span>).</p>

<p>These little boys, innocent of all this, are brought into a fractured, destroyed &#8220;family&#8221;, slum welfare funded homes, and crack desroyed &#8220;parents&#8221; all because of the white race.</p>
<p>It is the white race that has forced integration and welfare onto the black family. Back before 1965, the black man and woman<br>
and their children had a chance. They lived in all black areas where there was some social reinforcement by intelligent and educated blacks who lived amongst their own people. This, to a profound degree, ketp many in line.</p>
<p>Young black boys could see successful black men. They could see people with jobs, money and education. They had a chance.</p>
<p>Then came the white man. Oh, no. You must not live amongst your own. You  must live with us whites and not have a culture, a community and cohesiveness environment. WE will give your women food and housing. You can have white women. Ok? We do this to show we are not racist. Come, live with us. Have sex with white woman. We, the white man will take care of any little black boys  born of your soon-to-be very stupid black girls and women.</p>
<p>And so, the beauty of no responsibility, no down-side and access to white women was to much to ignore. The black man left the black areas in droves, abandoning the women of their race and lived high, pun intended.</p>
<p>And little black boys were now born in Ghettos and slums where before there were no slums, but black homes and areas.</p>
<p>You can thank the Kennedy&rsquo;s, the Humphries, the McGoverns, the Roosevelts, the Eisenhowers, etc. You can thank the Christians and their &#8220;help the poor&#8221; bancrupt &#8220;philosophy&#8221;,  and the Jews who wanted to get even, and you can thank all the do-good fools and jerks and clowns who created this mess. </p>
<p>Thank you. Because, you see, <span class="caps">NONE </span>of this could have happened without the white race making it so. The blacks could not have achieved any of this destruction without it being <span class="caps">FORCED </span>by white &#8220;dreamers&#8221;, &#8220;lovers of gods&#8221;, &#8220;equality believers&#8221;, etc. </p>

<p>As far as your question about hispanics, yes they&rsquo;re better. Especially the ones not born here. The more they&rsquo;ve been taught here, the more difficult it si to teach them. The one thing we&rsquo;ve noticed about people coming out of our educational system is this thing of self esteme. They feel so good about themselves, they reject everything that might contain cirticism. How does an instrutor teach if he can&rsquo;t criticize? I have to admit, we find some young white men in the boat as far as this goes. It&rsquo;s definitely coming from the school system.</p>
<p>As far as blacks being out on the street looking to &#8220;get paid,&#8221; I said the time of reckoning is coming. That would mean that they are going to finally be made to understand in no uncertain terms that they aren&rsquo;t going to be allowed to run around like lunatics anymore. Actually, what I have in mind is that they wouldn&rsquo;t even be in the business district. Their mere presense would be thought curious (which it actually is at this time) and attract police attention.</p>

You dont need to look for older blacks for a comparision of work ethics with current blacks. Instead simply contrast American Born Blacks with Immigrant Blacks.</p>
<p>I have an immigrant black friend, hes dumb as a post but hes not rude or mean and hes more or less willing to work. From this I draw that though blacks in general have a genetic disadvantage in the cognitive ability domain and will never rise too high, they can still work if not handicapped by their culture.</p>
<p>Comment 2) It is sad, but unavoidable, that any blacks who are willing to work (W.E.B Dubois&rsquo;s &#8220;The talented Tenth&#8221; maybe?) have their reputation sullied by the actions of their racial peers.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>To post of 10:44pm 3-20-06,<br>
The writing style of your post reminds me of my own writing style in a post I did where I talked about &#8220;materialism&#8221; being the new religion of white people (see article about museums).</p>
<p>To say that white people are responsible for the decline of some blacks in America is an interesting point of view.</p>
<p>But your race is in a worldwide decline that goes beyond a reduction in standards of living. You are losing members of your demographic because the life of materialism is encroaching into the white family value system and causing too few births per woman to maintain your population.</p>
<p>Your post reminds me of this thing that happens when you take antibiotics for an illness, but stop the treatment before all of the germs are killed.</p>
<p>The germs you failed to kill are the strongest of the germ population, with the weak selected out in a Darwinian process.</p>
<p>The &#8220;unkilled&#8221; blacks are, in an odd way, like a drug resistant infection (yes,I am willing to use that term for this post) that cannot be killed by the previous &#8220;treatment&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, in the future, Mr. 10:44pm, whites in America will be dealing with Hispanics, whites own demographic suicide, and a &#8220;hardened&#8221; remainder of the black population.</p>
<p>It is more honorable to be &#8220;destroyed&#8221; at the hands of a talented enemy, than to commit racial suicide. Thank you<br>

  <font size="3"><p>Black Nerd: &#8220;It is &ldquo;black on white&rdquo; racism in the minds of blacks that is one of the biggest reasons for my race only being &ldquo;fractionally successful&rdquo; in America. I have seen first hand, that as soon as a black person trys to study and do well in school, they are said to be &ldquo;trying to be white&rdquo;. A big fraction of blacks in America are never going to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>RK:  Well, I do have to say, guy, that I can&rsquo;t disagree with that.  Except for Jesse Petersen, I never thought I&rsquo;d hear a black person admit that.  If Rev. Petersen were as popular and listened to as Jackson and Sharpton, blacks in America would improve as a group unquestionably, and the ones who rate above the group in <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>and ability would be pulling the entire group along into an area that demanded greater respect, so long as a tight rein were placed on the lower classes who commit the most crime and violence, but there&rsquo;s about as much chance of that as having snowfall on the equater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acting white,&#8221; is something most blacks denigrate their own people with, because they can&rsquo;t compete on the white man&rsquo;s level, and they know it.   I&rsquo;m pretty sure they have tried to learn, but find it too difficult to keep up, because it is beyond their abilities.  Demeaning other blacks for trying, is their way of assuring others won&rsquo;t succeed, because they would be left behind as failures, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure would be intolerable for them because they would be viewed by everybody as not being able to cut it. Of course, it&rsquo;s racist to accuse another of &#8220;acting white,&#8221; but for them it&rsquo;s a face-saving necessity.</p>
<p>White liberal demagogues refuse to accept the truth and, instead, have pushed for every kind of program imaginable to close a gap that cannot be closed, not just with whites, but Hispanics and other races as well, and it has had devastating effects on the black community as a whole.  These people have done more to drive blacks to selling drugs, robbing banks, and criminal violence, than all the black charletans put together, although they too, as the white liberals, refuse to accept racial differences, but for different reasons:  Black inability to succeed as a group, academically, on a par with everybody else they believe reduces their stature and image by association, and they will have none of that.  They are arrogant to the core and view themselves as superior in every way.  Accepting the truth would be too humiliating for them, so they pursue their demagoguery with a vengence, exacerbating black plight rather than helping it.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem would be to face matters honestly and quit all this ridiculous pretending that everybody is the same, and peacefully divide the country up into enclaves according to race, but allow anyone to live anywhere they want with the understanding that if they cause any kind of disruption within the community such action would be cause for their ouster.  Most people would eventually settle among their own kind.  </p>
<p>The liberals love to cite evolution so much, but they refuse to believe different people were evolved through thousands of years into various family groups made to live with only one another and not placed into some mish mash of races that are drastically different and have some serious difficulties that lead to great problems.</p>
<p>A peaceful separation will never occur, but we will definitely see a separation I&rsquo;m sure of that.   And it will be anything but peaceful, so we can expect much trouble and turmoil ahead for Western Civilization. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Blacks are not our allies on immigration reform.</p>
<p><br>
Blacks seek salvation through affirmative action. The Black congegational caucus will take this new data and use to argue for more non-white immigration. They figure that the more non-whites there are, the coalition for affirmative action will be much more powerfull.</p>
<p><br>
Civil rights for blacks resulted in Whites being economically and demographically marginalized.</p>
<p>Stanely Crouch argues that fate of blacks and Whites rise and fall together. I don&rsquo;t buy this. The 1965 immigration reform act came out of the civil rights movement for blacks. The 1965 immigration refrom act has been a catastrophe for White Americans. </p>
<p>There is a direct causal line from the passage of civil rights legislation in 1965  to the commercials we see on TV today portraying asian men as intelligent and White males as morons.</p>
<p>There is a direct causal line from the passage of the 1965 civil rights act to the very real possibility of the demographic annihilation of White Americans.</p>
<p><br>
If Blacks ever find themselves enslaved by the descendants of post-1965 non-white immigrants, I will not sacrifice my sons and daughters to free them. The liberaton of blacks is bringing about  genocide for American Whites.</p>
<p>I hope the dumb blacks form a coalition with the hispanics. They probably will. If the hispanics support blacks on affirmative action, blacks will support hispanics on immigration.</p>
<p>A black and hispanic coalition will scare the  you-know-what out of Whites. This will send a strong message to Whites to completely shut down immigration completely. In other words, a strong black and hispanic racial coalition will be the single most important factor in bringing about a White nationalist political movement.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Electricity outages<br>
•Tue, 28 Feb 2006<br><br>
&ldquo;Cape Town has been reeling from regular electricity cuts over the past week. The Western Cape is reliant largely on power generated at the Koeberg nuclear power station as there is a limit to the amount of electricity that can be transmitted over the national power grid from power stations on the highveld. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br><br>
It would seem, too, that affirmative action has wrought as much damage to Eskom in stripping it of long-serving and qualified personnel as to other parastatals and government departments. Four of Koeberg&rsquo;s most experienced executives, for instance, including its power station manager, plant manager and safety director, have left to take jobs overseas&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; &ldquo;<br><br>

<p><span class="caps">PMB&rsquo;</span>s power crisis<br>
•Mon, 20 Mar 2006<br><br>
By Nalini Naidoo</p>
<p>&ldquo;City faces winter outages, warn experts</p>
<p>Pietermaritzburg is heading in the same direction as Cape Town with the possibility of ongoing power failures  &mdash;  only this time it is not Eskom to blame but the city&rsquo;s own internal system.<br>
Sources within the municipality say our system is failing because there has only been sporadic maintenance carried out for the past six to seven years and there are no qualified and experienced staff to do the work. </p>
<p>They say we have an electricity department with hardly any electricians. While planning technicians have been given jobs, not a single electrician has been employed in the last seven years. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Sources have described the city&rsquo;s electricity department as a sinking ship. Last year there was a major trip and power went off in three quarters of the city. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br><br>
They allege that the sinking ship is captainless as the process manager or head, Simphiwe Mchunu, has been away for extended periods on stress leave. His last lengthy absence was from December to mid-February&hellip;&hellip;.<br><br>
So what&rsquo;s going wrong? <br><br>
It seems that the power coming in from Eskom is being fed into a system of aging sub-stations that have not been maintained. In addition the city is growing at an alarming rate, yet the municipality is not putting in enough sub-stations to keep up with the growth, nor are plans being prepared by the forward planning department for new sub-stations. The experts believe that if councillors investigate they will find that the forward planning department has no funds. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p> But only sporadic maintenance has been carried out in the past seven to eight years. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
However, the biggest problem, say sources, is that the city has an electricity department that is functioning without electricians&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; </p>
<p>They say Mchunu  &mdash;  a technician with a B. Tech. degree  &mdash;  does not have the range of skills required to run an electricity department. His absence on stress leave is taken as an indication that he is not coping. <br>
The situation is not being helped by the fact that all the new staff being employed are technicians rather than electricians. The department previously had a system of apprentices moving up the ranks, but no electrician has been employed in the past seven years.

  <font size="3"><p>It is not &#8220;black culture&#8221; that keeps blacks from working - it&rsquo;s the welfare culture. The Hispanics who are coming here illegally would be more than happy to take cash-aid welfare if they could, but they can&rsquo;t (they still get all sorts of other gov&rsquo;t benefits, though, and their presence increases the number of Americans who need such programs*.)</p>
<p>Take away the welfare and able-bodied people will work.</p>
<p>Getting the Congressional Black Caucus on our side in this matter would be a coup. They have every reason to oppose illegal immigration, and they have 40 voting members in the House.</p>
<p><br>
* See the <span class="caps">USA</span> Today article that shows enrollment in government welfare programs increased 17% over the last 5 years, while &#8220;only&#8221; rose 5%.<br><br>

<p>Well George, I will agree that blacks overall are not smart enough as indicated above,if you will agree that the 7204VXR is an overpriced piece of junk even with about twice the back-plane bandwidth of the 7204 router it replaced (1 gigabit compared to 600 mb).<br>

<p>Considering what constitutes most of the current crop of black men nowdays,  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s an appropriate statment.</p>
<p>The article says, &#8220;Focusing more closely than ever on the life patterns of young black men.. &#8220;Incarceration rates climbed in the 1990&rsquo;s and reached historic highs in the past few years. In 1995, 16 percent of black men in their 20&rsquo;s who did not attend college were in jail or prison; by 2004, 21 perent were incarcerated. By their mid-30&rsquo;s, 6 in 10 black men who had dropped out of school had spent time in prision. In the inner cities, more than half of all black men do not finish high school&#8221;</p>

<p>My question is, if this were true, why didn&rsquo;t it happen to whites and asians?  Why didn&rsquo;t they drop out of the workforce?  Where are all the white street gangs and drug dealers hanging out at the corner?  Where are all the whites and asians filling up the jails?</p>
<p>The real story is that, with the Civil Rights movement, and affirmative action, blacks no longer felt they should, or were compelled to, imitate white family structures.  They looked upon that way of life with contempt, and went back to their instinctive, traditional african family structure.  Same results here as there.</p></font><p>Posted

At one time, I actually thought you might have been someone on the Amren editorial staff and I was surprised that you have also had some moderation of your post in the past. I read your &#8220;10:44&#8221; post several times and was shocked by the many &#8220;nails&#8221; you hit right on the head about some of the damage smart blacks do when they leave black communities to live in nicer areas. If my people can&rsquo;t live next to a &#8220;black nerd&#8221;, then they will never see that there is a better way.</p>
<p>We disagree on the point of blacks being &#8220;invited&#8221; to live with whites and enjoy white women, but on the &#8220;racial battlefield&#8221; it is our job (you and I) to disagree in some areas.</p>

<p>What is the welfare culture? The most extensive welfare states in the world are in Scandinavia, and so are the highest employment rates: the four Scandinavian countries, plus Switzerland, comprise the five countries with the highest employment rates in the world. Yes, here are societies where there is no need to work, where taxes are higher than anywhere else, and yet the percentage of people who do work is higher than in low-tax countries like the UK and <span class="caps">USA.</span></p>
<p>However, Third World immigrants have shockingly low levels of participation in the labour force, together with extremely high levels of violent crime. This is especially true of those from sub-Saharan Africa, such as Somalis. How can this be blamed on the welfare state, when it&rsquo;s only some ethnic groups that refuse to work, and commit so many violent crimes?</p></font><p>Posted

<p>The National Geographic Magazine ran a &#8220;feel good&#8221; edition attempting to show the &#8220;progress&#8221; made in Africa by the various black nations   &mdash;   possibly written by some Jared Diamond guy who carefully <span class="caps">AVOIDED </span>mention of the real problems.

  <font size="3"><p>Wait till the No Child Left Behind Act is fully in force in several years.  No one will be able to graduate high school without proficiency in English and math. (You will have to be able to reason, deduce fact from data and read more than a cartoon). Except for a small minority that the Ivy League type schools grab anyway, there will be fewer African Americans in high schools and college enrollments will plummet.  Black college graduates will be even fewer, including from the easy to enter &#8220;black&#8221; colleges where most blacks hope to go because those schools are so easy.</p>
<p>America had best prepare for a new &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement once it dawns on black leaders and their liberal allies that the &#8220;right&#8221; to high school education has vanished for African Americans due to the federal law changes, <span class="caps">NCLB </span>in 2001, supported by both parties.  That law will not &#8220;raise&#8221; achievement, it will weed out the non-learners that haven&rsquo;t already been dumped by the current easy to graduate high schools.  So the already large numbers of uneducated, unruly masses of young AA will further increase. <br>

<p>Black Nerd,</p>
<p>Good posts as usual. What is interesting is that the young &#8220;whites&#8221; who have grown up as minorities (like yours truly).  As well as the other young whites who have the self hating white mans oppressive boot on their heads are all going to be very hardened as well.  In fact, Hitlers biggest complaint about whites is that they were not ethnocentric enough.  Well lookout.  For the record, I do not believe the Latin Population explosion will do anything but take back Atzlan (numerically they can do that right now  &mdash;  -but numbers are not everything).  I see this country splitting up long   &mdash;  long before whites become a minority.  I don&rsquo;t see the current situation going another 10 years.  </p>
<p>The big challenge will be for interracial folks/families and for decent Blacks like yourself. They wil have problems.  Well maybe not a talented black man like yourself (unless you have a white wife). Can you imagine being the white female in a newly liberated black area?  You can kiss her goodbye!  When I was back in Detroit last time (I grew up there).  Every black women I talked with   &mdash;  pretty much stated that they are ready to start to shooting black men.  They were angry and disgusted with black men for many reasons beyond &#8220;dating out&#8221;.  They definately don&rsquo;t want white women around.  I would be willing to bet black women would go for a seperation <span class="caps">ASAP. </span> Forget the Klan   &mdash;    &mdash;  if you are a black man   &mdash;  -worry about   Black Women!!  <br>

<p>&#8220;Could it be aggression? Black females are not usually dangerous to be around. Not so black males. Sort of makes it harder in the ole job market.&#8221;</p>
<p>You got a lot to learn. I hope you don&rsquo;t learn it the hard way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one example for you: Chicago; young white college student sitting on a bus with a knife in his duffle bag. He probably thought he might need it in some of the bad neghborhoods he had to go through to get to school. A young black women spots the knife and without warning stabs him to death with it. That&rsquo;s just one of many examples I could list to disprove your statement. Live and learn. Or not.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>It&rsquo;s amazing that this article is of such an interest to so many people.  Everyone wants to comment on an article that confirms their fears, wants, regrets, prejudices.  But if this were an article showing black people in a positive light would you care to comment?  Of course not!  You want to hear about the bad things.  You want to hear about the worse people and come up with the most prejudice and racist solutions to the problems.  I do not believe anyone who has commented on the plight of the black male is qualified to do so.  Likewise, black men have a right to comment on the plight of the white man.  The poster that earlier talked about self responsibility is correct but it goes beyond just owning up to your own actions and taking the consequences, it leaks into not doing, saying, and thinking things that hinder someone else.  To say that you should ignore what other people say or that what they say have no value to your own life is a lie.  Everyone at some point or another have been influenced by what someone else has said or done to them.  Because of this, it is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to help anyone in need regardless of race or sex.  Sitting at your computer at home looking for articles that agree with your racist points of view don&rsquo;t help you disposition or our society.  Wake up gentlemen and come to 2006!  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;Black American males are the most successful people in the history of Mankind. Most have children by several women, often white, and don&rsquo;t pay a penny to support them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Godzilla pimp, let&rsquo;s examine this statement logically.  There are approximately 40 million blacks in America, that makes 20 million black  males, if we eliminate say 10% of those too young to conceive children or impotent, that leaves 18 million black males.  If &#8220;most&#8221; of those black males; let&rsquo;s say 10 million, had &#8220;children by several women&#8221;, as you assert, and if we define the term several as between three and infinity (we&rsquo;ll settle on a low number, say four) that would make 40 million black kids fathered by just 10 million black males.  Now assume for a second that not one of the other 8 million black males  had ever had children.  the population breakdown would be as follows:</p>
<p>Black Females: 20 million<br>
Randy Black males 10 million<br><br>
Children of randy black males 40 million<br><br>
Black males impotent or too young to procreate 2 million<br><br>
Black males without kids 8 million.</p>
<p>This would lead to a total of 80 million blacks in today&rsquo;s America not the 40 million we now have which renders your statement silly, reactionary, and just plain dumb.</p>
<p>In addition a quick search will tell you that when the civil war broke out, blacks comprised about 12% of the US population.  That figure has risen today: to a whopping  13%.  So much for your theory of most black males and their multiple children.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please do not be afraid to ask.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>To the writer of the message on &#8216;12:59 AM on March 23&rsquo;:</p>
<p>Many of us would be very interested in news about groups such as Africans succeeding, or African countries succeeding. For one thing, if Africa succeeds, there will be no reason for so many Africans to break our laws to enter Europe. At the same time, it will mean all those immigrants who are already here are not a write off, as the evidence suggests the majority of them are, but instead can be educated to become productive contributors to society.</p>
<p>When I have looked for information to refute the hypothesis that the problems of the unsuccessful ethnic minorities are largely explained by biology, I have found a lot of attempts to explain their failure by pointing to &#8216;European racism&rsquo; (even in societies without any significant number of Europeans!), but virtually nothing to suggest these groups are successful anywhere in the world. Conversely, immigrants who come from successful races tend to be successful too, even if they aren&rsquo;t the same race as the native population.</p>
<p>I agree it is the duty of those who are more able to help those who are less able, especially within a society, and also amongst societies, but this must be done with the clear understanding that those who are more able are helping because they wish to lessen the suffering of the less able, and not because they are responsible for it. It must also be understood that such help will never solve problems rooted in biology. If either of these is misunderstood, the result will only be increased hatred of the successful groups by the unsuccessful ones.</p>
<p>Although we should help poor countries, there is no obligation to allow our lands and cultures to be overrun by immigrants from these countries, who cannot or will not appreciate our culture, and will only recreate enclaves of their own backward societies within ours, leading to ethnic conflict, violoent crime and other social problems. We should not allow any more of them in, and those who are already here should be encouraged to go home, since they clearly do not fit into our social models, and most of them probably never will.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p> Dear 12:59 AM on March 23-Sitting at home looking at the world through rose-colored glasses isn&rsquo;t very productive either, especially when our culture and civilization is crumbling around us, It reminds of someone on the Titantic who sits on the deck imagining that everything is going to turn out swell! It is even worse to get involved in facilitating the decline by supporting left-wing charities and programs based upon the radical egalitarianism of the Left. Hand-wringing liberals who constantly make excuses for minority nonachievement  bring on more nonachievement by tacitly excusing it, casting minorities spuriously into the role of &#8220;victims&#8221;. A little less minority self-esteem, and more assumption of responsibility might make a difference, but responsibility is a concept foreign to liberals.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Replying to belle kerve at 12:59 PM on March 24:</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8220;I agree it is the duty of those who are more able to help those who are less able, especially within a society, and also amongst societies&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The simple answer is, because we can. Within a society, everyone goes through stages where they are more or less able to contribute to support themselves and others. Supporting the young in education, for example, allows them to return more to society when they start working. The old have already contributed, and may no longer be able to, so it is comforting to all who are contributing to know that they will not have to fear poverty when they are old. They will then be more willing to take risks with new ideas and businesses when they can, and will be less tempted to cheat, etc.</p>
<p>There is also very strong evidence that a welfare state, producing more equal distribution of wealth within a society, leads to a more stable society, with less crime and division, and higher overall prosperity. However, this does not work for some groups (eg Third World immigrants), who abuse the system if they are allowed to.</p>
<p>A utilitarian argument can also be made, in that the poor/unemployed who receive subsidies from the state receive greater utility from those subsidies than is lost by those who pay for them. The same people typically give and receive at different times too, so it is not just an endless transfer from one group to another (except for transfers to some immigrant groups), which can be divisive.</p>
<p>Finally, a welfare state is the best way to allow everyone in society to make the best use of their potential. There will of course be differences in outcome, stemming from differences in ability, et al, but if everyone can live comfortably by doing what they&rsquo;re able to, these differences will not lead to social unrest. (Again, the system does not appear to work with Third World immigrants.)</p>
<p>Transfers from one society to another are not as important, but the utilitarian argument still applies: a small sacrifice in contriuting to charities in rich countries can do a great deal of good in poor countries. I&rsquo;d also say that it is an intrinsically good thing to alleviate the suffering of others, if it can be done without introducing suffering elsewhere.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Dear Student-There is no duty for those who can to give to those in need-read the old fable of the &#8220;Little Red Hen&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t facilitate co-dependency. Most charities and charitable foundations nowadays have been co-opted and taken over by leftists, so supporting most charities today means supporting and facilitating the agenda of the Left. The agenda of the Left, in turn, is what is penalizing initiative, coarsening our culture, &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; our children and destroying our moral and ethical standards-in other words, it is the problem we should seek to eradicate, not nurture and fertilize with money. So choose the charities you support very carefully-the only sound a liberal truly fears is the sound of a closing purse! </p></font><p>Posted
