						<p>Europe&rsquo;s botched civilization, perverted by socialism and lost faith, seems to have lost the will, the passion to sustain itself. If it continues to practice today&rsquo;s multiculturalist leftism, Europe&rsquo;s demographic doom will be sealed. Some harbingers:</p>
<ul>
<p><li>In Brussels, Belgium, the most popular </font><a href="http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lawcontent&amp;task=view&amp;id=12921&amp;Itemid=47"><font size="3">name</font></a><font size="3"> for baby boys is now Mohammad. Sustaining the population of a nation requires that on average each couple gives birth to 2.1 children. The average European couple now has fewer than 1.4 babies, compared to 3.6 babies born to the average Muslim immigrant couple in Europe. Across Western Europe </font><font size="3">16 to 20 percent of babies</font><font size="3"> are being born into Muslim families. </li></p>
<p><li>In France at least 12 percent of the population is already Muslim, the fruits mostly of immigrants from former French colonies in North Africa. If present birth trends continue, by 2030 a quarter of France&rsquo;s people will be Muslim, more than enough to determine who controls the national parliament and executive. As this columnist recently noted, the nuclear-armed French military is already </font><font size="3">15 percent Muslim</font><font size="3">. Adjacent Switzerland is now 20 percent Muslim. </li></p>
<p><li>The German newspaper Deutsche Welle days ago </font><a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1934571,00.html"><font size="3">reported</font></a><font size="3"> that Germany&rsquo;s birth rate in 2005 fell to a level lower than at the end of World War II, to a &#147;historic low,&#148; more than fifty percent lower than those of France and Great Britain. But at a </font><font size="3">meeting</font><font size="3"> this week in Berlin that brought together the interior ministers of six European nations, Germany&rsquo;s leftwing Social Democrats continued to oppose the application of any test or standard that would restrict who could migrate into Germany.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>The burgeoning Muslim population within Europe is not evenly spread. It is largely concentrated in and around big cities, whose local politicians feel its pressure acutely and often bend to that pressure. In the Netherlands the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam </font><a href="http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lawcontent&amp;task=view&amp;id=12921&amp;Itemid=47"><font size="3">nearly</font></a><font size="3"> have Muslim majorities now.</p>
<p>These Islamic enclaves are already taking on the character of conquered provinces that no longer belong to the European countries around them. As FrontPage Magazine recently </font><font size="3">quoted</font><font size="3"> from the new book While Europe Slept by liberal American expatriate Bruce Bawer:</p>
<em><p>In France, a public official met with an imam at the edge of Roubaix&rsquo;s Muslim district out of respect for his declaration of the neighborhood as Islamic territory to which she had no right of access. In Britain, imams have pressed the government to officially designate certain areas of Bradford as being under Muslim, not British, law. In Denmark, Muslim leaders have sought the same kind of control over parts of Copenhagen. And in Belgium, Muslims living in the Brussels neighborhood of Sint-Jans-Molenbeek already view it not as part of Belgium but as an area under Islamic jurisdiction in which Belgians are not welcome.</em><i> </p>
</i>
<p>Europe has several potential choices in the face of a flood of immigrants and families within its borders who refuse to assimilate European values of mutual toleration and liberal social policies. </p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s cultural polarization vis-&agrave;-vis its Muslim underclass is being exacerbated by socialist policies that are producing stagnant economies and high unemployment. These fruits of Euro-socialism have also created a political tinderbox of Muslim frustration and, as we saw in recent days of protests in Paris, an angry refusal by many traditional Europeans to reform or relinquish their welfare state and job security benefits. This climate discourages investors and pits new and traditional Europeans against one another.</p>
<p>If Europe continues as it is now, the rising Muslim tide will, one at a time, transform the members of the European Union into Islamic Republics under Islamic <i>Shari&rsquo;a</i> law as Muslims become the majority population. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another method used to transfer wealth from Europeans to Eurabian Muslims is theft. Some radical Mullahs have told their European congregations that Islamic <i>Shari&rsquo;a</i> law justifies shoplifting and other forms of </font><font size="3">stealing</font><font size="3"> from European merchants and companies as a way to make non-Muslims pay the discriminatory jizya tax that is extracted from non-Muslim citizens in Muslim countries.</p>
<p>And in Europe&rsquo;s growing Islamic neighborhoods, where police are often afraid to go, European law is being supplanted by <i>Shari&rsquo;a</i>. European women venturing into or near such enclaves have been assaulted and, in some cases, raped by gangs of macho Islamic males for violating Muslim dress codes and failing to exhibit the subservient status some Islamic subcultures require of females. </p>
<p>Forty percent of Muslims living in Great Britain want Islamic <i>Shari&rsquo;a</i> law introduced into parts of that country, according to a </font><a href="/news/main-jhtml_jsessionid_SMMW4PZNND4QVQFIQMFCFF4AVCBQYIV0_xml_/news/2006/02/19/nsharia19.xml"><font size="3">poll</font></a><font size="3"> reported last month by the London Sunday Telegraph.</p>
