					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Clennell, Sydney Morning Herald, March 24, 2006</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every New South Wales public school will have to appoint a teacher to be an anti-racism officer to &ldquo;teach tolerance within normal school lessons&rdquo;, the Premier, Morris Iemma, will announce today.</p>
<p>But the Teachers Federation yesterday criticised Mr Iemma, saying the idea was not new.</p>
<p>The Department of Education&rsquo;s website shows anti-racism contact officers were supposed to have been in NSW schools since at least 2003. The idea was first announced in Parliament by the Coalition government in 1993.</p>
<p>Mr Iemma&rsquo;s office said last night that the program had not been implemented properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up until now it has not been as specific as every single school will have one,&rdquo; said Mr Iemma&rsquo;s spokesman, Ben Wilson.</p>
<p>A speech Mr Iemma will deliver today says: &ldquo;Some years ago we began the process of ensuring that our students had access to dedicated staff members trained to respond to issues of racism. It is true we&rsquo;ve not been as successful as we should have been in ensuring these resources are available in all our schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Teachers Federation president, Maree O&rsquo;Halloran, said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s quite a strong anti-racism policy already in the department. It may well be right that it wasn&rsquo;t fully implemented [having the officers in every single school] but the anti-racism policy is not new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Iemma said all of the 2240 public schools in NSW would have a designated staff member trained to handle racism issues, with the teacher to be nominated by the principal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schools will for the first time include anti-racism strategies in their three-year school plans and will detail their effectiveness in the annual school reports,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In the past month Mr Iemma has announced a taser gun trial for the riot squad, a water cannon for the same squad and an increase in police and riot squad numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respect for teachers as authority figures is fundamental in our schools,&rdquo; Mr Iemma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to send a clear message that there is no place for racial intolerance in our classrooms and playground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will mean that any student anywhere in the state, can have someone to turn to if they feel victimised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a speech Mr Iemma is set to deliver announcing the plan today, he says society is undermined every time people swore at a teacher, dropped litter on the ground, failed to vote, evaded taxes or &ldquo;every time we ignore an old lady left standing on a crowded bus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Iemma said he was concerned about people who developed &ldquo;disdain and disrespect for authority from an early age&rdquo;. He mentioned riots at Redfern, Macquarie Fields, Dubbo and Cronulla and added: &ldquo;In light of those trends, we make no apologies for building new jails, passing tougher laws, hiring 750 new police and, yes, acquiring a water cannon for the worst disturbances&rdquo;.</p>
