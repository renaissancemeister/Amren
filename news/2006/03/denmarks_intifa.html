<div align="left"><i>Paul Belien, American Conservative, March 13, 2006</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Denmark is one of Europe&rsquo;s smallest countries; it has only 5.5 million inhabitants. Until the beginning of this year it was known mainly for dairy products, butter cookies, Legos, and Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s fairy tales. However, conservative Europeans had been watching Denmark for some time. Since Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen&rsquo;s center-right coalition came to power in 2001, Copenhagen has introduced the most sensible immigration policies in Europe. </p>
<p>Today, Denmark is at the center of a controversy over 12 drawings, the infamous Danish cartoons. Syria and Iran have virtually declared war on Denmark, Danish consulates and embassies have been attacked in the Middle East and Africa, and Islamic countries are officially boycotting Danish products. </p>
<p>Those who believe that the whole issue has to do with 12 cartoons are naïve. Denmark is being punished for its alleged Islamophobia. Its crime is not the publication of 12 drawings in Jyllands-Posten, a paper in the rural province of Jutland. Its crime is the staunch refusal of the Danish Vikings to allow Muslim immigrants to impose their laws upon their host country. </p>
<p>In 2001, the various parties of the center-right and so-called &ldquo;far Right&rdquo; won the Danish elections. As a consequence, Rasmussen&rsquo;s free-market Liberals formed a coalition with the Conservatives. The new government did not have the majority in the Folketing, the Danish Parliament, but it received the support of the Dansk Folkeparti, the populist, anti-immigration Danish People&rsquo;s Party led by the housewife-turned-politician Pia Kjaersgaard. </p>
<p>In return for Kjaersgaard&rsquo;s support, but also because the two coalition parties believed it was necessary, the government introduced drastic measures to curb the influx of low-skilled immigrants from Third World countries. &ldquo;There is no danger that Denmark will become a multicultural society, because this is not our goal,&rdquo; Rasmussen said before the elections. </p>
<p>The new government introduced legislation that made it harder for immigrants to enter Denmark and to acquire Danish nationality. Copenhagen began to repatriate illegal immigrants and encouraged rejected asylum seekers to leave. It implemented stricter rules to determine who should receive residence permits. It slashed social benefit payments to newcomers, allowing them only a box of bare necessities. </p>
<p>As a result, the number of asylum seekers in Denmark dropped from 12,100 in 2000 to 3,222 in 2004. The number of people recognized as refugees decreased from 5,159 in 2000 to 1,607 in 2004. Residence permits for family reunification dropped from 10,021 in 2000 to 4,791 in 2003. The number of people acquiring Danish nationality fell from 18,811 in 2000 to 6,583 in 2003, with Asians down from 7,844 to 1,436 and Africans from 2,371 to 312. People who wanted to become Danes had to pass a language, culture, and history test. </p>
<p>After the February 2005 elections, which the Labour opposition lost, Rasmussen formed his second Liberal-Conservative minority government. Again he could count on the support of Kjaersgaard&rsquo;s Dansk Folkeparti. &ldquo;Our immigration policies are widely supported by the people,&rdquo; Rasmussen said. </p>
<p>The government announced that in 2006 it would curb the flow of immigrants from Third World countries even further. According to Claus Hjort Frederiksen, the minister for employment, immigrants from countries such as Somalia, Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon constitute an untenable burden on Danish welfare. &ldquo;We are simply forced to adopt a new policy on immigration. The calculations of the welfare committee are terrifying and show how unsuccessful the integration of immigrants has been up to now,&rdquo; he said. Frederiksen announced that from this year on immigrants will only be allowed into Denmark if they have a job waiting for them. A government committee calculated that if immigration from Third World countries were blocked completely, 75 percent of the cuts needed to sustain the very generous Danish welfare system in the coming decades would not be necessary. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite threats and international pressure, Rasmussen refused to give in to demands that he apologize for cartoons published in a privately owned newspaper, but he misjudged his enemies by underestimating the extent of their deceit. The imams continued repeating their lies and called for an international boycott of Denmark. By the end of January, Muslims were up in arms throughout the Islamic world. Danish products were boycotted, flags were burned, embassies and consulates were ransacked and destroyed. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Where Denmark is concerned, however, the lying imams seem to have shot themselves in the foot. There is a general call to expel Abu Laban and the other imams, as well as all immigrants who do not accept the values of Danish society. The affair has conveyed the message that a multicultural society cannot work because the intolerant culture will impose its will on the tolerant one. &ldquo;I believe it has become obvious that the imams are not the people we should be listening to if we want integration in Denmark to work,&rdquo; said Integration Minister Hvilshøj. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The events in Denmark have been closely monitored in the rest of Europe, and will probably strengthen the electoral appeal of immigration-reform parties, who have been observing Danish policies for a couple of years now. In France and Germany, leading right-wing politicians and advocates of law and order, such as Nicolas Sarkozy, the French interior minister, and Wolfgang Schäuble, his German colleague, spoke out in support of the Danish government. </p>
<p>The cartoon affair comes as the second clash in barely three months between the traditional territorial nation-states of Europe and the forces of Eurabia. The first clash was November&rsquo;s French intifadah when Sarkozy opposed gangs of Muslim thugs who wanted to assert power over parts of French territory. In Denmark, radical imams tried to assert power over the media. In both cases, Europe fought back, albeit hesitantly. The Danish resistance even compelled the generals of Eurabia to enlist the help of the entire Muslim world to intimidate one of Europe&rsquo;s smallest countries. And still the Vikings held their ground. Perhaps all is not yet lost.</p></font>

  <font size="3"><p>An interesting human trait is what happens when somebody is offended. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Kind and passive people, when offended, many times get <span class="caps">MORE </span>angry and more violent than people who start off &#8220;mean&#8221;. I have seen that once a &#8220;liberal&#8221; is crossed or changes their stand, they really go at it. Like a reformed smoker.</p>
<p>People like reformed smokers, AA reformed drinkers are some of the most militant people. &#8220;Liberal&#8221; anti-gun &#8220;NOW&#8221; women, who get raped, become some of the strongest advocates for hand-gun ownership for women. It is an interesting paradox.</p>
<p>Denmark, being the most liberal and &#8220;open&#8221; of the European nations seems to be doing this. They tolerate, but when the are insulted, <span class="caps">WOW </span>do they get really &#8220;closed&#8221; minded. This is good.</p>
<p>We need the white back-lash and the nastier and more vicious it is the better. I am hoping all the &#8220;do good&#8221; liberal PC fools in this nation get really nasty when we get the arab nuke blast in this country.</p>
<p>When the arab sleeper soldiers begin their suicide attacks right here in the <span class="caps">US, </span>then I think the nation may get a back-bone and be wiling to really take the <span class="caps">WAR </span>to the muslims.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Very interesting, last night I posted these comments to the article, Local Elections &mdash; National Consequences, linked below:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2006/03/local_elections.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2006/03/local_elections.php</a></p>
<p>In it, it is noted that nonwhite &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; voters, threw recent local elections in Holland to the left wing bleeding-hearts there, with myself observing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is what I will never understand, it is in the best interests of any &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; party in any white country to keep the electorate (and population) as white as possible. This would be particularly true, if they are swept into power on promises of doing &ldquo;something&rdquo; along these lines. If this means ending all immigration, then do it; if it means enacting laws that hamper &lsquo;Dutch people with a foreign background&rsquo; from voting, then do it; if it means expelling as many &lsquo;Dutch people with a foreign background&rsquo; as possible and on every conceivable pretext, then do it.</p>
<p>Do it without hesitation or regret, since those that are gone or cannot vote by the next election will be of no concern in that election! This comes with the knowledge that the other side, is doing the same in a different direction:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Left is perceived to be the welfare state&rsquo;s Santa Claus. Most of the immigrants who came to Europe during the past decades were attracted by the generous welfare benefits which Western Europe lavishly bestows on the &lsquo;underprivileged.&rsquo; Today, owing to their demographic growth, the immigrant vote is increasing as more and more young immigrants reach voting age. In many countries the Left has begun to cater for the immigrants, aware that the immigrants guarantee their power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Do not worry about the sanctimony of the other side regarding the &lsquo;underprivileged&rsquo; and all that, it is answered quite easily!</p>
<p>To The Victors Go The Spoils, We Are A Dutch Government That Is: By The Dutch, For The Dutch, And Will Only Serve The Interests Of The Dutch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite refreshing to see that my speculations of only a night ago, have a real life example of my suggestions being put into practice in Denmark! And while it feels good to be vindicated on this smaller point of mine, it feels even better to see that my greatest concern in disproving the Marxist myth that the West can only &ldquo;survive&rdquo; with the &ldquo;strengths of diversity.&rdquo; Here too the Danes are making mincemeat of this sanctimoniously idiotic theory, through practicing its noble antithesis with brave resolve!</p>
<p>Denmark appears to be the mouse that is roaring commonsense and sanity, to the rest of the West and we should all take notice. In particular, the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; parties in these nations who fret that the &ldquo;new bloods&rdquo; won&rsquo;t vote for them, if they are not wooed with pandering and groveling. As I noted above in last night&rsquo;s post, if you get rid of the &ldquo;new bloods&rdquo; and protect your traditional white power base from being marginalized, nature and votes will take their respective courses one hopes?</p>
<p>Another point that I found to be very interesting above was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A government committee calculated that if immigration from Third World countries were blocked completely, 75 percent of the cuts needed to sustain the very generous Danish welfare system in the coming decades would not be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, we see that the reality of safeguarding ones society from the &ldquo;enrichment&rdquo; of parasites, will have a healthy and positive effect on ones society. Go figure?</p>
<p>In the end, I remain hopeful that if the Utopian States of Amerexico, can observer a Eurabia returning back to a secure whites only Europe and prospering, then perhaps we will come back to our senses and work our way back to being the United States of America, with a secure and prospering white majority that increases its percentage of the population every decade, instead of shrinking?</p>
<p>Hey, God let it be so! </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The Vikings held their ground.</p>
<p>The Vikings were once the terror of the Western World.  Old records found in Iceland tell of a Viking circumnavigation of Greenland.  They just wanted to see if there was anyone there, so they could kill them and take their stuff, or at least trade with the locals if they were too strong for the first approach to work.  Sicily was once a Viking kingdom.  Vikings took over Russia at one point, a group called the &#8220;Russ&#8221;, for which the country is still named.  They used to sail down the Don to the big bend, and then cross to the Volga.  Of course they didn&rsquo;t portage their 100-foot boats; they built new ones, and were once the terror of the Caspian.  They were a serious menace on the north shore of Persia (Iran.)</p>
<p>Good for Danemark (it&rsquo;s real name!)</p>
<p>Danemark was the first Western nation to outlaw the death penalty, and (I think) the first to outlaw slavery, even for criminals.  Old Norse law also gave us the right to trial by jury.</p>
<p>Danes are stubborn.  When the Nazis wanted the Jews removed, the Danes smuggled them to Sweden.  The German administrator cooperated with the Danes on that issue, and told Heinrich Himmler &#8220;You wanted them removed from Denmark.  They&rsquo;re gone.&#8221;  Himmler still hadn&rsquo;t recovered from being scared silly by Reinhard Heydrich (medically murdered earlier that year on Himmler&rsquo;s orders, in a hospital, after being badly wounded by Czech Partisans,) so he let it slide.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m partly Scottish from a lowland, coastal area, I&rsquo;m certainly part Dane.  My German is good enough that I can read Danish for context.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just like a bully!  They pick on what looks like a weakling, and discover it has a history of being as tough as an old boot.</p>

<p>RK:  Well, well, well.  It only took them about thirty years to see what anybody with half a brain already knew before trying such silliness.</p>
<p>But thy&rsquo;re still far more brighter than the rest of Europe, especially, France, Germany and England, because those eggheads still think everything will work out fine if they push for more affirmative action.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe they need much more diversity to see the error of their ways, but even at that it&rsquo;s very likely the elites are just too dumb to learn, and it will be up to the people to take the matter into their own hands.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>Mr Scott errs:  &#8220;Danemark&#8221;  &mdash;   actually, &#8220;Dänemark&#8221;  &mdash;   is the German name, not the Danish.  The Danes call their land &#8220;Danmark&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m not sure older Danes would appreciate our using the Krauts&rsquo; term for them.  (tysk, tysk, so to speak)</p>
<p>This reminds me of Danny Kaye singing, seven years after the liberation of the city, &#8220;Wonderful, wonderful Kopen-HAH-gen&hellip;&#8221;  German again.   Of course, the English name for the city is Copen-HAY-gen.  Ironically, Kaye and the songwriter, Frank Loesser, were both Jewish.  </p>
<p>And the Danes&rsquo; name for their capital is København.  (Do not attempt to pronounce this without professional guidance.  You may injure your throat!)  It means &#8220;trade harbor&#8221;, or in strict English cognates, Cheaphaven.  Cheapside in London traces from the same root, and also refers to trade, not cheapness.</p>
<p>If a place is important enough to have a name in our language, we would really be doing them a favor by using it.  We call it &#8220;Belarus&#8221;, like a cheap knockoff of a snowmobile, while the Germans still say &#8220;Weißrußland&#8221;, or &#8220;Weissrussland&#8221;  &mdash;   &#8220;White Russia&#8221;, what we said in English 100 years ago.  And <span class="caps">NBC, CNN, USA</span> Today, and some others called the Olympic city &#8220;Torino&#8221; in English, as if it were some cheesy old Ford sedan.  The Dutch, however, still used their traditional name for the city, Turijn.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>It is also worth noting that Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has recently expressed her antipathy to the Islamicisation of Europe.  She is well respected for her intellectual qualities.  In May 2004 Crown Prince Frederik (heir to the thrown in Denmark) married Australia&rsquo;s Mary Donaldson (now Crown Prince Mary).  I am proud that both Australia and Denmark are linked in such a way, and hope we can combine with the rest of our white friends around the world to expunge the Islamic threat to our civilisation.   </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&ldquo;The British certainly had the means to silence colonial elites but no longer had the will. In 1937, Hitler explained to Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax how to control Indian nationalism: &lsquo;Shoot Gandhi, and if that does not suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of [the] Congress [movement]; and if that does not suffice, shoot 200 and so on until order is established.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next,</p>
<p>&ldquo;One incident from the final days of the Raj showed just how far the former rulers had fallen. While the last viceroy, Louis Mountbatten, was negotiating the final withdrawal, his wife Edwina was carrying on an affair with Jawaharlal Nehru, the most prominent nationalist after Gandhi, and India&rsquo;s future prime minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And finally this,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something else has changed even less: People who know nothing about non-whites still think they are experts on race relations. The less whites actually know, the more confidently they lecture other whites who have spent years among blacks or Asians. From the 1940s to the 1990s, Scandinavians who had never clapped eyes on a black told Americans and South Africans how to behave. Northerners berated Southerners with equal authority. Even today, the politicians and editorialists who bray the loudest about Southern or redneck &lsquo;racism&rsquo; live in gilded white ghettos and send their children to private schools. There is probably no other subject for which mouthing clichés passes for learning, and moral fervor trumps a lifetime of experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The points made above by Mr. Taylor are all excellent, I normally find very little to agree with Hitler upon but his above observations regarding Saint Gandhi and &ldquo;the Congress&rdquo; of his Apostles made to Lord Halifax are quite correct. Even the totally insane can make sense at times and here he is; put another way, Hitler is simply offering the observation that in making (or safeguarding) an empire, like an omelet, you have to break some eggs! The problem is easy enough to resolve and one need not gratuitously use bloodshed or bullets to any given degree; however, when the time comes: &ldquo;&hellip;go to the Jedi Temple, we will catch them off balance; do what must be done Lord Vader, do not hesitate, show no mercy&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, as Niccolo Machiavelli notes in The Price:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here a question arises: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or the reverse. The answer is, of course, that it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think about it in theses terms, had the black  riots of 1967 and beyond been vigorously suppressed with force, if say 100 to 1,000,000 of the &ldquo;civil disobedience&rdquo; terrorists and looters had been liquidated, while indulging in their &#8220;revolutions,&#8221; would these still be blackmail options against &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; today? Or, if every white politician from 1965 onward, had been monetarily sanctioned or even exiled for simply suggesting that immigration and other social &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; were morally and politically justified, would we be where we are today? What of early nitwitted white whores like &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; Mountbatten, if they had been treated as they deserved when detected, would we see their mindlessly &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; heirs walking about on the arms of the arrogantly grinning Nehru types of the earth and breeding with them today? I think not, but I could be wrong?</p>
<p>To ask another query in conjunction to the above, with ourselves as a paraphrased and perplexed collective Hamlet in mind is this, &lsquo;are we to be or not to be, that is the real question?&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is the crux of the matter that Mr. Taylor is addressing here. Are we to be like our past empires in the future as a people, bygone and venomously reviled; or moving forward in our own lands back to an assured betterment and continuance? And even more to the point, as a people who have lost so much in terms of both power and will, is this even possible still?</p>
<p>Of course it is!</p>
<p>But that is if we are willing to break the eggs and make the omelet?</p>
<p>So easy and in some ways so very bloodlessly it can be to do this, see the above article on the victories in Denmark titled  Denmark&rsquo;s Intifada, linked below:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2006/03/denmarks_intifa.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2006/03/denmarks_intifa.php</a></p>
<p>In other ways, things might get a bit more wet and sticky, but we would have to ask ourselves, is it worth it? I would say yes it is. For example, to exile the Bushes, or the Clintons to Mexico; or to put fat old Teddy Kennedy on trial for treason and then have him hung, well worth it in fact by my way of thinking. </p>
<p>But that is just my humble opinion of course?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even begin to expound on the Mexico &ldquo;question.&rdquo; </p>
<p>God help us all as a people, to awaken fully and help ourselves,</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Not only Denmark but also France, Germany and the Netherlands have been striking back hard against the Muslim dhimmis who want to take over Europe.  Germany in particular has enacted a tough immigration law recently that imposes heavy requirements on immigrants for skills and tendency to follow the laws, and openly discourages Muslims while encouraging more Eastern Europeans to immigrate.  France, interestingly, is now doing the same sort of thing.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in western Germany and Belgium before and I tell you, these are the places to be.  European culture in its grandest realization is around you everywhere you look.  Especially up in Bonn and other great cities in Germany, there&rsquo;s a civic pride of an order that you&rsquo;ll never find in the <span class="caps">US, </span>and a degree of productivity and efficiency that outpaces the selfish sluggishness of what we have on US shores.  Even in Spain, where I&rsquo;ve also worked and where the pace doesn&rsquo;t quite approximate the levels of northern Europe, there&rsquo;s a sense of national identity and civic pride that&rsquo;s enviable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about France and Italy, but in Germany and Belgium at least, it&rsquo;s important to remember that their biggest immigration sources have been from <strong>Eastern Europe</strong>, so those two countries have actually been benefiting from immigration waves.  There are something like 7 million Eastern Europeans resident in Germany and the number rises more and more every day.  Many of these are themselves ethnic Germans who had been in Eastern Europe for centuries, but most are native Poles, Czechs, Russians, Slovaks and Hungarians who admire the German culture and standards of living.  Even a large number of the Turks are blonde and blue-eyed in appearance  &mdash;   the descendants of the &#8220;white soldier armies&#8221; the sultans used to defend themselves, who are now returning home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d strongly encourage American Whites with pride in their culture to consider coming here too, for a prolonged visit or work if not outright immigration.  There are now almost 200,000 Americans and Canadians in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, so you&rsquo;ll have plenty of company, and you won&rsquo;t have to be ashamed about your White identity as media makes you do these days in the United States as a matter of course.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;In the end, I remain hopeful that if the Utopian States of Amerexico, can observer a Eurabia returning back to a secure whites only Europe and prospering, then perhaps we will come back to our senses and work our way back to being the United States of America,&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish that were the case, but while I do see a secure White Europe reemerging from Eurabia, I sense that Amerexico is lost beyond rescue.  Part of this is a little asterisk in the European immigration story that doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention, but that you do come to appreciate if you work in Europe for a while:  The vast, vast majority of immigrants to Europe in the past 30 years have not been from Muslim countries, but from Eastern Europe.  That&rsquo;s especially true in countries like Germany and Austria that are geographically close by, but even in France  &mdash;   where immigration stats aren&rsquo;t recorded outright  &mdash;   there&rsquo;s been some quiet admission (and relief) that the Romanians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Moldovans, Serbs and Russians have been a bigger demographic contributor than the North Africans.  Even among the North Africans, there are a surprising number of Whites  &mdash;   basically descendants of the Germanic tribes who migrated there in the 5th century  &mdash;   who are only weakly Muslim to begin with and have indeed become Frenchmen without too much trouble.  Look at French soccer star Zinedine Zidane for example, <a href="http://www.zidane.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zidane.fr/</a> who is North African but clearly with prominent Germanic features.</p>
<p>So Europe overall, especially Central Europe, is in good enough shape to stay together, and the recent tightening of immigration laws in the Netherlands, Germany and France (with strict regulations that discourage Muslim immigration and increase newcomers from Eastern Europe) is only going to assist this process further.  Western Europe&rsquo;s in decent shape.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">US, OTOH </span>is another matter.  The White birth rate in the <span class="caps">USA </span>has plummeted down to the levels of Italy in most parts of the country, while the black fertility rate remains above replacement level.  About 150,000 US blacks convert to Islam every year, with the rate rising so rapidly that most urban blacks will soon be Muslim.  The Mexican birth rate is the highest in the country, and California will soon have an outright Mexican majority, with Arizona not too far behind.  (To any Whites still out there in the SW  &mdash;   uh, why are you still there?)  </p>
<p>Like others have written, I think Whites in the US have two stark choices:  1. Move to secure, vast White-majority strongholds like the Mountain States, Pacific Northwest and most of the Midwest, as the country falls apart along ethnic lines and erupts in civil war, or 2. immigrate to Europe, especially Central Europe.  This is the only way to preserve our culture and identity against the coming onslaught in the <span class="caps">US, </span>which will likely transpire within 25 years or so at most.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something different in Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just stumbled upon an article from <span class="caps">BBC </span>site (Dec. 2005) about diversity training &#8220;Blue Eyes&#8221;, which apparently just crossed the ocean.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4521244.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4521244.stm</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, the British don&rsquo;t seem to be very keen on applying this, for fear that it will do more harm than good to the race relations at workplaces and don&rsquo;t speak about it nicely.</p>
<p><i>At the very least, we should consider the American lesson, say observers. If the spiralling millions of dollars spent in court on racial discrimination cases is anything to go by, the cumulative effect of diversity training could be more tension in the workplace, not less.</i></p>
<p>also there are good comments under the article:</p>
<p><i>I once told someone to stop lecturing me on racism as I was not racist. Her reply was &#8220;That&rsquo;s what I am trying to get through to you, not being racist is also a form of racism&#8221; If anyone can explain that I would be grateful.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>I don&rsquo;t share Sympathus Rex&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the waves of Eastern European migrants heading into Germany and other western European nations.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this all threatens the internal indigenous diversity of Europe.  I have no desire to see the ancient peoples and cultures of Europe merge into a single nothingness over time, which is what freedom of movement as part of the EU is going to bring about in the long run.  If you check out their site, this is something that the <span class="caps">BNP </span>in the UK feel strongly about also.  Eastern Europe should be for the Slavs, Germany should be for the Teutons.</p>
<p>Of course, we should all cooperate and tourism is all well and good, but not mass movements from east to west.  Most western Europeans, while clearly preferring eastern Europeans to the Third World hordes, are nevertheless not jumping up and down in excitement at their arrival, and would rather have them stay back in the east.  Witness the controversy in the lead up to the expansion of the EU to the East in May 2004 over free movement.  </p>
<p>The Americans on this site seem not to care about preserving the internal diversity of Europe (perhaps because they themselves are of mixed European heritage), and I saw one time ridiculous talk of how the ancient races of Europe should be melted down into one.  I completely disagree, and would echo ghw&rsquo;s comments elsewhere on this site (re British restriction of Third World migration in favour of eastern Europeans) about how unhealthy it is for eastern Europe itself that they are exporting so many of their youth.</p>
<p>While it is good that we in Europe have moved on from the old rivalries which devastated our continent in the past, we must take care not to go too far.     </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Keen Observer,</p>
<p>I actually <strong>do</strong> agree with your basic premise, as I bemoan the possibility of one big cultural gemisch in Europe and do very much prefer the distinct national and cultural identities of the different European nation-states.  That&rsquo;s in fact one of the reasons I like working in Europe so much, is the shared heritage in some respects but also fundamental distinctiveness of the cultures in different lands.  However, you worry too much about this possibility because it isn&rsquo;t happening  &mdash;   even as Eastern Europeans migrate westward, the cultures of Western European nations remain quite distinct.</p>
<p>Remember what I wrote in my post above  &mdash;   a fair number of the Eastern Europeans migrating to Germany and Austria these days are themselves of Teutonic heritage, such as the descendants of the Baltic Germans invited by Peter the Great into Russia, so there&rsquo;s obviously no cultural change there.  Also, despite the population shifts after <span class="caps">WWII, </span>large sections of many East European nations still have big German populations (as they have for many centuries before) who mix with those who don&rsquo;t trace their ancestry to Prussia necessarily, so there&rsquo;s inevitably been some ethnic and cultural blurring in much of the region anyhow.  In fact, the region from Eastern Germany and out to the Carpathians has had and continues to have a mixed Germanic-Slavic-Baltic character, a quite productive collaboration since <span class="caps">IMHO, </span>the people who make a living out there are some of the toughest and most productive that the White tribes have been able to boast.  The Eastern European immigration to Western Europe hasn&rsquo;t irrevocably altered Western Europe at all, as the newcomers just tend to take on more of the character of their host countries.  It&rsquo;s certainly preferable to the Third-World immigration to the <span class="caps">USA </span>which inevitably leads to our cities being overtaken by gangs and our wages being driven vigorously downward.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Sympathus Rex, thanks for your response.  You do raise some legitimate points, especially the age-old mix that there&rsquo;s always been in Central Europe between the Germans and Slavs.  Nevertheless, you seem to be focused on the cultural contours of Europe, and how those of western Europe aren&rsquo;t necessarily threatened by intra-European population movements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking in terms of blood, and actual ethnic differences between distinct peoples.  Does not the migration within Europe threaten the Anglo-Saxon essence of England, the Gaullist essence of France and the Flemish essence of Belgium and so on?  </p>
<p>I would strongly urge you (and anyone else who&rsquo;s interested for that matter) to read the piece regarding this issue, and the differences between racial and enthno-nationalism, on the <span class="caps">BNP&rsquo;</span>s site.  You may not agree with it, but I hope you&rsquo;ll find it some food for thought, and come across some interesting perspectives.  It&rsquo;s something I happen to strongly subscribe to.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a selection from the article: &#8220;A Spaniard, an Irishman and a German all look different, act different, create different cultures and have a unique genetic inheritance. They are all white and members of the White Race, but they all have their own unique genetic identity within the white race itself.</p>
<p>A Europe with no Anglo-Saxons, or Germans, or Poles, or Spaniards but just one misceginated mass of mixed up &#8216;white&rsquo; tribal genes is as much a racial disaster for Europe and our peoples as a Europe swamped with African genes.&#8221; </p>
