<h1>Statement by Michael J. Regan</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael J. Regan Press Release, March 7, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>First, I would like to say that I bear no ill will to Mr. Terry Parker, the Allegany County District Attorney. The people of Allegany County elected Mr. Parker to that important office, and entrusted him to make judgments as to what the best interests of that office are.  In this case, Mr. Parker decided that the best interests of the office required that my appointment as his assistant be revoked.</p>
<p>I consider it an honor to have served the people of Allegany County as an Assistant District Attorney.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On Saturday, February 25, 2006, I attended an academic conference in Herndon, Virginia that was hosted by the New Century Foundation. I am not a member of the New Century Foundation, nor do I subscribe to its publication, American Renaissance. I was aware that the Foundation was controversial because it is an advocacy group for European-Americans. I learned about the conference and its scheduled speakers though an anti-immigration website, VDare.com. The speakers included Mr. Jared Taylor, the President of the New Century Foundation, and two university professors from Canada and Australia.  I had no advance notice that any other person would be present. I listened to all of the scheduled speakers on Saturday. I agreed with some of the views expressed and disagreed with others.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the conference, a reporter from the Washington Post approached me and asked me what I thought, and what I did for a living. I told him I thought current immigration policy was adverse to the interests of European-American Christians. I made no derogatory remarks concerning any racial, ethnic or religious group.  I told the reporter what I did for a living. He did not misquote me and I stand by my statement.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>America rightly tolerates both religious and racial minorities. The United States Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion and equal protection of the law.</p>
<p>But our Constitution does not require, nor should it, that immigration transform America into a multicultural, multilingual or multireligious state. The recent riots in France are proof of the danger of uncontrolled and unassimilated immigration. The American values of racial and religious tolerance are not shared by all other national and religious groups. In order to protect these important American values, I believe Christians and European-Americans should retain their majority status in the United States.</p>
<p>The federal government&rsquo;s immigration policies are undermining that European Christian majority. In two of our largest states, California and Texas, non-Latino whites are already a minority. According to the Census, if immigration trends remain the same, European-Americans are projected to become a minority nationwide by the year 2050. The Supreme Court has ruled that it is Constitutional for States to discriminate against European-Americans in order to further diversity.</p>
<p>To counter these developments, I believe it is essential that European-Americans do what other ethnic or religious groups do, which is to organize in order to protect their own interests. But an insidious double standard discourages them from doing so. While the NAACP is encouraged to advocate for African-Americans, La Raza for Latino-Americans and the Anti-Defamation League for Jewish-Americans,  any organization or individual that advocates for European-Americans is denounced as being motivated by &ldquo;hate&rdquo; or &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; The media routinely targets such individuals for unfavorable publicity, and pressures those who employ or associate with them to fire them or otherwise distance themselves.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In my particular case, following some negative publicity, both the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP requested that adverse action be taken against my employment as a prosecutor. I believe their motive was to punish me for publicly associating with the New Century Foundation and for speaking my mind. I also believe they wanted to make an example of me in order to intimidate other persons who might express similar views. If everyone who disagrees with the current government policies is afraid to speak out, the government&rsquo;s policies will continue unopposed.</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP try to enforce the double standard because it benefits them. They are allowed to advocate on behalf of their racial or religious groups and yet seek to punish those who advocate for European-Americans. Would they denounce an African-American prosecutor who attended a meeting of the NAACP? That I was discharged as a prosecutor for doing what is in principle the same thing is further proof of the existence and enforcement of the double standard.</p>
<p>In response to media inquiries whether I would be removed from my post as an Adjunct Professor at Alfred University, the University&rsquo;s President, Dr. Charles Edmondson, stated that &ldquo;Alfred respects the rights of free expression outside the classroom.&rdquo; I appreciate his taking this principled stand.</p>
<p>But in the end, it does not matter that I was fired from one job or could be fired from another. For years now, I have exercised my Constitutional rights of free speech and free association to advocate for European-Americans. Nothing that has happened in the past and nothing that may happen in the future shall deter or dissuade me from continuing to do so.</p>
