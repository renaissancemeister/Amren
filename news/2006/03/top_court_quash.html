<h1>Top Court Quashes Sikh Dagger Ban</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Brown, Canadian Press, March 2, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>OTTAWA &mdash; The Supreme Court of Canada has struck down a Montreal school board&rsquo;s ban on the wearing of ceremonial daggers by Sikh students &mdash; delivering a ringing defence of religious freedom in the process. </p>
<p>In an 8-0 judgment Thursday, the court quashed a decision that barred teenager Gurbaj Singh Multani from attending class wearing the dagger, known as a kirpan. </p>
<p>The court left room for some restrictions on kirpans in the name of public safety. But a blanket ban goes too far and violates the Charter of Rights, wrote Justice Louise Charron. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A total prohibition against wearing kirpans to school undermines the value of this religious symbol and sends the message that some religious practices do not merit the same protection as others.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Religious tolerance lies &ldquo;at the very foundation of our democracy,&rdquo; Charron said, and schools must teach respect for minority groups and multicultural values. </p>
<p>Gurbaj Singh is now 17 and in his last year of high school, a private school that allows him to wear his kirpan. He acknowledged the five years it took for the case to get through the courts were stressful. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a little scared but the community supported me a lot, they stood by me shoulder by shoulder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful to them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The ruling will ease the way for younger students still in public schools in Quebec, he said. &ldquo;I feel very good that we won our rights.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A number of school districts in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario have long permitted the wearing of kirpans subject to certain conditions. </p>
<p>The rules often include a size limit on the dagger, or a requirement to keep it sheathed and to wear it under clothing and out of sight. </p>
<p>Those conditions are acceptable to the vast majority of orthodox Sikhs, said Palbinder Shergill, counsel for the Canadian branch of the World Sikh Organization. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope this decision will put that matter to rest once and for all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The judgment could also have an impact on other disputes &mdash; for example, the controversies that have erupted in some Quebec schools over the wearing of the hijab, the traditional Muslim head scarf for women. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court didn&rsquo;t directly address that issue Thursday. But the judges made it clear that schools must produce hard evidence to justify any curb on a sincerely held religious belief. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This decision does assist, I believe, in an interpretation that would permit the hijab in schools as well,&rdquo; said Shergill. </p>
<p>Orthodox Sikhs, who make up about 10 per cent of the estimated 250,000 Sikhs in Canada, are required by their religion to wear the kirpan at all times. </p>
<p>It symbolizes the fight for justice, but there are religious prohibitions on using it as a weapon. </p>
<p>Charron was scathing in rejecting a contention by school board lawyers that the dagger is emblematic of violence, calling that factually wrong and &ldquo;disrespectful to believers in the Sikh religion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Four other judges subscribed to Charron&rsquo;s reasoning, while three more reached the same conclusions by different legal means. </p>
<p>The Montreal dispute arose in 2001 when Gurbaj Singh, then aged 12, first wore his kirpan to school. </p>
<p>Authorities initially sought a compromise that would allow him to continue wearing the dagger. But the governing council of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board rejected that approach and imposed a total ban. </p>
<p>During a Supreme Court hearing last April, Julius Grey, the lawyer for the Multani family, noted there has never been a school assault committed with a kirpan anywhere in Canada. </p>
<p>Francois Aquin, the lawyer for the Montreal board, retorted that there have been no school assaults with kitchen knives either. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean we will allow students to carry kitchen knives in school.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The board issued a statement Thursday saying it was &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; with the court decision but would comply and explain the situation to parents. </p>
<p>The kirpan has sparked controversy not only in schools, but also in other public institutions, producing a patchwork of policies across the country. </p>
<p>Sikh MPs can wear kirpans in the House of Commons and visitors can wear them in the public galleries. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all right to wear them in the Supreme Court of Canada, but trial judges in some provinces have banned them from their courtrooms. </p>
<p>Most airlines once allowed passengers to wear kirpans, but in the security crackdown that followed the 9-11 terrorist attacks Transport Canada decreed a ban. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court judgment is confined to school situations and does not apply to other areas. &ldquo;Each environment is a special case,&rdquo; wrote Charron.</p>
