	<p>[Booker T. Washington&rsquo;s 1895 Address to the Atlanta Exposition urged that jobs should go to American blacks rather than to &#8220;those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits &hellip;&#8221;]</p>
<p><br>
Washington &mdash; As the NAACP gathers for its annual convention this weekend, the nation&rsquo;s oldest civil-rights group is increasingly joining forces with the newest minority power in American politics &mdash; Hispanics.</p>
<p>Supporters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People say working with Hispanics is crucial in maintaining relevance in an era when Hispanics, the fastest-growing minority, outnumber blacks.</p>
<p>But critics of the NAACP say the relationship has hurt the group&rsquo;s core constituency in the ongoing battle over immigration.</p>
<p>Frank Morris, chairman of Choose Black America, a group that favors strict immigration controls, said the NAACP has lost touch with the needs of low-income blacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leadership has really divorced itself from the African-American grass roots, who are really concerned about the high rates of illegal immigration,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The NAACP has joined with pro-immigration Hispanic groups to lobby for a more orderly, open-door immigration policy.</p>
<p>Economists debate the effect low-skilled, poorly educated illegal immigrants have on the ability of citizens to find jobs. But some studies suggest that blacks &mdash; who as a group tend to be poorer and have less formal education than whites &mdash; are hurt by the influx of immigrant workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the 2000 census showed that Hispanics had moved ahead of blacks as the nation&rsquo;s largest minority group, &ldquo;the media tried very hard to frame the growth as a competition between Latinos and blacks,&rdquo; said Cecilia Muoz, vice president for policy for National Council of La Raza, the country&rsquo;s largest Hispanic civil-rights group.</p>
<p>Instead of competition, she said, the two sides have increasingly found common ground on such issues as strong voting-rights protections, anti-discrimination laws, health-care access and equal education funding.</p>
<p>Bruce Gordon, who became NAACP president a year ago, spoke last month to the annual convention of the League of United Latin American Citizens, another Hispanic civil-rights group.</p>
