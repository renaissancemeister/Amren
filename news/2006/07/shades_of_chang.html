	<p>Washington &mdash; After years of battles over immigration, affirmative action, racial profiling and other issues, it appears that the United States is becoming a genuine melting pot. An interracial tide has transformed friendships, dating, cohabitations, marriages and adoptions in just one generation. </p>
<p>If the wave continues, it could begin to erode racial stereotypes and categories, as well as the rationale behind affirmative action and other broad protections for minorities. </p>
<p>The average American today, young or old, is 70 percent more likely than a generation ago to count a person of another race among his two or three best friends, according to an article in the current issue of <em>American Sociological Review.</em> </p>
<p>Minnesota has been a leader in such change for decades, dating back at least as far as the mid-20th century with the surge in the adoption of Korean children. By the year 2000, no large U.S. city anywhere other than on the intensely multiracial Pacific Coast had a higher share of multiracial children than Minneapolis. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never, ever, once been an issue for us,&rdquo; declared Tony Klaers of Minneapolis. </p>
<p>Klaers, who is white, has an extended family that includes two kids from a black-white marriage as well as adoptees from Korea and Vietnam. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had strange looks from others; but in my family it&rsquo;s no big deal.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Young people leading the way </strong></p>
<p>Young adults and children are the vanguard of the change: Consider 9-year-old Heshima Sikkenga of Apple Valley, for whom race &ldquo;is a minor point, like brown hair or blond hair,&rdquo; as his father, Steve, put it. </p>
<p>Match.com, a leading Internet dating service, says more young people are willing to date someone of another race. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing a lot more interracial couples,&rdquo; said Guatemala native Javier del Cid, a 32-year-old Washington bartender who has worked in restaurants for 18 years. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not scared anymore. You see a Hispanic guy with a black girl, you don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;Oh, my God!&rsquo; Only people raised before it was accepted say that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He should know &mdash; he said he dates mostly black women. A raft of research supports his observations. For example: </p>
<p>• In 1992, 9 percent of 18 &mdash; and 19-year-olds said they were dating someone of a different race. Ten years later, the figure was 20 percent, according to a 2005 study by sociologists Grace Kao of the University of Pennsylvania and Kara Joyner of Cornell University. </p>
<p>• In 1992, 9 percent of 20 &mdash; to 29-year-old Americans were living with people of different races. A decade later, that figure was 16 percent, Kao and Joyner said. </p>
<p>• In 1985, when asked to describe confidants with whom they&rsquo;d recently discussed an important concern, 9 percent of Americans named at least one person of a different race. These days, it&rsquo;s about 15 percent, according to Lynn Smith-Lovin of Duke University and Miller McPherson of the University of Arizona at Tucson, co-authors of the American Sociological Review article. </p>
<p>• In 1980, 1.3 percent of marriages in the United States were interracial, according to the Census Bureau. By 2002, that had more than doubled, to 3 percent. </p>
<p>• Eight percent of adoptions were interracial in 1987. By 2000, the number was 17 percent, according to Census demographer Rose Kreider. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1980, four out of five people in the United States were white; today that proportion is three out of four, mainly because of surges in Hispanic and Asian populations. </p>
<p>Those population shifts may be nudging along a general softening in attitudes about race. Today&rsquo;s circles of friends, for example, tend to be more racially mixed, primarily, Smith-Lovin said, &ldquo;because society is more diverse.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In 1990, two-thirds of Americans polled said they opposed having a close relation or family member marry a black person. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dropped to about one-third, according to Maria Krysan, a racial attitudes specialist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. </p>
<p>More integrated workplaces also have a lot to do with it, according to researchers. </p>
