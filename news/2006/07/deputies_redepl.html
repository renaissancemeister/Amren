<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca redeployed deputies to Compton on Tuesday in response to a bloody weekend that left four dead and numerous people wounded, including two young girls.</p>
<p>The move restores the additional staff Baca ordered into the gang-plagued city earlier this year after homicide levels in 2005 reached near-record rates. In recent weeks, sheriff&rsquo;s officials said, staffing had dwindled as some task force members were promoted or transferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly, the past week has shown that the community is not stable enough to sustain a reduction in staff,&rdquo; Baca said Tuesday. &ldquo;We have moved personnel back into Compton and we will keep them there &hellip; until we have a clear indication that the community is stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The violent weekend &mdash; which saw 20 gang-related shootings &mdash; capped several weeks of escalating gang activity in a city that had seen a dramatic drop in shootings and homicides since the task force was created in January.</p>
<p>Through early July, sheriff&rsquo;s officials said, there were 13 gang-related killings in Compton, compared to 38 for the same period the year before. Shootings were down by more than 50%. </p>
<p>As of Sunday, there had been 21 homicides in the city and another three killings within blocks of the city boundaries in unincorporated areas also patrolled by sheriff&rsquo;s deputies. Nearly all of the killings are thought to be gang-related. A year earlier, the total at this point in the year was 40 in the city and four nearby.</p>
<p>Baca said some of the recent violence appears to have been racially motivated &mdash; with black gang members attacking Latinos and Latino gang members attacking blacks. </p>
<p>He said the racial overtones have reinforced his belief that it would be &ldquo;morally wrong&rdquo; not to assist Compton despite the city&rsquo;s inability to pay for more deputies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question about it that the additional personnel have had a huge impact in blocking off opportunity and access to victims,&rdquo; he said, calling some of the attacks &ldquo;callously random.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to hit someone who is an innocent person, but that doesn&rsquo;t concern us at all.&rsquo; There are no rules of engagement with these gang members,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are reckless, wild and need to be stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the recent victims: two girls, ages 2 and 3, who were wounded in a drive-by shooting Friday night while playing in their family&rsquo;s frontyard.</p>
<p>The renewed level of violence stunned elected officials and residents who had hoped the downturn in crime would last.</p>
