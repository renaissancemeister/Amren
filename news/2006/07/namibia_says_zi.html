				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mail &amp; Guardian, July 21, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harare, Zimbabwe &mdash; Namibia&rsquo;s justice minister has praised Zimbabwe&rsquo;s controversial programme of farm seizures, saying newspapers that run negative stories about the country are taken over by forces opposed to the success of Africanism, it was reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaking during a tour of three Zimbabwe farms allocated to black farmers, Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana said there was too much propaganda against the country, the government&rsquo;s Herald newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came to Zimbabwe I was looking for chaos, disorder, lawlessness and rampant human rights abuse. I was surprised to see people working, some of them on their farms,&rdquo; the minister said. </p>
<p>Namibia has recently embarked on its own programme of land reforms, and says it sees Zimbabwe as a role model for the way land reform can be carried out.</p>
<p>President Robert Mugabe launched his programme of white land seizures in 2000. Only a few hundred white farmers are now left on the land, out of more than 4 000 six years ago.</p>
<p>The programme has been wracked with controversy, following allegations that well-connected members of the ruling party cherry-picked the best farms, often for use as weekend retreats.</p>
<p>Agricultural production has taken a nosedive, turning a country once known as the breadbasket of Southern African into a struggling food importer.</p>
<p>Mugabe blames the drop in production upon repeated drought, but some senior government officials &mdash; including vice-president Joseph Msika &mdash; have dared to suggest that land wasn&rsquo;t always given to people with an interest in farming.</p>
<p>Namibia&rsquo;s justice minister told the Herald she was very pleased to have been brought to see the farms. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is too much propaganda against Zimbabwe. I keep on repeating, our media from all over Namibia, South Africa are all taken by forces opposed to the success of Africanism,&rdquo; Iivula-Ithana said.</p>
<p>The authorities in Zimbabwe also regularly allege that they are the victim of a hostile Western media plot, and there are strict media laws in place to try to control which reporters are allowed to work there.<br>

											<p>
							<i>Independent Foreign Service, July 14, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Criminal charges have been laid against more than 200 Namibian companies which have failed to comply with the country&rsquo;s affirmative action Act, which came into effect in 1998. </p>
<p>Namibia&rsquo;s Employment Equity Commission (EEC), which is tasked by law to monitor the implementation of the Act in order to achieve a workforce representative of the broader Namibian society, said this week that the Office of the Prosecutor General and the police had been roped in to bring the culprits to book. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner (rather) than later, the relevant employers will appear before court. It&rsquo;s not something we want to do, but once it happens, it will send the right message to the rest,&rdquo; said EEC Commissioner Vilbard Usiku. </p>
<p>Those who violate the Act for the first time could be fined R4 000 or be jailed for a year, while second-time offenders face fines of up to R100 000 or a jail term of five years, or both. </p>
<p>Labour Minister Alpheus Naruseb announced that the threshold for companies to submit affirmative action reports has been lowered from 50 or more employees to 25 or more. </p>
<p>That means that all companies which employ 25 or more employees will have to submit affirmative action progress reports. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am informed by the Employment Equity Commission that some of the relevant employers identified in 1999 did not submit their affirmative action plan and report as required by the law. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The ministry of labour will leave no stone unturned in its efforts to identify the culprits so that they are brought to book,&rdquo; Naruseb said. </p>
<p>In a recent report tabled in the national assembly, the EEC identified 213 cases of non-compliance, of which 155 cases were opened with the police. </p>
<p>Most companies failing to comply with the affirmative action law requirements have blamed it on the lack of skills among the previously-disadvantaged groups. </p>
<p>Recently, ruling Swapo party parliamentarian and Minister of Youth John Mutorwa said the EEC needed to be given more teeth. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We (government) shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as helpless. We have the law but with certain limitations. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us strengthen the hand of the institutions we have created to deal with the issues,&rdquo; Mutorwa told the national assembly. </p>
<p>Usiku said it was becoming increasingly apparent that there were attempts to limit advances of black Namibians at management levels and that this &ldquo;shows a blatant disregard for the spirit and provisions of the Act&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Opposition Congress of Democrats leader Ben Ulenga said some companies were paying lip service to the implementation of affirmative action while others simply refused to comply with the law. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In many of the positions where decisions regarding change are supposed to be made and where change is expected to be effected, no change is occurring. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The same stagnation infects just too many middle management and professional occupations at many companies in the private sector,&rdquo; Ulenga said. </p>
<p>Some of the &ldquo;old traditional Namibian companies&rdquo; have no single black person, woman or disabled person in their executive, senior and middle management, he said. </p>
<p>Many others, he said, employed blacks for window dressing.<br>
