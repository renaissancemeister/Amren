<h1>&lsquo;Benefits Of G-Had&rsquo;: Muslim Rapper&rsquo;s Album Raises Eyebrows In Britain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damien Steffan, AFP, July 21, 1986</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>London &mdash; With a title like &ldquo;All Is War (The Benefits of G-Had)&rdquo; and a song about a suicide bomber, a new album by British Muslim rapper Aki Nawaz has raised eyebrows before its release, even at his own record label. </p>
<p>The Pakistan-born rapper&rsquo;s group Fun-Da-Mental were set to put the new disc on sale July 17, 10 days after the first anniversary of the London bombings.</p>
<p>But its words and themes &mdash; another predicting US decline at the hands of Muslims &mdash; caused two directors at Nation Records to threaten to quit if &ldquo;All Is War&rdquo; hit the shops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m doing, everything I did was intentional,&rdquo; a determined Nawaz told AFP.</p>
<p>The release was held off, but Nation now says the album will come out online on August 7, then go on sale in stores on either August 14 or 21.</p>
<p>Nawaz named the two who threatened to resign as Andrew Heath and Martin Mills, silent partners at Nation. A spokesperson for Mills&rsquo;s separate record label, Beggars Banquet, however said they would make no comment &ldquo;at all&rdquo; on the matter.</p>
<p>For a group that has not tasted mainstream success, Fun-Da-Mental&rsquo;s new album has generated plenty of media coverage.</p>
<p>On the track list are titles like &ldquo;I Reject&rdquo;, &ldquo;Electro G-Had&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cookbook DIY&rdquo;, the last the voice of a suicide bomber that &mdash; given the timing &mdash; brings to mind the four, home-grown bombers who killed 56 people and wounded about 700 more in last July&rsquo;s attacks on the London transport network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elements everyday chemicals at my reach;</p>
<p>Household bleach to extract the potassium;</p>
<p>Chlorate boiling on a hotplate with hate;</p>
<p>recipe for disaster plastic bomb blaster &hellip; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m strapped up cross my chest bomb belt attached;</p>
<p>deeply satisfied with the plan I hatched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a twist, the ambiguous rap ends by referring to a government-paid scientist with a &ldquo;private room in the White House suite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Another song, &ldquo;786 All is War&rdquo;, predicts the downfall of the United States at the hands of its citizens who call in Muslims to liberate the country.</p>
<p>One track compares the speeches of Latin American revolutionary Che Guevara and Osama bin Laden, head of the Al-Qaeda terror network, attempting to show the two shared a similar drive to resist imperialism.</p>
<p>Nawaz stressed that the Bin Laden speeches he used dated from before Al-Qaeda&rsquo;s September 2001 attacks on the United States. </p>
<p>The rapper, in his early forties with flowing black hair, hails from Bradford in northern England, an industrial town with a significant Muslim population which witnessed race riots between whites and South Asians in 2001. </p>
<p>He simply claims a right to challenge mainstream beliefs and establishment propaganda. </p>
<p>The New Musical Express weekly once dubbed Nawaz as less like a Pakistani version of Johnny Rotten, the guitarist for the iconic punk group Sex Pistols, and more like Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, the unhinged rogue in the 1979 film &ldquo;Apocalypse Now&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that my whole purpose is to stop the nonsense that is going on and create the right debate within the limits of art. I have the right to speak up and speak loud about injustices everywhere,&rdquo; Nawaz told AFP. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We see people writing books about the global conflicts, we see films, documentaries, everybody&rsquo;s on about the issues so why can&rsquo;t I sing about them? </p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold Pinter (the 2005 Nobel literature prize winner), he said (British Prime Minister) <br>
Tony Blair is a war criminal and should be tried in a criminal court. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I am saying because I think he&rsquo;s a war criminal with blood on his hands. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But people are saying to me, &lsquo;everybody else is allowed to say what they wish but Muslims are not allowed to say what they want because they face being arrested&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Defiantly, he asks: &ldquo;This is a democracy &mdash; is it such just for white folks, and fascism for everybody else?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Nawaz said he is primed for accusations of inciting violence and to see himself branded an apologist for Islamist militants. </p>
<p>But he insisted that the only thing he was inciting was for people to question Western society around them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something that the West has to deal with. People say: &lsquo;If the Holocaust came now we&rsquo;d never allow it&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s happening in front of our eyes. People are locked away, are being unjustifiably demonised and no-one&rsquo;s speaking out. </p>
<p>&ldquo;By speaking out, we&rsquo;re not supporting any form of terrorism &mdash; and that includes state terrorism,&rdquo; Nawaz said. </p>
<p>Fun-Da-Mental had suggested it was ready to bring &ldquo;All Is War&rdquo; out under another label if its release would cause Nation Records&rsquo; collapse, and thus hurt other artists with Nation. </p>
<p>But Nawaz never considered scotching the album. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m determined to bring it out. I think it&rsquo;s a work of passion,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a soundtrack to what is going on around us, the reality that everyone knows about &mdash; there&rsquo;s nothing in there that the common man doesn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<br>
