<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0706/p09s01-coop.html">How Eisenhower Solved Illegal Border Crossings From Mexico</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Dillin, Christian Science Monitor, July 6, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>George W. Bush isn&rsquo;t the first Republican president to face a full-blown immigration crisis on the US-Mexican border.</p>
<p>Fifty-three years ago, when newly elected Dwight Eisenhower moved into the White House, America&rsquo;s southern frontier was as porous as a spaghetti sieve. As many as 3 million illegal migrants had walked and waded northward over a period of several years for jobs in California, Arizona, Texas, and points beyond.</p>
<p>President Eisenhower cut off this illegal traffic. He did it quickly and decisively with only 1,075 United States Border Patrol agents - less than one-tenth of today&rsquo;s force. The operation is still highly praised among veterans of the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>Although there is little to no record of this operation in Ike&rsquo;s official papers, one piece of historic evidence indicates how he felt. In 1951, Ike wrote a letter to Sen. William Fulbright (D) of Arkansas. The senator had just proposed that a special commission be created by Congress to examine unethical conduct by government officials who accepted gifts and favors in exchange for special treatment of private individuals.</p>
<p>General Eisenhower, who was gearing up for his run for the presidency, said &#8220;Amen&#8221; to Senator Fulbright&rsquo;s proposal. He then quoted a report in The New York Times, highlighting one paragraph that said: &#8220;The rise in illegal border-crossing by Mexican &#8216;wetbacks&rsquo; to a current rate of more than 1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although an on-and-off guest-worker program for Mexicans was operating at the time, farmers and ranchers in the Southwest had become dependent on an additional low-cost, docile, illegal labor force of up to 3 million, mostly Mexican, laborers.</p>
<p>According to the Handbook of Texas Online, published by the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas State Historical Association, this illegal workforce had a severe impact on the wages of ordinary working Americans. The Handbook Online reports that a study by the President&rsquo;s Commission on Migratory Labor in Texas in 1950 found that cotton growers in the Rio Grande Valley, where most illegal aliens in Texas worked, paid wages that were &#8220;approximately half&#8221; the farm wages paid elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p>Profits from illegal labor led to the kind of corruption that apparently worried Eisenhower. Joseph White, a retired 21-year veteran of the Border Patrol, says that in the early 1950s, some senior US officials overseeing immigration enforcement &#8220;had friends among the ranchers,&#8221; and agents &#8220;did not dare&#8221; arrest their illegal workers.</p>
<p>Walt Edwards, who joined the Border Patrol in 1951, tells a similar story. He says: &#8220;When we caught illegal aliens on farms and ranches, the farmer or rancher would often call and complain [to officials in El Paso]. And depending on how politically connected they were, there would be political intervention. That is how we got into this mess we are in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the 1950s, however, this &#8220;Good Old Boy&#8221; system changed under Eisenhower - if only for about 10 years.</p>
<p>In 1954, Ike appointed retired Gen. Joseph &#8220;Jumpin&rsquo; Joe&#8221; Swing, a former West Point classmate and veteran of the 101st Airborne, as the new INS commissioner.</p>
<p>Influential politicians, including Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D) of Texas and Sen. Pat McCarran (D) of Nevada, favored open borders, and were dead set against strong border enforcement, Brownell said. But General Swing&rsquo;s close connections to the president shielded him - and the Border Patrol - from meddling by powerful political and corporate interests.</p>
<p>One of Swing&rsquo;s first decisive acts was to transfer certain entrenched immigration officials out of the border area to other regions of the country where their political connections with people such as Senator Johnson would have no effect.</p>
<p>Then on June 17, 1954, what was called &#8220;Operation Wetback&#8221; began. Because political resistance was lower in California and Arizona, the roundup of aliens began there. Some 750 agents swept northward through agricultural areas with a goal of 1,000 apprehensions a day. By the end of July, over 50,000 aliens were caught in the two states. Another 488,000, fearing arrest, had fled the country.</p>
<p>By mid-July, the crackdown extended northward into Utah, Nevada, and Idaho, and eastward to Texas.</p>
<p>By September, 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas, and an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 illegals had left the Lone Star State voluntarily.</p>
<p>Unlike today, Mexicans caught in the roundup were not simply released at the border, where they could easily reenter the US. To discourage their return, Swing arranged for buses and trains to take many aliens deep within Mexico before being set free.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands more were put aboard two hired ships, the Emancipation and the Mercurio. The ships ferried the aliens from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico, more than 500 miles south.</p>
<p>The sea voyage was &#8220;a rough trip, and they did not like it,&#8221; says Don Coppock, who worked his way up from Border Patrolman in 1941 to eventually head the Border Patrol from 1960 to 1973.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One day in 1954, Border Patrol agent Walt Edwards picked up a newspaper in Big Spring, Texas, and saw some startling news. The government was launching an all-out drive to oust illegal aliens from the United States.</p>
<p>The orders came straight from the top, where the new president, Dwight Eisenhower, had put a former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, in charge of immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>General Swing&rsquo;s fast-moving campaign soon secured America&rsquo;s borders - an accomplishment no other president has since equaled. Illegal migration had dropped 95 percent by the late 1950s.</p>
