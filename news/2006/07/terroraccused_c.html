				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natasha Robinson, The Australian, July 25, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Suburban Islamic cleric Abdul Nacer Benbrika wanted to kill 1000 Australians to &ldquo;please Allah&rdquo; and had the support of a blond-haired recruit who had pledged violent jihad during a meeting with Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>A Melbourne court heard yesterday that a witness would reveal that Shane Kent, 29, received weapons and explosives training at the Taliban-run al-Faruq training camp for foreign jihadis in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>And at a meeting with bin Laden in the country, Mr Kent, from Meadow Heights in Melbourne&rsquo;s north, allegedly committed to violent jihad. The alleged Melbourne terror cell&rsquo;s spiritual leader, Mr Benbrika embraced Mr Kent as part of his clique, the court heard, saying: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good, and he doesn&rsquo;t talk too much.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Benbrika encouraged his devotees to plan a large-scale terrorist attack, which police foiled during its &ldquo;developmental stages&rdquo;, the court heard during the opening day of the committal hearing of 13 suspects yesterday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If you kill, we kill here 1000,&rdquo; Mr Benbrika allegedly said in a conversation covertly taped by police. &ldquo;Because if you get large numbers here, the government will listen.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The court heard yesterday that the group was making plans for a backyard explosives laboratory, had held secret training camps and was found with an armoury of weapons and bomb-making manuals. </p>
<p>And some members of the alleged terror cell were anxious to carry out an attack. </p>
<p>According to the police surveillance, Abdulla Merhi, 21, said he &ldquo;could wait months but not years&rdquo; to carry out violent jihad. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t kill just one, two or three,&rdquo; Mr Benbrika allegedly responded. &ldquo;Do a big thing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Madrid?&rdquo; Mr Merhi asked, to which Mr Benbrika allegedly replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Twelve of the accused &mdash; Mr Kent, Mr Merhi, Izzydeen Atik, Ahmed Raad, Bassam Raad, Ezzit Raad, Majed Raad, Amer Haddara, Aimen Joud, Fadal Sayadi, Hany Taha and Shoue Hammoud &mdash; are charged with being members of a terrorist organisation which Mr Benbrika is alleged to have directed. </p>
<p>They face a range of other charges including making funds available to a terrorist organisation, providing support to a terrorist organisation, and possessing a thing connected with a terrorist act. </p>
<p>Some of the charges carry a maximum prison term of 25 years. </p>
<p>Mr Benbrika is also charged with directing the activities of a terrorist organisation and recruiting a person to join a terrorist organisation. </p>
<p>Ezzit Raad discussed the London train bombings of last year with spiritual leader Mr Benbrika, the court heard, complaining that the death toll was not large enough and that &ldquo;it should have been more&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Sitting in the high-security Victorian County Court building yesterday, the Magistrates Court heard that one member of the group had placed a large order for laboratory equipment. </p>
<p>The equipment was allegedly intended for use in the manufacture of explosives using chemicals bought by Sydney terror suspects, who were arrested simultaneously in joint counter-terrorism raids last year. </p>
<p>A bomb-making manual called The Vortex Cookbook, and decrees setting out the rules of violent jihad, were allegedly uncovered at suspects&rsquo; homes during police raids before the arrest of the 13 men in November in the combined-agency counter-terrorism Operation Pendennis. </p>
<p>Religious handbooks found allegedly included one entitled The Islamic Ruling with Regard to the Killing of Women, Children and the Elderly in a Situation of War, and another called The Virtues of Martyrdom in the Path of Allah. </p>
<p>The organisation was &ldquo;inspired and influenced by al-Qaeda and the teachings of Osama bin Laden&rdquo;, said prosecutor Mark Dean, opening the case yesterday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The organisation was motivated by a belief that the world Islamic community is under attack from non-Islamic forces. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The interpretation of Islam followed by the defendants was a militant and extreme version, and in part characterised by the use of intended violence against those who did not share their views.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Firearms including rifles and pistols were found at the homes of some of the accused during police raids, the court heard. </p>
<p>Members of the cell attended a training camp with the Sydney accused at a remote location near Louth in far northwestern NSW in March last year, the court was told yesterday. </p>
<p>A team-building operation allegedly took place at a camp near Eden, on the NSW south coast, in October 2004, and other training camps were allegedly held at Kinglake and Ocean Grove, on Melbourne&rsquo;s northeast and southwest outskirts. </p>
<p>Members of the Melbourne group allegedly contributed $100 a month each to a fund used to finance their terrorism plans. </p>
<p>Group members were involved in car rebirthing, credit-card fraud and selling stolen mobile phones to finance their terror plans, Mr Dean said. </p>
<p>During a police raid in June last year, $18,355 in cash was found at the home of Ahmed Raad, the court heard. </p>
<p>Only seven of the accused were present yesterday morning, with Mr Kent arriving in the afternoon after a &ldquo;misunderstanding&rdquo; with guards resulted in him being left behind at the maximum-security Barwon prison, near Geelong, a three-hour drive from Melbourne. </p>
<p>While about 25 civil libertarian protesters held placards outside the court demanding that the men be released, Mr Benbrika refused to attend yesterday. </p>
<p>His barrister, Ashley Halphin, told the court his client had been assaulted during transport to or from a previous court hearing. </p>
<p>The hearing before Chief Magistrate Paul Smith was adjourned and will resume on Friday. </p>
