<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Zimbabwe has lifted a ban on the practice of witchcraft, repealing legislation dating back to colonial rule.</p>
<p>From July the government acknowledges that supernatural powers exist &mdash; but prohibits the use of magic to cause someone harm.</p>
<p>In 1899, colonial settlers made it a crime to accuse someone of being a witch or wizard &mdash; wary of the witch hunts in Europe a few centuries earlier which saw many people burned at the stake after such accusations.</p>
<p>But to most Zimbabweans, especially those who grew up in the rural areas, it has been absurd to say that the supernatural does not exist.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not hard to find vivid stories about the use of magic.</p>
<p>Alfred, for example, believes that he was bewitched at work some years ago, making him partly bald.</p>
<p>He described how after supper one evening as he and his wife were retiring to bed his hair disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my wife came into the bedroom she look at me and said, &lsquo;What happened to your hair? Where&rsquo;s it gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She saw a bald patch from the forehead going back on the side of the head. There was no trace of it,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>He spent seven months visiting traditional healers to make it grow back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made some incisions round the bald patch, put some powdery muti (medicine) and lo and behold within a few day the hair had grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Fetishes</strong></p>
<p>There are many other accounts of the use of magic, and the new law effectively legitimises many practices of traditional healers.</p>
<p> These include rolling bones to foretell the future, divination, attempts to communicate with the dead, using muti &mdash; traditional powders and fetishes &mdash; to ensure the desired sex of a child.</p>
<p>But there will be some legal grey areas, like whether it is legal for a husband to place some charms in his bedroom &mdash; charms that may injure his wife if she is unfaithful.</p>
<p>Professor Claude Mararikei &mdash; a sociologist and the chairman of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Traditional Medical Practitioner&rsquo;s Council &mdash; argues that witchcraft has some positive benefits in the modern world.</p>
<p>He cites the example of a man who stole some bewitched cement that became stuck to the thief&rsquo;s shoulders so he could not remove the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if you have that knowledge to capture a thief in a cattle kraal when he comes for the cows, well and good. It&rsquo;s like electrifying the fence round your house,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Waste of time&rsquo;</p>
<p>Others believe that the country would be better off without elevating the supernatural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a waste of time and energy. The urban areas are not really caught up in these supernatural issues,&rdquo; says social commentator Thomas Deve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claims of witchcraft need to be investigated instead of putting down every disorder in society that is taking in our society to witchcraft or modern magic,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
<p>The church in Zimbabwe has always believed that witchcraft exists, but it has been careful to establish the source of such supernatural powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Christians we&rsquo;ve got to recognise that supernatural forces are good if they originate from God &mdash; now witchcraft is one of the things that originates from the Satanic world,&rdquo; says Reverend Roy Musasiwa who runs a theological college in the capital, Harare.</p>
<p>The Witchcraft Suppression Act was used fairly frequently, but prosecuting someone under the new legislation may prove difficult.</p>
<p>The new Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act will demand proof that a person has supernatural powers and that they are using them to harm others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be easy task,&rdquo; says Custom Kachambwa, a judge with years of experience in the legal field.</p>
<p>He says witnesses will often be traditional healers, who could be accused of practising harmful magic in the future.</p>
<p>But whatever the problems, the repealing of the witchcraft laws is another sign that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s government is continuing to move away from Western values and placing more emphasis on the country&rsquo;s own traditions. </p>
