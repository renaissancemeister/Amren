						<p>Chuck Baldwin&rsquo;s Interview With Jerome Corsi, PhD</p>
<p>Related links provided at bottom of article.</p>
<p>_______</p>
<p>Jerome Corsi conducted an excellent investigation into the upcoming &ldquo;North American Union.&rdquo; Corsi broke ground that the mainstream media continue to ignore. With respect to border issues, illegal immigration, U.S. trade policy, national security and the integrity of the nation-state of America, his conclusions are ominous.</p>
<p>Corsi writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP), signed by President Bush with Mexico and Canada in Waco, Tex., on March 23, 2005, was fundamentally an agreement to erase our borders with Mexico and Canada. &hellip; The SPP &lsquo;working groups&rsquo; organized within the U.S. Department of Transportation are signing trilateral memoranda of understanding and other agreements with Mexico and Canada designed to accomplish the open borders goal incrementally, below the radar of mainstream media attention, thereby avoiding public scrutiny. Congress is largely unaware that SPP exists, let alone knowledgeable about the extensive work being done behind the scenes by the executive branch to advance the agenda articulated by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) to establish a North American Union as a new regional super-government by 2010.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This CFR document, called &ldquo;Building a North American Community,&rdquo; asserts that George W. Bush, Mexican President Vicente Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin &ldquo;committed their governments&rdquo; to the goal of North American integration when they met at Bush&rsquo;s ranch and at Waco, Texas, on March 23, 2005. The three adopted the &ldquo;Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America&rdquo; and assigned &ldquo;working groups&rdquo; to fill in the details.</p>
<p>The CFR&rsquo;s &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; strategy calls for &ldquo;a more open border for the movement of goods and people.&rdquo; The SPP Web site is almost verbatim the CFR outline for the North American Union. It also declares creation of a &ldquo;common security perimeter&rdquo; that will require us to &ldquo;harmonize visa and asylum regulations&rdquo; with Mexico and Canada.</p>
<p>A precursor to the &ldquo;Summit of the Americas&rdquo; at Waco in 2005: Before the events of 9/11 stopped him, President George W. Bush signed the Declaration of Quebec City on April 22, 2001, which was a &ldquo;commitment to hemispheric integration.&rdquo; It was full of overblown rhetoric and it has been followed up by many speeches including his second inaugural address in 2005 – all of them loaded with U.N. double talk such as &ldquo;interdependent,&rdquo; &ldquo;greater economic integration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainable development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No More Borders – No More United States of America</p>
<p>Corsi figured out not long ago why nothing is being done about the porous borders and the reason why George W. Bush and the establishment shakers and movers want open borders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Additionally, when it comes to immigration and trade issues, you can count on U.S. efforts to protect itself from a human tide of illegal migration and bad trade deals being overturned by a supranational trade-related court or tribunal that will routinely and inevitably expand its power and scope. Meanwhile, count on Congress to stick its collective head in the sand.</p>
<p>Follow the Yellow Brick Road to Utopia</p>
<p>The SPP Web site is pretty clear on the effort to remake three sovereign nations: &ldquo;The SPP builds upon, but is separate from, our long-standing trade and economic relationships. It energizes other aspects of our cooperative relations, such as the protection of our environment, our food supply, and our public health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It also calls for the free movement of people and goods across borders. This is one of several reasons you and I are never going to see a workable border security plan or an end to illegal immigration come out of the Bush administration. It won&rsquo;t be necessary once the &ldquo;plan&rdquo; is implemented in full in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once more, we are witnessing an uncaring, uninformed George W. Bush rule by fiat, claiming powers to himself and the executive branch which cannot be found in the Constitution except through a disgraceful interpretation of the commerce clause.</p>
<p>I strongly urge you to read the documents on the SPP Web site, as well as Corsi&rsquo;s series on the NAU. Also important are the working papers of the CFR on &ldquo;Building a North American Community,&rdquo; and American University&rsquo;s Richard Pastor on the same topic. These efforts are both illuminating and scary, to say the least.</p>
<p>I also urge you to pay attention to what your elected representatives, particularly those in the U.S. Senate, do. Forget partisan squabbles or tiffs involving &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; or &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; celebrities and newspeople. The nation is being lost because we are being sidetracked by rubbish that does not amount to a hill of beans.</p>
<p>Demand the Congress to stop the NAU from being more than one more awful, destructive economic agreement the leaders of the U.S. routinely sign.</p>
<p>Your freedom, country and system depend on what you do now.</p>
