						<p>[Note: Initial report of the arrests below.]</p>
<p>Lockport &mdash; Four teenagers charged in the gang rape of a disabled classmate in May have been released from jail, and family members of the suspects said during a hearing Wednesday that the charges are racially motivated. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Would we be here if the girl was black, too?&rdquo; said the legal guardian of suspect Dartain M. Ubiles, who declined to give her name. She noted the victim is white, while the four suspects, all 16, are black. </p>
<p>The woman also said the four &mdash; Dontre Woods of Lock Street; Ubiles of Frontier Street, Niagara Falls; Nicholas Smith of Crosby Avenue; and Antonio J. Sheppard of Gabriel Drive &mdash; were forced to sign statements at Lockport High School to avoid being suspended. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They turned [the boys against] each other without involving the parents,&rdquo; the guardian said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detective Capt. Lawrence Eggert said skin color has absolutely nothing to do with this case. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All I care about is the law. I didn&rsquo;t know who was black and who was white. For 26 years I&rsquo;ve worked hard to be fair. To call this a racial issue is ridiculous. This case will stand or fall on its own merit.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Rev. Mark Sanders, a Lockport community policing aide and local pastor, said the four boys are themselves victims. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think all the facts are not out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These boys have already been demonized and tried. It&rsquo;s wrong to make a judgment before all sides have been heard.&rdquo; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all broken up,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;They come from good homes. They are athletes who box and play football. These are not thugs from the street. None of them have ever been in jail.&rdquo; Sanders said he also sympathized with the 15-year-old girl and called her situation traumatizing. &ldquo;My heart is broken. Sexuality is a big problem for teens,&rdquo; Sanders said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ubiles&rsquo; mother, Katrina, who declined to reveal her last name, said, &ldquo;This incident should never have gotten this far. They&rsquo;ve got them scared. None of this is true.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sheppard was freed on bail Tuesday. The other three were freed Wednesday on their own recognizance. </p>
<p>The four, who were ordered to stay away from the girl and stay out of trouble as a condition of their release, are scheduled to return to court at 9 a.m. Aug. 30. <br>

															<h2>Four Teens Charged In Lockport Gang Rape</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Nancy A. Fischer, News Niagara Bureau, July 26, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Lockport &mdash; Four 16-year-old youths are charged in the gang rape in May of a 15-year-old disabled girl at the home of one of the boys. </p>
<p>Police say the attackers violated the girl and recorded the assault with a cell phone camera. </p>
<p>The charges followed a two-month investigation by Lockport Police Lt. David Barrancotta. </p>
<p>The teens befriended the girl then lured her to the home of one of the attackers May 12, where they took turns attacking her over an hour and a half, said Detective Capt. Lawrence Eggert. </p>
<p>He said the victim and the suspects were students at Lockport High School. </p>
<p>The four charged are: Dontre R. Woods of Lock Street, where the attack occurred; Dartain M. Ubiles of Frontier Street, Niagara Falls; Nicholas M. Smith of Crosby Avenue; and Antonio J. Sheppard of Gabriel Drive. </p>
<p>Two were charged with first-degree forcible rape and three youths were charged with felony first-degree criminal sexual act. A fourth youth was charged with videotaping the attack on his cell phone. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eggert said the cell phone was confiscated by police, but noted that a 30-second video clip of the rape was erased. He said Sheppard admitted to police that he had taped the other youths raping the girl. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure if the video was widely seen by other people, but we did receive some notification from others that the video existed,&rdquo; Eggert said. </p>
<p>Kelly Campbell, captain of the Lock Street Block Club, a neighbor of the Woods family, said she was sad about what happened to the girl, but was also sad for the four youths. </p>
<p>&ldquo;None of these kids would have done this on his own. I don&rsquo;t think they are that kind of kids, but they made a huge mistake, which will affect their whole lives,&rdquo; Campbell said. </p>
<p>She blamed both raging hormones and children in the blighted area having nowhere to redirect their energy. </p>
