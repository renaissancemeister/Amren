						<p>Manchester &mdash; The screams and explosions rocking Tom Barlow&rsquo;s television speakers round the doorway from his second-floor studio apartment and echo down the hall. </p>
<p>Barlow, 36, is fully relaxed with his door propped open. On a rainy afternoon, he leans against the wall with his shirt off and his feet bare, a cigarette smoldering in the ashtray an arm&rsquo;s length away. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very tolerant building,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;People have open minds.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Barlow was raised just down the road from this building near Kalivas Park, two blocks east of Manchester&rsquo;s downtown strip. Back then, the neighborhood was predominantly Greek. Growing up, Barlow said, nearly everyone he knew was white. </p>
<p>Today, Barlow is living in one of the city&rsquo;s most ethnically diverse buildings. His floor alone is home to several Africans, including Sudanese, Congolese and a college student from Burundi. Some of his neighbors are from Bosnia. One man, a 41-year-old living thousands of miles from his wife and two children, is from Iran. </p>
<p>All are refugees, brought legally to this country to escape persecution in their homelands. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a melting pot, like Boston,&rdquo; Barlow said of Manchester today. &ldquo;Twenty years ago, we were, like, &lsquo;Watch: In 20 years, it&rsquo;ll be just like Boston.&rsquo; Lo and behold, we were right.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Local politicians have often marveled at Manchester&rsquo;s &ldquo;changing face,&rdquo; a phenomenon fueled by two coinciding factors: the steady arrival of immigrants, including a large number of Hispanics, and the resettlement of refugees from around the globe. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the latter group that has spurred debate in recent weeks, as a committee of local politicians and administrators charged with reviewing resettlement practices in the city declared that Manchester has taken in more than its &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; of refugees.</p>
<p>2004 influx </p>
<p>The committee, chaired by city Public Health Director Fred Rusczek, considered the situation in fiscal year 2004, when the city absorbed 364 refugees, according to the report&rsquo;s count. That number, the committee found, exceeded resettlement totals in 23 states, including Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island. </p>
<p>One statistic seemed particularly jarring: Though Manchester accounted for just 8.4 percent of New Hampshire&rsquo;s population in 2004, it hosted close to 80 percent of the state&rsquo;s resettlements. </p>
<p>Rusczek says the influx has jeopardized city services and, by extension, threatened the quality of life for many refugee families. </p>
<p>He plans to present his findings to the Board of Mayor and Aldermen July 11. </p>
<p>Officials with New Hampshire&rsquo;s two resettlement agencies were outraged by the report&rsquo;s characterizations. In particular, they decried the claim that refugees are likely to rely on government assistance for years after arriving in the U.S. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand it. It&rsquo;s really discriminatory against the refugees,&rdquo; said Anne Sanderson, director of the International Institute of New Hampshire, a Manchester-based resettlement agency.</p>
<p>Why Manchester? </p>
<p>At the center of the debate is a dispute over whether Manchester should be taking in the overwhelming majority of New Hampshire&rsquo;s refugees. The state&rsquo;s agencies have not placed any refugees on the Seacoast. New Hampshire&rsquo;s second largest city, Nashua, did not receive any newly arrived refugees until fiscal year 2005, according to statistics kept by the state Office of Energy and Planning. </p>
<p>This was not an oversight, the agencies say. Rather, this is how resettlement agencies have been operating for nearly two decades. Throughout much of the 1990s, in fact, Manchester&rsquo;s share of the state&rsquo;s refugee resettlements was significantly higher than it has been this decade, topping 94 percent in 1992. </p>
<p>The main reason: Manchester&rsquo;s array of urban offerings &mdash; specifically its economy, housing stock and transportation system.  </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A particularly large influx of Somali refugees prompted Manchester officials to enact a three-month moratorium on refugee resettlements in September 2004. Most of those refugees came through LSS. </p>
<p>Since the moratorium&rsquo;s expiration, New Hampshire&rsquo;s two agencies have slowed the Queen City&rsquo;s resettlement rate. Last year, state statistics show, the city took in just more than half of New Hampshire&rsquo;s 312 incoming refugees, a steep drop from the year before. </p>
<p>LSS has shifted its focus to Concord and Laconia, which together are home to almost 90 percent of the agency&rsquo;s 97 cases so far this year. </p>
