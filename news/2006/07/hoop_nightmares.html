						<p>America&rsquo;s Black David Duke has a grandson in Nike&rsquo;s elite basketball camp. But instead of derision, the obsequious sports press is celebrating.</p>
<p>The Nation of Islam&rsquo;s loony leader, Louis Farrakhan, loves lecturing Black America not to become pro athletes or entertainers, but instead to pull themselves up by the bootstraps &hellip; and hate Jews, Asians, Arabs, &ldquo;Crackers,&rdquo; and every other group possible.</p>
<p>(No big deal that he, himself, made his millions not from bootstrap-pulling, but by tax scams, bilking and scamming his followers, and a few unrepaid $5 million &ldquo;loans&rdquo; from fellow loony, Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi.)</p>
<p>Now, there is a Black American and Nation of Islam member who has not taken Calypso Louie&rsquo;s advice: his grandson, Mustapha Farrakhan.</p>
<p>Along with the son of Michael Jordan, Mustapha Farrakhan, a college and NBA hopeful, is attending Nike basketball camp, where he is being eyed by a handful of college scouts.</p>
<p>Since his father, also named Mustapha Farrakhan, is a &ldquo;Supreme Captain&rdquo; of the Nation of Islam, it&rsquo;s a sure bet grandson Mustapha hates Jews and &ldquo;Crackers&rdquo; just like dear old granddaddy.</p>
<p>In an issue of the Nation of Islam&rsquo;s newspaper, &ldquo;The Final Call,&rdquo; Louis Farrakhan says that his son Mustapha (father of the hoops player) supports the establishment of the United States of Africa in place of the America:</p>
<p>    <blockquote>In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.</blockquote></p>
<p>  <blockquote>  I, my son and Supreme Captain, Mustapha Farrakhan, Akbar Muhammad, Sultan Muhammad, and my daughter and nurse, Fatima Farrakhan Muhammad were among those who were blessed to be present at the end of the 38 years of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and, to witness the beginning or the birth of the African Union toward the ultimate United States of Africa&hellip; .</blockquote></p>
<p>    <blockquote>May Allah bless the Leaders of the African Continent. May He bless Brother Muammar Gadhafi that he will not be discouraged in pursuing the idea of the United States of Africa to its ultimate conclusion, and, may Allah bless the sons and daughters of Africa to form a united front wherever we are found to encourage the African Union to ultimately become the United States of Africa.</blockquote></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the gushing press to ask him about those views or whether he agrees with the anti-Semitic, anti-White bigotry of dear old dad. They didn&rsquo;t. The sports press just fawned over his &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; family ties. They&rsquo;d hate to cause an issue for members of the many ethnic groups his grandfather openly derides. There&rsquo;s not New York Times-style &ldquo;public&rsquo;s right to know&rdquo; ethos here.</p>

											<p>
							<i>AP, July 10, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Indianapolis &mdash; When Mustapha Farrakhan showed up at the NBPA Top 100 camp last month, his new buddies all wanted to know whether he was related to the other Farrakhan.</p>
<p>Yes, Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, is his grandfather, but Mustapha is following a different script.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel any pressure because being a Farrakhan, everybody doesn&rsquo;t know us as a basketball family,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The talented 6-foot-3 shooting guard wants to change that perception, and this week&rsquo;s Nike All-America Camp might help. In the first three days, Farrakhan strung together impressive performances in front of a who&rsquo;s who of college coaches and some NBA scouts.</p>
<p>He also blends in with several children of famous sports figures, including Jeffrey Jordan, whose father, Michael, has watched his son every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult not to associate a Farrakhan with top officials in the Nation of Islam, as his father, also named Mustapha, is a supreme captain in the organization. But Farrakhan tries to live like a typical teenager.</p>
<p>He likes sports and music. He attends religious services each Sunday and avoids controversy. His shy, cautious personality doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to making political speeches.</p>
<p>Farrakhan would rather play basketball than talk about it, and the way he&rsquo;s handled himself as the grandson of an international figure has impressed his father.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The questions are only beginning for Farrakhan, though. The soon-to-be senior, who comes from the same high school that produced Redskins receiver Antwaan Randle El, is grilled on how he got involved in basketball and his family&rsquo;s passion for the game. His father missed only one game this season, when he was on an overseas trip. When his grandfather attends, the youngest Farrakhan can always expect to get a little advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes basketball, and he likes to watch me play,&rdquo; Farrakhan said. &ldquo;He tells me to stay in position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the schools that are interested are Wisconsin and Indiana State.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s letting his father handle most of the recruiting issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always taught that a good name is better than silver or gold so anything you do as a service to your community or humanity makes your name stronger,&rdquo; the father said. &ldquo;You try not to do anything that would damage your name&hellip; . But people are human and fallible, so we hope and pray he will be the best he can be.&rdquo;<br>
