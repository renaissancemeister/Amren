<h1><a href="https://seattlepi.nwsource.com/movies/258988_truestory10.html">Hollywood Takes Liberties with True Stories But &lsquo;Glory Road&rsquo; is a Flagrant Foul</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Arnold, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Feb. 10, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a growing irony of today&rsquo;s Hollywood that, the more its filmmakers have come to rely on fact-based stories for their source material, the more inventive they&rsquo;ve tended to become with the facts. These days, when we see that fateful kicker, &ldquo;Based on a true story,&rdquo; experience tells us it&rsquo;s wise to be more than a little suspicious. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent case in point &mdash; and one that strikes close to home &mdash; is the box-office hit, &ldquo;Glory Road,&rdquo; which chronicles the saga of the mostly black Texas Western University 1966 NCAA-champion basketball team, which a title card tells us is &ldquo;based on the true story of the team that changed everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story is basically the impossible dream of coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas), who went against the grain of his white, Southern college to recruit a full squad of black players from around the country and then took them to the top &mdash; a feat the film contends is a major milestone in the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>In the middle of the film, there&rsquo;s a devastating sequence of events that begins when one of the traveling Texas Western Miners is brutally assaulted in the restroom of a Southern restaurant by &ldquo;crackers,&rdquo; beaten bloody and then shoved head-first into a toilet in which we have just seen a man urinating.</p>
<p>Frightened by the incident, their confidence shaken, the Miners shortly thereafter find, in an even more shocking scene, their motel rooms trashed, their personal belongings violated and the slogans &ldquo;Niggers Die&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coons Go Home&rdquo; scrawled all over the walls in what looks like either red paint or blood. </p>
<p>From here, the battered team takes a long, solemn bus ride to Seattle for its next game. When they arrive, the mood is so grim that Haskins&rsquo; assistant wants to give up. But Haskins can&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s become a moral crusade for him. &ldquo;Just THINK of how these boys have been degraded and humiliated just because they&rsquo;re black.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Cut to the Seattle University game, where the fans are booing just like all the rest of the rednecks we have seen. And as a consequence of this abuse &mdash; the restaurant, the motel, the Seattle U fans &mdash; the Miners lose the game: the only loss of their magical season. It&rsquo;s the low point from which they will rise to a thrilling climax. </p>
<p>Now, there are several things wrong with this scenario. First, neither the restaurant nor the motel scenes actually happened to the Texas Miners. This was divulged to me by the film&rsquo;s producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, when I interviewed him a month before the film was released. Those incidents were made up, he said, &ldquo;for dramatic purposes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Second, the racist reaction of the Seattle U fans is a fantasy. When I questioned the scene in my review of the film, a number of readers wrote to confirm my suspicion. &ldquo;I was at the game,&rdquo; one writes. &ldquo;I was 12 years old at the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.   It was a great game but there was no racial booing toward Texas that I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another writes: &ldquo;I am black. I was 16 when I listened to that game on the radio, and I don&rsquo;t remember hearing any racially motivated booing, or any comment on such a response. I&rsquo;m certain it never happened. Seattle-style racism, even 40 years ago, was much too genial and covert to have accommodated such a public display of rudeness.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Still another writes, &ldquo;I was in that crowd and was actually called by the folks making the movie. They wanted to know about the SU fight song (wasn&rsquo;t one), pep band and the like. When I could not provide much in the way of info or salacious details, they rang off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.   If we booed loudly, it was &mdash; as always &mdash; (at) the refs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, the &lsquo;66 Seattle University Chieftains were hardly the lily-white foe the movie depicts. As former player Mike Acres testifies in a recent issue of the Seattle University newspaper (&ldquo;Racism? What Racism&rdquo;), they were &ldquo;a predominately black team. Four of our six top players were black.&rdquo;</p>
