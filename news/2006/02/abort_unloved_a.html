<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AMSTERDAM &mdash; Alderman Marianne van den Anker for the Leefbaar Rotterdam (LR) party has called for a debate in Rotterdam on compulsory abortion and contraception for mothers she believes are responsible for raising unloved babies that fall victim to child abuse.</p>
<p>SWA, a foundation promoting health among Antilleans and Arubans in Rotterdam, said the alderman&rsquo;s comments were degrading. It called on the Mayor Ivo Opstelten and the LR&rsquo;s coalition partners, the Christian Democrat (CDA) and Liberal (VVD) parties, to distance themselves from Van den Anker&rsquo;s views. She has also received dozens of emails criticising her ideas.</p>
<p>As legal experts pointed out, Van den Anker&rsquo;s plan would never be permitted, a CDA spokesperson warned: &ldquo;If Leefbaar Rotterdam raises this idea in the talks to form a new coalition, the CDA will not be part of such an executive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The VVD said women had a right to control their own bodies and the government could not interfere.</p>
<p>Van den Anker is a mother of two children and the official in charge of Rotterdam&rsquo;s health and security portfolios. She is also a candidate in the local elections.</p>
<p>In an interview in newspaper &lsquo;NRC Handelsblad&rsquo; on Saturday, she said she had tried everything to prevent child abuse. &ldquo;I fail, I fail,&rdquo; she told the interviewer as she outlined her controversial idea for a debate on compulsory abortion and contraception.</p>
<p>The three target groups she has in mind are Antillean teenage mothers; drug addicts and people with mental handicaps.</p>
<p>Van den Anker said children from these groups run an &ldquo;unacceptable risk&rdquo; of growing up without love and with &ldquo;violence, neglect, mistreatment and sexual abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The exceptions, are there are some, can be counted on a pair of hands,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The politician told the newspaper the courts would decide on whether abortion was the right option. The decision would be based on experts and care workers who &ldquo;who can see in 95 percent or even 100 percent of cases whether the child has a chance of growing up with love&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Van den Anker supported her argument by suggesting that there were a lot of Antillean youth gangs in Rotterdam whose members come from loveless homes. The gangs, she said, committed rapes, were loverboys (pimps) and guilty of street terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antillean youths who commit serious crimes have been through everything themselves. History repeats itself and they visit the tragedy of their life history on others,&rdquo; she said.</p>
