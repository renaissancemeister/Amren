<h1>Black Spending Habits</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Digital Digest (Detroit), Feb. 8, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>These are tough economic times, especially for African-Americans, for whom the unemployment rate is more than 10%. Alarmingly, rather than belt-tightening, the response has been to spend more. In many poor neighborhoods, one is likely to notice satellite dishes and expensive new cars. </p>
<p>According to Target Market, a company that tracks black consumer spending, blacks spend a significant amount of their income on depreciable products. </p>
<p>In 2002, the year the economy nose-dived; we spent $22.9 billion on clothes, $3.2 billion on electronics and $11.6 billion on furniture to put into homes that, in many cases, were rented. </p>
<p>Among our favorite purchases are cars and liquor. Blacks make up only 12% of the U.S. population, yet account for 30% of the country&rsquo;s Scotch consumption. Detroit, which is 80% black, is the world&rsquo;s No. 1 market for Cognac. </p>
<p>So impressed was Lincoln with the $46.7 billion that blacks spent on cars that the automaker commissioned Sean &ldquo;P Diddy&rdquo; Combs, the entertainment and fashion mogul, to design a limited-edition Navigator replete with six plasma screens, three DVD players and a Sony PlayStation 2. </p>
<p>The only area where blacks seem to be cutting back on spending is books; total purchases have gone from a high of $356 million in 2000 to $303 million in 2002. This shortsighted behavior, motivated by a desire for instant gratification and social acceptance, comes at the expense of our future. The National Urban League&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of Black America 2004&rdquo; report found that fewer than 50% of black families owned their homes compared with more than 70% of whites. </p>
<p>According to published reports, the Ariel Mutual Funds/Charles Schwab 2003 Black Investor Survey found that when comparing households where blacks and whites had roughly the same household incomes, whites saved nearly 20% more each month for retirement, and 30% of African-Americans earning $100,000 a year had less than $5,000 in retirement savings. While 79% of whites invest in the stock market, only 61% of African-Americans do. </p>
<p>Certainly, higher rates of unemployment, income disparity and credit discrimination are financial impediments to the economic vitality of blacks, but so are our consumer tastes.</p>
