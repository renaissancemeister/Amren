<h1>The Second Mexican War</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lawrence Auster, Frontpage Magazine, Feb. 17, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mexican invasion of the United States began decades ago as a spontaneous migration of ordinary Mexicans into the U.S. seeking economic opportunities. It has morphed into a campaign to occupy and gain power over our country&mdash;a project encouraged, abetted, and organized by the Mexican state and supported by the leading elements of Mexican society. </p>
<p>It is, in other words, war. War does not have to consist of armed conflict. War can consist of any hostile course of action undertaken by one country to weaken, harm, and dominate another country. Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico&rsquo;s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. </p>
<p>Cultural imperialism</p>
<p>We experience Mexico&rsquo;s assault on our country incrementally&mdash;as a series of mini-crises, each of which calls forth ever-renewed debates and perhaps some tiny change of policy. Because it has been with us so long and has become part of the cultural and political air we breathe, it is hard for us to see the deep logic behind our &#147;immigration problem.&#148; Focused as we are on border incursions, border enforcement, illegal alien crime, guest worker proposals, changes of government in Mexico City, and other such transient problems and events&mdash;all of them framed by the media&rsquo;s obfuscation of whether or not illegal immigration&rsquo;s costs outweigh its benefits and by the maudlin script of &#147;immigrant rights&#148;&mdash;we don&rsquo;t get the Big Picture: that the Mexican government is promoting and carrying out an attack on the United States. </p>
<p>Another reason we miss what&rsquo;s happening is that our focus is on the immigrants as individuals. Thus our leaders talk about illegal immigrants as &#147;good dads,&#148; &#147;hard working folks&#148; seeking to better their lives and their family&rsquo;s prospects. In fact, this is not about individual immigrants and their families, legal or illegal. It is about a great national migration, a nation of people moving into our nation&rsquo;s land, in order to reproduce on it their own nation and people and push ours aside.</p>
<p>Thus, in orchestrating this war on America, the Mexican state is representing the desires of the Mexican people as a whole. </p>
<p>What are these desires? </p>
<p>(1) Political revanchism&mdash;to regain control of the territories Mexico lost to the U.S. in 1848, thus avenging themselves for the humiliations they feel they have suffered at our hands for the last century and a half; </p>
<p>(2) Cultural imperialism&mdash;to expand the Mexican culture and the Spanish language into North America; and especially</p>
<p>(3) Economic parasitism&mdash;to maintain and increase the flow of billions of dollars that Mexicans in the U.S. send back to their relatives at home every year, a major factor keeping the chronically troubled Mexican economy afloat and the corrupt Mexican political system cocooned in its status quo. </p>
<p>These motives are shared by the Mexican masses and the elites. According to a Zogby </font><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/6/12/141242.shtml"><font size="3" color="#000080">poll</font></a><font size="3"> in 2002, 58 percent of the Mexican people believed the U.S. Southwest belongs to Mexico, and 57 percent believed that Mexicans have the right to enter the United States without U.S. permission. Only small minorities disagreed with these propositions. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, for Mexico&rsquo;s opinion shapers, it is simply a truism that the great northern migration is a reconquista of lands belonging to Mexico, the righting of a great historic wrong. &#147;A peaceful mass of people &hellip; carries out slowly and patiently an unstoppable invasion, the most important in human history&#148; [emphasis added], wrote columnist Carlos Loret de Mola for Mexico City&rsquo;s Excelsior newspaper in 1982. </p>
<p>You cannot give me a similar example of such a large migratory wave by an ant-like multitude, stubborn, unarmed, and carried on in the face of the most powerful and best-armed nation on earth &hellip; . [The migrant invasion] seems to be slowly returning [the southwestern United States] to the jurisdiction of Mexico without the firing of a single shot, nor requiring the least diplomatic action, by means of a steady, spontaneous, and uninterrupted occupation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska told the Venezuelan journal El Imparcial on July 3rd, 2001: </p>
<p>The people of the poor, the lice-ridden and the cucarachas are advancing in the United States, a country that wants to speak Spanish because 33.4 million Hispanics impose their culture &hellip; Mexico is recovering the territories ceded to the United States with migratory tactics &hellip; [This phenomenon] fills me with jubilation, because the Hispanics can have a growing force between Patagonia and Alaska.</p>
<p>The Mexicans, as Poniatowska sees it, have changed from resentful losers&mdash;which was the way Octavio Paz saw them in his famous 1960 study, The Labyrinth of Solitude&mdash;into winners. What accounts for this change? Their expansion northward into the U.S., as the vanguard of a Hispanic conquest of all of North America&mdash;cultural imperialism and national vengeance combined in one great volkish movement. </p>
<p>Politicians echo the same aggressive sentiments. At an International Congress of the Spanish Language in Spain in October 2000, Vicente Fox, soon to become president of Mexico with the support of U.S. conservatives, </font><font size="3" color="#000080">spoke</font><font size="3"> of the &#147;millions of Mexicans in the United States, who in cities such as Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Miami or San Francisco, inject the vitality of the Spanish language and of their cultural expression &hellip; . To continue speaking Spanish in the United States is to hacer patria&#148;&mdash;to do one&rsquo;s patriotic duty. Fox was thus describing Mexican immigrants in the U.S., not as people who had left Mexico and still had some sentimental connections there, as all immigrants do, but as carriers of the national mission of the Mexican nation into and inside the United States. </p>
<p>At the same conference, the Mexican novelist </font><font size="3" color="#000080">Carlos Fuentes</font><font size="3"> said: &#147;In the face of the silent reconquista of the United States [emphasis added], we confront a new linguistic phenomenon,&#148; by which he meant that Spanish was conquering English just as it conquered the Aztec language centuries ago. According to El Siglo, Fuentes received &#147;an intense ovation.&#148; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s five-year development plan in 1995 announced that the &#147;Mexican nation extends beyond  &hellip;  its border&#148;&mdash;into the United States. Accordingly, the government would &#147;strengthen solidarity programs with the Mexican communities abroad by emphasizing their Mexican roots, and supporting literacy programs in Spanish and the teaching of the history, values, and traditions of our country.&#148;</p>
<p>Such solidarity not only keeps Mexican-Americans sending remittances back to the home country, it makes them willing instruments of the Mexican government. Fox&rsquo;s national security adviser </font><a href="https://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3b43515e550e.htm"><font size="3" color="#000080">proposed</font></a><font size="3"> the mobilization of Mexican-Americans as a tool of Mexican foreign policy, as </font><a href="https://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3b43515e550e.htm"><font size="3" color="#000080">reported</font></a><font size="3"> by Allan Wall. The head of the Presidential Office for Mexicans Abroad said: &#147;We are betting that the Mexican American population in the United States  &hellip;  will think Mexico first.&#148; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Employing this irredentist logic, President Fox refuses to call undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. &#147;illegals.&#148; He told radio host Sean Hannity in March 2002: &#147;They are not illegals. They are people that come there to work, to look for a better opportunity.&#148; But if people who have entered the U.S. illegally are not doing something illegal, then U.S. law itself has no legitimacy, at least over Mexican-Americans, and any operation of U.S. law upon them is aggression against the Mexican people. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Let us now consider some of the specific actions by which the Mexican government is carrying out the strategy outlined above:</p>
<p>- The Mexican government publishes a comic book-style booklet, Gu&iacute;a del Migrante Mexicano (Guide for the Mexican Migrant), on how to transgress the U.S. border safely (&#147;Crossing the river can be very risky, especially if you cross alone and at night  &hellip;  Heavy clothing grows heavier when wet and this makes it difficult to swim or float&#148;) and avoid detection once in the U.S. </p>
<p>- As Heather Mac Donald puts it, Mexico backs up these written instructions with real-world resources for the collective assault on the border. An elite law enforcement team called Grupo Beta protects illegal migrants as they sneak into the U.S. from corrupt Mexican officials and criminals&mdash;essentially pitting two types of Mexican lawlessness against each other. Grupo Beta currently maintains aid stations for Mexicans crossing the desert. In April 2005, it worked with Mexican federal and Sonoran state police to help steer illegal aliens away from Arizona border spots patrolled by Minutemen border enforcement volunteers&mdash;demagogically denounced by President Vicente Fox as &#147;migrant-hunting groups.&#148;</p>
<p>- While the Mexican government sends police to protect illegal border crossers against criminals, rogue Mexican soldiers protecting drug smugglers have threatened U.S. Border Patrol agents, and even engaged in shootouts, as </font><a href="https://www.washtimes.com/national/20060119-123013-9068r.htm"><font size="3" color="#000080">reported</font></a><font size="3"> in the Washington Times in January 2006. Rep. Tom Tancredo says the activities of these renegade Mexican troops in support of drug traffickers </font><font size="3" color="#000080">amount to a &#147;war&#148;</font><font size="3"> along the U.S.-Mexico border, and he has urged President Bush to deploy troops there. </p>
<p>- Meanwhile, sheriffs from Hudspeth County, Texas testified before the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Investigations this month at a hearing titled &#147;Armed and Dangerous: Confronting the Problem of Border Incursions.&#148; They spoke of a dramatic increase in alien and drug smuggling. &#147;The U.S./Mexico border is the weakest link and our national security is only as good as our weakest link,&#148; said one sheriff. &#147;Our border <em>is</em> under siege.&#148; We need to understand that whether the Mexican government is behind the border incursions or is merely unable (or unwilling) to stop them, it ultimately doesn&rsquo;t matter. As I said at the beginning, the Mexican war on America is supported by all segments of the Mexican society, even, apparently, the criminals. The situation is thus analogous to Muslim razzias or raids&mdash;irregular attacks short of outright invasion&mdash;used to soften a target country in anticipation of full scale military conquest. The outlaws and smugglers and the renegade soldiers may not be official agents of the Mexican government, yet they are serving its purposes by sowing mayhem along our southern border and demoralizing our population. </p>
