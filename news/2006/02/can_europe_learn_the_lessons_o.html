						          <p><font size="3">The 
            drama of the former Yugoslavia is a text-book example of how multiculturalism 
            leads to chaos. If three quite similar East European peoples went 
            murderously to war against each other, one can imagine what will happen 
            when intercommunal wars in multiracial cities of Western Europe gather 
            steam. To anyone not completely blinded by &quot;anti-racist&quot; 
            propaganda, what has happened in Yugoslavia casts a very dubious light 
            on the viability of multiracialism. </font></font></p>
                    <p><font size="3">Events are forcing themselves into 
            public notice, and the first cracks in the belief in multiethnic conviviality 
            are beginning to appear. For years, local turf wars between young 
            Germans and Turkish gangs were seldom reported by the German media. 
            Now even journalists in the ultra-liberal <i>Der Spiegel </i>can no 
            longer avoid reporting on the &quot;ticking ethnic time bombs&quot; 
            in the suburbs of European capitals. Street battles between native 
            Britons and East Asians that leave scores of injured can no longer 
            be hidden or underreported. News about muggings of whites in Brussels, 
            and beatings of elderly Parisians have crept into the local papers, 
            though they are still on the sixth or seventh page.</font></p>

 <p><font size="3">The racial profile of Europe has changed 
            dramatically over the last 30 years. A visit to any large town in 
            Western Europe will turn up staggering numbers of uneducated non-whites, 
            mostly Muslims. Just as in the United States, any criticism of these 
            newcomers is branded as &quot;racism&quot; or &quot;fascism,&quot; 
            but in private, there is much resentment of Third-World immigration.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">What brought about this influx? Germany, 
            which has been the economic locomotive of Europe, still suffers from 
            an almost pathological national masochism and the hovering stigma 
            of inborn fascism. This is behind the pathetic German wish to buy 
            forgiveness through &quot;checkbook diplomacy,&quot; financial handouts 
            to immigrants, and open arms to the downtrodden of the world. The 
            Catholic Church also peddles Hollywood-style sentimentalism about 
            immigrants and multicolored brotherhood.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">When racial turf wars break out &mdash; whether 
            in Berlin, Marseille, or Oldham &mdash; the liberal media and ruling elites 
            still focus on unpleasant consequences rather than on causes. They 
            persist in that incoherent but fashionable panacea: The remedy for 
            xenophobia and multiracial friction is to let in yet more non-Europeans 
            rather than expel the ones who are already here. Since the arrival 
            of relatively small numbers of non-whites causes friction and tension, 
            the solution is to bring in millions more!</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">As in the United States, there is 
            a growing tendency among European whites towards sullen political 
            apathy and flight from non-whites, punctuated by sudden outbursts 
            of hostility towards foreigners. That supra state, the European Union 
            (EU), is a volcano waiting to explode.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Russia and Eastern Europe have been 
            largely spared the immigration onslaught, and are now the last major 
            white enclaves on the planet. According to statistics on the number 
            of Third-World residents in Western Europe compiled in 1995 by the 
            Catholic relief association &quot;Caritas,&quot; Western Europe has 
            over 19 million foreign immigrants while Eastern Europe has practically 
            none.</font></p>

          <p><font size="3">At the same time, in one of the great 
            ironies of our time, East and West have swapped places in terms of 
            freedom of inquiry. During the Communist terror it was forbidden to 
            question Marxist dogma. Today, it is in Western Europe that criticism 
            of racial or historical dogma can end the career of a scholar or politician, 
            and even send him to prison. By contrast, in the bookshops of Moscow, 
            Budapest or Zagreb one can find plenty of books about race or historical 
            revisionism. It is not to be ruled out that Eastern Europe will become 
            the safe haven for Western dissidents, just as the West was once a 
            haven for dissidents from the East.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">What is more, despite the horrible 
            legacy of communism and continuing poverty, it may be in Eastern Europe 
            that we will eventually find political transparency and efficient 
            democracy. For democracy to work, losers in elections must be willing 
            to bow out gracefully. They do this only if they believe the winners 
            share the same fundamental understanding of national goals. In multiethnic 
            societies, where political parties form along ethnic lines, and every 
            ballot is a racial head-count, elections are not just political choices; 
            they become expressions of national identity. With stakes this high, 
            democracy collapses, just as it did in the former Yugoslavia.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Likewise, now that Czechoslovakia, 
            Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union have broken apart, most citizens 
            of Eastern European nations speak the same language. As Steve Sailer 
            of the Human Biodiversity Institute points out, people can monitor 
            their government&rsquo;s performance effectively only when everyone has 
            a common tongue. &quot;In a multilingual polity with an activist state 
            such as the EU,&quot; he writes, &quot;it becomes impractical to follow 
            what is going on. Thus power flows to a multilingual elite.&quot; 
            This observation has relevance for the United States, too, as its 
            Spanish-speaking minority begins to reach critical mass.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">The multiethnic fray in Yugoslavia 
            and the potential for similar eruptions in Europe are in perfect accord 
            with what people like Noble prize-winner Konrad Lorenz and Robert 
            Ardrey have taught us about human nature. Likewise, the well-known 
            German scholar and ethologist Irenaus Eibel-Eibesfeldt points out 
            that one can learn to respect the Other, only when the Other lives 
            on his separate turf, or under his own jurisdiction. The closer one 
            is to the Other, the greater the risk of conflict. Prof. Eibel-Eibesfeldt 
            writes that fear and hostility are common reactions to the &quot;foreigner&quot; 
            in all races and cultures. Human beings form close-knit communities 
            that exclude foreigners. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Assimilation and integration of the 
            foreigner is possible if he looks like a native, but it becomes difficult 
            if he does not. As Prof. Eibel-Eibesfeldt concludes, &quot;with side-by-side 
            living of mixed ethnicities, the prognoses for the maintenance of 
            harmony look bleak. Each ethnic group feels itself under threat by 
            the other ethnic group. The majority ethnic group fears being overwhelmed 
            by the foreign ethnic group, and the minority ethnic group fears the 
            domination of the majority. History teaches that in such an environment, 
            conflicts are bound to occur sooner or later.&quot; (<i>Krieg und 
            Frieden: Aus der Sicht der Verhaltungsforschung</i>, [<i>War and Peace: 
            From the Perspective of Ethology</i>, published 1984 by Piper Verlag, 
            expanded version, 1997]).</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">People who differ from each other 
            appreciate each other best when they live apart. When they are forced 
            together into an unnatural union, intercommunal violence is bound 
            to erupt into a never-ending spiral of incrimination and hatred. The 
            proponents of multiculturalism refuse to understand this, and continue 
            to trumpet their belief in utopia, particularly to brain-washed young 
            whites.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">It has now been abundantly proven 
            that multiracialism is academic nonsense and works nowhere in the 
            world. The safest, healthiest, and most prosperous countries are those 
            that enforce strict immigration laws, and whose citizens are homogeneous 
            and proud of their roots. Scarcely-populated Iceland and densely-populated 
            Japan are good examples of viable states.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Multiracialism under different names 
            and slogans and in different legal forms has for decades provided 
            the intellectual fodder for leftist intellectuals forced to abandon 
            Communism. It is intolerable for them that the multicultural experiment 
            in Yugoslavia failed, and Western countries have spent billions of 
            dollars trying to force Balkan peoples that hate each other to live 
            together. Now that the multiethnic states &mdash; Czechoslovakia, Soviet Union, 
            Yugoslavia &mdash; are gone, left-leaning EU officials have doctored up a 
            new multiethnic role model, the European Union itself.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">The small yet growing number of nationalist, 
            anti-multicultural young people all over Eastern and Western Europe 
            may yet put an end to this dangerous fantasy. At the same time, unlike 
            in the United States, there are influential political parties like 
            the National Front in France, the Freedom Party in Austria, and the 
            Vlaams Blok in Belgium, whose leaders fully understand that the future 
            of Europe lies in the balance. Whatever one may think of the merits 
            of pan-Europeanism, there might have been some hope for a union that 
            was racially and culturally European. Now, with more than 15 million 
            immigrants in its midst, it is questionable whether the European Union 
            can even call itself European. How to come to terms with its own inefficient 
            and terrified bureaucracy, and how to weather the storms of its own 
            impending racial balkanization? These are the questions on everybody&rsquo;s 
            mind &mdash; and on no government agenda.</font></p>
