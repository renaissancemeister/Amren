<div align="left"><i>Vikas Bajaj and Ron Nixon, New York Times, Feb. 22, 2006</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>CLEVELAND &mdash; Catrina V. Roberts, a single mother of four, joined a new, growing class of minority homeowners when she moved from her subsidized apartment to a two-story house in 1999.</p>
<p>But Ms. Roberts fell behind on her payments and declared bankruptcy last year. Now, as she loses her modest home to foreclosure, Ms. Roberts may represent the vanguard of a worrying trend of retreat.</p>
<p>The housing boom of the last decade helped push minority home ownership rates above 50 percent for the first time in 2004 and the overall foreclosure rate below 1 percent. Social scientists laud these accomplishments because ownership can foster greater neighborhood stability and economic progress. President Bush cites rising minority ownership as a milestone achievement under his &ldquo;ownership society&rdquo; programs.</p>
<p>But hidden behind such success stories lies a disturbing trend: in the last several years, neighborhoods with large poor and minority populations in places like Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia and Atlanta have experienced a sharp rise in foreclosures, in some cases more than a doubling, according to an analysis of court filings and other housing data by The New York Times and academic researchers. </p>
<p>The black home ownership rate even dipped slightly last year, according to the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>The increase in foreclosures could be the first of a wave of financial distress for many minority homeowners, experts say, because they are twice as likely as whites to have taken out expensive subprime mortgages, most of which will jump to higher interest rates in the next two years, according to an analysis of data that lenders disclose under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. </p>
<p>Subprime loans, which are made to borrowers with credit histories that the industry considers less than prime, have interest rates that are, on average, three points higher than the prime rate, about 6.2 percent now, and they carry higher fees and prepayment penalties that make it expensive to refinance. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The example of Ms. Roberts is noteworthy because her loan was not considered subprime. It came from KeyBank, a longstanding Cleveland institution, and carried a relatively low fixed interest rate of 7.4 percent on a principal of $65,000. She never had a credit card, much less a credit record, and put down only $2,000.</p>
<p>Over the years, Ms. Roberts&rsquo;s monthly expenses rose because of repairs to a dilapidated porch and the birth of two grandchildren, but the $880 a month she takes home after taxes from her job as a home health aide did not. </p>
<p>Ms. Roberts, 35, also receives $1,100 in Social Security benefits because two of her younger children have learning disabilities. &ldquo;I know when you buy a house, eventually you have to put work into it,&rdquo; she said and sighed, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know it would lead me here, because if I did I would have never bought it. So, I am at a point right now that I don&rsquo;t want to ever buy a house, ever again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is no way to know how many foreclosures of minority-owned homes have occurred in the Cleveland area, because county filings do not identify people by race. Experts say the closest proxy is the number of auctions of seized homes conducted by a sheriff as a ratio of conventional sales in areas with large minority populations. </p>
<p>In the eastern part of the county, which is 52 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic, the ratio of auctions to regular sales was 23 per 100 last year, up from 9 in 1995. In the west, which is 82 percent white, the ratio was 11 per 100, up from 2.5. </p>
<p>A similar pattern can be seen in Chicago, where foreclosure filings tripled, to 7,576, from 1993 to 2005. Neighborhoods where the population is more than 80 percent non-white account for 65 percent of all cases, up from 61 percent in 1993, according to data compiled by the National Training and Information Center, a housing advocacy and research group based in Chicago. The same trends have been documented in Atlanta and Philadelphia, according to researchers from Harvard and the Reinvestment Fund, a Philadelphia-based investment organization hired by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking to study mortgage foreclosures in the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Loan data that mortgage lenders must disclose show that minorities are far more likely to receive subprime loans than whites. About 30 percent of home purchase loans made to blacks from 1999 to 2004 and 20 percent of home loans made to Hispanics were subprime, compared with 10.4 percent of loans to Asian-Americans, only slightly higher than for white borrowers.</p>
<p>In 2004, the latest year with data available, nearly 27 percent of loans taken out by minorities were subprime, up from 15 percent in 1999.</p>
<p>The disparities persist even when income is taken into account. Among minority borrowers who made $51,000 to $75,000 a year, 23 percent received subprime loans. By comparison, only 10 percent of whites in the same income bracket did. Minorities who made $151,000 to $175,000 were twice as likely to get a subprime loan as whites were.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>What the article didn&rsquo;t go into was the effect of all the &ldquo;programs&rdquo; that were designed to help prospective minority homeowners get into a home.  Much like the college entrance quotas, they had a hand in getting in, but once in, they were unable to keep up and make the grade. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the experimental results are conclusive.  It turns out it&rsquo;s better to let people earn their own way &ldquo;in&rdquo;, whether it be home ownership or college matriculation.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>This isn&rsquo;t news. It would be news if it was the other way around. All lucid people can figure that out. Nobody has to see all sorts of numbers varifying something like this. For the most part, minorities aren&rsquo;t prepared to live independently. So why would anybody think that they could purchase and maintain a house? Certainly black people have no real idea of &#8220;interest.&#8221;<br>
They seem to be only able to deal with the idea of here and now. Any concept of sometime in the future is too vague for them to deal with.</p>
<p>The proof of what I say is in the article itself.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Although most non-whites would say that this is just another way of &#8216;keeping a brother down&rsquo; it is not.   Banks do not want to take their house.  Even if very little is owed on a house that is worth a lot (not that that&rsquo;s common) it is more hassle to forclose than it&rsquo;s worth. The bank makes far more on the interest than ever made by forclosure . All the bank wants are homebuyers to keep the agreement made at the time of the loan.</p>
<p> Also, most of the houses involved in forclosure are in need of extensive repair of damages caused by disgruntled evictees.<br>
 <br><br>
The banks are trying to help people live the American dream, and lose money with every foreclosure.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Catrina has four children (probably illegitimate). She presently has no husband, and probably never did. She has also become a  grandmother at age 30. To support herself, she taught two of her children to act &#8220;Funny&#8221; in front of the Social Security Case worker (Guess the color) who found that her &#8220;disabled&#8221; children were entitled to $1,100 per month from the white taxpayers, until these parasites reach eighteen years of age. These payments are known as &#8220;Crazy Checks&#8221; among the blacks committing <span class="caps">SSI </span>fraud. <br>
Once her children become as obese as their mother, at eighteen years of age, they can go back to same caseworker and claim to be disabled by high blood pressure and maybe Post Traumatic Slavery Syndrome and continue on disability until they &#8220;retire&#8221; on regular SS at age 62.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>Don&rsquo;t forget - it&rsquo;s tax time.  I&rsquo;m sure Catrina was the first in line at <span class="caps">H&R</span> Block or Liberty Tax, with her paycheck stub in hand, to claim all four children and receive an enormous <span class="caps">EIC </span>credit for $4,000 or $5,000.  And she still couldn&rsquo;t make her mortgage payment on a $65,000 home.  Her payment must have been all of $400.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know about the <span class="caps">EIC </span>credit, Google it.  It&rsquo;s one of the biggest liberal scams in America, perpetrated against all hard working taxpayers, disguised as tax code.  It&rsquo;s a refundable credit tied to the amount of income a person earns at a job or through self-employment.  If you are single with no kids, and earned $11,000, your credit would be $55.  If you are single, with two or more illegit children and earned $11,000, you get a whopping $4,400. </p>
<p>I see it every day as a tax preparer.  Your tax money is being dished out all over the country to single mothers who have no talent other than lying on their backs.  What&rsquo;s really disgusting is how these idiots feel the money is owed to them after they have gotten the credit for a couple of years.  </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Most blacks have horrible credit, which is why they get subprime loans.  Even high-income blacks tend to spend every penny they earn, and pay bills late or not at all.  </p>
<p>If you adjust for credit scores, there is absolutely NO rate discrimination against blacks in mortgage lending.  The federal government audits banks and lenders through <span class="caps">HMDA </span>reporting, which is designed to uncover racist lending.  It <span class="caps">DOES </span>take into account credit score differences, however, and that&rsquo;s why subprime lenders haven&rsquo;t been sued and shut-down for racism - because blacks are getting mortgage rates they deserve based on their credit history.  </p>
<p>It would not be hard for this reporter to include a paragraph describing <span class="caps">HMDA </span>reporting and average credit score differences by race.  But, that would completely defeat the whiney PC reporting.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of being lied to by the media - they know we&rsquo;re not so stupid as to believe this crap!  <span class="caps">EVERYONE, </span>including liberals, noticed the &#8220;single mother with 4 kids&#8221;, &#8220;subsidized apartment&#8221;, 35-yr old grandmother, etc in this article.  We all know <span class="caps">EXACTLY </span>what really happened here.  </p>
<p>And why are we paying $1,100/mo for &#8220;learning disabled&#8221; children?  How do their &#8220;learning disabilities&#8221; factor into lost income? Is she supposed to be getting them $1,100 in tutoring every month?  Can we see receipts from the tutors??  <br>

  <font size="3"><p>Wow! Too bad for Ms. Roberts. Maybe there is room at the trailer park next to all of the alcoholic, beer drinking, missing teeth and bare foot white folks I see? She should move to California! The brown folks, particularly the Mexicans, are buying up everything in sight. I own one home, 3 bedroom 2 bath, and will close escrow on a triplex (Northern California) by month&rsquo;s end. All with the help of lending institutions that only see green! By 2020 most white California&rsquo;s will be gone to places like Idaho, Nevada or some other desolate place. Good riddance!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I learned about the enormity of the <span class="caps">EIC </span>credit about this time last year when I was passing through a small, heavily black town here in the South at about 7PM.  There was a line streaching all the way around the courthouse square that utimately lead to a small storefront tax preparation business, through the window of which I saw two middle aged white women with big hair working real hard it seemed(retrospectively, in my mind&rsquo;s eye this scene is still perversely amusing).  I also remember seeing a liquor store on the edge of town that was doing a booming business.</p>
<p>A week or so later I overheard someone explaining the ins and outs of the <span class="caps">EIC. </span> I also remembered that that particular day I passed through the town was the first day that one could file income taxes, and it all came together for me at that moment.  I would venture to say that due to <span class="caps">EIC MLK </span>day has taken a secondary role in the pantheon of black holidays.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I am suprised that there isn&rsquo;t a program to pay her mortage until she gets back on her feet (30 years). If the public knew about all the stupid programs that pay down payments, fees and the whole nine yards they would be pissed at what they subsidize.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles there is program that was giving people 70,000 dollars for the down payment in the form of a no payback second. The feds gave this person 10,000 with no recovery. At least the second got paid back if the house appreciated. However, the city took all the risk with no payback except the principal. The banks, of course, loved the program.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>I wonder how much of those &#8220;learning disabilities&#8221; are simply related to low IQs. I didn&rsquo;t know that simply being stupid was a reason for entitlement. <br>

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;Learning Disabled&#8221; is a polite way of saying &#8220;Retarded&#8221;.</p>
<p>To qualify as Mentally Retarded, an indivudual must:</p>
<p>1. Have an <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>lower than 70.</p>
<p>2. Have low &#8220;adaptive behaviors&#8221; (be poor at things like telling time, counting money, dressing, controlling aggression, etc.)</p>
<p>4. Whatever caused these problems had to have occured before the person reached 18 years of age.</p>
<p>Most often the cause happens in the womb.  Any brain trauma such as poisoning, injury, overheating, or oxygen deprivation can cause it.</p>
<p>The tests for determination are made by a psychologist.  The legal reclassification as MR is made by a judge.  It&rsquo;s a legal status like being a citizen or a minor. </p>
<p>Government checks for Mental Retardation don&rsquo;t stop at age 18.  They continue from discovery of the condition until the day the person is laid to rest.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Reply: Most people as a whole have bad credit now days black and white, losing their jobs ect.and the cost of living has increased and wages have not reflected this. As for as Even high-income blacks tend to spend every penny they earn, and pay bills late or not at all, I would to see how you came up with that information.</p>
<p>Quote: Blacks finding that eyes on the &ldquo;prize&rdquo; is a lot easier when they collected welfare.</p>
<p>Reply: I&rsquo;m sure this holds true to other races as well.</p>
<p>Quote:  Where is the surprise here? I have been in the real estate management business for almost 20 years. I can count on the remaining fingers of a sawmillers hands the number of blacks that had good credit when applying for housing.</p>
<p>Reply: I would be curious to know where your housing is located. I don&rsquo;t think anyone Black or White would give a person with you attitude 5 seconds of time to abtain that much info about their credit.</p>
<p><br>
I think there is a little too much stereo typing going on in theses comments. First, I would like to state that I am Black and I have good score sand I do not have a sub-prime loan . My Neighbors are black as well and none of them have sub-prime loans. I have money in the bank, not a lot but somewhere around $45K at the moment. Most of the black people I know have money in savings as well.</p>
<p>Now with that being said, you can substitute every word &ldquo;Black&rdquo; in your negative comments with the word &ldquo;White&rdquo; and you will find situations where everything stated is applicable to a group of whites as well. Yes &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; do have bad credit; Yes &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; do get evicted, Yes &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; too DO <span class="caps">NOT </span>save, and lastly, yes there are &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; on welfare and more of them than Blacks as well. But you will not see that fact in your editorials nor do I see you discussing that here.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, being a particular color does not make you &ldquo;Good&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bad&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the person and the life style they have chosen to follow. By reading most of your comments here it is fair to say that a majority of you are confused and are receiving your information from bigots. Most of you here need to seek God and pray&hellip;<br>

<p>Charges of &#8220;bigotry&#8221; do not work around here, as we are intellectual adults. A statement is either true or false; those are the only qualities that pertain to it.

<p>Sly Dog,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been underwriting home equity and mortgage loans for over 6 years, and I&rsquo;ve reviewed <span class="caps">THOUSANDS </span>of credit reports from people of all races, and all income levels.  </p>
<p>There are 3 places I got that information:</p>
<p>1) My considerable experience - see above.  Yes, lots of whites have bad credit, but in <span class="caps">NOWHERE </span>near the percentage of black people.  </p>
<p>2) Various reputable studies that can be easily found on the internet - look it up!</p>
<p>3)  Black activists who site alledged &#8220;credit discrimination&#8221; that supposedly causes black people to have lower average credit scores.  The activits do not doubt the typical credit score difference.  Look it up.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Here is the same phenomenon from another perspective (not mine, though). </p>
<p>If the &#8220;underprivileged minorities&#8221; borrow much more that they are able to repay and, as a result, their property is repossessed, then that&rsquo;s blatant racism and discrimination. They should be given a monetary instrument that would allow them to borrow as much as they need without having to pay anything back. After all, they (particularly, Mexican mestizos) are entitled to the benefits of past slavery and similar discriminatory paractices.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>Sly Dog, there are a lot more whites in this country than blacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that whites on welfare outnumber blacks in absolute numbers. What matters is the percentage of each group on welfare.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>&#8220;yes there are &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; on welfare and more of them than Blacks as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>A large percentage are white women and their mulatto bastard children. These births are also counted as part of the &#8220;white&#8221; birthrate.<br>
