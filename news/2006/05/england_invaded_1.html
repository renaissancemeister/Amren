            <p><font size="3">White 
              Americans live under something akin to an alien occupation of the 
              mind. Our churches, politicians, journalists, and professors all 
              promote a view of the world that is as damaging to us as would be 
              an ideology imposed by a conquering power. Of course, there has 
              been no military conquest of the United States, and therefore no 
              specific event to which we can point as the origin of this campaign 
              against us. For this reason, only a minority of whites recognize 
              that we are under enemy occupation&mdash;intellectually speaking&mdash;and 
              many whites are unwitting collaborators in a system that could prove 
              fatal to their civilization.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">But what of those who recognize 
              the dimensions of the crisis and have the choice of acquiescence 
              or resistance? When the opposition is in firm control, the rewards 
              of collaboration attract the cowards, conformists, and the unprincipled. 
              Those who are loyal to the memory of older and better ways must 
              be ready to sacrifice&mdash;but which sacrifices are meaningful, 
              and how powerful is the temptation to collaborate?</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">It is these questions that the British 
              author Saki&mdash;whose real name was Hector Hugh Munro&mdash;explores 
              in his satirical 1913 novel, <i>When William Came</i>. In this case, 
              Britain does not suffer intellectual occupation by the forces of 
              &#147;anti-racist&#148; liberalism but military occupation by the 
              German Kaiser&rsquo;s armies. The British are defeated in a lightening 
              campaign in which their navy is destroyed, and the United Kingdom 
              is incorporated as a German province. The Royal Family escapes to 
              India, where a band of loyalist exiles maintains symbolic resistance 
              in the colonies. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Most of the novel describes how 
              members of the leisure class of London accommodate themselves psychologically 
              to a firm but civilized occupation. Just as American whites today 
              are reminded daily of the intellectual occupation under which they 
              live, the British must accustom themselves to new currency and postage 
              stamps, bilingual signs, taxes to pay for the administration, strange 
              uniforms, and an alien flag flying over Buckingham Palace. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The hero, Murrey Yeovil, was traveling 
              overseas at the time of the defeat, and when he returns home after 
              a long absence finds he no longer lives at 28 Berkshire Street but 
              <i>Berkshcirestrasse acht-und-zwanzig.</i> He also finds that his 
              wife Cicely has cheerfully accommodated herself to what is known 
              as the <i>fait accompli</i>. He suggests they emigrate and join 
              the resistance in the colonies.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;It&rsquo;s a difficult question,&#148; 
              said Cicely, &#147;whether one should stay at home and face the 
              music or go away and live a transplanted life under the British 
              flag. Either attitude might be dictated by patriotism.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;It is one thing to face the 
              music, it is another thing to dance to it,&#148; said Yeovil. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;Really, Murrey,&#148; she 
              adds later, &#147;if you will think things over a bit, you will 
              see that the course I am following is the one dictated by sane patriotism.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;Whom the gods wish to render 
              harmless they first afflict with sanity,&#148; says Yeovil bitterly.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Yeovil is appalled that his wife&rsquo;s 
              gay social life goes on despite the occupation&mdash;&#147;rather 
              like merry-making with a dead body lying in the house,&#148; as 
              he puts it&mdash;but is reminded of a passage from a book about Bulgarian 
              social life under Turkish rule:</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;Bondage has this one advantage: 
              it makes a nation merry. Where far-reaching ambition has no scope 
              for its development the community squanders its energy on the trivial 
              and personal cares of its daily life, and seeks relief and recreation 
              in simple and easily obtained material enjoyment.&#148;</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">Saki continues: &#147;The thought 
              of that determined little nation [Bulgaria] came to him with a sharp 
              sense of irony. There was a people who had not thought it beneath 
              the dignity of their manhood to learn the trade and discipline of 
              arms. They had their reward: torn and exhausted and debt-encumbered 
              from their campaigns, they were masters in their own house, the 
              Bulgarian flag flew over the Bulgarian mountains.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Mastery, when it comes, is worth 
              any sacrifice.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Yeovil roams London, trying to understand 
              what has happened, estimating the chances of throwing off the occupation. 
              He strikes up a conversation with a young clergyman who &#147;had 
              a keen, clever, hard-lined face, the face of a man who, in an earlier 
              stage of European history might have been a warlike prior, awkward 
              to tackle at the council-board, greatly to be avoided where blows 
              were being exchanged.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Yeovil asks how the lower classes, 
              among whom the cleric works, are taking the defeat. The answer could 
              as well pass for how ordinary Americans feel today about their own 
              occupation: &#147;They take it badly,&#148; said the young man, 
              &#147;badly, in more senses than one. They are helpless and they 
              are bitter&mdash;bitter in the useless kind of way that produces 
              no great resolutions.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The cleric is not prepared to take 
              things lying down: &#147;I have learned one thing in life,&#148; 
              he continues, &#147;and that is that peace is not for this world. 
              Peace is what God gives us when He takes us into His rest. Beat 
              your sword into a ploughshare if you like, but beat your enemy into 
              smithereens first.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Yeovil meets a Hungarian, who argues 
              that the British were beaten because wealth and luxury had made 
              them soft, and because they had lost their island-bred suspicions: 
              &#147;For the old insular belief that all foreigners were devils 
              and rogues they substituted another belief, equally grounded on 
              insular lack of knowledge, that most foreigners were amiable, good 
              fellows, who only needed to be talked to and patted on the back 
              to become your friends and benefactors.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;We in Hungary,&#148; he explains, 
              &#147;live too much cheek by jowl with our racial neighbours to 
              have many illusions about them. Austrians, Roumanians, Serbs, Italians, 
              Czechs, we know what to think of them, we know what we want in the 
              world, and we know what they want; that knowledge does not send 
              us flying at each other&rsquo;s throats, but it does keep us from 
              growing soft. Ah, the British lion was in a hurry to inaugurate 
              the Millennium and to lie down gracefully with the lamb. He made 
              two mistakes, only two, but they were very bad ones; the Millennium 
              hadn&rsquo;t arrived, and it was not a lamb that he was lying down 
              with.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The fieriest character in the novel 
              is an old aristocratic woman Yeovil consults about what he should 
              do:</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;Are you going to be a fighter, 
              or the very humble servant of the <i>fait accompli?</i>&#148; she 
              asks.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;I shall never be the servant 
              of the <i>fait accompli</i>,&#148; said Yeovil. &#147;I loathe it. 
              As to fighting, one must first find out what weapon to use, and 
              how to use it effectively. One must watch and wait.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The old woman astonishes Yeovil 
              by telling him that if she were a young man like him she would become 
              a traveling salesman:</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;Yes, one whose business took 
              him up and down the country, into contact with all classes, into 
              homes and shops and inns and railway carriages. And as I travelled 
              I would work, work on the minds of every boy and girl I came across, 
              every young father and young mother too, every young couple that 
              were going to be man and wife. I would awaken or keep alive in their 
              memory the things that we have been, the grand, brave things that 
              some of our race have done, and I would stir up a longing, a determination 
              for the future that we must win back&hellip; . That is what I would 
              do. Murrey, even if it is a losing battle, fight it, fight it!&#148;</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">Yeovil cannot bring himself to take 
              this advice.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Meanwhile, the Germans are doing 
              their best to turn Britons into Germans, and one of the occupiers 
              has hit upon an eerily prescient set of weaknesses upon which to 
              play:</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;[T]here is the alchemy of 
              Sport and Drama to bring men of different races amicably together. 
              One or two sportsmanlike Germans on a London football team will 
              do more to break down racial antagonism than anything that Governments 
              or Councils can effect. As for the Stage, it has long been international 
              in its tendencies. You can see that every day.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">This German recognizes that the 
              older generation may never be won over, and that it will be necessary 
              to cultivate the young:</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">&#147;The youth of the country, 
              the generation that is at the threshold now. It is them that we 
              must capture. We must teach them to learn, and coax them to forget. 
              In course of time Anglo-Saxon may blend with German &hellip; .&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Indeed, as we know, if a generation 
              is got hold of early enough, with a will to &#147;teach them to 
              learn and coax them to forget,&#148; a great people can be made 
              into sheep in just a few decades.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3"><i>When William Came </i>has a happy 
              ending, but it is rather forced. At the best possible moment, under 
              the most dramatic circumstances, the younger generation peacefully 
              proves its loyalty to Britain, and we are led to believe that this 
              portends eventual liberation from German rule. However, there is 
              little in the novel up to that point to lend credence to this happy 
              ending; the author instead seems to be telling us that once enough 
              people are prepared to collaborate with the unthinkable, the unthinkable 
              becomes routine.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Clearly, there are no answers here 
              to the question of whether so many white Americans have come under 
              the spell of alien consciousness that liberation is impossible. 
              However, we know that for Munro, these were not merely abstract 
              or artistic questions. He appears to have been cut from the same 
              cloth as the young cleric who was intent on beating his enemies 
              into smithereens. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">At the age of 44 he enlisted in 
              the Royal Fusilliers as a private and refused a commission. He was 
              killed in combat in France in 1916. He was a far better man than 
              those who pass for the writers and &#147;artists&#148; of our time.</font></font></p>
