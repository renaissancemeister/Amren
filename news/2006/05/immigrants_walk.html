<h1>Immigrants Walk Off Jobs in Boycott</h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gillian Flaccus, AP, May 1, 2005</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LOS ANGELES &mdash; Hundreds of thousands of mostly Hispanic immigrants skipped work and took to the streets Monday, flexing their newfound political muscle in a nationwide boycott that succeeded in slowing or shutting many farms, factories, markets and restaurants.</p>
<p>From Los Angeles to Chicago, New Orleans to Houston, the &ldquo;Day Without Immigrants&rdquo; attracted widespread participation despite divisions among activists over whether a boycott would send the right message to Washington lawmakers considering sweeping immigration reform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my children to know their mother is not a criminal,&rdquo; said Benita Olmedo, a nanny who came here illegally in 1986 from Mexico and pulled her 11-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son from school to march in San Diego. &ldquo;I want them to be as strong I am. This shows our strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police estimated 300,000 people marched through Chicago&rsquo;s business district, and hundreds of thousands more were expected at rallies in New York and Los Angeles. Smaller rallies were planned in more than 50 other cities across the nation.</p>
<p>In heavily Hispanic Perth Amboy, N.J., a normally bustling business district was quiet and still. Block after block of record shops, cafes and produce stores were shuttered on the usually traffic-choked street.</p>
<p>In the Los Angeles area, normally bustling restaurants and markets were dark and truckers avoided the nation&rsquo;s largest shipping port. About one in three small businesses was closed downtown, including the cluttered produce market and fashion district.</p>
<p>Industries that rely on immigrant workers were clearly affected, though the impact was not uniform.</p>
<p>Tyson Foods Inc., the world&rsquo;s largest meat producer, shuttered about a dozen of its more than 100 plants and saw &ldquo;higher-than-usual absenteeism&rdquo; at others. Most of the closures were in states such as Iowa and Nebraska. Eight of 14 Perdue Farms chicken plants also closed for the day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>None of the 175 seasonal laborers who normally work Mike Collins&rsquo; 500 acres of Vidalia onion fields in southeastern Georgia showed up Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to be going wide open this time of year to get these onions out of the field,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got orders to fill. Losing a day in this part of the season causes a tremendous amount of problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the same story in Indiana, where the owner of a landscaping business said he was at a loss. About 25 Hispanic workers &mdash; 90 percent of the field work force &mdash; never reported Monday to Salsbery Brothers Landscaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re basically shut down in our busiest month of the year,&rdquo; said owner Jeff Salsbery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to cost me thousands of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
