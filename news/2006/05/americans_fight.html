<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50041">Americans Fight Back Against Illegals Influx</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Kovacs, WorldNetDaily.com, May 4, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the federal government having a perceived do-nothing attitude to stop the ongoing invasion of illegal aliens into the U.S., fed-up Americans are logging on to the Internet to fight their own battle. </p>
<p>A number of websites have popped up in recent days to not only help authorities identify and locate the unlawful workers, but also expose the employers who provide them jobs and help consumers patronize businesses that hire only legal citizens. </p>
<p>Among the newest is HireUSfirst.com, which looks to provide a national database with an easy-to-use map helping consumers find companies whose employees are legal. </p>
<p>&#147;Rather than outing businesses that hire illegals, we want to provide a listing of businesses that <i>refuse</i> to hire illegals, and encourage like minded consumers to patronize those businesses rather than spend their money at places that put their bottom line before the future of our country,&#148; founder Brett Gosch of Thornton, Colo., told WorldNetDaily. </p>
<p>&#147;We &hellip; understand that barring a [weapon of mass destruction] coming across one of our borders and vaporizing a city, our state and federal governments will <i>never</i> do anything serious about illegal immigration or border control. So the burden of doing something meaningful about it rests on the shoulders of common Americans,&#148; he writes on the site. </p>
<p>Another site is <a href="http://www.wehirealiens.com/">WeHireAliens.com</a>, an online Hall of Shame whose stated purpose is to expose &#147;alleged&#148; employers of illegal aliens. </p>
<p>&#147;The biggest incentive for illegal aliens to come to the United States is to find work,&#148; the site notes. &#147;If there are no employers willing to hire the illegal aliens, then the flood of illegal aliens will subside.&#148; </p>
<p>WeHireAliens currently has more than 1,300 employers from at least 43 states on its list. </p>
<p>The page also encourages consumers not to patronize the companies featured, and provides prewritten letters to let businesses know their traffic will suffer directly as a result of their use of unlawful workers. </p>
<p>For those interested in making sure authorities are kept in the loop, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.reportillegals.com/">ReportIllegals.com</a>, which, for $10, &#147;provides a simple, fast, and anonymous way to report illegal aliens and illegal employers to the appropriate U.S. government agencies. It takes only a few minutes to file a report with our service, whereas it would typically take you several hours on your own to find the proper agency and complete and submit a report.&#148; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.illegalaliens.us/">IllegalAliens.us</a> is a clearinghouse of information on the subject, and welcomes online visitors with the message, &#147;Calling an illegal alien an undocumented immigrant is like calling a burglar an uninvited house guest.&#148; </p>
<p>It even provides links to sites that sell merchandise on the heated subject. Among the featured items are $18 T-shirts with messages such as &#147;Secure Our Borders&#148; and &#147;Here Legally&#148; on a map of the United States. </p>
<p>&#147;Terrific for the grocery store or protest line,&#148; the ad for the &#147;Here Legally&#148; shirt states. &#147;You will be surprised at the overwhelmingly positive comments you&rsquo;ll receive.&#148; </p>
