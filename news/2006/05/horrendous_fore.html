<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A frustrated judge has admitted he was unable to order the deportation of a brutal rapist because the foreign criminal had been granted leave in Britain indefinitely. </p>
<p>The Somalian drug addict was allowed to remain in the country indefinitely while serving a jail sentence for attempted armed robbery, the Old Bailey heard today. </p>
<p>Unknown to immigration authorities at the time, Yonis Dirie had also raped a woman waiting at a bus stop four years earlier. </p>
<p>Justice caught up with Dirie today when he was jailed for 10 years after pleading guilty to raping his victim, now 37, as she was returning from a night out with friends. </p>
<p>But Dirie is not expected to face deportation at the end of his sentence because he was granted indefinite leave to remain here in 1994. </p>
<p>Judge Gerald Gordon QC, had asked whether he could recommend the 40-year-old be deported for what he described as &ldquo;a truly horrendous crime&rdquo;. </p>
<p>However, he was told Dirie could not be sent home unless the Home Secretary intervenes. </p>
<p>Speaking of Dirie&rsquo;s sanctuary in Britain he described it as &ldquo;a humanitarian gesture that you grossly abused by your conduct&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Dirie was arrested last year after a cold case rape investigation by the Metropolitan Police linked him to the attack by advances in DNA science. </p>
<p>His DNA was taken after he was arrested for possession of a bladed article. It linked him to the rape in Stratford, east London in January 1990. </p>
<p>Dirie from West Kensington, west London, has accumulated a string of convictions since his arrival in Britain in 1984 at the age of 18, the court was told. </p>
<p>After he was led to cells, Dirie&rsquo;s victim said she was shocked to hear of his history. &ldquo;He is here with the blessing of the authorities. Today it would not be surprising but this was over 20 years ago.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had heard Judge Gerald Gordon describe the attack on her a &ldquo;a truly horrendous crime.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dirie had raped her with another, unknown man. Afterwards they tossed her over a wall in panic &mdash; knowing there was a canal below where she could easily have drowned, said the judge. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She describes the attack as ruining the whole period of her 20s and 30s. She feels now she has finally come to terms &mdash; but what happened to her that night she feels, understandably, has devastated her life and that of her family and friends.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As she left court, Miss A said: &ldquo;Now I just want to get on with my life.&rdquo; </p>
<p>His previous convictions and immigration history was read out in court by prosecutor Alan Kent. </p>
<p>Dirie arrived in the UK in October 1984 from Somalia. He was given leave to enter as a visitor for one month. </p>
<p>The Home Office then received a letter asking leave to remain. He was interviewed, but in February 1986, his application was refused. His appeal was also refused. </p>
<p>But Dirie was then given a year to remain. A year later he was allowed another year and in 1988, granted a further &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; year leave to remain. </p>
<p>In February 1994 he was given the indefinite status. </p>
<p>In 1991 he had been put on two years probation for burglary. A month later he was ordered to do 200 hours community service for another burglary offence. </p>
<p>In March the following year, Dirie was fined £250 for possessing an offensive weapon. The following month he was put on probation for 18 months for obstructing police. </p>
<p>The next month he received a suspended 15 month jail sentence for burglary &mdash; with a supervision order. </p>
<p>The next year he was given four and a half years for the attempted robbery with a shotgun. </p>
<p>In February 1997, Dirie was fined for theft. In May that year he was put on probation for two years &mdash; again for theft. </p>
<p>That July he was jailed for six months for deception. Then came the arrest for possession of a blade which led to his DNA match. </p>
<p>Judge Gordon said that if drugs or drink had played a part in the rape it was no mitigation. He had heard that Dirie had been accepted for in-patient treatment for drug abuse shortly before his arrest.</p>
