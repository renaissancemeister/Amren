<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Australia&rsquo;s 22 terror suspects and their families receive more than $1 million a year in taxpayer-funded welfare and legal aid.</p>
<p>And simply because the men were locked up, their families received a social security pay rise of as much as $1700 a year. </p>
<p>One of the jailed Melbourne men, Abdul Nacer Benbrika &mdash; leader of a radical group of Islamists &mdash; has been in Australia for 10 years and has never had a job. </p>
<p>Taxpayers provide his wife with almost $50,000 a year in welfare. </p>
<p>A Sunday Herald Sun investigation uncovered generous payments to the families of men charged with plotting terror in Australia. </p>
<p>Adding tens of thousands of dollars in parenting payments, rent assistance and family tax benefits to the cost of legal services for the accused makes a total bill to taxpayers of more than $1 million. </p>
<p>Since November, 22 allegedly would-be terrorists have been arrested in Melbourne and Sydney under Operation Pendennis, a joint ASIO, AFP and state police forces operation. </p>
<p>Mr Benbrika was among 13 Melbourne men charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation. </p>
<p>Of Algerian descent, he has a Lebanese-born wife and seven children. </p>
<p>Under Centrelink rules, she is entitled to almost $50,000 a year in welfare while her husband is in prison, awaiting trial. </p>
<p>Ahmed Raad, another Melbourne suspect, has a child and his wife is entitled to about $21,500 a year, as are the wives of Ezzit Raad and Abdullah Merhi. </p>
<p>The wife of another suspect, Hany Taha, who has three children, is entitled to up to $30,000 a year. </p>
<p>Among nine Sydney suspects charged with conspiracy to carry out a terrorist attack was engineer Mohamed Ali Elomar, 40. He has five children and his wife is entitled to about $38,000 a year in taxpayer payments. </p>
<p>Omar Baladjam, a former actor on the ABC TV program Wildside, has two children. </p>
<p>A Centrelink spokeswoman said the fact someone had been jailed for terrorist offences did not stop their spouse or children receiving welfare. The maximum parenting payment increases from $377.50 a fortnight to $444.20 when a spouse is in jail, she said. </p>
<p>Two so-called &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; terrorist suspects, Jack &ldquo;Jihad&rdquo; Thomas and Shane Kent, also have children and benefit from Centrelink payments. </p>
<p>Mr Kent has two children, while Thomas, who is appealing against a conviction for receiving funds from a terrorist organisation, has three children. </p>
<p>Victims of crime groups expressed outrage at the payments. </p>
<p>People Against Lenient Sentencing president Steve Medcraft said it was an insult to law-abiding battling families. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you get an increased benefit when you go to jail? That&rsquo;s an insult to law and order,&rdquo; Mr Medcraft said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It never ceases to amaze me the way the system always favours the accused. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to jail, get three meals a day and free dental, medical and optical and your family gets an increased benefit.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Crime Victims Support Association spokesman Noel McNamara described the payments as disgraceful and said welfare benefits should be suspended when someone was charged with terrorism offences. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ludicrous that someone who is an alleged terrorist should receive benefits,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be immediately suspended and if they are found not guilty, pay it out then.&rdquo;</p>
