<h1><a href="https://www.sheffieldtoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=58&amp;ArticleID=1476452">Injured Cyclist Slams Court</a></h1>
					<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sheffield Today (UK), May 2, 2006</i></p>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cyclist Andrew Williams said he was deliberately mown down, chased and viciously beaten with a wheel brace after asking a motorist to be careful on the icy road. </p>
<p>The 49-year-old Sheffield Council worker had head injuries, a ripped thigh muscle and damaged groin and his cycle was mangled in the attack in Sharrow.</p>
<p>He was forced to take two months off work and had counselling for post traumatic stress. Months after the attack he wakes up sweating and has nightmares over his ordeal.</p>
<p>The regeneration worker, from Hope, slammed British justice as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; after his attacker Hamza Hussain received a non-custodial sentence at Sheffield Crown Court.</p>
<p>He hit out at the Crown Prosecution Service who reduced the charge of attempting to cause GBH with intent to affray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This attack was vicious and sustained and it has had a massive effect on me,&rdquo; said Mr Williams, who is back at work but still feels the physical and emotional affects. &ldquo;The sentence in court was disgraceful. What kind of deterrent is that? British justice is a joke sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Williams was riding his bike in Sharrow Street on a sunny but freezing day last December when Hussain nearly knocked him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got alongside him, tapped on his window and said politely &lsquo;just be careful&rsquo; because of the road conditions. It was icy,&rdquo; said Mr Williams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing, I heard his engine revving hard and wheels screeching. Somehow he managed to drive down the middle of two rows of gridlocked cars and then drove intentionally at me, sending me flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he chased me down the road with an iron bar and hit me over the head. The next thing a gang of about five Asian lads came at me. I was desperate for help and was shouting. There were dozens of other drivers and workers everywhere but everyone was too shocked or scared to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran off into a nearby school yard but the mob started kicking and punching me shouting &lsquo;kill the white bastard&rsquo;. If I had gone down I think that would have been it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamza Hussain, 18, of Club Garden Road, Sharrow, pleaded guilty to affray, possession of an offensive weapon and dangerous driving and received 250 hours community service and was told to pay £2,500 compensation to Mr Williams at £10 a week. He was barred from driving for two years.</p>
<p>The gang has not been traced.</p>
<p>A CPS spokeswoman said: &ldquo;Each case we handle is under continuous review.&rdquo;</p>
