<h1>Roswell Law Tackles Boardinghouse Trend</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Kaplan, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 12, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In college towns across America, including Athens, laws have been passed that limit the number of unrelated people who can live together in residential areas.</p>
<p>The idea is to prevent a bunch of college kids, each with a car, a girlfriend and buddies who can party all night, from disrupting a quiet single-family neighborhood.</p>
<p>Today, those laws are being copied in cities such Roswell that have no colleges.</p>
<p>What they have is a lot of immigrants, mainly Latinos, who work at low-paying jobs and try to economize by rooming together in low-priced housing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common to find 10 or more immigrants living in one house, and there have been reports of 20 living together, or even 30.</p>
<p>That creates the equivalent of boardinghouses in single-family neighborhoods, with transient men coming and going, sometimes at all hours.</p>
<p>Homeowners are complaining about it, and cities, including several in metro Atlanta, are responding with laws that impose heavy fines and even jail time for both landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>The issue has brought the emotional national debate over immigration policy down to the local level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until the issue of immigration reform is resolved at the federal level, it&rsquo;s going to continue to create this tension that exists at the local level,&rdquo; said Maritza Pichon, executive director of the Latin American Association, a social services organization.</p>
<p>Cities can help defuse that tension by bringing Hispanic leaders to the table to explore solutions before laws are imposed, Pichon said.</p>
<p>Residents and city officials in Roswell say the intent is not to keep out Hispanics or any other group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are or what your race is,&rdquo; said June Fletcher of Roswell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not judging you based on that. We&rsquo;re just concerned about our property values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roswell has responded by drafting a law that would allow no more than three unrelated people to live together in a single-family home. The penalty for ongoing violations would be up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine per day.</p>
<p>The proposed law goes to the city&rsquo;s Planning Commission on Tuesday and then to the City Council, where it appears to have broad support.</p>
