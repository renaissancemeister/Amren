<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black students and educators are denouncing a series of questions on the most recent global history Regents exam that they charge were racially biased and insensitive. </p>
<p>At least one student &mdash; Chantelle Jones, a junior at Bushwick Community High School in Brooklyn &mdash; said she was so outraged by the questions on the January test, she complained to the exam proctor. </p>
<p>She then ran out of time on the test&rsquo;s final essay, never finished it, and failed. She&rsquo;ll have to take the required test again in June. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me so upset,&rdquo; said Jones, 18. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disrespectful to me and my people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The questions &mdash; which asked students to describe how Africa benefited from imperialism &mdash; were on a section of the exam that gave students historical passages to read, then asked them to describe the arguments made by the author. </p>
<p>The first was based on an 1893 passage from &ldquo;The Rise of Our East African Empire,&rdquo; by Frederick Lugard, who, while working for the Imperial British East Africa Co. in the 19th century, helped colonize Uganda and other African countries. </p>
<p>On the exam, students were asked to read Lugard&rsquo;s account of British projects in Africa like digging wells and building irrigation systems, then to &ldquo;state two ways British imperialism would benefit Africans.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Next up was a passage from Lugard&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa,&rdquo; from 1922. It described British efforts to end the slave trade and reduce famine and disease. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are endeavoring &hellip; to teach the native races to conduct their own affairs with justice and humanity, and to educate them alike in letters and in industry,&rdquo; Lugard wrote. </p>
<p>Students were asked to name &ldquo;two ways the British improved the lives of Africans.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just beyond the pale,&rdquo; said Esmeralda Simmons, the executive director of the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College. </p>
