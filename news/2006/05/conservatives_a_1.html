						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; President Bush&rsquo;s plan to toughen border security may not be enough to overcome opposition within his own party to his &ldquo;earned-citizenship&rdquo; proposal, which critics decry as &ldquo;amnesty,&rdquo; House conservatives said Tuesday.</p>
<p>A day after outlining his immigration overhaul plan, Bush told reporters that an amnesty program for illegal immigrants would be wrong, but that his earned-citizenship proposal would be a fair part of a comprehensive bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amnesty would mean that more people would try to sneak into our country in hopes of being granted automatic citizenship,&rdquo; Bush said. &ldquo;But there ought to be a way for somebody to pay a fine or learn English or prove that they&rsquo;ve been here for a long time working, and be able to get in line &mdash; not at the head of the line but the back of the line &mdash; in order to become a citizen.&rdquo; (Watch how viewers liked Bush&rsquo;s speech &mdash; 2:29)</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House passed a bill last December that focused on measures to secure the borders but lacked guest worker and &ldquo;path toward citizenship&rdquo; proposals, which conservatives consider amnesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinly veiled attempts to promote amnesty cannot be tolerated,&rsquo; Republican Rep. Tom Price of Georgia told The Associated Press. &ldquo;While America is a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws, and rewarding those who break our laws not only dishonors the hard work of those who came here legally but does nothing to fix our current situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Republican Rep. J.D. Hayworth of Arizona told CNN that the Bush plan will not do well on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Senate insists on passing guest-work amnesty, and it returns to the House for a conference, the House leadership and, I think, the rank-and-file members, have made it clear the majority party is not going to entertain the notion of a guest-worker amnesty plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senate resumed debate Tuesday on legislation that would create a mechanism by which illegal immigrants could proceed toward legal status, and eventual citizenship, by working for a number of years, paying fines, undergoing a background check and learning English.</p>
<p>But in the House, lawmakers passed an immigration bill in December that contained neither a worker program nor a legalization process.</p>
<p>The Republican leaders of the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Majority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, praised Bush for his border-security proposals, but they were conspicuously silent on his support of a provision aimed at providing a path toward citizenship for illegal immigrants who are already in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Bush&rsquo;s nationally televised Oval Office address Monday night, he called for an immigration overhaul with five points:</p>
<p>&mdash;secure borders </p>
<p>&mdash;a temporary worker program </p>
<p>&mdash;holding employers to account </p>
<p>&mdash;a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the United States </p>
<p>&mdash;Congressional passage of comprehensive immigration legislation </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a CNN snap poll of 461 people who watched Monday&rsquo;s speech, 42 percent said they had a positive opinion of the president&rsquo;s immigration policies before they heard him speak. Afterward, 67 percent said they had a positive view, a jump of 25 percentage points.</p>
<p>The polled audience was 41 percent Republican, 23 percent Democratic and 36 percent independent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who watch the speech do tend to be somewhat more Republican than the voters as a whole,&rdquo; CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said. &ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t the best response he&rsquo;s gotten compared to other speeches, in fact it was lower than any speech we&rsquo;ve measured since he took office.&rdquo;</p>
