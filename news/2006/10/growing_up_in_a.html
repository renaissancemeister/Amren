<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Ethiopian poet, playwright and author Lemn Sissay, 39, was raised by a white family in the north of England. Here he tells how his life often felt like an experiment. </p>
<p>When somebody takes a child from their native culture, that is in itself an act of aggression. </p>
<p>People will often say, love is all you need. </p>
<p>But that is not true. Love without understanding is a dangerous thing. </p>
<p>My mother came to England in 1967, which was a really high point in Ethiopian culture &mdash; Ethiopia was a prosperous place. She came during what was a comfortable time for Ethiopians. </p>
<p>But as she found out, it was not a comfortable time for race relations in the UK. </p>
<p>My mother, finding herself in difficulties, sought to have me fostered for a short time. </p>
<p>However, the care worker, who named me Norman after himself, told my foster family that it was a proper adoption. </p>
<p>I was with them for 11 years. </p>
<p>My mother and father </p>
<p>Although they were white I believed they were my father and mother. </p>
<p>I had seen black people in the street or maybe even said hello but until I was 17 years old I never actually knew another black person. </p>
<p>From this I picked up subconscious messages of a kind of lazy racism living in the north of England. </p>
<p>My life was a bit like being an experiment. </p>
<p>Like anyone looking back would feel about growing up in an alien environment &mdash; one which treated them as an alien. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an afro comb until I was nine-years-old. My mother used to comb my hair with a metal comb that tore my head. When I was about nine, my parents took me to the doctor because they couldn&rsquo;t understand why my knees were grey. </p>
<p>I remember my mother often saying to me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me with those big brown eyes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She probably never meant it negatively but it meant that I grew up with a fear of my own eyes. </p>
<p>Trojan horse </p>
<p>My parents were very religious. They told me that they had not decided to take me in, rather that it was God that had decided it for them. </p>
<p>When I was 11 they put me into care. </p>
<p>To them I had become a Trojan horse that symbolised evil. They said that I was bringing evil into their home, that there was this mighty struggle inside me and that God was losing. </p>
<p>To be honest I think it was because they had since had another child and were struggling to provide for us all. </p>
<p>They told me they would never write to me or see me again. </p>
<p>My foster mother contacted me only once to tell me that my granddad had died. </p>
<p>I had always thought that I was going to go back to them. </p>
<p>I knew on an intellectual level that I wasn&rsquo;t their child but on an emotional level I believed I was their child. I didn&rsquo;t know the difference between fostering and adoption. </p>
<p>I have got rid of my anger. It is something that you get through it. </p>
<p>I have been very lost. I&rsquo;ve been very confused. But I&rsquo;ve always searched for answers. </p>
<p>And the ultimate answer is that the buck stops with yourself. </p>
<p>Uneasy relationship </p>
<p>I met my proper mum when I was 21. It took me three years to find her. </p>
<p>By that stage she worked for the UN in the Gambia. </p>
<p>I travelled out to see her. It was difficult because I looked just like my father had the last time she saw him. </p>
<p>My real mother is a survivor, very strong and respected by the people who know her but our relationship is not easy but then it was never going to be. </p>
<p>To Western parents that want to adopt a child, I would say to people that money is not everything, wealth does not matter. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me that you&rsquo;re adopting child to give them a better life. </p>
<p>Is that child then owing to you? And what do they owe? Shall they pay you back in emotions? </p>
<p>And that your view of other cultures and how they may be poor is your view &mdash; it says more about you than the place you&rsquo;re looking to adopt from. </p>
<p>Do you want the child because you want a better life for yourself? </p>
<p>I am not invalidating the love that you want to give but I am putting the rights of the child first. </p>
<p>Understand that it is your own experience that leads you to want to take a child from its culture, and display that child as your own in an alien environment. <br>

						</p>
											<p><em>Gold from the stone <br>
Oil from the Earth <br>
I yearned for my home <br>
From the time of my birth<br>
 <br>
Strength of a mothers whisper <br>
Shall carry me until <br>
The hand of my lost sister <br>
Joins onto my will<br>
 <br>
Root to the earth <br>
Blood from the heart <br>
Could never from birth <br>
Be broken apart </p>
<p>Food from the platter <br>
Water from the rain <br>
The subject and the matter <br>
I&rsquo;m going home again </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t sell a leaf to a tree <br>
Nor the wind to the atmosphere <br>
I know where I am meant to be <br>
And I can&rsquo;t be satisfied here<br>
 <br>
Can&rsquo;t give light to the Moon <br>
Nor mist to the drifting cloud <br>
I shall be leaving here soon <br>
Costumed, cultured and crowned </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t give light to the Sun <br>
Nor a drink to the sea <br>
The Earth I must stand upon <br>
I shall kiss with my history </p>
<p>Sugar from the cane <br>
Coal from the wood <br>
Water from the rain <br>
Life from the blood </p>
<p>Gold from the stone <br>
Oil from the earth <br>
I yearned for my home <br>
From the time of my birth<br>
 <br>
Food from the platter <br>
Water from the rain <br>
The subject and the matter <br>
I&rsquo;m going home again <br>
Gold from the stone <br>
Oil From the earth <br>
I yearned for my home <br>
From the time of my birth </em></p>
