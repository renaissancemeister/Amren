<h1>Engelman Stirs Up A Storm</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Post and Courier (Charleston, SC), Diette Courrégé, Oct. 18, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A comment made by Charleston County School Board member Sandi Engelman about the superintendent on a radio talk show Tuesday sparked a fire storm of criticism from officials and the community.</p>
<p>Engelman, who is running for re-election, said people misunderstood her meaning and that her comment wasn&rsquo;t racially derogatory.</p>
<p>The controversy started after she called in to &ldquo;The Morning Buzz&rdquo; with Richard Todd on WTMA-AM to defend herself from criticism of her taxpayer-financed travel first reported in The Post and Courier. At the end of the nine-minute phone call, Engelman said the district&rsquo;s superintendent, Maria Goodloe-Johnson, wasted money by forcing the district to pay for her missing a flight because she was late and operated on &ldquo;CPT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most people familiar with the acronym say that means &ldquo;Colored People Time,&rdquo; but Engelman said that&rsquo;s not what she meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you one quick thing before you go,&rdquo; Engelman said on show. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also from the flight to Chicago, the superintendent was on her usual &lsquo;CPT,&rsquo; missed her flight, came in and booked a first-class flight for hubby, daughter and herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Engelman said she&rsquo;s offended that people put words in her mouth and that she never said &ldquo;Colored People Time.&rdquo; Engelman said she intended for &ldquo;CPT&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;Certain People Time,&rdquo; which she said referred to influential people who are continually late.</p>
<p>Marvin Dulaney, executive director of the Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture and associate professor at the College of Charleston, laughed when he heard Engelman&rsquo;s explanation and said there was no such thing as &ldquo;Certain People Time.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;Colored People Time&rdquo; can be traced back in literature to the 1920s and in works by Langston Hughes. The expression references a stereotype that black people are always late, Dulaney said.</p>

<p>Goodloe-Johnson didn&rsquo;t buy Engelman&rsquo;s explanation for &ldquo;CPT,&rdquo; either. She denied Engelman&rsquo;s contention that she missed her flight and booked another on the district&rsquo;s dime for her family. Goodloe-Johnson said she thought it was sad that Engelman would think it&rsquo;s OK to make false and racist statements against the head of any organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School board Chairwoman Nancy Cook said Engelman had gone too far, and that a majority of board members shared Cook&rsquo;s perspective. All three of Engelman&rsquo;s challengers in the Nov. 7 election also condemned her statement.</p>
<p>Engelman said she thought the incident would help her in the race because voters were sick of people such as Goodloe-Johnson playing the race card. Engelman denied being a racist and said she opposes the superintendent for her poor business practices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dot Scott, president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, countered that Engelman has a problem with a black woman leading the district, and there&rsquo;s no excuse for what she said. Elected officials should be held to a higher standard, and Engelman insulted some people she&rsquo;s supposed to represent, Scott said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arthur Ravenel Jr., who is running for an East Cooper seat on the board, caught flack 16 years ago when he was in Congress and made a comment about white committee chairmen who operated on &ldquo;black time,&rdquo; which he said meant fashionably late. He equated Engelman&rsquo;s &ldquo;CPT&rdquo; comment to be the modern-day version of that expression and said he didn&rsquo;t think it was meant to be derogatory.</p>
