<h1>Schoolgirl Arrested For Refusing To Study With Non-English Pupils</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ThisIsLondon.co.uk, Oct. 12, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teenage schoolgirl was arrested by police for racism after refusing to sit with a group of Asian students because some of them did not speak English.</p>
<p>Codie Stott&rsquo;s family claim she was forced to spend three-and-a-half hours in a police cell after she was reported by her teachers.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old &mdash; who was released without charge &mdash; said it had been a simple matter of commonsense and accused the school and police of an over-the-top reaction.</p>
<p>The incident happened in the same local education authority where a ten-year-old boy was prosecuted earlier this year for calling a schoolfriend racist names in the playground, a move branded by a judge &ldquo;political correctness gone mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Codie was attending a GCSE science class at Harrop Fold High School in Worsley, Greater Manchester, when the incident happened.</p>
<p>The teenager had not been in school the day before due to a hospital appointment and had missed the start of a project, so the teacher allocated her a group to sit with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said I had to sit there with five Asian pupils,&rdquo; said Codie yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one could speak English, so she had to tell that one what to do so she could explain in their language. Then she sat me with them and said &lsquo;Discuss&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Codie, the five &mdash; four boys and a girl &mdash; then began talking in a language she didn&rsquo;t understand, thought to be Urdu, so she went to speak to the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not being funny, but can I change groups because I can&rsquo;t understand them?&rsquo; But she started shouting and screaming, saying &lsquo;It&rsquo;s racist, you&rsquo;re going to get done by the police&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Codie said she went outside to calm down where another teacher found her and, after speaking to her class teacher, put her in isolation for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>A complaint was made to a police officer based full-time at the school, and more than a week after the incident on September 26 she was taken to Swinton police station and placed under arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me to take my laces out of my shoes and remove my jewellery, and I had my fingerprints and photograph taken,&rdquo; said Codie. &ldquo;It was awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After questioning on suspicion of committing a section five racial public order offence, her mother Nicola says she was placed in a bare cell for three-and-a-half hours then released without charge.</p>
<p>She only returned to lessons this week and has been put in a different science class.</p>
<p>Yesterday Miss Stott, 37, a cleaner, said: &ldquo;Codie was not being racist.&rdquo; &ldquo;The reaction from the school and police is totally over the top and I am furious my daughter had to go through this trauma when all she was saying was common sense. &ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d have been better off not saying anything and getting into trouble for not being able to do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stott, who is separated from Codie and her 18-year-old brother Ashley&rsquo;s father, lives with her partner Keith Seanor, a 36-year-old cable layer, in Walkden.</p>
<p>School insiders acknowledge that at least three of the students Codie refused to sit with had recently arrived in this country and spoke little English.</p>
<p>But they say her comments afterwards raised further concerns, for example allegedly referring to the students as &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; &mdash; something she denied yesterday.</p>
<p>The school is now investigating exactly what happened before deciding what action &mdash; if any &mdash; to take against Codie.</p>
<p>Headteacher Dr Antony Edkins said: &ldquo;An allegation of a serious nature was made concerning a racially motivated remark by one student towards a group of Asian students new to the school and new to the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aim to ensure a caring and tolerant attitude towards people and pupils of all ethnic backgrounds and will not stand for racism in any form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fewer than two per cent of pupils at Harrop Fold come from an ethnic minority.</p>
<p>It had the worst GCSE results in the entire Salford LEA last year with just 15 per cent of pupils achieving five good passes including English and maths, a third of the national average.</p>
<p>Since being placed in special measures, Ofsted inspectors say it has improved, not least as a result of Dr Edkins&rsquo;s &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; leadership.</p>
<p>Salford was at the centre of a storm last April after a ten-year-old boy was hauled before a court for allegedly calling an 11-year-old mixed race pupil a &lsquo;Paki&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bin Laden&rsquo; in a playground argument at a primary school in Irlam.</p>
<p>When the case came before District Judge Jonathan Finestein he said the decision to prosecute showed &ldquo;how stupid the whole system is getting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But was himself fiercely attacked by teaching union leaders for &ldquo;feeding a pernicious agenda&rdquo; that aided the BNP.</p>
<p>The prosecution was eventually dropped.</p>
<p>Last night Robert Whelan, deputy director of the Civitas think-tank, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously common sense that pupils who don&rsquo;t speak English cause problems for other pupils and for teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this sort of thing happens all the time, but it&rsquo;s a sad reflection on the school if they can&rsquo;t deal with it without involving the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of these arrests don&rsquo;t result in prosecutions &mdash; they aim is to frighten us into self-censorship until we watch everything we say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greater Manchester Police denied Codie had been kept in a cell but would not comment further.<br>
