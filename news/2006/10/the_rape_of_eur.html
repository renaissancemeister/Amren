<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The German author <a href="http://www.henryk-broder.de/tagebuch/karikaturisten.html">Henryk M. Broder </a>recently <a href="http://ayaanhirsiali.web-log.nl/ayaanhirsiali/2006/10/wie_de_vrijheid.html">told the Dutch newspaper <em>De Volkskrant</em> </a>(12 October) that young Europeans who love freedom, better emigrate. Europe as we know it will no longer exist 20 years from now. Whilst sitting on a terrace in Berlin, Broder pointed to the other customers and the passers-by and said melancholically: &ldquo;We are watching the world of yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Europe is turning Muslim. As Broder is sixty years old he is not going to emigrate himself. &ldquo;I am too old,&rdquo; he said. However, he urged young people to get out and &ldquo;move to Australia or New Zealand. That is the only option they have if they want to avoid the plagues that will turn the old continent uninhabitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Germans and Dutch, apparently, did not wait for Broder&rsquo;s advice. The number of emigrants leaving the <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/331">Netherlands </a>and <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/1191">Germany </a>has already surpassed the number of immigrants moving in. One does not have to be prophetic to predict, like Henryk Broder, that Europe is becoming Islamic. Just consider the demographics. The number of Muslims in contemporary Europe is estimated to be 50 million. It is expected to double in twenty years. By 2025, one third of all European children will be born to Muslim families. Today Mohammed is already the most popular name for new-born boys in Brussels, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and other major European cities.</p>
<p>Broder is convinced that the Europeans are not willing to oppose islamization. &ldquo;The dominant ethos,&rdquo; he told De Volkskrant, &ldquo;is perfectly voiced by the stupid blonde woman author with whom I recently debated. She said that it is sometimes better to let yourself be raped than to risk serious injuries while resisting. She said it is sometimes better to avoid fighting than run the risk of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a recent op-ed piece in the Brussels newspaper <em>De Standaard</em> (23 October) the Dutch (gay and self-declared &ldquo;humanist&rdquo;) author Oscar Van den Boogaard refers to Broder&rsquo;s interview. Van den Boogaard says that to him coping with the islamization of Europe is like &ldquo;a process of mourning.&rdquo; He is overwhelmed by a &ldquo;feeling of sadness.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not a warrior,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but who is? I have never learned to fight for my freedom. I was only good at enjoying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Tom Bethell wrote in this month&rsquo;s <em>American Spectator:</em> &ldquo;Just at the most basic level of demography the secular-humanist option is not working.&rdquo; But there is more to it than the fact that non-religious people tend not to have as many children as religious people, because many of them prefer to &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; freedom rather than renounce it for the sake of children. Secularists, it seems to me, are also less keen on fighting. Since they do not believe in an afterlife, this life is the only thing they have to lose. Hence they will rather accept submission than fight. Like the German feminist Broder referred to, they prefer to be raped than to resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If faith collapses, civilization goes with it,&rdquo; says Bethell. That is the real cause of the <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/852">closing of civilization in Europe.</a> Islamization is simply the consequence. The very word Islam means &ldquo;submission&rdquo; and the secularists have submitted already. Many Europeans have already become Muslims, though they do not realize it or do not want to admit it.</p>
<p>Some of the people I meet in the U.S. are particularly worried about the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. They are correct when they fear that anti-Semitism is also on the rise among non-immigrant Europeans. The latter hate people with a fighting spirit. Contemporary anti-Semitism in Europe (at least when coming from native Europeans) is related to anti-Americanism. People who are not prepared to resist and are eager to submit, hate others who do not want to submit and are prepared to fight. They hate them because they are afraid that the latter will endanger their lives as well. In their view everyone must submit.</p>
<p>This is why they have come to hate Israel and America so much, and the small band of European &ldquo;islamophobes&rdquo; who dare to talk about what they see happening around them. West Europeans have to choose between submission (<em>islam</em>) or death. I fear, like Broder, that they have chosen submission &mdash; just like in former days when they preferred to be red rather than dead.<br>
