						<p>Berkeley, Calif. &mdash; If the University of California challenges the state ban on affirmative action, the timing will need to be right, UC President Robert Dynes said Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a daylong conference on the effects and future of Proposition 209, Dynes and others said California&rsquo;s demographics eventually will change enough to overturn the 1996 voter-approved ban.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely want to win the first [lawsuit], because if we lose the first one, we will take two to three steps back,&rdquo; Dynes said. &ldquo;We should be pushing sensibly with a reasonable probability of our winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enrollment of black and Hispanic students dipped precipitously across the UC system after Prop. 209 took effect, especially at the most selective campuses, such as UC Berkeley and UCLA.</p>
<p>The numbers have slowly rebounded, but university leaders have pushed for more reforms.</p>
<p>At the Berkeley conference, educators and administrators said the admissions process in particular needs to change to prevent minority students from being affected unfairly by grade-point average and test-score requirements. The system&rsquo;s nine undergraduate campuses admit the top 12.5 percent of high school seniors, based on grades, SAT scores and other factors.</p>
<p>Before Prop. 209, public universities also used race among admissions criteria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think 209 is profoundly wrong, morally wrong,&rdquo; said UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau, a frequent critic of the affirmative-action ban in the two years since he arrived in California.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have a truly fair system until 209 is reversed,&rdquo; he said to applause.</p>

															<h2>UC Talks Of Wider Entrance Policy</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Lisa M. Krieger, Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.), October 28, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>A panel of influential educational scholars recommends an overhaul of the 40-year-old University of California eligibility process, urging a shift away from the current focus on grades and SAT scores to a broader review of students&rsquo; personal achievements, such as initiative and leadership.</p>
<p>The move, presented for the first time at a UC-Berkeley conference Friday, is seen as a way to expand economic, racial and geographic diversity in one of America&rsquo;s premier public educational institutions. It could enable the UC system to admit more students, boosting the number of educated people in a state that is falling far behind others. But the program would require more state spending because campuses would have to be expanded for additional students.</p>
<p>It also could stiffen competition for slots at the most popular campuses for Santa Clara County high school students, whose strong academic credentials have traditionally assured them entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are discussing ways that would allow the campuses to take a look at a broader swath of students than they do now,&rsquo;&rsquo; said UC-Davis Professor Mark Rashid, who heads the committee that creates recommendations for UC admissions policy and who contributed to the paper &ldquo;California at the Crossroads,&rsquo;&rsquo; which proposes the change.</p>
<p>UC officials have grown increasingly concerned about what they see as an unequal access to the system.</p>
<p><strong>Other criteria</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;GPA is one single measure of a student&rsquo;s academic achievement. But there are many other things to look at,&rsquo;&rsquo; Rashid said. &ldquo;Doing things the way we do now does not necessarily result in admitting the students who do best at UC.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>High school grade-point averages and SATs have been shown to correlate with only a minor part of a student&rsquo;s ultimate success in college, according to the paper. But the emphasis causes teachers and students to &ldquo;treat UC admissions as a high-stakes game, won by those who can play it best,&rsquo;&rsquo; it said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Broader review</strong></p>
<p>The recommendation would mean that students with a C+ (2.75 GPA) average, who were likely to be shut out under the old system, would now be eligible to have their applications reviewed &mdash; giving them the opportunity to list leadership positions, jobs or ways in which they have triumphed over adversity. Low SAT scores, while still considered, would not close the door.</p>
<p>However, acceptance to a specific campus &mdash; say, Berkeley or Los Angeles &mdash; would still require stellar performance in both academic and non-academic realms.</p>
<p>Signed into law by Gov. Pat Brown in 1960, California&rsquo;s master plan of college eligibility has guaranteed a spot at UC for the top 12.5 percent of the state&rsquo;s high school graduates, based on test scores and grades earned in UC-approved college prep courses.</p>
<p>But that approach has widened the &ldquo;achievement gap&rsquo;&rsquo; in the increasingly diverse state. Access to UC schools for many racial and ethnic minorities and for students at &ldquo;disadvantaged high schools,&rsquo;&rsquo; as defined by socioeconomics or geography, is consistently low.</p>
<p>The access problem was exacerbated in 1995 when UC regents voted to end race as a factor in admissions, then extended in 1996 with passage of the anti-affirmative-action Proposition 209.</p>
<p>Beginning with the 1998 entering class, there was a dip in the proportion of African-Americans, Latinos and American Indians on UC campuses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the UC system is allowed to expand, increased access for some does not mean decreased access for others, said William Kidder of UC-Davis, another contributor to the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a practical matter, if a student has a very high GPA and has taken a large number of honors classes and has very solid SATs, that student is still very likely to be admitted to a UC campus, although perhaps not the campus of first choice,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some critics say that research, not diversity, is the main purpose of UC, and there should not be a lowering of the academic standard for eligibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see increased diversity but I am in favor of getting there one step at a time &mdash; from the community colleges, to California State University, to UC &mdash; and not give someone a special privilege to attempt three steps in one,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Lester Lee, who was the first Chinese-American member of the board of regents, where he served from 1993 to 1994.</p>
