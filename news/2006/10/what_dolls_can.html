<h1><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2553348&amp;page=1">What Dolls Can Tell Us About Race In America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ABC News, October 11, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new short film by a New York City high school student asks how far our society has come in its attitude toward race since the 1940s. </p>
<p>In her film, &ldquo;A Girl Like Me,&rdquo; Kiri Davis recreates a famous 1940s experiment conducted by Dr. Kenneth Clark that studied the psychological effects of segregation on black children. </p>
<p>In Clark&rsquo;s test, children were given a black doll and a white doll, and then asked which one they thought was better. </p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, they chose the white doll. </p>
<p>Davis asked 4 and 5-year-old kids at a Harlem school the same question in 2005. She found the children&rsquo;s answers were not that different. </p>
<p>In Davis&rsquo; test, 15 of the 21 children said that the white doll was good and pretty, and that the black doll bad. </p>
<p>Clark concluded that &ldquo;prejudice, discrimination and segregation&rdquo; caused black children to develop a sense of inferiority and self-hatred. </p>
<p>The experiment also influenced the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, which outlawed school segregation. </p>
<p>Davis, who was 16 years old when she made the film, said the results of her experiment surprised and frustrated her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So many things have changed, yet so many things haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said on &ldquo;Good Morning America.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;In terms of children as young as 5 and 4 still being able to tell what America values and what it doesn&rsquo;t, it still happens.&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>Kids Internalize Stereotypes at Young Age </strong></p>
<p>In the powerful film, Davis asks a little girl, &ldquo;Can you show me the doll that looks bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl immediately chooses the black doll. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does that look bad?&rdquo; Davis asks. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s black,&rdquo; the girl responds. </p>
<p>Davis said that the children in the study did not hesitate when asked to choose the &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; doll. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just, boom, which is the good doll. They said because the white one is the good one, the black one is the bad one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They internalize these stereotypes that are out there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But the same little girl seemed to hesitate when she was asked to select the doll that looked like her. </p>
<p>She seemed to want to choose the white doll, and then reluctantly picked the black one. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It just shows &hellip; what they think society values,&rdquo; Davis said. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t realize at such a young age these children really get it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Davis said that the children&rsquo;s parents were also shocked when they saw the film. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Many didn&rsquo;t want to believe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s still going on,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Davis conducted her experiment at a Harlem day-care center, and the film has become part of the curriculum there. </p>
