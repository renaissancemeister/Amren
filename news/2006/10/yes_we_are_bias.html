<h1>Yes, We Are Biased On Religion And Politics, Admit BBC Executives</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail, Paul Revoir, Oct. 23, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BBC executives have been forced to admit what critics have known for years &mdash; that the corporation is institutionally biased.</p>
<p>The revelation came after details of an &lsquo;impartiality&rsquo; summit called by its chairman, Michael Grade, were leaked.</p>
<p>Senior figures admitted that the BBC is guilty of promoting Left-wing views and an anti-Christian sentiment.</p>
<p>They also said that as an organisation it was disproportionately over-represented by gays and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>It was also suggested that the Beeb is guilty of political correctness, the overt promotion of multiculturalism and of being anti-American and against the countryside.</p>
<p>During the meeting, hosted by Sue Lawley, executives admitted they would happily broadcast the image of a Bible being thrown away &mdash; but would not do the same for the Koran.</p>
<p>Muslim leaders later condemned this approach.</p>
<p>Ishmail Farhat of the Muslim Association of Britain said: &#8220;We don&rsquo;t support this kind of action or abuse. If they are respecting all religions &mdash; then they should treat all religions the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BBC executives also agreed that the BBC should broadcast an interview with Osama Bin Laden, despite the offence it would cause.</p>
<p>Even one of the BBC&rsquo;s most senior journalists, political pundit Andrew Marr admitted that the corporation was unrepresentative of British society.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The BBC is not impartial or neutral. It&rsquo;s a publicly-funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities and gay people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has a liberal bias not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>BBC &lsquo;diversity tsar&rsquo; Mary Fitzpatrick claimed women newsreaders should be allowed to wear what they liked on air and went on to say this should include a Muslim veil.</p>
<p>She spoke out after criticism was raised of TV newsreader Fiona Bruce wearing a necklace with a cross on it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We may have gone too far in the direction of political correctness&rsquo;</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Washington correspondent Justin Webb also accused his own employers of being anti-American saying they treated it with scorn and derision and &#8220;no moral weight&#8221;.</p>
<p>He revealed that he had got deputy director general Mark Byford to secretly help him to &#8220;correct&#8221; it in his reports.</p>
<p>Business presenter Jeff Randall said he complained to a senior executive at the BBC about the corporation&rsquo;s pro-multiculturalism stance.</p>
<p>He claimed he was told: &#8220;The BBC is not neutral in multiculturalism, it believes in it and it promotes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told how he once wore Union Jack cufflinks to work and was rebuked with: &#8220;You can&rsquo;t do that, that&rsquo;s like the National Front!&#8221;</p>
<p>One senior BBC executive admitted that the summit had opened people&rsquo;s eyes to how biased the BBC had become.</p>
<p>He admitted: &#8220;There was a widespread acknowledgement that we may have gone too far in the direction of political correctness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, much of it is so deeply embedded in the BBC&rsquo;s culture, that it is very hard to change it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BBC is believed to be taking a more critical look at itself because it fears if it does not, its regulation could be removed from its board of governors and handed over to the independent regulator Ofcom.<br>
