<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In a rural area some 200km east of Harare, a play is being acted out.</p>
<p>An HIV-positive man visits a traditional healer and is advised to have sex with a virgin in order to be cured.</p>
<p>The reasoning is that the blood produced by raping a virgin will cleanse the virus from the infected person&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>It is part of the Girl Child Network project and was staged at a girl&rsquo;s empowerment village, where rape survivors are given safe accommodation, counselling and training in life-skills.</p>
<p>Traditional healers from all of the country&rsquo;s provinces recently attended a meeting here, along with chiefs, a government minister and religious leaders, where many of the girls stood up and gave accounts of the abuse that they had suffered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Traumatised&rsquo;</p>
<p>One was raped by her father when she was two years old.</p>
<p>She is now eight, and an orphan, as her father died in prison after the rape was reported by her mother, who has also died.</p>
<p>A 14-year-old told how her uncle raped her and left her pregnant.</p>
<p>She was thrown out of the house by her aunt and had an abortion after six months. There were complications and she has been ill ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m traumatised,&#8221; she said, in floods of tears.</p>
<p>All of the groups represented were moved by the vivid accounts and condemned the abuse, but none admitted responsibility for encouraging sex with virgins to cure HIV.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No medicine to cure Aids&rsquo;</p>
<p>National Traditional Healers Association secretary Alex Mashoko blamed healers not registered with his organisation</p>
<p>&#8220;We have heard about this for a long time and really, as an organisation we want to crush the people that have been doing that through the chiefs and through the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government must give tough penalties on this. Those crooks don&rsquo;t want to come and register.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I have been practising traditional healing I have never done a thing like that. I have only read about it in the papers but I have never seen someone doing things like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t accept things like that. It is not good.</p>
<p>&#8220;We as an organisation don&rsquo;t tell people to sleep with girls so that it can cure Aids because there is no medicine to cure Aids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same fate</p>
<p>Girl Child Network director Betty Makoni, felt that although no-one took responsibility for the abuse of young girls, the meeting was a &#8220;quite a step forward&#8221; in confronting the myth that virgins cure HIV.</p>
<p>Explaining, she said: &#8220;Not everybody is doing it, as they were saying, but it is happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu spoke out against the rape of girls as young as nine months old in his country.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say whether the problem is increasing or not here, but South Africa is clearly not the only affected country &mdash; many children in Zimbabwe and the rest of southern Africa have suffered the same fate.</p>
