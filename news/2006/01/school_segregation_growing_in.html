<h1>School Segregation Growing In California, Study Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa M. Krieger, San Jose Mercury News, Jan. 17, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California&rsquo;s schools are among the most segregated in the nation &mdash; and they are becoming even more divided, with Latino and African-American students clustered together and isolated from whites, according to a study released this week by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University.</p>
<p>This trend &mdash; driven by economic, policy and demographic changes within the state &mdash; compounds the disadvantages of Latino and black students. And white students miss an important lesson about life in a diverse society, the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Segregation is growing in degree and complexity as the nation becomes increasingly multiracial,&rdquo; said Gary Orfield, lead author of the report and director of the project. &ldquo;We have to get away from thinking of segregation as something that came out of the Old South &mdash; and think about how it&rsquo;s happening in the new California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The findings hold true even in diverse Silicon Valley. In the San Jose Unified School District, the average black student in 1991 went to a school with 40 percent white students and 40 percent Latino students. By 2003, that changed to 28 percent white students and 50 percent Latinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They found that in 2003, the average Latino student in the state attended a school with 19 percent white students, down from about 50 percent in 1970. The average black student in California attended a school with 22 percent white students in 2003, down from 26 percent in 1970.</p>
<p>Asian-Americans are the most integrated racial group. Even when they are in predominantly minority schools, they are seldom in schools overwhelmingly Asian, and are unlikely to have the kind of &ldquo;linguistic segregation&rdquo; that affects Latino students, the study found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is not because of a flight to private schools, as seen after the civil rights era, Orfield said. The reasons for today&rsquo;s segregation: Minorities tended to move to the cities, while whites moved to the suburbs. Also, Latinos and blacks tend to have more children. &ldquo;These groups are inheriting the city,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, more than four of every five U.S. students were white; in 2003, 58 percent were white &mdash; and the numbers drop each year.</p>
