<div align="left"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, Feb. 2004</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Martin 
              Luther King, Jr. was undoubtedly the most famous black activist 
              of what is known as the civil rights period. He was an adulterer, 
              plagiarizer, and Communist sympathizer, but even in the 1950s and 
              &lsquo;60s the white establishment was hesitant to criticize so eloquent 
              a spokesman for racial integration. By the time of King&rsquo;s assassination 
              in 1968, he was an advisor to presidents, Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
              and recipient of countless honorary degrees. </font></p>
            <div align="left"></div>
                        <p><font size="3">As was the case with Presidents Lincoln 
              and Kennedy, assassination at a time of national prominence probably 
              ensured far greater fame than would have a full career. King was 
              a man of abiding flaws that would have become impossible to ignore. 
              Also, once the traditional &#147;civil rights&#148; program of integration, 
              voting rights, and racial preferences was achieved, he would have 
              had to endorse ever-more radical demands&mdash;demands that would 
              have cost white support&mdash;to keep from losing the limelight to 
              Black Muslims, Black Panthers, and other militants. Indeed, although 
              King is still an obligatory hero to whites, many blacks now think 
              of him as something of a trimmer and a Tom, certainly in comparison 
              to someone like Malcolm X.</font></p>

<font size="3">Assassination, therefore, came at 
              the perfect time to establish a glowing King legacy. It also came 
              at the perfect time to establish for his widow and children a well-paid 
              profession as bereaved family members of the Great Man and official 
              custodians of the legacy.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The very year of the assassination, 
              Mrs. Coretta King established the Martin Luther King Jr. Center 
              for Nonviolent Social Change. It has some exhibits and a gift shop, 
              but its main job appears to be to cash in on martyrdom. The family&rsquo;s 
              pursuit of money has been so single-minded it has often made it 
              hard for others to use King&rsquo;s name and words, and its constant 
              demand for royalties has sometimes blocked even the most favorable 
              portrayals. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The Kings have copyrighted nearly 
              every word the patriarch uttered, and are ruthless about asserting 
              their rights. In 1993, for example, the family sued <i>USA Today</i>, 
              which had celebrated the 30th anniversary of the 1,600-word &#147;I 
              Have a Dream&#148; speech by reprinting it. The family would not 
              relent, and the newspaper finally paid a $1,700 reprint fee, plus 
              the King Center&rsquo;s considerable legal costs. In the current 
              era of abasement, few were rude enough to point out that such punctilious 
              insistence on intellectual property rights ill becomes the family 
              of a man who was, himself, a life-long plagiarist.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">In 1996, the King Center sued CBS 
              because it included excerpts from the &#147;dream&#148; speech in 
              a five-part video series called <i>The 20th Century with Mike Wallace</i>. 
              CBS had filmed the speech in 1963, and not surprisingly thought 
              it had the right to its own archives. The King center thought otherwise, 
              and sued for royalties, giving up only after it lost both in trial 
              court and on appeal.</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">The saintly veil that has been cast 
              over King and everything he touched has no doubt kept a lot of ugly 
              maneuvering out of the public eye, but by 1987 the pattern was clear. 
              That year, Mrs. King and the King Center sued Boston University 
              to get back 83,000 King papers the university had held since the 
              1960s. The King Center already had more than 100,000 such papers 
              but wanted every single one. After six years of legal skirmishing, 
              the case went to trial. Boston University produced a 1964 letter 
              from King saying his papers were to become the university&rsquo;s 
              &#147;absolute property&#148; upon his death. Mrs. King claimed 
              never to have seen the letter. The university then produced a letter 
              she herself had written in 1967 acknowledging the existence of the 
              earlier letter. Mrs. King then switched tactics and insisted King 
              had changed his mind about where the papers were to end up, but 
              could show no evidence for this. A jury&mdash;including two blacks 
              and a Hispanic&mdash;found for the university in 1987, but Mrs. King 
              would not back down. She kept the appeal process going until she 
              lost decisively in 1995.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">When it comes to suing, the Kings 
              judge not by the color of someone&rsquo;s skin but by the content 
              of his bank account. Henry Hampton is a black film producer who 
              made the now-famous civil rights television series,<i> Eyes on the 
              Prize</i>, which was broadcast in 1987 with a sequel in 1990. In 
              1992, the family demanded money from Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s production 
              company Blackside, Inc. because the series used footage of Rev. 
              King. Mr. Hampton offered $100,000. The family sneered at this figure 
              and launched what Mr. Hampton called &#147;an aggressive attempt 
              to get an enormous amount of money,&#148; adding that &#147;they 
              seemed to have the notion that millions of dollars were available.&#148; 
              Several broadcasters that had planned to rerun the series shelved 
              the idea for fear of being dragged into the suit. When the Kings 
              refused to back down, Mr. Hampton countersued, charging that the 
              family&rsquo;s threats &#147;had a chilling effect on Blackside&rsquo;s 
              right of free speech.&#148; The parties eventually settled out of 
              court for considerably less than the $100,000 Mr. Hampton had originally 
              offered. The Kings clearly think lining their own pockets is more 
              important than letting other people&mdash;no matter how admiring&mdash;spread 
              the great man&rsquo;s wisdom.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Everyone in the family seems to have 
              an eye for swag, and some charge for interviews. According to a 
              German television company, the youngest of King&rsquo;s children, 
              Bernice, &#147;wanted to have $4,000 or $5,000 for one interview, 
              ten minutes.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">By the time the Kings got into a fight 
              with the National Park Service, their reputation for money-grubbing 
              was so bad even liberals were disgusted. In 1980, the family had 
              asked the Park Service to help administer the part of Atlanta now 
              known as the King Historic District. This sycophantic designation 
              includes King&rsquo;s house and the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where 
              he preached. The feds turned the area into the third most popular 
              historic site in America after the Statue of Liberty and Independence 
              Hall in Philadelphia&mdash;and paid the King Center $535,000 a year 
              for the privilege. In 1994, the Park Service started work on an 
              $11.8 million visitor center across the street from the King Center. 
              Although they had known of the project for years, the family waited 
              until construction had begun before pushing for more money. Led 
              by Rev. King&rsquo;s son Dexter, the family announced the new center 
              would cut into its own gift shop revenues and compete with an &#147;interactive 
              museum&#148; they were thinking of building. As compensation, they 
              asked the Park Service to triple its annual fee to $1.5 million. 
              The service said no.</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">The Kings then held a press conference 
              to explain that the bureaucrats they had worked with profitably 
              for 15 years were now no better than James Earl Ray. Coretta King 
              said, &#147;The same evil forces that destroyed Martin Luther King 
              are now trying to destroy my family. We are more determined than 
              ever that they who slew the dreamer will not slay the dream.&#148; 
              Dexter King claimed the white man was at it again, trying &#147;to 
              annex this area to control the dissemination of history.&#148; &#147;Our 
              history has always been diluted,&#148; he explained; &#147;we can 
              tell our history. We know best.&#148; Of course, the dream would 
              remain unslain, all accusations of diluting history would be withdrawn, 
              and the government could go ahead with its visitor center if the 
              Park Service would only ante up another $1 million a year.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">This was too much even for many blacks. 
              Congressman John Lewis, who had been one of King&rsquo;s collaborators, 
              sided with the Park Service. Even Joseph Roberts, then minister 
              of Ebenezer Baptist Church, called the King family&rsquo;s demands 
              &#147;high-handed, dictatorial and undemocratic.&#148; Cynthia Tucker, 
              a black woman who edits the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>&rsquo;s 
              editorial page and who never misses a chance to shout &#147;racism,&#148; 
              accused the Kings of &#147;shortsighted leadership&#148; and &#147;profit 
              mongering.&#148; People began to point out that the King Center 
              is supposed to be dedicated to &#147;research, education and training 
              in nonviolent philosophy and strategy,&#148; but all it does is 
              peddle &#147;the legacy.&#148; The Park Service went ahead with 
              its visitor center but left some of the exhibits pointedly empty 
              because the Kings refused to turn over papers and artifacts they 
              had promised.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">For years the family took the pious 
              view that King&rsquo;s image was not to be commercialized, and sued 
              anyone so crude as to try. In 1982 the Georgia Supreme Court upheld 
              its copyright on all representations of King, in a case against 
              American Heritage Products, which was selling statuettes for $29.95. 
              In 1996, however, the lure of lucre won out over piety. The center 
              authorized a Lladro statue and rushed a series of pins and medallions 
              onto the market in time for the Atlanta Olympics. A line of King-image 
              personal checks is now available, and there is talk of a Hollywood 
              biography that could be directed by Oliver Stone. In 1997, the family 
              swung a deal with Time Warner to bring out MLK books, CDs, and a 
              web page. Estimated revenue for the King Center: $10 million a year. 
              Recently, the Kings have rented out the patriarch&rsquo;s words and 
              image for advertising. Atlanta-based Cingular, a cellular telephone 
              company, and the French telecommunications company Alcatel have 
              both run King ads. In one, King&rsquo;s voice is featured with several 
              others, including that of Kermit the Frog. There is no telling what 
              could come next, now that Dexter King has visited Graceland&mdash;twice&mdash;to 
              see how the Elvis &#147;legacy&#148; is marketed.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">In 1995, the family once more set 
              its priorities straight by shutting down the King holiday commission. 
              Mrs. King had spent ten years building up the organization, which 
              promoted celebration of the King national holiday. As soon as it 
              reached a certain prominence, it became a fund-raising competitor 
              to the King Center. It was best to kill the commission&mdash;which 
              only promoted King and &#147;civil rights,&#148; after all&mdash;so 
              as to clear the field for the center that pays the King family salaries.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Another recent money-grub has once 
              again been over papers. In 1999, the family condescended to let 
              the Library of Congress take custody of the papers still in Atlanta, 
              in a deal that would keep the copyright firmly in family hands. 
              The King Center would no longer have to bother with looking after 
              100,000 papers, but could still charge fat reprint fees. The family 
              had had the papers appraised for $40 million, so it pronounced itself 
              generous in offering custody for a mere $20 million. The library 
              didn&rsquo;t see it that way. It expects to have full use of personal 
              papers in its collections, not just the joy of knowing they are 
              there, and gets most of its materials by donation. Its most expensive 
              purchase ever was a $1.5 million 1930 acquisition of medieval manuscripts 
              that included a Gutenberg Bible. Even the U. S. Congress, which 
              will usually do anything in the name of racial atonement, jibbed 
              at $20 million, and the King family is no longer pushing the deal.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">The latest example of eye-opening 
              greed is the King family&rsquo;s demand for a hefty &#147;licensing&#148; 
              fee to let the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial planned for the 
              Washington Mall use the King name. In 1996, President Clinton signed 
              legislation setting aside four acres adjoining the tidal basin, 
              and promising full maintenance for the memorial, but no federal 
              funds can be used to build it. There is a deadline of November, 
              2003, to scrape together $100 million for the thing, but major donors 
              are unwilling to stump up so long as the King family refuses to 
              release the name. Tommy Hilfiger had promised $5 million and General 
              Motors was going to give $10 million, but they will not write checks 
              until the &#147;licensing&#148; problem is cleared up.</font></p>

            <p><font size="3">A monument on the Capitol Mall is 
              about the highest honor the nation can pay. Leave it to the King 
              family to see it as a chance to screw more money out of people. 
              At one point, they were about to offer the King name for a flat 
              $600,000 but are now back to dickering over a percentage of the 
              money raised for the memorial. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3">There is some fear that Alpha Phi 
              Alpha, which was King&rsquo;s fraternity and is the group leading 
              the project, may have to ask Congress to extend the seven-year fund-raising 
              period. General Motors has already provided $750,000 for &#147;setup 
              activities,&#148; but that is long gone. At least a third of it 
              disappeared in September, 2000, in connection with a lavish celebration 
              announcing the winner of the memorial design competition. It would 
              be a blessing to the country if the King family&rsquo;s greed were 
              so great it kept the Mall free of the memorial, but Congress will 
              certainly vote an extension of the fund-raising period if it is 
              needed, and whites will eventually offer enough money to satisfy 
              the poor, grieving, bereaved family.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Which, of course, is the real problem. 
              It is easy to scoff at the King family&rsquo;s transparent greed, 
              but who is to blame? Mrs. King and the children can be forgiven 
              for thinking &#147;Dr.&#148; King was the most important American&mdash;perhaps 
              the most important human&mdash;who ever lived. He and Jesus Christ 
              alone share the distinction of federal holidays on their birthdays. 
              King, who stands far higher in official estimation than such slaveholding 
              wretches as George Washington or Thomas Jefferson, is an American 
              saint who brought the promise of American liberty and democracy 
              to full fruition. It is whites, of course, who have led or at least 
              acquiesced in a canonization they could have stopped any time. All 
              the black frauds and con-men like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, 
              and every one of their local variants would be nobodies if whites 
              didn&rsquo;t pay attention to them.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">But in letting the King myth expand 
              to preposterous size whites have sorely burdened the King family. 
              It is not easy being the child or widow of a saint. We can hardly 
              expect such people to have anything like a normal sense of propriety 
              and even less to dirty their hands in the unglamorous business of 
              &#147;non-violent social change.&#148;</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">What is more, whites no longer need 
              much help from blacks to promote whatever is meant by &#147;civil 
              rights.&#148; They are past masters at confessing to &#147;racism,&#148; 
              apologizing for their history and culture, and promoting multiracialism 
              and their own dispossession. Why should the King family bother with 
              that sort of thing when whites perform like trained seals already? 
              Far better just to get on with the pleasant business of getting 
              rich.</font></p>

  <font size="3"><p>Every time I read somethng by Mr. Taylor, I can&rsquo;t help but think how wonderful it would be if he were president. He&rsquo;s a thinker, scholar and patriot. But what do we get? Someone like Clinton who has no concern for matters above the belt, and Bush, rich man&rsquo;s son of no personal accomplishmet elected because his opponent was even worse than he was. And speaking of Bush, it should be obvious even to the least informed, the trillions spent on an unnecessary war is bankrupting us finacially and the guest worker scheme will bankrupt us culturally. But in fairness to Bush he has loads of allies. The race traitors, the &#8220;do gooders,&#8221; the catholic church, Hollywood and millions of whites so busy struggling to pay bills and survive they haven&rsquo;t had time to notice the President and their elected reps are simply selling them and their children out, and have been doing so for years. Those who think our country is doing just fine are badly, badly mistaken. It isn&rsquo;t. Most of our leaders have an agenda that has total disregard for the concerns of average, white, middle class Americans. We see the results daily and will see more and more in the future. Wait until the &#8220;guest workers&#8221; start coming. The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>is near third-world status now. But as the saying goes, &#8220;You ain&rsquo;t see nothing yet.&#8221;<br>

Instead, it will be a small matter, like the swatting of a fly. It will be an afterthought, considering the events on the horizon. Nobody will have time for such reflection.<br>
The media bombards us with his &#8220;message of peace&#8221; yet ignores the riots that followed him, which he did not address, which he was powerless to control. <br><br>
He deserves no distinction, that much is clear, and for his hideous &#8220;legacy&#8221; to resort to extortion is sickening and all too predictable. They should buddy up to Mugabe. <br><br>
Many of their kind will drown in the pool created by their fallen idol once it crashes to the earth and is fill by many tears. On that day the rest of us can get back on track with the truth as our weapon, which is what they fear the most.</p></font><p>Posted

I visited the King site mentioned here when I first read this article and I found it to be as shallow as would be expected, from the audio that loads up on the home page of one of King&rsquo;s speeches (which starts out sounding inspirational but quickly becomes tiresome) to the pages long &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221; Policy. As far as the behavior of the King family being analagous to that of the heirs of a rock star, I don&rsquo;t think most rock stars have been elevated to godlike status like King has.</p></font><p>Posted

He&rsquo;s already become the Fourth Person of the Godhead for a large part of &#8220;the black community.&#8221; I&rsquo;m surprised no one is yet whining that his second-place showing in above-mentioned poll is due to racism.</p></font><p>Posted

I don&rsquo;t want them to get beat up at school for stating the truth&hellip; I did tell my daughter the other day When she mentioned Saint <span class="caps">MLK </span>that things are not always what they appear and there is a lot more to the story and I would tell her more as she grew&hellip; but, He was NO saint! Also, My favorite month is approching..Febuary..Black history month&hellip;.Ahhh the lies!! I do correct them on the truths to these lies! <span class="caps">MLK </span>is just different, people feel so passionatly about him&hellip; <br>
 My daughter asked who we were going to pick this year for the annual forced report on a <span class="caps">GREAT </span>black.. I said We will choose someone who is worthy!! Just give me a little time to find someone&hellip;<br><br>

True enough, but did you notice that retailers do not have sales on that holiday?  Could this be part of the reason?<br><br>
