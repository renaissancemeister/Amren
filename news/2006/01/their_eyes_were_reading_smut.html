<div align="left"><i>Nick Chiles, New York Times, Jan. 4, 2006</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Snellville, Ga.&mdash;Last month I happened to go into the Borders Books store at the Stonecrest mall in Lithonia, Ga., about a half-hour from my house here. To my surprise, it had one of the largest collections of books by black authors that I&rsquo;ve ever seen outside an independent black bookstore, rows and rows of bookcases. This is the sort of discovery that makes the pulse quicken, evidence of a population I&rsquo;ve spent most of my professional life seeking: African-American readers. What a thrill to have so much space in a major chain store devoted to this country&rsquo;s black writers. </p>
<p>With an extra spring in my step, I walked into the &ldquo;African-American Literature&rdquo; section &mdash; and what I saw there thoroughly embarrassed and disgusted me. </p>
<p>On shelf after shelf, in bookcase after bookcase, all that I could see was lurid book jackets displaying all forms of brown flesh, usually half-naked and in some erotic pose, often accompanied by guns and other symbols of criminal life. I felt as if I was walking into a pornography shop, except in this case the smut is being produced by and for my people, and it is called &ldquo;literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a black author, I had certainly become familiar with the sexualization and degradation of black fiction. Over the last several years, I had watched the shelves of black bookstores around the country and the tables of street vendors, particularly in New York City, become overrun with novels that seemed to appeal exclusively to our most prurient natures &mdash; as if these nasty books were pairing off back in the stockrooms like little paperback rabbits and churning out even more graphic offspring that make Ralph Ellison books cringe into a dusty corner. </p>
<p>Early last year I walked into a B. Dalton bookstore in a New Jersey mall where the manager had always proudly told me how well my books were selling. This time, I was introduced to a new manager who was just as proud to show me an enhanced black books section teeming with this new black erotica. I&rsquo;ve also noticed much more of this oversexed genre in Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores over the past few months, although it&rsquo;s harder to see there since the chain doesn&rsquo;t appear to have separate black fiction sections. </p>
<p>But up until that visit to Borders in Lithonia, I had thought this mostly a phenomenon of the black retail world, where the black bookstore owners and street vendors say they have to stock what sells, and increasingly what sells are stories that glorify and glamorize black criminals. The genre has been described by different names; &ldquo;ghetto fiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;street lit&rdquo; are two I&rsquo;ve heard most often. Apparently, what we are now seeing is the crossover of this genre to mainstream bookstores. </p>
<p>But the placard above this section of Borders in Lithonia didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Street Lit,&rdquo; it said &ldquo;African-American Literature.&rdquo; We were all represented under that placard, the whole community of black authors &mdash; from me to Terry McMillan and Toni Morrison, from Yolanda Joe and Benilde Little to Edward P. Jones and Kuwana Haulsey &mdash; surrounded and swallowed whole on the shelves by an overwhelming wave of titles and jackets that I wouldn&rsquo;t want my 13-year-old son to see: &ldquo;Hustlin&rsquo; Backwards.&rdquo; &ldquo;Legit Baller.&rdquo; &ldquo;A Hustler&rsquo;s Wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;Chocolate Flava.&rdquo;</p>

But how many works of &#8220;art&#8221; by black &#8220;artists&#8221; focus on subjects other than matters of the groin?  Check out the black music section of any Borders; it&rsquo;s all about sex, being a thug, or missing your baby.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Okay, somebody get this brotha an award for telling of what we as Black parents have to go through every day when we take our kids to the bookstore.  I have three kids who all love books. I think my oldest has read everything from the Lord of the Rings series, King Arthur, the Conan the Barbarian novels (Robert Howard&rsquo;s version), to such books as Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison and the Easy Rawlins series by Walter Mosely, and he just turned 14. That&rsquo;s my boy!!!  And my girls are just as passionate about reading.  That was instilled in them by their Mom and myself, just as my schoolteacher Mother instilled it in me. And yes, I too was thrilled to see more books by Black authors on the shelves&hellip;..until recently.  Street lit has taken over and the covers of these books look like something off the worst videos on <span class="caps">BET. </span> That is <span class="caps">NOT </span>the Black representation I want my kids to see when I take them to the bookstore (or anyone else to see for that matter). I want my kids to be street-smart, but not &ldquo;street&rdquo;! </p>
<p>Yep, I admit it&hellip;I&rsquo;m a &#8220;race man&#8221;. I want the best of African Americans presented to the public, not the worst. I&rsquo;ve been so disgusted with the state of current African American books lately that I&rsquo;ve gone back to re-reading my old Mario Puzo novels.  Current Black authors I do recommend however, are David Anthony Durham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pride of Carthage&rdquo;, detailing Hannibal&rsquo;s battles against Rome (Hannibal was actually able to get African and Celtic warriors to fight together against the Roman legions&hellip;fascinating) and Guy Alexander&rsquo;s &ldquo;Standing at the Scratch Line&rdquo;&hellip;his storylines and writing remind me so much of Puzo. And I like Benilde Little&rsquo;s hilarious books detailing the ways and mores of the snobby &ldquo;Black Bourgeoisie&rdquo;.  And Nick Chiles stuff, the author of the above article, ain&rsquo;t bad. He writes a lot on Black Male-Black Female relationships. None of this interracial dating propaganda from him, Amren readers!</p>
<p>But let me stop before I get carried away&hellip;.I&rsquo;m on the wrong site to be making Black author recommendations!  But funny how a White Nationalist site seems to address issues everyone else is scared to touch&hellip;&hellip;.<br>

  <font size="3"><p>What did you expect from today&rsquo;s publishers? They&rsquo;re just like the rest of the media. They want to keep the Blacks as different from the rest of us as they can. This is all part of the plan to divide and conquer. Keep the cultures different so that they continually clash with each other. Make all Whites believe that all Blacks think about are drugs, booze, crime, and sex. Then when Whites criticize this lifestyle, the Blacks retaliate and then the fun begins.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This must have been a conspiracy by whitey to write these books, claim they are black authors, and insist they be placed in the &#8220;African American Literature&#8221; section.

  <font size="3"><p>   I had a slight acquaintance, some years ago (through a bookstore owner I knew) with a literary agent. I won&rsquo;t give his name, but he wrote a little classic called &#8220;Office Tramp.&#8221;  It took him just three days (I asked him) to produce this little marvel. In its time, it was considered trash, smut.  Probably today it would be very tame (there was no pornography in it). Actually, he wrote it as an exercise or a lesson to show his writers what is wanted in a book that sells.  And sell it did!  He was living very well, I recall.  This, they say, is what the public wants. Actually, I enjoyed the book  a lot &hellip; not because it was risque, but because there was an awful lot of truth in it about office relationships, and who gets ahead, and why. But for three days work, he did very well.</p>
<p>   I see nowadays, when I visit my local branch of the public library, that the place is loaded with novels of this type   &mdash;   the very covers of which would make his book look almost demure. These seem to be aimed exclusively at teenage girls and young women. I suppose the young men want (and find) something more explicit. I hadn&rsquo;t actually noticed any racial breakdown, but I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that these raunchy titles were never formerly what one would expect to find in the public library. Perhaps that is all the librarians can get today&rsquo;s young people to read. Maybe it&rsquo;s felt that at least they&rsquo;re reading <span class="caps">SOMETHING.</span></p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>In my most cynical and self-deprecating bouts of humor, I find myself in near full agreement with Ms. Chiles&rsquo; horror and disgust  at how &ldquo;literature&rdquo; both the black and white &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; varieties, are far too often forms of pornography and not what the are purported to be! </p>
<p>However, I observer that from my point of view, the same can be held true of most: &ldquo;history,&rdquo; &ldquo;magazines,&rdquo; &ldquo;psychology,&rdquo; &ldquo;sociology,&rdquo; and most other book selections at all of the major retail outlets she mentions above. This would be because, there are very few recent magazines, novels, political science, or any other form reading material that I have come into contact with that does not embody and glorify &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; in one way or another. Since I view diversity to be a genocidal perversity, flipping through a magazine and seeing some blond guy hanging off of some Filipino woman in an advertisement; or skimming a novel only to read at some point that the redheaded heroine, or one of her white friends is only sexually charged by a hip-hop Mandingo (normally, in the most gratuitous of manners) is very disquieting to me.</p>
<p>In a perfect world Ms. Chiles, they would segregate African-American literature from erotica and pornography; however, they would also allow for and segregate White Nationalist sensitive materials from all of the other Marxist Diversity filth, that is considered &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; in the world today.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I&rsquo;m a regular reader of American Renaissance. I sometimes agree with the articles and editorials and sometimes disagree. I think any type of racial or religious supremacy is a dangerous ideology. It is true that there is a culture war nowadays. A lot of negative stereotypes about blacks and black life are glorified. I see plenty of non-blacks trying to imitate the &#8220;thug&#8221; life. It is repulsive. I try see the good in all people. Unfortunately the street life and culture is encouraged. The positive aspects of Afro-American culture are neglected or ignored. I truly want a better society where there is less racial hatred and negative stereotypes. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>A second point in mild sympathy with Ms. Chiles, in light of my own anti-multicultural perspectives:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen programs, plays, novels-with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child&rsquo;s spelling book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the Party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers, containing almost nothing except sport, crime, and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even a whole subsection-Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak-engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at.&rdquo; (George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984.)</p>
<p>Somehow it seems that all of the Departments at the Ministry of Truth and Hollywood have gotten all mixed together, right Ms. Chiles? How else would Party information and proletarian mind-candy have gotten so confused?</p>

  <font size="3"><p>A good story is a good story whoever wrote it.  By insisting on reading black authors, blacks have made themselves vulnerable to having this literary sludge foisted onto them.  It reminds me of the &#8220;Hairier Armpits Than Thou&#8221; crowd at <span class="caps">UCSC </span>during my college days, who seemed honestly worried that they weren&rsquo;t reading enough books by lesbian vegetarians.  Why would anyone care what race or sexual orientation an author is?  If what a given author writes makes you happy, does it matter whether that author is a handicapped female albino Tamil or a gay left-handed Eskimo?</p>
<p>Perhaps expecting blacks to churn out masses of good literature is unrealistic; they&rsquo;re not the most literate folks in the world, but the fact that this &#8220;street lit&#8221; fiction is popular suggests that those blacks who are writing professionally know their market.  Where is the black Larry McMurtry?  The black <span class="caps">J.R.R.</span> Tolkein?  The black George <span class="caps">R.R.</span> Martin?  The black Robert Heinlein, Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, David Drake, Larry Bond or Tom Clancy?  This &#8220;street lit&#8221; is the literary equivalent of rap.  The both poison the minds of those who consume them.<br>

The crybaby liberal Atlanta paper once printed an article quoting blacks sniveling that their areas did not contain Borders, Barnes and Nobles or Starbucks, as do white areas; supposedly, black areas are full of thrift stores (nothing wrong with them; my sisters love them) and pawn shops, etc. Even my liberal brother stated this claim was nonsense,as this mall is in a black area and furthermore this store is the only Borders in that county(no Barnes and Noble).</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Just wanted to add a suggestion. Many people are unaware that they do make Christian romance novels and fiction etc. I have a young girl who reads 200 pages a day. One day she will want to read romances. At the christain book store they have a whole  section devoted to young teen girls. The adult and teen romances  have NO sex or touching. They often don&rsquo;t kiss until they are married (and then its a chaste kiss on the lips)! Just a suggestion to those of you who know young ladies. <br>
Also, If I remember correctly, even &#8216;black classics&rsquo; are very sexual..The color purple comes to mind. </p></font><p>Posted

<p>    Alice Walker&rsquo;s literature is pretty shallow compared to similar white authors.  Years ago, Alice Walker was invited to speak at an animal rights convention (because of some story she&rsquo;d written about a horse) and she started talkaing about how she was &#8220;trying&#8221; to become a vegetarian.  We all just sorta looked at each other and asked &#8220;what&rsquo;s to try  &mdash;  you just make your mind up and do it&#8221;.  Most of us were not happy with the choice to have her as a speaker.

(quote from the article)</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve sometimes wished some intrepid scholar would do a sentence and vocabulary study of &ldquo;black&rdquo; books, to determine their academic grade level. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be confused for the works of Joyce or Henry James.&#8221;     &mdash;  - Cassiodorus<br>

<p>   Not being acquainted with this author&rsquo;s name, or what literary masterworks had been missing, I did a search with alibris and amazon to check his &#8220;oeuvre.&#8221;  Now having done so,  I&rsquo;m not so sure he is entitled to adopt such a lofty tone towards the works of others, deploring them for being (of all things!) obsessed with sex.</p>
<p>   For one thing, Mr. Chiles seems to have written no books of his own. He is listed as merely the CO-AUTHOR of a number of books, all of them obsessing on black love, sex, and  what they call nowadays &#8220;relationships&#8221;.  It turns out the primary author is his wife, Denene Miller, and In every case his name is listed <span class="caps">SECOND </span>to hers, and in some cases not even given credit on the cover.  Between them, they have produced such literary gems as: </p>
<p>&#8220;What Brothers Think, What Sistahs Know About Sex: The Real Deal On Passion, Loving, And Intimacy&#8221;,  and &hellip; 		<br>
&#8220;What Brothers Think, What Sistahs Know: The Real Deal on Love and Relationships&#8221;, and &hellip;<br><br>
&#8220;The Sistahs&rsquo; Rules : Secrets For Meeting, Getting, And Keeping A Good Black Man&#8221;,  as well as &hellip;<br><br>
&#8220;Love Don&rsquo;t Live Here Anymore&#8221;</p>
<p>Do we note a similar theme here?  I doubt that Dostoevsky or Dickens (or Joyce or James) will have to worry about their places in the literary hierarchy. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sampling of chapters listed in one of them: <br>
female playa; private freak;  public freak;  fly girls;  Halle Berry;  Lorena Bobbitt;  Spike Lee;  Michael Jordan;  Miss Nice Personality. </p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a sample review carried on amazon:<br>
From Publishers Weekly<br><br>
&#8220;Coauthored by the creator of The Sistah&rsquo;s Rules and her husband, a reporter, this volume offers a fresh, often funny perspective on African-American relationships. Millner and Chiles probe each other&rsquo;s views on dating, sex and marriage in a fast-paced, sassy dialogue that both pokes fun at and illuminates the differences between male and female perspectives on love. </p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with taking the &#8220;slow route to the sheets?&#8221; Millner demands. &#8220;Men,&#8221; retorts Chiles, with a candor that is one of the book&rsquo;s hallmarks, will go &#8220;fast, slow, medium   &mdash;   whatever&rsquo;s necessary to get into the panties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some chapters address specifically issues of African-American relationships. One deals with the appeal of white women to the black &#8220;brother,&#8221; for example, while another ponders why so many black women seem angry to black men.&#8221; </p>
<p>	<br>
Nuff said? I suspect that his books would have fit right into place in that bookstore. Perhaps he just resented the competition.<br><br>

  <font size="3"><p>By contrast, I&rsquo;ve been reading &#8220;The Rules of the Game:  Jutland and the British Naval Command&#8221;, by Andrew Gordon.  My last book was &#8220;Jutland&#8221;, by John Campbell.  They&rsquo;re each better than Marder&rsquo;s book on the subject, and compliment each other well.  While Campbell describes almost every last large-caliber shell hit in both fleets except for <span class="caps">HMS</span> Black Prince and <span class="caps">HMS</span> Defense, which each went down with all hands (Defense after a magazine explosion that was heard and felt by every man in both fleets,) Gordon discusses at length the personalities involved and their probable reasons for making the decisions they made during the battle.  The book before those was &#8220;The development of a Modern Navy:  French Naval Policy 1871-1904.&#8221;  There has been no profanity and no sexuality discussed in these books, though I gather that British First Lord of the Admiralty Fisher and <span class="caps">BCF</span> Admiral David Beatty were unfaithful to their wives.  There has likewise been no description of criminal behavior in these books, except perhaps for the irresponsible German use of predreadnought battleships and the British use of equally ancient armored cruisers in the Jutland battle, with disasterous consequences; three of these blew up and sank with all hands, killing 844 Germans in &#8220;Pommern&#8221; and 1760 Britons in &#8220;Black Prince&#8221; and &#8220;Defense.&#8221;</p>
<p>A human brain is a lot like a pot of soup.  What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.  More books and less television would be a good start for anyone.  After one is in the habit of reading, better books are a must.<br>

<p>Well, that all depends on your point of view now doesn&rsquo;t it Comrade Ellis?</p>
<p>First off, who said anything about &ldquo;White supremacist literature&rdquo; reread what I wrote? When I speak of &ldquo;White Nationalist sensitive materials&rdquo; I am merely speaking of any form of literature that does not include race mixing and other pernicious facets of Marxist multiculturalism. A good example would be George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984!</p>
<p>Second, the cultural trend in &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; literature and other mediums that focuses on the debased and odd, is a direct outgrowth of  the so-called avant-garde penchants of the radical hippie 60s freaks. They have continued to attempt to pass off the profane and wretched as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for quite sometime now.</p>
<p>Third and last, that multiculturalism has in many respects become synonymous with this twisted take on life is no coincidence. The 60s&rsquo; counterculture was merely the Marxist infant that grew up into the raging Marxist adult called multiculturalism. Hence, films that feature black hero pimps that inspire hope and love in their white prostitutes and &ldquo;normal&rdquo; gay cowboys who do likewise!</p>

<p>Besides the fact that many blacks just don&rsquo;t see books as a black thing, white authors don&rsquo;t have to continually &#8220;write white.&#8221;  They are not constrained by the cultural crabpot that blacks are   &mdash;   the constant self-conscious question of &#8220;Am I black enough?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Not all &#8220;white&#8221; literature is literary.  It spans the entire range.  Although I understand the author&rsquo;s frustration, he should realize this is part of a free market and reflects the fact that this means more blacks are writing books.  It&rsquo;s actually a good thing.  You don&rsquo;t have to be a James Baldwin to get published anymore.</p>
<p>Also, whites don&rsquo;t limit themselves to writing for any particular racial audience.  Many black authors specifically target the black population, as if a black finance advisor can only give qualified advice to black readers.  That automatically limits their sales, too.  </p>
<p>I think when black authors are freed from having to be &#8220;authentically black&#8221; before all else, they&rsquo;ll be able to explore the human condition in its wondrous depth and complexity.<br>
And maybe even write science fiction&hellip;as well as the trashy stuff, which always finds an audience.</p>

Yes, this is a place for true dialogue about race. There&rsquo;s a reason &#8220;everyone else is scared to touch&#8221; these issues:  white people aren&rsquo;t allowed to discuss them.</p>
<p>Most &#8220;Dialogues on Race&#8221; are carefully scripted propaganda, and if you&rsquo;re white, you better shut up if your thoughts diverge even slightly from the script.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>The simple fact is this. Most publishing houses are white owned and therefore, they dictate what they will pay authors for. It is evident in the music world why artist are paid to produce what they produce. Upstart black authors, in order to get thier name in print, just might be &#8220;encouraged&#8221; to print such smut. The other part of the problem is that people buy the garbage. Hey Chiles, put it this way my brotha&rsquo;, there is white garbage out there as well. These books are to the new literary world as blackplotation films were to the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. Nothing has really changed in America. We are fools to think it has. The minstrel show goes on. I don&rsquo;t read that garbage. Ralph Wiley, Cornell West, Toni Morrisson and others are the real black voices in print. Nathan McCall has put out some good stuff, also. Street lit and Romance novels; They both are a waste of a good tree, even if printed on recycled paper! </p></font><p>Posted
