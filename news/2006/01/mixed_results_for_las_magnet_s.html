			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandy Banks, Los Angeles Times, Jan. 20, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By day&rsquo;s end, the parents of more than 60,000 children will have made their pitch to get into a magnet school, and Los Angeles Unified School District officials will begin sorting the requests by interest, by grade and, most important, by race.</p>
<p>Only one in four students will be accepted. Others will be left wondering if they have been unfairly left on the sidelines by a 30-year-old process created for a district that no longer exists.</p>
<p>The schools were supposed to be magnets for educational excellence, attracting motivated students to integrated campuses outside of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But as a tool for integration today, most magnets fail. Eighty-seven of the district&rsquo;s 162 magnets are virtually all black or Latino, and almost all of those considered integrated &mdash; those with 30% white students &mdash; are in or near the San Fernando Valley or the Westside.</p>
<p>As the new head of the district&rsquo;s magnet program, Sharon Curry knows that magnets were intended to integrate schools.</p>
<p>But as the former principal of a Mid-City magnet that she says tried and failed to attract middle-class whites, she also knows how difficult it can be to integrate a campus.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Curry helped remake Crescent Heights Elementary into a language arts magnet with a social justice bent. With a new curriculum and a hand-picked staff, Crescent Heights improved its test scores, became a California Distinguished School and last year generated six applications for every open slot.</p>
<p>Yet the school&rsquo;s demographics haven&rsquo;t budged. Despite the fact that it draws from a neighborhood where most of the residents are white, Crescent Heights has only three white children among its 350 students. Almost all the rest are black or Latino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a big campaign to get excellent teachers, our scores went up, people began taking a look at the school,&rdquo; Curry recalled. &ldquo;But white parents would come and see all these African American children and say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want my child to be the only white child in the school.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
<p>Her struggle illustrates both the promise and the problems of the magnet school system. Once a nationwide example of successful integration, the quota-driven magnet program may be on its way to becoming an anachronism.</p>
<p>Begun with four schools in 1976, the magnet network was part of a court-ordered desegregation plan that relied heavily on mandatory busing, which was bitterly opposed by many parents. When the busing program ended three years later, the magnet network rapidly expanded &mdash; fed by a stream of state and federal desegregation funds.</p>
