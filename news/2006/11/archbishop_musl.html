<h1>Archbishop: Muslim Women Shouldn&rsquo;t Wear Veils In Public</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>thisislondon.co.uk, Nov. 13, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the Church of England&rsquo;s most senior figures today risks a row with the Muslim community by suggesting that Islamic women should not wear veils in public.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Mail, Dr John Sentamu warns that &lsquo;no minority&rsquo; should impose its beliefs on the rest of society and that the veil causes Muslim women to &lsquo;stick out&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of York &mdash; who ranks second in the Church&rsquo;s hierarchy &mdash; also says the BBC is biased against Christians because Anglicans don&rsquo;t threaten to &lsquo;bomb&rsquo; the corporation.</p>
<p>And in a strongly-worded analysis of the state of modern Britain, the Uganda-born cleric makes a passionate defence of the Queen, family values and faith schools.</p>
<p>The Archbishop&rsquo;s comments on veils follow Jack Straw&rsquo;s revelation that he asks Muslim women to remove their niqabs before speaking to him at his constituency surgery.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu said: &lsquo;Muslim scholars would say three questions: 1. Does it conform to norms of decency? 2. Does it render you more secure? 3. What kind of Islam are you projecting by wearing it?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think in the British context it renders you less secure because you stick out and it brings unwelcome attention. On the first question, I don&rsquo;t think it does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His views put him at odds with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams who has said it would be &lsquo; politically dangerous&rsquo; if society did not allow visible signs of faith.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu goes on to reveal that he removes his cross when he visits Mosques. &lsquo;I am going into someone else&rsquo;s home,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;And I can&rsquo;t simply say: &#8220;Take me as I am whether you like it or not&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His attack on the BBC reflects growing unease over the corporation&rsquo;s pro-Muslim agenda. Dr Sentamu said: &lsquo;We get more knocks, they can do to us what they dare not do to the Muslims. We are fair game because they can get away with it. We don&rsquo;t go down there and say we are going to bomb your place. It is not within our nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He also launches a strong defence of faith schools and rejects Government attempts to impose quotas.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu warns that materialism is destroying family life and urges a return to Victorian family values. &lsquo;We have become a society where we all gather round the microwaves, or the television. Even while you are eating, the television is blaring.&rsquo; He also calls on people to take more pride in Britain. &lsquo;When I was in Uganda, everything that was British was best. If you went to a shop to buy a ruler, you looked for one that said &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221;. But now this country disbelieves in itself in an amazing way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Launching a defence of the monarchy, he says: &lsquo;The Church of England reminds the nation that in this country the Queen is the defender of the faith, the head of the Commonwealth and the head of state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop also calls for more restraint at Christmas. &lsquo;I would suggest this Advent eating less and not spending so much.&rsquo;</p>
