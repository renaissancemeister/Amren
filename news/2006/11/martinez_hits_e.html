<h1><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20061114-114127-8953r.htm">Martinez Hits &lsquo;Enforcement Only&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan and Ralph Z. Hallow, Washington Times, Nov. 15, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. Mel Martinez, President Bush&rsquo;s choice to become chairman of the Republican National Committee, said his goal will be to undo the election damage done by the border-enforcement-first message of most Republicans &mdash; which he called &#8220;harshness only.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Martinez&rsquo;s nomination &mdash; which must be approved by the RNC at its January meeting &mdash; is Mr. Bush&rsquo;s first major political step since last week&rsquo;s elections, and it is already creating division among rank-and-file Republicans, who say it puts the party on the wrong side of the immigration issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after the Oval Office announcement, Mr. Martinez said he was &#8220;not going to do a post-mortem on the election here today.&#8221; Moments later, though, he did a post-mortem on immigration, saying he saw a clear message on that issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have to understand that the election did speak to one issue, and that was that &mdash; it&rsquo;s not about bashing people, it&rsquo;s about presenting a hopeful face,&#8221; said Mr. Martinez, who won his seat in 2004.</p>
<p>He was one of the authors of the Senate compromise that would have allowed most illegal aliens to remain in the United States and pay small fines in return for a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Border security only, enforcement only, harshness only is not the message that I believe America wants to convey,&#8221; Mr. Martinez said.</p>
<p>His proposal passed the Senate, though a majority of Republicans voted against it. The House, however, passed an enforcement-first strategy. Even the RNC voted unanimously in August to adopt a resolution calling for border and interior enforcement, and Mr. Pullen said Mr. Martinez as chairman would run contrary to that message.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Buddy Witherspoon, an RNC member from Columbia, S.C., said a black conservative such as Mr. Steele would have been an &#8220;excellent choice.&#8221; But Dr. Witherspoon, who is white, worried just how much Mr. Steele, Mr. Martinez or anyone whom &#8220;Karl Rove chooses&#8221; will be able to speak for the future of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>As Mr. Bush pushes the RNC in his direction on immigration, House Republicans move the other way, with Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, a contender for the House minority leader&rsquo;s post, saying yesterday that he will oppose Mr. Bush&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is coming at us now is going to be a massive amnesty bill that will likely be propounded not only by Democrats in the House and Senate, but frankly also by the White House,&#8221; he said in an interview with radio host Laura Ingraham.</p>
