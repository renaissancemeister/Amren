<h1>Racism and Race Crime Redefined</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Easton, BBC News, Nov. 8, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racism was once defined as &ldquo;prejudice plus power&rdquo; &mdash; a definition which, in a British context, has tended to exclude all but the white population. </p>
<p>However, the &ldquo;racist murders&rdquo; of Kriss Donald in Glasgow in 2004 and Ross Parker in Peterborough in 2001, young white men killed by Asians, demonstrate how society has been forced to redefine racism. </p>
<p>It was, of course, the murder of a young black man, Stephen Lawrence, which changed the debate about race crime in Britain. </p>
<p>The inquiry which followed redefined a racist incident as any &ldquo;which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person&rdquo;. It is, therefore, a largely subjective crime &mdash; and one which has proved extremely difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>The statistics reflect that subjectivity, but they also reflect a belief right across the spectrum in multicultural Britain, that people are attacked because of the colour of their skin. </p>
<p>Changing picture </p>
<p>Until the mid-nineties, the government&rsquo;s British Crime Survey only asked ethnic minority groups whether they had been the victim of a crime which was racially motivated. Since then, all victims are asked and the picture has changed dramatically. </p>
<p>The most recent analysis shows that in 2004, 87,000 people from black or minority ethnic communities (BME) said they had been a victim of a racially motivated crime. In the same period, 92,000 white people said they had also fallen victim. </p>
<p>Focusing on violent racial attacks, 49,000 BME were victims. Among whites, the number was 77,000. </p>
<p>Of those that involved wounding 4,000 were BME. Among the white population it was 20,000. </p>
<p>The numbers can be highly misleading, though. Since about 90% of people in Britain are white, the statistics actually show the risk of being a victim of race crime is significantly greater if you are from an ethnic minority. </p>
<p>According to the most recent Home Office analysis, the chances for a white person is less than 1%. For Black and Asian people it is put at about 1%. </p>
<p>Low risk </p>
<p>Taking into account the subjective nature of the statistics, it seems that the risks are relatively low across all communities. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, for the tens of thousands of white people affected by race crime, the issue is a real one. </p>
<p>The far right has tried to exploit what it claims is the untold story of racial attacks on white people. On the National Front website they feature a long list of &ldquo;The Fallen&rdquo;, white people they say were killed by non-whites. </p>
<p>Often, however, the crimes have nothing to do with race and in a number of cases, for instance Ross Parker, relatives of the victims have objected to their names being used. </p>
<p>Trying to unravel the motivation behind a crime is always difficult. Was a kick or a punch in a violent robbery any harder because of the victim&rsquo;s skin colour? </p>
<p>Describing an incident as racist may say as much about a victim&rsquo;s mindset as the offender. How else can one explain the British Crime Survey finding that 3,100 car thefts from Asians were deemed to be racially motivated? </p>
<p>Most of the offenders (57%) in the racially motivated crimes identified in the British Crime Survey are not white. White victims said 82% of offenders were not white. </p>
<p>Among black victims of race crime, a quarter of offenders were identified as not white. Among Asian victims, the non-white proportion rises to a third. </p>
<p>There has been in increase in recorded instances of race crime, but experts believe this is due to more people coming forward to report incidents and a greater willingness from the police to take accusations seriously. </p>
<p>The British Crime Survey tells a different story. The most recent figures suggest the incidence of race crime is falling &mdash; a drop of 13% year on year. </p>
<p>Amid this soup of subjective and contradictory statistics, what is clear is that race crime is no longer a black and white issue. It is as complex and multifaceted as the communities in which it occurs. </p>
<p>In the Lozells district of Birmingham last year, tensions defined around race exploded into violence. Asian gangs and black gangs clashed in what have been described as &ldquo;race riots&rdquo;. But, in reality, the disturbances were about poverty, housing and fear. </p>
<p>Racism, prejudice and bigotry are not defined by the colour of someone&rsquo;s skin.<br>
