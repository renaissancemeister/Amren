				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yvonne M. Wenger, Post and Courier (Charleston), Nov. 7, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deanna Bernstein of Summerville wanted to spend a night at the Coastal Carolina Fair eating the food and enjoying the rides and playing the games. Instead, she ended up in jail.</p>
<p>When Bernstein passed a vendor selling a T-shirt Wednesday with Confederate flags and the words &ldquo;Confederately Correct Civil Rights for Southern Whites,&rdquo; her stomach turned.</p>
<p>Bernstein said the T-shirt promotes racism. In fighting to have it removed, she was charged with trespassing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people don&rsquo;t like it, then complain, use your voice,&rdquo; said Bernstein, 38, a California native who is white.</p>
<p>She asked the vendor to remove the shirt and complained to fair management. When the T-shirt wasn&rsquo;t put away, a friend bought one for Bernstein and she stood outside the fair gates with the T-shirt in hand to ask people coming in what they thought about it.</p>
<p>In the 10 minutes Bernstein said she stood there, she said most people were complacent about it but some who passed her said they liked the shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I see is the adults are perpetuating all of this,&rdquo; Bernstein said. &ldquo;These children are going by and they see the T-shirt and they think hatred is OK. How could anything change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charleston County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies asked Bernstein to leave. When she didn&rsquo;t, she was arrested on a trespassing charge and fined $440, and she said she spent about eight hours in the county detention center.</p>
<p>Bernstein said she was confused by the arrest because she had paid admission and was not disruptive.</p>
<p>Chip Boling, president of the Coastal Carolina Fair, said Bernstein was well-mannered, but he said she was asked six times to leave for violating the fair&rsquo;s policy against expressing political views on the private property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason she was arrested was because she refused to leave the grounds,&rdquo; Boling said. &ldquo;She was advised she was trespassing. It was an unfortunate thing, but it was her choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Likewise, Boling said fair security asked people distributing campaign literature to leave the grounds throughout the 10-day fair that ended Saturday. He said in his 20 years with the fair, he knows of no other similar arrests. Boling said the fair respects individuals&rsquo; rights to personal beliefs and would not take a position on the T-shirt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bernstein said she did not believe the vendor had the right to sell the shirts, because she said it was offensive and inappropriate for children to see. &ldquo;The more people generalize, the more people hate, the more divided the cultures are going to be,&rdquo; said Bernstein, who moved from Los Angeles nine weeks ago. &ldquo;It is so ugly here in the South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernstein said she does not have a record of protesting but felt it was her duty to speak up about the T-shirt for her 15-month-old son. &ldquo;I am raising a child and what kind of mother would I be if I didn&rsquo;t fight to change something as gross as this?&rdquo; Bernstein said.</p>
<p>After seeing what she perceives as racism in the area, Bernstein said she plans to move as soon as she can afford it. She wants the fair&rsquo;s management to apologize and drop the charge. She also wants the managers to provide fair staff with diversity training and have a booth at next year&rsquo;s fair that promotes multiculturalism. She said she contacted all the fair&rsquo;s sponsors to ask them to consider the situation when giving future support.</p>
<p>Boling said he does not know why the fair should apologize. &ldquo;We tried not to send her to jail,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The fair&rsquo;s objective is to retain a family-friendly atmosphere that improves the community by providing donations to organizations throughout the Lowcountry for program costs, Boling said.<br>
