<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>China obtained secret stealth technology used on B-2 bomber engines from a Hawaii-based spy ring in a compromise U.S. officials say will allow Beijing to copy or counter a key weapon in the Pentagon&rsquo;s new strategy against China.</p>
<p>Details of the classified defense technology related to the B-2&rsquo;s engine exhaust system and its ability to avoid detection by infrared sensors were sold to Chinese officials by former defense contractor Noshir S. Gowadia, an Indian-born citizen charged with spying in a federal indictment released by prosecutors in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mr. Gowadia provided extensive technical assistance to Chinese weapons designers in developing a cruise missile with an engine exhaust system that is hard to detect by radar, according to court papers made public recently.</p>
<p>He also helped the Chinese modify a cruise missile so that it can intercept U.S. air-to-air missiles, and helped Chinese weapons designers improve testing and measurement facilities, the court papers state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Additionally, the court papers indicated that Mr. Gowadia sent e-mails to Israel, Germany, and Switzerland in 2002 and 2004 that contained data labeled &#8220;secret&#8221; and &#8220;top secret&#8221; that was related to U.S. stealth technology intended for use in the TH-98 Eurocopter and for foreign commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>One computer file found in Mr. Gowadia&rsquo;s Maui, Hawaii, home was a file containing the radar cross-sections of U.S. B-1 and F-15 jets and the Air Force&rsquo;s air-launched cruise missile, information that would be useful to countering those systems by anti-aircraft missiles or other air defense weapons.</p>
<p>The case is the second major military technology espionage case involving China. Earlier this year, two Chinese-born brothers in Los Angeles were arrested as suspects in passing Navy warship and submarine weapons secrets to China.</p>
<p>In all, Mr. Gowadia is charged with making at least six secret visits to China from 2002 through 2005, and being paid at least $110,000 by Chinese officials for highly classified defense technology supplied through January, according to court papers. Investigators think he was paid as much as $2 million, some of which remains in foreign bank accounts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Gowadia worked for B-2 developer and manufacturer Northrop Aircraft Inc. from 1968 to 1989 as part of an ultrasecret special access program for the B-2, and later as a Northrop contractor involved in classified research on missiles and aircraft. He also worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1990s.</p>
<p>He developed the still-secret method used by military aircraft to suppress infrared signals from the engine that blocks heat-seeking missiles from targeting the jet.</p>
<p>U.S. officials familiar with the case said the compromise of the B-2 technology is extremely damaging because it will give China key secrets on the bomber.</p>
<p>A defense official said the case highlights China&rsquo;s intelligence efforts to counter key weapons systems that give the United States strategic advantages over Chinese forces. &#8220;The B-2 is at the head of the list of their intelligence targets,&#8221; said the official.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>B-2 bombers are regularly deployed for short periods of time on Guam as part of what the Pentagon is calling its &#8220;hedge&#8221; strategy to be ready to deal with a Chinese threat in the future.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Mr. Gowadia, who lives on an estate on the island of Maui, conspired with two men, Tommy Wong and Henri Nyo, to sell the technology.</p>
<p>Mr. Wong was identified in court papers as an official of the Chinese Foreign Experts Bureau who met the other men during meetings in Chengdu, China. The bureau is a center that conducts &#8220;research and development of Chinese fighter aircraft and cruise missiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the six visits, Mr. Gowadia was there &#8220;for the specific purpose of assisting the [People&rsquo;s Republic of China] in designing, testing and analyzing a low observable exhaust nozzle &hellip; for a PRC cruise missile,&#8221; the indictment said.</p>
<p>In the earlier indictment, Mr. Gowadia was quoted as telling investigators that he &#8220;disclosed classified information and material both verbally and in papers, computer presentations, letters and other methods to individuals in foreign countries with the knowledge that information was classified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason I disclosed this classified information was to establish the technological credibility with the potential customers for future business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to help these countries to further their self aircraft protection systems. My personal gain would be business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Gowadia has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his son, Ashton Gowadia, told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin that the charges against his father are false. A trial is scheduled for July.</p>
