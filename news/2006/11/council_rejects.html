<p>The room was filled and tensions were high last Tuesday, Nov 14, at the Town Council meeting.</p>
<p>More than 15 town residents stood to address the Council about their concerns on the issue that has been plaguing the town for months, illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Led by Councilman Steve Jenkins, whose recent initiatives regarding the issue have been repeatedly rejected, a number of citizens spoke in support of the Councilman&rsquo;s newest proposal to create an illegal immigration task force and demanded the town do more.</p>
<p>Jerry Beckett, a town resident and frequent speaker at the meetings, started the heated debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only are they illegal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they have the gall to be marching the streets of America under the Mexican flag and make demands for services that they have no rights to.&#8221; He then suggested that the Council establish English as the official language of Culpeper.</p>
<p>Beckett&rsquo;s speech was followed by a round of applause and Mayor Pranas Rimeikis urged the crowd to control emotional outbursts.</p>
<p>Continuing the debate, Keith Price, a town resident, spoke and urged the council to put in place Jenkins&rsquo; task force to examine the impact of immigration on the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is appropriate and necessary for Council to propose a solution for the good of the community from local evidence. The task force will find the problems and help determine the actions that we need to take,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Clatterbuck, on the other hand, thanked Jenkins for his initiative with the immigration issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is the only one that has addressed this problem. And I resent the implications that this is a racist issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>His statement was followed by another outburst from the meeting&rsquo;s crowd.</p>
<p>Standing up as one of the only Hispanic faces in a sea of concerned and angry white faces, Ricardo Juarez addressed the immigration issue next.</p>
<p>Juarez is representative from Mexicanos Sin Fronteras or Mexicans Without Borders, a non-profit organization dedicated to defend and promote human rights for Latino immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We support the idea of a task force, we think it is a great idea,&#8221; he said. He urged the Council to consider this idea because the town needs &#8220;humanistic resolutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jenkins&rsquo; motion was seconded by Councilman Chris Snider and then discussed by the council.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have heard from the citizens, we have heard constantly from the citizens,&#8221; said Jenkins, addressing the fact that the Council has not agreed with his past initiatives. &#8220;This is almost like trying to put out a brush fire by blowing on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Council rejected Jenkins&rsquo; motion by a vote of 6-2, and decided to follow the recommendation of the mayor and discuss the issue at another meeting, which has not been set.</p>
