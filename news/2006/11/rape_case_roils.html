<h1><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2671141">Rape Case Roils Saudi Legal System</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donna Abu-Nasr, AP, Nov. 21, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the teenager went to the police a few months ago to report she was gang-raped by seven men, she never imagined the judge would punish her and that she would be sentenced to more lashes than one of her alleged rapists received. </p>
<p>The story of the Girl of Qatif, as the alleged rape victim has been called by the media here, has triggered a rare debate about Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s legal system, in which judges have wide discretion in punishing a criminal, rules of evidence are shaky and sometimes no defense lawyers are present.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the case of the Girl of Qatif, she was sentenced to 90 lashes for being alone in a car with a man to whom she was not married a crime in this strictly segregated country at the time that she was allegedly attacked and raped by a group of other men.</p>
<p>In the sleepy, Shiite village of al-Awwamiya on the outskirts of the eastern city of Qatif, the 19-year-old is struggling to forget the spring night that changed her life. An Associated Press reporter met her in a face-to-face interview. She spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her privacy; the AP does not identify rape victims unless they ask to be named.</p>
<p>Her hands tremble, her dark brown eyes are lifeless. Her sleep is interrupted by a replay of the events, which she describes in a barely audible whisper.</p>
<p>That night, she said, she had left home to retrieve her picture from a male high school student she used to know. She had just been married but had not moved in with her husband and did not want her picture to remain with the student.</p>
<p>While the woman was in the car with the student, she said, two men intercepted them, got into the vehicle and drove the couple to a secluded area where the two were separated. She said she was raped by seven men, three of whom also allegedly raped her friend.</p>
<p>In a trial that ended in November in which the prosecutor asked for the death penalty for the seven men four of the men received between one and five years in prison plus 80 to 1,000 lashes, said the woman. Three others are awaiting sentencing. Neither the defendants nor the plaintiffs retained lawyers, as is common here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big shock came when the judge sentenced me and the man to 90 lashes each,&#8221; said the woman. The sentence was handed down as part of the rape trial. Lashes are usually spread over several days, dealt around 50 at a time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice in Saudi Arabia is administered by a system of religious courts according to the kingdom&rsquo;s strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. Judges appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council have complete discretion to set sentences, except in cases where Sharia outlines a punishment, such as capital crimes.</p>
<p>That means no two judges would likely hand down the same verdict for similar crimes. A rapist, for instance, could receive anywhere from a light or no sentence to death, depending on the judge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The broad discretion judges enjoy have been a disaster for Fatima, another Saudi woman. She suddenly found herself divorced from her husband, Mansour al-Timani, after her half-brothers went to a judge and told him their sister had married beneath her.</p>
<p>Fatima, whose full name has not been given in media reports, had been married for over three years and was pregnant with her second child when the judge declared the marriage void in July 2005.</p>
<p>Today, Fatima sits in jail with her 11-month-old son her 4-year-old daughter was recently freed rather than return to the custody of her family as the judge decreed.</p>
<p>The problems over sentencing are exacerbated by loose trial rules, in which physical evidence sometimes is not presented.</p>
<p>The Girl of Qatif said her trial had two sessions. The three trial judges asked for her statement, then heard the statement from the seven defendants in the first court session, according to the woman. In the second, about a month later, the judges pronounced their verdict. It was not known if there were other sessions she did not attend.</p>
<p>Judges in the case referred The Associated Press to the Justice Ministry when asked about the sentencing. The ministry, in a statement Tuesday, said rape could not be proved. There were no witnesses and the men had recanted confessions they made during interrogation, the statement said. It said the verdict cannot be appealed.</p>
<p>Sharia allows defendants to deny signed confessions, according to Abdul-Aziz al-Gassem, a lawyer who was not involved in the case. They still get punished if convicted, but the verdict is lighter.</p>
