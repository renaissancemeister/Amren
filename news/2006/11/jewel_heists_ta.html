<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Abdul Rasheed Khalid was alone in his Brampton jewellery store filling the display cases with yellow gold rings and necklaces when two people, one wearing a head-to-toe black burqa, appeared outside his locked door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salamu alaikum,&#8221; the 58-year-old store owner said after pushing the entry buzzer, believing them to be a Muslim couple. There was no reply, and seconds later the pair &mdash; both males &mdash; forced him at gunpoint to the back office where he was bound with duct tape and hit several times. Then his store was cleaned out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, keep quiet, close your eyes,&#8221; they said, while emptying the red velvet trays into duffel bags carried by an accomplice. Khalid caught a glimpse of the crooks. He thinks they were Pakistani or Indian.</p>
<p>Last Friday&rsquo;s daylight robbery has other South Asian jewellers across the GTA on edge, fearful they&rsquo;ll be next. The thieves didn&rsquo;t seem to care that Zaibi Jewellers is in the same strip mall as a storefront Peel Region police station at McLaughlin Rd. and Ray Lawson Blvd.</p>
<p>That unease is reflected by police, who say that robberies are up overall in Peel but there has been a particular spike in the number of South Asian jewellery heists. Det. Sgt. Bruce Chapman, who runs the Peel force&rsquo;s central robbery unit, said police are &#8220;doing everything we can to solve each and every one&#8221; of the robberies. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bad that robbers, brazenly posing as police officers, hit two other stores last month, prompting Peel police to form a task force.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re all scared now,&#8221; said Abdul Gheffar Shehzad, who provides jewellers with their wares. He and others from the industry gathered in Khalid&rsquo;s now-closed shop yesterday. They sat amid the empty glass displays behind a door that will be closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Citing several reasons, they say they are worried they are being targeted by well-organized bandits, possibly with ties to gangs. It&rsquo;s not known how many businesses have been robbed, but the jewellers said at least a half-dozen retailers across the GTA have been victimized, including several businesses in Toronto&rsquo;s Gerrard St. India Bazaar.</p>
<p>The owners believe Indian jewellery stores are easy prey because they are often found in outdoor malls without security guards and with wide-open parking lots that allow criminals to make a swift getaway.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to something like a diamond jewellery store, Peoples&rsquo; Jewellers for example, they&rsquo;re located inside large malls and it&rsquo;s obviously much harder to attack them versus something outside,&#8221; said Imran Ahmad, Khalid&rsquo;s son-in-law.</p>
<p>Ahmad also points the finger at disaffected South Asian youth who have inside knowledge about the business dealings of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to make a quick buck is very attractive to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The first generation that came here are working hard while the second generation, partially, are coming into the crime scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakhar Jhuty said he closed shop about a year ago because he was &#8220;fed up&#8221; with the robberies and figured it was a matter of time before he got hit again. He was robbed four years ago, but the thugs got away with little.</p>
<p>At Nu Deep jewellers on Gore Rd. in Brampton, two suspects in police uniforms buzzed to get into the shop. The man-woman team handcuffed the victim and told him he was under arrest. The victim was beaten with a pistol, taken to the bathroom and tied up. The thieves stole jewellery and cash.</p>
<p>A year earlier, a 45-year-old woman was working at the Dhesi Jewelers on Airport Rd. when two people &mdash; one wearing a police uniform &mdash; sounded the front buzzer. They said they were conducting a police investigation before forcing her to the basement. When she came up, she discovered her store had been ransacked.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, three people were arrested for both robberies.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s small comfort to the jewellers who are not convinced police are doing enough to catch the criminals and recover their jewellery. Khalid estimates he has lost $1 million and doesn&rsquo;t have insurance because it&rsquo;s difficult to get coverage in his type of business.</p>
<p>His son-in-law says, if police can&rsquo;t crack a case quickly, thieves are &#8220;going to melt all the gold into something that unrecognizable and sell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, some jewellers have taken to varying their hours to throw off would-be thieves conducting surveillance.</p>
