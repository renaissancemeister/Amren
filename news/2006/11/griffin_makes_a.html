<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2432203_1,00.html">Griffin Makes Anti-Islam Speech Outside Race Hate Trial</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Norfolk, Times (UK), November 1, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The leader of the British National Party denounced Islam as &ldquo;a vicious and wicked faith&rdquo; today as he went on trial accused of trying to incite racial hatred.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin clutched a cross and compared himself to fallen World War Two soldiers as he pledged that he, like them, was willing to die to keep the country &ldquo;free, Christian and British&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His speech was made with a megaphone to more than 500 cheering supporters of the far-right party outside Leeds Crown Court shortly after a jury was sworn in for the trial of Mr Griffin, 47, and another senior BNP member, 26-year-old Mark Collett. Each denies conduct which was intended or likely to stir up racial hatred.</p>
<p>The charges &mdash; two against Mr Griffin and four against Mr Collett &mdash; are linked to speeches made by the two men to BNP supporters in the run-up to the 2004 local elections.</p>
<p>A large-scale security operation involving more than 80 uniformed police officers was launched to separate rival groups of demonstrators at the court.</p>
<p>The BNP supporters, many holding Union or St George flags and others with &ldquo;Defend Free Speech&rdquo; banners, were held behind one set of crash barriers, 20 yards from a pen holding a smaller group of protestors from the left-wing coalition group Leeds United Against Fascism.</p>
<p>Scuffles broke out and one man was knocked to ground as Mr Griffin arrived at the court, surrounded by a group of burly henchmen dressed in dark suits and black gloves.</p>
<p>The two men sat in the dock &mdash; where Mr Griffin had a laptop computer and a display of cards from well-wishers &mdash; as an all-white jury of five men and seven women was sworn in.</p>
<p>The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Norman Jones, QC, had earlier told the jury panel that the case would deal with &ldquo;strong criticism in speeches of the Muslim religion and issues of racism, together with criticism of elements of the present Government&rsquo;s policy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He warned them that such issues &ldquo;can raise conflicts in people&rsquo;s minds&rdquo; and invited them to &ldquo;search your conscience&rdquo; to decide whether they would be able to approach the case &ldquo;without prejudice and without bias&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The judge also referred to the crowds outside the entrance to the court and told the jury that &ldquo;you must not in any way let that influence you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people outside this court today who are demonstrating in relationship to this case and are handing out leaflets,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If any of you have taken a leaflet would you please destroy it and do not take any for the remainder of this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening of the case was adjourned until Friday.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin and Mr Collett, both wearing red poppies in their suit lapels, later emerged on the courtroom steps to be greeted by loud cheers from their supporters and a hail of verbal abuse from the anti-fascists.</p>
<p>The BNP leader claimed that he and Mr Collett were victims of a Labour &ldquo;show trial&rdquo; and thanked his supporters for turning out in such numbers to support &ldquo;the rights of the British people to free speech in this country&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said the decision to prosecute him, which was made public a day after Labour called the 2005 general election, had been taken by a Government which was &ldquo;desperate to claw back the Muslim vote that they&rsquo;d lost through their illegal and appalling war in Iraq&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Holding aloft a copy of the Koran, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve studied this. Tony Blair says this is a religion of peace. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a manual for conquering other people&rsquo;s countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin, a broad smile fixed permanently to his face, said the anti-BNP demonstration was being staged by &ldquo;people who want to see the black flag of Islam flying over this country because they failed to get the red flag of communism&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He pointed to his poppy and spoke of the sacrifice made by countless soldiers who fought against the Kaiser and against Hitler to preserve British values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like the young men symbolised by these poppies, if necessary we will die for that same freedom of speech. That&rsquo;s what being British is all about,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As Mr Griffin was guided by his minders towards a waiting fleet of black vehicles which drove him from the court, football-style taunts broke out between the rival groups.</p>
<p>The anti-fascist crowd chanted: &ldquo;Hitler - Never Again! Auschwitz &mdash; Never Again!&rdquo;. The response from the BNP supporters was: &ldquo;7/7 &mdash; Never Again! 9/11 &mdash; Never Again!&rdquo; They sang Rule Britannia while their oppnents yelled &ldquo;Stop the Fascist Scum!&rdquo;<br>
