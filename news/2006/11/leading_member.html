<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A leading member of an extremist Islamic group is working as a senior official at the Home Office, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Abid Javaid is a &lsquo;senior executive officer&rsquo; in the IT department at the scandal-hit Immigration and Nationality Directorate which processes tens of thousands of asylum and visa applications every year.</p>
<p>But he is also an activist in the fundamentalist Islamic group Hizb-ut Tahrir which believes in a worldwide Islamic state under Shariah law.</p>
<p>This is despite Tony Blair calling for the group to be banned last year.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s smartly dressed spokesmen have caused repeated outrage over their refusal to condemn terrorist attacks including last year&rsquo;s London bombings.</p>
<p>One of their leaflets called for Jews to be murdered and for the destruction of Israel.</p>
<p>Another spokesman, Dr Imran Waheed, refused to condemn the July 7 suicide bombs, saying he would only do so after Western leaders apologise for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Last night the Tories described Javaid&rsquo;s employment as a &lsquo;disgrace&rsquo; and said it was further proof that both the Home Office and the IND remained &lsquo;unfit for purpose&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Patrick Mercer, the party&rsquo;s Homeland Security spokesman, said: &lsquo;I am amazed that this man has managed to infiltrate such a sensitive government department.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I find it deeply worrying. This is an insidious and dangerous organisation that is clearly trying to worm its way into as many government organisations as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In August 2005, the Prime Minister said that these people should be banned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, less than 18 months later, they are, to all intents and purposes, legal. This is a clandestine organisation which seeks to infiltrate wherever it can.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is further proof, if any were needed, that both the IND and the Home Office are unfit for purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Javaid works at Lunar House in Croydon, South London.</p>
<p>The tower block processes many of the tens of thousands of claims for asylum which are made to this country every year.</p>
<p>The IND has been at the centre of a series of recent scandals including the failure to deport foreign prisoners and claims that case workers offered a premium service to migrants if they agreed to perform sexual favours.</p>
<p>In another case, one senior official was sacked after being caught on camera offering to help a Zimbabwean rape victim with her claim in return for having sex with him.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of claims for visas and asylum are stacked in cardboard boxes and the IND has been accused of losing track of</p>
<p>applicants.</p>
<p>Javaid&rsquo;s dual role was revealed by a joint investigation by BBC2&rsquo;s Newsnight and File on 4 into &lsquo;Islamic infiltration&rsquo; in to everyday UK life.</p>
<p>The probe reveals that the civil servant is a prominent Hizb-ut Tahrir activist in South London.</p>
<p>He has represented the group in talks with the Croydon Mosque &mdash; which has been trying to kick out radical influences.</p>
<p>Tony Blair made his pledge to ban the group in a tough talking speech after the July 7 bombings in London last year.</p>
<p>He vowed to outlaw extremist groups and said: &lsquo;Let no one be in any doubt that the rules of the game are changing. People can&rsquo;t come here and abuse our good nature and our tolerance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They can&rsquo;t come here and start inciting our young people in communities to take up violence against British people here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last year, the group said suicide bombers were no worse than moderate Muslims. Their articulate spokesmen frequently appear on TV as the &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; face of Islamic extremism.</p>
<p>But critics point out that the group has been particularly effective at radicalising young students on university campuses.</p>
<p>The investigation also revealed that exiled Islamic cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed is allegedly using a variety of pseudonyms to broadcast support for terrorism in the UK via the Internet.</p>
<p>Bakri, who was banned from the UK last August, apparently praised the July 7 bombers and, in a chatroom conversation, appeared to advocate an attack on Dublin airport.</p>
<p>In one recent broadcast, he said the 7/7 suicide bombers were &lsquo;in paradise&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He also reportedly said: &lsquo;How can you condemn those great men &mdash; it&rsquo;s not something so bad, something so good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something so good to be involved in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The BBC said Bakri&rsquo;s chatroom had been infiltrated by a group called Vigil, including former police and security service personnel, which aims to disrupt extremist activity.</p>
<p>Asked by one of its undercover operatives whether Dublin Airport should be a terrorist target because US troops transit there on the way to Iraq, Bakri allegedly said in response: &lsquo;Hit the target and hit it very hard, that issue should be understood. Your situation there is quite difficult therefore the answer lies in your question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One academic, who is a member of Vigil, said he went to the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist hotline with more than 100 hours of material from the chatroom only to be told to contact his local police station.</p>
<p>A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: &lsquo;The Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command is working closely with Vigil, and in particular its director and spokesman who has made officers aware of chatroom material.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This material will be considered and appropriate action taken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bakri was barred from Britain last August after the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke ruled his presence was &lsquo;not conducive to the public good&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He founded the now-disbanded radical Islamic group Al Muhajiroun, which was based in Tottenham, North London.</p>
<p>Last night a Home Office spokesman said: &lsquo;Home Office civil servants are expected to abide by Home Office rules governing their conduct. They are also subject to the Civil Service code.&rsquo;<br>
