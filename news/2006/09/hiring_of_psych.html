<h1>Hiring Of Psychic Haunts Bogota Official</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Oshua Goodman, AP, September 19, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Colombia&rsquo;s chief prosecutor hired a psychic who hypnotized his staff and even performed an exorcism over a voodoo doll in exchange for a government paycheck and use of an armored car.</p>
<p>The ensuing scandal has mesmerized the nation.</p>
<p>The federal prosecutor, Mario Iguaran, says he hired Armando Marti last year to help his stressed-out staff deal with a crushing caseload and to improve human relations.</p>
<p>Marti, a self-described clairvoyant, claims to have implicated corrupt workers in illegal wiretaps and bribery during the months he spent roaming the prosecutor&rsquo;s heavily fortified bunker, hypnotizing officials and writing up classified reports for Iguaran about staff loyalty.</p>
<p>He says workers confessed to deep secrets and ratted out colleagues as they stared into his eyes. The operation, according to leaked documents published by the newsweekly Semana, was code-named &ldquo;Mission Perseus of Zeus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The revelation that Marti was granted unfettered access has plunged into scandal one of Colombia&rsquo;s most respected institutions, an independent body responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes in a nation torn by decades of violent, drug-fueled conflict.</p>
<p>In one incident, recounted by Marti to Semana, he performed a candlelit exorcism to neutralize a voodoo doll found stabbed with needles in the wastebasket of Iguaran&rsquo;s former top assistant.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Marti called the Semana article, titled &ldquo;The Federal Prosecutor&rsquo;s Rasputin,&rdquo; accurate but sought to dispel the emphasis it placed on black magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My work didn&rsquo;t consist of witchcraft or anything paranormal, but scientifically proven techniques to boost morale and release tension among the staff,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The fact that Marti rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful came as little surprise in Colombia. Posted on his Web site &mdash; before overloaded bandwidth took it off-line &mdash; are photos with a bevy of famous former clients, including President Alvaro Uribe.</p>
<p>What scandalized Colombians were revelations that the federal prosecutor&rsquo;s office paid the psychic as much as $1,800 a month and authorized him to carry a pistol, an employee badge and to ride around in a government-issued armored vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I needed protection, not from outside the (federal prosecutor&rsquo;s) bunker, but from the internal divisions within,&rdquo; Marti told the AP.</p>
<p>Marti said he became a confidante of Iguaran, one of the country&rsquo;s most trusted politicians, by helping him overcome marital problems. When the Dalai Lama visited Colombia in May, Marti arranged a private, two-hour meeting for the chief prosecutor with the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
<p>On Monday, Iguaran delivered a televised apology to the nation for the &ldquo;unfortunate incident that began as something folksily quaint but that has now ended up affecting the institutional well-being of the federal prosecutor&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he had ordered his office to terminate its contract with the consulting team to which Marti belongs. He also offered to cooperate with any congressional investigation.</p>
<p>What remains unanswered is who leaked the embarrassing information &mdash; and why.</p>
<p>Iguaran has attributed the leak to &ldquo;dark forces.&rdquo; His potential enemies include cocaine kingpins trying to prevent extradition to the United States and government officials accused of working on their behalf.</p>
<p>In recent months, Iguaran has brought homicide charges against an army colonel and 14 of his men in the slaughter of an elite, 10-man anti-drug unit. Officials originally described the May 22 killings as a case of friendly fire, but Iguaran alleged they were murders on behalf of drug traffickers.</p>
<p>Iguaran insists his relationship with Marti didn&rsquo;t affect his professional duty to uphold the law, but his loyalty to the psychic, even in the wake of the scandal, has left Colombia spellbound.</p>
<p>In a television interview Monday evening, Iguaran said: &ldquo;I have to confess he was my friend and as such I opened my hands, my house and my heart to him.&rdquo;</p>
