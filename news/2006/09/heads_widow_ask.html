<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2010064.stm">Head&rsquo;s Widow Asked To Apologise To Killer</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, May 27, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The widow of head teacher Philip Lawrence has described her &ldquo;extreme upset&rdquo; at being asked to apologise to his teenage killer.</p>
<p>Frances Lawrence, 51, told how a probation officer rang her at home and said that Learco Chindamo had become upset after she criticised him for his lack of remorse.</p>
<p>Mrs Lawrence, a mother of four, said the officer claimed an apology would make Chindamo &ldquo;feel happier&rdquo; when he came before a panel which was deciding whether his life sentence should be cut.</p>
<p>Chindamo was 15 when he stabbed Mr Lawrence to death as he defended a pupil outside St George&rsquo;s Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale, west London in December 1995.</p>
<p>Mrs Lawrence had criticised the youth in several television programmes, but it was unclear which one had upset him.</p>
<p>Mrs Lawrence said of the probation officer&rsquo;s call: &ldquo;She left a message on the answering machine for my children to hear, which I was not happy about at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was direct and very cross with me on the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Lawrence said: &ldquo;I was very shocked after I heard the whole thing and it was very surreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said it was because he [Chindamo] would be very upset at his &lsquo;lifer board&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;I was shocked and I said that I was not going to say anything to her and would take the matter further, which I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Appeal refused</strong></p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &ldquo;The National Probation Service places great importance on its duty to victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However this contact which took place over six months ago was entirely inappropriate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief probation officer of the area concerned and a representative of the National Probation Service have since visited Mrs Lawrence to apologise for this mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An internal investigation was conducted and appropriate action was taken with regard to the officer concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chindamo, a member of a gang of youths, was convicted of the killing at the Old Bailey in 1996 and jailed for life.</p>
<p>Last year an attempt to have his minimum sentence cut from 12 years was turned down.<br>
