<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5385752.stm">Ring Of Steel Divides Padua</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Fraser, BBC News, September 28, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Anelli estate in Padua is a cluster of crumbling high-rise flats.</p>
<p>It was built in the 1980s to house the city&rsquo;s considerable student population.</p>
<p>These days it is home to several hundred African immigrants.</p>
<p>It has a reputation for crime, drugs and prostitution, and is a constant source of angry complaints from local Italian residents.</p>
<p>This summer, after riots between opposing gangs, the left-leaning mayor of Padua took a drastic decision to seal off the estate &mdash; with a metal wall.</p>
<p>It is 85m (290ft) long, 3m (10ft) high and it stretches along one side of the estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an instrument of segregation,&rdquo; said Mayor Flavio Zanonato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just want to limit the activity of the drug pushers here. This isn&rsquo;t a wall in Palestine. It&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s harder for drug dealers to jump over.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Not a solution</strong></p>
<p>But those who live behind the wall say they feel like they have been imprisoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people on the other side of this wall don&rsquo;t want to know the people in here,&rdquo; said Ibude Agboneta, a Nigerian immigrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They built this wall to hide the problems. But they will not solve the problems in this city by blocking them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fence has been dubbed Padua&rsquo;s Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>An exaggeration &mdash; but it is a wall and it is standing between communities.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a symbol of the problems Italy is facing with integration.</p>
<p>The estate is neither pretty nor comfortable. Most flats have no heating. Graffiti has been sprayed on walls and water trickles down the staircases.</p>
<p><strong>Gang violence</strong></p>
<p>There are racial tensions here. Fights between Christian and Muslim gangs are common. Most of it is over drugs.</p>
<p>The riots in July were so bad that some local residents demanded the wall be built around the entire estate.</p>
<p>There is only one way into the complex, through a police checkpoint.</p>
<p>Uniformed officers now vet everyone coming and going.</p>
<p>The wall has limited the drug-dealing. In fact some of the inhabitants welcome the changes it has brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; said Iroh. &ldquo;This way drug dealers cannot come and go all the time, there is more control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Iroh also accuses the police of &ldquo;not doing enough to protect those who are not part of the drug-trafficking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are young families trapped inside the estate. Families that are frightened, intimidated and stigmatised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lived here with my wife and two children for a year,&rdquo; says Ibude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was terrified for them. It was no place for children to be. There were drug dealers prowling the estate, addicts sleeping in the corridors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shared one bedroom with no windows and we paid 600 euros (Â£400) a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is terrible poverty in here &mdash; and it&rsquo;s hard to escape. This estate breeds crime!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Immigration debate</strong></p>
<p>Three of the six buildings were evacuated in 2005, and more than 300 people relocated by the local administration. The remaining three blocks will be closed next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; said Daniela Ruffini, head of Padua&rsquo;s immigration and housing committee, &ldquo;is to integrate the immigrant families and break down the barriers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the truth, say some, is that the authorities cannot find enough landlords prepared to take them.</p>
<p>There are often bitter complaints when Africans move into a predominantly Italian neighbourhood and the council has to guarantee the rent.</p>
<p>Immigration is a touchy issue in the Veneto region, which is one of the main electoral strongholds of the anti-immigration Northern League party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people like to forget what jobs these immigrants are doing in our community,&rdquo; said Daniela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They work in our factories, they build our houses, and they nurse our old people. They do many of the jobs Italians don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are essential to preserving our standard of living &mdash; but at night when the work is finished there are some people in this city who would prefer to forget they are here. &ldquo;</p>
<p>Padua has a population of 205,000. The province has a migrant population of 70,000.</p>
<p>According to the local authority, one in three of the new-borns in the city is now of foreign origin.</p>
<p>Most find work in local factories. But the pay is poor.</p>
<p>The current law demands migrants have a job contract when they arrive, and it restricts their stay to two years.</p>
<p>Critics say it is a law on control and exploitation of the workforce, not on the integration of people who come to Italy to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes work 22-hour days,&rdquo; says Ibudi, a cleaner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know I don&rsquo;t get the same pay as the Italians I work with. I don&rsquo;t get holiday pay or any benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you obey the rules in this country and you don&rsquo;t ask too many questions, you can stay. But if you challenge your boss and ask why you get paid less than the Italians you will be unemployed in an instant!&rdquo;<br>
