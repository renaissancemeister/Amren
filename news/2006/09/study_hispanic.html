	<p>Raleigh, N.C. &mdash; About 60 percent of Hispanic immigrants in parts of North Carolina and Virginia are struggling to put food on the table for their families, according to a new study from researchers at Wake Forest University.</p>
<p>Four surveys covering 317 Latino families &mdash; mostly from rural North Carolina &mdash; found that many cash-strapped immigrants showed signs of severe hunger. More than 25 percent said their children did not have enough food to eat and sometimes had to go all day without a full meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people are living very close to the bone,&rdquo; said researcher Sara Quandt, the lead author of the study, one of the first to analyze hunger in the U.S. immigrant population.</p>
<p>Food shortages among Hispanic immigrants were far higher than the national average of about 13 percent, the study found. Results from the four surveys &mdash; taken in different regions &mdash; found that between 49 and 71 percent of respondents described levels of food insecurity, meaning that they were constantly struggling to provide for their families.</p>
<p>As many as 19 percent &mdash; five times more than normal &mdash; reported a worse problem: poverty-inflicted hunger.</p>
<p>Quandt noted from interviews that many immigrants were ashamed to seek services, and some &mdash; possibly those who had entered the U.S. illegally &mdash; were unable to get government food aid altogether.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study, which Quandt indicated could be representative of Hispanic immigrant populations around the nation, did not question participants about their legal status. However, a number of respondents reported sending money back to family members in Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>North Carolina has been a magnet for Hispanic immigrants over the past decade. North Carolina has been a magnet for Hispanic immigrants over the past decade, with a Latino population burgeoning to more than 553,000, according to state data.</p>
<p>But Raleigh-based advocacy group El Pueblo said the plight of the Latino population is largely ignored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have struggles advocating on behalf of Latinos for basic rights like education and public health care,&rdquo; said Zulayka Santiago, executive director of El Pueblo. &ldquo;Because Latinos are often categorized along with the undocumented population, efforts to meet the needs of this population unfortunately turns into a polarized debate &mdash; the questions of rights and legality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us, it&rsquo;s always issue of basic human rights.&rdquo;</p>
