<h1><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060925-111214-8621r.htm">Texas Sheriffs Slam Inaction On Border</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, September 26, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of Texas sheriffs says the Department of Homeland Security has been &ldquo;doing a lot of talking&rdquo; about securing the nation&rsquo;s borders, but America&rsquo;s Southwest continues to be overrun with illegal aliens, illicit drugs and rising violence.</p>
<p>    &ldquo;Maybe the time has come to do some listening,&rdquo; the coalition said in a statement, adding that the &ldquo;sound of honest dialogue from Texas is reverberating from El Paso to Brownsville &hellip; and the border is not yet secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>    The Texas Border Sheriff&rsquo;s Coalition, whose jurisdictions include the 1,200-mile U.S.-Mexico border, says it is talking with state leaders &ldquo;about what they are doing, not what they plan to do when political currents change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>    Overwhelmed by a flood of illegal aliens and drugs along with increasing border violence, the coalition formed to seek funding from federal and state officials to help pay for rapidly escalating border-enforcement costs.</p>
<p>    Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr., who has fewer than two dozen deputies to patrol nearly 1,000 square miles, including 60 miles of Texas-Mexico border, said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff&rsquo;s assertion that the United States is making progress in the war on terror on the border is misleading.</p>
<p>    Mr. Chertoff has touted a reduction in apprehensions of illegal aliens from countries other than Mexico and a decline in drug seizures, saying both were the result of an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents and the assignment of 6,000 National Guard troops along the border.</p>
<p>    &ldquo;The reduction of apprehensions and seizures that Mr. Chertoff talks about comes as a result of transferring many agents away from Texas to other states,&rdquo; said Sheriff Gonzalez.</p>
<p>    &ldquo;When you have less vigilance, obviously you are going to have less apprehensions and seizures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>    Sheriff Gonzalez also had words of advice for Mr. Chertoff: &ldquo;If you want to hear the sound of people working hard, take a trip to Texas, keep your mouth closed for a few minutes, grow a big set of ears and listen. You&rsquo;ll hear that crime is down because extra sheriffs&rsquo; units are patrolling the broken borders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>    Much of the coalition&rsquo;s concerns center on increased incidents of violence along the border because of alien and drug smugglers, much of it targeting U.S. law-enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>    Last week, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico also issued a stern warning to Americans planning to visit that country, asking them to exercise extreme caution because of &ldquo;the rising level of brutal violence&rdquo; south of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>    Ambassador Tony Garza said violence had escalated throughout Mexico with sharp increases in homicides and kidnappings of Mexican and American citizens alike.</p>
