<h1>What The Polls Aren&rsquo;t Telling Us: Experts Say Support For MCRI Is Likely Underestimated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Nowinski, Michigan Daily, September 19, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, a proposal that would ban some affirmative action programs in Michigan, could dramatically change the way the University operates.</p>
<p>The question is, will it pass?</p>
<p>Despite poll data that shows voters are split on the issue, there are indications that the proposal is likely to pass.</p>
<p>The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press have both released polls in the past two weeks. The News showed MCRI, which will be listed as Proposal 2 on the ballot, up by nine points. The Free Press had it down by two points.</p>
<p>Both polls also showed unusually high numbers of undecided voters.</p>
<p>And both are likely wrong.</p>
<p>Along with others, these polls seem to indicate that Proposal 2 remains in a dead heat, but there are three stories that these numbers do not tell, say several political analysts.</p>
<p>Support for Proposal 2 &mdash; and opposition to affirmative action &mdash; may be significantly underestimated.</p>
<p>Similar initiatives passed by large margins in California in 1996 and Washington in 1998, despite pre-election polls that predicted a close vote.</p>
<p>The polls showed support for Proposition 209 in California and I-200 in Washington weakening as the pro-affirmative action campaigns intensified their efforts in the final weeks before the vote.</p>
<p>One week before the Washington election, a poll published by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer claimed that Proposition I-200&rsquo;s 20-point lead had evaporated.</p>
<p>Election returns proved this finding false: I-200 passed with a comfortable 16-percent margin.</p>
<p>Michigan could follow the lead of California and Washington.</p>
<p>In general, voters are reluctant to tell pollsters their opinions on sensitive issues, especially those concerning race, said Ed Sarpolus, vice president of EPIC/MRA, the firm that conducted the Detroit News poll.</p>
<p>In the final weeks before an election, opponents can usually put a serious dent in support, and undecided votes tend to check &lsquo;No&rsquo;, he said.</p>
<p>Supporters of a ballot initiative would want to have about 60 or 70 percent of voters planning to vote &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; at this point in the election cycle, Sarpolus said. Based on the News and the Free Press polls, Proposal 2 doesn&rsquo;t have that. Although Proposal 2 is now polling below 50 percent, Sarpolus said it has a good shot to pass.</p>
<p>Mark Grebner, founder of the Lansing-based Practical Political Consulting, said people who would vote for MCRI are often reluctant to voice their opinions over the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you ask someone about race over the phone, there is a lot of pressure to be a righteous person,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>More people may be against affirmative action than those who are willing to admit it on the phone.</p>
<p>Since pollsters started measuring public support for the proposal last year, the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; vote has eroded from 70 percent to less than 50 percent as groups opposing the measure &mdash; including the Democratic Party, labor unions and several large Michigan corporations &mdash; have waged an aggressive ad campaign against the proposal.</p>
<p>In Michigan, supporters and opponents of MCRI have been campaigning since the U.S. Supreme Court largely upheld the University&rsquo;s affirmative action programs in 2003.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the past year, opponents of the MCRI have been casting it as a proposal that hurts everyone, especially women,&rdquo; Sarpolus said. &ldquo;But if Ward Connerly can turn it back into a black versus white issue, like he did in Washington and California, it will pass.&rdquo;</p>
