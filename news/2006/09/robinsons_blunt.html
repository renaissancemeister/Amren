<h1>Robinson&rsquo;s Blunt Advertising Campaign Goes Mainstream</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Baker, AP, September 12, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Raleigh, N.C. &mdash; After months of running blunt but popular advertising on the radio and the Internet, congressional candidate Vernon Robinson has taken his campaign to television.</p>
<p>Robinson has bought about 3,000 cable TV spots to run across North Carolina&rsquo;s 13th District &mdash; a $30,000 preliminary buy that criticizes incumbent Democratic Rep. Brad Miller&rsquo;s stance on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad Miller voted to give these illegal aliens driver&rsquo;s licenses, Social Security benefits and many other government freebies,&rdquo; says the narrator of Robinson&rsquo;s 60-second ad. &ldquo;He actually voted to allow convicted child molesters to immigrate to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ad refers to a vote in December, when Miller joined most of his fellow Democrats and a few Republicans to oppose a measure aimed at increasing border security. One provision of the bill would explicitly bar convicted child sex offenders from moving to the United States.</p>
<p>Miller&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman called the spot &ldquo;another ridiculous Robinson ad,&rdquo; and said Miller voted against the bill because its reforms were inadequate. The bill passed the House and it now sits before a Senate committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just another cry for attention,&rdquo; said spokeswoman LuAnn Canipe, who added Miller is aggressively seeking immigration reforms, including additional money for the border patrol. &ldquo;And the ads do get attention. But did he run out of catchy jingles this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of Robinson&rsquo;s earlier ads played off pop culture. An audio-only spot used during automated calls to voters is based on the classic TV show &ldquo;The Beverly Hillbillies.&rdquo; A video that got thousands of clicks on the Internet draws from the television shows &ldquo;The Twilight Zone&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leave It To Beaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A radio ad backed by mariachi music also blasted Miller&rsquo;s immigration stance, saying that &ldquo;if Miller had his way, America would be nothing but one big fiesta for illegal aliens and homosexuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advertisement now running on cable television mimics a notorious commercial aired by former North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms. In his 1990 victory against former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, Helms depicted a pair of white hands crumpling a job rejection letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needed that job,&rdquo; Helms&rsquo; ad said. &ldquo;And you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robinson, who once introduced himself to voters as a black Jesse Helms and counts the former senator as a political idol, shows a pair of black hands crumpling a letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needed that job,&rdquo; the ad says. &ldquo;And you were the best qualified. But they gave it to an illegal alien so they could pay him under the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the first time during this campaign that Robinson has moved an ad from the Internet to television. His online campaigning has been successful, and he credits drawing $521,021 in donations last quarter to Miller&rsquo;s $362,126 in part to their popularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about the issue &mdash; illegal immigration &mdash; that the overwhelming number of Americans are concerned about,&rdquo; Robinson said Tuesday.</p>
