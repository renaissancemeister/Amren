<h1><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/comments.php?comments_id=6223">George Allen And Allegations Of The N-Word</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Kemp, American Thinker, September 28, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It seems that the Democrats are now claiming, via the vehicle of an article in <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/comments.php?comments_id=6223"><em>Salon</em> </a>Magazine, that Sen. George Allen used the N-word in his college football playing days. In all &ldquo;fairness,&rdquo; Salon contacted 19 of George Allen&rsquo;s former teammates and they stated that he did not use that word or act in a racially insensitive manner. If <em>Salon</em> contacted them and found this to be the teammates&rsquo; story, then why did they publish the charge in the first place? </p>
<p>Tom Riehl has found additional <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/comments.php?comments_id=6223">reason </a>to doubt the story. </p>
<p>The <em>New York Times,</em> never one to miss a chance to publish an unverified and unverifiable story &mdash; if it makes a Republican look bad &mdash; repeated the story in print. So did the <em>Washington Post,</em> the major national paper closest to Sen. Allen&rsquo;s state of Virginia, one widely read in vote-rich northern Virginia. I personally don&rsquo;t believe the charge, but that is both my political prejudice &mdash; and the fact that this is a hearsay charge, i.e., with no proof coming forward that would hold up either in court or in a publication with higher standards of fact checking than the <em>New York Times.</em> By that I mean such publications as <em>The Weekly Reader</em> and <em>The National Enquirer,</em> as well as major newspapers. But while we&rsquo;re on the subject of politicians and the N-word, a few minutes on the internet comes up with some interesting non-hearsay about some prominent Democrats. First we have this from the April 19, 2006 <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/opinion/14372107.htm"><em>Kansas City Star.</em></a> I edited the full spelling of the N-word in the book title.</p>
<blockquote> &ldquo;Randall Kennedy&rsquo;s 2002 book, <em>N-word: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word,</em> generates a lot of anxiety. I know now why a federal judge said he had someone else pick up the book for him.&rdquo; 
<blockquote>&lsquo;But Kennedy said Presidents Harry S. Truman and Lyndon Johnson used the word in private conversations, &ldquo;and yet both surprised observers by taking unprecedented steps to elevate the fortunes of Negro Americans.&rdquo; &rsquo;</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>I recall seeing Julian Bond on a PBS television show talk about Pres. Johnson slipping and using the N-word in his presence and then apologizing. I can&rsquo;t cite sources for that specific incident, but I do have the <em>Kansas City Star</em> story above. Then there is the matter of Sen. Byrd using the N-word in a March 4, 2001 Fox television interview. As <em>Free Republic</em> <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/810507/posts">stated </a>at that time,</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;You read that right: the man who was at that time the President Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate &mdash; third in line to the presidency of the United States &mdash; used the &ldquo;N-word&rdquo; on national television. TWICE.
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he issued a written apology by the next day. But the episode barely got a mention in the major news media, and was never condemned by the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP, Rainbow/PUSH, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, or any other leading civil rights group or leader. Tom Daschle, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Kweisi Mfume &mdash; none of them issued a single press release on this incident.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>Then we have, in 2001, California Lt. Governor and Democrat Cruz Bustamante using the N-word before a group of black trade unionists. A <em>Mother Jones</em> article <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2001/02/bustamante.html">claims</a> it was unintentional and I will give him that. It is very understanding of them, but it definitely shows a state of mind. Mr. Bustamante still today holds his high office.</p>
<p>So what can we conclude? To me, it looks like a case of selective outrage. And outrage against an unproved and possibly unprovable claim. </p>
