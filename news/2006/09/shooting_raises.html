<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After a capital-murder charge was filed against an illegal immigrant in connection with the death of Officer Rodney Johnson, Chief Harold Hurtt firmly defended the Houston Police Department&rsquo;s policy of not enforcing immigration laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the government would fulfill their responsibility of protecting the border,&rdquo; he told reporters Friday afternoon, &ldquo;we probably would not be standing here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The urgency of the immediate loss highlighted a breakdown prompted by several factors &mdash; the loose nets of an immigration system that allowed a deported man to slip back into the country illegally, a hidden gun that Johnson overlooked inside the suspect&rsquo;s waistband and a means of restraint that somehow allowed the handcuffed man to reach that weapon and pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Early Friday morning, the suspect, Juan Leonardo Quintero, a 32-year-old Mexican national, appeared briefly in the 248th state District Court, where he was informed of the charge against him.</p>
<p>Homicide Sgt. Mark Newcomb said officers &ldquo;got a full confession&rdquo; from Quintero.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the investigation of Thursday&rsquo;s shooting near Hobby Airport continued, homicide Capt. Dale Brown said Johnson was shot after a pat-down search of Quintero, while the suspect was handcuffed in the back seat of his patrol car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officer apparently just missed the weapon during the pat-down search,&rdquo; Brown said.</p>
<p>Johnson had stopped Quintero for driving a white Ford pickup at 50 mph in a 30 mph zone, Brown said. The officer decided to arrest Quintero for driving without a license or any other form of identification, then handcuffed Quintero, conducted the pat down and placed him in the back of his patrol car.</p>
<p>Johnson then called for a wrecker driver to tow the truck Quintero had been driving.</p>
<p>Quintero had been working for a landscaping company in the Deer Park area and was driving a company Ford double-cab pickup, Brown said.</p>
<p>Brown added that Quintero had concealed a 9 mm handgun in the waistband of his pants. Johnson was fatally wounded by four shots to the head and face.</p>
<p>Although Quintero was handcuffed behind his back, Brown said, he apparently manipulated his hands under his legs to the front of his body so he could fire the gun.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When witnesses arrived at the scene, Brown said, &ldquo;They saw him with the gun, with the slide open, in front of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tow truck driver who responded to Johnson&rsquo;s call was the first person to arrive on the scene, Brown said. The driver approached Johnson&rsquo;s patrol car, observed him &ldquo;in some distress&rdquo; and Quintero then fired one time, missing the wrecker driver, Brown said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shortly after that, other officers arrived, Brown said.</p>
<p>The officers who then arrested him placed the handcuffs &ldquo;behind him,&rdquo; Brown said.</p>
<p>Brown said the suspect did not tell investigators why he fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing definitive &hellip;,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;My personal belief is that he was upset about being arrested rather than being written a ticket. And I believe he was upset, because he knew he was going to be discovered as a deported alien, and that he was going to spend several years in a federal prison before being deported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quintero was deported as an illegal felon in 1999, following a charge of indecency with a child, Brown said.</p>
<p>Court records show Quintero was given deferred adjudication in that case. Brown said Quintero&rsquo;s previous criminal record included an arrest for driving while intoxicated, for driving with a suspended license and for failing to stop and give information after an automobile accident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the arrest of an illegal immigrant renewed debate among local members of Congress over enforcement of immigration laws, in particular Hurtt&rsquo;s policy of prohibiting HPD officers from questioning suspects about their residency.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement at issue</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Humble, said the shooting highlighted the need to tighten the borders and beef up enforcement of immigration laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that 25 homicides a day are committed by people who are illegally in the country and this is one more,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Poe said police officers should have the authority to arrest people in the country illegally. He said Houston is viewed as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city of Houston has created an atmosphere that it&rsquo;s a sanctuary for illegals,&rdquo; Poe said. &ldquo;They knew that, and that&rsquo;s why they go to Houston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other lawmakers said that while the shooting was unfortunate, it should not be used for political grandstanding on the eve of a general election.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, said Johnson&rsquo;s family deserves justice. But, she added, the incident should not detract from efforts to reform current immigration laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all are suffering from overwhelming grief for the loss of officer Rodney Johnson (but) this is certainly not the time to make blanket accusations,&rdquo; Jackson Lee said, &ldquo;but rather it is a time to unite to fight crime where crime exists. We should seek to solve all other problems or issues dealing with immigration away from this terrible tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, said Friday that using the crime for political reasons is unfortunate, especially for the family and friends of Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officer was killed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and whether he was a legal resident or not a legal resident the officer was still killed. That&rsquo;s the tragic part. There&rsquo;s no doubt that some of my colleagues who only want to do border protection will say this is what we need to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Throughout HPD, officers expressed their mourning with a strip of black across their badges. Flags at all city buildings were flown at half-staff in Johnson&rsquo;s honor. At the 11 p.m. roll call at some substations Thursday night, photographs of Johnson were posted.</p>
<p>Many officers took time out to remember Johnson&rsquo;s friendly demeanor and love for his family and fellow officers.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://216.87.159.39/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=12559">Murder of Houston Officer Polarizes Immigration Players</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>KBTV 4 News, September 26, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Harris County DA Chuck Rosenthal says he is &ldquo;coming out of retirement&rdquo; to handle the case against an illegal immigrant who allegedly shot a police officer four times during a traffic stop.</p>
<p>The community is paying its respects today to Rodney Johnson, even while the Mexican government declares it is monitoring every aspect of the trial &mdash; and will assist Juan Leonardo Quintero if an appeal is necessary after a trial.</p>
<p>Police have said they obtained &ldquo;a full confession&rdquo; from Quintero, who was still locked in the back seat of Johnson`s patrol car &mdash; along with a pistol &mdash; when officers arrived after the shooting Thursday.</p>
<p>Rosenthal said he could not recall the last time he helped prosecute a case, but guessed that it has been several years.</p>
<p>He said the police officer case is somewhat &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; because Quintero is accused of committing murder even though he was in a situation where he could not escape.</p>
