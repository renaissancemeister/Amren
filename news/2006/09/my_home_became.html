<h1>My Home Became A Ghetto: As Immigrants Moved In, Our Peaceful Neighborhood Declined</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phillip J. Hubbell, Dallas Morning News, September 3, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I&rsquo;m a Fort Worth native and lifelong Texan who&rsquo;s spent the last 21 years living and working in North Texas. But now, I&rsquo;m living in Omaha, Neb. </p>
<p>I love my home state and never would have moved if my company hadn&rsquo;t transferred me. I could have delayed the move until 2009, but I decided to get out of Carrollton sooner, before my property value plummeted even further. That, plus I was getting tired of having to make an effort to be understood in English in my own town. </p>
<p>The two are connected. </p>
<p>The property values in my south Carrollton neighborhood had been steadily rising for years. My wife and I bought our home in 1988 when she became pregnant with our second child. It was a nice, quiet neighborhood on a dead-end street. Lots of little homes whose owners took responsibility for the upkeep, mowed their lawns and who had pride in the look of the place. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about skin color, ethnicity, religion, creed or anything other than the content of someone&rsquo;s character. These are external attributes and have no bearing on whether someone is a good neighbor or a good person. Ours was a mixed neighborhood, with whites, African-Americans, Asians, Hispanics, Middle Easterners and even some gay folks. </p>
<p>At some point things changed. The trigger was 9/11. A lot of people lost their jobs as a result of the economic downturn caused by that event &mdash; myself included. The economic demographic of the neighborhood changed, and so did the general makeup of our part of town, which includes southern Carrollton and northern Farmers Branch. Along with a lot of the houses becoming rental properties, the number of Hispanics whom I believe to be illegal aliens skyrocketed. </p>
<p>For some reason Farmers Branch and southern Carrollton seem a favorite stopping off point for these lawbreakers. Our government declines to do anything about people breaking these laws, and people who complain are branded as racist. Of course being called a racist these days on the immigration issue doesn&rsquo;t really mean much. It just means that you disagree with blame-America-first liberals on the left and open-borders, cheap-labor businesspeople on the right. </p>
<p>All of a sudden, we had many new residents who could not speak English and who didn&rsquo;t appear to be interested in learning. It wasn&rsquo;t a melting pot so much as a ghetto. Labor-intensive businesses started operating out of houses in our neighborhood. Some days you could hardly drive down the street for all the cars. A vacant house suddenly became a makeshift parking lot for what appeared to be a makeshift auto repair shop. Jobless homeowners turned over a number of houses to renters. Property values stagnated. </p>
<p>People who didn&rsquo;t care what their houses and yards looked like moved into the neighborhood. The residents of a house might have six to eight cars with a garage filled to overflowing with old furniture and appliances. When room ran out in driveways and in front of a house, the cars moved into yards. Then property values started to slip. </p>
<p>Our little neighborhood was becoming shabby. When I was growing up, if a house had residents who trashed their front yards, the city issued citations and got the place cleaned up. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a priority of city governments any longer. </p>
<p>I could see the years of equity we put into our house slipping down the drain as our once-pleasant mixed neighborhood turned into a dump. I could also see that neither the federal government, nor the state government, nor the city government was going to do anything to help people like me. And I know how the game is played in the media: People like me are routinely depicted as ignorant racist rednecks. We can&rsquo;t win. </p>
