<h1>Mexico Opposed To U.S. Border Fence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, September 29, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico City &mdash; Mexico warned Thursday that the U.S. proposal to build miles of border fence will damage relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Foreign Relations Department said it was &ldquo;deeply worried&rdquo; about the proposal, which is working its way through the Senate, adding it will &ldquo;increase tension in border communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These measures will harm the bilateral relationship. They are against the spirit of co-operation that is needed to guarantee security on the common border,&rdquo; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives and Senate are maneuvering to speed construction of a 700-mile fence along the United States&rsquo; southern border aimed at keeping migrants and criminals from entering the country illegally.</p>
<p>A House-Senate homeland security funding bill containing $1.2 billion to begin building the fence could be passed and sent to President Bush before lawmakers depart Washington this weekend.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Relations Department said that only a comprehensive immigration reform would stop millions of Mexicans sneaking across its northern desert and swimming over the Rio Grande into the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A partial measure that is exclusively focused on security does not deal with reality and represents a political answer rather than a viable solution,&rdquo; it said in the statement.</p>
<p>President Vicente Fox has rallied against the wall, calling it &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; and comparing it to the Berlin Wall, which divided Germany.</p>
<p>President-elect Felipe Calderon, who takes over from Fox on Dec.1, has also spoken out against the measure.</p>

								<h2>Tunnel Extended Into U.S., Authorities Say; 5 Detained</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Anna Cearley, San Diego Union-Tribune, September 28, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Tijuana &mdash; U.S. authorities determined yesterday that a tunnel under construction on the Mexican side of the San Ysidro border crossing had actually extended into the United States.</p>
<p>The tunnel crossed about 15 feet into U.S. territory, though it had no exit on the U.S. side, said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities detained five people &mdash; including two Mexican Customs inspectors &mdash; suspected of being involved in the construction. The tunnel was found Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities found digging equipment inside the 4-foot-by-4-foot tunnel, which had been reinforced with wood and plastic, Mack said.</p>
<p>Though it wasn&rsquo;t as sophisticated as other tunnels found along the border, the find was notable because it implicates members of Mexican Customs.</p>
<p>The tunnel, like four others found over the past year in the same general area, originated in a gated junkyard that the federal agency uses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the suspects caught at the tunnel, Carlos López López, 27, was overseeing the construction, according to a news release from Mexico&rsquo;s federal secretary of public security.</p>
<p>López allegedly was paying $20 a day to two other suspects caught with him &mdash; Sergio Macías Ángel, 32, and Claudio Rivera Miramontes, 52 &mdash; to dig the passageway from 7 p.m. and 4 a.m., the release said.</p>
<p>Also found with them was Customs inspector Rubén Contreras Hernández, 32, who was detained. Contreras said his supervisor had forced him to stand guard during the construction, the release said.</p>
<p>The supervisor, identified as Jesús Roberto Girón Rodríguez, was taken into custody.</p>
