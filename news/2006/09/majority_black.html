<h1><a href="/search/index-ssf_/base/news/1158225573105630.xml">Majority Black, White Schools Unite To Stage &lsquo;Mockingbird&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hannah Wolfson, Birmingham News, September 14, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird,&rdquo; Atticus Finch tells his children that you can&rsquo;t understand a person &ldquo;until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Roman Gladney, a 6-foot-plus senior from Fairfield Preparatory High School, and Alex Trulock, a diminutive Mountain Brook High School 10th-grader who says he grew up steeped in racism, are doing as their schools put on a joint dramatization of the novel that earned them a rare meeting with the book&rsquo;s author, Nelle Harper Lee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like we&rsquo;re kind of changing stuff and taking a step,&rdquo; said Trulock, whom Lee hugged and pulled down to sit beside her as she shook hands before receiving the Birmingham Pledge Foundation&rsquo;s Lifetime Achievement Award. &ldquo;I think most of the people in Mountain Brook have barely ever talked to a black person, and it&rsquo;s not healthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat Yates, the Mountain Brook drama teacher who designed the joint production, said that&rsquo;s the goal of the project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This whole thing is an exercise in empathy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s putting these groups of students together from two different communities and seeing things from those two perspectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yates has wanted to put on &ldquo;Mockingbird&rdquo; for a decade, but felt it wouldn&rsquo;t be right to cast it out of Mountain Brook&rsquo;s student body, which is almost entirely white. So when she met Patsy Howze, Fairfield&rsquo;s choir director, at a workshop, she suggested a joint production.</p>
<p><strong>All about learning:</strong></p>
<p>Fairfield jumped at the chance to let its students &mdash; who have no drama department or even an auditorium &mdash; try drama. But it also gives students at the all-black school a chance to experience another culture, Howze said.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>But the grand prize was the invitation to meet Lee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my God, it was like I was meeting the president of the United States,&rdquo; said Gladney, who got a hug from Lee and an autograph before the author&rsquo;s escorts asked other visitors not to request autographs. He said he asked Lee about the Tom Robinson character, and she said he was &ldquo;a man with pride.&rdquo;</p>
