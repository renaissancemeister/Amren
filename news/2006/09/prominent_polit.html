<h1><a href="https://www.nysun.com/article/40451">Prominent Political Scientist Says Senator Used Racial Slur</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Lewis, AP, September 27, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Richmond, Va. &mdash; A noted political scientist joined one of Senator Allen&rsquo;s former college football teammates in claiming the senator used a racial slur to refer to blacks in the early 1970s, a claim that Mr. Allen dismisses as &ldquo;ludicrously false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Virginia&rsquo;s most-quoted political-science professors and a classmate of Mr. Allen&rsquo;s in the early 1970s, Larry Sabato said in a televised interview Monday that Mr. Allen used the epithet.</p>
<p>Mr. Sabato&rsquo;s assertion came on the heels of accusations by a radiologist who was a tight end and wide receiver for the University of Virginia in the early 1970s when Mr. Allen was quarterback, Dr. Ken Shelton. He said Mr. Allen not only used the N-word frequently but also once stuffed a severed deer head into a black family&rsquo;s large mailbox.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen&rsquo;s campaign released statements from four other ex-teammates defending the senator and rejecting Dr. Shelton&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Allen, a Republican, has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2008. Questions about racial insensitivity have dogged him during his re-election bid against Democrat Jim Webb.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;macaca&rdquo; in referring to a Webb campaign volunteer of Indian descent in August prompted an outcry. The word denotes a genus of monkeys and, in some cultures, is considered an ethnic slur. But the senator insisted that he did not know that and had simply made up the word.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen vehemently denied that he used the N-word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story and his comments and assertions in there are completely false,&rdquo; Mr. Allen said during an interview with AP reporters and editors. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember ever using that word, and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Shelton said Mr. Allen used the N-word only around white teammates.</p>
<p>Dr. Shelton said the incident with the deer head occurred during their college days when he, Mr. Allen, and another teammate who has since died were hunting on a farm the third man&rsquo;s family owned near Bumpass, Va., 40 miles east of the university.</p>
<p>Dr. Shelton said Mr. Allen asked the other teammate where black families lived in the area, then stuffed a deer&rsquo;s head into the mailbox of one of the homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George insisted on taking the severed head, and I was a little shocked by that,&rdquo; he told the AP. &ldquo;This was just after the movie &lsquo;The Godfather&rsquo; came out with the severed horse&rsquo;s head in the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Shelton said he came forward because of Mr. Allen&rsquo;s presidential prospects and the &ldquo;macaca&rdquo; incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw the look in his eye in that camera and using the word &lsquo;macaca,&rsquo; it just brought back the bullying way I knew from George back then,&rdquo; he said.</p>
