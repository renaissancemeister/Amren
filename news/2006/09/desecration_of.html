<h1><a href="https://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGBMJ9AX3SE.html">Desecration Of Grave Linked To Religious Ritual</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keith Morelli, Tampa Tribune, September 15, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tampa &mdash; A grieving widow who visited her husband&rsquo;s grave expected to find fresh sod and flowers, not a ritualistic slaughter of animals next to the headstone.</p>
<p>But atop the two-week-old grave was a dead chicken, a set of goat hoofs and four dead puppies.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the puppies were headless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was horrified,&rdquo; said the woman, who asked not to be identified because she wanted to shield her family from the desecration.</p>
<p>Hillsborough County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies were called and filed a report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appeared to be a part of a religious practice,&rdquo; the responding deputy wrote in the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mozella Mitchell, professor and chairwoman of the department of religious studies at the University of South Florida, teaches African and Caribbean religions. She said the incident sounds like a Caribbean or African religious rite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does sound like it was very ritualistic,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;like they were making a sacrifice of some sort. These kinds of artifacts, chickens and goats, are often used in rituals. They may be seeking communication with spirits and sacrifice the blood of animals to a particular deity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mitchell said the blood sacrifices have their roots in Yoruba, an African religion that spread through the Caribbean over the past three centuries. Blood sacrifices are a way to reach the spirit world, she said.</p>
<p>The Bay area has a large contingent of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean, she said. Many practice this type of faith, although most keep it secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are afraid of ostracism and persecution,&rdquo; Mitchell said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to tell how many practice, because they do it undercover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santeria is a hybrid of religions, including Roman Catholicism and African Yoruba.Experts say it began in Cuba when African-born slaves, forced to worship as Catholics, blended that with their own beliefs.</p>
<p>Voodoo is a religion practiced mainly in the Caribbean, particularly in Haiti, and is based on West African spiritual traditions that also incorporate elements of Catholicism.</p>
<p>In Florida, Santeria blossomed in 1980, when the Mariel boatlift brought 125,000 Cubans to the state&rsquo;s southern shores. Many practiced Santeria, and it has grown with the influx of immigrants from Haiti and Jamaica.</p>
<p>The desecration is the second graveyard incident in the past few months. In July, the remains of a 6-year-old boy &mdash; buried 30 years ago &mdash; were stolen by grave robbers. The case has stumped police, who said the culprits probably were voodoo or Santeria practitioners, although religious experts doubted that.<br>
