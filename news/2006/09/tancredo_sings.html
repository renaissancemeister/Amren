<p>Congressman Addresses Hate Group<br>

Anne C. Mulkern, Denver Post, September 13, 2006</p>
<p>Finally, here is how Mr. Tancredo&rsquo;s opponent in the forthcoming election spins the story about &ldquo;our racist embarrassment for a representative&rdquo;:<br>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s help [Anne Mulkern] prove that Tancredo is a racist bigot and help Bill Winter win in November!&rdquo;<br>
WinterforCongress.com, September 16, 2006</p>
<hr>
<p>The expression is &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t just whistling Dixie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo wasn&rsquo;t whistling. He was singing Dixie. He was also standing in a Columbia, S.C., museum room with Confederate flags and a picture of Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tancredo spoke to a crowd that included the League of the South, a secessionist organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center calls a bigoted hate group. The league now embraces Tancredo&rsquo;s stands on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>It is &ldquo;highly possible&rdquo; that members of the South Carolina Council of Conservative Citizens also were on hand for Tancredo&rsquo;s speech, a local chapter spokesman told me. The CofCC has staged  demonstrations for the enforcement-only immigration reform Tancredo backs.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the council a hate group, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t have to grow up, as I did, amidst an American apartheid of separate public schools and separate public pools to see that the Rebel flag, Dixie and their supporters tear Americans apart.</p>
<p>When Tancredo pleads immunity from all this, it&rsquo;s a wink and a nod. By demonizing illegal immigration, Tancredo has empowered and enjoyed the support of Mexican-hating xenophobes. Now, he has added the progeny of the Confederacy, whose ancestors backed slavery and racial segregation. Tancredo insists he doesn&rsquo;t share their bigotry. But the people he attracts help define him.</p>
<p>What Tancredo did is like Hillary Clinton appearing with a hammer-and-sickle flag, talking socialized medicine to an audience that includes Communists, then singing the Russian national anthem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richard Hines booked the room at the request of Roan Garcia-Quintana, executive director of Americans Have Had Enough Coalition, which sponsored Tancredo&rsquo;s speech and whose board includes one of Tancredo&rsquo;s ex-Congressional staffers. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hines took care of his reputation in July 1996 in Richmond, Va. With a small group displaying Confederate flags, Hines protested putting a statue of black tennis star Arthur Ashe on a street that, Hines wrote to the Washington Post, &ldquo;was designated as a memorial to the Confederacy and those who served her. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP still battles South Carolina over its display of the Confederate flag. &ldquo;Their BS is that the flag reminds them of slavery,&rdquo; South Carolina Council of Conservative Citizens spokesman Kyle Rogers told me. He talked about the NAACP &ldquo;busing in welfare mothers to demonstrate in front of the statehouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garcia-Quintana admitted that the Confederate flag and the song Dixie symbolize hate to some and heritage to others. But in this case, he said, guys like me are being used by Republicans to stop a Tancredo White House run.</p>
<p>No, countered CofCC national spokesman Gordon Baum. Guys like me are used being used by the Southern Poverty Law Center to smear the right wing.</p>
<p>Wrong and wrong. Growing up, guys like me were used in racist social experiments run by people who believed in the Confederate flag and Dixie. Those people meant to convince kids that whites were better than blacks. That&rsquo;s why guys like me avoid symbols of racial prejudice.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://countenance.wordpress.com/2006/09/12/">It&rsquo;s News To Them, Not To Me</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Anthony Boor, St. Louis CofCC Blog, September 12th, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Right Wing News, a slightly conservative blog linked to from our blogroll, has discovered something we have known all along:</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center plays fast and loose with the truth.</p>
<p>The whole rub is that the SPLC is whining that U.S. Represenative Tom Tancredo (R-CO) attended a League of the South (&rdquo;Extremist hate group&rdquo; &mdash; SPLC jargon &mdash; Read: The K-People are out to get us, give us money so we can stop them) fundraiser. However, RWN reports that the fundraiser was really held by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Though the SPLC does not classify the SCV has an EHG, it worries that the SCV is being &ldquo;hijacked by EHGs&rdquo; (read: The K-People are out to get us, give us money so we can stop them).</p>
<p>This is only one more piece of paper in the big fat hopper of SPLC malfeasance. The good part about these stories is that, if anyone is ever on the opposite side of the SPLC in a court of law, these and other similar stories can be used to eviscerate the SPLC&rsquo;s credibility in front of a jury.</p>
<p>Morris Dees is a lawyer, and their other two principals, Mark Potok and Heidi Beirich, while they may or may not be lawyers, the latter has a Doctorate degree, and I would presume that anyone who holds any kind of Doctorate degree would know enough about the law. Why the SPLC plays so fast and loose with the truth and plays figurative Russian Roulette with its credibility is a mystery, but even if they go oh-for-a million in court, it won&rsquo;t matter, because the fools that write Morris Dees checks in fear of the K-People rounding them up are too paranoid ever to stop doing so.</p>
<p>UPDATE 9/13/2006:  As it turns out, the event hosted by the SCV wasn&rsquo;t a political fundraiser at all.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been, if the SCV wants to remain square with the law, as the SCV is a 501-c-3.  The event was simply a political rally, which featured Confederate Flags prominently displayed, and this blogmeister has confirmed with credible sources that Tancredo was there.  But this means the SPLC got it wrong on TWO counts &mdash; it was NOT LoS, and NOT a fundraiser. </p>
