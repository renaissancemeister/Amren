<h1>Radical Muslim Who Made Death Threats Against Pope Escapes Prosecution</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (UK), September 29, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A furious row has erupted after it emerged that a notorious preacher will not be prosecuted for issuing a death threat to Pope Benedict over his remarks about Islam.</p>
<p>During an organised demonstration, Muslim radical Anjem Choudary said that anyone who insulted Prophet Mohammed would be &lsquo;subject to capital punishment&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He made his remarks in a TV interview while protesting at the rally.</p>
<p>The protest took place outside the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral at the height of the furore over the Pope&rsquo;s quoting of a 14th century emperor who said the Prophet brought &lsquo;things only evil and inhuman&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Police received about 25 complaints about the protest which left members of the central London Cathedral&rsquo;s congregation &lsquo;upset&rsquo; and &lsquo;intimidated&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But Scotland Yard has concluded that &lsquo;no substantive offences&rsquo; were committed on September 17.</p>
<p>The force has also decided that lawyer Choudary&rsquo;s comments, which actually came in a media interview rather, did not constitute an offence.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair told the Metropolitan Police Authority his officers were trying to &lsquo;hold the line of free speech&rsquo; in an &lsquo;angry time&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Met can only police the law as it stands,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No substantive offences were discovered during that demonstration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remarks by one person that were widely printed in the media did not take place at the demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, who demanded action against Choudary, said: &ldquo;My reaction is that it is quite disgraceful that Sir Ian Blair is not taking action over this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sends out a message to Muslim extremists across the world that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are likely to become more and more outspoken because it is apparent that we do not have the courage to stand up to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel Whittaker, a Tory member of the MPA, had earlier described in the meeting how members of the congregation &lsquo;felt intimidated&rsquo; and &lsquo;were upset&rsquo; by the protest.</p>
<p>Others even felt &lsquo;threatened&rsquo; she said, describing the demonstration as: &ldquo;An appalling misuse of the freedom of speech&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, Sir Ian said: &ldquo;The Cathedral authorities expressed complete satisfaction with the police operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are living in an angry time. It is the job of the Metropolitan Police to hold the line of free speech and it is a difficult line to hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in this particular case I am satisfied there were no offences committed by anybody.&rsquo; However Sir Ian&rsquo;s comments have sparked further confusion.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said that its lawyers were still reviewing TV footage from the day of the demo &mdash; leaving the door open for a prosecution.</p>
<p>About 100 Muslim demonstrators took part in the protest . Slogans on display included &lsquo;Pope go to hell&rsquo; and &lsquo;May Allah Curse The Pope&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the wake of the protest, Scotland Yard&rsquo;s Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, announced that officers would look to see if any criminal offences had been committed.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard officers also carried out an investigation after a demonstration outside the Danish embassy earlier this year over the controversial Muslim cartoons.</p>
<p>On that occasion, Choudary was fined Â£500 for failing to give police proper notice before the protest march in February. Other participants are awaiting trial.<br>
