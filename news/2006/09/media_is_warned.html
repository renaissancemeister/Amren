	<p>The British media needs to be more balanced in its coverage of Islam, according to members of Christian-Muslim dialogue groups. On the fifth anniversary of the atrocities of 9/11 in New York, suspicion of Islam in the UK is higher than ever, as shown in a recent YouGov poll in which 53 per cent of respondents felt they thought Islam was a threat to Western liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile 65 per cent of those surveyed said security services should focus anti-terrorism intelligence on Muslims. Ibrahim Mogra, chair of the interfaith relations committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, said the media in the UK too often presented a distorted view of the religion. He said: &ldquo;Not all of the media is bad but some sections present Islam in a very negative way which is not practised by the majority of Muslims in this country. &ldquo;The media should be going out and talking to mainstream and ordinary Muslims and presenting that to the nation, rather than a perverted view. &ldquo;How many Imams have we see on the front pages talking about compassion and love, there are hundreds of them.&rdquo; Mr Mogra added that he felt that 9/11 had led to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and that the media needed to ask more questions about British foreign policy, which he feels motivated the 7/7 bombers. Meanwhile, Julian Bond, Director of Management and Communications at the Christian Muslim Forum, said the media had to take more responsibility for its coverage. He said: &ldquo;I think the negative perceptions are there among many people in this country from all kinds of backgrounds. &ldquo;You can pick up a paper everyday and read something about Islam, sometimes positive but sometimes negative, such as the searching of the Islamic school at the moment. &ldquo;I think the media needs to think about the impact that their coverage has and try to be more even-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bond agreed that perceptions of Islam had got worse in the last five years since 9/11. He said: &ldquo;It has got more difficult because there&rsquo;s a real fear, which was heightened by 7/7 and what happened on the underground with the perpetrators all being Muslim. &ldquo;But that is a minority as the majority of Muslims are peacefully practising their religion and living normal lives.&rdquo; Mr Bond called for Christians to get to know Muslims so they could better understand them, by spending time together, sharing meals and even reading scripture together, despite their doctrinal differences.</p>
<p>He said it could be helpful for Christians to read the Koran to raise their awareness of Islam, and added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science. If we show an interest in Islamic people it&rsquo;s more likely they will show an interest in Christianity and we can build bridges.&rdquo; <br>

								<h2>Stereotyping Is Leading To Terror, Says First Muslim Miss England</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Daily Mail (UK), August 31, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The first Muslim to be crowned Miss England has warned that stereotyping members of her community is leading some towards extremism.</p>
<p>Hammasa Kohistani made history last year when she was chosen to represent England in the Miss World pageant.</p>
<p>But one year on, the 19-year-old student from Hounslow feels that winning the coveted beauty title last September was a &ldquo;sugar coating&rdquo; for Muslims who have become more alienated in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;The attitude towards Muslims has got worse over the year. Also the Muslims&rsquo; attitude to British people has got worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even moderate Muslims are turning to terrorism to prove themselves. They think they might as well support it because they are stereotyped anyway. It will take a long time for communities to start mixing in more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People may feel I am just a sugar coating on the situation. I am a symbol to show it&rsquo;s not really that bad.</p>
<p>But at the same time, she said, &ldquo;there is this hostility&rdquo; which comes &ldquo;mainly from the Government&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister told MPs last month that moderate Muslims were not doing enough to tackle extremists in their own community.</p>
<p>Miss Kohistani said: &ldquo;Tony Blair addressed Muslims in particular, telling them that they need to sort out the problem within. That was a huge stereotype of the Islamic community. Even the more moderate Muslims have been stereotyped negatively and feel they have to take actions to prove themselves.</p>
<p>Born in Uzbekistan and raised in Afghanistan, Miss Kohistani divided Muslim opinion when she entered and won the Miss England pageant in Liverpool.</p>
<p>Several community leaders openly declared her to be betraying the laws of Islam while radical Muslims sent the teenager and her family death threats.</p>
<p>But after a busy year travelling around the world as an ambassador for England, Miss Kohistani said she feels Muslims are unfairly being branded as terrorists.</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;For a Muslim to represent England is asking for controversy at the moment. I feel after everything that&rsquo;s happened Muslims are being stereotyped negatively. The whole community has been labelled and, whether they are guilty of crime or not, they are getting penalised for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like being in the limelight because people can look at me and see I am a Muslim but good. Most of the people being pinpointed are judged by their outer appearances and people assume because they are Muslim and have a beard they have done something wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued: &ldquo;The bridge I have made is slowly being broken by more and more wars. Now the Iran situation is brought up and another Islamic country is under scrutiny - and the recent Heathrow scare. I guess I am needed even more now than last year to an extent because of what has happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to answer how to get people to turn away from terrorism. The politicians don&rsquo;t know what to do and I am just a 19-year-old.&rdquo; </p>
