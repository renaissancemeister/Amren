<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Driver spent two nights in jail after being accused of &ldquo;revving his car in a racist manner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mechanic Ronnie Hutton, 49, yesterday described his court ordeal which finally ended when prosecutors dropped the allegation of racism.</p>
<p>But he was still convicted of a breach of the peace for revving the engine of his £25,000 Lotus.</p>
<p>Witnesses claimed he had been trying to intimidate a Libyan couple on the pavement. Ronnie, of Stirling, claims he was only revving the powerful V8 engine to avoid another £15,000 repair bill.</p>
<p>But off-duty Chief Inspector Eoin Jenkins thought he was targeting Muslim Isam Maigel and his wife Hana Saad.</p>
<p>And when Jenkins, now retired, confronted Ronnie he was told to &ldquo;f*** off&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Thursday, at Stirling Sheriff court, the Crown ditched the racist part of the charge but Sheriff Andrew Cubie convicted Ronnie of breach of the peace and fined him £150.</p>
<p>Last night, he said: &ldquo;To be convicted for revving my car in a busy street is hard to take. Does this mean anyone driving a noisy car in Scotland is now a criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the row last September, police officers arrived at Ronnie&rsquo;s home and asked him to come with them to talk about the incident. He ended up being kept in a cell for two nights before being taken to court where he was released without charge.</p>
<p>He complained to the fiscal and the new charges surfaced months later. He said: &ldquo;The police kept me in custody over the weekend because I made the mistake of swearing at a senior officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In court, Mr Maigel, 28, then a student at Stirling Uni, said: &ldquo;The driver came alongside and was trying to annoy us by revving his engine very, very loudly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using an interpreter, Hana Saad, 23, said he had degraded them &ldquo;maybe because we are Muslim&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ronnie claims he was only trying to prevent the repeat of a engine problem had had suffered earlier with the Esprit.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had problems with the Lotus since I bought it. I paid £15,000 for a new engine in 2003.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I started the car the oil pressure light wouldn&rsquo;t go out. I accept I revved the engine - it&rsquo;s a V8 twin turbo and is noisy and frightening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would openly apologise to this couple. I am not a racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is now considering an appeal against his conviction - and also plans to sell the Lotus. He said: &ldquo;It has been nothing but trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He tried to annoy us by revving his engine very loudly&rsquo; Isam Maigel <br>

						<p>
							<i>Daily Record (UK), 20 September 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>HIBS and Hearts stars have joined forces as part of a campaign to give racism the boot.</p>
<p>Both sets of players will hold up red cards before the first Edinburgh derby of the season kicks off at Easter Road on October 15.</p>
<p>Stars from across the football divide met at the City Chambers in Edinburgh yesterday at the launch of the Show Racism the Red Card action plan.</p>
<p>Hibs midfielder Michael Stewart joined Hearts players Jose Conclaves and Andy Diver as plans were announced to contact pupils from 32 primary schools across Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The initiative has already been launched in Glasgow and the anti-racism message will be spread across the country.</p>
<p>Former Celtic player Gerry Britton has taken on the role as educational co-ordinator.</p>
<p>Gerry said:&rdquo;It&rsquo;s great that we&rsquo;re establishing strong links with Edinburgh city council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to tackle the problem of racism and educating the school children is a good place to start. It is important for the big clubs to be pro-active.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Racism is a bigger problem at grassroots level in football and we have to look at the reasons for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Stewart said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to be asked along to help out.&rdquo; </p>
