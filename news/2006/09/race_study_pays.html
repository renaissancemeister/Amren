<h1>Race Study Pays Off In Genius Grant</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Herman, Chicago Sun-Times, September 19, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Genius has its rewards. Just ask Jennifer Richeson.</p>
<p>The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation awarded Richeson a $500,000 &ldquo;genius grant&rdquo; Monday. The coveted grant comes in recognition of her work in the psychology of racial bias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite real. I&rsquo;m totally in the land of the surreal,&rdquo; said Richeson, an associate professor of psychology at Northwestern University.</p>
<p>Richeson&rsquo;s work is firmly grounded in reality. With techniques including surveys and MRI brain imaging, she studies interactions between races, shattering traditional views of how people think and feel about race.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation created the grants in 1981. Officially, the program is called the MacArthur Fellowship. But foundation officials concede the &ldquo;genius grant&rdquo; label, created by the media, has stuck.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richeson will &ldquo;spend a little bit of time thinking&rdquo; about the issue that has captivated her since her college days: The complexity of racial feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stuff isn&rsquo;t straightforward&hellip; It isn&rsquo;t just a question of who and who is not a bigot,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>For example, Richeson&rsquo;s work has shown that well-meaning whites work to repress bigoted feelings when dealing with people of other races. Brain scans show &ldquo;heightened activity in areas of the brain associated with regulating our thoughts and emotions,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>That effort leads to &ldquo;awkwardness&rdquo; and &ldquo;exhaustion&rdquo; in social interactions, she said, and could lead to depleted ability to perform other tasks.</p>
<p>Richeson grew up in Baltimore and attended public schools. She became interested in race relations while in college at Brown University, which was &ldquo;a sea of whiteness&rdquo; filled with wealthy kids, she said.</p>
<p>After getting a doctorate at Harvard University, Richeson taught at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., before coming to Northwestern last year.</p>
<p>As for the money, Richeson has no plans to take a sabbatical from Northwestern, she said. She said she will devote her efforts to &ldquo;the mission of improving intergroup interaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richeson concludes that well-meaning white people repress bigoted feelings when dealing with other races. The effort leads to &ldquo;awkwardness&rdquo; and &ldquo;exhaustion&rdquo; in social interactions, Richeson said in a recent Chicago Sun-Times interview.</p>
<p>In other words if you&rsquo;re a non-white person and get stressed out when you are confronted by what you consider to be racist behavior, you can take comfort in knowing that a lot of whites apparently get just as stressed out trying not to be a bigot. That goes to show you, if we are ever going to improve race relations in our lifetime, many more of us will have to want to work through our barriers.</p>
