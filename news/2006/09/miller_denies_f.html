<h1>Miller Denies Financing March</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Romell, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 1, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Miller Brewing Co. on Friday denied providing financial help for a planned march in Chicago supporting illegal immigrants, but a newspaper report of the firm&rsquo;s involvement in a controversial political issue could create marketing headaches for the Milwaukee brewer.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune reported that Miller had paid more than $30,000 for &ldquo;a planning convention, materials and newspaper ads&rdquo; connected to this weekend&rsquo;s &ldquo;Immigrant Workers Justice Walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not so, Miller spokesman Peter J. Marino said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money supported a recent convention on immigration issues in Chicago, which provided attendees with information on how to become legally naturalized citizens of the U.S.,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Miller isn&rsquo;t sponsoring the march and didn&rsquo;t authorize use of its trademarks in association with the event, Marino said. The Tribune reported that advertisements for the march bear Miller&rsquo;s logo.</p>
<p>The 40-mile walk is to go from Chicago&rsquo;s Chinatown neighborhood to the Batavia, Ill. office of House Speaker Dennis Hastert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are asking him to pay attention to the contributions of undocumented immigrants, and to pass immigration reform that allows for legalization for all; family reunification and civil liberties protection,&rdquo; says the Web site of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, one of the groups organizing the march.</p>
<p>Marino said Miller supports reform of immigration law, but not illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Corporations typically seek to avoid political controversies, but Miller may be forced to dance along a fine line on Latino immigration.</p>
<p>With their numbers in the U.S. growing rapidly and a relatively young population, Latinos are a prime target for brewers. In October 2004, Miller said it planned to spend $100 million over three years on marketing via Spanish-language media, a major increase for the company.</p>
<p>Latinos are &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; important to Miller, said Benj Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer&rsquo;s Insights.</p>
<p>And Miller recently had to deal with a boycott threat from an umbrella group of Midwestern Latino community organizations upset that Miller&rsquo;s political action committee had made $2,000 in campaign contributions to U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), sponsor of an immigration bill the group viewed as too harsh.</p>
<p>The boycott was quickly canceled after the two sides met in Chicago, and Miller agreed to run newspaper ads against the bill and help the group fight it.</p>
<p>Steinman said getting involved in the immigration question was chancy, and pointed to criticism of Miller already appearing Friday on Internet blogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just such a controversial issue that when a corporation takes a side, you risk alienating the other side,&rdquo; Steinman said.</p>
