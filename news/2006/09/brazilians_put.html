<h1>Brazilians Put New Swing Into Small Irish Town</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Hoskins, Reuters, September 25, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gort &mdash; Brazilian flags hang from pubs, posters in Portuguese advertise the agricultural fair and the vibrant green-and-yellow paintwork of the &lsquo;Real Brazil&rsquo; food store stands out in a drab row of shops.</p>
<p>Tucked between western Ireland&rsquo;s stark Burren region and Slieve Aughty mountains, Gort is fast becoming the country&rsquo;s very own &lsquo;Little Brazil&rsquo; with a Latin American community that now accounts for over a third of the 3,000-strong population.</p>
<p>Even in the capital Dublin, where growing Polish and Chinese communities are beginning to make their mark, there is nothing to match this rural town&rsquo;s vivid illustration of the demographic changes being fueled by Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Celtic Tiger&rsquo; economic boom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now a flagship for other communities on how integration should work,&rdquo; said Adrian Feeney, chairman of the town&rsquo;s chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>On a rainy morning in Gort&rsquo;s main square, around 70 Brazilian men wait to be hired by farmers and builders. Few speak English, and they shout to each other in Portuguese.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FLAGS &amp; PAINTED FACES</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Gort, however, the workers have come from the other side of the planet and the town is developing a distinctly Latin American feel with its &lsquo;Samba Celtic&rsquo; soccer club, church services in Portuguese and an annual &lsquo;Quadrilha&rsquo; carnival.</p>
<p>Ireland&rsquo;s absence from this year&rsquo;s soccer World Cup finals did little to prevent the sports shop doing a roaring trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was brilliant, huge,&rdquo; said 17-year-old John Moylan Jnr. who is minding the family store. He estimates they sold up to 300 Brazil strips and 100 flags during the tournament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The immigrant population has mushroomed since half a dozen Brazilians first arrived to work in the meat processing plant. The owner sought workers from Brazil, the world&rsquo;s largest beef exporter, because of a local shortage of skilled labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good workers, the best workers, and they don&rsquo;t create any trouble,&rdquo; said Moylan Jnr.</p>
<p>On the town&rsquo;s Web site, only two out of 10 anonymous comments on the Brazilian community are negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how lucky you are to have people who are noted the world over for their friendliness and hospitality,&rdquo; reads one response to concerns over the dilution of Irish culture.</p>
<p>When fumes from a heater killed two Brazilian men in their beds last year, the town rallied round with a fundraising campaign that has so far paid for two houses for their families back in Brazil and a fund to provide them with an income.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank Murray, a Portuguese-speaking Scot working in Gort for a community project run by the National University of Ireland in Galway, says many locals feel empathy toward the newcomers partly because of Ireland&rsquo;s long history of economic migration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the older people have found it difficult to see their town change so much so fast and there may be some underlying resentment but it&rsquo;s brought the town alive again,&rdquo; Murray said.</p>
<p>For the Brazilians, the first months can be tough, he added. &ldquo;Brazilians are a bit like Guinness, they don&rsquo;t travel well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, more and more are opting to stay for longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They love the Irish, they think they&rsquo;re so well-mannered, but the biggest thing is the lack of violence which, for all the great things in Brazil, is certainly hanging over you there,&rdquo; Murray said.</p>
<p>Emerging from the &ldquo;Real Brazil&rdquo; convenience store next door, Marelene Xavier di Paula says there are some problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes people have difficulty about their English and people have some difficulties about jobs &mdash; the men can go for construction but the women only clean,&rdquo; said the greengrocer&rsquo;s assistant whose 15-year-old son attends the local school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brendan Smith, who teaches computer skills to the Brazilians as part of the university outreach project, puts the integration success down to a healthy gender and age mix and a lack of ghettoisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s important because otherwise you get a situation like in France: a ticking time bomb,&rdquo; he said, referring to last year&rsquo;s riots in French cities by youths, many of them descendants of immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens when the economy turns down? That&rsquo;s a question all of Ireland will have to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, Smith believes the Brazilian influx is benefiting everyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a symbiotic relationship, the two sides feed off each other. Gort was a sleepy backwater before. It needed a buzz and they&rsquo;ve supplied that buzz.&rdquo; </p>
