<h1>Britons Threaten Muslim Beheadings In Footage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Foggo, The Australian, September 4, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Far-Right extremists have adopted the tactics of Islamic jihadis by posting videos on the internet in which they threaten to behead British Muslims.</p>
<p>The films show balaclava-clad white British men brandishing guns, knives and clubs, calling on all Muslims to leave Britain or be killed. One appears to be a soldier who has served in the Gulf. </p>
<p>In one film, a man tells Muslims to &ldquo;go home&rdquo; or risk being burned alive. He threatens, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut your head off&rdquo;, and claims to have &ldquo;comrades&rdquo; across Britain who have &ldquo;had enough&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The videos were made after the arrests three weeks ago of suspects connected to the alleged plot to blow up trans-Atlantic jets. Their style mimics the &ldquo;martyrdom videos&rdquo; of Islamic radicals. </p>
<p>The release of the videos on YouTube, a US-based open-access website, coincides with reports of a rise in the number of attacks on mosques. </p>
<p>Massoud Shadjareh, chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, said the videoed threats were extremely worrying. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no question there has been an increase in attacks on mosques and Muslims,&rdquo; he said at the weekend. </p>
<p>The videos, posted between August 11 and 19, depict three men, each wearing a black terrorist-style mask. </p>
<p>Would-be viewers of the clips, lasting two to three minutes, are told in a YouTube warning the videos &ldquo;may contain content that is inappropriate for some users&rdquo;. </p>
<p>In one video, a man with a London accent says: &ldquo;I wish to know what we are going to do to fight the so-called religion of peace known as Islam.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He lists incidents including the racially motivated murder of Ross Parker, a white teenager, on September 21, 2001. The alleged airline bomb plot is also mentioned, with the masked man claiming it has resulted in &ldquo;no retaliation&rdquo; against Muslims. </p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;It may be because you fear prison. Well, wake up. I am calling on England, Ulster, Scotland and Wales to stand and defend the island that we love.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Another video, dated August 19, shows a balaclava-clad man with a Welsh accent telling Muslims to &ldquo;go home&rdquo; or be burned. </p>
<p>Brandishing a 30cm-long hunting knife with a serrated blade, he says: &ldquo;We are going to rip the life out of you. I am going to tear your guts out. I&rsquo;ll cut your head off.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In a reference that may indicate a military background, he says the slaughter would remind him of being &ldquo;back in the Gulf&rdquo;. </p>
