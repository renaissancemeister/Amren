<h1><a href="https://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060831immigration.shtml">&lsquo;Take Risks On Immigration And Asylum&rsquo; Churches Told</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>www.ekklesia.co.uk, August 31, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The general secretary of the World Council of Churches (WCC) has urged Christians to take risks when it comes to care for immigrants and asylum seekers. </p>
<p>In a volatile global context, the massive migration of people around the world has a deep impact on societies and churches, and poses fundamental questions for ecumenical relationships and responsibility, he said in his report to the organization&rsquo;s main governing body.</p>
<p>His call comes at a time when churches in the UK are <a href="https://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_050322.shtml">increasingly challenging Government policy </a>in this area, and <a href="https://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_04111mck.shtml">a Catholic priest risked jail </a>to defend the rights of one asylum seeker. </p>
<p>Migration &ldquo;is one of the main features of the changing global context, with decisive consequences for the ecumenical movement locally and globally,&rdquo; Rev. Dr Samuel Kobia noted in his opening address to the WCC&rsquo;s central committee, meeting in Geneva 30 August-6 September 2006.</p>
<p>The UN estimates that over 175 million people are on the move worldwide, and the trend is growing as economic globalization, civil conflicts and transport links transform traditional societies.</p>
<p>In the face of such complex change, churches in all places are called to live out the biblical ideal of hospitality towards the stranger and accepting change, Kobia said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s world, welcoming strangers is a justice issue, and often a political statement,&rdquo; Kobia underlined. &ldquo;Practising true hospitality involves recognizing our own vulnerability and being open to transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standing with migrants is politically unpopular in most regions of the world. The risks are very real, yet so is our calling,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In his report, Kobia also outlined proposals for a new ecumenical initiative in response to the Middle East conflicts, which he termed &ldquo;the greatest of challenges&rdquo; to the international community. Kobia&rsquo;s proposal centres on the establishment of a new Palestine/Israel Ecumenical Forum to strengthen the coordination of strategy, resources and actions of churches and related organizations in the region. The Middle East is expected to be a central focus of the committee&rsquo;s discussions.</p>
<p>The WCC central committee gathers 150 church representatives from all regions and church traditions, and has the oversight of the Council&rsquo;s policy and programmes. </p>
<p>The full text of Kobia&rsquo;s report is available on the WCC website </p>
