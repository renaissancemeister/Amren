Nicole Gaouette, Los Angeles Times, September 1, 2006 </p>
<hr>
<p>Advocates of immigration yesterday announced a rally in the District to &ldquo;welcome back&rdquo; members of Congress, who are expected to resume a heated debate about U.S. policy on illegal aliens. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are unrelenting in our efforts to get comprehensive immigration reform passed,&rdquo; said Germonique Jones, a spokeswoman for the Center for Community Change, based in the District. </p>
<p>The rally Thursday on the Mall will call on lawmakers to pass legislation helping illegal aliens achieve legal status and ending deportations that split families. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make sure that right before elections [lawmakers] understand that immigrants are paying attention to the debate, and we want action from Congress and not just lip service,&rdquo; said Jaime Contreras, president of the National Capital Immigration Coalition, which organized the event. &ldquo;We want solutions.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One of the speakers will be Bruce S. Gordon, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. </p>
<p>Protesters will march past the Capitol to the White House. </p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to wear white and discouraged from carrying foreign flags. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miss Jones said the rally Thursday will reflect an outreach to the black, Asian, African and Muslim communities. It also will draw on the energy created by the election season. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting down to the wire &hellip; and I think that&rsquo;s going to play out in the tenor of the marches,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Camp Democracy, an effort led by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, also will hold a rally Thursday that will include a vigil for illegal aliens who died attempting to enter the United States. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Metro will run trains at more frequent intervals starting at 2 p.m., and is providing rally organizers with 20,000 Spanish-language pocket guides. </p>
<p>To alleviate crowding at subway stations, Metro will add staff, sell fare cards by hand at the D.C. Stadium-Armory and other stations, make some service announcements in Spanish and place temporary Spanish instructions on fare card machines. </p>
<p>Spokesman Steven Taubenkibel said Metro recorded 821,283 riders during the April 10 immigration rally on the Mall, the second-highest ridership in its 30-year history. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We advise customers to plan accordingly, possibly stagger their work times as to when they leave, be prepared for heavier volumes on the railway system and avoid transferring trains if possible,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Similar demonstrations will be held Monday in Phoenix and Sept. 9 in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Today, about 100,000 people in Chicago are expected to begin a four-day march to the office of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Illinois Republican. </p>
