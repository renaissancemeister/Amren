			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Stossel and Kristina Kendall, ABC News, September 20, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Giving your kid a unique name is the hot new thing in Hollywood. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their firstborn Apple. Jason Lee gave his son the name Pilot Inspektor  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s not a misspelling, it&rsquo;s spelled with a &ldquo;k.&rdquo; Earlier this month, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes posed for Vanity Fair with their uniquely named daughter, Suri.</p>
<p>Unusual names &mdash; like Shabita and Shakira &mdash; are also big in the black community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty percent of black baby girls in a given year in California have a name that no one else has,&rdquo; said Roland Fryer, an economist and assistant professor at Harvard University, who has taken a special interest in uniquely black names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White names tend to be things like Molly,&rdquo; Fryer said. &ldquo;We had 16 million names in California. We only had six black Mollys and not one white Lakisha. Some of the blacker names tend to be things like Aida. Reginald is a very black name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This matters because studies of resumes have found that people with black-sounding names are less likely to get callbacks.</p>
<p>Putting Names to the Test</p>
<p>In 2004, &ldquo;20/20&rdquo; brought together a group of young black professionals who doubted that the black-sounding names on their resumes made a difference. We put 22 pairs of names to the test, posting identical resumes, with the only difference being the name.</p>
<p>Since the content of the resumes was identical, it would make sense that they&rsquo;d get the same attention. However, the resumes with the white-sounding names were actually downloaded 17 percent more often by job recruiters than the resumes with black-sounding names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really never know why you don&rsquo;t get called back for that interview. I thought it&rsquo;s because of my job skills. But I never thought it was because of my name,&rdquo; said Tremelle, a participant in the study.</p>
<p>Jack Daniel, a professor of communication at the University of Pittburgh, has done research that shows both white and black children prefer white-sounding names.</p>
<p>Daniel asked a group of 4- and 5-year-old children a series of questions. The children were asked to answer the questions based solely on names. For example, &ldquo;Who is the smartest, Sarah or Shaniqua?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; one boy answered.</p>
<p>Daniel asked, &ldquo;Who would you like to play with, Tanisha or Megan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Megan,&rdquo; another child said.</p>
<p>Daniel asked, &ldquo;Who took the bite out of your sandwich? Do you think it was Adam or Jamal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another boy said, &ldquo;Jamal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inferring From a Name</p>
<p>Why do we discriminate based on names? It may not be about race but instead what some names signal about a person&rsquo;s background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A distinctively black name tells us that a person typically comes from a neighborhood that has higher poverty, lower income, more likely to have teen mothers, et cetera,&rdquo; Fryer said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new research that shows names may even tell us about more than just social background; a name may affect future decisions about marriage and career.</p>

<p>Avoiding Bad Names</p>
<p>Pelham says names can have a negative impact, as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin Dinky &mdash; not going to become the CEO of a major corporation,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>So should parents steer away from being clever when naming their children?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advice to parents: It might seem cool to give your kid a unique name. But there are many, many more disadvantages to doing that than advantages,&rdquo; Pelham said.</p>
