<h1>Radio Show Helps Fuel Flag Controversy</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Freeport &mdash; Velasco Elementary School&rsquo;s principal said he has been taken aback by a controversy that has arisen from his campus&rsquo; Mexican Independence Day celebration, and he apologizes for offending parents.</p>
<p>During a short school assembly Friday, several parent volunteers read a pledge of allegiance to the Mexican flag. Since a parent complained on the Chris Baker show on NewsRadio 740 KTRH that afternoon, the issue has become a focal point of some Houston talk radio shows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been overwhelming,&rdquo; said longtime Principal Sam Williams. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a real trying ordeal and all I can say is I deeply apologize if anyone was offended by it &mdash; and I can see that they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In hindsight, he said, the program should have been presented differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had it to do all over again, we would revamp it,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that we would repeat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Velasco Elementary has 635 students in prekindergarten through fourth grade, 65 percent of whom are Hispanic. Williams, who is black, has served as principal of the school for 18 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have stated in our mission statement that we are a campus that is a beacon of hope for a culturally diverse population,&rdquo; Williams said.</p>
<p>At about 10 a.m. Friday, students and parents gathered in the gym for an assembly commemorating Diez y Seis de Septiembre, Sept. 16, when Mexico celebrates its independence from Spain. The school&rsquo;s bilingual classes from different grade levels performed songs, Williams said. Everyone was given a small Mexican flag and a group of six or seven parents recited the pledge from a script, Williams said. The students did not recite it, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My students don&rsquo;t even know the Mexican pledge,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;In the minds of my little kids here at the elementary school &hellip; they were simply holding a flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the audience did stand as a sign of respect because that is the custom with which students are familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we normally do is we stand for any pledge that&rsquo;s given,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They can only relate to the U.S. pledge and the Texas pledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baker continued talking about the incident during his radio show Tuesday afternoon. He criticized the principal for allowing anyone to recite a pledge to the Mexican flag in the midst of a national debate over illegal immigration. He also called for the principal&rsquo;s demotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To blow it off as quote-unquote &lsquo;historical teaching methods&rsquo; either shows complete arrogance or a lack of the ability to grasp the seriousness of the illegal immigration issue to Americans,&rdquo; Baker said at the beginning of his show.</p>
<p>The audio of Baker&rsquo;s broadcast is stored online at www.ktrh.com. According to the recording, on Friday a woman who said her name was Amy called in about the assembly at her daughter&rsquo;s school. She claimed everyone there was asked to pledge allegiance to the Mexican flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the sensitivity to the country and to the troops and the men and women that have fought and died for this country?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The woman said her husband served three tours of duty in Vietnam and she has a son in the war now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We absolutely refuse to stand up and pledge allegiance to another country&rsquo;s flag,&rdquo; she said.</p>
