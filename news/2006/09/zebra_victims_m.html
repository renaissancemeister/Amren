<h1>Zebra Victims Memorial Services, Friday October 20, 2006 12:00 Noon</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>European/American Issues Forum, September 5, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Tenth Annual Zebra Victims Memorial Services are scheduled for Friday, October 20, 2006, at 12:00 Noon to 1:00 PM on the Plaza Side steps of San Francisco&rsquo;s City Hall.</p>
<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s first African American Chief of Police Prentice Earl Sanders, Ret., has written a just released book on the Zebra case titled &#8220;Zebra Murders&#8221; along with Bennett Cohen. Chief Sanders has been invited to attend the Memorial Services. Mayor Gavin Newsom and many City dignitaries have also been invited, including the print, radio and news media.</p>
<p>We are providing this notice to family members of the Zebra victims who have expressed interest in attending the Memorial Service. In the interest of protecting their privacy we are sending this e-mail to each of you individually. We are also sending this notice to others who may have interest in attending the Memorial Services.</p>
<p>We respectfully invite all interested police officers, friends and family members, and would hope that they would be willing to publicly express their concern that the Zebra victims have essentially been forgotten by the City of San Francisco as though they had committed some wrong by being victims. </p>
<p>The pain of those tragic events remains with those who were victims and, thank God, lived, and with all of the family members and friends who were so deeply affected. </p>
<p>We will go to lunch following the Memorial Services at a nearby restaurant. Please pass this announcement on to others you think may be interested.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Lou Calabro, <br>
President E/AIF<br>
