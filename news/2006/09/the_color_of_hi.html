<h1><a href="https://www.nysun.com/article/40050?access=626537">The Color Of His Skin</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Mcwhorter, New York Sun, September 21, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Imagine him white.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, that is. Amidst all the glowing talk about the possibility of his becoming America&rsquo;s first black president in 2008, it&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment to imagine whether Mr. Obama would elicit this swooning buzz if he were white.</p>
<p>That is, let&rsquo;s imagine a white guy with all of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s pluses: crinkly smile, sincere concern for the little man, fine speech a couple of years ago about bringing the nation together, a certain charisma, wrote a touching autobiography. Let&rsquo;s call him Barrett O&rsquo;Leary.</p>
<p>I do not think Mr. O&rsquo;Leary would be touted a year-and-change into his Senate appointment as a presidential possibility. No knock on Mr. Obama intended, mind you. For all we know, he could have the genius for national statesmanship of a Disraeli. The point is that we don&rsquo;t know yet. Like any new senator, Mr. Obama has been quietly learning his way around the byzantine procedures of Senate lawmaking.</p>
<p>The key factor that galvanizes people around the idea of Obama for president is, quite simply, that he is black. Other things about him don&rsquo;t hurt, but that&rsquo;s all &mdash; they are not the deciding factor. Take away Mr. Obama&rsquo;s race and he&rsquo;s some relatively anonymous rookie. Barrett O&rsquo;Leary, even if as cute and articulate as Mr. Obama, would have to wait at least another four years, and possibly six or seven, before being considered as a possible commander in chief.</p>
<p>What gives people a jolt in their gut about the idea of President Obama is the idea that it would be a ringing symbol that racism no longer rules our land. President Obama might be, for instance, a substitute for that national apology for slavery that some consider so urgent. Surely a nation with a black president would be one no longer hung up on race.</p>
<p>Or not. Mr. Obama is being considered as presidential timber not despite his race, but because of it. That is, for all of its good intentions, a dehumanization of Mr. Obama. We&rsquo;re still hung up. What Mr. Obama has done is less important than his skin color and what it &ldquo;means.&rdquo; The content of our character is not exactly center stage here. We are a long way from Selma, but not yet where the Rev. King wanted us to be.</p>
<p>Another reason for my lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Obama as symbol is that the racial healing many might see him as portending would not happen. Among a certain kind of black person and non-black fellow travelers &mdash; roughly, those given to surmising that the levees near the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans were deliberately blown up &mdash; the going wisdom would be that Mr. Obama was elected only because he is merely the kind of black person whites are &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; with.</p>
<p>With his light skin, African father and white mother, and only faint hint of what I call a &ldquo;black-ccent&rdquo; &mdash; the subtle vocal quality that makes most black Americans identifiable as black over the phone (yes, one can &ldquo;sound black.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s been demonstrated repeatedly by linguistic analysis, and the &ldquo;black-ccent&rdquo; overlaps only partially with white Southern) &mdash; Mr. Obama would easily be cast by these types as &ldquo;not too black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kind of person these people see as &ldquo;really black&rdquo; are ones like, say, Spike Lee, who view white America warily as an alternate universe (Mr. Lee considers the levee-bombing a viable possibility, for example). </p>
