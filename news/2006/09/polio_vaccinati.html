<h1><a href="http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1356802006">Polio Vaccination Dismissed As Devil&rsquo;s Work Across Africa</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maria Cheng And John Alechenu, News.Scotsman.com, September 14, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kano, Nigeria &mdash; For Ramatu Garba, the polio vaccine is more curse than saviour &mdash; part of an evil conspiracy hatched in the West to sterilise Nigerian girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allah used Muslim scientists to expose the western plot of using polio vaccines to reduce our population,&rdquo; said the 28-year-old Muslim food vendor in the northern Nigerian town of Kano.</p>
<p>Each time health teams have tried to vaccinate her daughter, Ms Garba has refused.</p>
<p>Besides lack of funding, equipment and personnel, international health teams fighting disease in the world&rsquo;s poorest countries must also contend with rumours that spread through vulnerable populations and create barriers to urgent health campaigns that have saved millions of lives.</p>
<p>In Kenya, whispers were once rife that polio vaccine is a tool for devil worship. Across Africa, there is widespread belief that vaccines spread HIV.</p>
<p>The rumours in Kano started in 2003, when local politicians claimed polio vaccine contained anti-fertility agents and suspended vaccination for nearly a year. Since then, public-health authorities have been working desperately to convince the government and people like Ms Garba of the vaccine&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Fears about the polio vaccine have been so prevalent in rural Nigeria that villagers have fled their homes when polio vaccination teams arrive.</p>
<p>The total cost of fighting the polio-vaccine scare in Nigeria and in other countries where the sterility rumours spread has cost $200 million and caused the World Health Organisation and its partners to miss their 2005 polio-eradication deadline by at least two years, said Dr David Heymann, WHO&rsquo;s top official in the fight against the disease.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, experts say, is rooted in health workers&rsquo; own failure to inform people in poor countries about real vaccine-related risks.</p>
<p>In the developed world, it is virtually a legal requirement to inform people of any potential vaccine-associated risks. But in the developing world, standards of informed consent are often abandoned as a logistical stumbling block.</p>
<p>Claire Hajaj, who has worked on polio eradication at UNICEF, said communicating medical risk to illiterate and remote populations was not always possible. &ldquo;Usually, you have to settle for something that&rsquo;s not quite as perfect,&rdquo; Ms Hajaj said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go repeatedly to families who have no electricity or sanitation,&rdquo; said Michael Galway, head of UNICEF&rsquo;s polio communications in India. &ldquo;They see their kids dying from things like malaria and diarrhoea. And then we bring the polio vaccine &mdash; which is not what they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And public-health officials have kept quiet about one obvious adverse effect the polio vaccine can cause: polio itself. For approximately every three million doses of the oral polio vaccine administered, one child is paralysed by the live virus in the vaccine itself.</p>
<p>Some medical ethicists say this failure to educate is wrong &mdash; regardless of the difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failing to divulge adverse effects is non-transparent, and it&rsquo;s essentially a lie,&rdquo; said Dr Ross Upshur, a specialist in medical ethics at the University of Toronto. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point in controlling infectious diseases if you&rsquo;ve violated communities&rsquo; dignities and rights in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the root cause, experts agree on the dangers of rumours in public-health efforts.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, some mothers try to fool health workers into believing their children have been vaccinated by painting their children&rsquo;s fingers with nail polish, an attempt to imitate the ink marks used in vaccine campaigns to record that a child has been immunised.<br>
