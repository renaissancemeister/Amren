<h1>Gov.: New Orleans Crime Calls For Military Presence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, September 16, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Orleans, Louisiana &mdash; National Guard troops and state police will patrol the city through December, Gov. Kathleen Blanco said Saturday at a summit of law enforcement officials and crime experts called to address a spate of killings marring the recovery from Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crime has no role in recovery,&rdquo; Blanco said. &ldquo;It limits our ability to recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police are on pace to recover as many illegal firearms this year as they did in the two previous years &mdash; even though half as many people live in the city now, said Robert Browning, an agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>
<p>But in a positive sign, court and prison repairs should be done next month, an official said, which means the city&rsquo;s crippled criminal justice system will be able to process its influx of suspects more efficiently.</p>
<p>The summit opened hours after an early morning killing brought the city&rsquo;s homicide count for the year to 100.</p>
<p>New Orleans, with a pre-Katrina population of 455,000, had virtually no crime in the months after the storm hit on August 29, 2005, when the city was largely empty.</p>
<p>That changed as the evacuees started returning. In April murders began occurring regularly, sometimes in groups. The current population is uncertain, though various estimates put it at 200,000 to 250,000.</p>
<p>Guard members and state police were sent to New Orleans shortly after what police called one of the city&rsquo;s worst acts of violence in 10 years: the fatal shooting of five teenagers in mid-June.</p>
<p>Over Labor Day weekend, four people died in 13 shootings in the New Orleans area.</p>
<p>The Guard members and state troopers have helped bolster a police department whose membership fell after the storm by more than 200 to about 1,420. Blanco said the cost to the state will be about $14 million.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the governor called the use of troops and state police a stopgap measure to help safeguard the city while other means to deal with crime are developed.</p>
<p>The summit shows the city will no longer tolerate crime, Mayor Ray Nagin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any crime committed with a gun should be charged at the highest possible count, attempted murder at a minimum,&rdquo; Nagin said. &ldquo;And all those crimes must be expedited, put to the front of the line and prosecuted.&rdquo;</p>
