<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Johannesburg &mdash; One million white South Africans &mdash; almost a fifth &mdash; have left the country in the past ten years. </p>
<p>This figure was released last week in a report from the South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR). </p>
<p>Frans Cronjé, who compiled the report, said it was especially crime and affirmative action which had driven a fifth of South Africa&rsquo;s white population out of the country. </p>
<p>He did an analysis of Statistics South Africa&rsquo;s Household Surveys between 1995 and 2005, emigration figures and other reliable estimates on population numbers. </p>
<p>Cronjé said the results left himself and his colleagues dumbfounded. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When we drew the graphs we saw that almost a whole generation of white South Africans are not here anymore.&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>Young people, children leaving </strong></p>
<p>The SAIRR&rsquo;s population pyramid of white South Africans show a definite loss of young people and children under the age of ten. </p>
<p>The figures for 2005 put the number of white South Africans in the country at 4.3 million, 841 000 fewer than the 5.2 million of 1995. </p>
<p>Cronjé predicts that the white population would continue to shrink, and, he said, the situation would have a far-reaching impact on the economy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The white population is getting older, which means the white taxpayers are only going to contribute to the economy for the next twenty years. There would have to be a huge influx of skilled workers to fill this gap. This, unfortunately, is not the case.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Due to the inequalities of the past, the education of most of the black children is still not on par to fill these gaps. </p>
<p>Last year, for example, only 3 000 black learners passed matric with higher grade mathematics, said Cronjé. </p>
<p><strong>Economically productive</strong> </p>
<p>Most of the white emigrants are economically productive people, said Marco Macfarlane, co-author of the report. </p>
<p>However, in the last decade the black economically productive population grew by 81%. Some of these people have slot into the high-income group, where black people make up a third of the top earners. </p>
<p>Whites, however, still account for half of this group, where Indians and coloureds make up 7% and 6% of the high-income group respectively. </p>
<p>The rest of the black entrants to the labour market are busy in the informal sector, which do not necessarily contribute to the tax income. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Black people are entering the economy at a stiff pace, but of the economically active middle class (the country&rsquo;s biggest tax contributors), blacks only account for 1%.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Macfarlane said crime and affirmative action are the top reasons for the exodus of whites. </p>
<p><strong>More whites going to leave</strong> </p>
<p>&ldquo;And because the crime figures are not going to decline rapidly and affirmative action is to continue, more whites are going to leave. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The young people reckon they are being punished for what happened in the previous dispensation. They are furious, because they feel they had no part in it,&rdquo; said Macfarlane. </p>
<p>According to the report the emigrants are between 20 and 40 years old. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the group that have children and help grow the population, but now they&rsquo;re getting their children overseas. And they don&rsquo;t come back. That means the white population is going to continue to shrink.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The decline in the white population in the decade to 2005 is estimated at 16.1%.<br>
