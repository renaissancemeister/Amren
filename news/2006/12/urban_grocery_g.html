<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Leon Davis is out of milk.</p>
<p>The ordeal begins. Grab a coat. Trudge to a bus stop. Catch one bus downtown, then wait for another. Get on, then off at the Aldi store. Carry as much as his bad back will allow &mdash; milk, apple juice, bread. Then take two buses home.</p>
<p>Total time: 21‚ÅÑ2 hours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a hassle for real,&rsquo; said Davis, a beefy 54-year-old student at St. Paul College, where he&rsquo;s learning to be a receptionist. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d call it a real headache.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Much of St. Paul has the same headache. An analysis by the Pioneer Press shows that Davis lives in what health experts have called a &lsquo;food desert&rsquo; &mdash; an urban area with few supermarkets and, therefore, limited access to cheap, healthful food.</p>
<p>It may be common knowledge that urban areas don&rsquo;t have the quality or quantity of food stores enjoyed by suburbs. But the grocery gap has become a chasm that is alarming experts and shoppers alike &mdash; food deserts now engulf one-third of St. Paul and more than half of Minneapolis neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Twin Cities, several suburbs have more than 20 times the food stores per capita as in the food deserts.</p>
<p>And the shortage of food stores is made worse by a shortage of cars &mdash; nearly one out of five households in Minneapolis and St. Paul food deserts don&rsquo;t own vehicles. (One caveat: In Minneapolis and some of the smaller suburbs, neighborhood boundary lines are drawn smaller than those in the capital city. That means some food-desert residents may in fact live close to a grocery sitting just across a boundary.)</p>
<p>In these urban areas, people rely on convenience stores, with higher prices and a limited selection of fruits and vegetables. Some experts say that could be a factor in why inner-city populations have higher rates of food-related illnesses, including heart disease, obesity and diabetes, than do suburbanites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Urban food stores</p>
<p>The Pioneer Press began its analysis with a list of store locations from the Chain Store Guide, which provides data for the retail food industry.</p>
<p>A guide spokesman said the list might miss some stores because of incomplete information from corporations or changes in ownership. So the Pioneer Press cross-checked its list with one from the Minnesota Department of Commerce and added 49 stores &mdash; most too small to make the original list.</p>
<p>The final list has 230 metro-area supermarkets. The food industry defines these as stores with annual sales of more than $2 million for a chain store or $250,000 in sales for an independent store.</p>
<p>It also includes 729 convenience stores, defined as smaller stores with sales below the supermarket benchmarks. These usually also sell gasoline; many urban stores that call themselves groceries or markets fall into the convenience-store category, by industry standards.</p>
<p>The analysis punctured a myth &mdash; that urban convenience stores make up for the lack of supermarkets. There are one-third fewer convenience stores per capita in urban areas than in suburbs, but urban shoppers depend on them because the lack of supermarkets is even more severe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The grocery gap is compounded by a transportation gap. The proportion of households without vehicles in food-desert areas is nearly four times as high as it is in Twin Cities suburbs. People who shop via taxis and buses find it tougher to eat healthfully &mdash; because they have to carry bags of food greater distances.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Measuring food quality</p>
<p>Other studies parallel the findings of the Pioneer Press analysis.</p>
<p>Blaydes&rsquo; 2002 study found that the core region of Hennepin County had one-fifth as many supermarkets or warehouse stores as the county&rsquo;s suburban areas.</p>
<p>She developed a &#8220;marketbasket score&#8221; to measure quality, variety and price of food &mdash; literally comparing apples to apples.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to know: Has that orange been around for five days or five months?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Her conclusion? Bigger is better. And cities are a poor place to be hungry.</p>
<p>On a 40-point scale, convenience stores had an average of 6 points on her marketbasket score; small grocery stores pegged 8; larger grocery stores, 21. Suburban-style supercenter and warehouse stores were given a 29.</p>
<p>Urban food &lsquo;gems&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nick Shuminsky, spokesman for St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman, said industry standards overlook many unique &#8220;gems,&#8221; including farmers&rsquo; markets and small ethnic shops.</p>
<p>One is the Makola African Market on University Avenue. The tiny store stocks foods unknown to most suburbs, such as whole dried catfish displayed in a basket. But missing are apples, broccoli or spinach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several St. Paul shoppers said the &#8220;gems&#8221; aren&rsquo;t suitable for daily needs, from milk to bread to lettuce. Farmers&rsquo; markets, they pointed out, are open only a few days a week in warm weather.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suburban shopping</p>
<p>Compared with urban food deserts, the suburbs are grocery nirvana.</p>
<p>The stores are plentiful. Of the 126 locations of Cub Foods, Rainbow Foods, Wal-Mart, SuperTarget and Costco, nine out of 10 are in the suburbs.</p>
<p>They sell food more cheaply, on average, thanks to membership clubs such as Sam&rsquo;s Club and Costco that offer prices an average of up to 25 percent lower than those in traditional grocery stores &mdash; and all 12 metro locations of the membership clubs are in suburbs.</p>
<p>Suburban stores are often newer, with expanded produce sections. They are bigger &mdash; about 70 percent larger than the average urban store. The quality and especially quantity of food is better.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lushly decorated store, with 65 kinds of vinegar and 250 types of produce, caters to gourmets, manager Steve Zondy said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a whole different level of upscale shopping,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Land, money, convenience</p>
<p>Why are suburbs magnets for supermarkets?</p>
<p>Land &mdash; like food &mdash; is cheaper in the &lsquo;burbs.</p>
<p>The standard suburban supermarket requires seven to 10 acres, according to Mike Sims, vice president for retail for United Properties, which manages retail property. Such a site can cost as much as $150 million, Sims said.</p>
<p>As high as that is, city lots of that size are almost entirely unavailable at any price. That is especially true for the most desirable sites &mdash; on busy streets or freeways with easy access and good visibility.</p>
<p>Retail food stores seek growing neighborhoods with money to spend, according to supermarket-building consultant Olson. Once again, that favors the suburbs. Affluent areas such as Stillwater or Lakeville are the darlings of retail, Olson said.</p>
<p>Add to that the perception of lower crime rates and more business-friendly policies, Sims said, and the suburban advantages are overwhelming.</p>
