<h1><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/12/08/oppenheim.sundown.town/index.html">Texas City Haunted By &lsquo;No Blacks After Dark&rsquo; Past</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keith Oppenheim, CNN, Dec. 12, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As a reporter for CNN, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time travelling around the United States. And along the way, I&rsquo;ve developed some impressions of who we are, and where we are, as a society.</p>
<p>When it comes to relations between blacks and whites, it&rsquo;s no surprise to me that we are, in many places, still separated, despite a desire for better relations. African-Americans often live in one neighborhood, whites in another.</p>
<p>When I was recently assigned to cover a story about the history of racism in Vidor, Texas, for the &#8220;Paula Zahn Now&#8221; show, it turned out that I was surprised by some of the things I found, namely that some whites were openly telling me they still wanted separation from blacks.</p>
<p>Vidor is a small city of about 11,000 people near the Texas Gulf Coast, not too far from the Louisiana border. Despite the fact that Beaumont, a much bigger city just 10 minutes away, is quite integrated, Vidor is not. There are very few blacks there; it&rsquo;s mostly white. That is in large part because of a history of racism in Vidor, a past that continues to haunt the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been trying to live down something for 40 to 50 years,&#8221; said Orange County Commissioner Beamon Minton. &#8220;Once convicted, you&rsquo;re a convicted felon. You can&rsquo;t ever put that aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vidor was one of hundreds of communities in America known as &#8220;sundown towns,&#8221; places where blacks were not welcome after dark. In some of these towns, signs &mdash; handwritten or printed &mdash; were posted, saying things like &#8220;Whites Only After Dark.&#8221; But in general, sundown towns existed by reputation. Blacks knew they were places to avoid after dark.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vidor also had a reputation as a haven for the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, Jones recalls seeing a Klan rally in Vidor when he was a child. Vidor city officials point that that doesn&rsquo;t mean the rally was filled with Vidor residents. They say the Klan brought members from all over and targeted Vidor for rallies.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable instances of that was in 1993, when the federal government tried to change years of racial separation, and brought a handful of black families into Vidor&rsquo;s public housing. In response, the Klan marched in Vidor. Within months, the few black families moved out. And African-Americans were left with a deep impression that still exists today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vidor officials acknowledge racism is still present in Vidor. But they also say it is a very different place from the one it was decades ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the Vidor schools posted a billboard, which included the face of an African-American girl as a way to attract black families. City leaders also point out that Vidor reached out to African-American victims of Hurricane Katrina, and provided temporary shelter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of our citizens are not racist,&#8221; said Vidor Mayor Joe Hopkins. &#8220;We&rsquo;d welcome anybody here who is a good solid citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, I was left with a genuine impression that some Vidor residents wanted the city to welcome other ethnicities. But when I sat down in a caf√©, and talked to residents, I also heard the sound of prejudice.</p>
<p>Peggy Fruge told me she&rsquo;d welcome blacks to her neighborhood. Then she said this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t mind being friends with them, talking and stuff like that, but as far as mingling and eating with them, all that kind of stuff, that&rsquo;s where I draw the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was taken aback, surprised the sound of prejudice could emerge so easily. But, I realized, her comments only reflected part of the story.</p>
