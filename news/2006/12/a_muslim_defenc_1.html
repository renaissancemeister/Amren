			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Breiger and April Lindgren, National Post (Canada), Dec. 15, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ontario&rsquo;s Premier and several religious groups yesterday criticized a provincial judge&rsquo;s decision to banish the Christmas tree standing in a Toronto courthouse lobby because it might offend non-Christians.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s so stupid, I&rsquo;m at a loss for words,&#8221; said Tarek Fatah, founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;The judge should take a trip to the rest of the world. Christmas is celebrated by Muslims in many countries &mdash; they should ban political correctness, not Christmas trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people are offended [by a Christmas tree], I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re offended,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it indicates a serious mental disorder when people want to bring down other people&rsquo;s happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group issued a news release calling on Muslims to &#8220;celebrate Christmas with their Christian cousins and light up Christmas trees to send a message to the Ontario judge that she is wrong on all counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hindus would be highly upset if another group infringed on our right to put up Hindu symbols in public,&#8221; said Ron Banerjee, spokesman for the Hindu Conference of Canada.</p>
<p>TOLERANCE</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s important that political correctness not be taken too far so that we&rsquo;re being crazy about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty called the move a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; of the significance of having such a multicultural province.</p>
<p>&#8220;We enjoy the wonderful privilege of building a pluralistic, multicultural society,&#8221; he told reporters, noting that Queen&rsquo;s Park, where there are Christmas trees aplenty this time of year, also celebrates Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and other traditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not asking any one of the wonderful communities that make up our province to somehow abandon their traditions. What we&rsquo;re saying is let&rsquo;s share in those opportunities, let&rsquo;s better understand those celebrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t offend anyone when we celebrate Diwali at Queen&rsquo;s Park or celebrate Hanukkah at Queen&rsquo;s Park or celebrate Eid at Queen&rsquo;s Park. That&rsquo;s part and parcel of who we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The backlash comes after Justice Marion Cohen ordered a Christmas tree at the Ontario Court of Justice be relocated to a back hallway behind frosted glass doors &mdash; near the family court desk where the door is adorned with a Santa Claus poster.</p>
<p>Judge Cohen defended the relocation at 311 Jarvis St. in a letter to staff this week, which acknowledged people are &#8220;upset&#8221; with the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware the Christmas tree has been placed in the front lobby at Christmas time for many years,&#8221; the letter said. &#8220;I do not think it appropriate that when the clients of our court enter our courthouse, the first thing they see is a Christian symbol.</p>
<p>&#8220;The message to the many non-Christians, who attend our court and are confronted with this symbol, is that they are not part of this institution. It does not belong to them. They are different.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is unclear if the move was sparked by complaints, and Judge Cohen declined to take questions.</p>
