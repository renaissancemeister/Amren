						<p>The bribe has long been a shortcut to wealth and power along the Texas-Mexico border. But these days, it&rsquo;s not just politicians lining their pockets or crooked lawmen taking bags of cash to overlook drug loads.</p>
<p>The culture of bribery is quietly seeping into new realms of government, from school districts to municipal court, experts say.</p>
<p>Proximity to Mexico is at least partly to blame, said Anthony Knopp, a professor who teaches border history at the University of Texas at Brownsville.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&rsquo;re dealing with is a Third World country on the other side of the border where there is a culture of corruption &hellip; corruption will show up here, naturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>And show up, it has.</p>
<p>Since March 2004, 19 public officials including former Cameron County Sheriff Conrado Cantu, a city manager, several county commissioners, a school superintendent and several school trustees have been convicted of taking kickbacks and bribes.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
The way things are done</p>
<p>The bribery culture has existed in Mexico for centuries. There, the bribe is known as la mordida &mdash; &#8221;the bite.&#8221; Paying mordidas is often the most efficient &mdash; or the only &mdash; way of getting things done in Mexico.</p>
<p>Federal officials in the Rio Grande Valley say they began seeing rising numbers of bribery cases several years ago, and formed a task force to target corruption and graft.</p>
<p>Bribery &#8220;undermines public confidence in government,&#8221; said Don DeGabrielle, the U.S. attorney for the federal district that stretches from Houston to Laredo and south to Brownsville.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for some, the temptation is too great.</p>
<p>A Brownsville municipal court clerk was recently sentenced to probation for fixing traffic tickets, undeterred by hundreds of police officers around her at the police station. For a &#8220;fee,&#8221; a city code inspector and a permit clerk allegedly let six used-car lot owners operate in Brownsville without passing building inspections.</p>
<p>The culture of bribery &#8220;has filtered down to where it&rsquo;s not just law enforcement,&#8221; a veteran U.S. agent said on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Bribery of lawmen remains a problem, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing it a lot more &hellip; and it isn&rsquo;t always cash,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could be bottles of liquor, it could be a car. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hunting trips.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alleged entrapment</p>
<p>Some in the Valley blame federal authorities.</p>
<p>The government &#8220;creates crime&#8221; by using &#8220;unsavory&#8221; informants to entrap otherwise honest people, said Al Alvarez, a McAllen lawyer who has defended a number of public officials.</p>
<p>As the Valley grows and receives larger shares of state and federal funding, more and more locals get involved in government and some don&rsquo;t know the law, Alvarez said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fallout from another federal investigation was even more tragic in the case of Ed Aparicio, 46, a popular state judge who killed himself last April on the day he announced his resignation. Although the judge was never charged with a crime, FBI agents had searched his home and courthouse chambers, carting off paintings and other potential evidence in a reported bribery investigation.</p>
<p>TV stations in the Valley routinely feature tales of public officials being caught allegedly pocketing bribes in exchange for a range of illegal favors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In another case, the Cameron County district attorney is investigating how the Brownsville Navigation District spent $21.4 million in taxpayer money during a decade-long, futile effort to build a rail bridge to Mexico.</p>
<p>A private attorney hired by the district concluded $10.5 million was paid to subcontractors in Mexico who did little or no work, including a firm with close ties to Mexican officials.</p>
<p>Elections involved</p>
<p>Bribery has also crept into Valley elections, said Othal Brand Jr., who ran his father&rsquo;s unsuccessful campaign for mayor last year in McAllen.</p>
<p>A political worker offered him &#8220;400 votes for $10 apiece, or $4,000,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}or wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some worry that even more public officials could be compromised as vast amounts of drug money flow across the Texas border.</p>
<p>Laredo police frequently stop cars for speeding as they head through town on their way to Mexico, finding &#8220;massive amounts of cash,&#8221; said Jerry Thompson, a history professor at Texas A&M; International University. &#8220;One had $400,000 in a bag in the back seat. He didn&rsquo;t even have it in the trunk.</p>
