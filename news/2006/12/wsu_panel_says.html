<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A Washington State University assistant professor who used a vulgar racial term during a heated political dispute with Republican students was &#8220;immature&#8221; and &#8220;thoughtless,&#8221; but his actions did not constitute discrimination, a new report concludes.</p>
<p>John Streamas has also called WSU a &#8220;racist university&#8221; and contended that some say WSU should stand for &#8220;White Supremacist University,&#8221; said the report from the university&rsquo;s Center for Human Rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report was given to the parties involved in the dispute, and a copy was released Tuesday by Dan Ryder, the student who complained to campus officials, saying he had been insulted.</p>
<p>The report directed some blame for the incident toward WSU&rsquo;s College Republicans, who on Nov. 2 erected a 24-foot-long stretch of chain-link fence on campus as a show of support for the Bush administration&rsquo;s plan to build a fence on the border with Mexico.</p>
<p>The fence drew a crowd of protesters who engaged in heated arguments with College Republicans, and the videotaped showdown garnered national attention, especially on conservative radio and television broadcasts.</p>
<p>During the dispute, Ryder said Streamas, an assistant professor of comparative ethnic studies, called him a &#8220;white (solid waste)-bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>College Republicans demanded that Streamas be fired for saying that, and have said the incident was an example of bias against conservative views on campus.</p>
<p>University President V. Lane Rawlins said last week that Streamas would be reprimanded, but not fired.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier, Streamas has acknowledged using the term, but said it wasn&rsquo;t directed at any individual. Last month he called the fence a provocative and racist symbol, and compared it to Nazis carrying a swastika through a Jewish neighborhood.</p>
<p>The report said it was unwise for Streamas to have made the comment, which it called &#8220;immature, intellectually unsophisticated and thoughtless.&#8221; But a single such utterance during a robust debate did not, by itself, constitute harassment, discrimination or intimidation, the report said.</p>
<p>Streamas, who was born in Tokyo, did not immediately return Associated Press telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t care about the hurt feelings of one white person. The feelings of one little hurt white boy who&rsquo;s got all his white-skinned privilege are nothing compared to the hundreds of people he offended with his racist fence,&#8221; the voice mail said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ryder disagreed with the center&rsquo;s finding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that a person who instructs in a department that preaches equality and diversity and accepting all ideas is not fit to instruct in that department if he can&rsquo;t even have that tolerance for other people&rsquo;s views,&#8221; said Ryder, who is from Olympia.</p>
<p>Ryder said Tuesday he is considering pursuing legal action.</p>
