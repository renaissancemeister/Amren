<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been introduced yet, but a proposed town ordinance targeting illegal immigrants in Pahrump [Nevada] already is drawing comparisons to one of the darkest chapters in U.S. history.</p>
<p>If approved sometime next year, the measure would require &#8220;undocumented foreign nationals&#8221; to register themselves at the Pahrump Town Office within 24 hours of arriving in the community 60 miles west of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants would each have to pay a $200 fee and fill out a form with such information as the names of all their relatives in Nevada and a list of &#8220;all forged or counterfeited documents&#8221; they might have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Registering people? Why don&rsquo;t we just bring back the internment camps?&#8221; Nye County Sheriff Tony DeMeo asked. &#8220;From the standpoint of law enforcement and human decency, I think it&rsquo;s a very ugly piece of trash.&#8221;</p>
<p>The measure will be introduced at tonight&rsquo;s meeting by Pahrump Town Board member Michael Miraglia, author of the controversial &#8220;English-only&#8221; ordinance approved by the board in November.</p>
<p>Miraglia said he played no part in writing the new &#8220;Undocumented Foreign National Registration Ordinance.&#8221; He simply introduced it on behalf of Scott Metro, who used to host a talk show on one of Pahrump&rsquo;s two local television stations.</p>
<p>In a written statement Monday, Metro said the ordinance is meant to address the &#8220;ever increasing threat to our security, economy and well being&#8221; posed by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The measure &#8220;deals only with those that choose to ignore our laws&#8221; and &#8220;knows no race or color,&#8221; he said in the statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fernando Romero, president of Hispanics In Politics, called the ordinance &#8220;mean-spirited, unfair, unjust and unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The purpose is to create and incite racial tension,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The perception is they hate us. It&rsquo;s a racial thing. And the perception in this case is almost 100 percent real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the version of the measure set to be introduced tonight, illegal immigrants who fail to register face a $500 fine and 10 days in jail for the first offense and a $5,000 fine and 100 days in jail for the second offense. The penalty for a third offense is deportation, which would be arranged and paid for by the town using the money it collects in fines and registration fees.</p>
<p>The proposal even comes with its own defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Under Article 4, any &#8220;non-government agency&#8221; that challenges the ordinance in court must first shell out $20,000 to &#8220;cover any costs which may be incurred by the Town of Pahrump.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a &#8220;challenge fee,&#8221; but Lee Rowland, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada, jokingly referred to it as &#8220;the ACLU tax.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This will be Miraglia&rsquo;s final meeting as a member of the board.</p>
<p>When Gov. Kenny Guinn appointed him in July to fill out the term of another member, it was too late to file as a candidate for a full term on the board.</p>
<p>The two-year resident of Pahrump now has his sights set on bigger things. &#8220;I&rsquo;d like to run for a higher office, because I think there is a lot of work to be done in this country and this city and this state,&#8221; Miraglia said. &#8220;We need people with backbone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miraglia&rsquo;s &#8220;English Language and Patriot Reaffirmation Ordinance&#8221; declares English the town&rsquo;s official language, denies town benefits to undocumented immigrants, and bans the flying of foreign flags by themselves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also during tonight&rsquo;s meeting, Miraglia will urge his fellow board members to approve a resolution that calls on state and federal lawmakers to adopt English as the official language and step up enforcement of immigration laws.</p>
<p>Romero plans to be at tonight&rsquo;s meeting to speak out against the idea, even though several people have told him that it has very little chance of passing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Romero acknowledged that the ordinance could frighten off some illegal immigrants, but he said, &#8220;The people it should really scare are the people of Pahrump.&#8221;</p>
<p>He predicted that if the community becomes known as a hotbed for bigots, residents will move away and business owners will rethink their plans to open shop there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DeMeo said Pahrump got &#8220;a bad rap&#8221; as a result of Miraglia&rsquo;s measure and compared to that, this new measure is like &#8220;the difference between the Girl Scouts and a SWAT team.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff has announced publicly that his office would not enforce any provision of the &#8220;English-only&#8221; ordinance. On Monday, he said he has no plans to enforce this new ordinance either, assuming the town board even approves it.</p>
