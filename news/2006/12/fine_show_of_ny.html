<h1><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/story/483452p-406942c.html">Fine Show Of N.Y.C.&rsquo;s Diversity</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayor Bloomberg welcomed the most racially and ethnically diverse Police Academy class in the history of the city to the NYPD yesterday &mdash; calling the recruits a &#8220;gift to the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s &#8220;New York, New York&#8221; played inside Madison Square Garden, the 1,359 rookie cops marched past adoring loved ones before assembling on the floor of the famed arena.</p>
<p>About 300 of the class&rsquo; recruits &mdash; more than one in five &mdash; are foreign-born and come from 65 different countries, police officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the rookies, about 46% are white, 28% Hispanic, 17% black and 8% Asian. About 18% are women and 17% have military backgrounds, police officials said.</p>
<p>NYPD brass said the historic diversity of the class was a direct result of the department&rsquo;s push to hire more minorities and women and find recruits who speak foreign languages.</p>
<p>The number of cadets born abroad is also likely the highest ever, but formalized tracking did not start until this year, officials said.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at a few of the city&rsquo;s newest cops:</p>
<p>James Grover Wilson</p>
<p>Wilson immigrated to Brooklyn from Ukraine about eight years ago when he was 24. And one of the first things he did was legally change his name from Yevgeniy Nazaochuk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I changed my name to be more American,&#8221; said the 6-foot-tall recruit.</p>
<p>Wilson, who speaks Ukrainian, Russian and English, said he chose &#8220;Grover&#8221; as his middle name after reading about President Grover Cleveland, who as the 22nd and 24th commander in chief was the only President to leave the White House and return for a second term four years later.</p>
<p>The NYPD&rsquo;s roughly $25,000 starting salary didn&rsquo;t deter Wilson, who had been earning a higher wage as a plumber.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ibrar Fazal</p>
<p>Fazal followed his three older brothers into the ranks of the NYPD.</p>
<p>While the 24-year-old father was born in Brooklyn, two of his older brothers, Aftaz, 42, and Afzal, 38, who both work out of commands in southern Brooklyn, were born in Pakistan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the brothers speak Pakistani and English.</p>
<p>Wilson Lema</p>
<p>The 29-year-old father signed up for the NYPD after completing a five-year stint in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>Lema, who emigrated from Ecuador when he was 15, served in Germany and Iraq before returning to his home in Brooklyn.</p>
