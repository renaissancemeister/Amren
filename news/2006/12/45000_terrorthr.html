<h1><a href="https://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53151">45,000 Terror-Threat Illegals Released Into U.S. Population</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily.com, Nov. 29, 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Half of the 91,516 illegal aliens from terror-sponsoring countries and those of &#8220;special interest&#8221; apprehended at the border between 2001 and 2005 were released into the U.S. population, according to a report by the inspector general&rsquo;s office of the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;Detention and Removal of Illegal Aliens,&#8221; released earlier this year with little fanfare or attention, suggests about 85 percent of those aliens &mdash; potentially the most dangerous &mdash; would abscond and likely never be seen by authorities again.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the danger such aliens pose to the national security, the report cites a DHS official testifying that terrorist organizations &#8220;believe illegal entry into the U.S. is more advantageous than legal entry for operations reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Budget shortfalls were the explanations for why some 45,008 potential terrorists were released by authorities over a period of nearly five years after Sept. 11, 2001. The budget crunches prompted immigration officials to place strict limits on detention bed space, recruitment, training, travel and expansion of enforcement programs, the report explained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given that only one in four aliens attempting to enter the U.S. during this period was caught, that would suggest some 350,000 from high-risk nations entered the country through this five-year period. An additional 400,000 criminal aliens would also have made it into the country between 2001 and 2004, according to the report.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a total of 750,000 aliens who would be either known criminals before entering the country illegally or who originated from a terror-sponsoring nation or one in which terrorists are known to operate.</p>
<p>This news hits following WND&rsquo;s report yesterday that 12 Americans are murdered every day by illegal aliens, according to statistics released by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. If those numbers are correct, it translates to 4,380 Americans murdered annually by illegal aliens. That&rsquo;s 21,900 since Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>But the carnage wrought by illegal alien murderers represents only a fraction of the pool of blood spilled by American citizens as a result of an open border and un-enforced immigration laws.</p>
<p>While King reports 12 Americans are murdered daily by illegal aliens, he says 13 are killed by drunk illegal alien drivers &mdash; for another annual death toll of 4,745. That&rsquo;s 23,725 since Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>While no one &mdash; in or out of government &mdash; tracks all U.S. accidents caused by illegal aliens, the statistical and anecdotal evidence suggests many of last year&rsquo;s 42,636 road deaths involved illegal aliens.</p>
<p>A report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Study found 20 percent of fatal accidents involve at least one driver who lacks a valid license. In California, another study showed that those who have never held a valid license are about five times more likely to be involved in a fatal road accident than licensed drivers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King also reports eight American children are victims of sexual abuse by illegal aliens every day &mdash; a total of 2,920 annually.</p>
<p>Based on a one-year in-depth study, Deborah Schurman-Kauflin of the Violent Crimes Institute of Atlanta estimates there are about 240,000 illegal immigrant sex offenders in the United States who have had an average of four victims each. She analyzed 1,500 cases from January 1999 through April 2006 that included serial rapes, serial murders, sexual homicides and child molestation committed by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Edwin Rubenstien, president of ESR Research Economic Consultants, in Indianapolis in 1980, federal and state correctional facilities held fewer than 9,000 criminal aliens. But at the end of 2003, approximately 267,000 illegal aliens were incarcerated in all U.S. jails and prisons.</p>
<p>While the federal government doesn&rsquo;t track illegal alien murders, illegal alien rapes or illegal alien drunk driving deaths, it has studied illegal aliens incarcerated in U.S. prisons.</p>
<p>In April 2005, the Government Accountability Office released a report on a study of 55,322 illegal aliens incarcerated in federal, state, and local facilities during 2003. It found the following:</p>
<p>*	The 55,322 illegal aliens studied represented a total of 459,614 arrests &mdash; some eight arrests per illegal alien;</p>
<p>*	Their arrests represented a total of about 700,000 criminal offenses &mdash; some 13 offenses per illegal alien;</p>
<p>*	36 percent had been arrested at least five times before.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the vast majority of illegal aliens are decent people who work hard and are only trying to make a better life for themselves and their families, (something you or I would probably do if we were in their place), it is also a fact that a disproportionately high percentage of illegal aliens are criminals and sexual predators,&#8221; states Peter Wagner, author of a new report called &#8220;The Dark Side of Illegal Immigration.&#8221; &#8220;That is part of the dark side of illegal immigration and when we allow the &lsquo;good&rsquo; in we get the &lsquo;bad&rsquo; along with them. The question is, how much &lsquo;bad&rsquo; is acceptable and at what price?&#8221;</p>
