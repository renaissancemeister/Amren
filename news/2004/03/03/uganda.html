				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/africa/3525869.stm">Ugandans to Sue Over Colonialism</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				The Bunyoro-Kitara kingdom in Uganda, says it is suing the UK for alleged atrocities committed by its soldiers during the colonial period. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Mar. 2</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokesman for the Kingdom Ernest Kizza told the BBC they are seeking &pound;3trillion ($5,500bn). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Kizza said they will present written evidence at the International Court in the Hague to prove their case. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also said that the UK colonial authorities took their land and gave it to a rival kingdom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kingdoms in Uganda were banned in 1966 but 10, including Bunyoro-Kitara, were restored when President Yoweri Museveni came to power in 1987. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Conquered </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Bunyoro was one of the richest kingdom&rsquo;s in Africa that was plundered and destroyed. Until now the population is in poverty,&rdquo; Mr Kizza told the BBC&rsquo;s Network Africa programme. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said they have letters written to the Queen of England by military officers informing her of the number of families and animals destroyed in the invasions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The western Ugandan Bunyoro-Kitara kingdom resisted the British but was conquered after the rival Buganda kingdom joined hands with the British. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Kizza said they also intend to sue the Buganda kingdom and the Uganda government to recover their land lost following the invasion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the British government signed an agreement with the Buganda kingdom in 1900 allowing them to take over land belonging to the Bunyoro-Kitara kingdom.
