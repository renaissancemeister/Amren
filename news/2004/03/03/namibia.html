				<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/africa/3489578.stm">Namibia Plans White Land Seizures</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Namibia will start to forcibly take land from white farmers to give to landless blacks, the government says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Feb. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prime minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said in a national address that land reform had to be speeded up but it would remain orderly and peaceful. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government has so far only purchased land from farmers who wish to sell for redistribution to some 240,000 people waiting to be settled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 4,000, mostly white, farmers own almost half of Namibia&rsquo;s arable land. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Gurirab did not give details of how many farms would be seized or when the programme would start. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, he said the farmers would be fairly compensated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>High prices blamed </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, some Namibian farm workers threatened to invade white-owned farms and the BBC&rsquo;s Frauke Jensen in Windhoek says political pressure ahead of this year&rsquo;s elections may have influenced the government announcement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				NAMIBIAN LAND REFORM 
			</p>
			<p>
				118 farms bought since 1990 
			</p>
			<p>
				$105m spent 
			</p>
			<p>
				37,100 people resettled 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Gurirab urged those waiting to be resettled to remain patient. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The expropriation of land is being introduced to accelerate the land reform process in the country. However, the introduction does not signal the doing away with the principle of willing-buyer-willing-seller; the two interventions will actually run concurrently,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He blamed the delay on arbitrary inflation of land prices and unavailability of productive land. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since independence in 1990, the government has purchased 118 farms for $105m, resettling 37,100 individuals, according to official figures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Namibia&rsquo;s President Sam Nujoma, who is a close ally of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Robert Mugabe, is due to step down from power later this year.
