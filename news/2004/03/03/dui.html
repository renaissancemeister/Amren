			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				&rsquo;He&rsquo;s going to come back and do it again and kill somebody&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>WorldNetDaily.com, Mar. 3 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				An illegal immigrant pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicants for the fourth time in four years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Andres Lopez-Cortes, 31, has been deported at least once to Mexico, but returned to the Seattle area where he slammed into a car driven by a 17-year-old who was stopped at a traffic light Dec. 31, the local King County Journal reported. The teenager, Paul Conley, suffered whiplash. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lopez-Cortes also pleaded guilty Monday to a charge of hit-and-run driving. A judge in Auburn, Wash., fined him $5,000, but suspended $3,500, and ordered him to pay court costs and restitution for damages to the car and medical bills, the Journal said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal immigration officials have been notified about the case, but Auburn officials said they didn&rsquo;t know what immigration action might be taken. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Illegal immigrants convicted in a U.S. court generally serve their sentences before any deportation action is considered, according to immigration officials. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marie Sebrechts, a spokeswoman for the new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, said she couldn&rsquo;t speculate on whether Lopez-Cortes might be deported again, the Seattle-area paper reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When considering deportation, illegal immigrants with multiple illegal entries generally are given highest priority, immigration officials said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lopez-Cortes was arrested for driving under the influence in July 1998, April 1999, July 2000 and May 2002, court records show. He received a one-year jail sentence after his May 2002 arrest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite being an illegal immigrant, Lopez-Cortes apparently had a driver&rsquo;s license. In addition to his four arrests, he had been cited four times for driving with a suspended license. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He had no insurance, however, and Conley had no coverage for uninsured drivers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Conley told the Journal he doubts he will be reimbursed for the more than $2,000 it will cost to repair his customized car. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Besides the loss of my car, I have back pain now, and I have no idea how long I&rsquo;ll be having back pain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really fair at all.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Conley&rsquo;s mother, Patricia Matthews, said she&rsquo;s mad &ldquo;the system&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t handle Lopez-Cortes properly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is going to be the kind of situation that&rsquo;s going to continue,&rdquo; she told the paper. &ldquo;My concern is that he&rsquo;s going to come back and do it again and kill somebody.&rdquo;
