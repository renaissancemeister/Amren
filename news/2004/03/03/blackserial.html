				Expert: Black Serial Killers Not So Uncommon
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Beverly Corbell, The Advertiser (LA), Jun. 22, 2003</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LAFAYETTE &mdash; While the Multi-Agency Homicide Task Force that investigated the south Louisiana serial killings focused much of its 10-month search on finding a white man, the suspect who now sits in an East Baton Parish jail is black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One professor who has consulted with police departments nationwide on serial crimes said black serial killers are more common than many think. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Derrick Todd Lee was arrested in late May in connection with the deaths of four women from Baton Rouge and one from Lafayette. DNA evidence pointed to a sixth victim from Addis on Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				National expert Eric W. Hickey, speaking with The Daily Advertiser from his Fresno, Calif., home, said that police sometimes make assumptions based on race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a myth that serial killers are all white. There are actually several black serial killers, but historically, we have not paid much attention,&rdquo; Hickey said. &ldquo;If a poor, black male was preying on black prostitutes, it wouldn&rsquo;t make the news.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hickey said roughly 
			</p>
			<p>
				80 percent of serial killers are white, but a recent study he conducted of 400 serial killers showed 
			</p>
			<p>
				22 percent to be of African-American descent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At any given time, Hickey said, there are 30 to 40 active serial killers on the loose in the United States. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most serial killings tend to be within race lines, white-on-white or black-on-black, Hickey said. That should have tipped off police in Atlanta when they were investigating the slayings of more than 20 black children, for which Wayne Williams, a black man, was arrested in June 1981. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They should have known no white man was going to walk into a ghetto,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the same kind of assumption might have led Louisiana authorities to believe the serial killer was white. Four of the five victims of the serial killer were white: Baton Rouge residents Gina Wilson Green, Charlotte Murray Pace, Pam Kinamore and Carrie Lynn Yoder. Victim Trineisha Den&eacute; Colomb of Lafayette was a light-skinned black woman. On Wednesday, the death of a sixth victim, Geralyn DeSoto, was linked to Lee by DNA evidence. DeSoto was also white.For months, the public suspected a white man had committed the killings. It wasn&rsquo;t until after the sketch of a black man wanted in attacks against women in Breaux Bridge was released on May 23 that Lee was apprehended. The task force received more than 600 calls in the next few days and Lee was arrested in Atlanta four days later. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think of black males as being psychopathic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in denial because we get so caught up in profiles we develop, we don&rsquo;t think outside the box.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				White or black, most serial killers are psychopaths and feel no sense of remorse, Hickey said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Ninety percent of all psychopaths in serial murder are men, and it&rsquo;s always about control and power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sense of control with no conscience.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Half of all slayings in the United States are never prosecuted, Hickey said, and most serial killing cases don&rsquo;t get national media attention. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is possible to get away with murder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a myth that they (serial killers) are all Hannibal Lector types. A lot are just average. The ones who make the news are more the anomalies.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hickey has been following news accounts of Lee&rsquo;s arrest in which those who knew Lee say he apparently came from a good family and was known as a friendly guy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most serial killers have deep-seated psychological problems, Hickey said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Something always happens in that person&rsquo;s life when he was young that influenced him as an adult. There is always a problem,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; becomes manifested, the serial killer acts on others, not the on original source, Hickey said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called proxy murders,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when they can&rsquo;t kill the person they really hate.&rdquo; 
			</p>

				Serial Killing Is No Longer A White Folks Thing
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Earl Ofari Hutchinson, <a href="https://www.alternet.org/">AlterNet</a>, Oct. 31, 2002 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many a black comedian has perversely cracked that blacks may kill each other, but they don&rsquo;t shoot-up, blow-up, or hack-up crowds of people. This bit of gallows humor always gets an uproarious laugh from black audiences. For decades blacks took morbid pride and comfort in the notion that despite the long, tortured experience of slavery, segregation, racially motivated violence and poverty, mass killing supposedly was a white folks thing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The assumption was that all serial killers were young, whacked out white males. It is easy to believe that. In the rash of Hollywood slasher, horror, and maniacal thrill kill films, serial killers are routinely depicted as deranged white males. The obsessive media attention on serial killers such as Son of Sam, David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and the Unabomber, also reinforce the notion that serial killers are loopy white males. The horde of police, profiling experts, and psychologists that paraded endlessly across the TV screen during the serial sniper ordeal speculating about who the killer was and why he killed bought into this stereotype. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If, as it appears, John Allen Muhammad, cold-bloodedly gunned down a dozen persons, and terrorized the Washington D.C. area, they were all embarrassingly, and wildly wrong in their assumptions. And all the old profiles and theories about who mass killers are must be scrapped. But then again those profiles should be scrapped. Muhammad is not a total aberration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two studies on serial killers that specifically looked at the race of the killers found that blacks make up about 15 percent of America&rsquo;s rogue&rsquo;s gallery of mass murderers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their ghastly killings still strike fear, dread and disgust in the communities they pillaged. During the 1980s, Wayne Williams was convicted of multiple murders in Atlanta and authorities think he may have killed even more. Coral Watts claimed that he killed 13 women in several states. In the early 1990s, Cleophus Prince Jr. stabbed six women in San Diego, and authorities in East St. Louis strongly suspect a black man is responsible for a string of still unsolved killings of prostitutes in the area. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The victims of black serial murderers almost always are other blacks, who most often live in the poorest inner city neighborhoods where the murder rates are far higher than in middle-class suburbs. Because black on black violence is so entrenched and pervasive, it is far too often considered routine, and police are often more lax in their attitudes toward the violence than if the victims were white. This makes it much easier for black serial murders to go undetected for far longer times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The implicit message is that black lives are expendable. This perceived devaluation of black lives through the horrid mix of racism, ignorance, and indifference has encouraged disrespect for the law and has forced many blacks to internalize anger and displace aggression onto other blacks. And that&rsquo;s important to understand, because those young blacks that commit random self-destructive acts, no matter how far beyond the pale of society&rsquo;s accepted code of behavior, still are savvy enough to target victims who pose no real physical or personal threat to them. The serial sniper&rsquo;s victims fit that profile. They were racially diverse, posed no danger to the sniper, and were apparently chosen at random. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the immediate weeks before Muhammad&rsquo;s alleged terror spree there are disturbing signs that more blacks driven by rage, bitterness, and frustration, are more willing than ever to wreak random and grotesque violence on themselves and others. In September, a pack of young, one as young as 10 years old, and not so young black males, mauled a hapless man in Milwaukee. In June, another mob of young blacks grabbed national headlines when they stomped to death two men in Chicago. The mob&rsquo;s victims in Milwaukee and Chicago were low-income, middle-aged men, or had alcohol and drug problems. They were easy pickings, just as the serial sniper&rsquo;s victims were. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though it&rsquo;s not yet known exactly what drove Muhammad to his alleged killing binge, it is known that he was a man consumed by personal rage and frustration over failed marriages, tangled personal relationships, sour business dealings, and a rocky military career. These personal demons, not terrorist ties of which authorities have yet to find evidence, may well have been enough to push him to commit his monstrous destructive acts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But equally ominous, his killing rampage showed that it is a perilously short step from the random violence that claims innocent lives, causes monumental personal suffering, and paralyzes many poor, inner city black neighborhoods, to random violence that causes personal suffering, and paralyzes whole cities, even a nation. That&rsquo;s a terrible price to pay for ignoring walking time bombs such as Muhammad. And as we discovered with him, they can come in all colors.
