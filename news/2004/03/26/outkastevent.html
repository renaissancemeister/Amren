				Member of soul duo pictured brandishing firearm part of fund-raiser with ex-presidents, candidates 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>WorldNetDaily.com, Mar. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the Democratic Party is known for its aversion to weapons and has pushed legislation limiting firearm rights, ex-Presidents Carter and Clinton joined a star-studded fund-raiser last night featuring the rap duo Outkast, which promotes itself with an image of one member of the group brandishing a handgun. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The event at the Washington, D.C., nightclub Dream was to feature Ginuwine, Kenneth &ldquo;Babyface&rdquo; Edmonds and Q-Tip, along with Outkast, the New York Times reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the club event, Democrats were to gather at what was billed as one of the largest party fund-raisers of all time, with an anticipated net of $11 million. Besides Carter and Clinton, luminaries planning to attend were former Vice President Al Gore, presidential candidate John Kerry, most of the other Democratic presidential candidates and former candidates Eugene J. McCarthy and George McGovern. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The all-you-can-eat barbeque event was scheduled for the National Building Museum in the nation&rsquo;s capital, where 2,000 patrons were expected to pay $1,000 minimum to attend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Outkast&rsquo;s website, <a href="https://outkast.com/">outkast.com,</a> one member of the group, Dre (aka Andre Benjamin), is seen prominently brandishing a smoking gun in his right hand. (After going to site, click on the right-hand image labeled &ldquo;The Love Below.&rdquo;) 
			</p>
			<p>
				The second event, featuring Outkast, appeared to be targeted at a different economic class, with 5,000 people expecting to pay just $50 each. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outkast won the Album of the Year Grammy last month for their latest project, &ldquo;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,&rdquo; which has sold over 3.5 million copies. CBS apologized to the Native-American community after the group appeared on the broadcast in feathers and war paint dancing around a teepee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The award-winning album contains profanity-laced songs with titles such as &ldquo;Where are My Panties?&rdquo; &ldquo;She Lives in My Lap&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vibrate.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				As WorldNetDaily reported, in 2002 Outkast was the featured act in an annual music festival held in Columbia, S.C., that organizers called a &ldquo;signature family event.&rdquo; Those in charge of the event believed the duo would help save the financially troubled festival.
