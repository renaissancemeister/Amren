				Mexican Officials Accused of Trafficking Immigrants
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Louie Gilot, El Paso Times, Mar. 25 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				JUAREZ &mdash; The Mexican government dealt a blow to a large criminal organization staffed by Mexican public servants who helped smuggle immigrants into the United States from Ju&aacute;rez, officials with Mexico&rsquo;s attorney general&rsquo;s office said Tuesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Agents from the Agencia Federal de Investigation, the Mexican FBI, arrested 42 people Friday in all levels of government in 12 Mexican states. Among them were seven federal immigration officers working in Ju&aacute;rez, including three assigned to Grupo Beta, a task force dedicated to rescuing immigrants from the desert, the river and other dangers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mexico Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha said the officials &ldquo;offered information about police raids, illegally freed captured migrants, and allowed them to pass with falsified documents.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s position is clear: The traffic of human beings is shameful and intolerable. It means trafficking in human necessity, in the dreams of a good life for many men, women and families. When public servants are involved, it hurts our institutions as well, and our ideals of liberty, justice and social well-being,&rdquo; Macedo de la Concha said in a news conference Tuesday in Mexico City. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ring might have operated on the American side of the border, Mexican officials said, but it wasn&rsquo;t clear Tuesday whether officials had contacted their U.S. counterparts. The 2-year-old investigation continues. Warrants were issued for 15 more people, including two in Ju&aacute;rez, who are now wanted. Officials did not release their identities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Officials said the smuggling ring brought Brazilians, Cubans, Uruguayans, Asians and Central Americans to Mexico from its southern states of Quintana Roo and Chiapas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The migrants traveled by bus or flew to the Ju&aacute;rez airport. There, civil servants would drive them to hotels and collect money from them, attorney general spokesman Socrates Campos said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Ju&aacute;rez, the men arrested were Juan Rodriguez Perez, 52; Jose Francisco Delgado Rojas, 47; Jose Javier Garma Aldana, 32; Ruben Madrigal Hernandez, age unavailable; Jose Javier Garma Aldana, 32; Ignacio Hernandez Vasquez, 52; Francisco Javier Dias Romero, 27; and Edgar Rios Lopez, age unavailable.

				42 current, former officials become latest catches in 18-month inquiry 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i> Ignacio Ibarra, Arizona Daily Star, Mar. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Leads developed during the investigation into the deaths of 14 illegal border crossers near Yuma nearly three years ago helped lead to the arrests this week of 42 current and former Mexican officials on charges of corruption and complicity in people smuggling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The suspects are accused of forming a network that operated in 12 Mexican states that provided official cover for the smuggling of migrants &mdash; mostly from Brazil, Central America and Asia &mdash; through Mexico. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ring also helped facilitate the crossing of migrants into the United States at various locations along the border, including Agua Prieta. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The accused Mexican officials worked with various smuggling organizations, including the one headed by Ebodio Manilla Cabrera, who is charged in the May 2001 Yuma case, said Mexican Interior Minister Santiago Creel Miranda at a news conference Tuesday in Mexico City. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ring operated in the northern border states of Baja California Norte, Sonora, Chihuahua and Nuevo Leon; the southern border states of Chiapas and Quintana Roo; and the central Mexico states of Jalisco, Tabasco, Veracruz, San Luis Potosi and Mexico; and Mexico City. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The arrests capped an 18-month investigation and marked the largest investigation to date of official complicity in people trafficking, said Rafael Macedo de La Concha, Mexico&rsquo;s attorney general. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigrant trafficking is a shameful, intolerable crime made more serious by the participation of public servants, Macedo said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In recent years, people trafficking has grown into the second-most-lucrative criminal enterprise in Mexico behind drug trafficking, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said Mexican courts issued 226 arrest warrants during the course of the investigation. More than half of them have already been served. The arrests this week were part of the latest phase of the investigation and more arrests are anticipated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Macedo said the investigation was handled exclusively by Mexico, but information was shared with other Mexican and international police agencies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mexican officials contacted Wednesday declined to elaborate on the link the arrests have to the 2001 Arizona case, which involved the smuggling of Mexican nationals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos said the traffickers charged between $2,000 and $6,000 to get illegal entrants into the United States, with the most being paid by Asians.
