			<h1>
				Blacks to Get 49% of Foreign-Owned Mines
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Reuters, Zimbabwe Independent, Mar. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbabwe has proposed a law requiring foreign mining companies to sell up to 49% of operations to local blacks, South Africa&rsquo;s Implats said yesterday, but most of its mines would probably be exempt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Government officials in Harare were not immediately available to comment, but Reuter was given a copy of a document entitled &ldquo;Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill, 2004&rdquo; in which the proposals are laid out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This draft was an internal paper prepared as a basis for discussion with the mining industry,&rdquo; said Les Paton, executive director at Implats. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd (Implats), the world&rsquo;s second biggest platinum producer, has an 82% stake in Zimbabwe Platinum Mines Ltd (Zimplats). 
			</p>
			<p>
				The draft says in order for private companies to hold a mining title, 49% of total shares must be held by &ldquo;historically disadvantaged persons&rdquo; within three years. The requirement is 25% for public firms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We agree with the principle of indigenisation &hellip; however what is of concern to us is the quantum, the 49%, and the timing,&rdquo; Paton told Reuter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimplats however holds a special mining lease which appears to exempt the company&rsquo;s current operations and first phases of expansion from the requirements in the draft legislation, he added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Implats has big plans to expand production in Zimbabwe but it was unclear whether future expansion might be exempt also. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Implats&rsquo; platinum output from Zimbabwe is due to total around 80 000 ounces this year, rising to 140 000 by 2006. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mimosa joint venture in which Implats and Australia&rsquo;s Aquarius Platinum each own half would probably require 25% black ownership, Paton said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A plan is underway to sell a 15% stake in Mimosa to a local black group. The mine is producing 65 000 ounces per year and an expansion could double the figure by 2007. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Paton said Implats had requested a meeting with the Mining minister but no date had been set. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Other mining firms that have operations in Zimbabwe include the world&rsquo;s biggest platinum company, Anglo American Platinum, which is planning to develop the Unki project with production of 58 000 ounces of platinum per year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ghana&rsquo;s Ashanti Goldfields, due to be acquired by AngloGold, owns the Freda-Rebecca gold mine in Zimbabwe which produced 98 255 ounces in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In South Africa, the government&rsquo;s empowerment programme is pressuring firms to increase black participation in the mainstream economy that is still largely controlled by minority whites a decade after the fall of apartheid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A leaked draft of a South African mining bill in 2002 that proposed firms sell half of local mines to blacks spurred a sell-off of South African mining shares. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The final mining legislation due to be passed in May demands that 15% of local mining operations be held by blacks within five years and 26% after 10 years.
