				<a href="https://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/8156347.htm">Immigration Chief Uttered Epithet Against Migrants</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Alfonso Chardy, herald.com (Miami), Mar. 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A federal immigration official who once referred to detained immigrants as &rdquo;scumbuckets&rdquo; has been appointed to oversee the Miami office charged with detaining and deporting foreign nationals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike Rozos&rsquo; selection to the high-ranking post was announced in an electronic message sent March 1 to employees of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the agency&rsquo;s headquarters in Washington. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The text of the e-mail was provided to The Herald by someone with access to the message. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rozos&rsquo; appointment will probably generate controversy because he returns after 14 years to a region where he was branded as anti-immigrant because of remarks he made as deputy administrator at the Krome detention center in West Miami-Dade County. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alluding to allegations of mistreatment of detainees at Krome, Rozos was quoted in USA Today on June 14, 1991, as saying: &ldquo;This is not the creme de la creme. You have got scumbuckets here.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was verbally reprimanded by the then-district director. No other disciplinary action was taken, and he continued his career in the federal immigration bureaucracy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rozos, in a telephone interview Wednesday, said he regretted the remark but noted that it was not properly framed in the USA Today article. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;To the best of my recollection, the discussion was primarily focused toward criminal aliens in Florida,&rdquo; said Rozos, currently a high-ranking administrator at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. &ldquo;Unfortunately, I used the wrong word . . . I erred in my judgment.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cheryl Little, executive director of the Miami-based Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, which has monitored Krome for years, said she hoped Rozos has changed his attitude. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the past, he made some very derogatory remarks about detainees at Krome,&rdquo; Little said. &ldquo;Hopefully, he&rsquo;s more open-minded these days. Someone in that position has to be sensitive to the needs of immigrants in his care rather than showing disdain.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				After Rozos&rsquo; comments were published, The Herald called for his dismissal in an editorial titled &ldquo;Bucketful of Bigotry.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;Lady Liberty shed a tear the other day when a Krome Avenue detention center official, in a USA Today interview, called some Krome detainees &lsquo;scumbuckets,&rsquo;&rdquo; the editorial said. &ldquo;Mike Rozos, a deputy administrator at the Immigration and Naturalization Service facility, ought to have his career put in a bucket for that slander.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rozos is currently deputy assistant director for removals at ICE but is on temporary detail in Atlanta as interim field office director. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rozos is expected here in two to three months.
