			<h1>
				<a href="https://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4657164.html">Woman&rsquo;s Suit Says She Was Held as Slave in Rochester</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Randy Furst, Star Tribune (MN), Mar. 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				ROCHESTER, MINN. &mdash; Ejine Francisca Uzonwanne said she was forced to shovel snow with a clipboard because the woman she worked for had no shovel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 25-year-old woman alleges a lot more in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis last week, claiming she was enslaved for nearly four years by a relative who was a physician at the Mayo Clinic after she came to the United States from her native Nigeria. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The doctor, Julie Berny George, worked at the Mayo from November 2001 to April 2003. She has since moved to California. The Star Tribune was not able to find her for comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When we had a disagreement, she&rsquo;d say she&rsquo;d kill me and throw me away and nobody would find out because nobody knows me,&rdquo; Uzonwanne said this week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Uzonwanne, who is known by her friends as Franca, said George, her second cousin, repeatedly threatened to turn her in to immigration authorities and have her deported.
