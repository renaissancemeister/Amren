			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Meeting opposition in both major parties, President Bush&rsquo;s plan to ease immigration laws goes nowhere in Congress. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Ron Hutcheson, herald.com (Miami), Mar. 4 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>LOS ANGELES &mdash; </b>President Bush&rsquo;s plan to ease immigration laws is dead on arrival in Congress, doomed by opposition from Republicans who think it goes too far and Democrats who think it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although White House officials had hoped the plan would boost Bush&rsquo;s standing with Hispanics, it has turned out to be a flop. Some of the strongest opposition comes from the president&rsquo;s fellow Republicans, especially in California and other states with large immigrant populations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The hostile reaction will put Bush in an awkward position when he welcomes Mexican President Vicente Fox for a two-day visit to his Texas ranch starting Friday. Two months after Bush announced his intention to ease immigration laws, he has little to show for it other than criticism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The White House plan would let an estimated eight million workers who are in the country illegally gain legal status as part of a new guest-worker program. Immigrants would receive temporary work visas for up to three years at a time, with a still-to-be-determined number of extensions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rdquo;It was an absolute flop,&rdquo; said Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., an outspoken opponent of the president&rsquo;s plan. &rdquo;His proposal is going nowhere.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even those who are sympathetic to Bush&rsquo;s approach agree that it won&rsquo;t pass Congress this year. Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an organization that favors less-restrictive immigration laws, said the president needs a second term to have any hope of pushing his idea through Congress. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Democrats and leading Hispanic organizations criticized the plan for failing to put illegal workers on a fast track to citizenship. Instead, the president insisted that the workers eventually return to their home countries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The temporary-visa proposal also failed to calm critics at the other end of the ideological spectrum, who see it as an open-door policy for illegal workers. The issue is particularly sensitive in California, the top destination for illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike Spence, the president of the California Republican Assembly, which bills itself as the state&rsquo;s largest Republican volunteer organization, said many California Republicans considered the proposal an amnesty plan for illegal workers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The opposition isn&rsquo;t limited to California Republicans. A nationwide Gallup poll conducted shortly after the president announced his plan found that 55 percent of Americans opposed it. Hispanics were more receptive, but hardly unanimous in their support. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another poll, by Bendixen &amp; Associates, a Miami-based firm, found Hispanics evenly divided: 45 percent in favor, 45 percent opposed and 10 percent undecided. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Both polls had a margin of error of three percentage points. 
			</p>
			<p>
				White House aides said Bush wouldn&rsquo;t back down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rdquo;It&rsquo;s an important priority for the president,&rdquo; White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. &ldquo;This is about addressing an important economic need. It&rsquo;s also about bringing about a more humane migration policy. He remains firmly committed to it.&rdquo;
