			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Parents who take their daughters abroad to undergo female circumcision will face up to 14 years in jail under new measures that have come into force. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Mar. 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some ethnic minority communities have evaded the law by arranging for girls to have the operation abroad. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the Female Genital Mutilation Act makes this illegal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;No cultural, medical or other reason can ever justify a practice that causes so much pain and suffering,&rdquo; Home Secretary David Blunkett said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Very harmful practice&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was speaking at a support centre in north-west London, after he and Home Office minister Baroness Scotland met some women who have undergone circumcision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Female genital mutilation is a very harmful practice that is already rightly illegal in this country,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Regardless of cultural background, it is completely unacceptable and should be illegal wherever it takes place. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The legislation which comes into force today will close a loophole in the previous law by preventing people taking young girls abroad to carry out female genital mutilation and bring us closer to eradicating this practice entirely.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Blunkett said he expected to see prosecutions as a result of the new law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Protecting women from genital mutilation could also be taken into account in asylum claims by women, he said, providing they followed official routes to enter the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He stressed that enforcing the law would rely on the vigilance of teachers, health and social workers, in partnership with voluntary organisations and the communities involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They must be brave enough to take it head-on,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Where doctors come across this kind of mutilation, they have a duty to take actions in reporting it but also to help the young people themselves.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Female genital mutilation involves surgically removing the clitoris and sometimes parts of the labia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Experts believe 74,000 first-generation African immigrant women in the UK have undergone female circumcision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rahmat Mohammad, of the women&rsquo;s rights group Forward, said an estimated 7,000 girls in the UK were currently at risk of being forced into the procedure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Support the parents&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				She believes the number of cases Forward sees is rising despite a long-running campaign in UK communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a law where it is used to remove the child from the parents; we want to be able to support the parents so they will protect their own children.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Circumcision is usually performed on girls between four and 13 years old, but can be inflicted on newborn babies or young women before marriage or pregnancy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Reasons given include custom and tradition, religious demand, hygiene and prevention of promiscuity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Blunkett gave government backing to a private member&rsquo;s bill, introduced by Ann Clwyd MP, amending the law to make it unlawful to take girls abroad for &ldquo;female genital mutilation&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It increased penalties from five to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Female genital mutilation is common among Somali, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Yemeni, Malaysian and Indonesian communities.
