			<h1>
				Senate Kills Ban of Affirmative Action
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Kyle Henley, gazette.com (CO), Mar. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				DENVER &mdash; Affirmative action is alive and well in Colorado after the Colorado Senate on Friday narrowly defeated legislation aimed at eliminating the long-standing civil rights initiative. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Senate Bill 194 was sponsored by Sen. Ed Jones, a Colorado Springs Republican and one of two black state senators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Senators voted 18-17 to kill the bill, which would have barred government from using race as a factor in university admissions, hiring and contracting. All members of the El Paso County Senate delegation supported the bill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republican Sen. Lew Entz from Hooper voted with Democrats. Entz said he voted on behalf of his district, which is heavily Hispanic and benefits from affirmative action. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We do not deny that racism and discrimination exists,&rdquo; said Jones, whose impassioned voice boomed through the Senate during the debate. &ldquo;But we do not stop racism with more discrimination.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones argued affirmative action no longer is needed and doing away with it would be a &ldquo;small step toward a colorblind society&rdquo; in Colorado. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones could not convince his fellow senators, however, that getting rid of affirmative action is a good thing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Affirmative action has never been about preferential or special rights,&rdquo; said Sen. Paula Sandoval, D-Denver. &ldquo;It is about leveling the playing field. It allows diversity to occur on our college campuses, our corporations and even here on the Senate floor.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				News of the bill&rsquo;s defeat was greeted with joy by some black leaders in Colorado Springs, who had harshly criticized Jones during recent weeks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is just good news,&rdquo; said the Rev. Benjamin Reynolds, president of the local NAACP chapter and a local minister. &ldquo;We are excited about it because it would have set people of color back in Colorado instead of helping us achieve a level playing field.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Race is used sparingly in Colorado as a factor for university admissions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At Colorado&rsquo;s major schools &mdash; the University of Colorado&rsquo;s four campuses and Colorado State University in Fort Collins &mdash; admission standards mostly are based on high school grades and standardized test scores. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In some cases, however, admissions officials do take into account a combination of race, financial status, geography and other factors for students who do not score high enough on tests. There are no quotas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state of Colorado does not use race as a factor for job applicants, but some counties and cities, such as Denver, give preference to minorities for jobs and contracts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colorado Springs city officials never took a stand against the bill &mdash; the city does not use race as a factor for hiring &mdash; but were concerned it would stop efforts to recruit qualified minority job candidates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sen. Mark Hillman, R-Burlington, added an amendment to clear up those concerns, allowing local government to continue minority recruitment programs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I want them to be able to go out and let them know about these opportunities,&rdquo; Hillman said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sen. Peter Groff, D-Denver, said the amendment cleared up some ambiguities but the bill still was &ldquo;shrouded in ambiguities.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Groff, who is black, said the bill was superfluous. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is unnecessary because it is based on a series of dangerous and flawed assumptions,&rdquo; Groff said. &ldquo;This bill assumes racism doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;
