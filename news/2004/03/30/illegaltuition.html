				<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/metro/20040326-112657-7084r.htm">Democratic Study Hits Tuition Bill</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Robert Redding Jr., Wash. Times, Mar. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				ANNAPOLIS &mdash; The House has passed a bill that would allow illegal aliens to pay in-state tuition, despite a study conducted for the Democratic-controlled chamber that showed most Marylanders oppose such a measure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The unscientific study, obtained by The Washington Times, was paid for by Democrats in the General Assembly&rsquo;s Montgomery County delegation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The findings were compiled from questionnaires mailed to 30,000 Democratic, Republican and independent Maryland voters who were asked whether they supported granting illegal aliens &ldquo;the lower in-state tuition rates available to U.S. Citizens and legal residents.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the 903 total respondents, 462 said they did not support granting the lower tuition. It was an unscientific survey and did not compute a margin for error. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The survey also included questions about such key General Assembly issues as slot machines and health care. 
			</p>
			<p>
				House Majority Leader Kumar P. Barve, Senate Deputy Majority Whip Jennie M. Forehand and Delegates Luiz R. S. Simmons and Michael R. Gordon, Montgomery Democrats, paid for the $8,000 study with campaign donations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The delegates voted Thursday in favor of granting illegal aliens the benefit to receive in-state tuition to Maryland schools. The Senate has yet to vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill allows illegal aliens to pay in-state tuition rates as long as they have graduated from Maryland high schools, proven their families have paid taxes and promise to become U.S. citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Barve said the study was initiated in January &mdash; as it has been for the last 10 years &mdash; and is meant only to give lawmakers an idea about what constituents think, not to dictate how the lawmakers should vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is more a vehicle to invite people to our town hall meeting so that we can listen to them,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Barve said he takes voter input seriously. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I was probably voting against it until they changed the bill at the last minute and required that [the illegal aliens] pay taxes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I listen to my constituents, but legislation changes as the session goes on.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Barve also said he agrees with his constituents on a &ldquo;vast majority&rdquo; of issues and is confident that on election day &ldquo;they are going to take my entire record and weigh it and balance it and decide whether they are going to vote for me.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republicans who have been fighting for more stringent laws on illegal immigration were outraged about how the Democrats voted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When you ask your constituents how they feel, and they tell you how they feel, and you vote opposite to that, it just tells you [the three delegates] do not respect their own constituents,&rdquo; said Delegate Richard K. Impallaria, Harford Republican. &ldquo;We are taking about the most liberal [county] in the state of Maryland and [the residents] don&rsquo;t support in-state tuition for illegal aliens.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Delegate Pat McDonough, Baltimore County Republican, said the Democrats who voted in favor of the tuition break were trying to win over Hispanic voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. McDonough and Mr. Impallaria have been unsuccessful in their efforts to crack down on illegal aliens, which includes the defeat of a bill that would have allowed the incarceration of illegal aliens as soon as they are identified. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Three of the House&rsquo;s 43 Republicans voted for the bill, which passed with a veto-proof 88-to-53 majority. Thirteen Democrats voted against the bill, which now goes to the Senate for final approval. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The General Assembly last year passed a similar bill, but it was vetoed by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Ehrlich&rsquo;s spokesman Henry P. Fawell said the governor is concerned about certain rights of citizens being extended to &ldquo;non-citizens who are here illegally.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The governor is not enthusiastic about the overall message that this legislation sends,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				House Republicans and Democrats put aside partisan differences yesterday long enough to give unanimous approval to Mr. Ehrlich&rsquo;s $6 billion budget. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The budget has already passed the Senate, but there are numerous differences that must be resolved in the final 16 days of the 2004 General Assembly session. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The budget disagreements may not be difficult to work out, but negotiations between the two houses will be complicated by a major difference between the Senate and House on taxes and Mr. Ehrlich&rsquo;s slot machine bill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The House added a $670 million tax package to a second bill that will be required to keep the budget balanced without deep cuts in state services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Ehrlich and the Senate proposed much more modest revenue measures, and the governor has said he would veto the bill if it contains the House tax package.
