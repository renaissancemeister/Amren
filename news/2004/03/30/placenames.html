			<h1>
				Bills Target Racially Offensive Place Names
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jim Reeder, Palm Beach Post, Mar. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two proposed state laws could change some Florida place names, replacing racially offensive epithets with names more acceptable by today&rsquo;s standards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The issue divides proponents who say the offensive names are a &ldquo;needless irritant&rdquo; and others who fear changing place names will cause us to lose parts of our history. 
			</p>
			<p>
				State Sen. Steven Geller, D-Hallandale Beach, introduced a bill requiring state agencies and local governments to identify offensive names and find suitable replacements. Local governments would decide which features in their area should be changed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rep. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, has introduced a similar bill in the House. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m suggesting is local governments look at potentially offensive names,&rdquo; Geller said. &ldquo;They would change them themselves, and I&rsquo;m not saying the state should dictate changes.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bills are making their way through legislative committees in Tallahassee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Treasure Coast has four of 13 derogatory name sites in Florida. The names are listed in the Geographic Name Information System, maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 1987 St. Lucie County property appraiser&rsquo;s map shows Nigger Jim Scrub, 600 acres of woods near the Okeechobee County line south of SR 70. A wall map published by a private company in 1988 shows Niggerhead Point on the St. Lucie River in Port St. Lucie, but Negro Cove on the Indian River Lagoon in Martin County. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The federal government changed such names in 1963 and topographical maps now show Negro Jim Scrub, Negro Head Point and Negro Cut, a water passage near Jack Island State Park. A Web site lists the more offensive names as a variation of the modern ones. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether the &ldquo;newer&rdquo; names are acceptable may be a matter for more debate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I asked black legislators if Negro is offensive, and they said it is,&rdquo; Geller said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Former St. Lucie County Commissioner Havert Fenn, who is black, said he doesn&rsquo;t find Negro offensive. The other form of the word should be removed from maps and place names, Fenn said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s degrading,&rdquo; Fenn said. &ldquo;This day and age those kinds of things should not continue. I hope they will disappear.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Geller said he&rsquo;s received angry letters accusing him of trying to change county names such as Dixie, Lee and Jackson. &ldquo;The Sons of Confederate Veterans haven&rsquo;t read my bill,&rdquo; Geller said. &ldquo;Those names are not racially offensive.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nor would he ban the use of Negro if it&rsquo;s not aimed at a person or racial group. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Rio Negro is from the Spanish, but you can&rsquo;t tell me Negrotown is from Spain,&rdquo; Geller said. &ldquo;What do you think that name was originally?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				St. Lucie County&rsquo;s Historical Commission discussed the issue several years ago after receiving a complaint about Niggerhead Point across the St. Lucie River from Club Med, according to former member and historian Lucille Rights. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A commission member who was black said he wasn&rsquo;t offended, and we shouldn&rsquo;t take history away,&rdquo; Rights said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She fears such history will be lost if place names are changed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make history so sterile that we don&rsquo;t remember these people,&rdquo; she said.
