			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Others are expected to be disciplined over lapses that have endangered or led to the deaths of patients. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Steve Hymon and Charles Ornstein, L. A. Times, Mar. 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Los Angles County officials are in the process of firing five top leaders at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center &mdash; including the hospital&rsquo;s administrator &mdash; in response to mounting troubles at the public hospital in Willowbrook, according to people familiar with the dismissals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The termination notices follow a series of disclosures about lapses in care at King/Drew that have endangered patients and, according to government inspectors, contributed to at least five deaths in the last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Supervisor Don Knabe said that the terminations represented an unusually large purge of a county institution. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Usually you lose a CEO or one or two of the top people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But King/Drew has significant issues. It just can&rsquo;t go on like it has been. If you look at the history of some of the investigations and lawsuits, it was the same ol&rsquo;, same ol&rsquo;, and nothing was changing.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The county is sending termination notices to Willie T. May, King/Drew&rsquo;s chief executive; associate medical director Dr. Alfred Forrest; nursing director Rosemary Haggins; and one of her top assistants, said those familiar with the firings, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				County officials also have sent a letter of termination to Dr. Arthur Fleming, who presided over the training of aspiring surgeons last year when a national body stripped the program of its accreditation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fred Leaf, chief operating officer of the county health department, informed the Board of Supervisors in writing Friday that the department had started notifying &ldquo;a number of senior managers at King/Drew&rdquo; that they would be fired. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neither he nor his boss, health director Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, would comment further on who was terminated or why, citing confidentiality restrictions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the actions were applauded by some of the facility&rsquo;s supporters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Something has to be done to save the hospital,&rdquo; said state Assemblyman Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), who heads the Assembly special committee looking into King/Drew. &ldquo;Obviously some drastic action has to be taken, and some people are going to be very unhappy. They&rsquo;re moving in the right direction.&rdquo;
