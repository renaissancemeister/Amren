			</h1>

				Census Bureau sees non-Hispanic white population at 50 percent 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>MSNBC, Mar. 17 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; The U.S. Census Bureau is predicting that the nation&rsquo;s Asian and Hispanic populations will triple by 2050 while the population of non-Hispanic whites increases by just 7 percent. As a result, the non-Hispanic white population will drop to half of the total from a current level of close to 70 percent, the report said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, the Census Bureau projected the U.S. population will continue to grow, increasing from 282 million in 2000 to 420 million in 2050. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;However, after 2030 the rate of increase might be the slowest since the Great Depression of the 1930s as the size of the &lsquo;baby boom&rsquo; population continues to decline,&rdquo; the Bureau said in a statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Projections for 2050 include these: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>The Asian population</strong> rises from 10.7 million to 33.4 million, a 213 percent increase. Their share of the nation&rsquo;s population would double, from 3.8 percent to 8 percent. </li>
				<li> <strong>The Hispanic population</strong> rises from 36 million to 103 million, a 188 percent increase. Their share of the nation&rsquo;s population nearly doubles, from 12.6 percent to 24.4 percent. </li>
				<li> <strong>The black population</strong> rises from 36 million to 61 million in 2050, a 71 percent increase. That would raise their share of the country&rsquo;s population from 12.7 percent to 14.6 percent. </li>
				<li> <strong>The non-Hispanic, white population </strong>rises from 196 million to 210 million, a 7 percent increase. This group is projected to actually lose population in the 2040s and would comprise just 50.1 percent of the total population in 2050, compared with 69.4 percent in 2000. </li>
				<li> <strong>The overall population becomes older.</strong> &ldquo;Childbearing rates are expected to remain low while baby-boomers &mdash; people born between 1946 and 1964 &mdash; begin to turn 65 in 2011,&rdquo; the Bureau noted. &ldquo;By 2030, about 1-in-5 people would be 65 or over.&rdquo; </li>
				<li> <strong>The female population</strong> continues to outnumber the male population by a slight margin. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The Bureau said its projections are based on Census 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality and international migration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It noted that the projected 49 percent population increase by 2050 &ldquo;would be in sharp contrast to most European countries, whose populations are expected to decline by mid-century.&rdquo;
