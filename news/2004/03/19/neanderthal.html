				No evidence of interbreeding between primitive humans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Michael Hopkin, Nature, Mar. 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				If our early ancestors did breed with their Neanderthal cousins, they didn&rsquo;t make a habit of it, according to the largest-ever study of early human DNA. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Researchers compared the preserved remains of four Neanderthals and five early modern humans found throughout Western Europe. DNA from the two sets of samples was distinct enough to rule out large amounts of mixing between the two. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We detected no evidence of interbreeding,&rdquo; says David Serre of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who took part in the study. But he adds that, because of the scarcity of well-preserved DNA, it is impossible to be certain that such trysts never took place. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neanderthals vanished from Europe between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago, roughly the time that truly modern man made his first appearance in the region. Researchers have been divided over whether the two groups ever came face to face &mdash; and if they did, whether relations were hostile or harmonious. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Family ties 
			</p>
			<p>
				Serre and his colleagues set out to shed light on this question by examining sequences of mitochondrial DNA taken from fossils. These sequences are passed virtually intact from mother to offspring &mdash; if Neanderthals and modern humans interbred, the sequences would be expected to overlap between the two groups. But the sequences were entirely distinct, the researchers report in <i>PLoS Biology</i><sup>1</sup>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an advance,&rdquo; says Chris Stringer, who studies early humans at Britain&rsquo;s Natural History Museum in London. The finding supports the theory that our earliest European ancestors replaced Neanderthals, rather than mixing to form a single group that eventually gave rise to the people of today, he says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But it&rsquo;s not yet fully clear how this process unfolded: did modern humans bully their slow-witted neighbours to extinction, or did the Neanderthals die out and leave us to inherit an empty landscape? 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think DNA can answer this question,&rdquo; says Serre. Although the two groups seem to have been genetically separate, the fossil record is too patchy, and dating methods too unreliable, to say whether this was because they never met, or because they simply didn&rsquo;t consider each other an enticing proposition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the small number of fossils studied, it&rsquo;s also possible that interbreeding did occur, he adds, but that we have not found the evidence yet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Such a match-up would have been genetically feasible, says Stringer. The two groups were closer in genetic terms than other primates that happily breed today, he says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Physically, however, they were very distinct, he adds. Perhaps the Neanderthals&rsquo; thickset build and furrowed brow were just too different for romance to blossom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So what did happen to the Neanderthals? Stringer points out that Europe&rsquo;s climate was very unstable at around the time of their demise. This, combined with the arrival of a cunning new competitor in modern man, could have conspired to wipe them out. &ldquo;If the climate had been stable, perhaps the two could have overlapped for some time,&rdquo; Stringer speculates. &ldquo;In my view, the Neanderthals were just unlucky.&rdquo;
