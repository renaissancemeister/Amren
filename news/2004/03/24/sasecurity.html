				<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3519352.stm">South Africa&rsquo;s Growing Private Army</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Crime has become big business in South Africa, and so has fighting it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Franz Kruger, BBC Johannesburg, Mar. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a kind of mirror image of the syndicates operating in various sectors of the underworld, an industry has developed to service people&rsquo;s fear of being hijacked or robbed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wherever there is a criminal opportunity, there is another in protection. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tucked in between an arrangement of office pot plants there&rsquo;s a startling sign: &ldquo;Keep off: Infantry bush game reserve: snakes and dangerous animals around.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And indeed, there are animals: some plastic snakes twisted around the dusty leaves, while a few goldfish stare balefully out of a murky fish tank. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These are the Brakpan offices of the Anti Crime Force Training Academy and Guard Division. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With energy and imagination to make up for a lack of resources, owner George Morake has tried to create a military atmosphere. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The walls are festooned with flags and plastic replicas of the tools of the trade, walkie talkies, handcuffs and guns. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Crime profits&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The academy offers the most basic qualification as a security officer after just a week&rsquo;s training. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But for a special price of R300 ($45), Mr Morake offers a three-week training package to give them three qualifications, Grades E, D and C. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With those, they qualify for entry-level jobs in access control or security guarding that pay from R1,300 ($194) a month. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brian Adams, the vice-chair of the recently established Security Industries Alliance, says the industry turns over between R10 billion and R18 billion, depending on how you define it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are around 4,500 companies and entities, although a few very large companies &mdash; including some foreign-owned &mdash; dominate the sector. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are around 500,000 security guards, half of them employed in-house, the other half by security companies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The comparison with the police is quickly made. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The industry&rsquo;s turnover is not very far behind the police budget, which was just under R20 billion in 2003. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Worrisome state </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to a 1999 study by the Institute for Security Studies, there were then around four security guards for every uniformed member of the police engaged in visible policing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It almost amounts to a private army, and it makes the government a little uncomfortable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you take the entire complement of people who are under arms in the private security industry, it&rsquo;s larger than people who are in the armed forces of the country, and this is worrisome.&rdquo; says Security Minister Charles Nqakula. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Nqakula says he is not suggesting that the arms that these companies have will at some point be turned against the government, but he says the situation remains disconcerting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Mr Adams says most of the security guards are actually unarmed, and the government&rsquo;s concern is misplaced. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While there may be a small minority who are hostile to the government, the overwhelming majority want to work with the authorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no sense in &ldquo;looking for enemies behind every bush&rdquo;, he says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Crack troops </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s not hard to see the racial issues that add to this potent mix of tensions between private and public security. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who can afford private security &mdash; sometimes called Model C security &mdash; are largely white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The industry lives on a crime problem that has become a convenient stick to beat the government. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Out in a light industrial area in Pretoria, the distinctive green &ldquo;cash-in-transit&rdquo; vehicles of Fidelity Guards are returning to base at the end of the day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These guards are the industry&rsquo;s crack troops, well trained and well paid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They are also mostly white and include many former police, prisons and defence force officers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Soldier&rsquo;s stress </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Guard Johan Chamberlain was attacked by six armed men in the Atteridgeville post office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They got away with a cash box containing around R20,000 ($3,000). 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was his fourth robbery in three years, he says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Chamberlain is already on medication and seeing a psychologist twice a week to help him deal with the stress. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Nobody knows what stress you&rsquo;re live under. You look into a gun, and you see where the bullet is, and that bullet can come out at any moment and hit you right between the eyes,&rdquo; he says 
			</p>
			<p>
				If these are the private sector&rsquo;s elite troops in the war against crime, the recruits training at Morake&rsquo;s academy are the foot soldiers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Morake has already started another branch in Kempton Park, and dreams of setting up a proper barracks to run his training courses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The war on crime can be won,&rdquo; declares Mr Morake. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But for the foreseeable future, security is going to remain a growth industry in South Africa.
