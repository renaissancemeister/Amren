			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Africa Ka Mahamba, news24.com (SA), Mar. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johannesburg &mdash; The leader of a Pretoria-based youth organisation has issued a controversial statement by telling youth to go and steal from white people in the suburbs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Faraday Nkoane, the leader of Uhuru cultural club, told 100 youngsters who attended the Human Rights Day celebration at Lebanon township park to go and steal from the whites because &ldquo;it is the right thing to do. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Stop stealing from black people because they will deal with you in an African way. They will bewitch you and you will go crazy. The whites have stolen from us since April 6, 1652. Our ancestors&rsquo; cattle, goats, sheep, chickens and others are in the hands of the whites, while we are left with nothing. Go and steal from them because it is right. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Taking from whites is not a crime because you repossess what belongs to you. But make sure you are not caught,&rdquo; said Nkoane, addressing the youth, most of whom were in Rastafarian colours. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Daily Sun approached him about his controversial statement that would cause hatred between South Africans, Nkoane said he stood by his statement because &ldquo;nothing is wrong with it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Yes, nothing is wrong with my statement because the whites have stolen from the blacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My statement doesn&rsquo;t promote any hatred because I did not call for violence against the whites. I only told the youth to go and repossess from them. If youth steal in the township it is crime, but if they steal from whites in the suburbs, it is not a crime because they are merely repossessing,&rdquo; said Nkoane. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said he would not withdraw his statement because the government was doing nothing for unemployed youth.
