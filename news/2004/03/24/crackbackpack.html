				<a href="https://www.wishtv.com/global/story.asp?s=1731319&amp;ClientType=Printable">Police Search for Boy&rsquo;s Parents after Crack Incident</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>WISHTV-8 (IN), Mar. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are new developments as police continue to look for the parents of a four-year-old who they say took crack cocaine to school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the Head Start program on Meridian Street on the near north side, a teacher found thousands of dollars worth of crack cocaine Monday in the child&rsquo;s knapsack. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the boy&rsquo;s parents are wanted for narcotics investigation and possible child neglect. Police say the child&rsquo;s parents, Kenneth Green, 24, and Andrea Jackson, 23, have a criminal record. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police they say they&rsquo;ve found the couple&rsquo;s one-year-old son with his grandmother on the east side. He was not hurt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It all started when a teacher caught their four-year-old son showing off a bag of cocaine. The boy had told his friends it was flour. Police say it wasn&rsquo;t flour, but rather, $10,000 worth of crack cocaine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been my experience that if you have roots in this city, you&rsquo;re probably going to stay here. I mean, they&rsquo;ve got friends; their entire support network is here in Indianapolis, so the chance of them leaving town are pretty slim. And if they do, they have to come back,&rdquo; said Sergeant Steve Staletovich, IPD. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Marion County prosecutor&rsquo;s office is still deciding exactly what charges the parents will face. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Following the finding at the school police searched the boys home on the 400 block of West 41st Street. Although they found no one inside the home they say did stop a relative and officers say that relative&rsquo;s car smelled of pot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The four-year-old boy and one of his siblings are now in the custody of Child Protective Services.
