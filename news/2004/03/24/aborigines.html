			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Rebecca Hewitt, Northern Territory News news.com.au, Mar. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Aboriginal people were yesterday begged to stop committing crimes 
			</p>
			<p>
				Justice Minister Peter Toyne said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling on all indigenous people &hellip; stop breaking the law, for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the number of Aborigines in Territory jails was &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the minister said: &ldquo;If people continue to break the law, we have to continue to put them in jail.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr Toyne was speaking after the latest statistics showed that violent crime was on the increase in Darwin, Katherine and Tennant Creek. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At Katherine, 78 per cent of assaults were committed by indigenous people and 68 per cent of the victims were also Aboriginal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is despite the fact only a third of Katherine&rsquo;s population is indigenous. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 67 per cent of the assaults were committed while the assailant was drunk and a weapon was used in 42 per cent of cases. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr Toyne said the Territory Government would increase police numbers at Katherine by five, and encourage more co-operation between night patrols, police and indigenous communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is largely an issue of domestic violence, male on female,&rdquo; Dr Toyne said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty ugly picture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People have to know that this behaviour is not acceptable _ we have to improve community mobilisation against offenders.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The situation has improved at Alice Springs over the past year: compared with 2002, assaults decreased from 234 to 206 and sexual assaults fell from 19 to eight. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Property damage went down about 30 per cent and theft of or from motor vehicles fell by 38 per cent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But there was an increase in violent crime in Darwin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sexual assault increased by 33 per cent and assault went up by 10 per cent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But property crime continues to fall. Household and commercial break-ins decreased by 32 per cent since this time last year and motor vehicle thefts went down 22 per cent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very pleased to have consolidated the drop in property crime,&rdquo; Dr Toyne said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But with violent crime, we haven&rsquo;t made a significant impact.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Opposition Leader Terry Mills welcomed the drop in property crime but said violent crime continued to be the Territory&rsquo;s &ldquo;new problem&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;No wonder Territorians are fearful of their safety,&rdquo; he said.
