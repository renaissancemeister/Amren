			<h1>
				One Wife Rule Halts Hmong Immigration
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Aljazeera.Net, Mar. 1</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The United States&rsquo; reluctance to accept polygamy has emerged as a sticking point in plans to resettle more than 14,000 ethnic Hmong people. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Officials from the city of St Paul, Minnesota, began talks on Monday to finalise reception for thousands who fled communist Laos to find shelter in a Thai temple. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Mayor Randy Kelly&rsquo;s monogamy clause has turned out to be a big problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				General Pallop Pinmanee, of Thailand&rsquo;s Internal Security Operations Command has said he will meet with Kelly to discuss the only-one-wife condition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Many Hmongs have several wives. How can we separate family members?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pallop said a further &ldquo;problem is there are about 1000 senior Hmongs who don&rsquo;t want to go to the US. They want to stay at Tham Krabok which we can not allow.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Delegation visit</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tham Krabok, a Buddhist temple in central Thailand, houses about 14,400 refugees who were recently accepted for entry into the United States. More than half are destined for St Paul. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 20-member US delegation is scheduled to visit the camp on Tuesday, where residents are already undergoing tests to prove they are in good health and not addicted to drugs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A US embassy official said discussions were going well, but the delegation was now settling down to the &ldquo;nitty gritty&rdquo; of the resettlement process. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why the US?</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Minnesota has taken in tens of thousands of Hmong refugees in recognition of their help to US forces during the Vietnam war and the minority&rsquo;s subsequent persecution. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hmong at Tham Krabok are among the last of 300,000 who fled to Thailand after the communist takeover in Laos in 1975. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their presence has long been a thorny issue between Vientiane and Bangkok.
