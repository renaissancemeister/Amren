			<h1>
				Boxer Foes Court Bush, but Oppose Immigration Plan
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Bill Ainsworth, SignOnSanDiego, Mar. 1 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SACRAMENTO &mdash; The four candidates seeking the GOP nomination to run for the U.S. Senate have spent much of the campaign competing over who can be the president&rsquo;s closest ally, lavishing praise on his economic policies, boasting of personal ties and promising to deliver California to him in the fall. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet, on one issue &mdash; President Bush&rsquo;s plan to allow millions of illegal immigrants to have temporary legal status &mdash; the candidates have been willing to openly criticize the president. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That dynamic has even overshadowed their unity in attacking Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer. Tomorrow&rsquo;s primary will decide which candidate gets the right to challenge Boxer in November.. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a group, they&rsquo;ve taken a tougher stance on immigrants than the president, reflecting a split in the Republican Party between hard-liners and those wishing to accommodate illegal immigrants and their employers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The dispute could also be seen as a replay of differences between California and Texas Republicans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1994, many California Republicans, led by former Gov. Pete Wilson, took a tough stance, promoting Proposition 187, which sought to deny government services to illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ballot measure &mdash; passed but later overturned in court &mdash; soured relations between Republicans and Latino voters for years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By contrast, Bush, while governor of Texas, courted Latinos, enjoying good relations with voters and Mexican government officials. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush said his plan, announced last month, would make U.S. laws &ldquo;more rational and humane&rdquo; by allowing immigrants with a job to have a three-year renewable work permit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the plan, the immigrant gets a temporary worker card allowing him to travel back and forth to his home country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the four GOP candidates, former San Diego Assemblyman Howard Kaloogian has focused on social issues by trumpeting his opposition to abortion rights and gun control. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only does he back a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, but he has helped open a petition drive to recall Attorney General Bill Lockyer for not moving quickly enough to stop same-sex marriages in San Francisco. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kaloogian called the president&rsquo;s immigration plan unworkable because it will encourage more immigration, and immoral because it rewards those who didn&rsquo;t follow the nation&rsquo;s laws. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have to be a good friend to the president, and let him know this plan is bad for our state and bad for our country,&rdquo; Kaloogian said. 
			</p>
			<h4>
				Bashing immigration Various ideas
			</h4>
			<p>
				Kaloogian wants to crack down on illegal immigrants in a variety of ways. At the Republican party convention earlier this month, he led a rally against efforts by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to find a compromise with Democrats that would grant driver licenses to illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Legislature has repealed a broad bill allowing driver licenses for illegal immigrants at the governor&rsquo;s behest, contending it was a bad, politically motivated measure. Schwarzenegger has said he will consider signing a similar bill if it addresses security issues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kaloogian also has proposed requiring those who send money electronically from the United States to a foreign country to prove they are here legally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rival Toni Casey, the former mayor of Los Altos Hills, said she was so impressed with Bush that after hearing him speak during the 2000 presidential election she switched her party registration from Democrat to Republican. Later, she worked for him in the Small Business Administration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet, she said, she opposes the president&rsquo;s plan because she believes it amounts to amnesty for illegal immigrants, and prefers a guest-worker program instead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We cannot have open borders,&rdquo; Casey said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Front-runner Bill Jones, who switched his endorsement of Bush during the 2000 Republican primary season to Arizona&rsquo;s Sen. John McCain, has been trying to get back in the good graces of the Bush administration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During a recent debate, he pledged to campaign hard on behalf of Bush in the fall to help him win a state he lost by 1.3 million votes in 2000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet he expressed doubts about the Bush immigration plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I compliment the president for bringing the issue up, but I don&rsquo;t think the measure fits California,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones said any comprehensive immigration plan must include money to reimburse California for state government costs associated with illegal immigration. He also said such a plan needs to bolster U.S. patrols along the border with Mexico. 
			</p>
			<h4>
				Rise of hard-liners Former Mexican
			</h4>
			<p>
				Former U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin, who emigrated from Mexico when she was 14, has portrayed herself as a close ally of the president. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The candidate quickly endorsed the president&rsquo;s call for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages, worked for his tax cuts and said she has a relationship based on &ldquo;trust, confidence and friendship.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Marin said she opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants, and believes the solution is to put more pressure on Mexico to improve its economy through lowering taxes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In California we are continuing being the repository of Mexico&rsquo;s unemployment line,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republican analyst Allan Hoffenblum said the division between the Senate candidates and Bush reflects some anger against immigrants in California. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think you saw candidates playing to their audience,&rdquo; he said after a debate at the state Republican convention earlier this month in Burlingame. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also said that hard-liners might be on the rise within a Republican Party that has tried for years to win back Latino voters turned off by Proposition 187 in 1994. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Some of us said we thought we learned our lesson in 1994,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But now some hard-core immigrant-bashers are creeping back.&rdquo;
