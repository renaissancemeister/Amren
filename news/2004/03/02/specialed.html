			<h1>
				State: Disproportionate Number of Blacks in Special Ed
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Deborah Bulkeley, AP, Clarion-Ledger (MS), Mar. 1</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mississippi education officials say they are aware a disproportionate number of black children have been routed to special-education programs in public schools and are working to correct the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Discrimination is likely one reason, but educators say the root of the problem goes much deeper. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It most certainly is a national issue of grave concern to all of us,&rdquo; said Jane Browning, executive director of the Learning Disability Association of America. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more complicated than a simple case of racial prejudice.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Melody Bounds, director of the Office of Special Education at the Mississippi Department of Education, said cases where unusually high numbers of black children are assigned to special-education programs are more obvious in Southern states, &ldquo;but we do have the largest population of black students as well.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The biggest issue is making sure we have schools that are responsive to the needs of all students,&rdquo; Bounds said. &ldquo;Making sure good instruction is taking place, making sure teachers know how to differentiate instruction to satisfy of a diverse group of learners.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said educators must make sure the assessment technique used to identify students with disabilities is nondiscrimina-tory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Department of Education figures reviewed by The Associated Press show blacks, who account for only slightly more than half of the state&rsquo;s public school population, made up about 54 percent of students ages 6 to 21 in special-education programs during 2002, the most current year for which data is available. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, blacks accounted for about two-thirds of the so-called self-contained students &mdash; those who spend at least 60 percent of the school day outside regular classrooms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mississippi mirrors a national trend. In 2002, about 12 percent of the nation&rsquo;s black children ages 6 to 21 received special-education services, compared with about 8 percent of Hispanic and 9 percent of white students, according to the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nationally, an estimated 10 million blacks ages 6 to 21 made up about 15 percent of the nation&rsquo;s population in 2002 but accounted for about 31 percent of the self-contained special education population, according to the OSEP documents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, these students were more likely to be classified as having a severe disability &mdash; such as mental retardation or emotional disturbance &mdash; than children of other races. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gwendolyn Webb-Johnson, assistant professor of special education at the University of Texas at Austin, said many black students are mislabeled because of a lack of cultural understanding. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Special education is a service, but it becomes a place to remove kids that are a challenge,&rdquo; said Webb-Johnson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier, unfortunately in our school systems, to remove African-American children, and place them in special education &hellip; away from the general education population.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Browning said socioeconomic status plays a part because black children are more likely to be poor than white children; and poor children are less likely to receive early-childhood resources such as reading at home or preschool. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A child starting first grade without having that educational background could be placed in special education, instead of getting extra help to catch up, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Browning said early intervention can greatly reduce, or in some cases eliminate the impact of a learning disability on a child&rsquo;s academic career. 
			</p>
			<p>
				LeRon Jackson, a Jackson State University student with cerebral palsy, knows firsthand the challenges many black students with disabilities faced in public schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jackson, who takes a warm smile and his wheelchair to schools and businesses across Mississippi to promote an understanding of people with disabilities, says there have been positive changes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 25-year-old sophomore said in high school a substitute teacher who asked him if he&rsquo;d lost his way from the special-education classroom. Jackson started his elementary school education in self-contained classes before his mother, Hollia Johnson, found out he could be placed him in a regular education setting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I got a fuller education when I got out of self-contained classes,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I was getting taught more at home than while in the (self-contained) special-education class.&rdquo;
