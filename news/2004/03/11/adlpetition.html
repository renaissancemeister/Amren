			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Louis Calabro</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				It appears that the Anti-Defamation League and others, through purposeful selective writings, publications and videos have, themselves, become an Anti-European American diatribe that has resulted in hate speech and hate crimes against European Americans in cities throughout the US. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many European Americans believe that the Anti-Defamation League is a hate group working to falsely portray European Americans as the purveyors of racial animus, and the perpetrators of hate crimes and all others as our victims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If not, why would they author a book called &ldquo;Hate Hurts &hellip;&rdquo; and push it in our schools when it falsely portrays European Americans as THE haters? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Why would they refuse to allow European Americans to join a coalition of &ldquo;minority&rdquo; groups fighting hatred because they say &ldquo;historically only minorities have been the victims of hate crimes&rdquo;? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Why would they run a full page ad listing victims of hatred, but exclude European Americans? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Why would the ADL Director state &ldquo;&hellip; frankly, hate crimes against European [American]s is not the burning issue of the day,&rdquo; when whites were actually most often victims of racially motivated multiple assailant street attacks in San Francisco? 
			</p>
			<p>
				And, why would reporter Matt Issacs write an in-depth investigative article about the Anti Defamation League for the SF Weekly, February 2-8 2000 titled, &ldquo;Spy vs. Spite&rdquo; wherein he asks the question &ldquo;&hellip; should a group who spied on thousands of Californians be allowed to police the web [for kids]?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Use of extreme selective writings, publications and videos of excessive violence against all racial groups except for a few European Americans at the urging of the Anti-Defamation League and others in their portrayal, displays a clear prejudicial bent against European Americans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				United States law documents that &ldquo;bias related&rdquo; or a &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; means a &ldquo;designated act that demonstrates an accused&rsquo;s prejudice based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, family responsibility, physical handicap, matriculation, or political affiliation of a victim of the subject designated act.&rdquo; State and Federal statutes may apply. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We implore US Attorney General John Ashcroft, and the US Department of Justice to evaluate the anti-European American materials that are clearly present in their writings, books, videos and teachings, and ask that civil, criminal, and Federal hate-crime laws be utilized not only against the perpetrators involved in each and every act which has been encouraged, but against the authors, directors, producers, and screen writers responsible.
