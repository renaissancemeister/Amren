			<p>
				WEST HAVEN &mdash; A provocative speech about racial injustice prompted dozens of white students at West Haven High School to walk out of the assembly in protest Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the majority of juniors and seniors who stayed in the auditorium stood and cheered speaker Jeffrey Johnson, saying he told the unpleasant truth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He spoke about stuff that people sugarcoat,&rdquo; said Gary Gregory, a 16-year-old junior. &ldquo;If people can&rsquo;t handle it, they can&rsquo;t handle it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johnson, president of Speaking Truth to Power Co. in Baltimore, was in town to be the guest speaker at tonight&rsquo;s West Haven Black Coalition&rsquo;s annual awards banquet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 30-year-old national activist sparked jeers by some students when he talked about &ldquo;the system&rdquo; that sends young black men into prison and special-education classes rather than to college. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Young black boys are targeted by these systems,&rdquo; he said, citing the &ldquo;systematic racism in place.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The tension hit its high point when Johnson said that black boys are often suspended and expelled from school for breaking rules, while &ldquo;white boys go back to class.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The comments brought thunderous applause from black students, but an almost all-white group of students walked out of the auditorium. Many of the remaining students showered their classmates with boos and taunts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johnson continued to talk over the pandemonium. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If people want to walk out &mdash; peace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to down anybody. I&rsquo;m here to be honest. This is time for us to learn together. This isn&rsquo;t about offending anyone.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless, some students, most of them white, said Johnson&rsquo;s remarks were inappropriate and racially divisive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; said Ronnie Baia. &ldquo;If anything, he should be saying how we should be one.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Emily Dargo, 16, disagreed with Johnson that blacks live in a world that doesn&rsquo;t want to see them succeed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That (kind of comment) doesn&rsquo;t help the racial situation in this school,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One black student who joined those who walked out, Hannibal Gibson, 17, said he doesn&rsquo;t believe the system treats blacks differently than it does whites. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Other black students, however, embraced Johnson&rsquo;s words. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think he was great,&rdquo; said Ulesha Howard, 17. &ldquo;To me, he was saying stuff no one else wanted to say. He was educating us.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Melvin Campbell, 17, said Johnson&rsquo;s speech was &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; and that those who walked out showed intolerance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Some people who walked out were my friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My friends who did stay, I look up to them a lot more.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sara Hicks, a sophomore, drew up a petition stating that the walkout was disrespectful and that administrators were wrong not to punish those involved. One hundred students signed the document, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We disagree with what our teachers say and we just can&rsquo;t get up and walk out of class,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Principal Ron Stancil said Johnson gave an &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;inspiring&rdquo; speech, but disagreed with Johnson&rsquo;s statement that black students are punished more harshly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;West Haven High School has one set of rules,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Stancil could not be reached for comment about the petition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johnson, a tall, thin man with tied-back dreadlocks, said no one has ever walked out of one of his lectures before. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It challenged us to do what&rsquo;s necessary, but it&rsquo;s disappointing because there were things they could have learned.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johnson, who plays &ldquo;Cousin Jeff&rdquo; on Black Entertainment Television&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rap City,&rdquo; chided black teenagers who carry backpacks with no books inside and who try to act like &ldquo;gang-bangers&rdquo; when they&rsquo;ve never left the suburbs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The former national youth and college director for the NAACP, Johnson said American society spends money to build new jails but not to fix broken-down schools, where students learn a limited amount about black history. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I love (the Rev. Martin Luther) King, but King wasn&rsquo;t the only person who contributed to black history,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Young black kids &hellip; don&rsquo;t know their own history.

			</p>
			<p>
				WEST HAVEN &mdash; A racially critical editorial in the West Haven Voice prompted the head of the West Haven Black Coalition to call for a boycott of all businesses that advertise in the weekly paper. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We need to stop doing business with them,&rdquo; coalition President Carroll E. Brown told a small group at the House of Jacob Church Tuesday night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brown called the community awareness meeting to discuss the editorial and the controversy that a black guest speaker created at West Haven High School on Feb. 23. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About two dozen white students walked out in protest of a speech by former NAACP youth leader Jeffrey Johnson, a Black History Month speaker who talked about unfair treatment of blacks in society. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The walkout in turn created racial tension at the school, particularly by black students demanding punishment for those who walked out of the assembly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The editorial, written by Voice Editor and Publisher Bill Riccio Jr., called Johnson a &ldquo;race pimp&rdquo; who blamed whites for black people&rsquo;s problems. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brown, who passed out copies of the paper at the meeting, said the editorial was &ldquo;an attack on the whole African-American community.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We should all be enraged,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Riccio, who has written numerous articles critical of Brown, questioned why Brown went after his advertisers rather than discussing the editorial with him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to put myself in a defensive posture,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to play those games.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several people at the meeting praised and supported Sara Hicks, a sophomore who started a petition saying that the walkout was disrespectful and that administrators were wrong not to punish those involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several people at the meeting, including Brown, recommended diversity training for faculty and a more racially diverse curriculum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Students did not have the tolerance to listen and to digest what was really being said,&rdquo; said West Haven resident Curtis Jordan, 71. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Others who spoke at the meeting said West Haven has too few black teachers and administrators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;West Haven is small enough to correct the racial divide,&rdquo; said Cynthia Jennings, a civil rights lawyer and member of the Greater New Haven NAACP. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The meeting ended with the creation of a 22-member committee that will draw up recommendations for diversity training, curriculum and hiring to present to the superintendent of schools and Board of Education. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are African Americans struggling to make a difference in our own community,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need to change things.&rdquo;
