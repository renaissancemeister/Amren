			<h1>
				<a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/8148646.htm">Pair Face Prison for Immigration Bribes</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Larry Lebowitz, herald.com (Miami), Mar. 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A U.S. immigration employee and a Chilean accomplice pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling at least 110 phony work permits to other illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Isidro Guerrero Fernandez, 32, and his twice-deported street recruiter, Miguel Raggio, 50, generated more than $1 million from the scheme, according to investigators with the Department of Homeland Security inspector general. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Guerrero, who was studying to become a Homeland Security special agent at the time of his arrest, is looking at five to seven years in prison based on the plea terms and sentencing guidelines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Raggio, who was deported as recently as 2000 for illegally entering the United States, is looking at four years in prison. U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan set sentencing for June 11. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prosecutor Marie Villafa&ntilde;a said Raggio and a third defendant would recruit illegal immigrants who needed work papers to stay in the country and obtain jobs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Raggio would pick up the bribes, ranging from $5,500 to $6,500, at a fast-food restaurant across from the Immigration and Naturalization Service building. Guerrero would take the clients to the front of the line and produce their photo IDs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the false papers were sold to illegal immigrants from Argentina, the Middle East and Africa, said Homeland Security agents Brian Dennison and Jennifer Duey. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Guerrero and Raggio forfeited cars, cash and luxury goods. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Remaining defendant Vivian Ciarrochi is scheduled to start trial on April 4 &mdash; even though she confessed to agents and wore a wire to help them make a case against Raggio.
