				&ldquo;Five men, full of hate &mdash; and it doesn&rsquo;t matter to my family and extended family what colour these men are &mdash; murdered my eldest son&rdquo; &mdash; Angela Donald, mother of murder victim Kris Donald 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police abandoned a high-level investigation to clamp down on the emergence of an Asian gang culture in Glasgow after the operation was deemed to be politically incorrect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The revelation came as Nick Griffin, the leader of the British National Party, prompted outrage by announcing a visit to Glasgow this weekend, days after a teenager was abducted and murdered, allegedly by a gang of Asian youths. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police and community leaders in the Pollokshields area of Glasgow called for calm, following rising public concern over the kidnap and murder of Kriss Donald, 15. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As detectives continued the hunt for his killers, The Scotsman learned that Operation Gadher, a police investigation designed to tackle the growth of Asian gang culture in the city&rsquo;s southside, was stopped six months ago over fears that it wasn&rsquo;t politically correct. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking yesterday, a police source said the operation, launched by Strathclyde&rsquo;s G Division, which covers Pollokshields, had been halted by senior officers. He said: &ldquo;Gang culture among Asians has been causing the police concern for some time, and we did have a dedicated team looking at it, but six months ago a number of senior officers got cold feet, claiming it didn&rsquo;t look good to be solely investigating Asian gangs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The decision wasn&rsquo;t welcomed in the station.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Detective Superintendent Elliot McKenzie, who is leading the murder investigation, said his inquiry team of more than 60 officers had been overwhelmed by the response from the public. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He added: &ldquo;We have recovered two cars in the Glasgow area that are being examined. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I am delighted with the response from the public. People are genuinely shocked at this crime, and this is reflected in the amount of calls from those anxious to help.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Griffin claimed the trip to Scotland 
			</p>
			<p>
				had been part of the BNP&rsquo;s long-term strategy for the European elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He is also planning to visit Pollokshields tomorrow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, John Swinney, the SNP leader, revealed he had written to the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police, Willie Rae, calling for the police to examine what powers they have to prevent Mr Griffin from visiting the area. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A police spokeswoman said banning the BNP would prove difficult. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t ban someone from visiting a city. However, we are aware of the proposed visit, which is continually being assessed,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Angela Donald, the mother of the murder victim, pleaded with people in the south side of the city to help bring the killers of her son to justice, instead of venting their anger in tit-for-tat racial violence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said: &ldquo;Five men, full of hate &mdash; and it doesn&rsquo;t matter to my family and extended family what colour these men are &mdash; murdered my eldest son. Kriss is gone because of gangs, not just in Pollokshields, but every area of our communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;However, I would urge the public not to target the Asian community because of his death. Kriss&rsquo;s life and short time in our world will be for nothing if those responsible are not caught and punished for the horror they have brought to my family.&rdquo;
