				<a href="http://www.sunherald.com/mld/sunherald/news/state/8223113.htm">Voter ID Bill Fails after Tears Flow</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Geoff Pender, The Sun Herald, Mar. 19 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>JACKSON &mdash; </b>Emotions ran high and tears flowed as House members debated late into Thursday night a voter identification bill that raised ghosts of Mississippi&rsquo;s past. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, a bill that would have required voters to show identification to cast affidavit ballots failed 47-72. Many whites who had been prepared to vote yes changed their minds after hearing testimonials from black members who grew up in a segregated state with Jim Crow laws and practices that intimidated black voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Tonight we have heard the most complete, honest and open floor debate in the last 25 years,&rdquo; said House Speaker Billy McCoy, D-Rienzi. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;An old wound has been opened tonight &mdash; an old wound that has not yet healed &mdash; and an issue that is very emotional on both sides,&rdquo; said Rep. Ed Blackmon, D-Canton, who recounted a story of being locked in a jail during Mississippi&rsquo;s civil rights struggle. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Voter identification has polarized Mississippi lawmakers for years. Some want it, saying it would help curtail voter fraud; others, especially those who remember poll taxes and other measures to keep blacks from voting, say it would intimidate black voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many lawmakers, black and white, left the Capitol Thursday night saying they understood each others&rsquo; view better. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Let us all come together and share in God&rsquo;s grace,&rdquo; said Rep. Billy Broomfield, D-Moss Point.
