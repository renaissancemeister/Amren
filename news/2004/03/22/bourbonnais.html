				Liberal Appointee Faces Fraud Rap
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jim Bronskill, cnews, Mar. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				OTTAWA (CP) &mdash; A federal Liberal appointee is among 11 people facing a raft of criminal charges for allegedly participating in a fraud ring that fixed immigration appeal hearings in exchange for cash. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The RCMP accused Yves Bourbonnais, formerly of the Immigration and Refugee Board, and 10 others Thursday of forming a &ldquo;very well structured criminal organization.&rdquo; &ldquo;The offences committed in the matter strike at the heart of the administration of justice,&rdquo; said Staff Sgt. Sergio Pasin, lead investigator during a three-year probe of the activities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mounties laid a whopping 278 criminal charges &mdash; ranging from fraud to passport forgery &mdash; against Bourbonnais and his alleged accomplices, all of whom are Quebecers not employed by the board. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bourbonnais, a 62-year-old judicial officer with the board in Montreal and Ottawa, was suspended from his duties in 2001, and his term expired last October. He denies any wrongdoing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Ottawa RCMP initiated the probe in the fall of 2000 in response to a complaint from an immigration lawyer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mounties said the investigation revealed that between 50 and 60 people facing hearings were offered positive judgments from the board in exchange for cash bribes of $8,000 to $15,000 per person. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The people allegedly approached for bribes were from the Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern and Italian communities in Montreal and Ottawa, said RCMP Sgt. Jocelyn Mimeault, a force spokesman. &ldquo;Obviously what we&rsquo;re talking about is corruption.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He declined to say whether any rigged hearings actually took place. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mimeault did not rule out further charges, saying the investigation is continuing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Oct. 25, 2001, the RCMP performed searches at various locations, including the board&rsquo;s Montreal offices, private businesses and homes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 200-page affidavit used to obtain a search warrant described an extensive police probe that involved wiretaps, physical surveillance and numerous complaints from newcomers to Canada about alleged pressure for bribes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Immigration and Refugee Board would not comment Thursday on the specific charges, noting the case is now before the courts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll let the justice system run its course,&rdquo; said Dominique Forget, a board spokeswoman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The allegations, while serious, involve &ldquo;one individual and should not overshadow the excellent work of the IRB,&rdquo; she added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This week, Immigration Minister Judy Sgro announced changes to the appointment process for the board, aiming to eliminate political patronage, strengthen the merit criteria and increase parliamentary review of nominees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The changes are to take effect within 90 days.
