			<p>
				Bryon Holman searched Hobby Lobby on East Battlefield Road recently for fabric to make blankets. What he found instead made him livid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Greeting him were statues of monkeys holding serving trays &mdash; sitting on the same shelves as figurines of dark-skinned servants. The figures, the 34-year-old thought, harked to the bygone racist caricatures of African-Americans as ape-like subhumans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Springfield for 12 years, and every day I feel more and more like we&rsquo;re making progress,&rdquo; Holman said. &ldquo;I felt safe and secure that my kids aren&rsquo;t going to be raised in a racist, violent, dangerous environment, and now I&rsquo;m worried that maybe I was wrong.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Manager Jim Hutchison saw it differently: &ldquo;From a retail point of view, that particular style of decoration is extremely popular right now.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The statues are part of what interior designers call an &ldquo;African desert&rdquo; or &ldquo;British colonial&rdquo; motif, which has gained favor with decorators in recent years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a popular brand, but as far as offending anyone, I don&rsquo;t think that ever entered into anybody&rsquo;s thought when they bought them,&rdquo; Hutchison added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The statues&rsquo; racial undertones may lie in the subjective gray area of art between what pleases and what offends. And the difference in interpretation highlights a long-running debate over art some consider racially offensive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s unclear whether the servant statues are portrayals of Africans; stickers say they were made in India, and one African-American studies professor suggested the statues could be depicting dark-skinned Indians. A Hobby Lobby lawyer wouldn&rsquo;t identify the manufacturer of the statues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Springfield interior designer Cindy Love cautions not to read into the images. She calls the suited primate statue &ldquo;just a whimsical way of dressing a monkey.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But that&rsquo;s what riles Holman and others. When people accent their homes with &ldquo;cute&rdquo; statues without knowing what they may depict or resemble, it&rsquo;s disturbing, says Kenneth Goings, chair of the African-American and African Studies Department at Ohio State University. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They&rsquo;re less aware of the kind of hurt and pain that these images and these kinds of objects brought to an older generation of African-Americans,&rdquo; Goings said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the 1800s, blacks have been caricatured in images ranging from Aunt Jemima to Little Black Sambo to lawn jockeys. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Blacks were also portrayed as apes and gorillas to dehumanize them, Goings said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The two statues Holman saw probably originated in the late 1800s, maybe as late as 1930, said Goings, who wrote &ldquo;Mammy and Uncle Mose: Black Collectibles and American Stereotyping.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Goings, who viewed the statues in an e-mailed photograph, said the servant statue looks very close to traditionally black lawn jockeys. And the other statue appears to &ldquo;invoke an African-American,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many humanlike qualities to the face,&rdquo; he said, adding that such statue caricatures show an &ldquo;intelligent monkey&rdquo; that&rsquo;s &ldquo;happy to be working for the master.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				These largely faded from American culture after the 1950s, Goings said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based company with about 315 stores nationwide, has no plans to phase out any of the statues, company officials said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hobby Lobby will continue selling the servants because the store has similar statues of all complexions, said Ruby Race, executive assistant to company CEO David Green. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And Green said the monkey statues will remain. &ldquo;We will not stop selling monkeys. We don&rsquo;t see that as something that should be offensive.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, regarding the tall, suited chimp statue, Southwest Missouri State University philosophy professor Johnny Washington said in an e-mail : &ldquo;Clearly an image such as the one under discussion seems to be intended to project African-Americans in a dehumanizing light.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But others may just be reading too much into the statues, said Larry Maddox, president of Springfield&rsquo;s NAACP chapter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You know what I see in that?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A monkey in a tux.&rdquo;
