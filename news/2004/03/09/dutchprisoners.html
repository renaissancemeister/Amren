			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>expatica.com, Mar. 8</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				AMSTERDAM &mdash; Startling figures on Monday indicated that 55 percent of detainees in Dutch prisons last year were not born in the Netherlands, a rise of 5 percent compared with 1995. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said 9 percent of detainees were born in Suriname, about 9 percent came from the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, 7 percent were Moroccans and 5 percent were Turkish, newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Dutch media and politicians have repeatedly expressed concerns about &ldquo;ethnic crime&rdquo; in the Netherlands and authorities in cities such as Rotterdam and Amsterdam have highlighted street crime problems allegedly committed by migrant youth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several brutal crimes committed and also allegedly committed by immigrants in recent years have also heightened concerns, while figures have revealed that a majority of murders involve ethnic minorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But ethnic groups claim they are being stigmatised, while the jobless rate and socio-economic position of migrant communities is traditionally worse than that of native Dutch. The Social and Cultural Planning Bureau (SCP) said in December that non-western migrants were the main victims of declining prosperity in the Netherlands. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, the CBS also said that the total number of prisoners increased to almost 14,000 on 1 September 2003, a rise of 7 percent compared with the year before. There were about 13,000 men in jail last year, while the number of female detainees (840) remained stable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of people serving long sentences increased by 13 percent. There are almost 1,600 people serving a sentence of four years or more. Just 4 percent of these people are women and just 20 people are serving life sentences, all of whom are men.
