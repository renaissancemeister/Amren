				100 Vie for Numero Uno in Spanish Spelling Bee
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Yvonne Wingett, Arizona Republic, Mar. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				For Samantha Arroyos, Roosevelt School District&rsquo;s Spanish spelling bee all came down to freedom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>L &mdash; i &mdash; b &mdash; e &mdash; r &mdash; t &mdash; a &mdash; d</i>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The pigtailed, 8-year-old third-grader from Ignacio G. Conchos Elementary School correctly spelled the Spanish word, meaning freedom, beating out 30 other second &mdash; and third-graders who were also painstakingly vying for the top-speller rank at the <i>Torneo de ortograf&iacute;a</i> on Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the Arroyos family, which came to south Phoenix three years ago from Juarez, Mexico, not knowing a word of English, capturing second place in the primary-level competition meant more than being a good speller. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It represented the beginning of an education that eventually will land Samantha career opportunities that she wouldn&rsquo;t have had in Mexico. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;<i>Estoy orgulloso,</i> I am proud,&rdquo; said mother Neida Arroyos, who watched the spelling bee. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always accomplishing her goals, and this was one of her goals. For us, it&rsquo;s an achievement, not only for her but for her teacher.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Spanish Spelling Bee has become a tradition at Roosevelt, where an estimated 80 percent of the district&rsquo;s elementary and middle school students are Latino. Fifty percent of the district&rsquo;s 12,000 students are English-learners, or monolingual Spanish speakers, administrators said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although other school districts in the Valley, such as Tempe, hold Spanish bees, Roosevelt has come under some fire by state officials for its use of Spanish in the classroom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think the activities need to be chosen more wisely,&rdquo; said Margaret Garcia-Dugan, associate superintendent for the Arizona Department of Education. &ldquo;If children do not speak English, that is what they should be teaching them if they are monolingual students.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				District officials say the method is essential given the students and population they serve. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 100 second &mdash; through eighth-graders participated in the event, with six girls outspelling all of the boys. Mareli Aguilera, 8, a third-grader at Ed &amp; Verma Pastor Elementary, won first place in the primary level; Vania Rodriguez, 10, a fourth-grader at Sunland Elementary School, spelled her way to <i>numero uno </i>at the intermediate level; and Irlanda Espriella, an eighth-grader at Percy L. Julian School, won the first-place position at the junior-high level. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I studied for an hour every day after school and also during school,&rdquo; said Rodriguez, of south Phoenix. &ldquo;I can spell words in both languages.&rdquo;
