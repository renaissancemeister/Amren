				The EOIR&rsquo;s Other Directive &mdash; White Males Need Not Apply
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Juan Mann, VDare.com, Mar. 9</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 1995 civil rights class action lawsuit on behalf of white males against the Executive Office for Immigration Review <b>(</b><b>EOIR</b><b>)</b> and its Chief Immigration Judge <a href="https://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/fs/ocijbio.htm"><b>Michael J. Creppy</b></a> has been settled for an undisclosed sum of taxpayer dollars, potentially in the millions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An announcement that <b>&ldquo;the parties have reached an agreement in principle on a monetary settlement of this claim&rdquo;</b> appeared recently on the <a href="https://www.katorparks.com/"><b>web site</b></a> of the plaintiff&rsquo;s <b>law firm.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The suit alleges that Creppy &mdash; an employee of the U.S. Department of Justice who is black &mdash; systematically discriminated against over 150 white male applicants in the appointment of EOIR immigration judges nationwide. The suit was filed in 1995 on behalf of <b>&ldquo;white male applicants for employment not selected as Immigration Judges during 1994 and 1995.&rdquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Having made headlines shortly after September 11, 2001, as author of the <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/5/27/121930.shtml">&ldquo;<b>Creppy directive,&rdquo;</b></a> the Chief Immigration Judge gained notoriety as a nemesis of the Treason Lobby for closing the Immigration Court removal hearings of terrorism suspects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But ironically, Creppy&rsquo;s public flogging by the Treason Lobby came to pass in spite of Creppy&rsquo;s years of hiring an alien-friendly <a href="https://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/sibpages/ICadr.htm">assortment</a> of immigration judges, and apparently following another <b>&ldquo;Creppy directive,&rdquo;</b> that is &mdash; <i>white males</i><i> need not apply.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The discrimination case against Creppy was filed before the U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission <b>(</b><a href="https://www.adversity.net/c3_tbd.htm"><b>EEOC</b></a><b>)</b> in Washington, D.C. The class action complainant, Lawrence D. Durnford is represented by attorney Mike Milligan of El Paso, Texas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Durnford originally brought suit against Attorney General John Ashcroft because Creppy works as an agent of the U.S. Department of Justice. Because of the <b>conduct</b> of Creppy and his henchmen at the EOIR, the settlement of the suit could cost the taxpayers millions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With the Department of Justice settlement now in the works, it&rsquo;s high time for all the EOIR bureaucrats responsible for this travesty to be fired! 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s also time for the Attorney General to investigate Creppy&rsquo;s own conduct surrounding the entire <a href="https://www.adversity.net/fed_stats/OPM2003/opm2003_StartFrame.htm">employment discrimination</a> claim . . . and to <b>clean house</b> at the EOIR starting at the top. As a holdover from the Clinton Administration, Creppy&rsquo;s time at the EOIR has come and gone long ago. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As I&rsquo;ve already w<b>ritten</b> at length, for a <b>multitude</b> of policy reasons, the entire <b>EOIR</b> system deserves to be <b>abolished</b><b>.</b> But now the admitted liability for employment discrimination &mdash; as well as the veil of mystery surrounding this most obscure of all Justice Department agencies &mdash; screams out that the EOIR desperately needs new management. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Please get well soon, Mr. Ashcroft!
