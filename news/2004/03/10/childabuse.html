			<h1>
				Boynton Couple Accused of Tying Up Toddler so They Could Go Dancing
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Nancy L. Oth&oacute;n, sunsentinel.com (FL), Mar. 9</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Boynton Beach man and his girlfriend were arrested over the weekend after the man tied up his girlfriend&rsquo;s 1-year-old daughter with bed sheets so the couple could go out dancing, police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Oscar Sanchez-Lucas, 24, and Carolina Pineda, 25, were each charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse and child neglect late Saturday night. Both remained in the Palm Beach County Jail on Monday evening. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 1-year-old girl was crying hysterically, her arms and legs tied behind her with a sheet, when relatives who heard her cries at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday found the child in a bedroom at the family&rsquo;s home on Northwest First Avenue, police said. The bed sheet also was tied around her neck, according to arrest reports. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sanchez-Lucas was in the car waiting for Pineda, who was in the bathroom getting ready to go out, police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boynton Beach police Sgt. Gary Chapman said he was stunned upon hearing of the incident. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;First, there was disbelief that anyone could do that to a child &mdash; to anyone, but especially to a child,&rdquo; Chapman said. &ldquo;Secondly, it&rsquo;s just nauseating.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sanchez-Lucas and Pineda were charged with aggravated child abuse for &ldquo;willfully torturing&rdquo; the girl by tying her up, according to arrest reports. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They were also charged with child neglect &ldquo;for failure to make any reasonable effort to protect the children from abuse,&rdquo; the police report said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The couple also faces an additional child-abuse count because Pineda hit her 3-year-old son in the back with a belt earlier that night, police said. Both were charged because they &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo; punished the boy, the arrest report said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police who interviewed the 3-year-old said the boy began to cry when his shirt was lifted. Officers noted a red mark, the width of a belt, on the boy&rsquo;s back along with other bruises, according to arrest reports. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When police interviewed the children&rsquo;s older sibling, he told them that Pineda and Sanchez-Lucas hit his brother and sister &ldquo;constantly when they misbehave,&rdquo; according to arrest reports. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also told police the girl had been tied up a few months ago when the couple went out for the evening. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy said that on Saturday, Pineda did nothing to stop what happened to his sister, the arrest report said. However, a family member at the home Monday afternoon said Sanchez-Lucas should be the only one facing charges because Pineda was unaware that her daughter had been tied up. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Ramos, Pineda&rsquo;s sister-in-law. &ldquo;She was in the bathroom.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sanchez-Lucas tied up the girl because she wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep and it was time for the couple to go out to a disco, Ramos said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chapman said the investigation into the case is continuing. The children are in custody of their grandmother.
