				New Immigration Plan &lsquo;Only in ANC&rsquo;s Interest&rsquo;
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Mail and Guardian Online (South Africa), Mar. 9</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Democratic Alliance has criticised apparent government plans to do away with visa requirements for about 2,9-billion people, mainly from poorer countries around the world. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This opens up the serious prospect of millions of people flooding into South Africa to compete for jobs and social grants,&rdquo; DA chief election spokesperson Douglas Gibson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Constitutional Court ruled last week that social welfare grants could no longer be limited to South African citizens only. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Exempting 2,9-billion people from visa requirements &mdash; from most African countries, as well as China, Russia and India &mdash; is an open invitation to them to come to South Africa for the chance of a better life, Gibson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was responding to a report in <i>ThisDay</i> newspaper on Tuesday, which said Cabinet wants the visa exemptions included in the new immigration regulations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a statement on Tuesday, Gibson said what the regulations should be doing is inviting people to come to South African to help provide a better life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What is in it for South Africa? The African National Congress seems to be putting ideological and party-political considerations ahead of South Africa&rsquo;s best interests.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The original intention of the Immigration Act and the regulations was to serve South Africa&rsquo;s interests by attracting desperately needed skills and tourist dollars to the country, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But instead, the ANC has chosen to offer universal visa exemptions to countries with which it has close historical ties.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				South Africa is desperately short of skilled professionals in a number of sectors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi set out to solve this problem by liberalising immigration laws and regulations, and encouraging those with something to offer South Africa to come here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Minister Buthelezi has been acting in the best interests of the country. The ANC, by contrast, acts only in the interests of the ANC,&rdquo; Gibson said.
