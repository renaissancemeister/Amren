			<h1>
				Bush Ad Offends Some Arabs
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Gregg Krupa, Detroit News, Mar. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Dearborn </b> &mdash;  Prominent Arab-Americans and local Democrats called on the Bush-Cheney '04 campaign to pull a television advertisement that shows the face of a young Middle Eastern man, saying the ad is offensive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They are trying to use stereotypes to defame a community,&rdquo; said lawyer Nabih Ayad. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arab critics of the television spot said the president&rsquo;s campaign for re-election would not have spurred controversy if it had broadcast a picture of Osama bin Laden or other recognizable terrorists, rather than the anonymous Middle Eastern man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I would not mind if they were to use a true image of terrorism, like a known terrorist,&rdquo; said Imad Hamad, director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. &ldquo;But to use just a typical ordinary face of a Middle Easterner or a person of Arab descent is very serious and plays into the idea that Americans should be afraid of Arabs and Arab-Americans in general.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Responding to the criticism, the Bush-Cheney campaign issued a statement: &ldquo;We think that the ad fairly depicts the challenges and threats our country is facing in these times.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The new 30-second advertisement is called &ldquo;100 Days.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s playing nationally in select markets, including Metro Detroit, and is also featured on the Bush-Cheney campaign Web site. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An announcer says that Democrat John Kerry would &ldquo;weaken the Patriot Act used to arrest terrorists and defend Americans.&rdquo; As the audio plays, an image of a dark-skinned, dark-eyed young man appears on the screen, along with images of a traveler looking at an airport schedule and a person wearing a gas mask. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is creating a negative stereotype of a young, unidentified, but clearly Middle Eastern male,&rdquo; said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in Washington. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have boys who look like that,&rdquo; Zogby said about his sons. &ldquo;I have cousins who are in the American military fighting in Iraq who look like that.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Michigan Democratic Party issued a statement saying the advertisement offended the Arab-American community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to pit one group against another,&rdquo; said party Chairman Melvin &ldquo;Butch&rdquo; Hollowell. &ldquo;And disparaging loyal American citizens in this way, he should be ashamed of himself.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Azzam Elder, Wayne County corporation counsel, said the image hurts people who &ldquo;have felt the sting from stereotyping.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When you are the president of the United States,&rdquo; Elder said, &ldquo;every word you utter resonates around the world.&rdquo;
