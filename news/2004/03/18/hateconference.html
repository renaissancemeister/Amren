				Scholars Gather for Wash. Hate Conference
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Nicholas K. Geranios, AP, Mar. 17 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) &mdash; Scholars who want to know why people hate are gathering at Gonzaga University in hopes of shaping a new academic discipline to study a prime motivator of people&rsquo;s behavior. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Hatred is the most destructive aspect of human history,&rdquo; said Ken Stern, an organizer of the conference and the American Jewish Committee&rsquo;s expert on anti-Semitism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hate is not a new problem nor is it confined to one region, he said. And too little is known about why people are disposed to hate others. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It impacts all aspects of our lives, and is not just a matter of a hate group here, a discriminatory practice there,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The three-day conference, which began Thursday, is sponsored by the Gonzaga Institute for Action Against Hate and will feature tolerance groups, legal experts and others. Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees will be a closing night speaker. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No members of hate groups are scheduled to speak nor have such groups registered for the conference, said Jerri Shepard, director of the Gonzaga institute. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Northwest has become known in recent decades as a place where some hate groups feel comfortable to operate, and Shepard said that makes it a good place for the conference. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more out in the open here than in a lot of other places,&rdquo; Shepard said. The existence of hate groups locally has also spurred people to work to oppose them, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Gonzaga Institute for Action Against Hate publishes the &ldquo;Journal of Hate Studies.&rdquo; The institute was founded in 1997 after black law students were targets of racist and sometimes threatening mail and phone calls.
