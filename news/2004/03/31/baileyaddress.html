			<h1>
				Support for Bailey Wanes on Residency
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				It&rsquo;s embarrassing, John Daley says 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>John McCormick, Chicago Tribune, Mar. 31</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A key political patron of state Rep. Patricia Bailey on Tuesday expressed dismay over questions about her residency and allegations of potential election-law violations as he suggested support may be waning for the South Side lawmaker among her fellow Democrats. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She has to address this herself, to the voters of her district and the people who elect her,&rdquo; said John Daley, a Cook County commissioner and leader of the 11th Ward Democratic organization. &ldquo;It is embarrassing.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chicago election officials said Monday that the freshman legislator does not appear to live in the South Side district she represents and may have broken the law by misrepresenting her residency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They forwarded the case to county prosecutors for a potential felony-level investigation, as well as to the Illinois House, which has the authority to expel Bailey. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cook County State&rsquo;s Atty. Richard Devine might refer the case to Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan because of a potential conflict of interest. Bailey&rsquo;s mother is a longtime employee of Devine&rsquo;s office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&ldquo;We hope to have our review completed and a decision made within the next several days,&rdquo; said Jerry Lawrence, a spokesman for Devine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bailey declined to answer any questions about her residency Tuesday. Her driver&rsquo;s license remains listed to an address on South Hermitage Avenue, outside the 6th House District she represents. In October, she also used that address on a voter-registration application. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Tuesday, election officials said they discovered a newer voter registration record for Bailey that shows she registered to vote earlier this month at a different South Side address, shortly after the Tribune asked her questions about her residency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The address provided for the new voter registration is a duplex on West Garfield Boulevard that on Tuesday had a &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign and a real-estate agent&rsquo;s lock box on the door. Neighbors said no one has lived in the lower unit for months and a young couple lives in the upper unit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Election officials said Bailey would not have had to provide any documentation to transfer her voter registration from one address to another. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A representative of the real-estate firm that listed Bailey&rsquo;s latest address said someone entered into a contract to buy the property on March 9, about a week before the primary election, which Bailey won over two rivals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While saying he was embarrassed by the Bailey matter, Daley stopped short of declaring he would withhold future political support for her or ask her to resign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think some of the committeemen might be looking at this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that this has occurred.&rdquo; 
			</p>
