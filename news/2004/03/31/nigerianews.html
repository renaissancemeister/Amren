			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>news24.com, Mar. 31</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Abuja &mdash; The Nigerian government Tuesday banned local broadcast media from live transmission of news broadcasts from foreign stations, a practice described by officials as a &ldquo;professional aberration&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The head of the nation&rsquo;s state-run broadcast regulatory agency, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), Sila Yisa, announced the ban during a news conference. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In keeping with the mandate of monitoring the Nigerian airwaves, the NBC has put a stop to the relay of news and news magazine broadcasts from foreign stations by Nigerian terrestrial stations,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ban, which becomes effective from April 1, became necessary because it was &ldquo;a professional aberration&rdquo; for a local station to relay live any news item that it had no control over, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Such live broadcasts also pose a danger to Nigeria&rsquo;s national interests, he said, without giving details. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Any terrestrial broadcast station in Nigeria that conducts a live relay of news or news programmes of a foreign station will be sanctioned according to the prescription of the NBC code,&rdquo; Yisa said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The NBC approves, renews and withdraws broadcasts licences in Nigeria. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Foreign news and related programmes would only be allowed to be broadcast on local radio and television stations after the scripts were re-written and voiced locally, he also said.
