				&lsquo;Traditional Medicine Helps with Aids&rsquo;
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Mail and Guardian, Mar. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A senior World Health Organisation (WHO) official told a conference on Tuesday that traditional medicine had helped improve the condition of two of his nieces, who are HIV-positive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr Welile Shasha, the WHO liaison officer in South Africa, said he took the two to a traditional healer and their conditions improved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They are being tested for viral load &hellip; to see where they are,&rdquo; he told a conference of traditional leaders in Benoni. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Shasha said HIV-positive people should be exposed to decent choices as contained in the comprehensive treatment plan for HIV/Aids. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking at the conference earlier, Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said the status and profile of traditional healers should be raised for the benefit of all South Africans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is unfortunate that we often lose sight of the continuing service that has been offered by this sector, which remains largely informal and marginalised in most parts of the world,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tshabalala-Msimang said she believed that traditional medicine could not be adapted to Western medicine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We believe that traditional medicine is a discipline on its own,&rdquo; she said, adding that traditional and Western medicine should work hand in hand. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We cannot ignore their immense contribution in the provision of health care over [the] centuries.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The theme of the conference is <i>Working Together with Traditional Health Practitioners in Health Care Delivery</i>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These health practitioners are the first health care providers to be consulted in up to 80% of cases, especially in rural areas,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is for this reason that there has been a recognition of traditional medicine practice in South Africa.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are about 200 000 traditional healers in South Africa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More than 150 people attended the conference. In 2000 the WHO said about 80% of the people in Africa relied on traditional healers. &mdash; Sapa
