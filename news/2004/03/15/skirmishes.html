			<h1>
				<a href="https://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37563">Americans in Gun Sights of Mexican Army</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jon Dougherty, WorldNetDaily.com, Mar. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				You&rsquo;d think frequent gun battles along the U.S.-Mexico border between federal agents and citizen border-monitoring groups on this side, and drug and people smugglers on the other side, would make the national headlines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you thought that, you&rsquo;d be mistaken. Just ask Chris Simcox, owner of the Tombstone (Ariz.) Tumbleweed newspaper, and head of one such border group. He&rsquo;s trying to get the word out; few are listening and, apparently, that includes anyone in Washington. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In an e-mail to select correspondents last month, Simcox said there was &ldquo;another&rdquo; shootout very similar to others that have occurred with increasingly frequency along remote areas of the Arizona border &mdash; areas known to be frequented by drug and alien smugglers and elements of Mexican &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; (which often has included federal troops and police) that escort them to the border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Details are basically the same; shots fired, assailants get away, drugs seized,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;The [Mexican] soldiers we captured on tape have been seen laying down suppression fire during the drug dealers&rsquo; dash back across the border &mdash; this is not hyperbole &mdash; our guys are being fired upon from the other side of the border and they will not return fire. &hellip;&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A high-speed car chase ended with Bisbee police, Border Patrol agents and a detail of the United States Marines coming under automatic weapons fire near the U.S./Mexico border two miles west of Naco, Ariz., on Tuesday morning, Feb. 16,&rdquo; reported Simcox. &ldquo;Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Susan Herskovits confirmed on Wednesday that the agency is involved in the investigation, because it involves an assault on federal law-enforcement agents and involves gunfire from across the international boundary with Mexico.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Feb. 19, says Simcox, &ldquo;we had yet another incident involving automatic gunfire directed at our [law-enforcement] agents.&rdquo; While he says he wasn&rsquo;t close enough to confirm, it appeared that, at a distance, the law-enforcement &ldquo;vehicles were full of bullet holes.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While none of these most recent gun battles has produced any casualties, that&rsquo;s not to say U.S. citizens and federal agents tasked with guarding our borders haven&rsquo;t been hurt or killed in this escalating border war. In 2002, U.S. Park Service Ranger Kris Eggle (pronounced egg-lee) was killed in a drug-related shooting (the perp used an AK-47). Other agents have been wounded, and American citizens captured or threatened. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In my book, <a href="https://www.shopnetdaily.com/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1495">Illegals: The Imminent Threat Posed by Our Unsecured U.S.-Mexico Border</a>,&rdquo; I document this longstanding problem that has been occurring with more frequency in the past few years. There is even photographic evidence that armed Mexican troops regularly patrol within feet of the U.S. border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book contains documentation from eyewitnesses who said they&rsquo;ve seen Mexican military and paramilitary police assisting Mexican nationals with crossing illegally into the U.S. And witnesses have described how some Mexican army and federal police units actually provide armed cover for smugglers packing drugs into our country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I describe how, back in 1985, an American father and his daughter were briefly held at gunpoint <i>inside the United States</i> and on their own property by a gun-toting squad of Mexican soldiers &mdash; who were eventually let go by U.S. government officials <i>with their weapons.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A few other news agencies have reported some incidents of gunfire along the border, but almost always details are lacking, hard questions are never asked (or answered) and the incursions are usually dismissed as &ldquo;accidental border crossings&rdquo; by American and Mexican authorities. Consequently, the issue hasn&rsquo;t caught on nationally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But why? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Because few in the national media want to discuss it. Even fewer politicians do. And almost no one in Washington wants to admit the fact that our already porous borders are spiraling further out of control &mdash; perhaps irretrievably so. Hispanic voters and cheaper labor is more important than the lives of American citizens and law-enforcement personnel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Americans are facing another election cycle. Much of the banter thus far has centered around &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; issues &mdash; taxes, jobs, the economy, ad nauseum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But perhaps for the first time since the Cold War, national security is also an issue, thanks to 9-11. That&rsquo;s where our borders problem fits in; it simply is not a good thing for security when porous borders are ignored. Still, the major candidates for office largely ignore this vital issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyone who assumes the Wild West faded into the sunset a hundred years ago hasn&rsquo;t spent much time along the border. Then again, that&rsquo;s probably a good thing; you might live longer.
