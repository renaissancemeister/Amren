			<h1>
				Sikh Turban Theft Story Was Fabricated, Police Say
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>AP, Sun-Sentinel (FL), Mar. 11</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				LODI, N.J. &mdash; Two Sikh teenagers who told police they were attacked by five men who yanked off their turbans and cut off their hair apparently fabricated the story, police said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lodi Police Chief Vincent J. Caruso said Wednesday that the pair &mdash; 18-year-old Simrandeep Singh and a 17-year-old &mdash; made a false bias claim to police on March 3 to conceal the fact that they had cut their own hair, in violation of their religion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Caruso said the two could face charges. As of Wednesday night, none had been filed.
			</p>
			<p>
				He said Lodi police continued to investigate after finding holes in the teens&rsquo; original report, and that the teens eventually cooperated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Singh and the 17-year-old told police they were at a bus stop when a group of men approached them and asked to borrow money. The groups got into a pushing match, and the groups wound up in Memorial Park, Capt. Vincent Quatrone has said.
			</p>
			<p>
				There, the teens told police they were kicked and punched and robbed of about $40.
			</p>
			<p>
				One man was then reported to have removed the teens&rsquo; turbans, pulled out a pair of scissors and cut 3 to 4 feet of hair from the victims as they pleaded with him to stop.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sikhs are forbidden by their religion to cut their hair, believing it is a gift from God.
