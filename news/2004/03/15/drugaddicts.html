				<a href="http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=293362004">Plan to Give Drug Addicts Contraceptives</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Murdo Macleod, Scotland on Sunday, Mar. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				FEMALE drug addicts will be given long-term contraceptives under plans being considered by ministers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Scottish Executive has said it is examining plans which were drawn up last year which would see drug users given long-lasting contraceptives, such as injections and coils in order to prevent them having unwanted pregnancies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The admission, comes in the wake of dramatic proposals by a leading academic which would see women on drugs paid to go on contraceptives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But a spokesman for the Executive said ministers did not envisage paying addicts not to have children, and no-one would be forced to have contraception. He explained that the Hidden Harm report, which was published last June, suggested long-term contraception for drug addicts as one of a number of recommendations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neil McKeganey, professor of drug misuse research at Glasgow University, said paying women addicts to take contraception would slash the number of unwanted pregnancies among drug abusers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the move would help tackle the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; of neglect experienced by tens of thousands of children with drug addict parents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McKeganey&rsquo;s research showed some children were not being fed or clothed properly. He said a few had woken up to find their parents had died from an overdose. His research also suggested that more than 60% of addict mothers and 85% of addict fathers no longer looked after their children. Many of these children were instead being looked after by grandparents or the local authority. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McKeganey said: &ldquo;[The] situation is so far beyond our capacity that we need to look at ways of reducing the likelihood of female drug users becoming pregnant.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But a spokesman for the Catholic Church, Peter Kearney, said: &ldquo;If you are going to sterilise drug-addicted women, why stop there? Why not sterilise alcoholics? There must be as many women with chronic alcohol problems.&rdquo;
