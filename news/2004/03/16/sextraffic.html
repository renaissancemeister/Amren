				Lawmaker Wants Feds to Stop Deportation of Woman Implicated in Man&rsquo;s Murder

				Southland Lawmaker Says Woman Is Victim of Alleged Abuse, Rape, Torture 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>NBC-4, Mar. 15 (Southern CA)</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LOS ANGELES &mdash; A Southland lawmaker Monday called on federal authorities to stop the deportation of a woman implicated in the murder of a man later found to have repeatedly raped her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rep. Hilda L. Solis, D-El Monte, says Maria Suarez is a victim of abuse, rape and torture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The United States is a beacon of light around the world because of its commitment to human rights,&rdquo; Solis said at a news conference today in East Los Angeles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our government should honor this commitment by recognizing the extreme sexual abuse and violence suffered by Maria Suarez in this country and allow her to stay here with her family,&rdquo; Solis said. &ldquo;This is a clear humanitarian case that deserves justice.&rdquo; Solis said Suarez, 43, was a child sex trafficking victim. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two weeks after entering the country legally from Mexico when she was 16, Suarez was lured from her home by an unknown woman and sold for $200 as a sex slave to 68-year-old Anselmo Covarrubias, who beat and raped her, Solis said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Covarrubias held Suarez captive for five years, during which time he raped, battered and tortured her, Solis said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When neighbor Rene Soto killed the then-73-year-old Covarrubias in 1981 with a table leg, Suarez hid the weapon. She was later convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After 22 years in prison, Suarez was released in December from the California Institution for Women in Chino. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger agreed to parole her, based on the recommendation by the Board of Prison Terms, which determined Suarez was a victim of extreme violence, abuse and torture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Schwarzenegger denied Suarez a pardon, despite pleas from Solis and other California lawmakers who claimed the woman was deprived of a viable defense, since battered-woman syndrome was not considered valid at that time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Suarez is now in a prison in San Pedro, awaiting a deportation hearing April 23. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She is a permanent legal resident, but not a U.S. citizen, and immigration law says that, with an aggravated felony on her record, she is to be deported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Suarez&rsquo;s attorney, Jessica Dominguez, said the woman would be in danger if she is deported to Mexico, where those who are aware that she had something to do with the death of a &ldquo;witch doctor&rdquo; would cause her harm.
