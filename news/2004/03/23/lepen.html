				Le Pen Remains Thorn in Side for France&rsquo;s Chirac
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Mark John, Reuters, SignOnSanDiego, Mar. 22</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PARIS &mdash; Two years after France&rsquo;s veteran anti-immigrant campaigner Jean-Marie Le Pen stole the glory in presidential elections, his National Front have pulled off a new coup with fresh gains in regional elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Benefiting from voter anger over high unemployment, painful economic reforms and resurgent fears over terrorism, the National Front grabbed 16 percent of the nationwide vote in Sunday&rsquo;s first round to secure one of its best election scores. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Analysts said the success showed President Jacques Chirac&rsquo;s bid to wipe the National Front off the political map with policies aimed at luring its voters Back to the mainstream &mdash; such as a tough law and order drive &mdash; had so far failed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This proves the National Front&rsquo;s ability to be a thorn in the side of both mainstream left and right &mdash; and particularly the right,&rdquo; said Nonna Mayer, an expert on the far-right at political institute Cevipof. 
			</p>
			<p>
				First-round voting Sunday gave 40 percent of the vote to resurgent left-wing parties, well ahead of the 34 percent score of the mainstream right. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mayer said the National Front appeared to have capitalized on all the same issues as it did in 2002 &mdash; mostly working class resentment of Paris&rsquo;s haughty political elite and discontent over France&rsquo;s high unemployment stuck just under 10 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Added to that was anger at the government&rsquo;s drive to reduce welfare state spending, fears over the European Union&rsquo;s imminent enlargement eastwards and concerns over terrorism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That terrorist threat has tended to stoke anti-Muslim sentiment,&rdquo; said Stephane Rozes at polling institute CSA, cautioning that the effect from that was probably slight. 
			</p>
			<p>
				LE PEN AS CHEERLEADER 
			</p>
			<p>
				The National Front&rsquo;s success is nowhere near on the same scale as Le Pen&rsquo;s triumph in 2002, when he won around 18 percent of the vote in the presidential vote to finish runner-up to Chirac in a result which sent shockwaves through Europe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But it is an improvement on the 15 percent of the vote it won in the 1998 regional elections. In regions like Picardie in the north and the Provence-Alpes-Cote d&rsquo;Azur (PACA) region in the south, it even notched up scores of up to 25 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It also demonstrated that the party can perform without its 75-year-old leader as candidate. Le Pen was barred from standing in the region of his choice on a technicality and so spent the campaign touring the country as the party&rsquo;s main cheerleader. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That they managed to achieve this score without Le Pen as a candidate is a surprise,&rdquo; said Jean-Marc Lech of pollster Ipsos. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as Le Pen never stood any chance of becoming president in 2002, so the National Front stands little chance of gaining control of one of France&rsquo;s 26 regional councils next week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But by qualifying to field candidates for next Sunday&rsquo;s run-offs in 17 regions, it is seen accentuating the scale of the government&rsquo;s defeat by splitting France&rsquo;s right-wing vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That in turn could smooth the way for opposition Socialists to win back a majority of regional councils that set policy from local roadbuilding to tourism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A vote for the National Front is a vote for the left,&rdquo; warned government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope, who came second to the Socialist candidate in the Ile-de-France region around Paris after Le Pen&rsquo;s daughter Marine scored 13 percent.
