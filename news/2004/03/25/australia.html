				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3550241.stm">Australia&rsquo;s Unease with Outsiders</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Australia&rsquo;s population has more than doubled in the last 50 years, and the march towards a multicultural future appears unstoppable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Phil Mercer, BBC, Mar. 24 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Around a quarter of all Australians were born somewhere else. The British make up the biggest group of migrants along with those from Asia, followed by New Zealand and Italy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Melbourne is one of the world&rsquo;s biggest Greek cities, while the tropical outpost of Darwin is one of Australia&rsquo;s most cosmopolitan. Immigration has given Perth, the remote capital of Western Australia, a distinctly English and South African flavour. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But for a country shaped by waves of migrants, much of Australia shares an uncertainty and even a fear about outsiders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Protecting paradise&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Perth, there&rsquo;s a family from the north of England who may help explain this uneasiness. They have everything they&rsquo;d ever wanted: a big house and a successful business. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are three pictures on the living room wall. Queen Elizabeth is flanked on one side by the legendary footballer George Best. On the other is a portrait of Pauline Hanson, the co-founder of the anti-immigration One Nation party, who in the late 1990s warned that Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a seemingly incompatible situation of a migrant family from England supporting a controversial anti-immigration politician. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their reasons are simple enough &mdash; if unpalatable for many people. Here they are away from the gloom and the cold and they don&rsquo;t want anything or anyone to come in and spoil what they see as their slice of paradise. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They want the drawbridge raised &mdash; and the door firmly locked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As the father explained, they had left Britain to &ldquo;escape the blacks&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t want to have to move again. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Such attitudes are not uncommon here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Fierce competition </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government is committed to a multicultural Australia. Immigration is carefully managed and is non-discriminatory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The policies work in similar ways to any big corporation &mdash; Australia recruits people it needs through skilled migration programmes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Competition can be fierce and many more people are rejected than accepted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It wasn&rsquo;t always like this. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 1820s Australia, a convict colony, was competing for new migrants with other New World countries, notably the United States and Canada. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Incentives, such as free travel and land grants, were introduced. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 1920s and 1930s the Empire Settlement Scheme saw thousands of &ldquo;Ten Pound Poms&rdquo; arrive from Britain. It was one of the largest organised migrations ever seen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Family reunions are the other major part of an immigration policy, which allows more than 100,000 settlers to come to Australia every year, along with 12,000 refugees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Election issue </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government continues to weather a storm of criticism over its treatment of asylum seekers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Any unauthorised arrivals &mdash; such as boat people travelling from Indonesia &mdash; are locked away until their claims are processed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mandatory detention is defended on the grounds of health and security. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If the results of the last federal election in 2001 are any indication, the majority of Australians support this uncompromising stance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Border protection is likely to be in the frontline of this year&rsquo;s federal election. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Migration has always been a sensitive issue here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The controversial and racist &ldquo;White Australia&rdquo; policy was finally abandoned in the early 1970s. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For generations, this discriminatory migration programme attempted to sustain the country&rsquo;s European origins in the face of a perceived threat of a mass influx from Asia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration will cause Australia problems in the years ahead, including more pressure on race relations and overcrowding in the bigger cities, especially Sydney. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;ll also present great opportunities as the country pursues a modern, multicultural future.
