			<h1>
				Asian Americans Vie for Contracts
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Francine Knowles, Chic. Sun-Times, Mar. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asian Americans fearful of being excluded from the city&rsquo;s construction set-aside program called on Mayor Daley to support their continued inclusion as a two-day hearing on a court-ordered revamp of the program kicked off Tuesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to say, don&rsquo;t set aside Asian Americans,&rdquo; said Tuyet Le, executive director of the Asian American Institute. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Judge James B. Moran ruled in December that the city&rsquo;s program, which requires the awarding of 25 percent of construction contracts to minorities and 5 percent to women, must be revamped because it&rsquo;s too broad. The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Builders Association of Greater Chicago, which sought to dismantle the program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Moran cited several problems in the program. Among them, he said, is that while evidence is clear of discrimination against African-American-owned companies, it is virtually non-existent for Asians. That has raised concern among Asian businesses that they may be kicked out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who want to dismantle affirmative action portray Asian Americans as well-educated, affluent and universally successful, said Le. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The use of that myth &ldquo;masks our problems, problems that are a daily reality for our community, poverty, discrimination and the lack of opportunity,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Excluding Asian Americans from this program is part of a national trend at chipping away affirmative action, dividing disadvantaged communities by turning them against each other.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ernest C. Wong, president of landscape architecture firm Site Design Group Ltd., said 70 percent of his business comes from the city&rsquo;s set-aside program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Without the set-aside program, I don&rsquo;t think our firm would survive,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eric Mah said that out of nearly two dozen projects his electrical contracting company has bid on in recent weeks, 19 of them were the result of affirmative-action goals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He shared the story of working on a job site where other workers wore professionally printed stickers that proclaimed &ldquo;Japan sucks.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This made for an extremely hostile job site,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; . . . It&rsquo;s this mind-set that I have to contend with in construction.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city faces a June 29 deadline to revamp the program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Daley spokeswoman said the city wants &ldquo;to include as many groups as possible . . . however, we also have to follow the court&rsquo;s decision. Judge Moran did not find that there was discrimination against the Asian community. We are reviewing all of our options in light of his opinion.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Ald. Ed Burke (14th) said he believes the city&rsquo;s attorneys have &ldquo;misconstrued the decision&rdquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t interpret the judge&rsquo;s ruling as an order to exclude Asian-owned businesses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A mayoral task force, which is charged with rewriting the city&rsquo;s affirmative action ordinance, is conducting the hearing to seek public input on how to adhere to Moran&rsquo;s ruling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, some testifying at the hearing welcomed the revamping of the program, charging that among black-owned businesses only a select few actually benefit.
