				<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/entertainment/3526445.stm">Rappers Unite for Political Power</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Fight the Power, a new documentary on BBC digital station 1Xtra, looks at the role of the hip-hop community in the US political system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>James McNally, BBC News, Mar. 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hip-hop artists have long flirted with politics &mdash; but in the run-up to this year&rsquo;s presidential elections, something unprecedented has happened. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All the Democratic contenders &mdash; from John Kerry and Howard Dean to outsiders like Al Sharpton and Dennis Kucinich &mdash; have courted rap&rsquo;s major players. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even General Wesley Clark got in on the act, qualifying his admission that he knew little about hip-hop by quoting a line from an OutKast song saying they &ldquo;make you shake it like a Polaroid picture&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Just four years ago this would have been unthinkable. Indeed, the only relationship Democratic nominee Al Gore had to rap was through his wife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the early 1990s, Tipper Gore lobbied on behalf of the Parents&rsquo; Music Resource Center to have rap albums marked with parental guidance stickers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Back then, though, rap held a very different position in American culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rap was seen as the music of youthful black rebellion, its politics a hangover from Public Enemy&rsquo;s uncompromising message of black empowerment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as hip-hop activist William &ldquo;Upski&rdquo; Wimsatt points out, rap&rsquo;s political pioneers did little to marry their defiant political rhetoric to actual political action. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the mid-1990s, though, grassroots activist groups such as the Prisons Moratorium Project and the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement started to combine hip-hop and activism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Releasing albums and holding concerts became part of a strategy to raise both funds and awareness. According to Wimsatt, this was the second step in a kind of hip-hop political evolution. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;First you had people like Public Enemy who were talking about political subjects, but not actually starting programmes to organise their community politically,&rdquo; Wimsatt explains. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Then in the mid '90s, you had people come along and realise they can actually use hip-hop as part of a strategy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The third logical step, he says, is to get involved in electoral politics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And that is just what is happening. Hip-hop is influential now in a way that it simply wasn&rsquo;t the time of the last elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Small wonder that the Democrats should try to woo rap&rsquo;s movers and shakers, just as New Labour wanted to get rock stars Noel Gallagher and Damon Albarn on its side in the UK. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the hip-hop community has plans that extend far beyond the marketing strategies of Kerry and Kucinich. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Russell Simmons, boss of Def Jam Records, has set up the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network with the expressed intention of signing up two million hip-hop generation voters before the election. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He has also been making moves into arguably the true seat of political power &mdash; lobbying &mdash; by trying to influence lawmakers on issues that affect the kind of materially deprived communities that first spawned hip-hop. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though less powerful, Wimsatt has set up a coalition himself &mdash; The League of Pissed-Off Voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With the help of rap luminaries like Mos Def, he aims to set up a series of virtual voting blocs so the hip-hop generation can build real power at a political level. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So could hip-hop swing this year&rsquo;s elections? Damon Dash, head of Roc-A-Fella records and board member of the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, is circumspect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Not this year, no. Maybe in 2008,&rdquo; he says. Wimsatt, however, is more optimistic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only will future presidents of the United States have to be thoroughly literate in the culture of hip-hop, he also predicts that within the next 30 years there will be a hip-hop president.
