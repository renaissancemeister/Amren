				Angered by &lsquo;Rigged&rsquo; Georgia Flag Vote, Southern Heritage Groups Call for Boycott
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Kristin Wyatt, AP, SFGate.com, Mar. 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Southern heritage groups called for an economic boycott of Atlanta on Wednesday, a day after Georgia voters overwhelmingly approved a state flag without the divisive Confederate rebel &ldquo;X.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 50 people rallied outside the Capitol, saying tepid turnout for the flag referendum meant people thought it was phony. The ballot didn&rsquo;t allow voters to choose the 1956 version dominated by the Confederate cross of stars. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The rigged referendum yesterday was an insult to the good dignity of every Georgian,&rdquo; said Steve Harris, vice chairman of the Southern Party of Georgia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Large segments of the Georgia General Assembly have more regard for the Yankee dollars&hellip; than they do for the wishes of their constituents,&rdquo; said Ray McBerry of the Georgia League of the South. &ldquo;We encourage Southerners to cease doing business within the city-state of Atlanta.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Voters overwhelmingly chose to keep the red, white and blue banner adopted last year by the Legislature. About three of every four voters chose that flag over a blue flag selected in 2001 to replace the 1956 banner that was dominated by the Confederate battle emblem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Only about one in five registered voters participated in Tuesday&rsquo;s nonbinding referendum. But political leaders of both parties expressed confidence that the referendum will end the flag flap. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We can finally close this chapter in the history of Georgia,&rdquo; said state Sen. George Hooks, a Democrat who helped design the current state flag. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The people of Georgia spoke with great clarity,&rdquo; said Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue, who won the state&rsquo;s top office two years ago in part because of unrest over the 2001 flag. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 1956 flag, which blacks vehemently oppose, was replaced in 2001 by then-Gov. Roy Barnes. The replacement, which included the 1956 flag in miniature with four other flags, caused so much outrage that it helped Perdue oust Barnes in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Perdue promised a referendum on the issue, but authorized yet another state flag last year, based on the former national flag of the Confederacy: two red stripes and one white, extending from a blue field. Defenders of the Confederate emblem felt betrayed by the move. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With neither flag inciting strong emotions, many voters were swayed by aesthetics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a better-looking flag,&rdquo; John Buchner, a graduate student from Athens, said of the banner voters approved.
