<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Duh. News last week that suspected killer Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. would face death penalty consideration in the abduction slaying of Dru Sjodin was as much a surprise as death and taxes.</p>
<p>Factor, at least partially, the &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; angle behind this tragic and emotionally charged case, one that has made national and international headlines.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is a convicted and high-risk sexual predator who was released last year after serving 23 years for a brutal sexual assault. Sjodin was a bubbly, energetic and high-spirited 22-year-old student at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks.</p>
<p>What is known is that Sjodin, of Pequot Lakes, Minn., vanished Nov. 22 after leaving work at a shopping mall in Grand Forks.</p>
<p>I first confirmed that Rodriguez was arrested and charged after the missing girl&rsquo;s blood and DNA were reportedly found in his car. In April, her remains were found in a ravine near the suspect&rsquo;s residence in Crookston, Minn.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t help his situation that at the time, Rodriguez claimed he had gone to the mall to see &ldquo;Once Upon a Time in Mexico,&rdquo; a film authorities confirmed was not being shown then. If he is indeed the culprit, Rodriguez made a grievous mistake by not negotiating a plea with prosecutors before Sjodin&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>Prosecutors would be foolish now to strike any deal. Rodriguez&rsquo;s exposure to death penalty prosecution is not so much an aberration of prosecution discretion, but a consistent one in recent years.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<p>Under U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, the U.S. Justice Department has been three times more likely to seek the death penalty in federal court for minority defendants than non-minority defendants.</p>
<p>At least 75 percent of murder defendants facing federal death penalty trials in recent decades, both under Ashcroft and his predecessor, Janet Reno, were black or non-white. Half of the cases recommended for death penalty prosecution since 2000 have been in states that don&rsquo;t have capital punishment.</p>
<p>Kevin McNally, a Kentucky-based lawyer who helps run a national capital defense counsel project, points out that as of Jan. 26 the federal government has tried 91 federal death penalty cases. According to McNally&rsquo;s group, there are currently 59 death penalty defendants in states or other jurisdictions under U.S. law. Forty-three are African-Americans or members of minority groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Federal prosecutors have great discretion and latitude in which case they select for capital consideration,&rdquo; explains McNally.</p>
<p>A Clinton administration survey of similar prosecution decisions in 2000 confirmed a troubling geographic and racial disparity problem in death penalty case considerations.</p>
<p>More often than not, such cases involve sexual crimes and the victim is a different race than the perpetrator, McNally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As human beings, even prosecutors react to that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can tell you that it is usually the gender and the background of the victim that drives this. Rodriguez is a man of Mexican descent. Sjodin was young, white and female.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In talking about high-profile cases like Dru Sjodin&rsquo;s murder, he said: &ldquo;These are the kind of potential death penalty cases that attract federal prosecutors like bugs to a light bulb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Ney, who is helping to represent Rodriguez at trial, says he doesn&rsquo;t know and wouldn&rsquo;t speculate on the religious or political motives behind last week&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you that there is evidence that the process has been found to be racially and ethnically biased, and has been for quite a while,&rdquo; Ney said.</p>
<p>With an overwhelming body of heinous crimes relegated to state court, the lingering question is whether federal prosecutors are taking the politically easy way out in this case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They really have nothing to lose,&rdquo; Ney said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is juries &mdash; not prosecutors or judges &mdash; that decide who should face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered &mdash; and is being legally challenged in some places &mdash; is how the federal government can override the law of a state that has consistently opposed the death penalty. Perhaps, in the end, it ultimately depends on who the defendant is and who the victim was.</p>
