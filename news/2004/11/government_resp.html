						<p>AMSTERDAM &mdash; The Dutch government faced severe criticism from several quarters on Wednesday for its response to the murder of filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh. </p>
<p>The Arab European League (AEL) went so far as to liken the appearance of Immigration and Integration Minister Rita Verdonk at a rally in Amsterdam to a &ldquo;Hitler speech, with only the little mustache missing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A Moroccan organisation has also described her speech as very negative and criticised her use of a sort &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; rhetoric.</p>
<p>Verdonk was the only one of the three speakers at a special rally in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening to remind the 20,000-strong crowd that the 26-year-old man arrested after the killing held both the Moroccan and Dutch nationalities. </p>
<p>The chairman of the Dutch section of the AEL, Nabil Marmouch, said for Verdonk to follow this remark with a call not to allow the situation to become more polarised was unbelievable. He accused her, along with right wing politicians Geert Wilders and Joost Eerdmans, of working to whip up &ldquo;more hate&rdquo;. He also said she was using the killing for her own electoral gain.</p>
<p>The Belgian-Dutch AEL issued a statement on Tuesday night condemning Van Gogh&rsquo;s murder. Previous statements by the organisation &mdash; which says it supports the integration, but not assimilation of Arabs and Muslims into western societies &mdash; have caused widespread offence. The AEL recently said that the death of every Dutch soldier in Iraq was a victory. </p>
<p>Marmouch said only the person responsible for Van Gogh&rsquo;s death was the person who shot him. He also claimed Van Gogh was bent on offending people and that his death had nothing to do with free speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Van Gogh&rsquo;s] comments such as &lsquo;the pimp of the prophets&rsquo; and &lsquo;goatf*ckers&rsquo; [in relation to Muslims] have nothing to do with freedom of expression&rdquo;. Van Gogh, Marmouch said, was out to offend people: &ldquo;That is what he did and he was good at it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Verdonk also told the crowd on Tuesday that Dutch society had reached a crossroad. &ldquo;It is up to us all to choose what side we are going to take. Do we, following Theo&rsquo;s murder begin a process to get revenge? Or do we say &lsquo;we go no further than here&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said several organisations representing minorities in the Netherlands had already chosen the side they were on by openly condemning the murder. </p>
<p>The Union of Moroccan-Dutch Academics (UMAH) said Verdonk had gone &ldquo;very close to the edge&rdquo; of acceptable comment by mentioning the suspect&rsquo;s dual nationality in her speech. Said Bellari of the UMAH said her &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; rhetoric and her &ldquo;fractured reasoning&rdquo; would harm the cause of integration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her colleagues in the three-party coalition government have also come in for criticism. The coalition is made up of the Christian Democrat CDA, Liberal VVD and Democrat D66 parties.</p>
<p>D66 leader Boris Dittrich said the coalition government&rsquo;s letter to Parliament following the killing raised many more questions than it answered. VVD parliamentary party leader Jozias van Aartsen agreed the letter was acquiescent and unclear on several points.</p>
<p>Independent conservative MP Geert Wilders said Interior Minister Johan Remkes faced a &ldquo;major political problem&rdquo; if he could not adequately explain why the alleged killer had not been on a list of the top 10 most dangerous people in the Netherlands. </p>
<p>Wilders referred to media reports that the suspect had been linked to Samir A., a Muslim man arrested for allegedly plotting bomb attacks on Amsterdam&rsquo;s Schiphol Airport and the Dutch Parliament.</p>
<p>MPs of all parties have asked that the murder be debated further.</p>
