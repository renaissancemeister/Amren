<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CORVALLIS, Ore. &mdash; An Oregon State football player charged with assault was suspended by coach Mike Riley on Monday for violating team policy, as were three of his teammates.</p>
<p>Joseph Rudulph, 19, a freshman from Sacramento, Calif., was arrested Friday after a confrontation with an Oregon National Guard solider at the Headline Cafe in Corvallis.</p>
<p>Teammates Anthony Wheat-Brown, Whitfield Usher and Ryan Rainwater were at the restaurant, but have not been arrested, police said. The university, in a statement, said the suspensions for all four were for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p>The alleged incident happened as Staff Sgt. Gabriel Sapp was dancing with his wife. The couple was allegedly approached by a group of black men, identified as Oregon State football players.</p>
<p>The men began making comments to Sapp&rsquo;s wife, who is also black, about her relationship with her husband,, Corvallis police said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Rudulph then punched Sapp in the face, knocking him to the ground. Sapp, who was celebrating his last night of leave, is back in Iraq.</p>
<p>Rudulph faces assault, harassment and disorderly conduct charges.</p>
<p>The suspensions come as the Beavers prepare for their Civil War matchup with Oregon. A bowl berth is on the line for the 5-5 teams.</p>
<p>Wheat-Brown, a redshirt-freshman receiver from Compton, Calif., has started eight games and is third on the team in receptions with 33. He caught 11 passes in Saturday&rsquo;s 24-19 win over Stanford.</p>
<p>Rudulph, a reserve defensive end, has appeared in nine games this season. Usher and Rainwater have not played this season.</p>
