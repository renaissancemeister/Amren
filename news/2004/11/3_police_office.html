						<p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands &mdash; Suspects holed up in a house under police assault Wednesday threw a hand grenade, injuring three officers conducting the terrorism-related raid.</p>
<p>Authorities closed air space for small planes over the city as part of the operation.</p>
<p>Hague Chief Prosecutor Han Moraal said the raid was part of a &ldquo;continuing investigation into terrorism,&rdquo; but would not confirm whether it was related to the Nov. 2 killing of filmmaker Theo van Gogh by an alleged Islamic radical.</p>
<p>Suspects were still inside the building, Hague Police Chief Gerard Bouwman said at a press conference, and confirmed that police and the suspects had exchanged gunfire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment of assault, a hand grenade was thrown at the arrest team,&rdquo; Bouwman said. &ldquo;It exploded and several officers were hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Wim Deetman said negotiators were trying to end the standoff peacefully.</p>
<p>Several city blocks were cordoned off in a mostly immigrant neighborhood near The Hague&rsquo;s Holland Spoor train station. The building was surrounded by police in riot gear, fire engines, ambulances and SWAT teams.</p>
<p>Bouwman said one of the injured police officers had been briefly treated and sent home, while the other two remained hospitalized, one with serious injuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No vital organs were hurt, but he suffered considerable injuries,&rdquo; Bouwman said.</p>
<p>Sylvia Cordia, 42, who lives across the street from the house, said she saw several explosions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw one policeman crumble to the ground and another was dragged away to safety,&rdquo; she said, adding that the suspects shouted threats in broken Dutch when the police asked them to surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were several people in the house, and I heard a man yelling &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll chop your head off&rsquo; and yelling profanities,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Photographers captured images of a man of Asian descent wearing only boxer shorts being dragged from the building and escorted away, but police would not confirm the apparent arrest.</p>
<p>There have been more than a dozen arson attacks in the Netherlands against churches and mosques since Van Gogh&rsquo;s killing in Amsterdam more than a week ago. An Islamic school in Eindhoven was bombed Monday night, and another in Uden was burned down Tuesday. No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Van Gogh had received death threats after the release of his most recent film about the treatment of women under Islam.</p>
<p>Six suspects, believed to be members of a terrorist group, are being held in custody, including the alleged killer, 26-year-old Mohammed Bouyeri, who holds dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Balkenende said he was &ldquo;concerned about the hardening climate in the Netherlands&rdquo; and condemned the cycle of reprisals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to utterly reject this violence, all together, because we&rsquo;re being un-Dutch,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><em>AP, Nov. 9</em></p>
<p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands &mdash; Suspected arsonists set an Islamic elementary school on fire Tuesday amid a string of attacks following the killing of a Dutch filmmaker by an alleged Islamic extremist. </p>
<p>Firefighters struggled to extinguish the flames at the burning Bedir school in the southern town of Uden, where someone had scrawled &ldquo;Theo Rest in Peace&rdquo; in the building in homage to slain filmmaker Theo van Gogh, but the building was destroyed in the blaze. </p>
<p>Uden Mayor Joke Kersten told Dutch television she didn&rsquo;t know the exact cause of the fire but suspected arson. She said the school had not been the target of prior attacks. </p>
<p>Arsonists attempted to burn down Protestant churches in Rotterdam, Utrecht and Amersfoort in apparent retaliation for the bombing of a Muslim elementary school in Eindhoven on Monday, police said. </p>
<p>Muslim sites have been the target of a half-dozen attacks in the past week. No injuries have been reported and no arrests have been made. </p>
<p>Tensions have been high in the Netherlands in the week since the murder of Van Gogh, who was shot and stabbed in Amsterdam by an alleged Islamic radical after making a movie critical of Islam. A funeral was held for Van Gogh on Tuesday. </p>
<p>In Utrecht, police arrived Tuesday to find that a church window had been smashed and a container of flammable liquid thrown inside. In Amersfoort, several Molotov cocktails were thrown at the outside wall of a church.</p>
