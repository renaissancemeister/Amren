<h1>League Of The South Stages Demonstration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Crystal Bonvillian, Montgomery Advertiser, Oct. 23</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Driving past the Southern Poverty Law Center, motorists honked, hooted and hollered Friday afternoon at a group of Southerners protesting the center&rsquo;s perceived attitude toward the South. </p>
<p>About 30 protesters, in Montgomery for the National League of the South&rsquo;s annual meeting, waved Confederate and state flags and held up signs calling center director Morris Dees a &ldquo;scalawag.&rdquo; </p>
<p>At the corner of Washington Avenue and South Hull Street sat a toilet with jeans-clad legs protruding from the bowl. A sign said &ldquo;Flush the <span class="caps">SPLC.</span>&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dees, whose mother died Friday, could not be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Robert B. Hayes, director of the South Carolina League of the South, said the group was there to protest the center, which he called a &ldquo;hate institution.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;They hate everything that has to do with the South and with Southern culture,&rdquo; Hayes said. &ldquo;They hate Christianity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Hayes and Ray McBerry, chairman of the group&rsquo;s Georgia chapter, blasted the center for its attempts to keep a controversial Ten Commandments monument out of the Alabama Judicial Building. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no constitutional requirement for states not to support religion,&rdquo; Hayes said. &ldquo;You will not find separation of church and state anywhere in the Constitution.&rdquo; </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/11/leagueofsouth.jpg" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:1em" /> McBerry said his group is in the process of having copies of the Commandments put in all Georgia county courthouses. He accused Dees and the center of &ldquo;bypassing the will of the people&rdquo; by going to the judiciary to stop the religious display. </p>
<p>McBerry said Dees also has misrepresented the League of the South by calling it a hate group. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They said we are a racist organization, when in truth we have several black members and members of other races,&rdquo; McBerry said. &ldquo;They also portrayed us as a domestic terrorist group when we fully and wholeheartedly embrace the Constitution.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re a group of race hustlers,&rdquo; said Jim Walters of Lewisville, Texas. &ldquo;They are anti-Christian, anti-Southern and anti-American.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Walters said all the Southern group wants is to give power back to the people of America. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All we want is fairness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want power. We want to devolve it.&rdquo;</p>
