<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BOSTON &mdash; Security at Logan International Airport, praised for its overhaul after Sept. 11, 2001, has come under fire for a technique that allows police to stop and question people they believe are behaving suspiciously. </p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the &ldquo;behavior pattern recognition&rdquo; program at Logan &mdash; where two planes were hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center &mdash; saying it &ldquo;effectively condones and encourages&rdquo; racial and ethnic profiling. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of King Downing, the ACLU&rsquo;s national coordinator for racial profiling, who alleged he was harassed by state police last year. It seeks unspecified monetary damages, and asks the court to declare the screening system unconstitutional. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This program is another unfortunate example of the extent to which we are being asked to surrender basic freedoms in the name of security,&rdquo; said John Reinstein, legal director of the ACLU&rsquo;s Massachusetts chapter. &ldquo;This allows the police to stop anyone, any time, for any reason.&rdquo; </p>
<p>State police insist they focus on travelers&rsquo; behavior, including loitering without luggage, wearing heavy clothes on a hot day and watching security methods at the airport. </p>
<p>George N. Naccara, the federal security director at Logan under the Transportation Security Administration, said troopers are trained not to stop people based on race or ethnicity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They make it very clear in the training that we&rsquo;re looking for abnormalities in behavior, and they begin their thought process very carefully,&rdquo; Naccara said. </p>
<p>Downing said he was asked for identification while he was making a phone call in October 2003 at Logan. He refused because he did not know the basis for the request, he said &mdash; and was told to leave. As he tried to depart, he was told he was under arrest for failing to produce identification. </p>
<p>Downing said he subsequently produced a driver&rsquo;s license and travel documents and was allowed to go; no charges were filed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t done anything wrong and I definitely hadn&rsquo;t done anything suspicious,&rdquo; Downing said. &ldquo;All I was left to suspect was the fact that I was a person of color might have been the motivating factor.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In a statement, state police said they are &ldquo;committed to protecting the constitutional civil rights of all citizens.&rdquo; The statement said an investigation had been &ldquo;complicated by the unwillingness of the ACLU to cooperate,&rdquo; and that phone calls and a registered letter had not been answered.</p>
