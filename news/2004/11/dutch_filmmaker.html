						<p>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands &mdash; A Dutch filmmaker who had received death threats after releasing a movie criticizing the treatment of women under Islam was slain in Amsterdam on Tuesday, police said. </p>
<p>A suspect, a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch-Moroccan nationality, was arrested after a shootout with officers that left him wounded, police said. </p>
<p>Filmmaker Theo van Gogh had been threatened after the August airing of the movie &ldquo;Submission,&rdquo; which he made with a right-wing Dutch politician who had renounced the Islamic faith of her birth. Van Gogh had received police protection after its release. </p>
<p>Dutch national broadcaster NOS and other media reported that Van Gogh&rsquo;s killer shot and stabbed his victim and left a note on his body. NOS said witnesses described the attacker as having an &ldquo;Arab appearance.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A witness who lives in the neighborhood heard six shots, and saw the man concealing a gun. She said he walked away slowly, spoke to someone at the edge of the park, and then ran. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He was walking slowly, like he was trying to be cool,&rdquo; she said, describing him as wearing a long beard and Islamic garb. &ldquo;He was either an Arabic man or someone disguised as a Muslim,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Another witness told Dutch Radio 1 the killer arrived by bicycle and shot Van Gogh as he got out of a car. &ldquo;He fell backward on the bicycle path and just laid there. The shooter stayed next to him and waited. Waited to make sure he was dead.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The slain filmmaker was the great grandson of the brother of famous Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, who was also named Theo. In a recent radio interview, Van Gogh dismissed the threats and called the movie &ldquo;the best protection I could have. It&rsquo;s not something I worry about.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called on the Dutch people to remain calm. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is known about the motive,&rdquo; he said in a written statement. &ldquo;I want to call on everyone not to jump to far-reaching conclusions. The facts must first be carefully weighed so let&rsquo;s allow the investigators to do their jobs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Balkenende praised Van Gogh as a proponent of free speech who had &ldquo;outspoken opinions.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be unacceptable if a difference of opinion led to this brutal murder,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Police spokesman Eric Vermeulen said the attacker fled to the nearby East Park, and was arrested after exchanging gunfire with police. Both the suspect and a policeman suffered minor injuries. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They were conscious&rdquo; when taken to hospital, Vermeulen said. </p>
<p>Van Gogh&rsquo;s killing immediately rekindled memories of the 2002 assassination of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn who polarized the nation with his anti-immigration views and was shot to death days before national elections. </p>
<p>In addition to his film, van Gogh also wrote columns about Islam that were published on his Web site, www.theovangogh.nl, and Dutch newspaper Metro. </p>
<p>The short television film &ldquo;Submission&rdquo; aired on Dutch television in August, enraged the Muslim community in the Netherlands. </p>
<p>It told the fictional story of a Muslim woman forced into a violent marriage, raped by a relative and brutally punished for adultery. </p>
<p>The English-language film was scripted by a right-wing politician who years ago renounced the Islamic faith of her birth and now refers to herself as an &ldquo;ex-Muslim.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Somali-born Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a member of the Dutch parliament, has repeatedly outraged fellow Muslims by criticizing Islamic customs and the failure of Muslim families to adopt Dutch ways. </p>
<p>The place of Muslim immigrants in Dutch society has long been a contentious issue in the Netherlands, where many right-wing politicians have pushed for tougher immigration laws and say Muslims already settled in the country must make a greater effort to assimilate. </p>
<p>Theo van Gogh, 47, has often come under criticism for his controversial movies. In December, his next movie &ldquo;06-05,&rdquo; about the May 6, 2002 assassination of Pim Fortuyn, is scheduled to debut on the Internet.</p>
