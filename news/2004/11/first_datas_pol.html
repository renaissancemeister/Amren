<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p><p>While I was being checked by paramedics after being assaulted by a Mexican national at First Data/Western Union&rsquo;s Immigration Reform Forum in Denver on July 22, 2004, Polly Baca took the podium microphone to assure the largely Latino audience that my attacker would have a lawyer. </p></p>
<p><p>Baca, a Director of First Data/Western Union&rsquo;s Foundation (<i>www.firstdatawesternunion.org</i>), also heads Denver nonprofit LARASA (&#147;The Race&#148;) an open-borders nonprofit advocacy group funded by the Foundation. </p></p>
<p><p>A high profile spokespiece for Mexican illegal and legal immigrants, Baca has built a reputation as one of the nation&rsquo;s most successful &#147;Chicanas,&#148; a term coined in the &lsquo;60s meaning females of Mexican descent born in the United States. </p></p>
<p><p>But the truth is, Polly Baca is no Chicana; she is <i>pura Espanola</i> descended from Spanish Conquistadors. The Baca family is among elite Spanish land grantees who expanded Spain&rsquo;s empire by seizing land from North American and Mexican Indians. </p></p>
<p><b><p>BACA&rsquo;S SPANISH WAYS </p><br>
</b><br>
<p>A fourth-generation Coloradan born in Greeley in 1943, Baca was taught by her parents to be mindful and proud of her Spanish lineage. Her family celebrated its sophisticated, civilized Spanish-European heritage as distinct from that of barbaric colonial Mexico&mdash;where Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes found human sacrifice and cannibalism rampant. When Spanish-owned land folded into America, Baca&rsquo;s family chose to stay rather than move to Mexico. </p></p>
<p><p>In a frank interview, (www.bookrags.com/biography/polly-baca-barragan), Baca reveals a deep-seated resentment that her Spanish-American family was often mistaken for Mexican-Americans. She recounts that as a child, she wanted to sit with &#147;Anglos&#148; at her church, but that her family was ushered to the side aisles. &#147;They assumed we were Mexican Americans from the other side of the tracks,&#148;she sniffs. </p></p>
<p><p>When her mother forces the Baca family to move to a &#147;low income, racially mixed neighborhood&rsquo; in Northern Colorado&mdash;&#148;not the Spanish neighborhood&#148;&mdash;Baca recalls that, &#147;We called it the Spanish American colony because we were from Colorado and from the old Spanish families.&#148; </p></p>
<p><b><p>MEXICAN MASQUERADE BEGINS </p><br>
</b><br>
<p>Perhaps Baca&rsquo;s job in the late 60s with the Ford Foundation-funded National Council of <i>La Raza</i> (&#147;The Race&#148;)&mdash;a leader in the ethnic hustling trade&mdash;taught her that a transformation from Conquistadora to Chicana would serve her well. </p></p>
<p><p>Over the coming years, Baca deliberately cultivated a false identity, posing as a struggling yet successful-against-the-odds Mexican-American, an identity she had once found repugnant. </p></p>
<p><p>In her 1991 speech entitled &#147;Silent No More&mdash;A Chicana&rsquo;s Vision for Leadership&#148; at Stanford University&rsquo;s Center For Chicano Research (SCCR), Baca shamelessly misrepresents herself as a Mexican-American &#147;Chicana.&#148; Speaking of stories that Mexicans tell their children about their struggle with invading Spaniards, she sighs: &#147;Oh the stories *we* were told,&#148; Decrying her Chicana victimization, she becomes champion of her charade asserting that &#147;If Chicanas continue to be relegated to this second class status, *we* &hellip; .&#148; blah blah blah. Ironically, she warns of &#147;the corruption of leadership that Chicanas must guard against, lest *we* fall prey to that against which we have struggled for generations.&#148; Corruption of leadership, indeed. </p></p>
<p><p>In his preface to Baca&rsquo;s remarks, SCCR Director Luis Ricardo Fraga Director repeats Baca&rsquo;s lies, stating that, &#147; &hellip; [Baca] served as the only Chicana in the Colorado state senate,&#148; &hellip; adding that &hellip; &#147;It was not surprising that Ms. Baca chose as the topic of her lecture the distinct perspective that a Chicana can provide to public leadership,&#148; he says. Surprising? No; deceitful? Yes! (</font><a href="/pdfs/6th_Annual_Lecture_1991.pdf">https://ccsre.stanford.edu/pdfs/6th_Annual_Lecture_1991.pdf</font></a>) </p></p>
<p><p>Fraga probably did not know that Baca was simply following in the footsteps of her great-great uncle, <i>el estimado Senor </i>Don Felipe Baca, who served as a Spanish-American Senator from Trinidad in the Colorado Territorial Legislature in 1870, more than 100 years before <i>poseur</i> Polly was elected to the same body as a &#147;Chicana.&#148; Fraga&rsquo;s observation that &#147;Polly became the first&mdash;and only&mdash;minority woman to be elected to the Colorado Senate&#148; belied her European ancestry. (</font><a href="/js">../../../../js</font></a>) </p></p>
<p><p>Baca continues her self-serving Mexican masquerade as she describes her unsuccessful run in 1986 for the US Congress, saying, &#147;I had hoped to change the makeup of Congress by adding a Chicana to its ranks &hellip; &#147; </p></p>
<p><p>In October 2000, authors Jose Angel Gutierrez and Rebecca E. Deen laud Baca&rsquo;s achievements in &#147;Chicanas in Texas Politics,&#148; published as part of the University of Texas-Arlington, Latino Studies Series. Reiterating that Chicanas are &#147;women of Mexican ancestry&#148;, they note that &#147; &hellip; several Chicanas held high level state agency appointed positions; and one state senator in Colorado, Polly Baca Barragan, had been elected.&#148; </p></p>
<p><b><p>ETHNIC IDENTITY THEFT&mdash;TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES? </p><br>
</b><br>
<p>Identity theft is a profitable crime and Baca&rsquo;s <i>Chicana-</i>ry has helped her gain clients, credibility and prestigious positions such as Director of the multimillion dollar First Data/Western Union Foundation&mdash;which focuses on funding open-borders causes and non-profits. Baca la Chicana has held many powerful positions in the DNC, and her recent appointment to Burger King&rsquo;s Diversity Action Council surely was not made because of her Spanish land grant lineage. </p></p>
<p><p>Resume fraud is a serious matter. Polly Baca&rsquo;s claim to being a Chicana with minority status&mdash;a claim purposefully designed to further her political and professional ambitions on the backs of Mexican-Americans&mdash;is a deception that cannot be ignored or tolerated. </p></p>
