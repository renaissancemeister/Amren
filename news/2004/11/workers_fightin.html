<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Aurora &mdash; Luz Ornelas and Guadelupe Coronado say they were humiliated and degraded when their boss forbade them from speaking their native Spanish while working at a Family Dollar store on East Colfax Avenue. </p>
<p>Not long after, they say, they were fired along with five other Spanish-speaking employees and replaced with workers who spoke only English.</p>
<p>The women recently filed a lawsuit in federal court, saying their civil rights were violated and asking for unspecified damages.</p>
<p>Employers in Colorado and nationwide are increasingly wrestling with language issues as the workforce diversifies.</p>
<p>Claims against workplace English-only rules have increased 612 percent, from 32 cases in 1996 to 228 in 2002, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still only a fraction of the EEOC&rsquo;s 9,000 annual claims of national-origin discrimination.</p>
<p>Legal experts say the number is low because workers don&rsquo;t know about the law or are worried about losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The dollar-store litigation joins a recent filing against a Northglenn McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant, where the accuser says workers were forced to deposit 25 cents into an &ldquo;English-only&rdquo; cup every time they spoke Spanish. McDonald&rsquo;s corporate officials say they have no English- only policies.</p>
<p>Federal rules forbid blanket English-only policies in workplaces. However, EEOC rules allow employers to have language policies if they can prove they&rsquo;re for a &ldquo;business necessity&rdquo; or for safety reasons.</p>
<p>In general, the EEOC prosecutes only a handful of English- only cases every year.</p>
<p>David Grinberg, EEOC spokesman, said more English- only claims are being filed as the workplace diversifies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see it as a growing trend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to strike a balance between businesses and employees speaking their native language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grinberg said the EEOC&rsquo;s mission is to help employers learn the law and not to become the language police.</p>
<p>The most recent case in Colorado occurred last year, when the EEOC settled a $1.5 million case against a Black Hawk casino that required its mostly Hispanic cleaning staff to speak only English.</p>
<p>The agency usually investigates claims and issues a &ldquo;notice of right to sue,&rdquo; allowing individuals to proceed with litigation on their own.</p>
<p>In those cases, courts have sent mixed messages &mdash; sometimes ruling for employees and sometimes for employers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Denver attorney Leonard Martinez said he continues to hear from people wanting to sue. Many of those allegations involve English-only policies, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an area of the law that employers don&rsquo;t have a grasp on,&rdquo; said Martinez, who represents Ornelas and Coronado. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an issue that needs to be addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ornelas is a 35-year-old single mother of two who worked for $8 an hour as assistant manager at the Family Dollar store. She is from Mexico City and has limited English skills.</p>
<p>Coronado is a 36-year-old mother of three from El Salvador who worked for $7 an hour as a stocker and occasional checker. She cannot speak English. Both women are in the United States legally.</p>
<p>The women said their bosses knew about their limited English skills when they were hired but later demanded they stop speaking Spanish in the store, which serves a predominantly Latino clientele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to do to someone else what they did to me and humiliate my people,&rdquo; Coronado said recently through an interpreter.</p>
<p>Family Dollar officials wouldn&rsquo;t comment on the case.</p>
<p>English-only advocates fear increasing litigation is creating a chilling effect for businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These (cases) are going to continue to grow until we have a commitment to have everyone speak English,&rdquo; said Tim Schultz, spokesman and staff counsel for U.S. English Inc., a Washington, D.C., group dedicated to preserving English in the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Businesses should have a right to have their employees speak English,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The solution is a bigger-picture solution: Make sure immigrants are learning English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karl Krahnke, a linguistics professor at Colorado State University, doubts that will work. Most immigrants over 25 years old probably won&rsquo;t become proficient in a new language, he said. And it shouldn&rsquo;t be required, either, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unethical to require them to give up their first language,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I speak Spanish and we&rsquo;re close friends and you speak Spanish, to be forced to talk about our families, feelings, illness or whatever in English just because we&rsquo;re out of our house is unfair and unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
