						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; With his selection of Cuban-born Carlos Gutierrez to be his Commerce secretary yesterday, President Bush advanced what strategists say is a comprehensive effort to transform his success among Hispanic voters in this year&rsquo;s elections into a long-term gain for Republicans. </p>
<p>Gutierrez, 51, is the second Hispanic to gain Bush&rsquo;s nod for a Cabinet post since his re-election, after his selection of top White House lawyer Alberto Gonzalez, who is a Mexican American, for attorney general. Gutierrez would replace Bush&rsquo;s Texas-bred confidant Donald Evans. </p>
<p>While Bush&rsquo;s critics say he is practicing tokenism without offering Hispanics any progress on important issues like immigration, his allies say he is setting his party up to make substantial inroads among a vital and growing voting bloc, cutting into Democrats&rsquo; historic advantage. </p>
<p>Bush lost the Hispanic vote to Sen. John Kerry this year, with exit surveys showing the president won 44 percent to the Democrat&rsquo;s 53 percent. Pollsters squabble about that margin, but virtually all concede Bush&rsquo;s share of the Hispanic vote rose &mdash; some say by as much as nine points &mdash; compared to his performance in the 2000 election. </p>
<p>Strategists saw Bush&rsquo;s gain as the start of a shift away from historical trends, in which Hispanics as a group traditionally backed Democrats because of their support for liberal immigration standards and social programs. </p>
<p>To many, it reflects the culmination of a decadelong quest by Bush, orchestrated by his political guru Karl Rove, to establish a firm national foothold among the Hispanic electorate, and a foundation for future Republican gains. </p>
<p>Prominent Hispanics who are close to Bush cheered Gutierrez&rsquo;s appointment as proof the president is committed to offering their community an influential role in his administration. But some cautioned that Bush, who enjoys a personal tie to the voting bloc that dates to his days as governor of Texas, faces a challenge in capitalizing on his success for the benefit of future Republican candidates. Accomplishing that goal could be a vital element of Bush&rsquo;s political legacy. </p>
<p>Hispanic leaders and strategists say Bush likely will seek more opportunities to hand prominent posts to Hispanic leaders, including possibly nominating a Hispanic for the Supreme Court, recruiting new political talent around the country, and pushing priorities they prize &mdash; including an immigration-reform proposal the president has long promised, but not yet delivered. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s going to take a continuation of his message and an equal commitment by the state Republican parties to speak to this community and take on their issues,&rdquo; said Mario Rodriguez, a California-based advertising executive who is the chairman of the Latino Coalition and a close ally of the president. &ldquo;The template is there, and it&rsquo;s not rocket science &mdash; it&rsquo;s just honest caring about a community that is going to be such a large part of this country, and it&rsquo;s only going to grow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hispanic vote,&rdquo; Rodriguez said, &ldquo;has woken up.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Liberal-leaning Hispanic groups that have faulted Bush for failing to prioritize their members&rsquo; causes have said they hope that Bush&rsquo;s nominations presage a fundamental policy shift by his administration. </p>
<p>Lauding Bush&rsquo;s selection of Gutierrez yesterday, Janet Murguia, the president of the National Council of La Raza, said the group&rsquo;s members &ldquo;are optimistic&rdquo; that the nomination, coupled with that of Gonzalez, &ldquo;will lead to a greater focus on some of the issues most pressing to the Latino community.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But even if there is no radical policy shift, some Democrats say Bush and his political advisers have made great strides with Hispanic voters just by courting them as a swing constituency and giving influential jobs to their stars. </p>
<p>&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s find a Hispanic&rsquo; &hellip; nominees, they&rsquo;ve gone out and found good people, qualified people, leaders in their fields,&rdquo; said Joe Garcia of the New Democratic Network. &ldquo;Hispanics don&rsquo;t want to be appealed to as some minority group; they want to be appealed to as players.&rdquo;</p>
