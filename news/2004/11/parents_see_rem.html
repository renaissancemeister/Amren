						<p>Racism is in the eye of the beholder at Thornton Fractional South High School.</p>
<p>An old battle has reignited at this south suburban school over the Confederate flag &mdash; Thornton South&rsquo;s logo for 35 years until it was banned by the District 215 School Board in June 1993. </p>
<p>Those who defended it then argued the flag and its &ldquo;Rebels&rdquo; mascot were harmless, adopted when the school was established in 1958 with an all-white enrollment, to symbolize its &ldquo;secession&rdquo; from Thornton North in Calumet City. </p>
<p>But the two black parents who ignited the 1993 debate and civil rights leaders argued the symbol honors the battle of the Old South to continue enslaving blacks. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The flag became a huge issue. The Board of Ed struggled with this issue and made the decision to dump the Confederate flag. There are no longer any Confederate flags in the building,&rdquo; says District 215 Supt. Robert Wilhite. </p>
<p>But just as in 1993, a handful of black parents have taken up arms against the status quo. </p>
<p>Part of their battle is over a seemingly small, pre-1993 remnant &mdash; a vest sewn from a Confederate flag &mdash; once worn by a Thornton principal on &ldquo;school pride&rdquo; days and still inside a display case at the school&rsquo;s front entrance. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like what it stands for. It should be removed,&rdquo; said one black parent, the Rev. Dorothy Burton. </p>
<p>And the parents have challenged a larger sleeping tiger, a 30-foot wall mural with a Confederate flag background outside the gymnasium. </p>
<p>Black students say it should have been altered to remove the flag backdrop long ago. </p>
<p>In 1994, the flag was retired from flying outside school, from T-shirts and jackets sold inside and from the uniform of mascot Richie the Rebel. </p>
<p>School officials say other depictions on cafeteria and gym walls were painted over. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Should have changed mural&rsquo; </p>
<p>But, said black student Latisha Calhoun, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have &lsquo;a little&rsquo; racism. They should have changed the mural, too.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My parents have complained. These are Confederate flags, any way you look at it,&rdquo; student Jeremy Corney said. </p>
<p>A decade ago, when black parents first objected to the Confederate flag as a symbol of the school, blacks made up 9 percent of the student population. Today, blacks represent 28 percent. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a racial thing. I think some parents are overreacting,&rdquo; said Hispanic student Giovanni Yarber. </p>
<p>White student Nicole Fuscaldo disagreed: &ldquo;I can understand why black students want a symbol of slavery gone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Thornton South&rsquo;s enrollment area spans ethnically diverse Burnham, Calumet City, Lansing and Lynwood. </p>
<p>Officials thought the flag issue was long buried, and they are befuddled by black parents&rsquo; perception of the vest and mural. &ldquo;The display case does not contain a flag,&rdquo; Wilhite said. &ldquo;This was a vest the principal wore&hellip; . He wore it all through the building to show school pride. I&rsquo;m sorry they feel hurt by that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&lsquo;Racist and offensive&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no Confederate flag in that mural,&rdquo; said John Hallberg, principal of Thornton&rsquo;s 1,600 students. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s racist and offensive. But look at the race of our staff,&rdquo; said a black teacher, who declined to be identified. </p>
<p>About 94 percent of District 215&rsquo;s 184 teachers are white; 3.8 percent are black, and 1.6 percent are Hispanic. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish someone had said something to us about the vest and mural. We thought it wasn&rsquo;t an issue,&rdquo; Hallberg said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If a group of parents come to me, we&rsquo;d take it under consideration. I want all the kids to be proud of their high school,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was among a group of parents who spoke to Principal Hallberg about the flag issue at the beginning of the year &hellip;&rdquo; said black parent Tamara Calhoun. &ldquo;Will they remove it? I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
