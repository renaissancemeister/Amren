						<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; In a complaint to the Federal Elections Commission, the National Republican Campaign Committee accused radio station KFI-AM (640) co-hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou of &ldquo;criminal behavior&rdquo; for attacking Rep. David Dreier, R-Glendora, and endorsing his Democratic opponent, Cynthia Matthews. </p>
<p>By criticizing Dreier&rsquo;s positions on immigration, promoting a &ldquo;Fire Dreier&rdquo; campaign and making on-air appeals for voters to elect Matthews, the NRCC said, the hosts gave Matthews an unlawful corporate, in-kind contribution of more than $25,000. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This behavior is illegal and must be appropriately punished,&rdquo; the NRCC charged, noting violation of the law carries a penalty of fines and jail time. </p>
<p>The complaint echoes objections the Democratic Party made earlier this month when Sinclair Broadcasting Group Inc. prepared to pre-empt regular programming before Election Day to show a documentary critical of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. </p>
<p>Campaign finance experts, however, said election law explicitly allows the media to make editorial comments &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s Rush Limbaugh endorsing President George W. Bush, Al Franken backing Sen. John Kerry, or John and Ken pushing for Matthews. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kobylt and Chiampou are having a field day with the threat. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to jail,&rdquo; Kobylt said brightly in a telephone interview Friday. </p>
<p>Of the accusation, he said, &ldquo;If they really believe it, I think they&rsquo;re nuts.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Kobylt said he believes the NRCC wanted to &ldquo;spook&rdquo; KFI&rsquo;s owner, Clear Channel Communications, into &ldquo;shutting us up&rdquo; before Election Day. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear Channel is perceived as a Republican company,&rdquo; Kobylt said. &ldquo;They (the NRCC) might have thought between the corporate bias and the lawyer factor they&rsquo;d get us to shut up.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He went on to note that his show was equally active in promoting the recall of former California Gov. Gray Davis and the election of Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. Dreier co-chaired Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s campaign. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Congressman Dreier was on our show often and never complained&rdquo; that the station was making an illegal campaign contribution, Kobylt said. </p>
<p>Dreier did not join the NRCC in filing the complaint, nor is he a direct party to it. </p>
<p>NRCC spokesman Bo Harmon refused to comment on the complaint. Dreier spokesman Jo Maney also did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Republican political consultant Allan Hoffenblum said he has little doubt Dreier will easily win a 13th term in office on Tuesday, despite the radio campaign against him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they even bring attention to it?&rdquo; Hoffenblum wondered. </p>
<p><a href="https://washingtontimes.com/national/20041031-125203-8433r.htm"><div class="title">Dreier Targeted On Immigration</div></a></p>
<p><em>Valerie Richardson, Washington Times, Oct. 31</em></p>
<p>House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier is waging a furious re-election battle after he was targeted by a Los Angeles radio talk show as a &ldquo;political human sacrifice&rdquo; for his record on illegal immigration. </p>
<p>In the past month, Mr. Dreier and Republicans have spent an estimated $1 million to blanket his district with fliers and radio ads aimed at countering the massive &ldquo;Fire Dreier&rdquo; campaign led by &ldquo;The John and Ken Show&rdquo; on KFI-AM in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Dreier, California Republican, and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) filed a Federal Elections Commission complaint against Clear Channel Inc., which owns KFI-AM. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s basically complaining that we&rsquo;re picking on him and supporting his opponent,&rdquo; said John Kobylt, who hosts the show with Ken Champiou. </p>
<p>Mr. Dreier, who received a D+ from the Americans for Better Immigration, was targeted for defeat by listeners of the show in August. By taking down a Republican congressman, Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Champiou say they hope to jolt the party into cracking down on the flood of illegal aliens crossing the border from Mexico. </p>
<p>Since then, the show has devoted hours of airtime urging listeners to vote for Mr. Dreier&rsquo;s challenger, Democrat Cynthia Matthews. A first-time candidate, Ms. Matthews has defied her party by adopting a tough stance on illegal immigration and thus becoming the only Democrat to win the endorsement of Americans for Legal Immigration. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have is a U.S. representative who&rsquo;s taking his salary from the taxpayers and legal immigrants and then representing people who are here illegally,&rdquo; Ms. Matthews said. </p>
<p>Most of her volunteers are Republicans, drawn to her campaign by the radio show. Her campaign also has benefited from two spin-off blogs, FireDreier and Disciples of John and Ken, which are promoting her candidacy. </p>
<p>Ms. Matthews plans to join Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Champiou for a live broadcast tomorrow outside Mr. Dreier&rsquo;s Glendora, Calif., office. A September rally drew hundreds of listeners waving anti-Dreier signs and chanting, &ldquo;Fire Dreier!&rdquo; </p>
<p>A 24-year House veteran who hasn&rsquo;t faced a formidable foe in two decades, Mr. Dreier appeared to be ignoring the hoopla until he received the results of an internal poll Oct. 6, said his opponents. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing he got some ugly numbers,&rdquo; Mr. Kobylt said. &ldquo;Since then, he&rsquo;s probably spent $1 million in advertising. He&rsquo;s even running ads during our show.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Dreier campaign did not respond to messages. Last week, however, he defended his record on illegal immigration to a local newspaper. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never gone through anything like this. It&rsquo;s the most blatant mischaracterization of the work I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; Mr. Dreier told the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. &ldquo;I take a back seat to no one on the issue of illegal immigration, yet I&rsquo;m being painted as a coyote.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Dreier camp also has swung back with a phone message from Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Dreier pal, who says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anybody fool you: David Dreier is tough as nails on illegal immigration. No driver&rsquo;s licenses, no amnesty.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Mr. Dreier introduced legislation to hire 700 new border enforcement agents and protect Social Security cards from fraud, a move his opponents blasted as a shameless ploy to bolster his record. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All of a sudden, he&rsquo;s active, introducing legislation, filing complaints, putting out hit pieces,&rdquo; Ms. Matthews said. &ldquo;But people are tired of it. It&rsquo;s too little, too late.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The FEC complaint, filed Oct. 14, accuses Clear Channel of engaging in &ldquo;illegal corporate coordination by promoting Cynthia Matthews&rsquo; congressional campaign.&rdquo; Mr. Kobylt said that the station&rsquo;s lawyers described the complaint as &ldquo;frivolous.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect he [Mr. Dreier] thought that the Clear Channel lawyers would tell us to shut up and give him a few days&rsquo; peace,&rdquo; Mr. Kobylt said. </p>
<p>Instead, the hosts spent two days lambasting Mr. Dreier and the NRCC for trying to infringe on their free-speech rights. They noted that no Republicans complained when the show rallied for the recall of former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis last year. Mr. Drier was the co-chairman of Mr. Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s campaign. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been doing this for 14 years, and we&rsquo;ve never had a reaction like this from a politician,&rdquo; Mr. Kobylt said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really massive hypocrisy. Republicans have gotten a good ride with talk radio; then one show goes after one Republican, and suddenly they want to shut us up?&rdquo;</p>
