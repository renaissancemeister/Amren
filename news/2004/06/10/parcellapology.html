			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>AP, Newsday.com, Jun. 7</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				IRVING, Texas &mdash; Bill Parcells apologized Monday for calling the surprise plays used in practice &ldquo;Jap plays,&rdquo; saying the remark was inappropriate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Dallas Cowboys coach was talking to reporters at the team&rsquo;s minicamp about how his quarterbacks coach and defensive coordinator try to outdo each other when he made the comment, an apparent reference to Japan&rsquo;s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to keep an eye on those two, because they&rsquo;re going to try to get the upper hand,&rdquo; Parcells said about Sean Payton and Mike Zimmer. &ldquo;Mike wants the defense to do well, and Sean, he&rsquo;s going to have a few . . . no disrespect for the Orientals, but what we call Jap plays. OK, surprise things.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Akira Kuboshima, the editor of Japan&rsquo;s American Football Magazine who was in the room, said he wasn&rsquo;t offended but believed some people would be. He also said he was surprised more by the reaction of other reporters than the comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is a lot of chance for someone to feel offended,&rdquo; Kuboshima said. &ldquo;To me, it was no big deal.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple apologized on behalf of the organization, and Parcells later issued a statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I made a very inappropriate reference, and although I prefaced it with the remark, &lsquo;no disrespect to anyone intended,&rsquo; it was still uncalled for and inconsiderate,&rdquo; Parcells said in the statement. &ldquo;For that I apologize to anyone who may have been offended.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The remark was only part of Parcells&rsquo; 45-minute session with reporters, in which he also talked about the team&rsquo;s quarterback competition and some of the new players. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After three straight 5-11 seasons, the Cowboys went 10-6 and reached the playoffs in their first year under Parcells. Still, he expects better in 2004. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll win more games,&rdquo; Parcells said. &ldquo;That just means I think from head to toe that we have a chance to be better.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who had two of his Pro Bowl seasons for Parcells while with the New York Jets, came to Dallas in a trade with Tampa Bay. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Vinny Testaverde was reunited with his old coach last week, leaving the Jets as a free agent. The 40-year-old quarterback will compete for the starting job with incumbent Quincy Carter and serve as a mentor to Drew Henson, who was added this spring after he quit professional baseball. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These guys that were here last year, they&rsquo;ve already bought into it. From that alone, we&rsquo;ll be a better team,&rdquo; running back Richie Anderson said. &ldquo;We already know what to expect. He&rsquo;s not going to allow certain things to happen or go on.&rdquo;
