			<h1>
				Official U.S. &lsquo;Sorry&rsquo; Urged To Nation&rsquo;s &lsquo;Native Peoples&rsquo; 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Scott Canon, Seattle Times, Jun. 8</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				KANSAS CITY, Mo. &mdash; After centuries of deal-breaking, land-taking and what many tribes consider genocide, some U.S. politicians want the government to offer American Indians an apology. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., has sponsored a resolution apologizing &ldquo;to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States&rdquo; as a way to smooth the often-rocky relations between the two. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;(But) before reconciliation,&rdquo; Brownback said in remarks entered in the Congressional Record, &ldquo;there must be recognition and repentance.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				To that end, his resolution lists a few reasons for an apology &mdash; things such as the deadly Trail of Tears march of Cherokee from North Carolina to Oklahoma &mdash; and mentions broader federal policies, now seen as racist, that killed people and shattered cultures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the resolution closes with a disclaimer: &ldquo;Nothing in this Joint Resolution authorizes any claim against the United States or serves as a settlement of any claim against the United States.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A sampling of tribal groups greeted the gesture warmly, but the groups didn&rsquo;t view it as a salve to thousands of disputes involving the government and the hundreds of tribes in the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We appreciate it. . . . It&rsquo;s a recognition of the issue, of the past injustices,&rdquo; said Steve Cadue, tribal chairman of the Kickapoo in Kansas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But others noted disputes over land, water and money and pointed out that an apology underlined with a disclaimer doesn&rsquo;t help resolve those disagreements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;An apology is just where you start,&rdquo; said Deana Jackson, a spokeswoman for The Navajo Nation. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see you step to the plate and do what you promised you would do.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She cited recent funding cuts to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service, saying they amounted to an abandonment of treaty obligations to provide for tribes&rsquo; needs in return for concessions made over generations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Congressional resolutions have been introduced to apologize for slavery but have failed. President Clinton contemplated unilaterally apologizing for slavery. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government paid reparations to Japanese Americans held in internment camps during World War II, and Congress has passed resolutions to study reparations for slavery, but payments remain controversial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brownback timed the introduction of his resolution to coincide with the September opening of the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s National Museum of the American Indian. The resolution&rsquo;s co-sponsors in the Senate are Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the only American Indian serving in Congress. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to U.S. Census figures, the American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut population is about 2.3 million, or about 0.9 percent, of the U.S. population. Census figures predict a gradual climb in that group&rsquo;s percentage of the population. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republicans and Democrats have courted tribes increasingly in recent years as some have become wealthier by running casinos. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The National Journal reports that the Agua Caliente of California, the Louisiana Coushattas, the Mississippi Choctaws and the Saginaw Chippewas of Michigan pay an average of $5 million a year to Washington lobbying firms and that those tribes have spent $2.6 million in the past six years on campaign contributions. About two-thirds of those donations went to Republicans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal Election Commission reports for Brownback show he has not received money from tribes in recent years. Rather, he has been at odds with the Wyandotte tribe, for instance, and its efforts to move graves from a Kansas City, Kan., cemetery and establish a casino there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brownback has said he has been surprised by the anger he encountered while visiting Indian reservations in Kansas. In offering his resolution, he said he hoped for healing after &ldquo;choices our government sometimes made to disregard its solemn word.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dennis Hastings, a member of the Omaha tribe from Macy, Neb., found the idea of an apology odd and inadequate. &ldquo;In a way, you look at it as nice. But it&rsquo;s a little late and too far gone,&rdquo; said Hastings, an anthropologist with Omaha Tribal Historical Research Project. &ldquo;We want to resolve the issues before they put their &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; on the board.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, tribes and their advocates tend to welcome an apology. &ldquo;These weren&rsquo;t just random or ad hoc actions of bad white people. These were the official actions of the United States government,&rdquo; said Susan Harjo, who belongs to the Cheyenne and Muscogee tribes and is president of the Morning Star Institute, a tribal advocacy group. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly in order to apologize.&rdquo;
