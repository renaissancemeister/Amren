				<a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/06/10/nimmi10.xml">Immigration &lsquo;Six Times&rsquo; More Than Official Figure</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Richard Savill, Telegraph (UK), Jun. 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration could be running at six times higher than official figures, a Home Office official told a court yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert Owen said he could not even &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; the true number of foreign nationals living in Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was giving evidence in the trial at Swansea Crown Court of three Chinese accused of people trafficking on behalf of snakehead gangs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Owen, who is seconded to the National Criminal Intelligence Service to advise on snakeheads, said there were no &ldquo;serious removal arrangements&rdquo; to send asylum seekers back to China. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of those who were rejected stayed on, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Accepted figures for people coming in are significantly higher than official figures.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Owen told the court the number of routes into Britain was &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo;. Lorry drivers were being paid up to &pound;3,000 to bring groups in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He described the trafficking as structured and sophisticated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Immigration officers take out a few shipments but we are obviously missing an awful lot of people.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boat owners in France, Holland &ldquo;and all the way up the North Sea&rdquo; were approached by snakeheads and asked to drop immigrants &ldquo;close to the shore of the UK&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of his information was &ldquo;highly classified&rdquo; but Leighton Davies, QC, prosecuting, asked him to give an overview of immigration from China. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Owen said some people were simply smuggled into the country and disappeared among Chinese communities. Others claimed asylum but vanished before the application process was exhausted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many incomers deliberately destroyed any documentation they had immediately prior to setting foot in Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Any person can arrive without documents and say, &lsquo;I want asylum&rsquo;. As soon as the magic words are said immigration have to consider it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The prosecution claim staff at the Dragon Palace Chinese takeaway in Aberystwyth acted on behalf of a snakehead gang. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Guo Chen, 34, Xing Cheng, 21, and Nualk Miah, 32, deny money laundering and assisting illegal entry into Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The trial continues.
