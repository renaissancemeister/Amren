			<p>
				<i>AFP, Yahoo! News, Jun. 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PARIS (AFP) &mdash; Former French actress Brigitte Bardot was fined 5,000 euros (6,000 dollars) by a Paris court for writing a book in which she declared disgust with her country&rsquo;s tolerance of Islam. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The judgment added to a number of previous decisions which have found the 69-year-old of provoking racial hatred in her expression of right-wing, xenophobic views. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bardot&rsquo;s publisher, Rocher, was also fined 5,000 euros for last year bringing out the book, &ldquo;Un Cri Dans le Silence&rdquo; (A Cry in the Silence). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bardot, who lives in the French Riviera town of Saint-Tropez, was not present for the verdict. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two civil rights groups, the Movement Against Racism and For Friendship Between People and the League of Human Rights, brought the lawsuit because of several passages in the book. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the most incriminating sections read: &ldquo;I am against the Islamisation of France! This obligatory allegiance, this forced submission disgusts me . . . . Our ancestors, the elderly, our grandfathers, our fathers have for centuries given their lives to push out successive invaders.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The two groups which sued the ex-actress were each awarded a symbolic one euro in damages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A complaint over a tirade in the book against &ldquo;mixing our genes&rdquo; with non-European immigrants &mdash; taken in context to mean Muslims &mdash; was not upheld. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In its verdict, the court ruled that Bardot had deliberately tried to draw a link between Islam and terrorism by mentioning the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States in a chapter on a Muslim holiday celebrated in France and elsewhere. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It found that the book argued that &ldquo;the presence of Muslims on French territory and only seem undesirable to the reader, who is ineluctably led . . . to reject members of the Muslim community through hate and violence.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				France has Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim community, estimated at five million out of a total population of 60 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In her defence, Bardot admitted in court last month that she may have been too direct in the expression of her views but she did not seek to hurt anyone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my overall view of a society becoming completely decadent, where it&rsquo;s like mediocrity has become more important than beauty and greatness, where there are more dirty, badly kept people invading the world,&rdquo; she said.
