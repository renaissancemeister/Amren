				Catholic University Stands Up to NAACP
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Susan Jones, CNSNews.com, Jun. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Catholic University in Washington, D.C., is putting its principles ahead of the NAACP&rsquo;s protests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Following a discussion with disgruntled civil rights leaders on Wednesday, Catholic University is still refusing to approve a student NAACP chapter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				School officials note that Catholic University already has two groups that defend minorities&rsquo; civil rights &mdash; but unlike the NAACP, those two groups do not support abortion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Press reports said that Catholic University&rsquo;s president, the Rev. David O&rsquo;Connell, will discuss the situation with students when they return to campus in the fall. 
			</p>
			<p>
				NAACP President and CEO Kweisi Mfume has threatened to sue Catholic University if the school does not recognize the student NAACP chapter. In a June 4 press release, Mfume called the school&rsquo;s refusal &ldquo;outright discrimination, bigotry, prejudice and intolerance all rolled into one. It is at the very least a double standard based on race and social philosophy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He (Mfume) deeply feels that the best place to resolve this question is, in his own words, in the court of law, in the court of public opinion,&rdquo; the Associated Press quoted the Rev. O&rsquo;Connell as saying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mfume says four other Catholic universities &mdash; Georgetown, Trinity College (Washington, D.C.), St. John&rsquo;s and Fordham &mdash; have NAACP college chapters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our student chapters and our members are of all races,&rdquo; Mfume said in the June 4 press release. &ldquo;The students here at Catholic University who want to organize are not Nazis, they are not thugs, they are not skinheads and they are not terrorists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are prepared to bring litigation against Catholic University for violating what we believe is the right of all students in America to free association and equal protection under the law.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The NAACP, a group that supports liberal causes and Democratic candidates, advocates keeping abortion legal.
