			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Erica Perez, iol (SA), Jun. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When you look at how many kids are doing drugs now &mdash; that&rsquo;s our future labour force. It&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s problem, it affects all of us.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the chilling assessment of John Malcolm, of the Fish Hoek Drug Crisis Centre, who has been involved in the drug culture for 28 years &mdash; as an addict, in recovery and now as a drug counsellor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The popularity of speed, a drug known as methamphetamine or &ldquo;tik&rdquo;, has exploded in the past year, making the drug problem the worst the Western Cape has ever seen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;I get up to five calls a day on various kids&rsquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have never seen anything like it,&rdquo; said Malcolm. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In some communities, you are more likely to find youngsters who are using speed than not using. Kids as young as eight and nine are methamphetamine addicts.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm said speed was cheap and readily accessible. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Internet recipes make it easy to produce. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It costs R10 a hit. A &lsquo;straw&rsquo; of speed costs anywhere from R50 to R100. The average straw gives you between five and eight hits.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re giving birth to our first generation of heroin addicts&rsquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the 90s, there were maybe four or five big drug syndicates working Wynberg and Cape Town. Now there are over 200 big drug syndicates.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm said his centre, run by just two counsellors, sees two to six families a week, and sometimes handles more than 100 calls. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chris Missing, a drug counsellor at United Christians Against Narcotics in Durbanville, agreed with Malcolm &ldquo;one hundred percent&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I started counselling just three years ago, when I&rsquo;d see on average one or two kids a day. This year I get up to five calls a day on various kids. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s grown.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In all my working time, I&rsquo;ve never worked as hard as I&rsquo;m working now. You can hardly deal with one case before the next one&rsquo;s calling you.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Methamphetamine in its many forms is a particularly dangerous drug. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We call it the Jekyl and Hyde drug because of the radical and aggressive personality changes abusers go through,&rdquo; Malcolm said. &ldquo;Families and communities are being ripped apart by it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, said Missing, many among the youth are abusing more than one drug. Many have begun to use heroin in addition to methamphetamine. The mixture causes them to become &ldquo;psychotic&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some have to be sent for psychiatric treatment in addition to rehabilitation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm said the emergence of heroin was deeply troubling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a heroin problem taking root in this country. We&rsquo;re giving birth to our first generation of heroin addicts. Once that&rsquo;s firmly entrenched, it&rsquo;s going to blow this country apart, unless we start taking steps now.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The consequences of the drug pandemic are far-reaching, Malcolm said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the crime that&rsquo;s coming off it, plus it&rsquo;s increasing the risk of HIV and Aids because of the promiscuity within the drug culture &mdash; there&rsquo;s so many things.&rdquo;
