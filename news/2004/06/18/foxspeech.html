				Fox Presses Visas, Licenses
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Immigrants deserve support, respect, Mexican president says 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Oscar Avila, Chicago Tribune, Jun. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mexican President Vicente Fox, making his second visit to Chicago as president, promised Wednesday to continue fighting for a comprehensive agreement with the United States that would make it easier for Mexican workers to get work visas and secure permanent legal status. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Coming at a crucial point in his presidency, Fox is using the high-profile, two-day stay in Chicago to heap praise on Mexicans here, saying they deserve his best efforts to improve their lives in the U.S. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Your courage, your passion, your spirit of fighting and achievement that drove you to confront a new life outside our land, that has earned our respect and admiration,&rdquo; Fox said Wednesday to about 400 Mexican-American leaders and U.S. dignitaries at the Mexican consulate on the Near West Side. &ldquo;You deserve all of our respect and recognition and support.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Later, in a meeting with news executives at the consulate, Fox said that although the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the subsequent recession created a difficult environment for a major immigration breakthrough with the U.S., eventually the United States&rsquo; need for labor would overcome those obstacles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have to put our feet on the ground and understand reality,&rdquo; the president said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get desperate. . . . We have the youth, the vision. The United States will need it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				After his seminal election in 2000 that ended seven decades of one-party rule, Fox finds himself at a crossroads in his relations with immigrants in the United States, whose economic contributions back home help prop up the Mexican economy, community leaders say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of Chicago-area residents born in Mexico approached 600,000 in 2000, more than double the 1990 total, according to the U.S. census. The Chicago area has the nation&rsquo;s second-largest Mexican community, and immigrant flows have spread to untraditional destinations such as McHenry County and Kankakee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mayor Richard Daley told Fox and the audience that immigrants represent &ldquo;a strength of our great city, the values they have given to us.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fox said the new $12 million consulate, at 204 S. Ashland Ave., is a reflection of the Mexican community&rsquo;s growth and his government&rsquo;s commitment to their needs. Mexico opened the building in February after the old facility proved unable to handle the daily crush of immigrants seeking documents and other services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Across the street from the consulate, about 125 community members expressed mixed opinions about Fox&rsquo;s track record while they struggled to catch a glimpse of the president. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some vocal protesters chastised Fox for not following up on a 2001 pledge to help undocumented children who need organ transplants. Others in the crowd waved Mexican flags and shouted words of support. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several immigrants said they were buoyed by news earlier this week that Fox would back a plan to let them cast absentee ballots in Mexican elections. Fox did not mention the plan in his speech, but his decision muted some of his critics here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He made the announcement at a very opportune time,&rdquo; said Jose Luis Gutierrez, president of a federation of Illinois residents who hail from the state of Michoacan. &ldquo;If not, the complaints would have been very strong in Chicago.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier in the day, Fox visited the University of Chicago for a lunch with top administrators. At the event, the university announced the renaming of its Mexican Studies program for Friedrich Katz, a noted scholar of Mexican history who is a Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the university. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fox also met privately with Gov. Rod Blagojevich at a downtown hotel, where the president touted a controversial proposal to grant driver&rsquo;s licenses to undocumented immigrants. Blagojevich has said he supports the idea, but Fox urged the governor to express his backing more strongly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the dedication of the consulate, Fox drew loud cheers by vowing to keep up the pressure on Illinois lawmakers to pass the twice-defeated license proposal. He also addressed critics who say granting the documents would harm national security by allowing illegal immigrants to blend into society more easily. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Mexicans are responsible people. We are honest people. We are hard-working people,&rdquo; Fox said. &ldquo;We are not going to make anyone look bad who grants us those driver&rsquo;s licenses.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wednesday night, Fox addressed the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. On Thursday, he is scheduled to speak at a Cicero school and attend a luncheon sponsored by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Fox will leave for the Detroit area Thursday afternoon, where he will meet with Gov. Jennifer Granholm and state legislators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During his 18-hour stay in Michigan, Fox will attend three separate receptions with executives from GM, Ford and Chrysler. At a luncheon Wednesday, the president of Ford Motor Co. in Mexico, Marcos de Oliveira, said auto manufacturing must remain a linchpin in the Mexican economy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several immigrants said they have a stake in Fox&rsquo;s wooing of U.S. business leaders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We want him to do something for our people there. There is so much poverty in Mexico,&rdquo; said Carolina Vasquez, 36, of Bolingbrook. &ldquo;If everything was good in Mexico, we wouldn&rsquo;t come here. We would be in our beloved country instead.&rdquo;
