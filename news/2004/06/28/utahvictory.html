			<h1>
				<a href="http://projectusa.org/ezine/2004/06-25-utah_major_victory.html">Major Victory (Really) In Utah For Immigration Realists</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>ProjectUSA, Jun. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republican primary voters in Utah&rsquo;s third congressional district handed supporters of a more moderate and democratic immigration policy a major victory Tuesday when entrenched Congressman Chris Cannon, whose support for amnesties for illegal aliens was by far the dominant issue in the race, could only manage a pathetic 58% of the vote to hold off challenger Matt Throckmorton. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By all the conventional wisdom, Throckmorton should have been shellacked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Washington lobbyists and special interests with a financial stake in immigration policy poured money into Cannon&rsquo;s campaign giving Cannon an enormous advantage in the all-important category of campaign funding. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Augmenting Cannon&rsquo;s huge cash advantage, the media establishment in Utah aggressively supported Cannon &mdash; even refusing to call Cannon on the most outrageous lies and misleading advertising. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Predictably, some in Utah are naively describing Cannon&rsquo;s poor showing as a great victory and a popular endorsement of Cannon&rsquo;s anti-borders policies. It is emphatically neither. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That the immigration issue even forced Chris Cannon into a primary in the first place is evidence that the issue is potent, but the fact that there was only a 16 percent difference between Throckmorton and Cannon when the voting was over is really a huge indictment of Cannon, as the people who watch such things will be well aware. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Political scientists define a primary race in which the winning margin is less than 20 percent as a competitive race. According to an April 2000 study (out of Brigham Young University, ironically), only 1.2 percent of incumbent primaries in non-redistricting years are competitive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By coming within 16 percent, Matt Throckmorton took on the incumbent, the financial power of the corporate interests, and a shamelessly hostile local media, and, on the power of the immigration issue, brought Chris Cannon, statistically speaking, to his knees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While a loss is never easy, Matt Throckmorton should remember that he fought an honorable fight against nearly impossible odds, and made a spectacular showing in the face of American politics at its ugliest. At 36, his political future is very bright. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, immigration moderates should know that in Washington, the real target of our work in Utah, Tuesday&rsquo;s results will be seen for what they are: a major win. And the game is far from over. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>+== TAKE POSITIVE ACTION ==+</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the events in Utah, it is no wonder the Bush White House has distanced itself from Cannon and his irresponsible and unpopular amnesty schemes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now there are reports from Utah that Cannon is so unpopular he is driving people &mdash; large numbers of people &mdash; away from the Republican Party. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, we&rsquo;ve been asking you to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) and let it know how you and the overwhelming majority of Americans feel about Chris Cannon and politicians like him (one supporter reports being told when he called that the RNC has never had so many complaints on anything else). 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s essential the RNC really gets the message. Please call the chairman of the RNC, Ed Gillespie, and leave a message letting him know what you think about Chris Cannon. In particular, Mr. Gillespie needs to know that Cannon and his amnesties are driving voters away from the Republican Party.

				<b>+== QUOTE OF THE WEEK ==+</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Cannon&rsquo;s an incumbent, was challenged in the convention with a primary and he didn&rsquo;t get more than 60 percent. Clearly people are ready for some change.&rdquo;

			</p>
			<p>
				For the first time in over a decade I am forced to realistically consider voting for a Democrat in November. Not only does Chris Cannon not represent Republican ideals, he doesn&rsquo;t even represent America&rsquo;s best interest as far as I can tell.
