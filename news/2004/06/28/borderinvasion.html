			<h1>
				Anderson Examines Devastating Impact of Invasion, Life on the Border
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Dennis Durband, Arizona Conservative, June</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the interior of Mexico, there is a labor shortage. There are no Americans available to do the jobs that Mexicans won&rsquo;t do. However, the travel industry is thriving. And these are great days for &ldquo;coyotes&rdquo; &mdash; human smugglers &mdash; and those in drug trafficking. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Travelers from South and Central America, Mexico and other nations are traveling in great numbers up through Hermosillo, Mexico and to northern staging locations near the U.S. border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These people can go to a Catholic church in one of the Mexican towns along the way to read hand-drawn diagrams of routes into the United States, along with a list of demands and rights to claim once they reach the U.S., all posted on a wall inside the sanctuary. People are advised to draw attention to themselves in front of the American media. Father Rene has developed a convenient cottage industry &mdash; a &ldquo;migrant center&rdquo; aside the church. He sells backpacks and supplies for those aiming to enter the U.S. illegally. &ldquo;Migrants&rdquo; can also buy U.S. sports caps and shirts to help them blend in and look American north of the border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Erin Anderson, a native of Cochise County who now works in Washington, D.C., has examined several staging areas in Mexico. An expert on the subject of the border invasion, Anderson explained &ldquo;Life on the Border&rdquo; to an audience of conservatives attending the recent Arizona Republican Assembly state convention in Phoenix. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Anderson explained that those smuggling drugs and humans are collaborating and using the same networks. The entire route is mechanized, from southern Mexico and Central America, and can be traveled in as little as 72 hours. The only walking required is at the American border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The Mexican government is in this up to their eyeballs,&rdquo; Anderson said. &ldquo;Hermosillo is a big originating site. Airlines are always full with illegals. The 300-seat airbuses are always full. A ticket costs $215. A shuttle bus fleet awaits the passengers. There are four companies and their buses are color-coded. The buses only go north. Ciudad has a labor union, and there are not enough workers are available there. The &lsquo;industry&rsquo; towns are in the north. The main industry is moving migrants north. Altar is &lsquo;coyoteville.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wave upon wave of people move northward toward the Tucson sector. The Immigration and Naturalization Service posts just 6-12 agents on duty each night to deal with the overwhelming surge of humanity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s claim to put more assets on the border is a lie,&rdquo; Anderson said. &ldquo;We have lost more than 100 border agents, who have quit. Homeland Security is broke. On one ranch, every family member has been ambushed by illegals. Obstacles are placed on the highway to stop cars. School buses require a sheriff&rsquo;s escort for safety. If you want to see grown men cry, talk to rangers and ranchers. We can endure drought, but no one can endure the constant onslaught of illegals.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Illegals trash the Arizona landscape. Cattle and wildlife die from eating the plastic bags left behind by the invaders. Illegals break off water spigots and drain water tanks. National parks along the border are being trampled to death. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In his book, &ldquo;Death of the West,&rdquo; Pat Buchanan wrote about his visit with Theresa Murray, an 82-year-old southern Arizona rancher living in a home which had been burglarized 30 times by invaders, despite having bars over all the doors and windows. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Buchanan wrote: &ldquo;Theresa Murray is living out her life inside a maximum-security prison, in her own home, in her own country, because her government lacks the moral courage to do its duty and defend the borders of the United States of America.&rdquo; Murray called her life, &ldquo;plain old hell.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				After President George Bush announced his Temporary Worker plan in January, the border invasion worsened significantly: more than 140 percent for OTMs &mdash; Other Than Mexican. The number of invading SIAs &mdash; special interest aliens &mdash; skyrocketed, too. The numbers are deliberately low-balled by Homeland Security, Anderson says. One in five are apprehended, they say, but it is more likely one in 10. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once in Tucson, invaders are home free. Then it becomes much easier to make it to Phoenix and take a flight to Los Angeles or disperse to other American locations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Matricula Consular card booklets are available at numerous banks and credit unions, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America. There is no way of verifying the identities on the cards, and many aliens have several &mdash; each with a different ID. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is money in the cards,&rdquo; Anderson says. &ldquo;If you want to hide from the IRS, get an MC card. MC cards allow illegals to wire funds. It is a multi-billion dollar industry. There are Western Union billboards near the borders to get the interest of illegals. Western Union was fined $8 million in New York for money laundering and reporting irregularities. Their market share dropped about 50 percent. Western Union started a $10 million marketing campaign in favor of the Bush Temporary Worker program. A credit union received a $10 million grant to expand personal loans to coyotes. The Mexican government does not recognize the MC cards. They use another card because they are concerned about voter fraud.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Phoenix stash houses, illegals are held for ransom. Home invasions in Arizona have increased exponentially in recent years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				El Salvadoran guerrillas have moved into the U.S. and evolved into street gangs in several states, Anderson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They are a vicious, brutal gang and well armed,&rdquo; Anderson said. &ldquo;The Mexican Mafia is in our prisons. Witnesses are being murdered. Chuck Colson alerted me to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in our prisons. Vegas and LA have the 18<sup>th</sup> Street Gang.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				All the while, the U.S. government refuses to recognize the 500-pound gorilla in the national &ldquo;living room.&rdquo; However, taxpayers in Arizona and elsewhere continue to be gouged by the financial, social, cultural and criminal impact of the invasion.
