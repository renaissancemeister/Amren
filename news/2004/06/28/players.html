				It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Player&rsquo; Who Gets The Girl (Or Girls), and a Rep That&rsquo;s Good and Bad 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Laura Sessions Stepp, Washington Post, Jun. 28</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once, a while back, every high school had a few &mdash; the bad boys, the sexy, perpetually unhappy James Deans of the 20th century. They were accompanied by motorcycles and Camel cigarettes and a lot of girls saying that, despite the arrest for stealing hubcaps, they were actually sensitive or intelligent. A lot of girls did not say that bad boys were attractive because they were dangerous, exciting, sexy and a once-in-a-lifetime chance to escape the Mom-and-Dad proprieties of teenage life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now there are fewer proprieties and more bad boys taking media-glorified rogues as their models: rappers, professional snowboarders, actors, or athletes who flaunt their roguery. In high schools, the outsiders are now the insiders: Boys who attract lots of girls, and treat them badly, aren&rsquo;t called bad anymore. They&rsquo;re called players. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Same old game, but less blame and a brand-new name. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Player&rdquo; is a label that kids instantly recognize as belonging to someone who prefers sports jerseys to leather jackets, who charms rather than alarms adults and resembles a bad boy in one significant way: attracting all kinds of girls who should know better. 
			</p>
