				Detroit Contractors Must Tell Slave Past
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Ordinance requires full disclosure, but will not ban any from city jobs 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Natalie Y. Moore, The Detroit News, Jun. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				DETROIT &mdash; The Detroit City Council has passed a largely symbolic ordinance that would require contractors who want to do business with the city to disclose whether their companies profited from slavery. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chicago, Los Angeles and Wayne County have enacted similar laws. Detroit&rsquo;s ordinance says contractors must search their backgrounds, and then sign an affidavit divulging investments and income from the slave industry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It has been quite a long time since African-Americans were promised 40 acres and a mule. This ordinance only provides for the beginning of that process by requiring full disclosure,&rdquo; said Barbara-Rose Collins, sponsor of the ordinance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Companies with slave ties would not be banned from city contracts, but any with a falsified slave history would have contracts voided. The ordinance will take effect within seven days. Councilwoman JoAnn Watson has said that volunteer lawyers are committed to researching companies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics say only a few companies that earned money from slavery still exist and that the measure creates more red tape for businesses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wednesday&rsquo;s vote on the ordinance was unanimous with Kenneth Cockrel Jr. not present. Despite her affirmative vote, Councilwoman Kay Everett had previously expressed concern about the ordinance&rsquo;s purpose. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have so much more important things to do. Our focus should not just be on our racial issues,&rdquo; Everett said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Elder Eykkeo&rsquo;, 65, of Detroit said this ordinance moves blacks a step closer to receiving reparations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I support my ancestors. There&rsquo;s accountability involved in this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our ancestors have been crying for this resolution for many centuries.&rdquo;
