			<h1>
				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3383875.stm">Kilroy-Silk: MP To Talk Show Host</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Jun. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>After 17 years of debating with the public on his morning chat show, you could argue that Robert Kilroy-Silk never really left politics. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				His election as an MEP in the East Midlands takes the silver-haired 61-year-old back to the career he left to become a household name. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Born in Birmingham, Mr Kilroy-Silk was educated at the London School of Economics and worked as a university lecturer before becoming a Labour MP. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He represented Ormskirk in Lancashire from 1974. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He later left claiming the local Labour party had been overtaken by the Militant Tendency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He opted for safe Labour seat Knowsley North following the 1983 boundary review and served on Labour&rsquo;s frontbench as a home affairs spokesman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But three years later he quit to host the BBC&rsquo;s Kilroy show. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Arab comments </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Kilroy-Silk has insisted he has no regrets about abandoning the serious work of politics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He once said the BBC expected him to do Newsnight or Question Time, but that he found Kilroy &ldquo;more interesting and it paid more&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a career that saw him brush with controversy on more than one occasion, most famously in his Sunday Express column describing Arabs as &ldquo;suicide bombers, limb-amputators, women repressors&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While he insisted he was a right to express his views and claimed to have widespread public support, the comments saw his show axed and him leave the BBC. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The row was not the first time the TV host has been accused of racism or xenophobia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He has attracted criticism for comments about asylum seekers and Irish people. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Victim entertainment&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The presenter&rsquo;s show fell foul of TV watchdogs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1998 it was rapped by the British Standards Commission for a scene in which a guest exposed himself on live TV. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The BBC said the programme team had been &ldquo;taken by surprise&rdquo; by the incident, which prompted five complaints from viewers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless the corporation apologised to the BSC over the incident. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In another run-in with the BSC, Mr Kilroy-Silk said the BSC&rsquo;s &pound;2m budget would be better spent on the NHS. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This time, he was responding to criticism of the Kilroy show, which the BSC had branded &ldquo;victim entertainment&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The presenter, who hosted the show for 17 years, said the organisation&rsquo;s budget could be spent on &ldquo;630 hip operations or 345 heart bypass operations&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He denounced the BSC&rsquo;s attitude as &ldquo;patronising&rdquo; to his guests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Further ambitions </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Married with two children, Mr Kilroy-Silk&rsquo;s personal life has also hit the headlines at times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1990 his son Dominic was sent to Ford open prison for 10 months after pleading guilty to a &pound;350,000 mortgage fraud. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And five years later it was reported he had a secret love child conceived when he was an MP. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But his return to the political fray again shows he has no desire for a quiet life. He even declared: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do humble.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He says he will consider taking over the UKIP leadership and standing to be an MP in Westminster. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His election campaign saw him quoted as saying he would spend little time at the European Parliament if elected. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If he does attend, he is unlikely to hold back when voicing his Eurosceptic beliefs, promising to get Britain &ldquo;back from Brussels&rdquo;.
