			<h1>
				Court: Whites Should Not Face More Obstacles In Race Discrimination Suits
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Detroit Free Press, Jun. 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LANSING, Mich. (AP) &mdash; A white officer who said the Battle Creek Police Department racially discriminated against him should not have a tougher time proving his case in court than a minority employee, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Friday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a 5-2 decision, the court struck down a legal standard that distinguishes between plaintiffs on the basis of race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawsuit was filed by Michael Lind, a white officer who alleged reverse discrimination occurred when the Battle Creek Police Department promoted a black officer who scored lower on written and oral exams than Lind. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The trial court and Michigan Court of Appeals ruled against Lind, who now works as an assistant prosecutor for Calhoun County. Michigan&rsquo;s lower courts had used a legal test that required a person claiming reverse discrimination to prove that the employer has an unusual background of discriminating against majority groups. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the state&rsquo;s highest court overturned those decisions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Michigan Civil Rights Act &ldquo;draws no distinction between individual plaintiffs on account of race,&rdquo; Justice Stephen Markman wrote for the majority. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The decision pleased Lind&rsquo;s attorney, Marshall Grate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We all ought to stand equally before the law,&rdquo; Grate said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the court&rsquo;s decision drew sharp rebukes from dissenting Justices Michael Cavanagh and Marilyn Kelly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In our society, demeaning acts of prejudice directed against whites because of their race are uncommon,&rdquo; Kelly wrote in arguing that distinctions based on race are justified. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Robert Young, the court&rsquo;s lone black justice, questioned what he called the dissenters&rsquo; &ldquo;Orwellian racial policy preferences&rdquo; and argued that no citizen should be more equal than another. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The court returned Lind&rsquo;s case to the trial court for reconsideration. His case had been dismissed by the circuit court. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Glen Lenhoff, a Flint employment discrimination expert, said the ruling could pave the way for challenges in state courts to the University of Michigan law school&rsquo;s admissions policy, which allows race to be considered under limited circumstances. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the university&rsquo;s undergraduate admissions policy that awarded points to racial minorities, but allowed the law school&rsquo;s more subjective admissions policy to stand. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lenhoff called the ruling the Michigan Supreme Court&rsquo;s most &ldquo;socially significant&rdquo; in years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The Michigan judiciary has made it crystal clear that it will not allow reverse discrimination,&rdquo; Lenhoff said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how (the court) could allow reverse discrimination in college admissions after this opinion.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While Lind&rsquo;s case deals specifically with hiring practices, Lenhoff said the ruling could be brought to bear on higher education because the Michigan Civil Rights Act also affects universities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lind brought the suit after unsuccessfully seeking a promotion to sergeant in 1996. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city&rsquo;s collective bargaining agreement says that, when a position opens, the city can select any one of its top five candidates. Lind ranked second based on oral and written exams and seniority. The department hired Arthur McClenney, a black patrol officer who ranked fifth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				City Attorney Clyde Robinson said Friday that former Police Chief Tom Pope hired McClenney because he liked his &ldquo;maturity and sense of duty to the department.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lind &ldquo;came across with the attitude that he felt the position was owed to him,&rdquo; Robinson said. He added that an Asian-American had ranked first, but also didn&rsquo;t get the promotion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lind could not be reached for comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city is disappointed that the justices got rid of the old standard without putting a new one in its place, Robinson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What are you putting in place? Give us some guidance,&rdquo; he said.
