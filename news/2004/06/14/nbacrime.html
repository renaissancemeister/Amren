				NBA: That&rsquo;s A Crime!
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Dareh Gregorian, N. Y. Post, Jun. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The NBA is rapidly turning into a national criminals&rsquo; association: A whopping 40 percent of NBA players have police records, a bombshell new book charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book by investigative reporter Jeff Benedict, &ldquo;Out of Bounds: Inside the NBA&rsquo;s Culture of Rape, Violence &amp; Crime&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t supposed to hit bookstores until later this week, but The Post located a copy that went on sale earlier. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In it, Benedict finds that 40 percent of the American players in the NBA during the 2001-02 season had police records involving a serious crime. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a situation that is out of control and absolutely demands close scrutiny,&rdquo; Benedict writes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book is almost a &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who in the NBA,&rdquo; and recounts legal scrapes involving everyone from Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, Patrick Ewing, Penny Hardway, Allen Iverson and Bonzi Wells to Ruben Patterson, Glenn Robinson and Damon Stoudamire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book notes that the problems with the law aren&rsquo;t a distant memory for many players. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as All-Star Kobe Bryant was being charged with sexually assaulting a Colorado woman, &ldquo;25 law enforcement agencies in 13 cities in the United States and Canada were simultaneously proceeding with arrest warrants, indictments, plea-agreement proceedings or trials involving more than a dozen other NBA players,&rdquo; the book says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the player crimes involve violence against women, Benedict found. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His nationwide search, which focused on American players, turned up &ldquo;33 criminal complaints of domestic violence against NBA players who played during the 2001-2002 season,&rdquo; a figure he said &ldquo;is probably the tip of the iceberg&rdquo; because &ldquo;nationally, domestic violence compares with child abuse and rape as the most underreported crime in our society.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sixteen of those 33 cases ended in conviction. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of the sexual abuse cases simply evaporate.

			<p>
				Benedict recounts one case in which former Knick Anthony Mason was questioned about an alleged rape in New Jersey in 2001. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rape complaint was the third lodged against the Miami Heat player in three years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The first two allegations were later dropped. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the New Jersey incident, a woman claimed Mason forced himself on her after inviting her to his hotel, then had two of his buddies join in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Why the [heck] would I ask you to come out here if I just wanted to talk to you?&rdquo; she quoted Mason as saying in the police report. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prosecutors believed the woman&rsquo;s claims and were set to move forward with the case when the woman suddenly moved to another state and stopped cooperating with them, the book says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Benedict writes that another alleged victim of a crime who vanished was Kim Grant, who accused O&rsquo;Neal of grabbing her by the neck during a brief run-in in Orlando. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The case eventually was dropped after O&rsquo;Neal hired a high-powered attorney who managed to stall the probe, the book says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Frustrated, Grant then contemplated a lawsuit, but &ldquo;virtually disappeared,&rdquo; the book says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s unclear if there was some kind of financial deal or if Grant just gave up the fight. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book says that though most player incidents involve crimes against women, documents show &ldquo;police officers are their second most common group of victims.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book cited a 1990 incident inolving then-rookie Cliff Robinson of the Portland Trail Blazers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When police responded to a call to a fight at a Portland restaurant, an enraged Robinson was chasing a man he&rsquo;d gotten into a fracas with. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The man ran up to a female police officer, Elaine Sloan, for help. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Undeterred, Robinson struck the cop &ldquo;in the side of the head with such force that Sloan dropped to the ground and was later treated at a nearby hospital for injuries.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				When more police arrived and arrested Robinson, Sloan read Robinson his rights. &ldquo;He mimicked her the entire time,&rdquo; the book says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When Robinson was issued four citations for assault and disorderly conduct at the police station, he told Sloan, &ldquo;If I had known you were giving me all these tickets . . . I would have made the hit worthwhile.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Robinson later pleaded guilty to assault and was ordered to undergo anger-management counseling, the book says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book points at the youth, wealth and life of privilege of many of the players as the reason for their authority issues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;For many players, encounters with law-enforcement officials represent the rare instance of someone telling them no,&rdquo; Benedict writes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Judging by the way players react when confronted by a police officer, it is no wonder why women who tell them no end up being abused.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The HarperCollins book isn&rsquo;t Benedict&rsquo;s first major expose. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL&rdquo; shocked with the revelation that 21 percent of NFL players had been arrested for serious crimes.
