				European elections 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>The Guardian (UK), Jun. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The forecast that Labour would get clobbered in the locals and the Tories in the Europeans always looked too glibly symmetrical to be true. Last night it was in tatters, as the UK Independence party led the way in rewriting the electoral scorebook in the European elections and, in so doing, left the politics of this country&rsquo;s relationship with Europe as uncertain as at any time since Labour took office. Ukip took lumps out of all the parties but the biggest casualty was the cause of Britain in Europe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ukip has achieved a spectacular irruption into the existing electoral order. The party did not come from absolutely nowhere &mdash; it took 7% in the last European elections in 1999 &mdash; and neither was it the only winner last night. The Liberal Democrats gained some ground, the Greens held their own and other small parties picked up votes. But Ukip matched them with a surge at least as powerful as the Green party&rsquo;s 15% score in the 1989 Europeans. Ukip&rsquo;s success has much bigger political consequences too. Proportional representation means that Ukip&rsquo;s vote has been rewarded with a harvest of seats from the Scilly Isles to Newcastle; under first past the post in 1989 the Greens got no MEPs at all. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The other big difference compared with 1989 is that, compared with recent opinion polls, support for the two major parties has been knocked back to levels that would horrify them at a general election. Labour and the Conservatives both took around a quarter of the vote. The Liberal Democrats, who have a bad record in European elections, put up their share of the vote slightly but were still adrift neck and neck with Ukip. That all adds up to an election with a series of striking legacies for the record books: the first election in which the two major parties struggled to win a majority of votes; the first in which parties not represented in the House of Commons took more than 25% of the total; and the first election in British history in which the &ldquo;winning&rdquo; party got less than a third of the votes. These results will not have made many converts to the campaign for proportional representation at Westminster. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Ukip represents something new in British politics in its own right. Though it undoubtedly owes its success to its simplistic anti-European message in a European parliamentary election, Ukip&rsquo;s significance is wider. Europe may be Ukip&rsquo;s preoccupation, but the party is recognisably also a characteristic populist party of the right, anti-immigrant, anti-politician and anti-metropolitan (and with a charismatic figurehead). Parties of this kind are familiar in many political cultures, from France and Italy to the United States and Australia. This is the first time such a party has made such an impact in a UK election. It is a big hit against the European cause but, as results from elsewhere in the EU showed last night, it paradoxically leaves British politics looking more typically European. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ukip should neither be overestimated nor underestimated. Its success may be a flash in the pan in general election terms, as the Greens&rsquo; was 15 years ago. European elections often produce protest party successes, and the political conditions this time were perfect for such a result. But don&rsquo;t be too confident that Ukip&rsquo;s fine showing is ephemeral. Last night will give Ukip significant rights to be heard on the BBC from now on, especially when, with a referendum looming, Europe is set to remain so high profile. This could help encourage rich anti-Europeans to bankroll the party at a general election that is probably less than a year away. That could make Ukip a more significant spoiler for Tory votes in 2005 than the Referendum party was in 1997. The disruptive effect in the Tory party could be explosive. But Ukip will frighten a weakened Labour too. These results have a price for all parties, and for the pro-European cause most of all.
