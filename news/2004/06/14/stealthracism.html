				<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,11374,1238608,00.html">Report Claims Police &lsquo;Stealth Racism&rsquo;</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Press Association, Guardian, Jun. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Diversity training for police officers may have driven discrimination underground and created a new breed of &ldquo;stealth racist&rdquo;, an official report said today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An interim study by the Commission For Racial Equality (CRE) produced evidence that many officers treated race and diversity awareness as &ldquo;a big joke&rdquo; and that black and Asian recruits were excluded from a dominant culture of heavy drinking. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It also uncovered a &ldquo;disturbing racial pattern&rdquo; in recruitment which saw more black and Asian than white candidates rejected on race and diversity grounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Home Office data showed 42% of Chinese applicants to the police were rejected on the grounds of &ldquo;respect for race and diversity&rdquo;. Similarly, 34% of black and 33% of Asian applicants were rejected, compared with 23% of their white counterparts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report, headed by former director of public prosecutions Sir David Calvert-Smith QC, said: &ldquo;The precise reasons for this disturbing racial pattern need to be determined, and the assessment methods and scoring systems examined more closely.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In initial evidence gathered by the CRE, some ethnic minority recruits spoke of a dominant bar culture which they felt &ldquo;reinforced macho and anti-diversity attitudes&rdquo;, particularly excluding teetotallers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;One informant suggested that the training was helping to create a new phenomenon, the &lsquo;stealth racist&rsquo;, who learned how to remain undetected by the emphasis on what terminology to use and not use. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;One Asian Muslim officer had usually been the one left without a partner when the odd-numbered and otherwise all-white class split into pairs, and had had curry splashed on his bedroom door,&rdquo; said the report. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One trainee reported an instructor at a police training college telling the class: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done the diversity. That&rsquo;s a load of balls. Now let&rsquo;s get on with the real stuff.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was also reported that many police officers did not understand the term &ldquo;institutional racism&rdquo;, as defined by the Macpherson report into the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, the CRE investigated one officer who claimed never to have heard of the Lawrence report. &ldquo;Evidence taken from these groups and individuals suggests that many trainers were unconfident, uncommitted or even hostile to diversity,&rdquo; it added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Institutional racism remained widely misunderstood after the training, and was seen as a smear on the police service which was resented and so constrained the effectiveness of further training.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This evidence also suggested that training managers had only paid &ldquo;lip service&rdquo; to diversity, the report said.
