			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>ProjectUSA, Jun. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The audio recording of Chris Cannon&rsquo;s appearance on a Spanish language radio station in Salt Lake City continues to cause upheaval in the GOP primary race in Utah&rsquo;s 3rd congressional district. Having just weathered national news coverage of Cannon&rsquo;s solicitation of illegal aliens for campaign contributions, beleaguered Cannon constituents are faced with more embarrassment, as attention shifts to other damaging portions of the recording. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The audio recording shows Cannon explicitly racializes the immigration issue, telling listeners his opponents are &ldquo;against Hispanics.&rdquo; He also seems to condone voter fraud by responding &ldquo;okay&rdquo; when the program&rsquo;s host encourages illegal aliens in the audience to register to vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				[Click <a href="https://projectusa.org/state/UT/03/04-06-18-cannon_voter_fraud.html">here</a> for a transcript of the shocking racial venom, illegality, divisiveness, and dirty politics that run throughout this appearance.] 
			</p>
			<p>
				Naturally, the encouragement of illegal aliens to register to vote caught our attention, and we decided to investigate further. We quickly came into contact with someone with direct knowledge of the participation by Cannon staffer Marcos Diaz in voter registration campaigns during which people were registered to vote without regard to their immigration status. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Thursday, I passed this information on to a Salt Lake City reporter, telling her that, given this eyewitness account of voter fraud, we were going to examine the voter registration roles in areas with high concentrations of foreign-born residents, and see whether we could spot any unusual patterns that could be tied to a voter drive in which Marco Diaz was involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If there were anything in the voter rolls that indicated voter fraud, I explained to the reporter, an exceptionally large and otherwise unexplainable bump in registrations in a single day, for example, ProjectUSA would challenge those names under a process permitted by Utah law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Friday, the newspaper printed our intent to challenge suspect registrations (without mentioning the eyewitness account of the Marco Diaz shenanigans). 
			</p>
			<p>
				By midday, the race-identity crowd was in an uproar. Sylvia Haro, a member of the Latino legislative task force, who once told the <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> &ldquo;we are Hispanic first,&rdquo; used the opportunity to accuse Cannon&rsquo;s opponent, Matt Throckmorton, of racism (801 301-0408, <a href="mailto:s.haro@utah.edu">s.haro@utah.edu</a>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				By the end of the day, Utah&rsquo;s Attorney General Mark Shurtleff (<a href="mailto:uag@utah.gov">uag@utah.gov</a>) had issued a statement calling our effort to ensure our voting laws weren&rsquo;t being abused a clear case of voter intimidation, and, if you can believe it, the U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division had issued a press release saying it was going to send election observers to Utah to monitor Tuesday&rsquo;s primary vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, a sitting U.S. Congressman and his staff can go on a radio program on which voter fraud is openly encouraged (in Utah, a class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2500 fine) and we don&rsquo;t hear a peep from the Utah Attorney General or the U.S. Department of Justice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But let ProjectUSA say we will examine publicly available records to see whether we can spot evidence of the illegal activity the Congressman condoned, and, if we find any, legally challenge suspect registrations, and the state and federal agencies responsible for law enforcement spring into action &mdash; <i>against us!</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our country needs to get a grip. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>+== TAKE POSITIVE ACTION ==+</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				During his appearance on the racially divisive radio program that has gotten him national attention, Chris Cannon told the audience that his opponents are against Hispanics and that a vote for him is a vote for immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Call Cannon&rsquo;s campaign today and let them know what you think of a sitting U.S. Congressman explicitly racializing the immigration issue and turning immigration into a tussle between the races.

				&ldquo;But I would say that for the Hispanics, hear me well, for the Hispanics the good side is the side of Mr. Cannon&rsquo;s. For . . . those that do not . . . for those that . . . for the Hispanics the bad side is Mr. Trockmorton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
