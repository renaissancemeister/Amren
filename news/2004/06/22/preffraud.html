			<h1>
				Businessman Accused of Minority Contract Fraud
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Shamus Toomey, Chicago Sun-Times, Jun. 17 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Country Club Hills window installer thought he was living a dream when his boss helped him start his own company. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But prosecutors claim he was really getting duped, unknowingly set up as a front for his white boss, who needed minority subcontractors to win a $6 million contract to replace aluminum windows at Chicago public schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The boss, Joseph Doyle, 48, of Oak Lawn, and his accountant, Mary Cavanaugh, 60, of Evergreen Park, were charged with mail fraud in the alleged scam Wednesday, nearly six years after the contract was awarded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But attorneys for Doyle and Cavanaugh say no law was broken, and there was no victim because all of the window work was done. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You try to help an African-American guy out, you help set him up a business, you give him the contracts &mdash; where&rsquo;s the scam?&rdquo; Doyle attorney Mike Coffield said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But federal prosecutor Valarie Hays said that, despite claims made in documents, the window installer had no stake in Quality Window Installation, no say in its management and received just $12,000 of the $595,360 paid to it by Doyle&rsquo;s parent firm, Tru-Lite Window Co. of Alsip. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The unnamed installer blew the whistle after repeatedly asking Doyle when he would get to actually run the company and was fired, said Nancy Laureto, associate general counsel for the Chicago Public Schools, which turned the case over to the feds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Doyle &ldquo;offered him this deal, and the guy was thrilled,&rdquo; Laureto said. &ldquo;He thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have my own business &mdash; my dream come true.&rsquo; After he was laid off, he thought, &lsquo;How could I be fired? This is my own company.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s when he knew something was wrong, and he got a lawyer.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffield said the installer wasn&rsquo;t fired &mdash; he quit after a lag in payments from Tru-Lite. Prosecutors disputed that claim. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Quality Window is the latest firm to be accused of being run by someone other than the minorities or women listed on its records. City Hall in recent months has stripped several companies of woman- or minority-owned status as part of the Hired Truck scandal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prosecutors say the latest scam began after Tru-Lite was awarded an $11 million window contract from the public schools in 1996. To renew the contract in 1998, Doyle substituted his legitimate black-owned subcontractor with Quality Windows, prosecutors said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city certified Quality Window as black-owned in 1998 after Cavanaugh filled out forms claiming the installer owned and ran it, prosecutors said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Doyle was really in charge, though, while the installer continued his regular job at an increased hourly rate, Hays said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When the installer was fired, Doyle and Cavanaugh continued to pay employees with Quality Window checks by using a stamp with the installer&rsquo;s signature, prosecutors said. After the installer went to the school board, school officials barred Tru-Lite in 2001 from doing school business for three years, Laureto said.
