				<a href="https://www.jewishworldreview.com/0604/nemko1.asp">We Already Send Too Many Students To College</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Marty Nemko, Jewish World Review, Jun. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				We already send too many students to college. Among the bottom quarter (below 2.6 high school GPA and 850 SAT), only 20% graduate, even if they&rsquo;re given six years! 
			</p>
			<p>
				And John Kerry wants to dig deeper into the barrel and send 1.5 million more to college? 
			</p>
			<p>
				And among those in the bottom quarter who defy the odds and do graduate, they&rsquo;re rarely at the top of their class. So, with today&rsquo;s oversupply of degree holders, they must often settle for a job they could have gotten without college. Don&rsquo;t you know many degreed people who have non-professional jobs? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colleges trumpet the statistic that college graduates earn more over their lifetime, but that doesn&rsquo;t apply to the bottom quarter. They would likely earn more if they chose one of the post-high-school options I&rsquo;ll suggest below. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, college isn&rsquo;t just about career preparation. As colleges ever remind us, it&rsquo;s about enhancing the life of the mind. Unfortunately, the bottom quarter (and many other students) don&rsquo;t experience such loftiness. Too often, they&rsquo;re bored by professors&rsquo; arcana and confused by their theories. And then there&rsquo;s calculus. What the bottom quarter typically does receive is an ongoing assault to self-esteem and a lot of student debt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m particularly concerned about colleges&rsquo; non-disclosure of the above to low-achieving minority students. In colleges&rsquo; eagerness to diversify, they admit, indeed woo, minorities with poor high school records. Doing that is a bit like the Tuskegee medical experiments in which African-Americans were exposed to dangerous treatment without informed consent. Of course, the college treatment won&rsquo;t kill them; it will just decrease their chances of success and happiness. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And Kerry wants to send 1.5 million more to college? 
			</p>
			<p>
				If my child had bottom-quartile high school grades and SAT score, I&rsquo;d suggest he or she consider a Small Business Administration program on how to start a business, or courses on how to become an effective yet ethical salesperson. If my child preferred a hands-on career, I&rsquo;d encourage an apprenticeship or military stint to become, for example, an electrician or surveyor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If I were president, I&rsquo;d fund more apprenticeship programs and cut funding to colleges that admit students who&rsquo;d be better off in a non-college alternative. I sure wouldn&rsquo;t send 1.5 million more to college.
