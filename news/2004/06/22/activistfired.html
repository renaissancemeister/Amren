				Police Advisory Board Ousting Latina Activist
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Yvonne Wingett, Arizona Republic, Jun. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Latina activist is being forced out of her post with a board that advises Phoenix Police Department on Hispanic policies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hispanic Advisory Board is sending a letter to Lizabeth Ramon de Harvey informing her that she is no longer a member of the volunteer board after she pleaded guilty in April to aiding and abetting illegal entry of two undocumented Hispanic brothers at the U.S.-Mexican border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ra&uacute;l S&aacute;nchez Monreal Jr., the board chairman, said he gave Ramon de Harvey an opportunity to resign before sending the letter this week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I wanted to give Liza time to reflect what she did, and the impact she had on the committee by what she did,&rdquo; said Monreal, director of South Mountain Community College Guadalupe Center. &ldquo;Liza decided not to resign. I&rsquo;m sending her a certified letter telling her we are terminating her.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ramon de Harvey, the girlfriend of Assistant Police Chief Silverio Ontiveros, was not available for comment Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She admitted to breaking U.S. and federal laws,&rdquo; said S&aacute;nchez Monreal. &ldquo;We do feel very strongly that if we&rsquo;re going to hold the police department to abide and follow the law, that we cannot in good standing keep a member who&rsquo;s not in good standing.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Upset about a March 28 incident in which juveniles and young adults were sent back to Mexico because they could not prove they were living here legally, Ramon de Harvey tried to bring two back. She was caught April 15 trying to smuggle them across the border in the trunk of her car, officials have said. Under a plea agreement, she avoided jail time, fines and community service. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Phoenix police, meanwhile, are investigating whether Ontiveros had any role in the incident. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some board members said her actions could undermine efforts of the board and reflect it in a bad light. The 16-member panel advises Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris and police departments on policies affecting the Latino community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We just felt that we have different set of standards on the advisory board,&rdquo; said Julian Claudio Nabozny, the board&rsquo;s co-chair. &ldquo;One of the standards . . . is that we do not want members to have a record.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				S&aacute;nchez Monreal, who delivered the news to Ramon de Harvey on Wednesday afternoon, said a majority of the members voted by e-mail to give her an opportunity to resign. If she didn&rsquo;t, he said, they would terminate her.
