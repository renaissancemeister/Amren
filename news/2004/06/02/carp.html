			<h1>
				Calif. Bill Would Allow &ldquo;Consideration&rdquo; of Race
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>John Rosenberg, Discriminations, May 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Wednesday the California state assembly passed a bill, by a vote of 45-30 with no debate, that would allow the University of California and California State University systems to consider race in admissions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But, you must be wondering, as I did, wouldn&rsquo;t such a law kick sand in the face of Prop. 209, which bans the consideration of race? Good question, but Ricardo Lara, communications director for Marco Firebaugh, principal [not &ldquo;principle,&rdquo; as originally mis-typed!] author of the bill, says no. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lara said the bill does not violate Proposition 209 because it &ldquo;does not allow for any preferential treatment,&rdquo; and merely advocates the consideration of more than academic factors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What is the point of considering something that can&rsquo;t be used? In fact, if racial information cannot be used to influence admission decisions, what exactly would &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; of it entail? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Discriminating minds want to know, and so we turn to Rev. Jesse Jackson for enlightenment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Rev. Jesse Jackson supports the ideas in the bill because he said the consideration of race is necessary to achieve the ideals of equality American culture has traditionally resisted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reverend is right. This bill is an attempt to achieve a kind of equality &mdash; an equality based on state management of the &ldquo;race market&rdquo; to achieve ensure a politically determined proper racial mix in all areas of life &mdash; that American culture has in fact traditionally resisted. And if that&rsquo;s not clear enough, Jackson adds: 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Using race as a factor is a good and necessary idea to make crooked ways straight,&rdquo; Jackson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That clears it up.
