				With attention fixed on security, politicians are ignoring the constituency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Gregory Rodriguez, L. A. Times, Jun. 27</i>

				This month, the Census Bureau announced that the U.S. Latino population was growing four times faster than the nation at large. In May, the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials projected that the Latino electorate had grown 17% over the last four years, and that nearly 7 million would cast ballots in November. Despite these gains, however, Latinos are not receiving the kind of media and political attention they did just four years ago. Has the Latino moment come and gone?

				Sept. 11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have pushed national security to the forefront of the campaign. The focus on battleground states has lowered the importance of the Latino voter. Fully 58% of Latinos live in the non-swing states of California, Texas and New York. Only an estimated one-fifth of the Latino electorate lives in heavily contested states &mdash; Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Florida. As such, these voters have received most of the attention.

				Bush&rsquo;s Latino strategy did pay dividends: He won 38% of the national Latino vote. But perhaps most important, it softened his image among suburban white moderates, particularly women, who weren&rsquo;t ready to vote for a fire-and-brimstone Republican. Democrats had no choice but to respond in kind. Behind closed doors, leading Latino Democrats were grateful to Bush for heightening their profiles within their party.
