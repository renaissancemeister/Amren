			<h1>
				Turkey Belongs in the European Union, Bush Says
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Susan Jones, CNSNews.com, Jun. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>(CNSNews.com)</b> &mdash; President Bush, calling Turkey a &ldquo;great and stable democracy,&rdquo; on Tuesday urged the European Union to admit Turkey to its ranks, a remark that will further infuriate the already miffed president of France. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Including Turkey in the EU would prove that Europe is not the exclusive club of a single religion. It would expose the &lsquo;clash of civilizations&rsquo; as a passing myth of history,&rdquo; Bush said in a speech in Istanbul. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, French President Jacques Chirac criticized Bush for urging Turkey&rsquo;s entry into the European Union. Chirac basically said that Bush should mind his own business. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is like me trying to tell the United States how it should manage its relations with Mexico,&rdquo; Chirac was quoted as saying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Tuesday, President Bush said NATO members, at their meeting in Istanbul, &ldquo;have dedicated themselves to the &ldquo;advance of reform in the broader Middle East, because all people deserve a just government and because terror is not the tool of the free.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He praised Turkey for &ldquo;showing how terrorist violence will be overcome&rdquo; by a &ldquo;just and tolerant society.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Turkey is a strong secular democracy,&rdquo; President Bush said &mdash; &ldquo;a majority Muslim society and a close ally of free nations.&rdquo; He said Turkey&rsquo;s democratic tradition &ldquo;stands as a model to others and is Europe&rsquo;s bridge to the wider world.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He noted that Turkey is &ldquo;moving rapidly&rdquo; to meet the European Union&rsquo;s criteria for membership. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;America believes that as a European power, Turkey belongs in the European Union,&rdquo; Bush said. &ldquo;Your membership would also be a crucial advance in relations between the Muslim world and the West, because you are part of both.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A year and a half ago, European leaders said Turkey would have to improve its human rights record before negotiations could begin for Turkey&rsquo;s membership in the EU. Turkey accused the EU of &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; against Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In December 2002, President Bush called French President Jacques Chirac and urged him to speed up negotiations for Turkish membership, but to no avail.
