				Endangering Us For Diversity&rsquo;s Sake
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Michelle Malkin, MichelleMalkin.com, Jun. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sigh. Another entry for my People&rsquo;s Republic of Maryland file. According to the <i>Washington Post</i>, the central planners and social engineers on the Montgomery County Council are in a huff because there are not enough minority firefighters. Is this because the libs are discriminating against non-white firefighters? No, it&rsquo;s because a <i>race-blind </i>hiring and testing process has produced results the council doesn&rsquo;t like: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				&ldquo;The current test may skew toward applicants who have previous volunteer firefighting experience, officials said. In Montgomery, that means a largely white pool of applicants.&rdquo; 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Imagine that. A test that favors firefighters who have &mdash; gasp! &mdash; experience. A council member has proposed diverting $200,000 away from emergency funds to rectify this discrimination against inexperienced and incompetent applicants and &ldquo;study&rdquo; how the test can be changed to produce more minority firefighters. In addition, Montgomery County executive Doug Duncan &ldquo;has ordered that the next recruit class, scheduled to begin this fall, be put on hold if necessary to increase the number of minority candidates.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Never mind that the county is currently experiencing a firefighter shortage. To hell with public safety. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, well. Putting political correctness before saving lives is nothing new here in Montgomery County. Doug Duncan was the man who <a href="https://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20030618.shtml">hired </a>former (thank God) police chief <a href="https://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20030305.shtml">Charles Moose</a>.

				Steps Urged to Hire Minority Firefighters
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Montgomery Lawmaker Proposes Study 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i> David Snyder, Washington Post, Jun. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Montgomery County Council member today plans to propose spending $200,000 to bolster recruitment of minority firefighters and to pay for a review of the firefighters test to determine whether it gives unfair advantage to white applicants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The proposal follows revelations last week that the county&rsquo;s current class of firefighter recruits has fewer minorities than any class since at least 1988. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Council member Tom Perez (D-Silver Spring), the resolution&rsquo;s sponsor, said, &ldquo;I want this to be the only recruit class . . . to have this lack of diversity.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The class of recruits that started training this month is 89 percent white &mdash; the highest proportion of whites since the county took over hiring from volunteer fire companies in 1988.
