				Full Disclosure of Funds Spent to Be Provided at June 29 Press Conference 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Federation for American Immigration Reform, Jun. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PHOENIX, June 28 /PRNewswire/ &mdash; The combined efforts of volunteers and supporting organizations who have worked to support the Protect Arizona Now (PAN) initiative will culminate in an event set for Tuesday, June 29, 2004, 10:00 a.m., on the lawn of the State Capitol. At that time, a press conference will be held, and the petitions turned over to the Chairman of the Protect Arizona Now initiative, Kathy McKee. It is now up to Ms. McKee to turn in the petitions, and all supporters stand ready to assist her in that vital leadership role. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The more than 100,000 signatures that will be delivered on that day are the result of the combined efforts of many volunteers, as well as the signature gathering support provided by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the FAIR Congressional Task Force, Americans for Better Immigration, POPSTOP and Americans for Immigration Control, Inc. These groups will continue to gather signatures until the July 1 deadline. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those attending will be: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Representative Russell Pearce </li>
				<li> Representative Randy Graf </li>
				<li> Rusty Childress </li>
				<li> Kathy McKee, PAN Chairman (invited) </li>
				<li> Claudia Bloom, PAN Treasurer (invited) </li>
				<li> Dan Stein, executive director of FAIR </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				According to Stein, &ldquo;There will be full public disclosure of how the funds were spent to gather these signatures. Every dime that FAIR and these other organizations have raised to obtain signatures for Arizona&rsquo;s PAN has been spent in Arizona to get signatures,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Moreover, I would like to personally thank the many people who have worked so hard to qualify this initiative for the ballot,&rdquo; said Stein. &ldquo;What they have done, and will continue to do, is in the best tradition of American participatory democracy. We believe that citizen efforts such as this deserve to be supported and we salute the people who have devoted their time, energy and resources to this effort. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Democracy is not always the neatest process, and we&rsquo;ve had our small bumps in the road, but they pale in comparison to the obstructionist tactics of the opposition who, at every point, sought to prevent the gathering of signatures,&rdquo; said Stein. &ldquo;We are united behind Kathy McKee, and looking for her leadership to complete this job.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Any petitions collected by groups here represented after June 29 will be given to Ms. McKee early on July 1.
