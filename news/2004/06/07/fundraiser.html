			<h1>
				Fund-Raiser Aided Firefighter Who Broadcast Racist Remarks
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Fran Spielman, Chicago Sun-Times, Jun. 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A controversial fund-raiser was held this past week for a veteran Chicago firefighter slapped with a 90-day suspension for using racist language in a conversation inadvertently broadcast over fire radio. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colleagues were reportedly hoping to raise roughly $20,000 &mdash; enough to compensate John Scheuneman for the salary and benefits he lost. But attendance at the Thursday night party at a South Side VFW hall was reportedly lighter than expected. They&rsquo;re now talking about holding a second fund-raiser. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ald. Freddrenna Lyle (6th) was not heartened by the fact that attendance was sparse. She can&rsquo;t understand why anyone would raise money to support a firefighter whose remarks triggered a wave of racist transmissions over fire radio. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There are two schools of thought,&rdquo; Lyle said. &ldquo;One is that there&rsquo;s this brotherhood [that says], &lsquo;We&rsquo;re gonna support our brother through good times and bad.&rsquo; The other is it sends a message that the action the firefighter committed is not unacceptable. My immediate reaction would be to say it&rsquo;s condoning his negative behavior. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, and it doesn&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to that kind of reaction from the firefighters union. We&rsquo;ve seen similar things from other unions, including the police union. I&rsquo;m not trying to kill this guy for something he said, probably as a slip of the tongue evidencing biases. I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t mean to make a political statement out of it. I just want it to stop.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neither Scheuneman nor Jim McNally, president of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2, could be reached for comment. The fund-raiser was orchestrated by Scheuneman&rsquo;s former colleagues at Tower Ladder 14 &mdash; not by Local 2. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The union has filed a grievance challenging Scheuneman&rsquo;s suspension on grounds that it was overly harsh, that the investigation was compromised by the Fire Department&rsquo;s decision to release a tape recording of Scheuneman&rsquo;s comments and that the 28-year veteran firefighter was transferred in violation of the union contract before the punishment was handed down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Feb. 2, Scheuneman was returning from a West Side run when he got angry at an African-American motorist driving a vehicle with Wisconsin plates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking to a supervisor, Scheuneman used the n-word at least three times, apparently unaware that the microphone on his radio was open. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before being suspended, Scheuneman was yanked out of predominantly black Austin on Chicago&rsquo;s West Side and reassigned to racially mixed Bridgeport on the South Side at the request of Ald. Emma Mitts (37th) after complaints from Austin residents fearful that Scheuneman&rsquo;s allegedly racist attitudes might translate into lax fire protection.
