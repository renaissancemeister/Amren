			<h1>
				Orland Park Officials OK Mosque
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Meeting filled with intense discussion of plan 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Stanley Ziemba, Chicago Tribune, Jun. 22</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				After hours of heated and emotional debate in which opponents expressed fears that a proposed mosque would foster terrorism, the Orland Park Village Board voted unanimously Monday night to annex the mosque site and allow construction to begin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although speakers at the Orland Park Civic Center were about evenly divided between supporters and opponents, catcalls and boos reverberated around the room when a supporter said it was wrong to fear the Muslim house of worship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Veronica Mattera, a village resident, reminded the more than 400 people in attendance that the meeting had started with the Pledge of Allegiance, which ends with the phrase &ldquo;liberty and justice for all.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Under the Constitution, everyone has a right to a place of worship,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But several people, starting with Rev. Vernon C. Lyons, pastor of the Ashburn Baptist Church, said they feared the mosque would attract Islamic extremists and violence to their community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As a Christian, a Baptist and an American, I am a firm believer in religious freedom, but when any group jeopardizes our national security and liberty, they are not deserving of our tolerance,&rdquo; Lyons said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While some also reiterated concerns that the mosque would create traffic problems and cause property values to decline, most, like Lyons, expressed fears about extremists &mdash; a fear that has gripped communities with mosques since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Opponents urged Mayor Daniel McLaughlin and the board to take no action on the proposal until village residents express their views in a referendum question. In the end, however, McLaughlin and the six village trustees said they had no choice but to approve the mosque. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We do this because we took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and because it is the right thing to do,&rdquo; said Trustee Brad O&rsquo;Halloran, speaking for his fellow board members. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Trustee James Dodge said: &ldquo;We cannot in good conscience not allow people to serve God in their own way. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If we said no to the mosque it would get built anyway,&rdquo; Dodge said, noting that the mosque site, up until Monday, was just outside the village boundaries on a parcel in unincorporated Orland Township. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is better for us to annex the mosque and let it be built in conformance with our [building] codes,&rdquo; Dodge said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Village attorney Kenneth Friker also made clear that state and federal laws prohibit a community from rejecting a house of worship because of objections to its membership or beliefs. In fact, McLaughlin advised residents in a letter last week that the U.S. Justice Department had been monitoring the controversy to make sure no federal laws were breached. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Richard Skrodzki, an attorney for the mosque&rsquo;s organizers, reminded opponents that those who would worship at the mosque are their neighbors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They live here in the community,&rdquo; Skrodzki said. &ldquo;They shop here and their children go to your schools.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Simmar Ali, a Muslim who has lived in Orland Park for five years, said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe some of the things I&rsquo;m hearing today. It&rsquo;s an attempt to smear the whole mosque community with terrorism.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 22,700-square-foot, gold-domed mosque &mdash; proposed by Orland Park businessman Malik Ali, Orland Park cardiologist Ali Kutom and Palos Heights pediatrician Mohamed Krad &mdash; is to be built on 4.3 acres owned by Krad at 16530 S. 104th Ave. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The three said the mosque, the first non-Christian house of worship among the village&rsquo;s 25, would accommodate about 500 worshipers. Throughout the debate, they&rsquo;ve said worshipers will be mainstream members of the community, who, like most Muslims, practice a moderate form of Islam. There would be daily services, with about 120 people expected to attend on Friday afternoons, the most popular service for Muslims.
