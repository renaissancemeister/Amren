				A &lsquo;Slim Majority&rsquo;????
			</h1>
			<p class="byline">
				<i>John Rosenberg, Discriminations, Jun. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Reader Bruce Sandys sends word of an incredible howler in the <i>Detroit News.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The headline of a Sunday <b>article</b> (copied below) boldly proclaims, &ldquo;Poll Suggests Slim Majority of Michiganders Favors Anti-Affirmative Action Proposal,&rdquo; referring to the effort to place a Proposition 209-like ban on racial preferences on the ballot in Michigan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After several long quotes from preferentialists, however, the article reports: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					But a January poll suggests a slim majority of Michigan voters support a ban on affirmative action in admissions and state hiring. A Detroit News poll conducted Jan. 7-12 of 400 registered voters found 64 percent of respondents favored a ban on affirmative action; 23 percent were opposed. 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Since when is three to one support for something &ldquo;a slim majority&rdquo;? 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>UPDATE</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				See this <b>important discussion</b> of polling results in Michigan, which demonstrates the mendacity of organizations supporting preferences.

				Poll Suggests Slim Majority Of Michiganders Favors Anti-Affirmative Action Proposal

				<i>Maureen Feighan, Detroit News, Jun. 20 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Programs aimed at recruiting, retaining and assisting students of color could become a thing of the past even with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling last year if a ballot drive to ban affirmative action in Michigan moves forward. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since January, organizers of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative have been gathering signatures to voters statewide decide on a ballot issue to ban the of race in admissions and state hiring. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the measure will have to get on the ballot first. Beset with legal problems for months by affirmative action supporters who argue the petition language is misleading because it doesn&rsquo;t tell voters how it will amend the state&rsquo;s Constitution, an appeal courts ruled just a week ago that the petition language was OK. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, organizers plan to push to have the measure on the ballot by November 2006. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What&rsquo;s important to me is that it gets on the ballot and that people have the opportunity to vote,&rdquo; said Barbara Grutter, one of the three plaintiffs who sued the University of Michigan over its admissions policies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics, meanwhile, call the measure &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; and say it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if not for conservative California businessman Ward Connerly. Connerly launched the petition drive in January after successfully leading similar efforts in California and Washington. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When you look at the unintended consequence of what happen under Connerly&rsquo;s scheme, rather than creating a color blind society this proposal really turns a blind eye to the discrimination that exists,&rdquo; said Dave Waymire, spokesman for Citizens for a United Michigan, a coalition of more than 25 unions, ethnic groups and business associations from across the state. &ldquo;There is discrimination out there. Should we try to figure out how to deal with it? The answer is yes. So don&rsquo;t we need some programs that take into consideration race to a certain extent? Yes, we do.&rdquo; 
			</p>

				But a January poll suggests a slim majority of Michigan voters support a ban on affirmative action in admissions and state hiring. A Detroit News poll conducted Jan. 7-12 of 400 registered voters found 64 percent of respondents favored a ban on affirmative action; 23 percent were opposed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The general population thinks that racial preferences are wrong,&rdquo; said Jennifer Gratz, who with Grutter was one of the plaintiffs that sued U-M and is now executive director of the ballot drive. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get past race as long as we allow our government to focus on race.&rdquo;
