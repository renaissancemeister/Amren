				S.F. May Give Non-Citizens School Board Voting Rights
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jessie Mangaliman, MercuryNews.com (CA), Jun. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a push to get more immigrants involved in their children&rsquo;s education, San Francisco officials are considering asking voters in November to give parents who are not U.S. citizens the right to vote in school board elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the proposed ballot initiative, even illegal immigrants would be able to vote, so long as they are parents with kids in public schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If the effort succeeds, San Francisco would become the first city in California to join a growing number of cities across the country that have adopted similar laws in recent years. The move could open the door for other cities or counties in the immigrant-rich Bay Area to follow suit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The controversial idea is already fueling charges from critics who say allowing non-citizens to vote devalues citizenship. But immigrant advocates and some voting-rights experts believe it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the state comes to grips with its new demographic reality: Almost one-fifth of all voting-age Californians are non-citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost a necessity for many cities,&rdquo; said Joaquin Avila, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles and a voting-rights expert who wrote a 2003 study on non-citizen voting and its potential impact on California. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a growing number of residents in your jurisdictions that are not part of the body politic. You want to have everyone inside the tent.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Voter qualifications</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the California Constitution, qualified voters must be at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen. But legal experts drafting the change to San Francisco&rsquo;s charter say municipalities have the right to define voting qualifications in local elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The idea here is not so radical,&rdquo; said Matt Gonzalez, president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and author of the proposal. &ldquo;Ultimately, we&rsquo;d like non-citizen voting in all municipal elections. This is a starting place.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Until 1926, almost two dozen states allowed non-citizens to vote. Chicago and several suburban towns in Maryland allow the practice, and Washington, D.C., is considering doing the same. New York City, which for decades allowed non-citizens, regardless of their immigration status, to vote in school board elections, also is looking to open up the vote in all local elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea also is not new for San Francisco. In 1996, the city attempted to extend voting rights to non-citizens in all local elections, but a state judge ruled the plan invalid because changes to voting rights must be done through a state constitutional amendment. Supporters hope the narrower focus of limiting non-citizen voting rights to school board elections would stand up to a legal challenge. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Details of how to implement the latest plan, if approved, are not yet known. It&rsquo;s also unclear if by singling out parents, the law would discriminate against non-citizens who do not have children in the school system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some observers say that could be a problem. Santa Clara County schools Superintendent Colleen Wilcox, who has not taken a position on the issue, said she would be concerned about creating a system that would &ldquo;exclude a portion of the population based on whether or not they had children.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				For immigrant parents like Miguel Perez, a permanent resident whose daughter attends a San Francisco elementary school, the right to vote in the school board elections boils down to a basic democratic principle: no taxation without representation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We want to have the right to choose because this affects our daily lives,&rdquo; said Perez, a member of an immigrant rights group that supports the proposal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1998, the school board voted to turn over the management and operation of a failing elementary school to a private New York firm. Perez and other non-citizen immigrants like Berta Hernandez opposed the hand-over but felt their views were not represented on the board. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hernandez, a Mexican immigrant and mother of two young children, plans to apply for citizenship soon, though she realizes the bureaucratic process can sometimes take up to 10 years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is not the key to solve all of our problems, but it&rsquo;s an important political tool to help us continue with the fight to have better schools for our children,&rdquo; Hernandez, 40, said of the San Francisco proposal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some critics say such a change would corrupt America&rsquo;s time-tested citizenship process. Others call the idea to allow undocumented immigrants to vote an outrage, although it&rsquo;s unclear how many immigrants would actually participate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The end, not the means</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That kind of learning process, assimilation if you will, is something that has to take place as part of getting ready for citizenship. Voting is the end point,&rdquo; said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based group that advocates strict immigration controls. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Krikorian said San Francisco probably has legal standing to allow the local voting, but he discredits &ldquo;the idea that this is a harmless measure.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				What&rsquo;s more, non-citizen parents have plenty of other avenues to participate in their children&rsquo;s education, such as the Parent Teacher Association, said Brenda Walker, spokeswoman for the Bay Area Coalition for Immigration Reform, a Berkeley-based group that supports reduction in U.S. immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arguments from both sides will be heard at a Rules Committee meeting of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Wednesday. The issue then heads to the full board for a vote, where five supervisors, including Gonzalez, have already expressed support to place it on the November ballot. Mayor Gavin Newsom is reviewing the proposal and has not taken a position, his spokesman Peter Ragone said via e-mail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether or not it withstands legal scrutiny, San Francisco&rsquo;s proposal moves the idea of non-citizen voting in California beyond the discussion stage. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is an exciting opportunity for cities across the country to really build a movement that recognizes that immigrant parents should have a say in their children&rsquo;s education,&rdquo; said Sheila Chung, executive director of the Bay Area Immigrant Rights Coalition.
