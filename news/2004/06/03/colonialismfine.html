			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>David Fickling, Guardian, smh.com.au, May 31 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Moves to give more independence to one of the world&rsquo;s last remaining and smallest colonies are being held up by opposition from an unexpected quarter &mdash; the population of the country itself.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Tokelau, an archipelago of three minuscule coral atolls 480 kilometres north of Samoa, is the only remnant of New Zealand&rsquo;s former Pacific colonies. Its dozens of coral islets, never more than 200 metres wide and five metres above sea level, support a population of 1400 living mainly by subsistence farming and fishing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Each atoll has a single village, and there are no harbours, no airstrips and no capital city. Visitors reach the islands only by the weekly boat making the 30-hour voyage from Samoa&rsquo;s capital, Apia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Settled by Polynesians about 1000 years ago, Tokelau became a British colony in 1889 and was passed to New Zealand in 1925. Since the mid-1970s moves had been made to give the country independence, but many Tokelauans fear change could leave them unable to support themselves. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tokelau&rsquo;s head of government, Patuki Isa&rsquo;ako, told a meeting of the UN Committee of 24 on decolonisation last week that the UN and New Zealand, not the islanders, were behind the moves. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Life as a New Zealand colony has brought many benefits to the country. There is no poverty, no unemployment, and full literacy. Although electricity does not run 24 hours a day, all houses now have internal flush toilets.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The New Zealand-appointed administrator, Neil Walter, said: 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Clearly independence is not on Tokelau&rsquo;s screen. A decision to become self-governing in association with New Zealand would do little more than recognise and confirm the status quo.&rdquo;
