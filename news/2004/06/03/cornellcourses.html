				Recently, I wrote an article called &ldquo;Summer Reading,&rdquo; which was intended to motivate my readers to take some time to read classic literature over the summer. While mostly apolitical, it did close with the following line, which was deemed offensive by one of my readers: &ldquo;(Go out and) pick up a great work of classic literature and enjoy the reading. You know, like the kind they used to assign in college when English professors taught English instead of homosexuality and feminism.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The offended reader, from Ithaca, New York, called my above assertion &ldquo;sexist, heterosexist, and gratuitous.&rdquo; So, naturally, I apologized. No, I&rsquo;m just kidding. Instead of apologizing, I decided to search the webpage of the nearest university English department to see what I could find. Naturally, I went looking first on Cornell.edu.
