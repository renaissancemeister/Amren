			<h1>
				Farmers Vow &lsquo;Tooth And Nail&rsquo; Fight Against Expropriation
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Christof Maletsky, The Namibian, allAfrica.com, Jun 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A DEFIANT group of commercial farmers whose land Government has identified for expropriation claim they are victims of immoral politicking and will fight it tooth and nail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Government served some 15 white farmers with expropriation notices and gave them 14 days to respond. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sigi Eimbeck from the Namibia Farmers Support Initiative (NFSI) told the media yesterday that the planned expropriation had nothing to do with land reform but was a campaign strategy by Lands Minister Hifikepunye Pohamba. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Minister, who is also Swapo Vice President, was elected as the party&rsquo;s candidate for the November presidential elections over the weekend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We should not be deterred or discouraged,&rdquo; Eimbeck told farmers affected by the expropriation plans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				NFSI claims that the 15 identified farms were worth around N$180 million and generated an annual turnover of N$10 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, they claimed that around 2 250 farm workers were about to loose their livelihood. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The farmers alleged that Pohamba wanted to use the farms as &ldquo;payment or gratification&rdquo; for those who campaigned and supported his race for the presidential candidacy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pohamba has denied allegations that he used the land reform programme for his political campaign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last week the Namibia Agricultural Union (NAU) wrote to the Government requesting an extension of the 14-day deadline. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The letter was also seeking clarity on certain issues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the farmers, the law was not being followed correctly and they contend that the process as a whole lacks transparency while Government is not clear on the meaning of &ldquo;public interest and just compensation&rdquo;, nor the criteria being used to identify the farms.
