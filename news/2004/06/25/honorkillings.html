			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Nicole Martin, Telegraph (UK), Jun. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police are to review more than 100 murders in an attempt to understand and prevent &ldquo;honour killings&rdquo;, it was announced yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The examination of 117 cases believed to be honour killings, which are classified as murders &ldquo;motivated by perceived dishonour to a family or community&rdquo;, was welcomed by an Asian community leader. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of victims were women, with many from south Asia, though there were some from Africa, eastern Europe and Arab countries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Scotland Yard announced the initiative amid growing evidence that women in the Asian community are being subjected to violence and sometimes murdered for defying cultural traditions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their perceived crimes can include wanting to go to university, refusing an arranged marriage, having a boyfriend or dressing in western-style clothing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are not re-investigating or re-opening the cases. Many have gone through the courts with convictions,&rdquo; said Commander Andy Baker, of the Metropolitan Police. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of looking at them, learning from them and working with agencies to prevent them in the future.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the murders under review were committed by contract killers, while others involved so-called &ldquo;bounty hunters&rdquo;, agents who are paid thousands of pounds to track down young people who have run away from their families. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The initiative follows the conviction last year of Abdalla Yones, a Kurdish Muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter 11 times and cut her throat after she forged a relationship with a Christian boy. He was jailed for life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Other cases include the murder of Sahjda Bibi, 21, who was knifed 22 times by her cousin minutes before her wedding last year. He was furious that she had broken with family tradition and chosen to marry a divorced man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2000 the United Nations estimated that 5,000 women worldwide were killed every year because they had allegedly brought shame on their families or communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But women&rsquo;s rights groups and Asian leaders believe the figure hugely underestimates the scale of the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ram Gidoomal is the chairman of the South Asian Development Partnership, a charity that aims to overcome divisions in ethnic communities, and author of the book Sari &lsquo;n&rsquo; Chips. He welcomed the review but said it should include suicide victims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Many more people are driven to suicide because of the &lsquo;dishonour&rsquo; that is purported to have been brought on the family,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The attempted suicide rate among young Asian women is four times the national average, and with men, too, it is rising.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said firm action was needed to protect people at risk, including the setting up of a code of conduct, signed by Asian community leaders, that would include &ldquo;an agreed and well-publicised&rdquo; form of whistle-blowing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also recommended extending existing telephone help lines to include services aimed at Asians, specifically young Asians, at risk. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There should also be a &ldquo;young Asians at risk&rdquo; register to enable police, social services and other organisations to maintain a confidential national database of vulnerable people. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Gidoomal added: &ldquo;It is time for responsible leaders within our ethnic communites actively to pursue practices that ensure that the rights of all citizens, particularly those vulnerable to assaults within the family, are not violated.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hannana Siddiqui, of Southall Black Sisters, a women&rsquo;s rights group, said the excuse of provocation, commonly used as a defence by killers, should not be accepted by the courts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The police also need to take complaints seriously rather than washing their hands of it because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen to be interfering with different cultures,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Scotland Yard announced its review as officers from across Europe gathered at The Hague to discuss ways of tackling honour killings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The conference, which was also attended by academics, was opened by a Swedish representative who highlighted the case of a 26-year-old Kurd shot dead, allegedly by her father because of her relationship with a Swedish man.

			<p>
				Heshu Yones, 16, had her throat cut by her father, Abdalla, and was left to bleed to death because he disapproved of her western way of life. Yones, a Kurdish Muslim who was jailed for life, had become &ldquo;disgusted&rdquo; by his daughter&rsquo;s behaviour. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a two-page letter found after her death, Heshu wrote: &ldquo;Bye Dad, sorry I was so much trouble. Me and you will probably never understand each other. For an older man you have a good strong punch and kick.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sahjda Bibi, 21, a Muslim, was murdered on her wedding day by two cousins who disagreed with her marrying a divorcee. Rafaqat Hussain stabbed her 22 times and Tafarak Hussain acted as the getaway driver but was also jailed for life after the jury decided the pair had planned the attack together. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rukhsana Naz, 19, was strangled by her brother, Shazad, with a piece of plastic flex while her mother, Shakeela, held her legs down. Both were jailed for life. Rukhsana was married to a man who lived in Pakistan but had become pregnant by her childhood sweetheart. She refused to have an abortion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nuziat Khan was strangled in 2001 and her husband, Iqbal Zafar, who is believed to be in Pakistan, is on Scotland Yard&rsquo;s most wanted list. Her family claim she was killed after she asked for a divorce because of abuse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tasleem Begum, 20, had an arranged marriage to an older Pakistani when she was 16. When her family discovered that she had fallen in love with a married Asian, her brother-in-law, Shabir Hussain, ran his car over her three times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was convicted of murder but at a retrial had his sentence cut to six and a half years for manslaughter after he changed his plea to guilty due to provocation.
