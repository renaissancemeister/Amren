				With soaring prison populations, especially of minorities, the U.S. must seek alternatives, bar association urges.

				<i>Henry Weinstein, L. A. Times, Jun. 24 <br>
				<br>

			</p>
			<p>
				Between 1974 and 2002, the number of inmates in federal and state prisons rose six-fold. By 2002, 476 out of every 100,000 Americans were imprisoned, according to Justice Department statistics. That compares with 100 per every 100,000 in Western European countries such as England, Germany and Italy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1982, the states and federal government spent $9 billion on jails and prisons. By 1999, the figure had risen to $49 billion. 
			</p>

				<i>{snip}</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also made pointed remarks about the demographics of the nation&rsquo;s inmates. &ldquo;Nationwide, more than 40% of the prison population consists of African American inmates,&rdquo; Kennedy said. &ldquo;In some cities, more than 50% of young African American men are under the supervision of the criminal justice system.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				That reality is not likely to change, according to the group&rsquo;s study. Based on trends, a black male born in 2001 has a 1 in 3 chance of being imprisoned during his lifetime, while the chances for a Latino male are 1 in 6, and for a white male, 1 in 17.
