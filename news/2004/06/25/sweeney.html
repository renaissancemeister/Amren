			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>George Raine, San Francisco Chronicle, SFGate.com, Jun. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The nation&rsquo;s most powerful labor leader came to San Francisco Tuesday to say that union leadership needs to look more like its target members. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Diversity was among the major themes addressed by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney in his speech at the national convention of Service Employees International Union, the nation&rsquo;s largest and fastest-growing labor union. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We cannot and will not bring millions of immigrant workers, women workers, people of color, gays, lesbians and transgender workers into our movement until they see themselves reflected radiantly and proudly in the faces of our leadership,&rdquo; Sweeney said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He went on to say both SEIU and his own executive council have become more diverse in the past eight years, &ldquo;but the gap between what unorganized workers see and what they need to see in us is still too wide, and until we close it we are not going anywhere.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sweeney&rsquo;s call for change in leadership and in clearing other obstacles to growth coincides with another significant potential reform now taking shape in organized labor: There is a group of labor leaders increasingly critically of the AFL-CIO structure &mdash; a loose affiliation of 61 autonomous unions that the group believes is outdated in a global economy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chief among the critics is Andrew Stern, president of the 1.6 million- member SEIU, who on Monday told the 3,000 conferees at the union convention at Moscone West that reform is necessary and overdue. He advocates a consolidated union movement that he believes will accommodate union growth, and said that with the AFL-CIO structure as-is, growth is difficult to impossible. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In an interview Tuesday during a union rally at Union Square, Sweeney, asked about Stern&rsquo;s comments, said, &ldquo;Our election in 1995 was all about change. It wasn&rsquo;t about who headed the AFL-CIO, it was where was the AFL-CIO headed, and I think there is going to be a good, healthy discussion about how we change.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In his SEIU convention address Tuesday, Sweeney added, &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re honest, we know we have to change faster and fight smarter and work even harder.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the second obstacle to organized labor&rsquo;s growth is &ldquo;the ability of employers to fold, spindle and mutilate the dreams of workers who want to form and join unions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The third obstacle, as Sweeney has long said, is President George W. Bush. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He told the union convention conferees, &ldquo;Your kind of commitment and leadership are what we must have, because the cold fact is that if we don&rsquo;t remove George W. Bush and replace him with John Kerry, nothing we&rsquo;re talking about will be even remotely possible. George Bush is simply the worst president we&rsquo;ve ever had to deal with &mdash; he and his cronies are as cold- blooded as bounty hunters when it comes to workers and our unions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kerry is scheduled to address the convention today.
