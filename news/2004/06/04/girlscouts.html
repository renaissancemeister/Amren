				<a href="http://www.denverhispanic.com/">Girl Scouts Of The USA Launched An Official Spanish-Language Web Site</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>DenverHispanic.com, June </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The new Web site provides important content on the Girl Scout program and opportunities available to the nation&rsquo;s girls, including Latinas, one of the fastest growing populations within the Girl Scout organization. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Research shows that U.S. Hispanics are rapidly embracing the Internet. In fact, even though Hispanics are relatively new to the Internet, they recognize the value it brings to their families and are quickly making its tools and features part of their daily lives, according to the second annual America Online/RoperASW U.S. Hispanic Cyberstudy (2004). The study also revealed that U.S. Hispanics with online access at home see the Internet as a powerful tool that can help improve the education and career prospects of their children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our number one priority at Girl Scouts of the USA is a full and ongoing commitment to diversity and serving every girl in every community.&rdquo; said Kathy Cloninger, CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA. &ldquo;The Spanish-language Web site ensures that Hispanic families also have the opportunity to access valuable information and resources that enrich the lives of Latina youth.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In keeping with its long history of diversity and inclusiveness, Girl Scouts of the USA is a founding member of Partners in Hispanic Education. Through this alliance of the nation&rsquo;s leading Hispanic organizations, corporate leaders, and private entities, Girl Scouts has hosted education fairs in cities around the country. In July 2004, Girl Scouts will host the fourth annual National Latina Conference in Savannah, Georgia. Created in 2001, the goal of the National Latina Conference is to celebrate Latino culture, promote community leadership and encourage inclusiveness.

				Girl Scouts of the USA is the leading organization for girls, and has more than 3.8 million members. Now in its 92nd year, Girl Scouting cultivates values, social conscience and self-esteem in girls while teaching them critical life skills to later succeed as adults. In Girl Scouting&rsquo;s special girls-only environment, girls discover the fun, friendship, and power of girls together. The organization strives to serve girls from every corner of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
