			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Christelle Terreblanche and Angela Quintal, Independent Online (SA), Jun. 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Draft legislation to eliminate hate speech, reminiscent of the controversial 2002 Zimbabwean law which clamped down on the media, has been published for comment by the government. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kimani Ndungu, the head of the Freedom of Expression Institute&rsquo;s anti-censorship programme, said some provisions of the draft Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill were virtually synonymous with the Zimbabwean Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Democratic Alliance human rights spokesperson Dene Smuts said she believed the institute was going a little too far by citing the Zimbabwean case, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s where we will end up if we don&rsquo;t protect our right to free speech&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She and fellow MP Sheila Camerer will seek a meeting with Justice Minister Brigitte Mabandla and her new deputy, Johnny de Lange, to discuss the draft measure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The draft bill, which seeks to make hate speech a crime in terms of the equality law adopted in 2000, is being circulated by the department of justice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It makes provision for fines, as well as prison sentences of up to three years for first offenders and six years for a second offence, relating to public statements of hatred based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ndungu said the offences were much too wide and subjective and not clearly defined enough to ensure an objective test in court. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A person could be found guilty just on the basis of intention to be hurtful, harmful or to intimidate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In South Africa&rsquo;s draft bill, four exceptions are made: for artistic creativity; for academic and scientific inquiry; for the publication of information in terms of the constitution; and for &ldquo;fair and accurate reporting in the public interest&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The institute has objected to the fourth exception in a submission to the justice department because of its similarity to the Zimbabwean legislation and because it is wide open to interpretation.
