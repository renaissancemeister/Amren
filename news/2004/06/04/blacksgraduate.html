				Why So Few Nonwhites Graduate from College
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Alamance Independent, May 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>&ldquo;The report by The Education Trust, a Washington-based non-profit, calls particular attention to the poor and to racial minorities, noting the majority of both Latinos and blacks who enter four-year colleges have no degree to show for it six years later. Overall, 63 percent of four-year college students earn a degree within six years, the usual benchmark for college completion.&rdquo;</strong> -Associated Press, May 27, 2004. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>And </strong>why is that? Last Thursday, many &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; dailies ran a long wire story &mdash; including the part above &mdash; but none of that wire story touched the explosive real issue: why so few nonwhite freshmen graduate to anything but student-loan debt. It&rsquo;s no secret that the graduation rate for blacks in college is abysmal &mdash; as in for black <em>males</em>. A black syndicated columnist even recently stated it in a column that ran in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; daily in nearby Greensboro. Although he never commented on it, he also cited the graduation rate for black <em>women</em> in college &mdash; a rate about that of European-Americans, male or female. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nobody in either the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media &mdash; or in university administrations &mdash; wants to talk about it. But the policies of college administrators are self-defeating &mdash; at least if the goal is graduating more nonwhite students to anything other than loan debt, rather than just milking them for tuition for a year or two, because so many leave that soon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Jimmy Carter administration, a federal lawsuit against this state&rsquo;s &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; state university ended in an out-of-court settlement &mdash; in which UNC-Chapel Hill was to meet one quota for black freshmen, another for black sophomores by certain deadlines. And that was the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meeting the freshman quota was easy; all the university had to do was become &mdash; effectively &mdash; open-admission for blacks. But it never met the sophomore quota &mdash; simply because so many of those admitted under special open-admissions rules for blacks flunked out or dropped out that fast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That &mdash; in a single example &mdash; was why so few nonwhite freshmen, particularly males, ever graduate. It&rsquo;s easy admitting just about any nonwhite applicant in the name of &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; The problem hits in his first freshman math course months later. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Math is what keeps most students who fail from graduating. In other courses, it&rsquo;s easy to &mdash; at least &mdash; pass by either just coming to class and listening to the prof or just staying home in the dorm and reading the text. You can have failed every social-studies course in school &mdash; and graduate with honors majoring in history in it when you go to college. But not only doesn&rsquo;t that work in math, but there is another huge problem for weak students &mdash; that math is a <em>sequential</em> subject. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Didn&rsquo;t learn third-grade math? You won&rsquo;t learn fourth-grade math &mdash; and you won&rsquo;t learn algebra when you get to high school, either. And that sequential nature unique to math isn&rsquo;t repealed because you&rsquo;re nonwhite. Nor is it repealed because you didn&rsquo;t learn a year of math in elementary school because you had a bad teacher that year &mdash; something more likely in chaotic ghetto schools that really are &ldquo;farm systems&rdquo; for affluent suburbs seeking proven teachers for their schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a very-real sense, it thus doesn&rsquo;t matter whether nonwhites &ldquo;need&rdquo; reverse discrimination due to genetic-inspired lack of skill or from having attended poor schools or from &ldquo;societal racism.&rdquo; If a guy didn&rsquo;t learn junior-high math, he isn&rsquo;t likely to pass the one or two college math courses required to graduate in any major he might choose &mdash; even physical education. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, the diversity racket makes lots of money for colleges, pacifies black and Latino activists &mdash; but dooms lots of students to nothing but graduating to heavy student-loan debt. If you really want a higher percentage of nonwhite freshmen to graduate, you have to admit them on the same basis as everyone else. It&rsquo;s time to tell the truth.
