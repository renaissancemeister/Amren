				<a href="https://www.townhall.com/columnists/mikeadams/ma20040604.shtml">Liberals Miss Entire Point, Details At Eleven</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Mike S. Adams, townhall.com, Jun. 4</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yesterday, I ran a polite <a href="https://www.townhall.com/columnists/mikeadams/ma20040603.shtml">article</a> entitled, &ldquo;English for lesbians, feminists, queers, and communists.&rdquo; The article began with a reference to a previous article that had offended a liberal reader. And now it appears that yesterday&rsquo;s article has offended yet another liberal. In fact, it appears to have offended several liberals. Here&rsquo;s what just one had to say after I wounded his inner child: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<em>&ldquo;Dr. Adams, I just read your article on Town Hall. You misled me. You gave a list of English faculty at Cornell with expertise in Marxism, and queer, and feminist literature, but you didn&rsquo;t mention others with expertise in Shakespeare. What a horrible article. Why didn&rsquo;t you provide the full information to the readers?&rdquo;</em> 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Well, that one is pretty easy to answer. I gave the readers the link to <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">cornell.edu</a>, just two lines above the summary so they could check out the English Department for themselves. Read carefully, liberals! 
			</p>
			<p>
				And for all the other liberals who didn&rsquo;t understand the point of the article, here it is in bold letters: <strong>English departments are becoming increasing politicized and, hence, increasingly irrelevant.</strong> If you wish to rebut the thesis, here&rsquo;s that web address one more time: <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">cornell.edu</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, it would have been correct for me to mention in my article that there are three English professors at Cornell who claim expertise in William Shakespeare. But, of course, many of today&rsquo;s English professors use Shakespeare only to talk about gay and trans-gendered issues. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, pick up a copy of the Pelican Shakespeare version of &ldquo;As You Like It.&rdquo; Just read the introduction and you will soon realize that expertise in Shakespeare isn&rsquo;t all it used to be. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And of course, the real questions for my liberal readers follow: Why are there as many experts in Karl Marx as there are in William Shakespeare in the Cornell English department (three apiece)? And why are there eight experts in sexuality and homosexuality? Shouldn&rsquo;t more professors take an interest in Shakespeare than in &ldquo;queer literature?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The politicalization of English as well as other disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humanities is a serious issue. Last semester, a student came by my office after she withdrew as a graduate student from the UNC system. She said that she was tired of being forced to read materials that were overly political and irrelevant to her chosen field of study. Specifically, she claimed that her required reading materials were anti-Christian, anti-male, and anti-white. Like a good conservative, I did not accept her argument at face value. Nor did I claim that she was trying to mislead me. I just did a little research on one of the authors that she claimed she was forced to read. A quick examination of the required reading list revealed that the student did, in fact, have to read the poetry of Haunani-Kay Trask, whom she claimed to be an anti-Christian, anti-male, racist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, I picked up a collection of her poems. Here&rsquo;s what I found: 
			</p>
			<p>
				From the poem &ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<i>Christianity loves God&rsquo;s children <br>
					Not the infidel or African <br>
					But European Americans <br>
					*** <br>
					Crusading armies, a slave&rsquo;s hand <br>
					Cut off at the wrist, driven into the snow <br>
					God&rsquo;s justice, white, death <br>
					White cold, cleansing the sin of blackness <br>
					Sin of color.</i> 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				From the poem &ldquo;Long Term Strategies&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<i>We can&rsquo;t rape men <br>
					Put anything in them <br>
					Against their Will <br>
					*** <br>
					But in Pele&rsquo;s hills <br>
					Beneath the bloody moon <br>
					Young women&rsquo;s dancers <br>
					Learn castration as an art.</i> 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				From the poem &ldquo;Racist White Women&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<i>I could kick your face <br>
					Puncture both your eyes <br>
					You deserve this kind of violence <br>
					*** <br>
					Just a knife slitting your tight <br>
					Little heart <br>
					*** <br>
					A fist in your painted <br>
					Mouth <br>
					*** <br>
					A sworn Black promise <br>
					To shadow your footsteps <br>
					Until the hearse of violence <br>
					Comes to get you.</i> 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				By the way, the above collection of poems is called &ldquo;Light in the Crevice Never Seen.&rdquo; That is an appropriate title, given that the author seems to have her head squarely planted in a place where the light is never seen. However, it is not appropriate that the book was written with grant money from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s right, ladies and gentleman (as well as &ldquo;both&rdquo; and &ldquo;questioning&rdquo;). Taxpayer-supported anti-Christian, anti-male, racist garbage is really &ldquo;art.&rdquo; And it is required reading in graduate courses in some English, Women&rsquo;s Studies, Native American Studies, and History Departments around the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But make sure you check my facts, liberals. And, by the way, how am I doing on my central thesis? For those who have forgotten my central thesis, it&rsquo;s in bold letters above. In fact, it&rsquo;s just above the web address for Cornell University, which is <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">www.cornell.edu</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And, while you&rsquo;re at it, shouldn&rsquo;t you do some more research on your own to find out what is being taught at your local university or at your alma mater? And, please, do it before you blindly make another donation to higher education. I don&rsquo;t want anyone to be misled by their so-called educators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Mike Adams (</em><em>www.DrAdams.org</em><em>) also gets a lot of positive mail. Yesterday, someone wrote saying, &ldquo;You are now my favorite columnist, tied up with Ann Coulter.&rdquo; Dr. Adams really appreciated that. He has always wanted to be tied up with Ann Coulter. Dr. Adams&rsquo; wife no longer reads his editorials, so he speaks his mind freely. And, liberals, just in case you didn&rsquo;t get the web address for Cornell University, here it is again: </em><a href="https://www.cornell.edu/"><em>www.cornell.edu</em></a><em>.</em>
