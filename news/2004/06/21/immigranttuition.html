				<a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/8930862.htm">Immigrant Tuition Ignores Law</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Kris W. Kobach, Kansas City Star, Jun. 16 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				On May 20, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius signed into law a statute giving in-state tuition at Kansas universities to illegal aliens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The following day, I appeared on &ldquo;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&rdquo; and criticized this law as unfair to Kansas taxpayers and out-of-state students. I pointed out that if an estimated 2,000 illegal aliens took advantage of this subsidy, it could cost Kansas taxpayers more than $15 million a year. I reiterated these arguments in a letter published by <i>The Star.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Star</i> columnist Mike Hendricks, who thinks subsidizing the tuition of illegal aliens is just fine, attacked my position. Specifically, he accused me of making up the number 2,000. According to Hendricks, &ldquo;the number is a fiction.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Where did I get the number? From <i>The Kansas City Star</i> itself! On April 25, Mary Sanchez reported that the Kansas law &ldquo;would allow &hellip; about 2,000 &hellip; Kansas seniors to pay in-state tuition.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, it is inherently difficult to estimate how many illegal aliens will exploit this law. According to conservative and now-outdated INS estimates from four years ago, approximately 8,000 illegal aliens are in grades 1-12 in Kansas. Extrapolating from those estimates, up to 2,667 aliens might receive in-state tuition each year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, not all eligible illegal aliens will take advantage of this subsidy. It could be 2,500, or it could be 500. But it will cost Kansas taxpayers millions in either case. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More important, Hendricks and two other <i>Star</i> columnists who criticized my arguments utterly ignored the main reason that Kansas&rsquo; law is objectionable: It&rsquo;s illegal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It violates federal law on two levels. First and foremost, the Kansas Legislature itself violated federal law by passing the bill. In 1996, Congress enacted a federal statute specifically prohibiting state governments from giving in-state tuition to illegal aliens. The Kansas Legislature flagrantly disregarded this federal law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond the illegality of the legislation itself, Kansas is now encouraging aliens to violate federal immigration laws. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kansas handsomely rewards illegal behavior with a valuable education benefit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Amazingly, the Kansas law denies in-state tuition to those legal aliens who have a valid student visa. Aliens are told: &ldquo;In Kansas, we encourage you to violate the law. If you actually get a valid visa to study here, we will penalize you by making you pay out-of-state tuition.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s utterly absurd. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We must restore the rule of law in immigration. Unfortunately, Kansas isn&rsquo;t helping. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kris Kobach is a Republican candidate for Congress in the 3rd District of Kansas. In 2001-2003, he served as the U.S. attorney general&rsquo;s chief adviser on immigration and border security.
