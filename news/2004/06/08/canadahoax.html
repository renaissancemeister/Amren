			<h1>
				Hateful Deception?
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Pulse24.com (Toronto), May 28</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a crime that had residents shaking their heads in dismay and disgust. But now that&rsquo;s turned to anger, after the arrest of two people for an explosion that police say was designed to look like a hate crime. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It took place March 28th in Vaughan, when authorities were called to a business called Central Pallet on Rowntree Dairy Road. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When they arrived, they found someone had blown up part of the building and painted swastikas on the front entrance. It appeared to be the latest in a series of hate crimes that had been plaguing the north end of the G.T.A. for weeks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But York Regional Police now contend it was all a ruse, after the Fire Marshal&rsquo;s investigation showed the blaze was arson, and was deliberately set. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities have now taken a man and his common-law wife into custody, charging them with a variety of offenses, including arson, fraud, and obstructing justice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirty-year-old Syzad Ally and 25-year-old Ramrattie Surujnath both made a court appearance earlier this week and have been released. They&rsquo;ll be back to face the judge again on July 6th.
