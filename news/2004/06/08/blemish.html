				Education School Aims To Address Mulitcultural Crisis
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				The school&rsquo;s diversity committee worries about producing culturally insensitive teachers and alumni, citing ways to improve the situation 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Chelsea Duncan, Oregon Daily Emerald, Jun. 7 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Allegations of cultural insensitivity and incompetence within the University College of Education have led the school&rsquo;s student and faculty diversity committee to recently declare a &ldquo;multicultural crisis.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Graduate student Jim Lyda, coordinator of the college&rsquo;s Ethnic Diversity Affairs Committee, said students of color in the college have experienced cultural insensitivity from some faculty members. He said local schools also have raised concerns that the college produces teachers who lack multicultural skills. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of what we term a crisis,&rdquo; Lyda said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The committee, which advocates for students of color in the college, proposed a list of recommendations to the deans in March, including: The creation of a 5-year plan to address the issues; standardized and enforced procedures for handling complaints; and diversity training for staff and faculty. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Education Associate Dean for Academic Programs Linda Forrest said EDAC&rsquo;s recommendations have created &ldquo;powerful dialogue&rdquo; throughout the college. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The College of Education &mdash; which is ranked eighth out of the nation&rsquo;s education graduate schools, according to a 2005 U.S. News and World Report survey &mdash; has many diversity initiatives in place, she said. The school was recently awarded an Interdisciplinary Reading Group Award from the University Center on Diversity and Community, which will allow a group of the college&rsquo;s faculty members to study methods for developing culturally responsive practices. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Shadiin Garcia, student support-services coordinator for the Sapsik&rsquo;wal&aacute; (Teacher) Education Program, said problems have existed in the college for years. But an incident during the February Career Beginnings conference, during which students learn tips for future interviews, &ldquo;brought it to the forefront,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the conference, students in the college learned the importance of firm handshakes and direct eye contact when meeting with potential employers. When a student of color raised concerns that her culture does not encourage such interactions, a comment by Springfield school district&rsquo;s Director of Human Resources Roger Jordan was perceived to be culturally insensitive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jordan said he had explained what he calls &ldquo;the blemish effect,&rdquo; which is something that might distract a potential employer during the interviewing process, such as cultural differences. He said the meaning was misconstrued and that he did not intend to propose that the student&rsquo;s culture was a &ldquo;blemish.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My comments there caused quite a flap at the University,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that bothers me tremendously.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, Jordan said he has tried to improve his understanding of what it means to be culturally sensitive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Garcia said Jordan&rsquo;s comment was offensive. She said that more importantly, faculty members did not have the skills to address the incident at the time or effectively talk to students about it later. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The professors were ill-equipped to deal with it,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Garcia and Lyda said they did not feel comfortable listing other instances of cultural insensitivity for fear of retaliation against the students involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Because of the numbers (of students of color) and the nature of some of the incidents, it&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo; Lyda said. &ldquo;You always have to worry about grades or being ostracized.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Forrest said she&rsquo;s aware that fear might exist, but she added that students have many outlets to raise complaints including the Bias Response Team and with herself. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to communicate to them is it&rsquo;s OK to complain,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In April, representatives from local organizations and schools attended a meeting on campus to address the problems within the college, Lyda said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The community kind of joined in to put some pressure on the College of Education to make some changes,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Committee members have also raised concerns that the College of Education is producing future teachers who lack multicultural skills needed for working in increasingly diverse local school districts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Forrest said Jefferson Middle School has been reluctant to allow graduates or students of the University&rsquo;s College of Education to practice teaching at the school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I would say it has to do with wanting greater confidence in the cultural competency,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re working to change that.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eugene 4-J School District&rsquo;s Human Resources Director Wally Bryant said the school&rsquo;s reluctance to bring in student teachers from the college was a protest against the college&rsquo;s multicultural shortcomings. He added that he feels the quality of job applicants is improving, however, which is important because Eugene&rsquo;s demographics are changing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Cultural competency is one of the things we&rsquo;re looking for in candidates,&rdquo; he said. While he is satisfied with the students coming from the college, Bryant said anything the University can do to improve those skills is appreciated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Forrest said it is important for faculty members within the college to learn to be more supportive and respectful of cultural differences. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We need to model that for students in our classrooms who are going to be teaching in public schools,&rdquo; she said.
