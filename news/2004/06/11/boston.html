			<h1>
				Bronx Cheer For Southie: New York Delegation: It&rsquo;s Too Racist For Us
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>David R. Guarino, bostonherald.com, Jun. 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				New York Democrats &mdash; after mistaking South Boston&rsquo;s historic L Street Bathhouse for a gay club &mdash; have demanded their official convention party be moved out of the neighborhood entirely because of its &ldquo;racial&rdquo; past. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirty years after the forced busing crisis rocked South Boston, New York&rsquo;s Democratic Party chief told Boston officials the neighborhood isn&rsquo;t good enough for the Empire State&rsquo;s Democratic National Convention reception. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I am deeply concerned about the selection of South Boston as the reception site given its history of racial turmoil and tension,&rdquo; Herman Farrell Jr., the New York party boss, wrote in an April letter to organizers, obtained yesterday by the Herald. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Farrell, who is black, said, &ldquo;For those of us who were on the frontlines of (the civil rights) struggle, the prospect of celebrating in a neighborhood that so fiercely opposed integration is very troubling.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The letter had Southie pols fuming &mdash; even as New York delegation officials yesterday grudgingly accepted South Boston as a reception site. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously written by someone who is ignorant,&rdquo; said South Boston City Councilor James M. Kelly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Southie native Michael F. Flaherty, a city councilor at large, said, &ldquo;They can always bring their resident pit bull Don Zimmer to protect them, if they feel that&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimmer, a former New York Yankees coach, went after Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez in a brawl during last year&rsquo;s playoffs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				New York officials, after being contacted by the Herald, suddenly backed off their flat-out refusal to be hosted in South Boston. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Those were concerns,&rdquo; said Chung Seto, executive director of the New York Democratic Party. &ldquo;We have been shown that South Boston is a new Boston and, therefore, the case is resolved.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the July DNC, the city host committee &mdash; Boston 2004 &mdash; will put on a party for each state delegation. To foster citywide spirit, Mayor <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/search/?searchSite=recent&amp;keyword=Thomas%20M.%20Menino">Thomas M. Menino</a> decided to place the parties in different neighborhoods. 
			</p>
			<p>
				New York was assigned the Curley Recreation Center, known commonly to locals as the old L Street Bathhouse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last week, a gossip column in the New York Post reported delegates weren&rsquo;t happy because in the 1980s in New York, bathhouses were notorious gay clubs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sources in City Hall and at Boston 2004 said they believe New Yorkers were mostly miffed they didn&rsquo;t land one of the choice party spots &mdash; like the John F. Kennedy Library or the Museum of Fine Arts. They said the reported homophobic and racial concerns were just a smokescreen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Out of all the sites we chose, this was one of the best,&rdquo; said Julie Burns, director of Boston 2004. &ldquo;If they still have concerns when they come to the event, all their concerns will be allayed.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Burns said the party, moved last week allegedly because costs were too high, now likely will be held at the Curley Center after all. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Menino&rsquo;s director of neighborhood development, Michael Kineavy, said anyone who has visited South Boston knows it&rsquo;s &ldquo;open to all.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Mr. Farrell obviously hasn&rsquo;t visited South Boston in a long time, if ever. If he had, he would find a very welcoming environment,&rdquo; Kineavy said.
