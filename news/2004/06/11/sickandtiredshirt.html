			<h1>
				Controversial T-Shirt Intrigues And Offends
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Liz Hill, Detroit Free Press, Jun. 11 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nothing sells better than controversy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s what three Detroit-area men discovered after they outfitted their buddy in a white shirt with black writing that said &ldquo;I AM SICK AND TIRED OF WHITE GIRLS.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was just a funny T-shirt,&rdquo; said Michael Young, one of the founders of iamsickandtiredof whitegirls.com. &ldquo;And then everyone started wanting one.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The joke quickly snowballed into a marketing plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Young, 24, and his partners, Steven Luch, 23, and Tom Cusmano, 27, began selling the intriguing but offensive shirts at events around the country, most recently at the Movement festival in Detroit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The questions: Who&rsquo;s buying them, and why? 
			</p>
			<p>
				The controversial slogan is an &ldquo;advertising gimmick,&rdquo; they say, used to spark interest in their company, whose real objective, they say, is &ldquo;uniting local musicians.&rdquo; The company puts on concerts, working with such acts as Downtown Brown, Dubphonics, Switchstance and the Furious Styles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the company&rsquo;s inception in October 2003, the trio has sold more than 6,000 of the shirts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At just $5 each, the shirts went like hotcakes over Memorial Day weekend at Hart Plaza, showing up mostly on white men and, get this, white women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When asked why they bought the T-shirt, white men (almost no one of color was seen in the shirt at Movement) merely chuckled and said something along the lines of, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo; Young white women &mdash; the slogan&rsquo;s intended target &mdash; just laughed. None of them offered to explain why the provocative tagline was worth putting on their chests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Opponents of the T-shirt were more articulate about their concerns. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I find it very ignorant,&rdquo; said April Gutierrez, a 22-year-old from Trenton who was offended by the ubiquity of the T-shirts at Movement. &ldquo;I mean, if you saw a black man or a Latino man wearing that shirt, it would be considered racism. But mostly it&rsquo;s white girls. Maybe I&rsquo;m not in on the joke, but I just find it disgusting.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The message, and what you make of it, depends on who you are and who&rsquo;s wearing it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The idea is to call your attention,&rdquo; said Ruth P. Rubinstein, author of &ldquo;Dress Codes: Meanings and Messages in American Culture&rdquo; (Westview Press, 2001). &ldquo;We do have freedom of speech.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She sees this particular slogan as harmless because of the traditionally high social position of the butts of the joke. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;White women are seen as status symbols,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So everyone knows it&rsquo;s a joke.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				If the shirt targeted black women, for instance, the joke would be lost and the shirts could be construed as seriously racist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With many of the T-shirts being worn by white men with their white girlfriends in tow, the message is more ironic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a reverse joke,&rdquo; said Rubinstein, associate professor of sociology at New York&rsquo;s Fashion Institute of Technology. The men and women &ldquo;know it&rsquo;s not true, so it&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The company&rsquo;s founders aren&rsquo;t worried about making enemies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You&rsquo;re either going to laugh at us or be offended by us,&rdquo; said Young. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Either way, we have your attention.&rdquo; 
			</p>
