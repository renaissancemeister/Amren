				<a href="../../../../news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/06/10/nvote10.xml">Elections Cast Into Doubt By Post Vote Turmoil</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Chris Boffey and George Jones, Telegraph (UK), Jun. 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Four police forces are investigating hundreds of alleged cases of postal vote fraud that could cast doubt on the integrity of today&rsquo;s local and European elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last night the Electoral Commission, an independent body set up by Parliament to monitor elections, confirmed that it was investigating irregularities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, feared a repetition of scenes in Florida in the American presidential election when individual votes were scrutinised. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There could be lawyers arguing in court for weeks or months,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Liam Fox, the Conservative Party co-chairman, said the Government&rsquo;s refusal to listen to advice had created a system open to widespread abuse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The spectre of fraud and intimidation has been brought to the heart of the electoral system by a Government which possesses the toxic mixture of arrogance and incompetence.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ann Cryer, Labour MP for Keighley, West Yorks, feared that the majority of the ballot frauds were part of &ldquo;a cultural problem&rdquo; that faced Asians in the North. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said Muslims were coming under pressure from community elders to surrender their votes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People are going to homes, demanding that the voters give up their ballot papers &mdash; and that is what they are doing.&rdquo; She said the Asian community &ldquo;tends to stick together&rdquo; and, if one of its leaders knocked at the door and asked people to do something, &ldquo;they by and large do it&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said: &ldquo;It is the sort of thing I was anxious about in the early stages of getting the Bill through to have an all-postal ballot. But I did not dare mention it because you are accused then of being a racist. But the chickens are coming home to roost.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				It would be no surprise if the election results were challenged in the courts, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police in Greater Manchester, Lancashire, West Yorks and Derbyshire said they were investigating hundreds of alleged cases of fraud. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Greater Manchester police were looking into allegations of malpractice in Oldham, Rochdale and Tameside. Two men, including a Liberal Democrat candidate, have been arrested over the Oldham allegations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lancashire police were preparing to question 60 people over suspicions about 170 proxy vote applications. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their investigations centre on claims that supporters of mainstream parties collected ballot papers door to door or filled in blank papers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Derby, in the East Midlands poll area, allegations of fraud have been referred to the police by Michael Foote, the council&rsquo;s returning officer. They include a complaint that a postal vote was cast despite the voter being in India and not knowing about the election. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Postal voting is being tried out in four regions of England: the North East, North West, East Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At Prime Minister&rsquo;s questions the Tories accused the Government of &ldquo;breathtaking complacency&rdquo; after John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, played down concerns about widespread fraud, vote-stealing and intimidation in postal ballots. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Michael Ancram, the deputy Conservative leader, said the &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; of the past few weeks had undermined public confidence in the integrity of the voting system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He cited reports of fraud, late delivery of ballot papers and voters who had yet to receive their voting packs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Prescott, standing in for Tony Blair, who is at the G8 summit, said MPs should &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; the fact that a million additional votes had already been cast in the areas testing all-postal ballots. The scheme could have raised turnout by as much as two million by the end of today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the reports of fraud were allegations that had yet to be investigated. The Government was determined that any fraud or malpractice should be &ldquo;harshly dealt with&rdquo;. The offence of personation carried a maximum sentence of two years in jail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Prescott&rsquo;s department issued figures showing that 3,856,000 ballot papers, representing 27 per cent of the electorate, had been returned in the four pilot regions by Tuesday night, two days before polls closed. That compared with a total of 2,870,735 votes (20 per cent) cast in the 1999 European elections.
