				Culture Clash Ends With Fists
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Fighting between blacks, Somalis blamed partially on lack of understanding 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Encarnacion Pyle and Matthew Marx, Columbus Dispatch, Jun. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				What started as a spat between children of different cultures resulted in a fracas involving 60 people in a North Side apartment complex last week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A day later, the 61 Somali Bantus who had moved into the complex in the past two months began moving away. Both they and the black Americans they left behind have hard feelings about an incident they say was rooted in disrespect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many say the incident is a sign of the times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As Columbus becomes increasingly diverse, the infusion of customs is resulting in simmering tensions between new immigrants and established communities such as American blacks,&rdquo; said Marilynn Brewer, an Ohio State University psychology professor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no easy cause to the rift or solution to bridge the cultures or resolution to the identity issues.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				They can live in the same neighborhood and share similar skin color and African roots, yet still differ in language, religion and culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Misunderstood, these different mores and cultural values can lead to miscommunication, fear, stereotypes and even hatred,&rdquo; said Yusuf H. Abucar, president of the Somali Community in Central Ohio. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But embraced, they can make our community stronger.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last Monday&rsquo;s melee at 1626 Shanley Dr., in the Breckenridge Apartments, illustrates the subtle and not-so-subtle tensions that can arise when a community grapples with its growing diversity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The two sides gave varying accounts of the altercation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several of the Somali Bantus, a persecuted African tribe that started arriving in Columbus in mid-March, said tempers flared after a 9-year-old black girl slapped a younger Bantu boy at 4:30 p.m. in the parking lot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But many of the black teens said a 16-year-old Bantu boy started the fight when he hit the girl, Shauntera Pettus, in the cheek with his shoe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Parents from both sides met in the parking lot and argued about which of the children should be punished and how. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They hit my sister. . . . I don&rsquo;t like their culture. I don&rsquo;t like that a dude could beat up a girl and get away with it,&rdquo; said Damion Pettus, 19. &ldquo;What are we supposed to do &mdash; let them hit our kids?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Habib Hassan, 21, said the blacks were taunting them, saying, &ldquo;Where are these stupid guys from anyway?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;First, they hurt our children, then they abused our dignities,&rdquo; Hassan said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The confrontation subsided before flaring again about 5:30 p.m. when Damion Pettus and his friends returned to the lot because they believed the Somali Bantu teen hadn&rsquo;t been punished. They were joined by neighbors and others who don&rsquo;t live in the complex, Pettus said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At 8 p.m., a fistfight broke out between the groups. The Bantus said an angry mob of blacks armed with bats, bricks, rocks and sticks broke the windows of several of their apartments. But the blacks said the Bantus were the ones with weapons and that they outnumbered the blacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They ransacked our apartments, breaking teapots, stealing bikes and taking videos,&rdquo; said Ali Hassan, 16. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pettus said he and his friends weren&rsquo;t involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Columbus police were called twice to the complex and filed a criminal-damaging report at 9:41 p.m. No one was arrested. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Five Bantus were taken to the hospital Tuesday for minor injuries, and all 15 Somali families who lived at the Breckenridge Apartments &mdash; 61 people in total &mdash; were moved to another apartment complex off Rt. 161. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahado Mohamed said moving helped ease the trauma. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The incident was so scary we slept Monday night all in one apartment,&rdquo; Mohamed said while stringing a colorful bead necklace for one of her children. &ldquo;I have a good feeling about this new complex. It feels peaceful.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many community leaders were hesitant to talk about the fight, but they acknowledged that miscommunication and cultural differences inflamed the situation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It got out of hand,&rdquo; said James Stowe, director of the city&rsquo;s Community Relations Commission. Stowe has said Columbus&rsquo; growing diversity is the city&rsquo;s most-pressing issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There was a real breakdown of cultural understanding,&rdquo; said Beth Gerber, associate director of Jewish Family Services, which is helping the Bantus adjust to life in the United States. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tragic, but maybe a little understandable considering some of our folks have only been here one week and others only barely two months.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is not the first time something like this has happened. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 16-year-old Somali boy was left unconscious and three female Somali students were forced to transfer to other schools in January after a fight with blacks at Mifflin High School. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And disagreements have exploded into verbal and physical fights across the city, including at the Capital Park apartments on the North Side, where a mini-brawl in 1998 prompted complex managers and community leaders to start providing cultural-education classes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It happens more than we like to think,&rdquo; said Hassan Omar, president of the Somali Community Association of Ohio. &ldquo;And it will only get more complicated as the community becomes more ethnically diverse.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar problems have plagued other cities with large refugee populations, such as Lewiston, Maine, Minneapolis and San Diego. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Religious differences &mdash; Somalis are largely Muslim, while black Americans are mostly Christian &mdash; can be a source of misunderstandings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes refugees who don&rsquo;t speak English or understand American customs expect blacks to put out the welcome mat and help them get on their feet. Meanwhile, some blacks believe the Somalis are being pushed to the front of the line for public assistance and receive undeserved breaks, said Angela Plummer, director of Community Refugee &amp; Immigration Services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And the tug of war between Somali traditions and American culture can lead to rifts, especially for immigrant teens struggling to find acceptance in both worlds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those and other differences are compounded by the distance that Somalis and black Americans often put between themselves, interacting as little as possible even when living side by side, Omar said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many say the answer lies with education, openness and understanding. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Often people who look like complete opposites find they have a lot more in common when they sit down at the lunch table and get to know one another,&rdquo; Plummer said. &ldquo;The problems aren&rsquo;t rooted in maliciousness, but misconceptions.&rdquo;
