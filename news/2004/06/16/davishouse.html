			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>AP, SunHerald.com (MI), Jun. 7</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>BILOXI, Miss. &mdash; </b>Officials say an alert Biloxi firefighter likely saved historic Beauvoir, the last home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, from extensive damage due to what appeared to have been a deliberately set fire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fire officials said they were investigating the &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; Saturday blaze which was limited to the area of the front doors of the 160-year-old tourist attraction along coastal U.S. 90. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Battalion Chief Kerry Borden said investigators should know more early this week. He would not discuss the preliminary findings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Beauvoir officials believe the fire was deliberate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Somebody attempted to burn the house,&rdquo; said Patrick Hotard, executive director of the historic home and library. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hotard said an off-duty firefighter saw smoke and &ldquo;jumped the fence and extinguished the fire.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The firefighter, David Lemasters, doused the fire using a water-filled trash bag. Beauvoir&rsquo;s security guard had not seen the flames. The home&rsquo;s large front doors were charred and several glass panels in the doors appear ruined. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hotard said damage to the front porch was limited by door mats that apparently kept the fire from burning planks, which had recently undergone $120,000 in repairs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The doors seem to be in pretty bad shape,&rdquo; Hotard said. &ldquo;The deck is in good shape.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Beauvoir is owned by the United Sons of Confederate Veterans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No one has claimed responsibility for the fire. Hotard said he did not know whether it was timed to spoil a Saturday party to celebrate Jefferson Davis&rsquo; birthday. The party went on as scheduled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the library, grounds and visitor&rsquo;s center remain open for tours, the home will be closed until an investigation and repairs are complete, officials said.
