				Candidates seeking Hispanic vote ignore public opinion, push for visa reform, experts say 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Mark Helm, timesunion.com (NY), Jun. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; A solid majority of Americans oppose increasing the number of legal immigrants in the United States and legalizing immigrants who are in the country illegally, according to opinion polls. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet both President Bush and presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry support increasing the level of legal immigration and giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Independent analysts say the political lure of Hispanic votes explains the disconnect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Gallup poll last January found that three-quarters of Americans believe the United States should not make it easier for illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 2003 New York Times/CBS poll showed 55 percent of Americans wanted a decrease in legal immigration, 35 percent wanted no change and 7 percent wanted more immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite this apparent sentiment, Bush has proposed allowing illegal immigrants already in the country to be eligible for legal temporary worker visas. Workers with the temporary visas wishing to become permanent residents and citizens would be able to apply for citizenship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While Kerry has not outlined a detailed plan, he has endorsed the concept of &ldquo;earned legalization&rdquo; &mdash; an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have lived in the United States for a &ldquo;certain time,&rdquo; are working and have passed a background check. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors tighter border control and less legal immigration, says he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;know of any other issue where politicians so blatantly disregard the will of the people.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				William Schneider, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, says the explanation rests in presidential politics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Hispanics are seen as a key to winning not only this election, but elections for decades to come,&rdquo; Schneider said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanics have been the nation&rsquo;s largest minority group since 2000, when their population grew to 35.3 million, eclipsing the 34.7 million African-Americans. Census projections show the Latino population will rise to 102.6 million people by 2050, amounting to 24.4 percent of the country&rsquo;s 419.9 million people. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration experts estimate that 8 million to 10 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States. An additional 500,000 undocumented immigrants enter the country each year, according to the Census Bureau. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Schneider said Hispanic voters consider immigration a top issue that can determine their vote. He also notes many Hispanics favor a tighter border and reject granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But he added the Hispanic community views politicians that come out strongly against illegal immigration as &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; their community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They may agree with the politician&rsquo;s position, but they see it as the politician using their community as a scapegoat for the illegal immigration problem and as a way to get white votes,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				James Gimpel, a political scientist at the University of Maryland who studies immigration and politics, said non-Hispanic white voters, while overwhelmingly in favor of tighter borders, don&rsquo;t view the issue as important enough to change their vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;For most white voters, immigration is in their top 10, but it&rsquo;s not in their top three, and it&rsquo;s those top three issues that determine how people vote,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, Gimpel said, politicians from both parties can propose increasing legal immigration and giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship without paying a political price in the non-Hispanic white community.
