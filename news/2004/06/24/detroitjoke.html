			<h1>
				Giangreco Gets Benched For Joking About Detroit
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Robert Feder, Chicago Sun-Times, Jun. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A joke made at the expense of the city of Detroit and the NBA Championship-winning Pistons has landed Chicago&rsquo;s No. 1 sportscaster in trouble with his bosses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mark Giangreco will begin serving a one-week suspension without pay Monday for a bit he delivered during his sports report on WLS-Channel 7&rsquo;s late newscast Tuesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on the Pistons&rsquo; victory, Giangreco showed an old black-and-white movie clip of a city being burned to the ground and joked that it was &ldquo;just another typical night for Detroit.&rdquo; He followed that immediately by saying that he was &ldquo;just kidding.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among complaints received by the ABC-owned station were some from viewers who perceived that the joke had racial overtones. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I now realize those comments and visuals were inappropriate and insensitive, and I deeply regret making them,&rdquo; Giangreco said in a statement. &ldquo;While I did not intend to offend our viewers, I feel badly that I have. Please accept my apology.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Channel 7 officials declined to comment, calling it a &ldquo;personnel matter.&rdquo; No action was taken against any other employees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Known for his wit and smart-aleck demeanor, Giangreco, 51, has been the highest-paid sportscaster in Chicago since he joined top-rated Channel 7 in 1994 after 12 years at WMAQ-Channel 5. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The disciplinary action comes several weeks after Channel 7 suspended reporter Sarah Schulte for making disparaging remarks about minorities in off-air comments that were picked up by a microphone and recorded on a digital server.
