			<h1>
				Cannon Bests Throckmorton In Bid For Re-Election To House
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Nicole Warburton, Salt Lake Tribune, Jun. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				From the quiet of his Washington, D.C. office, Utah Rep. Chris Cannon celebrated his victory Tuesday night over challenger Matt Throckmorton in the 3rd Congressional District Republican primary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cannon won a bit more than 58 percent of the vote to nearly 42 percent for Throckmorton with all precincts counted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I really wish I were at home with my family and supporters, but it&rsquo;s important I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Cannon said in a telephone interview. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m relieved and I think this shows that the people of Utah are really optimistic about the future of Utah. I think I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of things for Utah that are really important.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Throckmorton conceded as the returns rolled in giving Cannon a large margin of victory. Still, the former state legislator described his campaign as a victory, pointing out he thrust a four-term congressman into a primary and had a strong showing in Utah County despite being outspent $307,510 to $37,006. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In political terms, it&rsquo;s a victory,&rdquo; said Throckmorton. &ldquo;In terms of public policy, it&rsquo;s a stunning defeat.&rdquo;He was referring to Cannon&rsquo;s stand on immigration; Cannon wants to grant certain groups of foreign agricultural workers a temporary &ldquo;guest worker&rdquo; status, but Throckmorton and other groups have called the proposal an &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; and hammered the congressman on the issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Immigration reform&rdquo; groups spent nearly $80,000 on radio ads and billboards to educate voters about the Cannon-sponsored bill they say would grant &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; to illegal aliens, according to Cannon spokesman Joe Hunter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the race turned nasty in the weeks leading up to the election, with supposed threats by &ldquo;immigration reform&rdquo; group ProjectUSA. Last week, ProjectUSA Director Craig Nelsen hinted the group might challenge the votes of some foreign-born residents, but the group never acted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nelsen said that Cannon was soliciting votes from illegal immigrants with aide Marco Diaz on a Spanish-language radio station. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nelsen said the results of the election were discouraging, but he said his group would be &ldquo;twice as busy&rdquo; in Utah to educate voters about the need to strengthen America&rsquo;s borders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well known how difficult it is to overcome the power of corporate lobbyist money,&rdquo; Nelsen said. &ldquo;But until Congressman Cannon comes clean with Utahns and admits he supports amnesty for illegal aliens, we must continue to try.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rosemary Jenks, spokeswoman for NumbersUSA, another immigration reform group, said: &ldquo;What the people are being told is not the same thing he&rsquo;s doing in Washington.&rdquo;
