				1979 ruling sought to address high numbers of African-American students put in special education 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Grace Rauh, Oakland Tribune Online, Jun. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				UNION CITY &mdash; Pamela Lewis is no savvy activist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She doesn&rsquo;t know how to write a press release or craft a picket sign, but the mother of five is determined to trigger a grass-roots campaign against a rule that bars her 6-year-old son from receiving a standardized IQ test &mdash; because he&rsquo;s an African-American. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s discrimination, it&rsquo;s a violation of my son&rsquo;s civil rights and it&rsquo;s racism,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fighting this all the way.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ruling comes from the 1979 case of Larry P. v. Riles, in which a judge decided that IQ tests could not be administered to African-American children to determine their placement in special education classes in California. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ruling sought to address the overabundance of African-American students who were placed in special education classes after performing poorly on the IQ test, Lewis said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lewis doesn&rsquo;t deny that the test may have been discriminatory toward African-American children in the past. She&rsquo;s just convinced that the educational playing field is more level today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is closet racism within the school district and the courts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Basically they&rsquo;re saying if you&rsquo;re black, you&rsquo;re dumb.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lewis learned about the ruling when registering her son Nicholas for speech therapy with the New Haven Unified School District in May. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This comes up occasionally in our school district,&rdquo; said Blaine Cowick, director of special services for the New Haven district. &ldquo;Do I agree with Larry P. or not? I think there&rsquo;s room for it to be reviewed. I think it would have to be challenged by a group of parents, or a legislature would have to do some work on it. . . . I don&rsquo;t think a district would be in a position of taking it on.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The district is following a state directive by withholding the test from African-American children, Cowick said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lewis said district officials told her that if she really wanted her son to take the test, she should mark him down as a Caucasian because he is biracial. She refused. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lewis is searching for legal representation to help her efforts, but she hasn&rsquo;t found any takers. Some people she has spoken with have urged her not to fight for access to a racially biased test, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Lewis said her fight isn&rsquo;t to scrap the IQ test altogether. 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Some African-American parents may want their child to take the test, and some may not,* she said. *As a parent, I know what&rsquo;s best for my child &mdash; not the courts or the school district.* 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lewis is planning to picket New Haven district offices in a few weeks to raise more awareness about the ruling, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My son could take that standardized IQ test and get a high score.&rdquo;
