			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Libby George, Star Tribune (MN), Jun. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON, D.C. &mdash; The federal government will provide an additional $3.3 million this year to help settle Hmong refugees in Minnesota, Wisconsin and California, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Department officials said the money is a &ldquo;safety valve&rdquo; that will ease the burden on state and local governments, but members of Minnesota&rsquo;s congressional delegation said they will continue to push for more money. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The extra money is available through Sept. 30 to ethnic groups and refugees in the three states, which must compete for the money to pay for job and language training and other such resettlement costs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				St. Paul is expected to receive about 5,000 of the 15,000 Hmong refugees from Wat Tham Krabok, the camp in Thailand that is closing. The first of those immigrants arrived in the Twin Cities on Monday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this year, Minnesota Sens. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, and Norm Coleman, a Republican, joined several other senators in requesting an additional $10 million in fiscal year 2005 appropriations to resettle Hmong refugees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum submitted the same request in the House. More than $19 million in federal funding was already available to the three states to resettle refugees, but Coleman, McCollum and Dayton said an increase of $3.3 million is not enough. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is really just a down payment on what has to be done for the federal government to fulfill its obligation,&rdquo; Coleman said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dayton said that while the $3.3 million increase was &ldquo;important initial financial assistance . . . it does not obviate the need for the $10 million.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				McCollum spokesman Josh Straka said McCollum will continue to pressure Thompson to support the appropriation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The influx from Wat Tham Krabok has raised some concern in Minnesota about the state&rsquo;s ability to resettle the refugees, particularly in light of a housing crunch, teacher layoffs and a tight job market in St. Paul, which has the highest Hmong concentration of any U.S. city.
