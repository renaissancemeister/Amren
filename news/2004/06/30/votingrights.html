				E. Palo Alto&rsquo;s Irony: Latinos Have No Power
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Minority Blacks Control The City Council 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Joe Rodriguez, MercuryNews.com, Jun. 25 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				After making his delivery, the UPS man approached a Latino clerk at a Home Depot store in the poorest town in Silicon Valley. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Are you registered to vote?&rdquo; the UPS man asked in Spanish. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No, what difference would it make? the clerk asked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; the UPS man said. &ldquo;When they cut spending at your children&rsquo;s school, don&rsquo;t complain. And don&rsquo;t complain when they throw out your immigrant relatives.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UPS driver pulled out a thick stack of voter registration forms and handed one to the clerk. Gives new meaning to the company&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;What can brown do for you?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				At age 29, with a boxer&rsquo;s physique, a golden boy smile and a bilingual gift of gab, UPS driver Everardo &ldquo;Lalo&rdquo; Luna wants to become the first Latino elected to the East Palo Alto City Council in 16 years. That&rsquo;s a tall order in a town on the brink of a voting-rights showdown between Latinos and blacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While Latinos are now the town&rsquo;s largest racial group, African-Americans still control the city council. A national Latino advocacy group wants to file a lawsuit to change the election system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just waiting for six, seven or eight Latino leaders to give me the go-ahead,&rdquo; said Alberto Carrillo, a spokesman for the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another thing you need to know about East Palo Alto is that people here are fiercely proud, defensive and suspicious of outsiders. I suppose that comes natural in a poor, minority town surrounded by rich, white suburbs. It doesn&rsquo;t help to have a reputation for official corruption and incompetence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t know if a voting-rights lawsuit would spark a race riot or prevent one, but it would appear to be a legal slam dunk. East Palo Alto&rsquo;s city council is elected at large instead of by districts, a system that allowed whites to control cities in the Northeast and the South after blacks had become the majority. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some black residents see the irony. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We ought to be the most understanding of prejudice and denial of any people on the planet,&rdquo; Bob Hoover recently told a Mercury News reporter. He runs a youth golf program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But there isn&rsquo;t a consensus among the black leadership to change the status quo. In some political camps, bringing up the question is an insult. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed at how little people know about our city,&rdquo; councilwoman Patricia Foster told me on a visit to a program she runs for children of all races. &ldquo;I represent everyone in town. Blacks, Latinos, whites. Latinos voted for me as much as blacks did.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				What&rsquo;s really going on in this town of 30,000? It&rsquo;s an age-old story. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The wheel has turned again,&rdquo; as Luna put it. &ldquo;The established group wants to hold onto power while the newcomers want to be heard. The same thing happened when the Italians started moving out of East Palo Alto and African-Americans moved in.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				About all both sides can agree on is that few Latinos in town register to vote, fewer still show up at the polls on Election Day, and many can&rsquo;t do either because they&rsquo;re not U.S. citizens. Local campaigns to register Latino voters have been modest at best. Meanwhile, national groups like LULAC and the Southwest Voter Registration Project have succeeded elsewhere through voting-rights lawsuits and registration drives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve been off the radar,&rdquo; Luna said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said he became interested in public office when, as a sheriff&rsquo;s cadet, he was hassled by a foul-mouthed Latino member of the city&rsquo;s police department. That led him into public activism and, eventually, appointment to a city commission. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Frustrated by the lack of Latino appointments, Luna and two Latino running mates ran for council in 2000. They were trounced. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We got caught up in that racial debate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I learned that kind of stuff doesn&rsquo;t get you anywhere.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				So he&rsquo;s registering voters from his delivery van, polishing his political pitch to voters of all races. Luna said he hasn&rsquo;t made up his mind about a voting-rights lawsuit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Latinos and blacks live side by side here, so what would district elections do?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have to represent everybody, show them that your policies are theirs and that one group&rsquo;s values are the same as the other&rsquo;s values.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				We hear this sort of talk on political TV commercials all the time, but you have to admit it&rsquo;s more appealing coming from a truck driver who hands out voter registration forms on his route. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I keep it brief,&rdquo; Luna said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never missed a delivery.&rdquo; 
			</p>
