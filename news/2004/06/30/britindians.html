				Indians Largest Non-White Group In Britain
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>IndiaTimes, Times of India, Jun. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LONDON: Indians comprise the largest ethnic minority group among Britain&rsquo;s population of some 60 million, said a government study here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<a id="adcept"></a>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) emphasised Britain&rsquo;s changing ethnic make-up with 4.6 million people describing themselves as &ldquo;non-white&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Just over 92 percent of British residents were white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among ethnic minorities, Indians were the largest group, followed by Pakistanis, people of mixed race, black Caribbeans, black Africans and Bangladeshis. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of non-white Britons has risen by 53 percent in the past decade. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ONS said Britain was home to 59.2 million people in 2002, a rise of 9 million in 50 years and of 1.7 million in the past decade. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It estimates the population will reach 64.8 million in 2031 because of higher life expectancy and the &ldquo;increasingly important factor&rdquo; of immigration. The average age of the population has risen from 34.1 years in 1971 to 38.2 in 2002 and is projected to reach 43.3 in 2031. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The data, from the 2001 census and more recent surveys where available, shows a total of 8.3 percent of residents (4.9 million) were born abroad, almost double the proportion recorded in 1951. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Population of those born outside Britain increased more between 1991 and 2001 than in any of the preceding post-war decades. Immigration increased from 265,000 people in 1993 to 513,000 in 2002, while the numbers leaving the country rose from 266,000 to 359,000 during the same period.
