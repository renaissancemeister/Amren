				<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6964-2004Jun25.html">A City Lost to Shame</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Colbert I. King, Washington Post, Jun. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Are we so inured to the pain of D.C. children that their problems no longer register with us? 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>{snip}</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to a summary of a public hearing before the D.C. Council&rsquo;s Judiciary Committee on March 29, Reginald Ballard, principal of Cardozo Senior High School, testified that 11 months earlier a student was shot in the school&rsquo;s basement by someone who brought a gun into the building through an open door. Ballard said the doubling of surveillance cameras and new security doors in the building have improved school security. Asked about weapons in the school, Ballard said there are no weapons inside Cardozo, &ldquo;that security guards recover weapons at doors quite frequently.&rdquo; Steve Tarason, principal at Wilson Senior High School, said that as of March, 10 knives had been recovered and one gun was discovered by a D.C. police officer outside school grounds. &ldquo;He noted that 60 percent to 70 percent of weapons recovered at Wilson are recovered on Mondays, when students typically bring weapons to school to protect themselves from incidents that occur in the community over the weekend. He said it appears that most students carry weapons for safety, not for malicious intent.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, stay with me on this. Ballard and Tarason may not know it, but they are case-hardened principals. They feel victorious because weapons no longer make it past the doors of their schools. The fact that students are coming to school armed is treated as neither new nor interesting. Therein hangs the tragedy.
