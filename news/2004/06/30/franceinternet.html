				France Outlaws Discussion of Islam
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>John Derbyshire, National Review Online, Jun. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				At least we can still talk about Islam. An e-acquaintance who lives in France tells me that over there things are now at the point where you can get into trouble just for mentioning the fact that Muslims are ever any kind of a problem. Synagogue burnings &mdash; a pretty regular occurrence in France &mdash; are routinely blamed on &ldquo;right wing neo-Nazi white males,&rdquo; he tells me. In fact the perpetrators are extremist Muslim Algerian Arabs. French people all know this, but have to pretend not to. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Then he writes: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					On the TV news of Wednesday night, they presented a conference about &lsquo;hate speech&rsquo; on the Internet. They took as example the police in action against a &lsquo;hate web site.&rsquo; The only thing I could read on the web page they were showing was &ldquo; . . . against the Islamization of Europe . . .&rdquo; Indeed, according to the law, to be against the Islamization of Europe is racism . . . and forbidden. France not only doesn&rsquo;t recognize there is a war, it forbids by law to say there is a war . . . 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Don&rsquo;t think for a minute there aren&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.cair-net.org/asp/chapters.asp">people in this country</a> who would like similar laws.

				<i>Jamey Keaten, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Jun. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PARIS &mdash; Battling hate crime that takes root through the Internet requires more cooperation by governments, online companies and human rights groups, experts and officials agreed Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Delegates from 61 nations ended their two-day Paris meeting on anti-Semitic, racist and xenophobic propaganda on the Internet with no accord, but said the top achievement was to spell out and work to overcome differences on how to curb online hate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is a great deal of opportunity to move in common,&rdquo; U.S. Assistant Attorney General Dan Bryant told reporters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The meeting, sponsored by the 55-country Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was among the largest of its kind bringing together governments, human rights groups and Internet service providers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Envoys urged better education about online hate, expansion of access of Web filters for parents and better enforcement by Internet service providers of their own contracts that forbid hate speech. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A U.S. delegation wrapped up the conference with a 10-point &ldquo;action plan&rdquo; that called for studies on the effectiveness of bans on online hate speech and its link with hate crime. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some European delegates, some of whose governments have banned public hate speech, called for new laws, a position that conflicted the U.S. defense of nearly unfettered free expression and preference for market-based controls. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have heard some advocate that hate speech on the Internet must be suppressed. Respectfully, we disagree,&rdquo; said U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Stephan Minikes. &ldquo;Rather than fear the purveyors of hate, let us confront them in the marketplace of free ideas.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				France, which has faced an upswing in violence against Jewish schools, cemeteries and synagogues in recent years, acknowledged that cracking down of hate on the amorphous Internet is difficult. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Certainly the task is not easy &mdash; as witnessed by the work in the last two days,&rdquo; said French Education Minister Francois Fillon. &ldquo;We must keep in mind that the Internet represents a formidable prod to knowledge.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But even as technologies improve, hatreds of old remain, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In a paradoxical way, even when we are emerging from a century of iron and blood . . . some of the demons that ravaged history in the last centuries have resurfaced here and there,&rdquo; Fillon said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But delegates stopped short of calling for new international agreements, and said cooperation should come through enforcement of existing laws and sharing of strategies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many speakers highlighted the difficulty of outlawing hate speech on a borderless, easy-to-use and anonymous medium that allows purveyors of hate to quickly evade controls by authorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A ban in Europe, for example, will do nothing to stop it worldwide,&rdquo; Christopher Wolf, chairman of the Internet Task Force of the U.S. Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. &ldquo;People would just send it (to the Internet) from boats in the ocean.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The recommendations are to be on the agenda of an OSCE ministerial meeting in Bulgaria &mdash; which currently holds the group&rsquo;s presidency &mdash; in December.
