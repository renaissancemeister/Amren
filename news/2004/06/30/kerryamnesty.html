				<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040629-104129-6788r.htm">Amnesty Eyed For Illegal Aliens</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, Jun. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PHOENIX &mdash; Sen. John Kerry yesterday promised an amnesty for most illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for at least five years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is time to fulfill the promise of America, so that those who work hard and take responsibility and build a better life for them and their families, and live by the rules, and pay their taxes and raise their families have a right to share in America and its citizenship in the fullest,&rdquo; the Democratic candidate for president said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kerry, speaking to the National Council of La Raza&rsquo;s national conference, said that within 100 days of taking office, he would propose a four-part plan that would give a citizenship path to illegal immigrants who have paid taxes while living here and who pass a security screening. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kerry joins a roiling debate over how to deal with the estimated 8 million to 12 million illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hispanic advocacy groups have called for an extensive amnesty for most of those immigrants, and Mr. Kerry&rsquo;s proposal yesterday drew the strongest applause of his 50-minute speech. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kerry&rsquo;s plan goes much further than President Bush, who has proposed a guest-worker program that would allow current illegal immigrants and foreigners living overseas to apply for a renewable three-year temporary visa. Mr. Bush also proposed increasing the number of green cards issued each year, though he didn&rsquo;t specify by how much. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Mr. Kerry called Mr. Bush&rsquo;s plan &ldquo;exploitative,&rdquo; dismissing it as &ldquo;work in America for low cost and never have a chance to be a citizen.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bush&rsquo;s plan was labeled an amnesty by those who want stricter controls on immigration, and Mr. Kerry&rsquo;s plan is bound to draw the same charge. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several immigration plans are already pending in Congress, including one by Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, that would create a temporary-worker program but require participants to return home at the end of their period. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Cornyn yesterday said he was happy Mr. Kerry joined the debate, but said his plan goes in the wrong direction. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is an agenda, I&rsquo;m afraid, that does little beyond encouraging further illegal immigration, and certainly does nothing to re-establish respect for the law or address the underlying economic issues,&rdquo; Mr. Cornyn said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kerry&rsquo;s proposal resembles other pending bills &mdash; one by his Massachusetts Democrat colleague Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and two key House Democrats; and the other by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, South Dakota Democrat, and Sen. Chuck Hagel, Nebraska Republican. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Daschle-Hagel plan requires that the immigrants have worked here for four years, including at least a year after the bill becomes law, and that they pay a $1,000 fine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kerry did not say whether his plan also included any fines, but said he would have the immigrants take civics and English classes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said he believes in enforceable borders, and promised to work with Mexico &ldquo;to reduce the incentive for people to come here illegally, and to increase the ability of people to come here legally.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kerry made a brief mention of increasing border security, and said he wants to fix terrorist watch lists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also pledged to sign two bills now pending in Congress: the Dream Act, which would legalize many illegal immigrant college students, and an agriculture guest-worker program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier yesterday in Chicago, Mr. Kerry proposed a $4,000-per-year tax credit to help students pay for college, and a $10 billion fund for states to invest in public colleges and universities, as long as states commit to keeping tuition increases at the rate of inflation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking to the Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow-PUSH Coalition conference in Chicago earlier yesterday, Mr. Kerry painted a bleak picture of education in America, arguing that schools aren&rsquo;t graduating enough math and science students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said schools seem to kill women&rsquo;s and minorities&rsquo; interests in those fields, and he promised to lead a campaign to change that. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As president, I will give all Americans, especially women and minorities, the same encouragement, and we have to give it early on,&rdquo; he said, adding that he will support all-girls schools, some of which have graduated many students interested in math and science.
