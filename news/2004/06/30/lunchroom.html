			<h1>
				New Attitudes: Try Crossing Racial Lines
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>LaShana Lee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Jun. 29 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope they know that nobody&rsquo;s gonna do this. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s what I was thinking when Nia Umoja, a club in my school that advocates cultural diversity and tolerance, planned Mix It Up Day last November. Mix It Up Day is a national project that encourages students to cross social boundaries, and Nia Umoja&rsquo;s plan was to get students to sit with people we wouldn&rsquo;t normally sit with at lunch, particularly people of other races. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as important as diversity and tolerance are, Mix It Up Day was just another failed attempt to get all students to &ldquo;step outside the box.&rdquo; No one was really willing to sit with different people. Everyone took it as some sort of joke, and the majority of students understood we wouldn&rsquo;t actually participate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though not successful at racial and cultural blending, Mix It Up Day was a good idea. It&rsquo;s just that racial rejection hurts, and most of us don&rsquo;t want to experience it over where we sit at lunch. Though most students in our school generally embrace other cultures and races, the fact remains that black sits with black and white sits with white in our cafeteria. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Racial differences often make us feel we have to censor ourselves. When I&rsquo;m around my black friends, we make jokes about how black people act and speak; if a person of another race were to make the same jokes, that would probably offend us. Just the same, we would refrain from making jokes about people of other races around them to prevent from offending someone, not because they&rsquo;re degrading jokes, but because there is always the possibility that they can be taken offensively. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since lunch is supposed to be my free time, I want to be able to speak freely with my peers. I also sit with these people because I have a lot in common with them. We all grew up in majority black neighborhoods, and we were raised to speak our minds, yet ironically we usually get in trouble for doing so. Now I know there are people of other races who were raised to do the same, but all the people I&rsquo;ve encountered who were raised like this are black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rejection never feels good, but I imagine it would feel worse if I were rejected by people of my own race because of whom I associate with. Black students are often called &ldquo;oreos&rdquo; if they associate too often with white people. The term implies that although these students are black physically, they are &ldquo;white on the inside,&rdquo; or they have qualities that may cause others to characterize them as white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This possibility of being called an oreo can discourage black students from interacting with other races. Peers viewing you as &ldquo;not being black enough&rdquo; has to be hurtful. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, white students who often associate with black students are sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Eminems&rdquo; of the student body. Eminem is a white rapper, and because of his rapper lifestyle, some people say he is trying to &ldquo;act black.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				After transferring last year from a majority black school to Chamblee, a very diverse school, I began to open my eyes to the fact that there are people of other cultures. My need to be comfortable may hinder me from discovering new and great things about other races, and I may miss an opportunity to get to know someone of another race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As time goes on, maybe we&rsquo;ll one day be able to socialize comfortably with people of other races. As we honor the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision that changed America for the better, I encourage all of us to step outside the box and Mix It Up.
