			<h1>
				Wisconsin Prepares For Hmong Refugees Amid Funding Concerns
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Melissa McCord, AP, GrandForksHerald.com, Jun. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>MILWAUKEE &mdash; </b>Some social service agencies worry they might not have enough money to provide medical care, training and other aid to several thousand Hmong refugees coming soon to Wisconsin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Budgets were tight because of the slow economy even before officials learned in December about the estimated 3,300 Hmong refugees expected to start arriving next month throughout Wisconsin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some officials told The Associated Press they&rsquo;re wondering how they can cover the costs of helping the refugees, whose arrival is expected through December. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hard-pressed to care for the folks that we currently have,&rdquo; said Larry Hagar, social services director of Marathon County, which expects more than 450 refugees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those refugees are among more than 15,000 Hmong leaving a temple compound in Thailand. They will join thousands of Hmong already in the United States &mdash; including 46,000 in Wisconsin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hmong &mdash; an ethnic minority who helped the CIA in Laos during the Vietnam War &mdash; have come here as political refugees out of fear of retribution following the communist takeover in their homeland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thomas Thao, who came from Laos 25 years ago, will house his adult nephew for a few months in Appleton. Thao worries his nephew and other refugees won&rsquo;t have enough food, clothes and furniture &mdash; and he doubts they know enough English to find jobs right away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re new to the country, you don&rsquo;t know what to do. You don&rsquo;t know how to drive a car, the rules of the United States,&rdquo; Thao said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard life.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				An array of public and private agencies are preparing for the refugees, about a third of whom are headed to Milwaukee. The agencies were told many have little schooling and money and suffer from malnutrition and mental health problems. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The refugees will get $400 stipends from the federal government. Some families also will be eligible for Wisconsin&rsquo;s welfare-to-work program, which provides up to $673 in cash assistance for a limited period, and also food stamps and medical assistance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of particular concern to some is whether the state has enough W-2 money. That&rsquo;s the case in La Crosse County, which could end 2005 with a shortfall of up to $600,000 in its already strapped W-2 benefits program after more than 250 refugees arrive, said human services director Jerry Huber. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said officials may have to use local tax dollars usually spent on such things as law enforcement and parks to help cover costs. He acknowledged that could anger some residents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to make sure we have a positive community reception to the Hmong refugees,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Workforce Development Secretary Roberta Gassman said her department was working with state W-2 agencies to ensure they have enough money, in part by moving people into jobs faster. Her agency also may have to tap some unallocated money for W-2. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Gassman, whose agency oversees W-2 and refugee resettlement, said the federal government needs to provide more aid, given the resettlement is a federal initiative. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some senators, including Wisconsin&rsquo;s Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, are pushing for more federal resettlement money. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The senators say the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement does not have enough money to adequately resettle the Hmong, as their pending arrival wasn&rsquo;t known when lawmakers agreed on its budget for fiscal 2004. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, the overall number of refugees is rising this year after plummeting after Sept. 11, 2001. The resettlement office&rsquo;s current budget, though, is $447.6 million, about $33 million less than last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kohl said he wasn&rsquo;t confident the federal government would find additional money. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are really, really scrambling for it. Moneys are hard to come by, especially when you have deficits like we have right now,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wisconsin faces a $10 million deficit in the two-year budget that ends mid-2005. The deficit does not include a $224 million shortfall in the medical assistance program, which lawmakers haven&rsquo;t addressed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state has applied for more than $1.7 million in refugee grants but has yet to get any response, Gassman said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wisconsin already was budgeted to receive $500,000 for refugee social services this year, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Denis Tucker, executive associate director of the La Crosse Area Hmong Mutual Assistance Association, thinks the budget concerns are overblown and may cause a backlash against the refugees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Resettlement services were organized after the first wave of Hmong refugees arrived in the 1970s, so that should ease the financial burden, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This wave of refugees has something earlier groups likely did not have, said Susan Gundlach, director of refugee and immigrant services for Lutheran Social Services of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, one of the resettlement agencies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;One of the blessings is they have relatives here who we&rsquo;re hoping can help them out,&rdquo; she said.
