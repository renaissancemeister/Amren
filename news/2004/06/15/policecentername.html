			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Kerry Burke, New York Daily News, Jun. 13 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The decision to name a new Police Athletic League center in South Jamaica, Queens, after a certain slain cop has stirred anger and resentment in the community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Edward Byrne Center does not yet bear the fallen officer&rsquo;s name, though the dedication ceremony took place a month ago. And if a group of community leaders and residents have their way, it never will. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason? Edward Byrne was white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The center is in the middle of an African-American community,&rdquo; said the Rev. Charles Norris of the Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church. &ldquo;It should be named for a slain African-American law enforcement officer.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Norris has led two protests outside the $40 million facility on Guy Brewer Blvd., calling on the Police Athletic League to drop the idea. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Byrne was a 22-year-old rookie cop when he was shot and killed in 1988 while sitting in a patrol car on 107th Ave. He was guarding a witness who was to testify against a murderous drug gang led by jailed crack kings Lorenzo (Fat Cat) Nichols and Howard (Pappy) Mason. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The NYPD called the slaying an assassination after an investigation determined that the murder was ordered from prison. Byrne has since become a kind of patron saint of a host of anti-drug and anti-crime campaigns. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His father, retired NYPD Lt. Matthew Byrne, was surprised to hear about local opposition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was a decision made by the PAL to name the center. They notified us, and we respect their decision,&rdquo; said Byrne, who declined further comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The head of the police union, Patrolmen&rsquo;s Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch, suggested the community groups were off base. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When Police Officer Byrne gave his life, he gave it for all of the community regardless of race,&rdquo; said Lynch. &ldquo;He should be remembered for that deed in the same way.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The four-story center was dedicated in a May 4 ceremony attended by Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, the longtime chairman of the PAL. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But protesters outside that day said the community was never part of the process. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was very disrespectful. They just totally ignored the community&rsquo;s wishes,&rdquo; said Betty Dopson, of the Committee to Eliminate Media Offensive to African People. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said Byrne&rsquo;s death &ldquo;was a tragedy . . . but there are heroes of color who are unrecognized.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Norris said he had a list of seven names of fallen black officers but would not divulge them till the PAL agreed to remove Byrne&rsquo;s name from the center. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is no plan to change the center&rsquo;s name because that would be an insult to the Byrne family,&rdquo; said PAL Executive Director John Ryan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But, he admitted, &ldquo;We could have done more in reaching out to the community.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ryan said there is a plan to erect a &ldquo;Wall of Fame&rdquo; within the center honoring officers of all colors who died in the line of duty in Queens.
