			<h1>
				<a href="https://www.parapundit.com/archives/002175.html#002175">Fifth of London Marriages Faked for Immigration</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Randall Parker, parapundit.com, Jun. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fake marriages are becoming very widely used to stay in the UK. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Up to a fifth of wedding ceremonies in London could be bogus, a senior registrar warned today. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Officials fear the government&rsquo;s drive on immigration has triggered a surge in fake marriages. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Mark Rimmer, service director for registrations of births, deaths and marriages, believes rising numbers of foreigners are organising the ceremonies in a desperate bid to stay in the UK. 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3794379.stm">Rimmer sounds fairly confident the number is high.</a> 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				&ldquo;You are looking at one in five marriages in London being bogus. 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/06/11/nwed11.xml">The marriages are being made by non-EU citizens to citizens of various European Union countries.</a> (<i>Daily Telegraph</i> free registration required) 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Fake marriages typically involve a partner from the European Union, usually a &ldquo;bride&rdquo; from Portugal, France or Holland, and someone from outside, primarily North Africa or Turkey. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Registrars say that they regularly see cases in which couples sit refusing to face each other and flinch when they kiss. In one case when a bride was asked the name of the man she wanted to marry she had to first read it out of the passport. 
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/06/10/nimmi10.xml">This comes on the heels of the claims of another government official that immigration may be far higher than the official numbers indicate.</a> (<i>Daily Telegraph</i> free registration required) 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Immigration could be running at six times higher than official figures, a Home Office official told a court yesterday. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Robert Owen said he could not even &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; the true number of foreign nationals living in Britain. 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<a href="https://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=3053499">The Manchester Chinese community is 6 times larger than official estimates.</a> 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Called to the trial to give an overview of the situation he claimed that up to 1,000 people a day were at one time arriving at Heathrow&rsquo;s Terminal 3 claiming asylum. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				He also claimed that the Chinese community in Manchester put the true number of people from China living in the city at up to 50,000 more than six times official estimates. 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Britain is fortunate in one respect as compared to the United States: The British elites feel so pressured by an angry populace that the government&rsquo;s official position now is that immigration has to be reduced. America&rsquo;s elite continues to defy the wishes of the majority and to work toward increasing the immigrant flow into the United States. An example of this is the AgJobs amnesty which now has 62 sponsors in the US Senate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The United States needs a new political party. In Britain the UK Independence Party shows signs of becoming a contender that can threaten the existing status quo. Given that the Republican leaders have decided to be just as traitorous as the Democrats we desperately need a new political party.
