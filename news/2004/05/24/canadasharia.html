				Women fighting use of Islamic law, but backers say rights protected 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Lynda Hurst, Toronto Star, May 22</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Had she stayed in Iran, Homa Arjomand would now be dead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All &mdash; all &mdash; of the women&rsquo;s activists she worked with in Tehran have been executed, victims of a reactionary regime that ruled, and continues to rule, by strict adherence to Islam&rsquo;s sharia law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1989, she and her husband paid $15,000 to smugglers to help them and their two young children flee the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For three days, they rode on horseback through the mountains, sleeping in barns before finally reaching Turkey. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two years later, the onetime professor of medical physics arrived in Canada as a refugee. And how grateful she was to be in a secular country, where female equality was the law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That was then. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last fall, Arjomand, now a transitional counsellor in Toronto for immigrant women, heard the province had quietly approved the use of Islamic law in Ontario&rsquo;s Muslim community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A group she&rsquo;d never heard of, called the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice, had gained the right to hold tribunals, <i>darul qada</i>, in which marriage, family and business disputes can be settled according to sharia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 1,300-year-old body of laws and rules for living was inspired by the Qur&rsquo;an, Islam&rsquo;s holy book. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arjomand was horrified. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The last thing I expected in Canada, the last thing I want, is sharia law,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Women are not equal under it, therefore it is opposed to Canada&rsquo;s laws and values. The government can&rsquo;t let this happen.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government has no intention of stopping it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslims can&rsquo;t be excluded from Ontario&rsquo;s 1991 Arbitration Act, which allows religious groups to resolve family disputes, says the attorney-general&rsquo;s office. Hassidic Jews have been running their own Beit Din arbitrations based on Jewish law for years. Catholics, too, even Ismaili Muslims. Rulings are binding, but must be consistent with Canadian laws and the Charter of Rights. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There are safeguards built into the act,&rdquo; says Brendan Crawley, the attorney-general&rsquo;s spokesperson, who has been fielding calls from the world&rsquo;s press on the unprecedented decision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Participation must be voluntary by both parties and there is recourse if a decision doesn&rsquo;t abide by Canadian law. They can appeal to the courts.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arjomand has heard all this and doesn&rsquo;t buy a word of it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now head of the new International Campaign To Stop Sharia Courts in Canada, she and representatives from several concerned groups met last month with senior staff at the attorney-general&rsquo;s office and with Sandra Pupatello, the minister responsible for women&rsquo;s issues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arjomand told them flatly that under the guise of protecting religious freedom and multiculturalism &mdash; the fear, perhaps, of offending the Muslim community&rsquo;s male leadership &mdash; they were about to let the rights of Canadian Muslim women be trampled on. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most at risk are young immigrants, said Arjomand, who come from the Middle East or North Africa, where sharia is the law and has been used to subjugate them their entire lives. They know nothing different. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that sharia tribunals are to operate here, she says, many women will be socially and psychologically coerced into participating. To refuse would mean rejection by their families and the community &mdash; or worse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In a straight disagreement between a husband and wife, the husband&rsquo;s testimony will prevail. That is sharia. Even those women who know they can appeal will not challenge an arbitration decision for fear of the consequences.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite what the attorney-general&rsquo;s office blithely assumes, she says, it&rsquo;s unlikely decisions contrary to Canadian law will ever show up before the courts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sharia-approved but illegal activities already occur in Toronto, and she fears this will give strength to them. Muslim women are battered but don&rsquo;t dare report it. Bigamous marriages occur. Among her clients are two 14-year-old girls who were married last year to older men, in defiance of Ontario law prohibiting marriage before age 16. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is child abuse, sexual abuse,&rdquo; Arjomand says scathingly. &ldquo;These girls were born in Canada. I want to tell them to leave and get them into group homes, but if they do they&rsquo;ll be disavowed and isolated.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a May 7 letter to Arjomand, John Gregory, general counsel to the attorney-general, acknowledged &ldquo;the oppression that some Muslim women experience in Canada.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But that was not reason to deny the Islamic Institute the right to use the Arbitration Act. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The family or community pressure that prevents (a woman) from going to court to dispute an arbitration seems likely to prevent her from going to court to assert her legal rights even without an arbitration.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, he added, &ldquo;you may be asking us to find a legal remedy for what is mainly a cultural or possibly religious problem. So far it is not clear to us what legal remedy would be effective and constitutional.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arjomand is now meeting with lawyers to see if they can find a remedy. A campaign Web site petition to halt the tribunals before they begin has already collected 2,056 names. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alia Hogben, Indian-born president of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, says she got the same &ldquo;nothing we can do&rdquo; response after meeting with Gregory. And a council letter to Premier Dalton McGuinty was &ldquo;sloughed off.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve consulted scholars and they tell us we can&rsquo;t accept this,&rdquo; says the retired social worker. &ldquo;Everyone in the world is looking at Canada. A precedent can&rsquo;t be set. We can&rsquo;t give in.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hogben dismisses the province&rsquo;s claim that Ismaili Muslims (followers of the Aga Khan) have used private arbitration for years without problem and therefore why shouldn&rsquo;t the rest of the community. As she dryly points out, &ldquo;Ismailis don&rsquo;t use the sharia in their arbitrations.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The women&rsquo;s council&rsquo;s 900 members come from all Islamic sects: Shia, Sunni, Sufi, Wahhabi, Somali and Ismaili. &ldquo;It is difficult for us to speak out because we are practising, pro-faith Muslims who don&rsquo;t want to provide ammunition to those who malign Islam.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But they feel they must, she says, because the equality of the sexes espoused by the Qur&rsquo;an is not reflected in the sharia &mdash; the laws that evolved over 200 years following the death of Mohammad in 632 AD.
