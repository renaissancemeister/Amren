				Many illegal immigrants detained in a Watts raid last month have been let go or fear retaliation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Solomon Moore, L. A. Times, May 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly a month after authorities discovered 110 illegal immigrants held in a so-called safe house in Watts, federal officials have been unable to build a case against the alleged smugglers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of a shortage of detention space, all but a few of the 88 immigrants apprehended have been released from custody. Some of the immigrants refused to cooperate with investigators out of fear the smugglers might take revenge on them or their families, officials said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal prosecutors ultimately dropped smuggling charges against the three alleged &ldquo;coyotes,&rdquo; because the government did not comply with a judge&rsquo;s order to make the immigrants available to defense attorneys. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal officials said they could not meet the judge&rsquo;s demand because they were overwhelmed by the number migrants recovered from the house and could not process them through the system within the 48 hours required by the law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It just wasn&rsquo;t so easy,&rdquo; said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration officials generally detain illegal immigrants with serious felony records until their deportation hearings. But immigrants detained in sweeps such as the Watts raid are routinely released on bond with a notice to appear at a future deportation hearing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to federal statistics, half of all such detainees released in this manner fail to show up for the court proceedings. This often makes it harder for officials to prosecute the smugglers.
