			<h1>
				Racial Tensions Boil Over at Hamtramck High School
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>ClickOnDetroit.com, May 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The superintendent of Hamtramck schools promised that, after a fight between high-school students Thursday, there will be a police presence at the school for the remainder of the year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are hoping that we can move toward solidarity. We are going to have police protection for the school and for the rest of the year,&rdquo; said Janet Guggenheim, superintendent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Racial tensions boiled over Thursday after a fight broke out between African-American students and Arab-American students, according to police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hamtramck Police Detective Jacqueline Crachiola said a group of African-American girls were walking to their classrooms and were &ldquo;jumped&rdquo; by a group of Arab-American boys. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At least seven students were involved and suspended, including one girl who said she received a bloody nose from one of the boys. 
			</p>
			<p>
				School administrators said the fight was a continuation of an altercation that began Wednesday night away from school property. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After hearing the news of the fights, some parents went to the school Thursday and picked up their children. The students that remained had to be escorted to classes and some ate lunch in classrooms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After school, a parent was arrested and handcuffed after he and his son reportedly got into an altercation with some students who were making comments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They had words back and forth. He and his sons proceeded to go after some of the kids who were saying things. We were told he had a box cutter in his pocket and he did,&rdquo; said Crachiola. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many parents don&rsquo;t know how the ongoing feud began, but they do know that it&rsquo;s been going on for years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take everyone for attitudes to change,&rdquo; said Guggenheim.
