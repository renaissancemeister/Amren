			<h1>
				Bill Would Allow Deportation Of People With Foreign IDs
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i> Lisa Friedman, Los Angeles Daily News, May 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; Presenting a foreign-issued identification card to federal authorities would be reason enough for deportation under legislation Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced Friday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill represents Gallegly&rsquo;s latest effort to restrict the Mexican &ldquo;matricula consular&rdquo; cards that are issued by the thousands each month in Los Angeles alone, and which local governments increasingly accept as a valid form of ID. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By amending the Immigration and Naturalization Act, Gallegly also would bar any illegal immigrant who was deported for using a foreign identification card from re-entering the U.S. for 10 years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It would mean a federal agency could not accept this as a form of identification,&rdquo; Gallegly said. &ldquo;Clearly, the only person that needs this card is someone who is here illegally in the United States.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While groups that work against illegal immigration praised Gallegly&rsquo;s bill, the National Immigration Law Center called it &ldquo;an outrageous proposal.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very draconian and punitive and arbitrary,&rdquo; said Linton Joaquin, the center&rsquo;s interim executive director based in Los Angeles. &ldquo;I question whether it&rsquo;s legal.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Joaquin also challenged the assumption that presenting a matricula card necessarily means one is in the U.S. illegally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the legislation, presenting a consular identification card &ldquo;shall be prima facie evidence that the alien is deportable.&rdquo; The immigrant would have to prove that he or she is in the country legally and should not be deported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill does not impose any requirements upon federal officials or others who may be presented with a matricula card to turn someone over for deportation. But, Gallegly said, &ldquo;it sends up a red flag that would cause authorities to check your immigration status.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike Hethman, staff counsel for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based group that works to block illegal immigration, called the bill &ldquo;very helpful.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It will cut off the burgeoning practice of local and state governments defying the federal government over immigration policy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Congress has in the past approved modest measures overseeing the use of matricula cards, including one by Gallegly demanding Mexico share its database of card holders with the U.S. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Previous efforts to restrict the card, however, have gone nowhere. Last year, Gallegly introduced a bill that would have prohibited the federal government from recognizing all foreign-issued identification cards except passports.
