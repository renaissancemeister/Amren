				<a href="http://www.parapundit.com/archives/002109.html#002109">Immigrants Do Not Improve Academically In Later Generations</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Randall Parker, parapundit.com, May 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A recent study done at UCLA is reported in a press release that purports to be relaying good news but which is actually reporting very bad news. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute researchers find high school graduates from immigrant families succeed in college at similar rates as American-born peers with similar economic and ethnic backgrounds. Students from immigrant families also are more likely to support their families while in school. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				In addition, high school graduates from immigrant families with higher incomes and higher levels of parent education achieved the highest success in college. This finding helps to explain lower levels of success seen among Latin American children compared with East Asian children. 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Oh what nonsense. Is the higher income level of the parents the cause of higher academic achievement? Where is the evidence for that? The academic success and economic success are obviously both flowing from other factors. Smart Indian and Chinese immigrant engineers are having smart kids. How can anyone seriously doubt that engineers have innately much smarter kids on average than grade school drop-outs? We are supposed to attribute the differences in educational attainment to economic factors? How loony. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Appearing in the summer edition of the peer-reviewed Journal of Research on Adolescence, the study is among the first to examine the success of immigrant children in post-secondary education. The William T. Grant Foundation and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded the research. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				&ldquo;The United States has experienced a tremendous wave of immigration over the past 30 years. The ability of the children of immigrants to find educational success beyond high school is critical to their economic integration into American society,&rdquo; said Dr. Andrew J. Fuligni, the paper&rsquo;s co-author and senior research scientist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute&rsquo;s Center for Culture and Health. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<b>&ldquo;Our overall findings are encouraging,&rdquo;</b> he said. 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>No Dr. Fuligni, your overall findings are highly discouraging.</b> If the first generation of an ethnic group does just as well academically as later generations but that ethnic group&rsquo;s first generation does poorly in school then that is bad news. <b>There is no sign of an improving trend that will make things all work out well in the long run.</b> Here is clear evidence that contrary to the myth promoted by many neoconservatives and liberals not all immigration is wonderful. Here is evidence which shows a permanent problem is being created. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				&ldquo;But there are signs that certain segments of the immigrant population, particularly those from Latin America, need more assistance to participate fully in educational and related economic opportunities available in the United States.&rdquo; 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Well, duh. That is politically correct way of saying that Hispanic immigrants academically do far worse on average than whites and East Asians. This is spun into a politically correct phrasing that there is a problem here that can be solved with &ldquo;more assistance&rdquo;. Where is the empirical evidence that some form of assistance exists that would work? The empirical studies of changes in spending per student show little or no beneficial effect. So what variable would the academics recommend turning to provide the assistance that will close the achievement gap? 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UCLA report inadvertently confirms the bad news I drew attention to in my previous post <a href="http://www.parapundit.com/archives/001952.html">Samuel P. Huntington Comes Out Against Immigration From Mexico</a> on Huntington&rsquo;s article in <i>Foreign Policy</i> which includes a table which shows <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2495&amp;page=9">little improvement in education attainment across generations of Mexican immigrants.</a>

				This bad news reminds me of the great <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22States+with+higher+IQ+vote+Democrat%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">&ldquo;States with higher IQ vote Democrat&rdquo;</a> hoax. In reflecting on this hoax Steve Sailer sees evidence in the NAEP test results that <a href="http://www.isteve.com/Web_Exclusives_Archive-May2004.htm#38115.6465670139">California and the nation as a whole have a dumber future.</a> 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<b>The future looks dumberer  &mdash; </b> Looking at the NAEP scores for public school 8th graders by state (see <a href="http://www.isteve.com/Web_Exclusives_Archive-May2004.htm#NAEP%20Reading">below</a>), it struck me that California is a going to be, on average, a much dumber state in the future than it is now. I always thought of it as a pretty smart state, what with Silicon Valley, Cal Tech, and aerospace. Even Hollywood attracts a lot of smart cookies. In the past, these smarts were spread pretty broadly through the general populace in California. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<b>But California&rsquo;s 2003 NAEP scores for public schools 8th graders are awful: 44th out of 50 states in Math</b> (behind states like Tennessee and Nevada, a state where the study of probability is the only socially sanctioned intellectual pursuit) and <b>49th</b> in Reading (well behind <i>Mississippi</i>). If California is the pacesetter state, with its 25 year head start on absorbing immigrants, then the future looks dumber for all of us. 
			</blockquote>

				Click through to Steve&rsquo;s link and look down from that post through his earlier posts where he explodes <a href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~gcharter/iq.txt">the hoax table underlying the &ldquo;liberal Democrats have higher IQs&rdquo; myth</a> which suckered in so many left-liberal blog. The claim made by that table is that the states that voted for Al Gore in 2000 have higher average IQs than the states that voted for George W. Bush. Liberals who deny that IQ matters were ready to stampede to report the news when it looked like Democrats are smarter than Republicans. But since they never actually bother to read the details of the psychometric studies that they denounce their ignorance of the facts made them suckers for an <i>obvious</i> hoax. I mean it was <i>glaring</i>. It put Utah at an IQ of 87. How <i>absurd</i>. Utah has above average 8th grade National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores in spite of spending less per student than all states except North Dakota. North Dakota, which went for Bush, is top of the pops for NAEP 8th grade math scores. So money matters for educational outcomes? Ha. I got a bridge to sell to anyone who believes that. By contrast, Washington DC spends about 3 times as much as Utah and yet manages to score at the bottom of the barrel in NAEP scores. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The way liberals react to fake IQ data that supports their prejudices demonstrates they obviously understand that IQ matters and that it matters a lot. Inconveniently the <i>real</i> evidence about IQs just doesn&rsquo;t support either liberal or neoconservative mythology about an assortment of policy topics such as education, immigration, and nation-building. We ignore the evidence at our peril.
