				Harare Shuns Aid in Face of Famine Alert
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jan Raath, Times (UK), ZWNews.com, May 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite warnings of a third successive year of famine, a government spokesman in Zimbabwe said yesterday that the country&rsquo;s food stocks were sufficient and it would not require relief aid from international agencies. State radio quoted Paul Mangwana, the Minister of Social Welfare, as saying that the Government had &ldquo;ruled out food imports or receiving aid &hellip;because the country has produced enough food for its requirements.&rdquo; He said that the Government had already informed Western donor agencies, which would be allowed to continue providing food on a much smaller scale. The Government claims that 1.7 million tonnes will be produced, but international experts have dismissed the forecast and say that nearly all the conditions for the alleged &ldquo;bumper harvest&rdquo; are absent. &ldquo;Mangwana is absolutely lying,&rdquo; Archbishop Pius Ncube, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s most outspoken Catholic cleric, said. &ldquo;Last year 10,000 people died of hunger, and a quarter of a million more would have died if it were not for food aid.&rdquo;

			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>iol (SA), May 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Harare &mdash; Zimbabwe will produce 2.4 million tons of maize this year, much more than it needs, a final government crop estimate has shown, state media said on Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s government has told international donors that it will not require emergency food aid for the first time in three years after the bumper harvest, although farmers and aid agencies were sceptical of the new figures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Agriculture Minister Joseph Made said this year&rsquo;s maize harvest would surpass the country&rsquo;s annual requirement of between 1.5 million and two million tons thanks to above-normal rainfall, the state owned Herald newspaper said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Made said results from the final crop assessment for the 2003/2004 season showed that 2 431 182 tons of maize would be produced this season,&rdquo; the newspaper said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbabwe has battled food shortages since 2001, which aid agencies blame mainly on disruptions to agriculture linked to the seizure of white-owned commercial farms to resettle landless blacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Herald quoted Made as saying that the land reform programme had enabled new black farmers to show that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s agricultural productivity was far higher than had been assumed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The country&rsquo;s average annual maize production has been at around 1.3 million tonnes over the past five years, although it fell sharply during 2001/02. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), which represents many of the remaining white farmers in the country, was sceptical about the new government forecast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We think the crop will be similar to last year which is around 700 000 tons. We don&rsquo;t know where these figures are coming from,&rdquo; CFU President Doug Taylor-Freeme said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Even the seed that was sold does not add up to that (output),&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last week Zimbabwe officials abruptly cancelled crop assessment missions by the United Nations World Food Programme and Food and Agriculture Organisation, which officials had hoped would deliver a clearer picture of the country&rsquo;s grain balance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Made said if sorghum and millet were included, the country&rsquo;s grain output would total 2.8 million tons, of which 1.2 million tons would be delivered to the state-run Grain Marketing Board. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbabwe suffered from severe food shortages in 2002 and 2003, affecting up to seven million people, and recently international aid agencies have estimated that the country might face a shortfall of as much as 900 000 tons of maize this year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Made was not reachable for comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zimbabwe&rsquo;s food crisis has been one sign of an economic crisis that has also brought acute shortages of foreign currency and fuel, one of the highest rates of inflation in the world and an unemployment rate of over 70 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics blame the crisis on mismanagement by Mugabe but the veteran leader denies the charge, and in turn accuses opponents of his land reforms of sabotaging the economy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government says Zimbabwe&rsquo;s food shortages were largely a result of drought, and that land redistribution was necessary to correct colonial imbalances that left the bulk of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s prime farming land in the hands of minority whites.
