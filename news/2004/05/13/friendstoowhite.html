				&lsquo;Friends&rsquo; So White It Hurt To Watch
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Mike Seate, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, May 13 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tonight will be an evening of withdrawal across the nation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For nine television seasons, millions of viewers have spent their Thursday evenings immersed in a fantasy world where everyone is cute, thin, witty and more than a little quirky. Oh yeah, and white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That was the New York City seen in the beloved situation comedy &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; which ended in a virtual whiteout last week. Obviously, few people cared that the show&rsquo;s New York looked like a Woolworth&rsquo;s lunch counter in Mississippi circa 1962. About 52.5 million viewers tuned in to the &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; finale, prompting one question: Whose friends, particularly in a place as diverse as New York, look like this, anyway? 
			</p>
			<p>
				It doesn&rsquo;t take a course in White Folks&rsquo; TV Fantasies 101 to understand some of the appeal of the show that managed to include only one substantial African-American character in 236 episodes. It&rsquo;s sort of like the old racist joke about the animated series &ldquo;The Jetsons&rdquo; that ends by asking a viewer to name the black character on the show. Answer: There isn&rsquo;t one &mdash; meaning that the future, as represented on &ldquo;The Jetsons,&rdquo; is bright because it&rsquo;s white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We can forgive George, Jane, Judy and Elroy their segregated &lsquo;hood. It&rsquo;s a cartoon, after all. &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; on the other hand, is set in Manhattan, one of the most racially diverse areas on the planet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				TV shows used to seduce viewers with fantasies involving perfect suburban communities (&ldquo;Leave it to Beaver&rdquo;), wealth (&ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;) and getting away with keeping an attractive female slave who possesses supernatural powers (&ldquo;I Dream of Jeannie&rdquo;). The creators of &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; waved their magic racial wand and made all of New York&rsquo;s Dominicans, its Hmong, its Portuguese, its Asians and its Latinos disappear faster than you can say <i>Aryan ratings sweep.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even with the enormous talents of the Hollywood special effects machine, that&rsquo;s no easy task, especially if you study the Big Apple&rsquo;s latest census. The 2000 U.S. Census shows that 24.5 percent of New York&rsquo;s 8,008,278 residents are black, 35 percent are Hispanic and 10 percent are divided among other minority backgrounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Somehow, the folks at NBC were able to air a show for a decade where seldom, if ever, did the cast meet, do business with, take a cab ride from or even buy a barbecued chicken, egg roll or tortilla from an actor or actress representing that nearly 70 percent of New York&rsquo;s population. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No one is suggesting that the program&rsquo;s lousy casting makes the tens of millions of Americans who watched it racist. Some of the viewers, I&rsquo;m told, are minorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whoever they are, they apparently expected very little from TV.
