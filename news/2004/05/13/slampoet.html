			<h1>
				Slam Poet Stirs Up The U.S. Melting Pot
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jack Zink, Sun-Sentinel.com, May 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				New York &mdash; Sarah Jones is a slam poet who has collected the voices within her head and turned them into a repertory company. Her current one-woman show, Bridge &amp; Tunnel, is a roller coaster of comedy, poignancy and drama. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The off-Broadway showcase at a 300-seat downtown theater is her fourth full-length monologue in a string that&rsquo;s generated a buzz from San Francisco to Washington,s D.C. Not since Lily Tomlin has a performer so compellingly depicted the ingredients of America&rsquo;s melting pot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones&rsquo; subjects are all immigrants in contemporary New York, telling us of their dreams and frustrations at an annual poetry reading organized by a good-natured Pakistani emcee. Tony Taccone directs, which must be like sitting on a buckboard holding the reins of an unbroken stallion as Jones whips through more than a dozen very different characters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The stage is a 12-inch-high platform at one end of a cafeteria-sized venue, facing an audience on stack chairs loaded onto risers. Jones works the ringsiders and, at one point, takes a seat in the middle of the room to portray an elderly Russian crank. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The setting is a caf&eacute; in South Queens. A homeless black woman is the usher who delivers the opening speech about candy wrappers and cell phone behavior, with a few asides about the economic divide she&rsquo;s facing. An elderly Polish Jew remembers how her people were branded outsiders and troublemakers, the same as the Hispanics she&rsquo;s talking to today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A young Vietnamese-American spews frustration and rage at the WASP elite, while a Mexican who lost his legs pines over an even greater tragedy: the fianc&eacute;e who died while trying to cross the border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Emcee Mohammed Ali is an accountant and a 27-year U.S. resident, with the delusion that he&rsquo;s a polished host. In between his awkward introductions, he&rsquo;s on the phone worried about the immigration service&rsquo;s sudden interest in him and his wife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are no specific connecting links in their stories, but Jones&rsquo; choice of topical material builds a vivid panorama of the cultural pot in mid-melt. In the face of constant harangues that the monodrama is a dead-end art form, artists like her keep finding ways to prove its vitality.
