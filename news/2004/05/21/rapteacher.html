			<h1>
				Teacher Apologizes For Profane Rapping In Class
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>News4Jax.com, May 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				JACKSONVILLE, Fla. &mdash; A Jacksonville middle school teacher who was removed for profane rapping during class apologized and said he&rsquo;s worried about the reputation of his school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				David Ross (pictured, left) was removed from his teaching position at Northwestern Middle School after a parent saw a tape of several students rapping, using profanity and racial slurs &mdash; and the teacher was participating. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, Ross is waiting for word from the school staff about his job in the Duval County school system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I do want to say to my students, to the staff at Northwestern, to all the people who have supported me, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While rapping about things like sex and drugs, and using racial epithets, Ross&rsquo; students cheered him on and even joined in. Ross said he did it to relate to his students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you watch MTV today, which these kids watch, which I&rsquo;ve watched, you see battle rapping back and forth,&rdquo; Ross explained. &ldquo;Is it condonable? No, it was all me. A lapse in judgment &mdash; that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ross said he now realizes that lapse may have cost him his job. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to make a defense for myself right now,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>

			</table>
			<p>
				As for School Board investigator John Williams, who&rsquo;s looking into Ross&rsquo; case, his reaction to the tape is one of disappointment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The teacher is not behaving like a teacher,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The teacher is behaving like someone out on the street corner.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Williams is now waiting to review the entire 2-hour tape before making a recommendation to Superintendent John Fryer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ross, who remains on paid leave from the school, said he&rsquo;s been teaching there for three years and has never had any trouble.
