			<h1>
				Amendment Calls For Troops Along Border
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Angeles Negrete Lares, The Brownsville Herald, May 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. House on Wednesday passed an amendment to a defense bill that would place soldiers along the nation&rsquo;s borders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The amendment, submitted by U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., is part of the National Defense Authorization Act designed to bolster national security by providing more aircraft, missiles, missile defense systems and personnel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill &mdash; House Resolution 4200 &mdash; will be negotiated in House and Senate committees to determine further details, including whether soldiers would be placed at both the northern and southern borders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, opposes the amendment, calling it an &ldquo;insult&rdquo; to border communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We already have personnel to take care of our borders,&rdquo; Ortiz said, referring to Border Patrol agents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Soldiers are trained to kill. They&rsquo;re trained to kill the enemy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1997, two armed civilians were shot by troops stationed near the Texas-Mexico border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of them &mdash; 18-year-old Esequiel Hernandez Jr. &mdash; was killed near his home in Redford by a Marine who claimed Hernandez had threatened him with a rifle. Later that year, Cesario Vasquez, 30, was wounded when he stumbled upon a U.S. Army Special Forces unit hidden in the brush near Brownsville during a low-profile military operation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Violent episodes such as these would become more common if soldiers were placed along the U.S.-Mexico border, said U.S. Rep. Ciro D. Rodriguez, D-San Antonio, chairman for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Once again Republicans are attempting to use the men and women of our armed services to promote an anti-immigrant agenda,&rdquo; Rodriguez said. &ldquo;We all agree that we need to find ways to secure our borders, but immigrants from Mexico and Canada are not our enemy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our troops are already over-extended serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are continuously hearing reports that they need more resources and more manpower to fulfill their duties.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Goode&rsquo;s amendment, originally introduced on Jan. 1, 2003, was passed by the House but failed to garner support in the Senate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He resubmitted the amendment in March, and the House passed it Wednesday 231-189. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigrant rights advocates hope the Senate once again opposes the amendment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think (placing troops along the border) jeopardizes the safety and human rights of the civilians,&rdquo; said Nathan Selzer, director of the Valley Movement for Human Rights, an immigrant rights group in Harlingen. &ldquo;Once again, some lawmakers are using the mentality of war and making the migrant the enemy of the United States.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				With fears of terrorism on the rise, the Federation for American Immigration Reform supports the amendment to the defense bill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If Congress can&rsquo;t muster the political will to protect public from those who wish to do us harm, they might as well pack their bags and head home,&rdquo; said FAIR spokesman David Ray.

				House Oks Bill To Let U.S. Soldiers Guard Border
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Sergio Bustos, El Paso Times, May 21 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; U.S. soldiers may be asked to keep undocumented immigrants and potential terrorists out of the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The House on Thursday passed a defense authorization bill, which includes a provision that would let U.S. troops join with U.S. Border Patrol agents in guarding the nation&rsquo;s borders with Canada and Mexico. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill authorizes Defense Department programs for the coming fiscal year, which will begin Oct. 1. The border troop amendment, championed by Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., passed the House late Wednesday by a 40-vote margin, 231-191. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The provision stands little chance of surviving beyond the House because it was not part of the Senate&rsquo;s version of the defense bill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If troops were needed, they could be of significant assistance to prevent the infiltration of terrorists, drug traffickers, and illegal aliens, and could prevent the entry of weapons of mass destruction into our country,&rdquo; Goode said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, who spent 26 years with the U.S. Border Patrol and opposed the amendment, said it was &ldquo;simply the wrong solution to our current problems along the border.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This amendment will send our military personnel to our borders at a time when they are already stretched thin in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, Kosovo, Bosnia and over 100 other countries around the world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We cannot and we should not ask our military personnel to patrol our borders.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Southern Arizona lawmakers whose districts run along the U.S.-Mexico border echoed Reyes&rsquo; argument. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Border security is and continues to be a top priority for me and for the Congress as a whole,&rdquo; said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Tucson. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But the Goode amendment would militarize our border and stretch the resources of our Army.&rdquo;
