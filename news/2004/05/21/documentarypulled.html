				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3733215.stm">Documentary Pulled Over Race Fear</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, May 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Channel 4 has pulled a documentary about social workers in Bradford from its schedule after police warned it could increase racial tension. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to be broadcast on Thursday, Edge of the City followed social workers and clients, including young white girls who had been abused by Asian men. 
			</p>
			<p>
				West Yorkshire Police feared it would increase community tension in Bradford ahead of local and European elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The channel said it would show the &ldquo;important&rdquo; programme at a later date. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Grooming </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Filmed over the course of a year with the co-operation of Bradford Social Services, Edge of the City focused on &ldquo;the darker side of urban life in Britain&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These are the neighbours we don&rsquo;t want to know whose problems we don&rsquo;t want to see,&rdquo; read the show&rsquo;s publicity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As well as following a young offender, a &ldquo;fiercely independent&rdquo; elderly man and a disabled couple, the documentary examined the area of child abuse known as &ldquo;grooming&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It reported that white girls as young as 11 were being sexually abused by Asian men who encouraged their dependency on drugs over a period of time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In July 2001 Bradford was the scene of some of the worst race riots Britain has seen for 20 years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				West Yorkshire Police said 326 officers were injured during the disturbances, leading to two stabbings, 219 arrests and an estimated &pound;27m worth of damage. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Public disorder&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Channel 4 said police feared the new documentary &ldquo;would increase community tensions in Bradford&rdquo; ahead of elections on 10 June, &ldquo;with the risk that it would lead to public disorder&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In these exceptional circumstances, and based on the police&rsquo;s risk assessment on the ground, Channel 4 as a responsible broadcaster has agreed to the police&rsquo;s request to postpone the broadcast until a later date,&rdquo; the channel said in a statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Channel 4 believes Edge of the City is an important, well-researched and produced documentary film. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is in the public interest that this film be shown and we will be broadcasting it later in the year.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The documentary was replaced on Thursday with a repeated episode of Faking It.
