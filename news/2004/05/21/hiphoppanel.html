			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				A symposium in Miami Beach brought together the hip-hop community, police and academic experts to debate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Evelyn McDonnell And Casey Woods, MiamiHerald.com, May 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				With rapper Luther Campbell, Miami Police Chief John Timoney and Harvard professor Marcyliena Morgan sharing the stage, the hip-hop symposium Friday at the Miami Beach Convention Center provided a rare cultural mix. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The event, sparked by a Herald story that detailed how Miami and Miami Beach police keep tabs on hip-hop artists and their entourages, was a gathering of representatives from communities that rarely have reason to sit down in the same room. In front of about 70 people, they argued about the complex and controversial issues dividing rappers and police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The whole day was a success, because we were able to get together people who on a day-to-day basis don&rsquo;t come in contact with each other,&rdquo; said Henry Crespo, chairman of the Miami Beach Black Host Committee, a cosponsor of the event. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eleven panelists spoke about the relationship between the police and the hip-hop community. They answered written questions submitted to the moderator that referred to revelations in the March 9 article, including surveillance of hip-hop stars and the existence of a six-inch-thick binder on rappers and their associates that was prepared by New York police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>CONSTRUCTIVE TALK</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				On many fronts, the panel seemed to accomplish what its organizers hoped it would by generating dialogue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But, at times, the panel showed a cultural divide between law enforcement and members of the hip-hop community, with several heated exchanges over flash points such as the binder and the so-called East Coast-West Coast rap wars. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sparks flew when David Mays, publisher of the hip-hop magazine The Source, challenged Timoney on his department&rsquo;s possession of the binder. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mays also took issue with Timoney&rsquo;s statement that an East Coast-West Coast rivalry was responsible for &rdquo;bodies&rdquo; in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Mays blamed those bodies on oppressive conditions in America&rsquo;s inner cities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Acknowledging the damage the binder has done to Miami&rsquo;s image, Timoney said he planned to burn it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Campbell also criticized the makeup of the Miami Beach Black Host Committee. He complained that the panel lacked representatives of the hip-hop community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Crespo defended the committee. &rdquo;We&rsquo;re more than hip-hop here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re more than one dimension.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier, behind closed doors, cops heard academic specialists explain hip-hop concepts, along with discussions of other issues, among them how police are depicted in rap lyrics. The seminar for law enforcement officers was attended by 75 officers from the Miami, Miami-Dade, West Palm Beach and Miami Beach police departments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>CHANCE TO LEARN</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was some of the best training we&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; Miami Beach police Chief Donald De Lucca said. &ldquo;It made me feel like we&rsquo;ve just scratched the surface on things we can learn about this culture.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While many of those in attendance from the hip-hop industry applauded the concept of the symposium, some said it was long overdue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They should have done it a long time ago because if they had, the problems they had with the first Memorial Day weekend and that binder wouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary,&rdquo; Campbell said, referring to Memorial Day 2001, when city officials acknowledged being caught off-guard by hip-hop crowds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The hip-hop community is such a huge generator of revenue for Miami Beach and South Florida, and it should be understood.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While most participants applauded the symposium, some expressed concern that it would be only a one-time event. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This grew out of the need to be responsive to a problem,&rdquo; said panelist Cedric Muhammad, publisher of BlackElectorate.com. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. There&rsquo;s only something wrong if this was only for public relations and political benefit.&rdquo;
