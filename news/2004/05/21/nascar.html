				<b>Five drivers &mdash; four African-Americans and a woman &mdash; are racing on NASCAR weekly short tracks this year as part of the Drive for Diversity program. The program, in its first year, is being directed by Charlotte-based Access Marketing and supported by NASCAR and several corporate sponsors.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Allison Duncan, Bruce Driver, Joe Henderson, Morty Buckles and Reggie Primus were selected after a tryout held in January at Hickory Motor Speedway.</b>

			<p>
				<b>They were all at NASCAR&rsquo;s research and development center in Concord on Thursday to participate in a news conference at which former NBA star Magic Johnson was introduced as co-chairman of a new executive steering committee for diversity.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Before the news conference, Observer motorsports writer David Poole sat down with the five drivers to talk about the Drive for Diversity program and about some of their struggles as they&rsquo;ve tried to make a career in stock-car racing. Here are highlights of that round-table discussion:</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Clearly, this program helps each of you take a big step forward in your respective careers, doesn&rsquo;t it? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Allison Duncan: </b>I definitely think it&rsquo;s a huge step. I raced late models at Hickory Motor Speedway last year, but I had hardly any money. I was worried about being able to buy tires every week to go race. Now I am paired up with a great team like BH Motorsports, I have good people with me, I have sponsors like Miller Lite and Sunoco &mdash; that&rsquo;s all huge. That&rsquo;s pretty much any race car driver&rsquo;s dream to have that kind of support and go racing. You just have to worry about the driving part. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Bruce Driver: </b>With a program like this getting started, what it also does is bring more awareness to all of the other people who are in line who need to get into a program like this. For us, we&rsquo;re building the foundation of this program for the next group to line up, so they won&rsquo;t have to struggle as much. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For me, if this program wasn&rsquo;t available through my sponsors, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing anything this year. When you get into a program like this, you know the minimum number of races you&rsquo;re going to run is 18. If we can help lay the foundation, when the next class comes through they will have an opportunity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>If all goes well, this will be the first of many classes in this program. Is that an important part of how you&rsquo;re approaching it as well as advancing you own careers? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Joe Henderson: </b>Everything has to start off with a first. We have to take this program and move it along, to bring sponsors and people into NASCAR and get African Americans and young women interested. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Being in this program clearly will have benefits for each of you, but doesn&rsquo;t it also bring added responsibilities? You&rsquo;ll each be representing this program and the concept of diversity as much as you will be representing yourselves, your teams and your sponsors. </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Morty Buckles: </b>Every time I go onto the track I have to think about the National Guard, (team owner) Sam Belnavis and Belnavis Racing. But I also have to think about this entire program every single time I go out. With that does come a lot of responsibility, any time you&rsquo;re in the spotlight. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A lot of people look at what we&rsquo;re doing as some kind of a favorable position, but with that comes a lot of responsibility. But each one of us has earned the right to carry that responsibility on our shoulders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Duncan: </b>We know that all of our accomplishments will be highlighted a little bit more, and all of our struggles will be, too. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Some people might indeed say that you five have been &ldquo;given&rdquo; a huge break here. But there&rsquo;s no driver in motorsports, regardless of his or her background, who hasn&rsquo;t had a lot of help along the way. Is that the way you see it? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Reggie Primus: </b>As far as I am concerned, we&rsquo;ve all earned our way. I know, speaking from where I&rsquo;ve come from, I&rsquo;ve struggled on the local short tracks, beating and banging. I&rsquo;ve slept underneath my car working on them at night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The neighborhood I lived in didn&rsquo;t have red clay, but when I washed my cars my front yard looked like a dirt track. I&rsquo;ve been there. I am not going to say this is a &ldquo;gimme.&rdquo; We went through a test and we were picked. They didn&rsquo;t just pick us up off the street and say, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re a minority or a female. Come drive this car.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Have there been times when you&rsquo;ve let yourself feel like you didn&rsquo;t get a break or an opportunity based simply on the fact that you&rsquo;re not a white male? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Driver: </b>I think anybody with a competitive nature can feel that way. &ldquo;I should have been drafted by the Cowboys instead of the Eagles.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s always that way in all of professional sports and in the world. In a job, you might feel like you should be the head of the office and not the secretary. It would be wrong for us to single ourselves out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>How has the fan reaction been as you&rsquo;ve begun the season? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Duncan: </b>Nothing but support. I think everybody realizes that if NASCAR and all of these corporations are behind us, there&rsquo;s a reason that we&rsquo;re out there. Any race car driver &mdash; black or white, male or female &mdash; has to prove himself. It&rsquo;s just like Reggie said. We&rsquo;ve all been through it all. We&rsquo;ve paid our dues. We&rsquo;re here because we were chosen, and it&rsquo;s an incredible opportunity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Buckles: </b>One thing that helps you earn fan support is being competitive. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve had to demonstrate. We went to the combine and we&rsquo;ve all done it over the years, prove we&rsquo;re competitive. When you get out, the more you&rsquo;re out front the more you prove you&rsquo;re supposed to be there and the more fans understand what you&rsquo;re all about. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Henderson: </b>I want to go out and prove myself. Yes, I have Kodak as a sponsor and Bobby Hamilton supporting me. But I still can go out there and drive as hard as anybody else out there. I want people on the track to be able to trust that I can run with them side by side, that I am not just somebody who has been thrown out there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Had this been a hard dream for each of you to keep going? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Primus: </b>It depends on how long you want to struggle. As long as I had rice and beans and a roof over my head, I was going to keep racing. I&rsquo;ve sacrificed a lot. People ask me why I am not married, why I don&rsquo;t have kids. I was trying to race and didn&rsquo;t want to take anybody down with me while I was struggling, trying to make it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Driver: </b>You have to be totally committed to wanting to do this. This is your life. Friends are on vacation all summer and they ask you why you&rsquo;re not on vacation. I can&rsquo;t afford to take a vacation because I am trying to make a career for myself. I want to be a race car driver. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Duncan: </b>There&rsquo;s not a successful driver out there who can&rsquo;t tell you about the struggles and the sacrifices they&rsquo;ve made for years and years. It&rsquo;s tough, and it&rsquo;s frustrating. You think you have the perfect deal set up and, at the last minute, it falls through. That&rsquo;s just the way it is, you just have accept that and do the best you can. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Driver: </b>People might look at this and say, `You&rsquo;ve got sponsors like National Guard, Kodak, Sunoco, why are you struggling if you&rsquo;ve got that money.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re going to struggle in a new program, I don&rsquo;t care what kind of driver you are. You don&rsquo;t have the communication down with your team. You have to find out everybody&rsquo;s level of commitment. It will take a half-dozen races for everybody to get going, but I think you will see, once this is all said and done, you will see some big numbers from this group. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>You guys will likely have equipment that is as good or better than the people you&rsquo;ll run against this year. For most of you, it will be the first time you&rsquo;ve been able to say that. Does that put more pressure on you to perform well? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Buckles: </b>It does. It puts you on the spot. But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve all been asking for, to say we&rsquo;ve trained like Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson and the guys who&rsquo;re out there and we&rsquo;ve all said, &ldquo;If I could show up at the track with that good equipment, I could show what I can do.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re here now. This is the pressure we&rsquo;ve asked to carry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Duncan: </b>I like the pressure on me. I want it to be that I have to go out and lay down a good qualifying lap because I know I have a great car and great people working on the car. I know I have to perform. I want that kind of pressure on me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Have you ever been so discouraged that it seemed like you&rsquo;d had enough? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Driver: </b>Yes. But when I get to thinking that things are so bad, I have this stock-car magazine that&rsquo;s probably from like 1986. Wendell Scott is on the front of it with Richard Petty. I cherish that magazine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When I think things are bad, no lie, I get that magazine out and read Wendell&rsquo;s story. I shut the magazine and suddenly things aren&rsquo;t as bad as I though they were. For us right now, this is golden. For him, man. I am thankful that I got to talk to him three times before he passed away. That meant a lot to me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Is it possible for you to picture yourself on the cover of a magazine like that, something that some young man 20 years from now can look at as an inspiration? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Buckles:</b> I feel that way. I feel like I can go out there and get on the cover of the magazines and encourage the next persons, to be a recent example for them. A lot of people might be a little removed from Wendell Scott. I never got to meet him and I never had the chance to see him race. But if people can look at me, they can see me race and if I make it, that may be enough to carry the next person who&rsquo;s 8 years old and has a dream of getting into (Nextel) Cup. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Joe, you&rsquo;re 19 and the youngest member of this class. The way the sport is today, younger drivers seem to have more opportunities presented to them. Do you feel like your age gives you the most time to get to where you&rsquo;re trying to go? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Henderson:</b> I think so. But it all depends on how I develop my skills and get ready for these races and to move up. That&rsquo;s how it will be judged, by when I am ready to move up into the next division. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Q. </b><i>Could each of you talk about what you think the single most important thing is for you to get out of the Drive for Diversity program this year. At the end of this year, what&rsquo;s the one thing you would be most disappointed by if you don&rsquo;t accomplish it? </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Duncan: </b>I want to win races. I am competitive by nature and I want to win. The blessing of this program is having the support of sponsors to give me the equipment to go out and win and show that I am a competitive driver, I can win and I deserve a shot at the Busch or Truck series. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Driver: </b>My goal is to be successful and move on to the next series, and to help my sponsors broaden their horizons. We need to take them along with us so we can get into the framing part of it after we&rsquo;ve laid the foundation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Henderson: </b>I want to build a good relationship with Kodak and keep them with me and move up into another division. And I want to get my name out in NASCAR and let other teams hear it and feel that Joe Henderson is a good driver. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Buckles: </b>At the end of this season I&rsquo;d be disappointed only if somebody from this program doesn&rsquo;t move to the next level. I want to get out there and run good for my sponsors, for my team and for this program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Primus: </b>I would like to keep building my relationships with my sponsors and to win. But for me, it goes back to what got me into racing. I would sure like to put on some good racing this year for the fans. I want to come off that corner and have them up on their feet because we&rsquo;re battling side-by-side. I like putting on a show.
