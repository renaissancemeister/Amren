			<h1>
				Ex-Aide Charged With Fraud
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Joel Thurtell and David Ashenfelter, Detroit Free Press, May 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A former aide to U.S. Rep. John Conyers has been indicted in an alleged scheme to defraud sponsors and vendors of more than $170,000 for a conference for black farmers while he worked for the Democratic congressman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				DeWayne Boyd, 47, of Detroit was charged with multiple counts of mail fraud, theft of government property, bankruptcy fraud and making false statements in a federal lawsuit deposition and to the FBI and the U.S. Department of Agriculture about what he did with the money. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The indictment, returned April 27 and unsealed Tuesday, said Boyd was president of the National Organization of Black Farmers, which held a conference in New Orleans from May 21 to 23, 1999, to promote black farmers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It said Boyd raised $80,000 for the conference, including $65,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and wrote bad checks to induce vendors to provide $121,000 worth of goods and services. Boyd allegedly paid vendors $25,000 of the $80,000 he raised for the conference, but the rest of the money is missing, according to the indictment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although Boyd was a legislative assistant for Conyers when the alleged fraud occurred, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Collins said Conyers and his staff weren&rsquo;t involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Conyers&rsquo; office said it was pleased the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office had determined it wasn&rsquo;t involved in the scheme. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The comment from the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office speaks for itself,&rdquo; said Keenan Keller, a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee. Conyers is the ranking Democrat on the committee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boyd was fired by Conyers on Dec. 17, 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boyd surrendered to the U.S. Marshals Service on Tuesday and appeared in U.S. District Court in Detroit. Federal Magistrate Steven Whaleb released Boyd on $15,000 unsecured bond. He is to return to federal court today to complete his arraignment. His lawyer, Deputy Federal Defender Stacey Studnicki, declined to comment on the charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The indictment said Boyd was president of the group from March to April 1999 and was the primary organizer of the event. In May 1999, he allegedly arranged to have various vendors to provide catering, decorating, music, photography and other services for the conference. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On May 14, 1999, he allegedly wrote a $76,000 check to Aramark Sports &amp; Entertainment Services Inc. of Philadelphia for catering services, knowing there was less than $5,000 in the group&rsquo;s account to cover the check. He also wrote a $9,000 check to Freeman Decorating, based in Dallas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On May 24, 1999, he allegedly gave Aramark a second check for $26,000 and Freeman Decorating a second check for $10,000, knowing there was little money in the account. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The indictment said he solicited $40,000 of contributions for the event from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and $25,000 from Bank of America to be used solely for the conference. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In October 1999, Boyd allegedly submitted an invoice to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for $15,000 for conference expenses, but didn&rsquo;t use any of the money he received for the expenses, the indictment said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In June 2001, Boyd filed for bankruptcy. The indictment said he failed to disclose in an income statement that he had received $50,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Theft of government property carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The other charges carry maximum penalties of 5 years in prison and $250,000 fines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A federal judge ruled that the National Organization of Black Farmers did not exist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boyd came to Conyers&rsquo; attention in 1997 by claiming to be a leader of black farmers at a time when the congressman wanted to promote American farmers&rsquo; products in Detroit and Africa, according to a staffer who asked not to be identified. Conyers hired Boyd in April 1998 and assigned him to help organize the first National Conference of Black Farmers at the state fairgrounds in Detroit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boyd did not respond to Free Press requests for an interview.
