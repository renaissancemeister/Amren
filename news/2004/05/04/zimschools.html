			<h1>
				<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3682945.stm">Zimbabwe Closes &lsquo;Racist&rsquo; Schools</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, May 4</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The authorities in Zimbabwe have closed down at least 45 private schools due to a dispute over school fees. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Education Minister Aeneas Chigwedere said the schools had been closed because they increased their fees without government approval. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They throw Africans out simply by hiking fees,&rdquo; Mr Chigwedere said on state television. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are dealing with racist schools. They are all former white schools, all racist.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Notices have been placed on school gates informing parents and pupils of the closures and police officers are blocking the entrance to some schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state-run Herald newspaper reported that 30,000 pupils would be affected and listed the closed schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s sons and children of many ministers and ruling party leaders are believed to be among those turned away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Inflation rate</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The education minister said the schools would not reopen until they had complied with government regulations allowing them to increase their fees by only 10% a year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some schools have proposed raising fees by about 50% to counter the impact of the rampant inflation, currently running at 580%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s most prestigious schools are charging tuition fees of up to 30 million Zimbabwe dollars ($5,635) per year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before independence in 1980, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s best schools were reserved for whites. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But according to the South African news agency, Sapa, the majority of pupils at Zimbabwe&rsquo;s private schools are now black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although they are mainly from wealthier backgrounds, there are bursaries to allow poorer children to attend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Things are bad enough here without being stopped from getting the best education for your child if you can afford it,&rdquo; one father told The Associated Press news agency as his daughter was turned away from school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Educational decline</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In his independence day address on 18 April, President Mugabe also criticised the increase in fees for private schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our principal goal of attaining education for all appears to be in real jeopardy with some schools charging as much as 10 million (Zimbabwe) dollars a term,&rdquo; the president said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The government will soon come up with arrangements which will continue to make education accessible to each and every child regardless of his status or family background.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But some observers say the government has allowed the country&rsquo;s education system to decline, after it was greatly expanded after independence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				State-run schools in the country are reportedly in a critical condition &mdash; with many having classes of around 80 pupils. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is also said to be a shortage of teachers, textbooks, desks and classrooms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A recent survey by an International Monetary Fund research group, reported that school enrolment had declined by 60% in Zimbabwe last year because of fee hikes in both state and private schools.
