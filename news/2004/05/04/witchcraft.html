			<h1>
				Mozambique Arrests 14 For Witchcraft
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Agence France Presse, iafrica.com, Apr. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police in Mozambique&rsquo;s northern Nampula province have detained 14 people after body parts and organs were found in a house, apparently for use in witchcraft, the state Noticias newspaper reported on Friday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These people claim the organs were extracted from their dead relatives, not through murder but through magical techniques,&rdquo; Acting Provincial Attorney Daniel Magula was quoted by Noticias as saying, adding that an investigation was under way. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 14 were arrested last week after human hearts, arms, hands and legs were found in a house in the district of Nacaroa, northeast of Nampula city, the provincial capital. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Purification ritual</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The discovery was made during a purification ritual ordered by a local traditional chief and in which some of the 14 suspects took part, district administrator Cassamo Mussagy said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				President Joaquim Chissano on Thursday condemned the recent wave of killings and mutilations in Nampula province during his state of the nation address, saying they were &ldquo;an aberration to human morals, which must be denounced and severely punished.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said killings that took place in February and March in Nampula must be thoroughly investigated &ldquo;in order not to create a generalised feeling of insecurity and panic.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We should not allow Mozambique to become a fertile ground for this evil,&rdquo; Chissano told parliament. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Foreigners blamed for mutilations </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mozambique Human Rights League (LDH) recently blamed the mutilations on foreign witchdoctors, mostly from west Africa, who have settled in the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Mozambican woman and her two-year-old son were found murdered in Nampula province in late March, with the woman&rsquo;s genitals removed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Local Roman Catholic leaders contend that the killings are linked to trafficking of body parts and have demanded a thorough investigation.
