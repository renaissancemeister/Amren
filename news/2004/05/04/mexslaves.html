				Slavery Charges Send Man To Prison
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Juan Ramos, a citrus contractor from Lake Placid, will serve 15 years and pay $20,000 in fines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Robin Campbell, TCPalm (FL), May 4</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				FORT PIERCE &mdash; A Lake Placid citrus contractor, convicted of federal slavery and immigrant-harboring charges in 2002, was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Juan Ramos, 35, was also fined $20,000 for holding more than a hundred migrant workers from Mexico against their will. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was one of three men earlier convicted of conspiracy to violate federal laws by keeping migrant workers in involuntary servitude, interference with commerce through extortion by threats of violence, using a firearm in connection to a violent crime and harboring illegal aliens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Monday&rsquo;s sentencing included only the conspiracy and harboring charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Juan and his brother, Ramiro Ramos, who were sentenced once already in November 2002 on all four counts, succeeded on appeal to having the other two counts overturned a year later. Jose Ramos, their cousin, was exonerated of all four charges and set free in September. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Juan Ramos&rsquo; first sentence, in 2002 for 12 years in prison, was overturned. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Choking on tears, Ramos pleaded with the judge for a &ldquo;second chance.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;For 24 years I&rsquo;ve been living in the same town in the United States,&rdquo; Ramos said in Spanish, an interpreter relaying his pleas. &ldquo;Every person makes mistakes and every person deserves a second chance.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The FBI and U.S. Border Patrol in West Palm Beach arrested the three men in May 2001 after a two-year investigation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They found that the men collectively recruited more than 600 illegal Mexican immigrants and put them to work. They prevented them from leaving work, housed them in &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo; conditions and kept them working with threats of violence, court documents stated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Norman Rodriguez, Juan Ramos&rsquo; attorney, asked U.S. District Court Judge Michael Moore for leniency because he said it wasn&rsquo;t right to make an example of Ramos. The citrus industry is rampant with illegal migrant workers, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This business of harboring illegal immigrants is widespread,&rdquo; Rodriguez said. &ldquo;&hellip; So to say Juan Ramos deserves 15 years without regard of the abuses in the United States is disheartening. This responsibility needs to be shared.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Moore said sentencing acts as a deterrent for others who would hold illegal immigrants and force them to work.
