			<h1>
				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3681139.stm">Namibia Warns &lsquo;Racist&rsquo; Farmers</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, May 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Namibia&rsquo;s President Sam Nujoma has threatened to seize land from white farmers who treat their workers badly, a Namibian newspaper has reported.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Nujoma said a few &ldquo;racist&rdquo; farmers were laying off their workers and leaving them homeless, according to a report in The Namibian. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He warned that his government would not tolerate this kind of behaviour. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month Zimbabwe sent experts to Namibia to advise on redistributing land owned by white farmers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Aping Zimbabwe </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time, The Namibian newspaper said their arrival in the capital Windhoek could accelerate a planned expropriation of farmland, as Mr Nujoma had taken on many of the policies of his Zimbabwean counterpart, Robert Mugabe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Seizures of white-owned farms in Zimbabwe, often using intimidation and violence, have been under way for four years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Four thousand white farmers own about half of Namibia&rsquo;s arable land, a situation Mr Nujoma looks keen to reverse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a speech at May Day celebrations in Karibib Mr Nujoma declared that the expropriation of farms would not only be aimed at underutilised land, but as a punishment for racism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Some of the whites are behaving as if they came from Holland or Germany with land. . . steps will be taken and we can drive them out of this land. We have the capacity to do so,&rdquo; he was quoted in the newspaper as saying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Nujoma said a handful of &ldquo;minority racist farmers&rdquo; had not only evicted workers who had lived on the land for decades but had also told them to turn to the government for accommodation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My government will expropriate this land as an answer to the insult to my government,&rdquo; he said.
