			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Investigators say a Costa Mesa firm sold luxury cars without paying off loans used to obtain them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Lisa Munoz, Orange County Register, Apr. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police arrested 17 people before dawn today in Orange and southern Los Angeles counties in a massive bust of what officials are calling the largest auto-theft fraud ring in Orange County history. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Duty Free Auto Club in Costa Mesa defrauded buyers, banks and finance companies out of more than $8.5 million, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Investigators said six principals who ran Duty Free recruited co-conspirators, or &ldquo;straw-buyers,&rdquo; through advertisements in Southern California Vietnamese-language newspapers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those buyers used false credit profiles to buy high-end autos such as Hummers, BMWs and Cadillac Escalades at new-car dealerships. The co-conspirators then handed over the keys to Duty Free, which ceased making payments after two or three installments, then sold the car to an unsuspecting buyer, police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More than 200 DMV and local law-enforcement officers conducted the surprise undercover sweep. They raided 29 locations to serve the warrants on suspects at their homes or businesses. The arrests are the result of a two-year investigation by the Anaheim DMV Investigations office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on that agency&rsquo;s findings, the Orange County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office filed a 167-count felony complaint against Duty Free. The complaint accuses the used-car dealership of grand theft auto, conspiracy, burglary, forgery of DMV registration documents and making false financial statements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arrest warrants were issued for the six key suspects, who allegedly organized a scheme to purchase and sell 207 luxury vehicles, and for 15 co-conspirators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The company&rsquo;s Costa Mesa showroom was shut down months ago. When officers served the warrant there today, they found nothing, said Pete Pierce, an Orange County deputy district attorney. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Duty Free has previously denied any wrongdoing. The company could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the operators charged Thursday was Quang Thanh Nguyen, a principal in the dealership. In December, Nguyen was convicted in an unrelated case of 11 felony counts for defrauding banks and auto finance companies out of more than $140,000. He has not been sentenced, and he remains in custody.
