				Culberson: Enforce Immigration Law or Lose Pay
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Joseph A. D&rsquo;Agostino, Human Events Online, May 7</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rep. John Culberson (R.-Tex.), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, will propose legislation to stop the pay of federal bureaucrats who refuse to enforce immigration laws. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I, as an appropriator, will do everything in my power to change federal law so that any federal official who doesn&rsquo;t enforce immigration law doesn&rsquo;t get paid,&rdquo; Culberson told HUMAN EVENTS. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just for starters.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This has moved to the top of my agenda because of an idiotic town hall meeting conducted by federal law enforcement officials for law-breakers to tell them the law will not be enforced,&rdquo; said Culberson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to personally go over the Houston immigration office with a fine-toothed comb.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				On April 26, Joseph Webber, special agent in charge of the Houston office of the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), addressed a crowd of several hundred people at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Mexican-Americans. Webber attended the meeting to dispel rumors that ICE was conducting raids on worksites, schools, and churches to round up illegal aliens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Culberson said he would soon meet with officials from ICE, the FBI and the local U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;We have a growing flood of aliens coming over our borders,&rdquo; Culberson said. &ldquo;This is a national security concern. We must focus the nation&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; Culberson also cited the costs of illegal immigration. &ldquo;In Houston, in Harris County,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it costs $100 million a year.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				His position on the Appropriations Committee, Culberson said, gives him leverage. &ldquo;I know that the only way to get a bureaucrat&rsquo;s attention is through their money,&rdquo; he said. ICE needs to send a different message than the one Webber sent, said Culberson. It should be: &ldquo;If you come here illegally, you&rsquo;re going to be deported.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Carl Rusnok, director of communications for ICE&rsquo;s central region, addressed the congressman&rsquo;s contention that the agency was signaling illegal aliens that it did not intend to enforce the law. &ldquo;The only two things that we&rsquo;ve said are that the rumors of mass raids are untrue and that we will continue to enforce immigration law,&rdquo; said Rusnok. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been saying that for weeks.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asked if Webber may have gone further in his comments of April 26, Rusnok said he couldn&rsquo;t vouch for the specifics of what Webber said at that particular meeting. Asked if Webber promised not to conduct raids in the future, Rusnok replied, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there, but I think that would be extremely unlikely.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rusnok said the government policy of not raiding illegal alien worksites is not new. &ldquo;We have not changed our enforcement policy,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), said Webber was just articulating a policy first put in place in 1999. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t change anything. If you can fault him for anything, it might be tone,&rdquo; he said. The government backed off worksite enforcement of immigration laws after an uproar from local politicians and congressmen following a successful effort against illegal labor in Nebraska and Iowa meatpacking plants in 1998-99, said Krikorian. 
			</p>
			<p>
				ICE&rsquo;s 2002 statistical yearbook, the latest available, indicates worksite enforcement dropped 80% between 1998 and 2001. Only &ldquo;about 400&rdquo; illegal aliens were formally removed from the country due to worksite enforcement in 2002, says the yearbook. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Said Culberson: &ldquo;This issue is a sleeping giant that politicians had better wake up to because voters have had it.&rdquo;
