				Immigration Found To Cut U.S. Workers&rsquo; Pay
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Julia Malone, Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service, May 4</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; Two decades&rsquo; growth in the supply of immigrant workers cost native-born American men an average $1,700 in annual wages by the year 2000, a top economist has concluded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hispanic and black Americans were hurt most by the influx of foreign-born workers, says a new report by Harvard University&rsquo;s George J. Borjas, considered a leading authority on the impact of immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The findings, to be released today, could influence immigration proposals now being urged by lawmakers and the White House. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Congressional Democrats plan today to launch comprehensive legislation whose provisions would legalize immigrant workers already here, guarantee labor rights and allow an increased flow of legal, temporary foreign workers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this year, President Bush announced his own overhaul for immigration that would offer temporary legal status to workers now here and open the door for greater numbers of &ldquo;willing workers&rdquo; from abroad to take temporary jobs in America. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In his report, Borjas suggests that one effect of such proposals would be to depress Americans&rsquo; wage growth for all levels of education and job skills. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His study of two decades of wages concluded that U.S.-born high school dropouts suffered the most &mdash; a 7.4 percent drop in annual wages by the year 2000. For high school graduates and workers with some college, the loss was a little more than 2 percent. And for college graduates, wages were held back an average 3.6 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Borjas found that U.S.-born Hispanic workers saw their wages reduced by an average 5 percent, and U.S.-born blacks experienced a 4.5 percent drop. These two groups faced the most direct competition from foreign-born workers, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>&ldquo;The reduction in earnings occurs regardless of whether the immigrants are legal or illegal, permanent or temporary,&rdquo; said Borjas, himself an immigrant from Cuba. &ldquo;It is the presence of additional workers that reduces wages, not their legal status.&rdquo;</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report, an updated version of an article in the <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> last year, is being published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research group that favors lower levels of immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Borjas study on the impact is unusually bleak, said Jared Bernstein, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a research group financed by labor unions. &ldquo;I think the magnitude of the effect is quite large relative to other research,&rdquo; he said, arguing that the impact on wages is probably somewhat less dramatic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Economist Robert Lerman, a senior fellow at the generally pro-immigration Urban Institute, said that Borjas had made a &ldquo;fine study&rdquo; of the wage effects through 2000, but added that his conclusions <em>might </em>not hold for the next two decades.
