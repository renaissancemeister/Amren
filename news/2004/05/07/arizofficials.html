				2 Officials Seek Limits On Legal Immigration
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Howard Fischer, Arizona Daily Star, Capitol Media Services, May 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PHOENIX &mdash; Two of the organizers of an initiative to halt government services for illegal entrants said Wednesday that they also want curbs on legal immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rep. Randy Graf, R-Green Valley, said even the influx of those who enter this country legally depresses the wages of men already living here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And Rep. Russell Pearce, R-Mesa, said he favors a moratorium on legal immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The comments came as members of the Protect Arizona Now campaign announced they have more than 60,000 signatures to put their measure on the November ballot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They need 122,612 valid names on petitions by July 1. But given the percentage of signatures that normally are voided, organizers acknowledged they really need 140,000-plus. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The measure would make most nonemergency government services off limits to those not in the country legally. It would also require presentation of certain documents before anyone can cast a ballot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Graf cited a study released this week which concluded that the increase in immigration from 1980 through 2000 reduced the average American income by 4 percent, or $1,700. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That study by Harvard economist George Borjas said the impact is greater on those without a high-school education, especially minorities. And Borjas said the results show no difference whether the immigrants are here legally or not. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pearce said the influx of people from other countries &ldquo;is on its way to destroying America if we don&rsquo;t get our arms around immigration in this country, both legal and illegal.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He noted that many of the terrorists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks were here legally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The validity of Borjas&rsquo; findings is under debate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert Lerman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, called the report &ldquo;a quality piece of work.&rdquo; But he suggested there are other factors that might make Borjas&rsquo; conclusions invalid, such as the way he calculates wage rates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lerman also said the biggest impact of immigration is really on those who are high-school dropouts, the people most likely to be in direct competition with the new residents. He called it &ldquo;dubious&rdquo; whether immigration affects the wages of those who are college or even high-school graduates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said the figures Borjas came up with are higher than those in other studies.
