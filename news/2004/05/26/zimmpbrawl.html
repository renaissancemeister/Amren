				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3727855.stm">Zimbabwe MPs Brawl In Parliament</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, May 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>An opposition MP attacked a minister in Zimbabwe&rsquo;s parliament in retaliation for &ldquo;personal and racist abuse&rdquo;. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Roy Bennett, one of three white MPs, assaulted Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, after the minister said Mr Bennett would never return to his farm. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state-run Ziana news agency said Mr Bennett &ldquo;grabbed Chinamasa by the throat, shook him violently and pushed him to the ground&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Bennett has been chased off his land despite court orders in his favour. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Saw red&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Chinamasa said he was being &ldquo;punished&rdquo; for the crimes of his ancestors, according to Mr Bennett&rsquo;s colleagues from the Movement for Democratic Change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I am a person, I have feelings and [after] the vehement, personal, racial attack that Chinamasa was making against me, I saw red and reacted,&rdquo; Mr Bennett told the BBC&rsquo;s Network Africa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of Mr Bennett&rsquo;s employees have been killed and many severely assaulted as militants have taken over his farm in the south-eastern district of Chimanimani, in support of the government&rsquo;s land reform programme. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said he had been insulted on numerous previous occasions and had &ldquo;bit his tongue&rdquo; in the past. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He alleged that a ruling party MP had pulled out a gun during the fracas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Feeble kick&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Anti-corruption Minister Didymus Mutasa, 69, said that Mr Bennett had also attacked him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;On the camera, it appears as though I was beaten but in fact I fell down trying to avoid the blow. I gave him a severe kick on his chest,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Mutasa said that Mr Chinamasa had remained calm throughout the brawl and had continued his statement staright afterwards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But the MDC man was mad, raving mad,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Bennett saw things differently. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He kicked me up the backside. It was a feeble kick. He&rsquo;s too old. If I hit him, he&rsquo;ll die,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Bennett did not apologise for the incident but said: &ldquo;One&rsquo;s not proud of it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But MDC leader of the house and party vice president Gibson Sibanda apologised to Mr Chinamasa and the parliament speaker, saying his party did not condone such &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; behaviour, according to Ziana. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zanu-PF chief whip Joram Gumbo said parliament would set up a committee to look into the incident. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, the MDC lost a by-election in Lupane &mdash; one of their strongholds &mdash; amid allegations of that Zanu-PF used violence and food aid to bribe voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Zanu-PF is now just three seats short of having the two-thirds majority which would enable it to amend the constitution.
