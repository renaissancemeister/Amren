			<h1>
				ICLU Questions Legality Of Flag Restrictions
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Seth Slabaugh, StarPress.com (IN), May 26 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				MUNCIE &mdash; Banning Confederate, NASCAR, Colts, Pacers and other flags while allowing American and POW-MIA flags at Prairie Creek Reservoir&rsquo;s campground could cause legal problems for the city of Muncie, according to the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The law is that in a public forum such as a park speech is protected, even speech many of us would find offensive,&rdquo; said Fran Quigley, executive director of the ICLU. &ldquo;The whole principle is, we let all kinds of messages be transmitted, and we don&rsquo;t censor them and we certainly don&rsquo;t favor one over another. Flags are certainly a form of speech that&rsquo;s protected by the First Amendment.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city recently banned all flags except the American flag and the POW-MIA flag from the campground after receiving a complaint last year from a black family about the displaying of Confederate battle flags at the campground. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the fact the United States is at war with Ira &mdash; Qand the fact that Americans have been taken prisoner during that war &mdash; Mayor Dan Canan says it is appropriate to allow campers to display American and POW-MIA flags. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If somebody wants to make an issue out of that, let them go ahead,&rdquo; Canan said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Indiana University law professor Daniel Conkle said the case was not an open-and-shut one. A challenger could sue the city and potentially win, but Conkle&rsquo;s hunch is that the city would prevail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The way First Amendment law operates,&rdquo; Conkle said, &ldquo;much depends on the nature of the city&rsquo;s policy. The key issue is whether the city is acting in a way that discriminates against a particular viewpoint. If the policy is broad enough to avoid that particular criticism, the city is probably on fairly stable ground. If a challenger can prove the city is targeting a particular viewpoint it doesn&rsquo;t like, that challenger is likely to prevail.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The more exceptions the city allows to its ban on campground flags, &ldquo;the First Amendment would begin to get stronger,&rdquo; Conkle said. &ldquo;Once you get to the POW-MIA flag, maybe it gets a little trickier in terms of how the city would describe its policy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city&rsquo;s new policy on campground flags is not in writing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s not a critical problem, Conkle said, but if there is a challenge, it&rsquo;d be better for the city to have a written policy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Maybe we need to add that to the park rules,&rdquo; said John Parker, park board president. 
			</p>
			<p>
				People who display Confederate flags at the reservoir probably think they are &ldquo;rebelling against the establishment,&rdquo; said John Rouse, a political science professor at Ball State University. &ldquo;But history clearly shows that the Confederate flag is the symbol of institutionalized racism.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rodney Johnson, a 1972 graduate of Southside High School now living in Atlanta, recalls the Confederate battle flag causing racial division before being dropped as the school&rsquo;s flag during his sophomore year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several years ago, Johnson joined thousands of others in a march in South Carolina to protest the flying of the Confederate battle flag on top of the Statehouse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I see that flag, I think, one, of the Klan,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;Two, to me it represents what that flag stood for. They fought for slavery instead of against slavery.&rdquo;
