				<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/26/nvote26.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/05/26/ixportaltop.html">Voters &lsquo;Are Losing Faith In Immigration Policy&rsquo;</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Philip Johnston, telegraph.co.uk, May 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Voters have virtually lost confidence in government policy on immigration, according to a survey for The Telegraph. 
			</p>
			<p>
				People do not trust ministers either to give them the true picture or take their wishes into account. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The findings come as new figures show that more than 120,000 foreign nationals were granted British citizenship in 2003, a record total and more than three times the number in 1997. There were also 140,000 new applications for citizenship last year, a 21 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Separate Home Office data indicated that asylum applications continued to fall significantly in the first three months of the year. However, the decline has had no impact on immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The YouGov poll suggests that immigration is now seen as the most important issue facing the country, ahead of crime, the NHS and terrorism. Few people are convinced by arguments that large numbers of foreign workers are needed to fill job vacancies. A substantial majority considers that the country is already too crowded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this month, Tony Blair acknowledged that public worries about immigration were real and should not be dismissed as &ldquo;figments of racist imagination&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the country had reached &ldquo;a crunch point&rdquo; on the issue but maintained that high levels of &ldquo;managed migration&rdquo; were needed to underpin economic growth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, said there was &ldquo;no obvious limit&rdquo; to the number of economic migrants that Britain could accept. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But almost 60 per cent of YouGov&rsquo;s respondents disagreed with this statement and only a quarter agreed. Three quarters of those questioned said there were too many immigrants and just three per cent thought that there were too few. Most people said that if there were job vacancies, Britons should be trained to fill them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the debate over asylum and immigration has become merged in recent years, an analysis by the National Audit Office, also published yesterday, concluded: &ldquo;There is no clear statistical evidence that the reduction in the number of asylum applications has had any significant impact on other forms of migration.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Government believes that large numbers of migrant workers are to be encouraged. Des Browne, the Home Office minister, said: &ldquo;We need legal migrants who want to work, pay taxes and contribute to our economy. I hope this report will now enable the debate to move on and allow a sensible discussion of the issues.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the issue was one of scale. &ldquo;Massive societal changes have been taking place without any real explanation or debate,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The British public are clearly unhappy yet no attempt has been made to have a dialogue with them and explain exactly what the strategy is.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While asylum applications fell to 10,500 in the first quarter of 2004, continuing a downward trend apparent for almost a year, legal immigration continues at historically high levels. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2002, the number of people arriving to settle and work rose above half a million for the first time, to 512,800. Over the past five years, net immigration &mdash; the difference between those leaving and arriving &mdash; was 790,000. There are no figures for the numbers in the country illegally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The NAO was also asked to consider allegations that the Home Office was &ldquo;massaging&rdquo; its asylum statistics. It considered them to be &ldquo;broadly reliable.&rdquo;
