			<h1>
				Black Authenticity
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Justice Thomas doesn&rsquo;t pass the litmus test. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Mark Goldblatt, National Review Online, May 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Every now and then C-SPAN broadcasts a panel discussion hosted by radio talk-show personality <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/tavis/">Tavis Smiley</a>, during which a half-dozen or so liberal black leaders hold forth on the progress of and prospects for African Americans. These tend to be depressingly paranoid clich&eacute;-fests, scattered with gratuitous swipes at the Bush White House, John Ashcroft, the Florida presidential vote, &ldquo;white supremacy,&rdquo; &ldquo;the prison-industrial complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the invisible hand of structural oppression&rdquo; &mdash; all of which came up during Saturday&rsquo;s colloquium on the 50th anniversary of the landmark <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> decision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The guests included activist Jesse Jackson, law professor Lani Guinier, social psychologist James Jones, and several lesser lights, including a token Latino and Asian. The conversation followed predictable lines, with Guinier trotting out her socialist cant and Jackson speaking in trite parables; the Asian panelist rejected the &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; tag, insisting Asian kids score highly on standardized tests chiefly because their parents are themselves highly educated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, the issue of culture and education elicited a rare self-critical comment by Smiley, who decried the phenomenon of black kids teasing other black kids who were &ldquo;getting their learn on&rdquo; because, to their tormenters, doing well in school was &ldquo;acting white.&rdquo; Jones echoed this sentiment, critiquing the mindset that holds that &ldquo;failing at school is somehow a validation of your black heritage.&rdquo; Such a narrow concept of racial authenticity, the panelists concurred, was indeed deplorable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet an hour later, when Guinier noted in passing, &ldquo;We have a black person on the Supreme Court,&rdquo; Smiley responded, with mock incredulity, &ldquo;We do?&rdquo; By which he meant, of course, that Clarence Thomas &mdash; because he doesn&rsquo;t share the panelists&rsquo; left-liberal politics &mdash; is not authentically black. He is, as Jackson explained, &ldquo;an unrepresentative aberration.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				So there you have it: Black kids who take a different view of schoolwork get teased by other black kids for not being authentically black &mdash; and black adults who take a different view of politics get teased by black leaders for not being authentically black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Which begs the question: Will black leaders ever grow up? 
			</p>
