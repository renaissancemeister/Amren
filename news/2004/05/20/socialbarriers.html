				<i>James A. Fussell, Kansas City Star, Miami Herald, May 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>KANSAS CITY, Mo. &mdash; </b>In 1984, Mike and Stephanie Howell did something that used to be illegal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The interracial couple got married. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike is black. Stephanie is white. In the 1950s, many states outlawed such marriages. Even in the 1980s, interracial unions still raised eyebrows, and tempers. People stared, threw eggs at Mike&rsquo;s car and sent him threatening letters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, the Lenexa, Kan., couple said, interracial marriages simply are not that incendiary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Progress? 
			</p>
			<p>
				You bet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Acceptance of black-white relationships has come a long way in the 50 years since Brown v. Board of Education helped put an end to legal segregation. The question is, have we? 
			</p>
			<p>
				The answer is inarguably yes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And no. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently the Howells&rsquo; teenage son went to pick up a date who is white. The girl&rsquo;s father took one look at his dark skin and slammed the door in his face. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Progress? 
			</p>
			<p>
				None. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;To treat a kid with that kind of overt racism is just wrong,&rdquo; Mike Howell said. &ldquo;I was more than ready to jump in the car and say, &lsquo;Slam it in my face.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Racism cannot be legislated away, said sociologist Jean Van Delinder, who did her doctoral work on the Brown decision at the University of Kansas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Once the legal barriers to segregation were removed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;blacks and whites had to reinvent how they interacted with each other.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some did it better than others. Significant progress, she said, will come only generation by generation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Once all the memories diminish, that will help erase the stigma of blacks being separate,&rdquo; and things will change a lot, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So how far have we come since Brown? The answer is always the same: Far, but not far enough. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I still think we have a long way to go,&rdquo; Stephanie Howell said. &ldquo;Some people simply have a relationship with an interracial couple because it&rsquo;s the politically correct thing to do. It doesn&rsquo;t come from their heart.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Certainly the country is different than it was in May 1954. Some changes came quickly. In June 1954, less than a month after the Supreme Court decision, Kansas City area swimming pools opened to blacks. Other changes took longer, but came nonetheless. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Black-white marriages are up sevenfold since 1960. And a survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 60 percent of whites and 77 percent of nonwhites approve of interracial marriages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Blacks and whites now go to school together, become best friends and work at the same jobs. At the same time, racial prejudice still exists. And segregation in many neighborhoods, churches and social organizations is widespread. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It certainly would have been impossible in 1954 for an African-American to be the secretary of state and the national security adviser&rdquo; as they are today, said Norm Yetman, chairman of the American Studies program at the University of Kansas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, Yetman said, inequality is not gone. In 1964, out of half a million elected officials in the country, only 103 were black. By 2000, the number rose, but only to 9,000. That was just 2 percent, while blacks made up 13 percent of the population. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps the best hope lies in our youth. At Raytown South High School in Raytown, Mo., sophomores Victor Carter and Tyson Sprick are a testament to Brown&rsquo;s transformative effects. Victor is black, Tyson white. They are best friends. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before Brown, such students probably would not have met. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, they say, they are the exception at their school, which is still segregated in many places &mdash; in the lunchroom, at dances, at football games. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With more contact comes more understanding. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I met him (in first grade) there was no such thing as a color barrier,&rdquo; Victor said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how I grew up to know him. He was just Tyson, my best friend.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Others still find it odd. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People bring it up sometimes,&rdquo; Victor said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know your best friend&rsquo;s white? You&rsquo;re always hanging out with white people.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s time to get over skin color, Tyson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Race is not a factor.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				At Lincoln University, a historically black college in Jefferson City, Mo., race is becoming less of a factor, said history professor Tony Holland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I first came here in 1970, I used to see the black students all sit together and the white students all sit together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now they intermix. &hellip; It&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But an improving racial climate in schools does not mean all is well in society, Holland said. Often there is still a discomfort between whites and blacks, albeit unspoken or unrealized. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You take two steps forward and one step back,&rdquo; Holland said. &ldquo;My father didn&rsquo;t endure what his grandfather did. And I didn&rsquo;t go through what my father did. And now I have great hopes for my children and my grandchildren that it will be even better.&rdquo;
