			<h1>
				Chrysler Fires Back At Ex-Dealer
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Automaker says Chicago seller who accused company of racist lending engaged in fraud 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Brett Clanton, The Detroit News, May 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				DaimlerChrysler AG&rsquo;s Chrysler Group fired back at a former dealer on Monday who has accused the automaker of racist lending practices, saying he was &ldquo;engaged in a massive fraud scheme&rdquo; that included lying on customers&rsquo; credit applications and conning buyers into taking bad loan deals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chrysler also filed court documents Monday seeking a swift end to a discrimination lawsuit brought against the company by customers of former Chicago-area dealer Gerald Gorman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the end, Chrysler Financial shut down a dishonest, crooked dealership that was duping and defrauding both its customers and Chrysler Financial,&rdquo; the company said in a statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The moves came in response to a separate court filing Monday by six customers, all African-Americans, who asked a federal court in Chicago to grant class action status to their discriminatory lending case against Chrysler Financial, the automaker&rsquo;s finance arm, which originally was filed last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a class action, the case would be open to thousands of Chrysler customers nationwide who may have the same complaint, and expose the automaker to a rash of unwelcome media attention. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a statement Monday, Chrysler called the potential class action case &ldquo;a smoke screen to cover up financial and legal improprieties on the part of the dealer, Gerald Gorman.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Attorneys for the six African-American plaintiffs and Gerald Gorman could not be reached Monday for comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawsuits gained national attention, drawing civil rights activist Al Sharpton to Chicago in February to lead a demonstration against Chrysler at the Chicago auto show. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gorman, who used to own two Chrysler dealerships, sued Chrysler last year, alleging that the automaker routinely turned down loan applications from his minority customers. The case still is pending. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Chrysler said Gorman made an issue of its loan approval system only after the automaker questioned his business dealings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chrysler said Gorman had been overcharging customers and profiting from the gains, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to the automaker to instead bankroll his wife&rsquo;s political campaign, vacation homes and personal credit cards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chrysler uncovered 54 fraudulent contracts worth more than $1.3 million at Gorman dealerships, which spurred the automaker to revoke Gorman&rsquo;s dealer licenses in 2002, the company said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the automaker is owed back payments, it is not filing a countersuit against Gorman, said Chrysler spokesman Jason Vines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The automaker said court documents made public Monday will prove the customers&rsquo; accusations of discrimination are unfounded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the main documents cited by the company is the deposition of Jerrell Coburn, a Chicago resident who would be the lead plaintiff in a class action suit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chrysler claims Coburn&rsquo;s loan application was never submitted to Chrysler Financial &mdash; so Chrysler could not have rejected it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And when Coburn was shown a copy of his loan application during his deposition, he acknowledged that it did not include key financial information, including a past bankruptcy, that he had provided to the dealership.
