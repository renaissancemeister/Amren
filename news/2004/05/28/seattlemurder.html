				<a href="https://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/175023_stanwood26.html">Ex-Boyfriend Kills Stanwood Teen, Himself, Shocking Small Community</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Deborah Bach, Gregory Roberts, and Sam Skolnik, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				STANWOOD &mdash; The romance was over, but Mainor &ldquo;Mario&rdquo; Valentin wouldn&rsquo;t stay away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For two months, Valentin tracked his ex-girlfriend, Stanwood High School senior Dayna Fure, all over town &mdash; to her home, to her grandparents&rsquo; house, even to her sister&rsquo;s house in Marysville. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On May 13, he followed her to a nail salon and then to the Stanwood retirement home where she worked, showing her a gun he had bought and telling her he was going to kill himself. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The next day &mdash; her 18th birthday &mdash; Fure got a court order to keep Valentin at a distance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It didn&rsquo;t work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, Valentin &mdash; a 23-year-old would-be policeman &mdash; shot Fure in the head and then killed himself the same way, authorities said. Her father found the bodies in his daughter&rsquo;s bedroom when he returned home about 5 p.m. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The murder-suicide sent shock waves through this small Snohomish County community, where Fure&rsquo;s family has lived for many years, and left a high school in mourning. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I heard,&rdquo; said Stanwood High junior Rachael Lipinski, who was on the cross-country team with Fure. &ldquo;I thought it couldn&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s devastated,&rdquo; said John Gilday, a restaurant designer and head of Waterfund, a Kirkland charitable organization that builds drinking-water cisterns and schools for the poor in Mexico and provides health services there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gilday met Fure when she and a friend volunteered to help build a school in Mexico in 2002. Fure, he said, was &ldquo;bubbly&rdquo; and &ldquo;determined,&rdquo; &ldquo;fearless&rdquo; and &ldquo;honest.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She was everything that I would want my daughter to be, if I had a daughter,&rdquo; Gilday said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fure brought Valentin with her to an orientation session before she went to Mexico. Valentin glared in silence through the hourlong presentation, Gilday recalled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Later, Gilday said, Fure told him that Valentin didn&rsquo;t want her to go to Mexico &mdash; and didn&rsquo;t like her to do anything without him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Valentin&rsquo;s behavior turned more ominous after Fure attempted to break off their relationship two months ago, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and statements she made to obtain the protection order. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He followed her, called her often and wrote letters threatening suicide, Fure said. &ldquo;I have given many reasons and hints to leave me alone and after two months of separation, he is determined to do whatever to get me back,&rdquo; she wrote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On May 13, the sheriff&rsquo;s office said, he trailed her to the nail salon and displayed a small handgun, again threatening to kill himself. Fure left the salon for her job in the dining room at a Stanwood retirement home. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When Fure got off work later that day, she found Valentin inside her car, she said. She called 911. Police came, and after a 90-minute negotiation via cellular phone, took Valentin into custody and then to the Colby Campus of Providence Everett Medical Center for a mental-health evaluation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police discovered a gun in his car and confiscated it. The next day, Fure got the protection order. And sometime before Monday, Valentin got another gun. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was unclear yesterday how long Valentin was at the hospital before being released. A hospital spokeswoman did not return calls. 
			</p>
			<p>
				People with potential mental health problems deemed to be a threat to themselves or others can be committed involuntarily for up to 72 hours, or longer after a court hearing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Valentin, who moved to Seattle from Honduras with his family in 1992, worked as a downtown safety &ldquo;ambassador&rdquo; and was applying to become a Seattle police officer, according to one of his sisters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marta Valentin, 27, said her younger brother met Fure at a nightclub in Seattle and that the two had been dating off and on for two years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We loved her. Oh my God, she had such spirit. We&rsquo;re going to miss her,&rdquo; she said last night at the modest, two-story townhouse in West Seattle&rsquo;s High Point neighborhood where her brother lived with her, their mother and two other sisters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marta Valentin described her brother as a &ldquo;great kid&rdquo; who helped out other neighborhood youths, but said he&rsquo;d been depressed about Fure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She was beautiful,&rdquo; Marta said, crying. &ldquo;She wanted to do so much with her life. &hellip; We can&rsquo;t believe this happened.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yesterday, students and staff at Stanwood High School grieved the loss of the popular senior. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside the building, the U.S. flag flew at half-staff above a memorial where students placed flowers, candles and balloons. A simple wooden cross was propped up next to a potted sunflower, and a drawing of a smiling Fure was taped to the flagpole above photos of her as a toddler and at the recent school prom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Messages chalked on the sidewalk and written on a banner mourned the loss of a girl described as always optimistic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lipinski remembered being on a long run with her last fall when she pulled up lame. Fure asked Lipinski how she was doing and encouraged her to keep going. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She was like, &lsquo;We can make it. We&rsquo;ve only got a couple miles left,&rsquo; &ldquo; Lipinski remembered. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Teammate Stacy Holtmann said Fure could always be counted on to cheer on others. &ldquo;At races, people would always cry if they did bad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not Dayna &mdash; she&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;You tried. That&rsquo;s all that matters.&rsquo; &ldquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overcome with emotion, senior Sierra Webb said: &ldquo;She was an angel &mdash; that&rsquo;s all I can say.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fure attended Stanwood-Camano schools since kindergarten, and was known as a diligent student and a talented athlete. She was ranked 38th in this year&rsquo;s senior class of 366 students, and maintained a grade-point average of 3.8. Fure lettered for four years in cross-country running, and also had perfect attendance on the team during that time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During this school year&rsquo;s track season, she received a &ldquo;best attitude&rdquo; award. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Vice Principal Jim Piccolo, who has known Fure&rsquo;s family for nearly three decades, said she&rsquo;d been accepted to Gonzaga University and was looking forward to starting there in the fall. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That was a real dream of hers, to be there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When she was accepted, it was a breath of fresh air for her.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Family members declined to comment yesterday. Fure&rsquo;s friends said she was extremely close to her older sister, Danielle, who was on the cross-country team with her before graduating from Stanwood High two years ago. Fure reportedly also had two stepbrothers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lynda Wagner, general manager of the Merrill Gardens retirement center, said Fure was &ldquo;a doll&rdquo; who loved the residents and made each one feel special. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She was very, very giving of herself to the people she took care of.&rdquo;
