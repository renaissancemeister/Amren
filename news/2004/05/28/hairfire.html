				Student Whose Hair Set Afire Told To Stay Home

				Alleged Attacker Remains In School 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>DenverChannel.com, May 26</i>

				<i>(AR Note: Click on the title to see a video on this story. We are unable to confirm that the perpetrator was non-white; however, it is likely that he was. This school is more than 90 percent non-white, as you can see from its website.) </i>

				DENVER &mdash; A 13-year-old Denver girl said she was threatened with a knife at her middle school and her hair was set on fire, yet she was the one who was told to stay home for the remainder of the school year while her alleged attacker wasn&rsquo;t suspended or even investigated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Courtney Glowczewski has a small right arm and leg because of cerebral palsy, a disability that her teachers say has not kept her from working hard in school and being a good student. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I do really good in my classes. My teachers tell me, &lsquo;Good job,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re doing very good,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Excellent girl,&rsquo;&ldquo; said Glowczewski. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But her physical appearance has made her a target of taunting and of physical attack, which she said has never been addressed by the administration at Martin Luther King Middle School. Last week, she said the bullying got worse when she said she was threatened and assaulted by a seventh grade boy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He pulled out a knife, a silver knife, a pocket knife, and then he said &lsquo;What!?&rsquo; So I was scared and didn&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; said Glowczewski. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As she walked to her seat she smelled smoke and one of her classmates was patting her hard on the back. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I looked and there was a black spot on the back of my shirt. And then I saw some black hair falling from my hair,&rdquo; said Glowczewski. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her hair was on fire and the other student said that she was trying to help put it out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her mother, Sherrie, was called to school when her daughter reported the incident to the assistant principal. Sherrie Glowczewski was outraged when she was told by the administration at Martin Luther King that her daughter didn&rsquo;t need to come back and not to worry about the tests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I just wanted to go to a school that doesn&rsquo;t make fun of me. I wanted to be treated with respect,&rdquo; Glowczewski said, crying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, her mother has made repeated phone calls to the assistant principal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have no idea what they&rsquo;ve done. That&rsquo;s why I want to speak to her. I want to know what happened to (the bullying suspect) and what&rsquo;s going on in that school,&rdquo; said Sherrie Glowczewski. 
			</p>
			<p>
				7NEWS discovered that while Glowczewski was sent home, her alleged attacker is still in school, even though administrators confirmed he had a knife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The principal has now admitted her staff did not call police, did not interview potential witnesses, and did not conduct a proper investigation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t come back in school. I should be in school taking my education and it&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; said Glowczewski. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The interim principal at Martin Luther King Middle School declined an on-camera interview, but said her staff made serious mistakes in this case and that she will offer Glowczewski and her family a summer school program and transportation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, both Mark Stevens, the spokesman for Denver Public Schools, and the superintendent declined to discuss the case or DPS policy for dealing with such issues. That seems to be the same response Glowczewski&rsquo;s parents got when they complained to the administration.
