				Crime Task Force Starts With Crime Stats
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				40 people begin work on Savannah&rsquo;s Public Safety Study Task Force as it seeks to cope with staggering young black male crime figures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Scott M. Larson, SavannahNOW.com, May 28</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Roddrick Marshall sat quietly writing as Savannah Mayor Otis Johnson unveiled the staggeringly disproportionate number of black male homicide victims and perpetrators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I thought it would have been a little bit more than that,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since 2002, 71 percent of people murdered and 90 percent of those arrested in Savannah were black males. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe Marshall, a 29-year-old black man, could have been one of them. He was arrested five times on auto theft charges and spent three and a half years in prison. He was on a bad path.

				But Thursday night at the Savannah Civic Center, Marshall was as an example of what can go wrong &mdash; and what can go right. He&rsquo;s one of 40 people on Savannah&rsquo;s Public Safety Study Task Force, charged with critiquing the entire criminal justice system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that we can ask serious questions of some of these agencies,&rdquo; said Marshall, who now has a steady job and mentors to youth in the system. &ldquo;They are used to running things their way.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the first meeting of the task force, young black males took center stage. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a problem and this problem is primarily in the black community,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;This is a black problem because we are both the victims and the perpetrators and we have to do something about it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Why such a problem with young black males? That is one of the things this task force was charged with answering in the year it has to operate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Poverty and racism exist, Johnson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But it cannot be an excuse,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Black crime statistics weren&rsquo;t the only problem discussed. Police presented statistics showing that downtown areas lead in violent crimes while southside areas have more property crimes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johnson walked around the room with the task force sitting around him like he was back teaching at Savannah State University. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An audience member leaned over to another and said: &ldquo;No one has ever been this frank about crime.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The brainchild of Johnson during last year&rsquo;s mayoral election, Johnson sped up its formation after a spate of high-profile crimes. Savannah City Council members submitted nominations and the task force&rsquo;s makeup was supposed to reflect the community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There was little back-and-forth discussion during this first meeting as Johnson laid out the plans and formation of the group. A five-person steering committee will lead and members will join subcommittees addressing police, juvenile justice, courts and prosecution, prison and probation and re-entry into the community after prison. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, the group, which will meet every two weeks, will recommend goals and strategies for each area.
