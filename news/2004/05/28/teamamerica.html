				Help For &lsquo;Patriot&rsquo; Candidates
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Javier Erik Olvera, Rocky Mountain News, May 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo is trying to build a coalition in Congress to overhaul what he calls America&rsquo;s &ldquo;lax&rdquo; immigration policies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Republican from Colorado has started a political action committee to help congressional candidates who share his vision of tougher borders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tancredo enlisted Angela &ldquo;Bay&rdquo; Buchanan, a political heavyweight who served as U.S. treasurer from 1981 to 1983 under President Reagan, to help. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the duo&rsquo;s leadership, the group &mdash; known as Team America &mdash; has mushroomed since it was formed about three months ago. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So far, &ldquo;several thousand&rdquo; people have gotten involved and have donated $100,000 in the past six weeks, said Buchanan, sister of conservative TV commentator Pat Buchanan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been extremely well-received,&rdquo; said Buchanan, who was campaign chairwoman for her brother&rsquo;s presidential bids in 1992, 1996 and 2000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tancredo has stepped away from Team America&rsquo;s campaigning and membership drive because of laws that bar him from being actively involved, said Buchanan, Team America co-chair. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as founding co-chairman, Tancredo lends his message and name to the group whose motto is: &ldquo;The Defense of a Nation Begins at its Borders.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to www.teamamericapac.org, the Virginia-based group&rsquo;s mission is to &ldquo;identify, recruit and help elect to public office individual patriots who agree with our motto. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We will reach out to the millions of Americans who agree that American immigration policy is in dire need of emergency reform.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the next few months, the group hopes to raise its membership to 10,000. So far, it has reached more than 5,000 people through mailers, word-of-mouth and the Web site. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Buchanan did not have a membership figure, but said several thousand people have donated amounts from $10 to $5,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not everyone is happy with the group&rsquo;s presence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bill Vandenberg, co-director of the Colorado Progressive Coalition, a network of statewide civil rights and racial justice groups, says Tancredo should focus on issues important to his constituents.
