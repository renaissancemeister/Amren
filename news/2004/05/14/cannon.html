			<h1>
				RightMarch Recruits &lsquo;Conservative&rsquo; to Run Against &lsquo;Liberal&rsquo; GOP Congressman
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jimmy Moore, Talon News, May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SANDY, UT (Talon News)</b> &mdash; Conservative political action committee RightMarch.com successfully recruited former Republican Utah state senator Matt Throckmorton to run against incumbent U.S. Rep. Chris Cannon (R-UT) in the upcoming primary to serve as &ldquo;a wake-up call&rdquo; to all liberal Republican legislators who run as Republicans but subsequently abandon their conservative principles once they are elected into office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				RightMarch.com claims credit for persuading Utah&rsquo;s GOP state convention delegates to &ldquo;put Chris Cannon last&rdquo; by not electing him to another term. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In just three days of fundraising, RightMarch.com claims it has been able to generate $7,500 in online donations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Calling this a &ldquo;victory cry for true conservative Republicans and a wake-up call to RINOs [Republicans In Name Only],&rdquo; RightMarch.com revealed that it distributed 4,000 flyers to convention delegates detailing Cannon&rsquo;s position on granting &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; to illegal aliens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The flyer said a Congressman is needed who will &ldquo;protect our borders.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				William Greene, who serves as the president of RightMarch.com, said it is time to challenge this &ldquo;loose cannon,&rdquo; referring to Cannon, and have him &ldquo;removed from office.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even Chuck Muth, president of the conservative policy group Citizen Outreach, said Cannon is extremely vulnerable because of his position on amnesty for illegal aliens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This stunning setback can be blamed primarily on [Cannon&rsquo;s] pro-amnesty positions on illegal immigration,&rdquo; Muth remarked in a statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Joe Hunter, who serves as the chief of staff for Rep. Cannon, says he is amused that RightMarch.com would attempt to portray Cannon as a liberal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Characterizing Chris Cannon as a liberal is almost laughable,&rdquo; Hunter told <b>Talon News</b>. &ldquo;With the nonpartisan National Journal finding [Cannon] to be more conservative than 93% of all House Members, one has to question the threshold [RightMarch.com] is using to define liberals and conservatives &mdash; or one has to question their motivations.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hunter concluded to <b>Talon News</b>, &ldquo;Chris Cannon has a long and consistent record of conservative voting and representation, by almost any criteria.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The winner of the June 22 GOP primary race is expected to easily win in November since this is &ldquo;the most Republican district, in the most Republican State in the country,&rdquo; as noted by Greene. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Self-proclaimed as a group &ldquo;100% committed to its goal of defeating liberal Republican incumbents and replace them with true conservative Republicans,&rdquo; RightMarch.com promises to continue to target Republican lawmakers whom they believe do not vote conservative.
