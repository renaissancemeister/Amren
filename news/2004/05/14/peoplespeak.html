			<h1>
				Tony&rsquo;s &lsquo;Big Conversation&rsquo; Misfires
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>John Tyndall, Spearhead Online, May</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last December, in a typical Blairite stunt, it was announced that the Prime Minister would be engaging in what he called a &lsquo;Big Conversation&rsquo;. The idea was that people would e-mail to the Labour Party their views about how the Government was performing, and their views would be shown on the party&rsquo;s website. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the plan was that the e-mails would be carefully censored before being posted on the site, so as to ensure that Tony and his Government came out of the exercise covered with praise. One typical e-mail put on the site came from &lsquo;Kathy of Cheshire&rsquo; and it said: &ldquo;I have supported this Government through thick and thin, and I agree with 95 per cent of its policies.&rdquo; Ron, also of Cheshire, said: &ldquo;I now feel there is a Labour leader I can totally identify with. His name is Tony Blair.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the exercise hit a snag. Another website happened to have been set up with an almost identical name. This was <a href="https://www.bigconversation.org/">www.bigconversation.org</a>, operated by businessman Jamie Roy some time previously. E-mails sent to this site were uncensored and represented the &lsquo;real&rsquo; views of people about the Government. The site was bombarded with scathing attacks on Tony &amp; Co., many of them almost embarrassingly &lsquo;racist&rsquo;. The Labour spin-doctors were horrified. Said Mr. Roy: &ldquo;The Labour Party has hijacked our idea&hellip; Their project is a Big Con because they censor people&rsquo;s views. We are happy to publish all replies.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This crowd currently in charge of the country cannot even manage their own propaganda machine properly. What a bunch of no-hopers!
