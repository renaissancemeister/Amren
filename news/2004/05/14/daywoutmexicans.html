			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Laura Wides, AP, thestar online, May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LOS ANGELES (AP) &mdash; California is home to 12 million Hispanics, about one-third of the state&rsquo;s population. What if they all disappeared? 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Sergio Arau&rsquo;s new comedy &ldquo;A Day Without a Mexican,&rdquo; the answer is chaos. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cafes lose waiters, vegetables rot in the fields, schools are left without teachers and elected officials, including the lieutenant governor, vanish. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The idea of the film was to make the invisible visible,&rdquo; said Arau, a native of Mexico and the son of actor-director Alfonso Arau. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a car. If you take away a tire, you will notice.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The movie, which debuts Friday in Southern California, is scheduled to be released nationwide over the summer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s being distributed by Spanish-language media conglomerate Televisa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Filmed in a documentary style for nearly $2 million, it pokes fun at almost everyone in its effort to highlight the roles of Hispanics in U.S. society. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;So many films about immigration are very serious or tragic,&rdquo; said Arau, the film&rsquo;s director and co-writer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But humor is the best way to talk about serious themes because people relax and are more open.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arau&rsquo;s wife, Yareli Arizmendi, who appeared in his father&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Like Water for Chocolate,&rdquo; stars as TV reporter Lila Rodriguez, California&rsquo;s last Hispanic, whose search for the missing becomes the latest in reality TV. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As she searches, low-riders bounce driverless along the street and the Los Angeles Dodgers must cancel games because they don&rsquo;t have enough players &mdash; while the National Basketball Association remains unaffected. 
			</p>
			<p>
				UFO fanatics insist the Mexican sombrero is a replica of the spaceship that whisked the missing back to their planet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The film has particular meaning in the nation&rsquo;s most-populous state. 
			</p>
			<p>
				California has no majority ethnic population, with whites making up about 45 percent of the population and Hispanics 34 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to 2000 Census figures, Hispanics represent nearly a quarter of the state&rsquo;s kindergarten teachers, 20 percent of the state&rsquo;s police officers and 88 percent of its agricultural workers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet the economic and social contributions from Hispanics are often ignored, Arau said. He said that&rsquo;s especially true for immigrant laborers, whose cheap labor provides inexpensive goods and services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arau and Arizmendi, who co-wrote the script, came up with the idea in 1994, when former Gov. Pete Wilson was running for re-election on a platform that included a referendum barring illegal immigrants from receiving many social services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Proposition 187 was approved but was challenged in court and never took effect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month, a similar anti-immigrant initiative failed even to qualify for the November ballot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And although Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger helped repeal a law that would have given driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal immigrants, he said he would approve a similar law if it provides for more security checks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, illegal immigration remains a flashpoint. 
			</p>
			<p>
				U.S. Rep. Dan Rohrabacher recently proposed a bill requiring doctors to report patients&rsquo; immigration status to federal authorities; and President Bush has angered many members of Congress, including several in his own party, over his proposal for a guest-worker program that would allow many who illegally have entered the country to receive temporary work visas but limit the number who could apply for permanent residency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The film&rsquo;s own advertisements have caused a stir, too. Billboards based on the title were pulled down after passers-by, unaware of the film&rsquo;s subject, complained that they were offensive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arizmendi said many of the sentiments about Mexican immigrants that fueled support for Proposition 187 remain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Prop. 187 may no longer exist, but there&rsquo;s still these feelings of immigrants using and abusing services they don&rsquo;t deserve,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration issues are more complex than a film such as &ldquo;A Day Without a Mexican&rdquo; can explore, said Louis DeSipio, an associate professor of political science and Latino studies at the University of California, Irvine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, California attracts a disproportionate share of immigrants but doesn&rsquo;t receive enough federal money to offset associated costs for education, health care, law enforcement and other services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The film&rsquo;s greatest fault may be in attempting to tackle too many issues in one story, but Arau and Arizmendi said their goal is very simple. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People ask us, `What do you want people to do when they walk out of the theater?&rdquo;&rsquo; Arizmendi said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;All we want is that people go to dinner &hellip; and just keep your eyes open. See the complexity of the different people who are out there.&rdquo; &mdash; AP
