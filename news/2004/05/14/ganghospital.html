				Court papers cite a pattern of harassment and crime at the Oxnard center. An ER doctor says, &lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t had that many problems.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Holly J. Wolcott, L. A. Times, May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colonia Chiques gang members and associates have assaulted a hospital worker, intimidated patients and staff members and are responsible for thousands of dollars worth of vandalism at St. John&rsquo;s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, according to court documents filed by police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The pattern of harassment and crime at the city&rsquo;s only hospital was detailed in a civil lawsuit filed last month by Ventura County authorities against the county&rsquo;s largest and most violent gang. Police are seeking an injunction against the Chiques, linked to three dozen homicides in the past decade, to restrict their activities in the city. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrifying what&rsquo;s been going on,&rdquo; said prosecutor Karen Wold, who is handling the injunction filed on behalf of the Ventura County district attorney&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;Every time one of them [gang member] gets shot or stabbed, they create chaos at the hospital.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The typical gang member emergency usually results in 20 to 30 people showing up at the emergency room,&rdquo; according to Holland's affidavit, which includes graphic photographs of gunshot victims. &ldquo;The fellow gang members who flood the waiting room are very loud, bang on doors, are rude to staff and disruptive, and have no regard for other patients or hospital property.&rdquo; An emergency room nurse told police of how gang members, often covered in tattoos and spewing profanity, intimidate hospital staff members and emergency room personnel, creating a public nuisance in a place that is already stressful for all who are there. Police are regularly summoned, according to the affidavit.
