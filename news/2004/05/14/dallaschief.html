				<i>AP, AIM Today, May 10 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>DALLAS (AP) &mdash; After a nationwide search, the city ended up picking a homegrown candidate Monday to be the next police chief, filling a post that had been vacant since the top cop was fired nine months ago for poor job performance.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				David Kunkle, 53, was a former captain in Dallas who later served 17 years as police chief in the nearby communities of Grand Prairie and Arlington. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I look forward to returning the department to an organization all the citizens of Dallas can be proud of and support,&rdquo; Kunkle said. &ldquo;A department that not only reflects the community it serves but one that contributes significantly to the city&rsquo;s quality of life.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city has been without a police chief since August, when Terrell Bolton was fired after a tenure marred by questionable hiring practices and problems battling one of the highest per capita crime rates in the nation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As police chief in Arlington, Kunkle was credited with raising the department&rsquo;s standards while improving racial diversity and resident involvement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Dallas Police Department, regarded as one of the nation&rsquo;s most progressive law-enforcement agencies a generation ago, has struggled to restore its reputation after complaints about leadership and limited resources put a harsh spotlight on the 3,000-member force. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bolton, the city&rsquo;s first black police chief, stunned the department in 1999 by replacing the predominantly white command staff with one that was predominantly minority, sparking allegations that he promoted loyalty over performance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In internal reviews, officers also complained of staffing shortages, poor training and unreliable vehicles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Adding to the department&rsquo;s woes was a two-year investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department into allegations that dozens of Mexican immigrants were wrongly jailed after police informants planted fake cocaine on them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unrelated to the drug scandal, nearly a dozen officers were fired last year for having criminal records and violating department policies.
