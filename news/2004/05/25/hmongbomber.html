			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>L. A. Times, May 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A federal judge on Monday refused to throw out the government&rsquo;s strongest charges against a Garden Grove man accused of using a bomb as a weapon of mass destruction outside an Orange County congresswoman&rsquo;s office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney ruled against Hai Duc Le, 35, whose attorney asked that two counts of a new four-count indictment be dismissed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Le faces charges of using a weapon of mass destruction, carrying a destructive device, possession of an unregistered firearm &mdash; in this case, a pipe bomb &mdash; and illegally making a destructive device. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bomb, which was filled with roofing nails, blew up in Le&rsquo;s lap while he was inside his car on June 15, 2003, parked next to the campaign office of Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Anaheim). He was severely scarred. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Charges against Le&rsquo;s brother, Hien Duc Le, 33, were dropped. The brother was accused of being an accessory after the fact, a count related to the alleged bomb-making, and obstruction of justice.
