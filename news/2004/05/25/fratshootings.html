				Teen Killed, Man Wounded Outside Club Hosting Fraternity Event In Dallas
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Fox23 (NY), May 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				DALLAS (AP) &mdash; A teenager was killed, a man was wounded and a car full of young women was sprayed with bullets during shootings outside a fraternity event at a downtown banquet hall, police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 1,500 people milling about outside Eddie Deen&rsquo;s Ranch had been denied entry to the event hosted by two chapters of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity on Saturday night, police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pierre Malone, 16, was shot in the back and arm as he tried to flee in a car with six friends. He died in the arms of a friend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There were 15 of them coming after us,&rdquo; said Mark Omere, a high school senior who had been standing in line with Malone outside the club. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 20-year-old man was hit in the leg about the same time Malone was killed; investigators were looking into whether he was caught in the crossfire of that shooting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier in the night, a 19-year-old woman and her two friends told police a man from another car fired at their silver Ford Mustang with an assault-style weapon. Their car had to be towed after bullets punctured the gas tank, but the occupants were not injured. Police arrested a man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fire marshals at the club enforced occupancy limits throughout the night at the &ldquo;Ice Storm II&rdquo; party. The Fraternity chapters hosting the event were from the University of North Texas and Texas A&M-Commerce.

				Alpha Legacy: A Brief History
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Alpha Phi Alpha website</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders, known as the &ldquo;Jewels&rdquo; of the Fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejudice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha&rsquo;s principles of scholarship, fellowship, good character, and the uplifting of humanity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alpha Phi Alpha chapters were developed at other colleges and universities, many of them historically black institutions, soon after the founding at Cornell. While continuing to stress academic excellence among its members, Alpha also recognized the need to help correct the educational, economic, political, and social injustices faced by African-Americans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alpha Phi Alpha has long stood at the forefront of the African-American community&rsquo;s fight for civil rights through leaders such as: W.E.B. DuBois, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Edward Brooke, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Andrew Young, William Gray, Paul Robeson, and many others.
