			</h1>

				<i>Marietie Louw, news24.com (SA), May 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Johannesburg &mdash; In what is believed to be the third farm attack in a week, a Heidelberg farmer was shot dead on Friday in Gauteng while in his mielie fields. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Four men apparently attacked Eddie Jordaan, 71, shortly after 09:00 while he was selling mielies on his farm, said superintendent Andy Pieke of East Rand police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two shots were fired. One hit the farmer in the chest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Pieke, the attackers fled with Jordaan&rsquo;s cellphone, about R5 000 and his firearm. Some left the scene in a black Citi Golf while others fled on foot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pieke said that Jordaan was rushed to hospital, but was declared dead on arrival. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chris van Zyl, security chief for the Transvaal Agricultural Union, said on Friday that the murder was unsettling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We heard rumours earlier this week that Jordaan had been warned of a possible attack and that worries us.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jordaan had been a Conservative Party MP between 1989 and 1992. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pieter Groenewald of the Freedom Front Plus said on Friday the party would ask the department of safety and security to look into farm attacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Gunmen didn&rsquo;t take a thing</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this week, Henk Fourie, 29, of Varkenskraal in the Groblersdal district in Mpumalanga, was gunned down in cold blood. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dina Fourie, his sister, said on Friday: &ldquo;It was murder. The murderers did not even take five cents out of my brother&rsquo;s bakkie. They took nothing.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourie and his wife, Shirley, were attacked on their farm after returning from town. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When Fourie stopped to open a farm gate he spotted two armed men in the veld. The men opened fire on the couple. Fourie was shot in the back. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to his sister, a box containing dagga was found near the scene of the shooting. No one has been arrested yet in connection with the crime. p&gt;Diana said: &ldquo;It would bring a lot of peace if the murderers were caught. Unfortunately, it will not bring my brother back.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fourie will be buried from the NG Kerk in Groblersdal at 10:00 on Tuesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The South African farmer who was murdered on a farm in the Tuli block in Botswana last week will also be buried on Tuesday.
