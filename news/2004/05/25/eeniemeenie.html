				<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,11374,1220735,00.html">&lsquo;Racist&rsquo; Advert Dropped</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Hugh Muir, The Guardian, May 20 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Posters for an ice-cream advert condemned for being racially offensive are to be taken down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				MasterFoods, makers of Galaxy ice-cream, apologised yesterday for racial insensitivity and scrapped the campaign which used the children&rsquo;s rhyme &ldquo;Eeny, meeny, miney, mo&rdquo;. Activists complained that a well-known version of the rhyme ended &ldquo;catch a nigger by his toe&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The slogan was part of a national campaign that featured a picture of the chocolate ice-cream and four spoons of various sizes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among those who complained were the group Operation Black Vote, the Black Londoners Forum and the 1990 Trust. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokeswoman for MasterFoods said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t realise that we caused offence by putting the advert up &hellip; We will have the advert down by the end of this week.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				MasterFoods thanked the campaigners for raising the issue, saying the rhyme was meant to indicate choice and &ldquo;apologised for any offence&rdquo;. 
			</p>

				<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1219908,00.html">Advertisement Denounced As Racist</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Hugh Muir, The Guardian, May 19 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				An advertisement encouraging lovers of chocolate ice cream to indulge themselves has triggered a controversy over &ldquo;racist&rdquo; nursery rhymes and prompted threats of a consumer boycott. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A coalition of black groups is protesting against manufacturers Masterfoods, claiming that its use of the nursery rhyme &ldquo;Eeny, meeny, miney, mo&rdquo; in an advertisement for Galaxy ice cream is racially offensive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the poster, five spoons, ranging from the small to the outsized, are pictured with the ice cream, the concept being that the consumer uses the counting rhyme &ldquo;Eeny, meeny, miny, mo&rdquo; to select one. The rhyme is controversial because one widely known version of it continues &ldquo;catch a nigger by his toe&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Campaigners, who want the ad withdrawn, are taking their cue from the United States, where a court has ruled that just reciting the rhyme can be racially offensive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Simon Woolley, coordinator of Operation Black Vote, said: &ldquo;They are using a nursery rhyme which many people know as being profoundly racist and brutal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The amazing thing is what this says about the advertising industry. It shows how few minorities there are in senior roles in these companies.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He denied the campaign is pandering to political correctness. &ldquo;What part of politically correct don&rsquo;t people understand. Is the word &lsquo;nigger&rsquo; acceptable?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rhyme is believed to have been around in various forms since the 1850s. Some historians say they were Celtic Druid counting words. Less contentious versions replace the offensive word with &ldquo;tiger&rdquo;. In another, the subject to be caught is a &ldquo;fishy&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the rhyme has a particular resonance in the US where slaves in the South became accustomed to hearing it in its most offensive form. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokeswoman for Masterfoods said the company had been surprised by the complaints. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe the ad is racist,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is a common phrase indicating choice. We would never intentionally put out an advert to cause offence.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sensitivity to the use of racist language was highlighted last month by the disgracing of television pundit Ron Atkinson, who called Chelsea&rsquo;s French defender Marcel Desailly a &ldquo;lazy nigger&rdquo;, oblivious to the fact that his microphone was switched on. Mr Atkinson felt obliged to resign from his television job and to relinquish his sports column in the Guardian.
