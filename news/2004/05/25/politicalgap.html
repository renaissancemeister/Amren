				Racial Gap At Capitol Widens
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Whites fill GOP slate; minorities line Democrats&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Ben Smith, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 22 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Georgia Legislature, the difference between Democrats and Republicans is growing more black and white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				African-Americans and other minorities could be a couple of elections away from becoming a majority among Democratic candidates running for the General Assembly. The Republican slate, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly white and male, according to an analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The newspaper, relying on the state&rsquo;s voter registration database, campaign Web sites and some interviews with candidates, matched the racial classifications of 500 Republican and Democratic state legislative office seekers.The analysis found that of the 272 Republicans running for the state House and Senate, 224 are white men. Among Democratic legislative candidates, 127 are white and 101 are African-Americans or other minorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among otherfindings: 
			</p>
			<p>
				 &mdash;  In a party once dominated by rural whites, African-Americans and other minorities outnumber white candidates among Democrats under the age of 50. 
			</p>
			<p>
				 &mdash;  The increase in the number of black Republicans running for the Legislature &mdash; from 11 in 2002 to 15 in a field of 272 candidates in 2004 &mdash; is marginal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				 &mdash;  The increase in white men running as Republicans since 2002 far outpaced the number of women and minorities seeking GOP nominations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The change in the racial makeup of the candidates &ldquo;is tracking what we&rsquo;ve already seen in the electorate: the Republicanization of white men,&rdquo; said Emory University political scientist Merle Black. &ldquo;Over the 1990s, there&rsquo;s been a massive shift of white voters out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party,&rdquo; Black said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The result is a field of legislative candidates that mirrors the electorate in many respects. For example, Black said, 72 percent of white men,excluding independent voters, identified themselves as Republican. That number was up from 60 percent in 1992. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the current crop of legislative candidates, 67 percent of the white men are running as Republicans. While the GOP added two female candidates and four African-Americans to its slate since the 2002 elections, there are an additional 50 white male Republican candidates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Bipartisan problems</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Political experts say the migration of white voters and potential officeholders into the GOP bodes ill for the Democratic Party. It could be relegated to permanent status as a minor party if African-Americans become its majority, some of the experts say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, a continued failure by the GOP to attract more minorities could pose long-term problems for Republicans as the nation grows more racially diverse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				William Boone, a Clark Atlanta University political science professor, said the math is simple for Democrats. A party dominated by racial minorities in a state that is 65 percent white cannot be the dominant political force in Georgia. The GOP, he said, faces a longer-term problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the short term, the Republicans can win enough seats to take the House [and] maintain control of the Senate and the governorship, but [attracting white voters to switch] is not a strategy for the future,&rdquo; said Boone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear from the census [that] things are going to change radically by the next one.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Boone was referring to a steady influx of ethnic groups that could render white residents a minority midway through the 21st century. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Parties tout diversity</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Democratic and Republican leaders painted more positive pictures of racial progress within their parties. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is a diverse state and we are a diverse party,&rdquo; said Bobby Kahn, Georgia Democratic Party chairman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;[The loss of white voters] was clearly a problem in the 2002 election. But I think the economy is going to bring a fair number of them back. There are concerns about the economy and not having a job and not having a job with decent pay.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				State Republican Party Chairman Alec Poitevint said, &ldquo;We now have a large enough group of [nonwhite] people who are viewed as leaders in their community, and they have very positive chances of being elected.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state GOP made history last month when Willie Talton, chief deputy of the Houston County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, signed up to run for a House seat. Talton almost assuredly was guaranteed to win by default when the qualifying period ended last month without any major party opponent signing up. No third party or write-in candidate has announced an intention to run for the seat. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether Talton could become a novelty as the lone black Republican in the Legislature or become the start of a trend in state GOP politics depends on whether any of the 14 other African-Americans prevail in this year&rsquo;s contested elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All but four are running in metro Atlanta, not a fertile ground for successful black Republican candidacies, according to one who tried before and failed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Black voters &ldquo;just could not separate black Republican candidates from the stigmatism of white Republicans,&rdquo; Scott Davis, who chairs the South DeKalb Republican Party, said about his unsuccessful House bid in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Metro divide deeper?</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Davis believes the geographic and social distance between black and white people in much of metro Atlanta is greater than in Middle Georgia and in South Georgia, where he thinks another conservative black Republican like Talton could succeed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In those small towns, black and white people are more likely to go to the same schools, the same grocery stores, and are more forced to interact with each other,&rdquo; Davis added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Political scientist Black said the GOP&rsquo;s problems in attracting minorities are not nearly as severe as the hemorrhaging of white voters from the Democratic Party. But Black said he sees an unrealized opportunity for Democrats: The party isn&rsquo;t running enough female candidates, particularly white women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Exit polls for the 2000 elections showed most Democratic voters were white women, followed by African-American women. But white and black women are a vast minority of Democratic candidates for the Legislature this year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Democrats might have more success in Georgia if they run centrist candidates &mdash; not liberal ones &mdash; who are women,&rdquo; said Black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One candidate attempting that feat is Dawn Randolph, once an aide to former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn. She is running in an area of Henry County that is majority Republican but has seen an influx of Democratic voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Randolph said she isn&rsquo;t surprised more women don&rsquo;t opt to run for elected office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Most women are juggling many roles, working full time, motherhood and managing a household,&rdquo; said Randolph, who is married but doesn&rsquo;t have children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t a lot of women who can take on another almost full-time job and get paid part-time money.&rdquo; 
			</p>
