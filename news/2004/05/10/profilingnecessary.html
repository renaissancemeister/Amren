			<h1>
				Lynn Minority Leaders Say Racial Profiling Necessary
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>David Liscio, Daily Item of Lynn (MA), May 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>L</b>YNN &mdash; A study released this week accusing Lynn police of racial profiling when making traffic stops is not causing alarm among the city&rsquo;s minority leaders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the study by Northeastern University states that the Police Department failed in four of four categories, a ranking shared by other large cities statewide, the head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said profiling is simply part of police work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to look like I&rsquo;m picking on certain nationalities, but I don&rsquo;t know how some of these people get their driver&rsquo;s licenses,&rdquo; said Abner Darby, executive director of the North Shore branch of the NAACP. &ldquo;There are certain groups of people in the city who are breaking the law, so when police see the tags on their plates aren&rsquo;t right, or their inspection stickers are expired, they stop them. These people are lawbreakers, so the police are just making them do what they should be doing. It&rsquo;s a safety issue.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Darby said drivers often park across the crosswalk or in the handicapped zone near the Community Minority Cultural Center on Union Street with little regard for pedestrians or other motorists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I confront them they don&rsquo;t speak English, so they cuss me or give me the finger. I&rsquo;m not a racist, but this is total disrespect and ignorance.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Darby, profiling is a tool used by police officers on the lookout for wrongdoing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here in Lynn since 1956, so I&rsquo;ve seen it all. I come from Texas, and I can tell you about racial profiling. I don&rsquo;t see that kind of thing here. But as I said, right outside my building the police could be ticketing and easily make back three salaries. Those people out there, they may be my color, but they ain&rsquo;t my kind.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Damon Harrison, longtime minority-rights activist in Lynn, said he has been stopped by police but does not consider himself victimized by racial profiling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s somewhat of a necessary part of a police officer&rsquo;s job,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like if they were on patrol in Harlem, N.Y. at 2 a.m. and didn&rsquo;t stop three blond-haired, blue-eyed Irishmen to see what they were doing.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Harrison said it&rsquo;s more a matter of how police stop suspects rather than why. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m walking in Marblehead at 3 a.m., some officer would be negligent if he didn&rsquo;t stop to ask if I need help. But if they stop me, put me up against the car and start slapping me around, that&rsquo;s a different story,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lynn has become increasingly diverse during the past decade, Harrison said, adding that poor people from ethnic minorities tend to have more issues when stopped by police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This really all comes down to an individual officer&rsquo;s biases. If an officer has a complaint of brutality on his record and then gets accused of racial profiling, maybe there&rsquo;s something to it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just think the police should stop denying it, say it&rsquo;s part of their job and ask how to do it better.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result of the study, the state is ordering 249 police departments to collect a year&rsquo;s worth of data on all traffic stops. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lynn and Peabody were among 15 departments that failed in all categories; a group that included Boston, Worcester and Springfield. Lynn Police Chief John Suslak joined dozens of chiefs statewide in harsh criticism of the study&rsquo;s methodology. As Suslak put it, &ldquo;If 242 communities are in violation of racial profiling, are we measuring the right stuff here?&rdquo;
