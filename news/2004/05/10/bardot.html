				Bardot In Tears At Race-Hate Trial
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Reuters, May 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PARIS (Reuters) &mdash; Brigitte Bardot, the French former film goddess turned animal-rights activist, broke down in tears when she left a Paris courtroom after testifying at her latest trial on charges of inciting racial hatred. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bardot, 69, previously convicted of similar offences, is on trial over her book &ldquo;A Scream in the Silence&rdquo;, an outspoken attack on gays, immigrants and the jobless which shocked France. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bardot, in her 1960s heyday the epitome of French feminine beauty, told Thursday&rsquo;s hearing that France was going through a period of decadence and said she opposed inter-racial marriage. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I was born in 1934, at that time inter-racial marriage wasn&rsquo;t approved of,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of her prose style, Bardot said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Balzac&rdquo;, a reference to the 19th century French literary great. That drew a wry, &ldquo;The court had noticed,&rdquo; from the presiding judge. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In her book, the former film idol attacks homosexuals as &ldquo;fairground freaks&rdquo;, condemns the presence of women in government and denounces the &ldquo;scandal of unemployment benefit&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She also criticised the &ldquo;Islamisation of France&rdquo; &mdash; which has a five million strong Muslim minority &mdash; and the &ldquo;underground and dangerous infiltration of Islam&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The book, published last year, dismayed a country whose national football team was held up as a model of the nation&rsquo;s ethnic integration following its 1998 World Cup victory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The passages prompted anti-racism groups to launch legal proceedings against the former star, who turned her back on cinema after 46 films to concentrate on animal welfare. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bardot denies the charges, saying her book did not target Islam or people from North Africa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No stranger to controversy, she was fined $3,250 in January 1998 for inciting racial hatred in comments about civilian massacres in Algeria. Four months earlier, a court fined her for saying France was being overrun by sheep-slaughtering Muslims.
