			<h1>
				Parliament Takes Steps To Tighten Immigration
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Swiss parliamentarians have voted in favour of a series of measures aimed at tightening the country&rsquo;s immigration laws. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>NZZ Online (Switzerland), May 8</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the proposed legislation foreigners from outside the European Union will only be allowed to take up jobs if no Swiss candidates are available. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite opposition from the centre-left Social Democrats, the House of Representatives voted in favour of giving priority to EU and European Free Trade Association (Efta) citizens who seek employment in Switzerland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The proposed two-tier immigration policy is part of a package of measures which will continue to be debated when parliamentarians meet again in June. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This week&rsquo;s special session of parliament focused exclusively on proposals to reform the country&rsquo;s asylum and immigration laws. 
			</p>
			<h5>
				Polarisation
			</h5>
			<p>
				The justice minister, Christoph Blocher, said the week-long debate had demonstrated that the polarisation of Left and Right in Swiss politics &ldquo;continues to exist&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;[This week&rsquo;s debate] ended as it had to end,&rdquo; said Blocher. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Social Democrat Christine Goll said the discussions showed how &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; Switzerland was on issues of asylum and migration in Europe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hans Fehr of the rightwing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party described the debate as &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some proposals aimed at curbing the number of immigrants were thrown out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One, supported by the government, sought to restrict immigration from outside the EU to highly skilled labour and people with special qualifications. 
			</p>
			<h5>
				Discriminatory
			</h5>
			<p>
				Had the proposals been accepted, argued the Social Democrats, Switzerland would have sent a signal to the outside world that the country was promoting an &ldquo;elitist and discriminatory&rdquo; immigration policy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hans Fehr failed in his bid to convince the House of the need to introduce a quota on the number of foreigners allowed to take up residence in Switzerland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Foreigners living in Switzerland currently make up 20.1 per cent of the population. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The People&rsquo;s Party was more successful in winning support, albeit by a narrow majority, for a proposal to give foreign workers access to low-paid jobs in the agriculture, tourism and construction sectors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the party failed to persuade the House to reintroduce seasonal work permits. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Illegal immigrants may, however, see their chances of staying in Switzerland improved after the House came out in favour of a Social Democratic plan to reassess their status, provided they have lived in the country for more than four years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That proposal scraped through with a wafer-thin majority of one vote. 
			</p>
			<h5>
				Repatriation accord
			</h5>
			<p>
				During the session the House of Representatives also voted in favour of ratifying a controversial repatriation accord with Nigeria. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reciprocal agreement &mdash; the first of its kind with an African country &mdash; means the Swiss authorities can forcibly repatriate Nigerian citizens who do not have the legal right to remain in Switzerland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Swiss government came under fire from human rights groups when the treaty was signed last year by the former justice minister, Ruth Metzler. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this week parliamentarians also voted to crack down on asylum seekers arriving from so-called &ldquo;safe countries&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A new law &mdash; which like all others debated this week also needs Senate approval &mdash; will permit cuts in development aid to countries which refuse to take back rejected asylum requests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But amid the stricter legislation there was one relaxation: a policy of accepting refugees on humanitarian grounds has taken a step closer to becoming law.
