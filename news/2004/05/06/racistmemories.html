				Readers&rsquo; Memories Of Crime Stories Influenced By Racial Stereotypes
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Penn State Live, May 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Thursday, May 6, 2004</b> University Park, Pa. &mdash; If asked to imagine a criminal suspect, certain mental pictures come to mind for most people. According to a recent Penn State study concerning people&rsquo;s memory of news photographs, images that accentuate African-American facial features would be common, and particularly if the crime is violent rather than non-violent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our data suggest that when reading news about violent crime, people seem to unconsciously recall images associated with African-Americans, reflecting the influence of stereotypes on memory,&rdquo; says Dr. Mary Beth Oliver, associate professor of media studies in the University&rsquo;s College of Communications. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the study, the researchers asked 163 undergraduate college students, of whom 147 were White, to examine one of four types of news stories, all about a hypothetical Black man with a fictitious name. The first, about a college professor winning an award, did not contain stereotypical metaphors or language. The second, regarding a basketball player, was stereotyped but not about crime. The third story, regarding embezzlement from a union, dealt with non-violent crime, while the fourth focused on violent crime, specifically a burglary-murder. All four stories included an identical photograph of the same man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Subsequent to reading the story, participants reconstructed the photograph of the individual by selecting from a series of facial features (i.e. noses, mouths, skin tones) presented on a computer screen,&rdquo; Oliver says. &ldquo;Although selected features did not differ from the actual photograph in the non-stereotyped and stereotyped/non-crime conditions, selected facial features for the crime stories featured more pronounced African-American than European-American features, particularly for the story concerning violent crime.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, readers appeared largely unaware of their associations of violent crime with the physical characteristics of African-Americans, Oliver notes. The associations were present among the participants regardless of their self-reported racial attitudes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We believe our results are noteworthy the importance of visual information in a variety of law-enforcement scenarios,&rdquo; Oliver says. &ldquo;If African-American features are stereotypically associated with crime, this has implications for identifications in line-ups, for racial profiling, and for criminal prosecutions, among many other types of situations.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Oliver is lead author of the article, &ldquo;The Face of Crime: Viewers&rsquo; Memory of Race-Related Facial Features of Individuals Pictured in the News,&rdquo; which appeared recently in the Journal of Communication. Her co-authors are: Dr. Ronald Jackson II, associate professor of communication arts; and Nididi Moses and Celnisha L. Dangerfield, both former graduate students at Penn State. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Given that people report that news is their most important source of crime information, it&rsquo;s imperative that we look further at how viewers&rsquo; interpretations and memory of crime news can act to sustain racism,&rdquo; Oliver says. &ldquo;The idea that this type of stereotyping may occur largely outside of viewers&rsquo; awareness will make it particularly challenging to curb these kinds of responses.&rdquo;
