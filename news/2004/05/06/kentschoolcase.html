			<h1>
				<a href="https://www.komotv.com/stories/31072.htm">Kent School District Insurance Rejects NAACP $40 Million Claim</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Leslie Knopp, komo news, May 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				KENT &mdash; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s twisted my arm and handcuffed me many times,&rdquo; said one student when racism claims against Kent Schools were made public a couple months ago. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The students, all African-American, claim the policy is racist because it&rsquo;s only used on black students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A dozen Kent students and the NAACP filed claims against the district for $40 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But on Monday the district&rsquo;s insurance company, the School Insurance Association of Washington, denied those claims, siding with the district&rsquo;s own investigation, that school security did nothing wrong. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Having the insurance association confirm our findings gives us even more confidence in those findings,&rdquo; said Barbara Grohme, Kent Schools Superintendent 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Sakara Remmu of King County&rsquo;s NAACP says this isn&rsquo;t the end of the case: 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is about our children our most precious commodity, our future. We&rsquo;re not going to let this case go. If they don&rsquo;t want to hear us in the board room, they will in the court room.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The NAACP says it will now help the students and their families file lawsuits against the district. They will argue the discipline violated students&rsquo; civil rights because it interfered with their education. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Does the NAACP think that this superintendent and her actions that this school district are racist? Absolutely we think they&rsquo;re racists,&rdquo; said Carl Mack of the NAACP. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The district still has an independent review panel investigating. But, while that happens, the district&rsquo;s discipline policy still stands: security may use handcuffs as a form of discipline, if absolutely necessary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I would hope that a better approach than litigation would be to get together and work with these students to be more successful,&rdquo; said Grohme.
