				<b>Review of DON&rsquo;T PLAY IN THE SUN</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>One Woman&rsquo;s Journey Through the Color Complex</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				By Marita Golden 
			</p>
			<p>
				Doubleday. 195 pp. $23.95 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marita Golden has written a fascinating and frustrating book. Her target is the intraracial warfare that supposedly rages between light &mdash; and dark-skinned blacks. My frustration starts with the title, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Play in the Sun.&rdquo; This was the perennial warning that Golden&rsquo;s mother shouted at her. The meaning was clear: The sun would further darken her skin and make her an even greater object of contempt and scorn by whites and light-complexioned blacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My mother shouted the same words at me and commanded that I wear a cap when I went out to play. Though my mother warned me not to play in the sun, she did not deny her blackness. She was light enough to pass for white but angrily rejected any suggestion that she do so. She did not thumb her nose at darker-skinned blacks, and that certainly included my very brown-skinned father. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Golden&rsquo;s view, those with dark skin are not just Ralph Ellison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Invisible Man&rdquo; but also Richard Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;Outsider.&rdquo; They are perpetually banished to the outer fringe of society. Dark skin damns you to a life sentence of dirty jobs, poor education and failed relationships. As Golden bluntly puts it, &ldquo;Light skin equals privilege, power, and influence.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				Golden blames white society for saddling a curse-of-Ham complex of self-hatred on blacks: &ldquo;Whites constructed the color complex and imposed a system of rewards and punishments to uphold it, and its insidious results shape nearly every aspect of life in this country, working hand in glove with racism.&rdquo; She passionately argues that the color complex, and the vicious stereotypes it conjures, have proven most devastating for dark-skinned black women.
