				<a href="http://www.blackelectorate.com/articles.asp?ID=1121">High Court Allows Preferences For Builders</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Greg Stohr, Bloomberg News, BlackElectorate.com, May 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Supreme Court refused Monday to question a federal program that funnels billions of dollars for highway construction to companies owned by racial minorities and women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The justices, without comment, turned aside two challenges to the program by white-owned Minnesota and Nebraska companies. The Bush administration, which has opposed affirmative action in other contexts, defended the so-called set-asides. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules apply to more than $20 billion allocated by the Transportation Department to state and local agencies every year. The program, which requires that 10 percent of the money go to so-called disadvantaged business enterprises, has been under legal attack for more than a decade. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This case presents questions of fundamental national importance,&rdquo; said an unsuccessful appeal filed by family-owned Gross Seed Co., which lost a contract for seeding work on a Nebraska project even though it was the low bidder at $255,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The issue of federal highway set-asides has come before the high court repeatedly in the past decade, starting with a 1995 case that laid out a demanding test for federal affirmative action programs. The justices said the Constitution&rsquo;s equal protection clause requires such programs to be &ldquo;narrowly tailored&rdquo; to meet a &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; interest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The question in the latest case was whether the current version of the set-aside program meets that test. An appeals court in St. Louis said the policy was constitutional. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Bush administration said the Transportation Department program is a remedial effort established by Congress to compensate for a long history of discrimination in the industry. Congress reauthorized the program in 1998 through a law known as the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Congress had evidence that minority &mdash; and woman-owned businesses &ldquo;continue to suffer the effects of discrimination that adversely affect their ability to participate on an equal opportunity basis in highway construction,&rdquo; U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson said in a court filing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Supreme Court previously said federal agencies can use racial preferences to compensate for past discrimination against minority contractors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The companies challenging the program said the remedial justification is a sham. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Congress did not find discrimination when it enacted TEA &mdash; 21, nor did it even look for it,&rdquo; said Sherbrooke Turf Inc., a landscaping company based in Pelican Rapids, Minn. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under federal rules, businesses are presumed to be disadvantaged if they are majority-owned by women, blacks, Hispanics, American Indians or Asian Americans. That presumption is rebutted for individuals with a personal net worth of more than $750,000, excluding ownership of the company and equity in a primary residence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				States must set percentage goals for disadvantaged contractors on projects funded with federal money. Nebraska had a goal of 11 percent participation by disadvantaged businesses in its fiscal year 2000 and 9.95 percent in fiscal 2001. Minnesota&rsquo;s goal was 11.6 percent in 2001. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rules require states to try to reach their goals through race-neutral means before resorting to preferences for disadvantaged businesses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The regulations prohibit the use of quotas and permit set-asides only in the most egregious instances of otherwise irremediable discrimination,&rdquo; the Bush administration argued. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The administration urged the Supreme Court not to hear the appeals, saying lower courts have unanimously upheld the program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Supreme Court gave affirmative action a limited endorsement in its latest cases, two disputes over race-based admissions at the University of Michigan. The justices said universities seeking to further campus diversity could consider race as part of an individualized review of applications.
