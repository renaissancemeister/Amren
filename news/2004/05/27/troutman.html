				Gang Leaders Helped Elect Troutman
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Annie Sweeney, Chic. Sun-Times, May 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ald. Arenda Troutman said Tuesday she met with top gang members under the impression they were legitimate businessmen and accepted help from them during elections &mdash; but she refused to comment on whether she had a personal relationship with one of them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At a press briefing packed with more than 100 of her supporters who shouted down reporters asking questions, Troutman said alleged Black Disciples Marvel Thompson and Donnell Jehan came to her 20th Ward offices as &ldquo;businessmen&rdquo; who shared her concerns about helping people in the community get ahead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said she only found out they were gang members when they were indicted on May 13 for allegedly running a brutal drug empire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When they came through the door, they looked like what they said they were &mdash; businessmen. They talked like businessmen. They were dressed like businessmen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They had business to discuss. There was no way for me to know they were anything other than businesspeople.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said they acted professionally in her company. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They have helped me in my election,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They have helped many elected officials in their elections. Their concern was my concern . . . trying to help the helpless, give hope to the hopeless.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The federal government, though, says Thompson is &ldquo;king&rdquo; of the Black Disciples who was more concerned with overseeing an enterprise that raked in up to $300,000 a day in drug sales and laundered money through a variety of businesses, including real estate, construction and a recording studio. Thompson was arrested two weeks ago along with 30 of his underlings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jehan was accused in the indictment of controlling drug sales from the Dan Ryan Expy. to Cottage Grove and from 61st to 71st. Jehan, also known as &ldquo;Big Scan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scandalous,&rdquo; is a fugitive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Chicago Sun-Times reported within a week of the indictments that an envelope from the Chicago Police Department addressed to Troutman was found in the hands of the gang during a May 12 raid. Her attorney confirmed that two envelopes from police were found. And on Tuesday, a source said Jehan has been at her South Side home and has, on occasion, driven her SUV. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Troutman spent a good portion of the news conference touting the projects she has supported in the ward and suggesting that because she represents some of the city&rsquo;s poorest and most dangerous areas, it is likely she will meet with criminals and those who don&rsquo;t fit the &ldquo;status quo.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But when asked specifics about her relationship to Jehan, she spoke in generalities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Regarding the envelopes, the alderman said she often reuses envelopes that come to her office. When constituents come in to pick up information, her staff will put paperwork inside an old envelope. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Those envelopes were there not out of any inappropriate relationship,&rdquo; said her attorney, Sam Adam Jr. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As for whether Jehan has ever driven her SUV, the alderman said, &ldquo;For years, I have let everybody drive my car.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And when asked to confirm a television report that her brother said she had a &ldquo;personal relationship&rdquo; with Jehan, Troutman dodged the question. &ldquo;Are you going to take what I said? Or what Ben said? If you want to talk to Ben, you can go and interview Ben.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Troutman also talked about her own family&rsquo;s struggle with drugs and said she would never associate with anyone bringing that &ldquo;poison&rdquo; into the community. &ldquo;There is no way I would be involved with any criminal activity. No way. &hellip; I understand what dope has done to my community.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Adam said the alderman was interviewed by federal authorities for three hours last week about the envelopes. He said she is not a target of an investigation or suspected of anything. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;At no time does the FBI or the U.S. attorney or any state government accuse this alderman of any wrongdoing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We took her down and she answered each and every question. And gave an honest answer, a responsible answer.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The news conference began with the claps and cheers of Troutman&rsquo;s supporters and ended when they heckled reporters asking for details. The confusion spilled into the street, where shouts were hurled at one community activist who said he was not satisfied with Troutman&rsquo;s answers about her relationship with Jehan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Rev. Gregory Daniels, who leads a group called United Voters for Truth and Change, was there with 50 people who he said had confidence in Troutman. Ald. Freddrenna Lyle (6th) also was there in support, along with former gang enforcer Wallace &ldquo;Gator&rdquo; Bradley, who defended Troutman outside. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But also among the crowd was David E. Neely, an attorney and lifetime resident of the ward. Neely said he came by himself to find out what Troutman had to say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like what I see so far,&rdquo; said Neely. &ldquo;What I see here is an appearance of impropriety. There&rsquo;s a lot of gang activity, a lot of drug dealing. I think an alderman of this ward has to be someone who is going to stand up against this kind of activity.&rdquo;

				Troutman&rsquo;s Brother Arrested In Drug Sting
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Annie Sweeney, Chic. Sun-Times, May 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The brother of Ald. Arenda Troutman (20th) was arrested this week in a drug-related sting -- just three hours before she held a news conference to address reports, including one from him, that she was connected to top gang members in Chicago. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Benjamin Troutman was arrested about 8 a.m. Tuesday during a sting at the Ida B. Wells development on the South Side, said Public Housing Acting Cmdr. Theodore Davis. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A reverse sting to dealers in the area had been planned for a couple of weeks and was based on complaints of drug activity, Davis said. Thirty people were arrested in the sting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chicago police officers saw Troutman, 52, toss a small item into his mouth that he later admitted was narcotics, said Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden. Troutman also allegedly said he came to the area to purchase drugs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was treated at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Camden said. He was charged with a misdemeanor, criminal trespassing to state land, because he was found on Chicago Housing Authority property. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ald. Troutman, a 13-year member of the Council, held a news conference later Tuesday to address allegations about her links to members of the Black Disciples gang -- including one her brother made to a television reporter that she had a personal relationship with Donnell Jehan, a top-ranking member. Jehan was named in an indictment announced two weeks ago by federal prosecutors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the news conference, Ald. Troutman said she knew Jehan and Marvel Thompson, the alleged &ldquo;king&rdquo;of the gang who is in custody, only as businessmen who were looking for ways to help the community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ald. Troutman, 46, was first linked to the gang when two envelopes from the Chicago Police Department that were addressed to her were found during a raid on the gang. Sources have also said Jehan has been at her home and driven her SUV in her South Side neighborhood. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When asked at the news conference about her brother&rsquo;s allegations, Troutman said, &ldquo;Are you going to take what I said? Or what Ben said?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She refused to answer questions Wednesday about her brother&rsquo;s arrest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about arrests,&rdquo; she said at a City Council meeting. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t talk to me, please.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation announced it has suspended Jehan&rsquo;s security guard license. The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday that Jehan, 36, was put on one-year probation in March after he disclosed a previous criminal conviction to the department. One condition of that probation was that Jehan was not allowed to apply for a permit to carry a firearm. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Mr. Jehan is a dangerous fugitive .. . and it is imperative that he is stripped of any credential that might lend him any legitimacy,&rdquo; department director Fernando Grillo said. 
			</p>

				Alderman Questioned On How Gang Got Letter From Cops
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Frank Main, Natasha Korecki, and Fran Spielman, Chic. Sun-Times, May 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ald. Arenda Troutman appeared Thursday at the Dirksen Federal Building, where authorities wanted to know why an envelope addressed to her -- with a return address to the Chicago Police Department -- wound up in the hands of the Black Disciples street gang. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She re-emerged after about two hours but would not answer reporters&rsquo; questions. Wearing a color-splashed sun dress and dark shades, she shielded her face at times from cameras. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sam Adam, a criminal defense attorney, ushered her out of the building and into a cab, saying only that he might have a statement later. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Sun-Times reported Wednesday that the envelope was discovered during last week&rsquo;s raid on the Black Disciples by Chicago Police and the FBI. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Reputed gang kingpin Marvel Thompson, a record producer and real estate investor, was among those arrested. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police said they did not know what was in the envelope. The U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office would not comment on the probe, and neither would Chicago Police Supt. Phil Cline. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What I can tell you is it&rsquo;s not unusual for the Police Department to send letters to aldermen regarding complaints that they&rsquo;ve made or information,&rdquo; Cline said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The question of how Troutman ended up in the middle of a federal investigation of the gang was the talk at City Hall on Thursday among the alderman&rsquo;s colleagues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked. So many unanswered questions. I just hope it was a mistake. I hope and pray that everything works out with her,&rdquo; said Ald. Shirley Coleman (16th). 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very committed and concerned about her community. . . . I don&rsquo;t understand how an envelope like that would get to where it&rsquo;s located.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mayor Daley refused to comment on the investigation that now includes one of his aldermanic appointees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this month, the Sun-Times reported that Grand Crossing Police Cmdr. Ernest T. Brown ordered that a squad car park in front of Troutman&rsquo;s home from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays because she was burglarized. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After she was quoted as saying, &ldquo;Deserve it? Damn right,&rdquo; the car was removed from her home in the 6500 block of South Kimbark, although police are still giving her property &ldquo;special attention&rdquo; by checking on it regularly, a police source said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Troutman was a precinct captain with close ties to former State&rsquo;s Attorney Cecil A. Partee when Daley chose her after the 1990 death of Ald. Ernest Jones (20th).
