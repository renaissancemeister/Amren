			<h1>
				If Kids Misbehave, The School System Must Be Racist -- Huh?
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Margaret Wente, Globe and Mail (Toronto), May. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the last academic year, 150 kids were kicked out of Toronto&rsquo;s public schools for weapons possession. Another few thousand were suspended for such offences as fighting, bullying, swearing at a teacher, threatening to beat somebody up, or for &ldquo;conduct injurious to the moral tone of the school or to the physical or mental well-being of others.&rdquo; In all, 5.6 per cent of the student body was suspended, mostly for a day or two. Only 43 were expelled for good. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Everybody in the system knows that a disproportionate number of those kids are of colour. Most of them have serious academic problems, too. Kids who can&rsquo;t read or write tend to behave more badly than kids who can, and vice versa. And kids who fail in school will probably fail in life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The struggle of such kids in Canada&rsquo;s biggest school system -- Somalis and Tamils, as well as kids from the Caribbean &mdash; is a serious problem that deserves serious thought. Toronto&rsquo;s not alone. This is a big issue in the U.S. and Britain, too. But don&rsquo;t expect a serious thought to emerge from the task force inquiring into this problem on behalf of the Toronto District School Board. It knows what caused the problem, and it knows the answers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The cause? Simple. The schools are racist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The answers? First, start keeping racial statistics to find out exactly how racist the schools actually are. Second, repeal the province&rsquo;s Safe Schools Act, which is widely, but wrongly, described as &ldquo;draconian.&rdquo; (For example, the act makes it mandatory to suspend a kid who packs a weapon to class.) Third, teach the teachers to be more culturally sensitive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, if some kids don&rsquo;t meet the standards for decent conduct, lower them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The task force was co-chaired by school trustee Chris Bolton and by Zanana Akande, a well-known figure in Toronto&rsquo;s racism industry. It concluded that the schools are racist because a self-selected group of unhappy students, parents and lobbyists said so. Such argument by anecdote is common these days. It was perfected during the heyday of feminism, when, if somebody felt victimized, marginalized, disenfranchised, or anything other-ized, then that meant they were. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This ball got rolling last winter, when the Ontario Human Rights Commission issued a report on racial profiling in the province and found that the schools are guilty of it. How did it know this? The same way the task force did: because some people said so. The commission wants the schools to &ldquo;accept and acknowledge the existence of the discriminatory effect of &lsquo;zero tolerance&rsquo; legislation and policies, as well as the phenomenon of racial profiling.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The racism industry assumes that there is only one explanation for unequal outcomes, and that is racism. Never mind that minorities now make up significant numbers of teachers, vice-principals and principals. If &ldquo;racialized&rdquo; kids do worse, it must be because they are unfairly treated. And if some groups of kids really do behave more badly than others, it&rsquo;s because the schools have failed to help them feel as if they belong. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neither the human-rights commission nor the task force breathes a word about the obvious connection between bad behaviour and failing grades, bad behaviour and broken families, and bad behaviour and peer attitudes that are overwhelmingly hostile toward school and academic achievement. That would be blaming the victim. Instead, the task force approvingly quotes the view that it&rsquo;s time &ldquo;to launch some kind of class-action suit against the school board and against the province.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				By the way, these bodies say that kids of colour aren&rsquo;t the only victims of discrimination. So are students with disabilities. In case this conjures up a picture of teachers being mean to kids in wheelchairs, I should tell you that &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; (presumably bad behaviour, although the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is left unstated because it would be stigmatizing) is classified as an official form of disability. The vast majority of kids with disabilities who get into trouble are kids with &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; disabilities. The task force also says the schools discriminate against boys, because boys account for three-quarters of the suspensions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps fearing a class-action suit -- and who can blame them? -- the school principals have bravely denied that they are racist. But the racism industry is demanding action. And it&rsquo;s unlikely that constructive engagement with the issue is anywhere on the horizon.
