				&rsquo;Soul Food&rsquo; serves up last episode 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>AP, MSNBC, May 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LOS ANGELES - The fifth and final season of television&rsquo;s longest-running black drama, Showtime&rsquo;s &ldquo;Soul Food,&rdquo; is serving up its last episode, leaving behind an uncertain future for the genre. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on the 1997 hit film of the same name, the multigenerational saga of one Chicago family has been one of Showtime&rsquo;s most popular series, making stars out of Vanessa Williams (not the former Miss America), Nicole Ari Parker and others. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fans held &ldquo;Soul Food&rdquo; viewing parties and the show&rsquo;s official Web site amassed over 10,000 hits daily. But after the finale airs Wednesday at 10 p.m. EDT, there will be no significant black dramas left on the air. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So why is &ldquo;Soul Food&rdquo; ending now? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Showtime decided it was best &ldquo;to go out on top with high ratings and high-quality storytelling,&rdquo; said series executive producer Tracey Edmonds, although increasing production costs might have been a factor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet Edmonds said the story line will be left &ldquo;open-ended enough&rdquo; so that another network could revive the series if it wanted to. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This show speaks to its audience on a personal level, especially in the African-American culture. That&rsquo;s because we have African-Americans writing for these characters, African-Americans directing episodes, reflecting their true lives and lifestyles.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While it never came close to being as big a cable deal as something like &ldquo;The Sopranos,&rdquo; the NAACP Image award-winning series marked a turning point, said Ron Simon, curator for the Museum of Television and Radio in New York. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Soul Food&rsquo; represents the beginning steps of trying to answer the question: How do you deal with the new African-American reality on television?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not dealing with stereotypes and the way (white people) think things are. It just shows the great potential of African-American drama on television.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And for that, said Rochell Thomas, an associate editor at TV Guide, &ldquo;Soul Food&rdquo; deserves more credit from those who&rsquo;ve dismissed it as a mere movie spin-off. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The fact that it worked is what matters,&rdquo; said Thomas, adding, &ldquo;in general, dramas are having a hard time right now if they aren&rsquo;t law or cop shows. It&rsquo;s just that no one is willing to give a black drama a chance.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She and others attribute this to an attitude among TV executives that black dramas don&rsquo;t sell well in national syndication and overseas &mdash; markets where television shows typically make much of their profits. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Showtime President Robert Greenblatt, whose network is developing two new black dramas, said that argument is erroneous &ldquo;until networks and studios have enough shows to really amass some real research on that.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;To not access those characters and that culture in a dramatic form is just stupid,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Shows need crossover appeal</strong> <br>
				Todd Boyd, professor of USC&rsquo;s School of Cinema and Television, questioned whether today&rsquo;s benchmark of black success on television should be drama. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Looking at the broad spectrum of television, there&rsquo;s a different image you get, and in many cases black people have infiltrated spaces that are prominent and visible. It may not be dramas, but there is a certain visibility,&rdquo; Boyd said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the reality of network television is that it is driven more by profits than social consciousness, so unless an &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; show has crossover appeal to a wider audience, it will never achieve true hit status. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Soul Food&rdquo; did well enough for a pay-cable program, but it was never able to attract a significant white audience and therefore would not have been considered successful on a broadcast network. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You have to appeal to blacks and whites in the audience,&rdquo; said historian Tim Brooks, &ldquo;and the black audience isn&rsquo;t big enough if whites won&rsquo;t watch, too. Whites certainly will watch black shows if they don&rsquo;t feel excluded by it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That may be part of it,&rdquo; said director Paris Barclay, who was an executive producer on CBS&rsquo; defunct black serial, &ldquo;City of Angles.&rdquo; &ldquo;But even if you have a show identified as a black show, just from the title, &lsquo;Soul Food,&rsquo; white people don&rsquo;t want to sample it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dee LaDuke, author of &ldquo;Making Great Television,&rdquo; agrees. She noted that white shows have become part of the &ldquo;normal TV viewing experience&rdquo; for black viewers, &ldquo;but white people don&rsquo;t themselves make (black shows) a first choice. Convincing the broadcast networks that these lives are as rich and sexy, tragic and funny as any that have succeeded on television &hellip; is the next step for the reflection of race on television.&rdquo;
