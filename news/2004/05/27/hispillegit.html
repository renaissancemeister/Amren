				<a href="https://www.parapundit.com/archives/002135.html#002135">Illegitimacy Trend Worsened By Hispanic Immigration</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Randall Parker, Parapundit.com, May 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Roger Clegg reports on the worsening news about illegitimacy. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<a href="/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf">According to the latest National Vital Statistics Reports of the federal government</a>, 34 percent of all births in the United States now are to unmarried mothers. Of course, it will surprise no one that nearly all births to girls below 15, and 80 percent of those to girls between 15 and 19, are out-of-wedlock. But even among women between 20 and 24, 52 percent of births are now illegitimate. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Those figures are for all races and ethnicities. As the federal report notes, however, in a decided understatement: &ldquo;Birth rates for unmarried women vary widely by race and Hispanic origin.&rdquo; Among African Americans, 68.2 percent of births are illegitimate, versus 23.0 percent for non-Hispanic whites. For American Indians, 59.7 percent of births are illegitimate; for Asians and Pacific Islanders, 14.9 percent; and for Hispanics of all races, 43.5 percent. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, &ldquo;Asians and Pacific Islanders&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; are artificial categories, and this is reflected in the wide range of illegitimacy rates among their respective subgroups. Thus, only 9.0 and 10.3 percent of Chinese and Japanese births, respectively, are out-of-wedlock, versus 20.0 percent for Filipinos and 50.4 percent for Hawaiians; and the percentage of illegitimate births for Puerto Ricans (59.1) is double that of Cubans (29.8), with Mexicans (42.1) and Central and South Americans (44.8) falling in between. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I will not belabor the obvious point: To indulge in an understatement of my own, those groups with higher illegitimacy rates aren&rsquo;t doing as well as those with lower illegitimacy rates. 
				</p>
			</blockquote>

				Of course Hispanics are America&rsquo;s most rapidly growing ethnic group. While some of the more Panglossian conservatives try to argue that Hispanics have such strong family values that it is inevitable that the Hispanics will become model Republicans some day (and why is it that Democrats have a bigger reputation for hallucinogen drug use?) the raw social science data argues strongly to the contrary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While demograph trends in America are bad news for the Rino (Republican In Name Only) Party <b>what is much worse is that the demographic trends in America are bad news for America.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jack Dunphy (a pseudonym), an LAPD cop, witing about a recent murder of an 11 year old boy who was living with his grandparents on account of his parents being drug addicts, gives the bad news on the trend toward grandparents acting as parents. 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				As we debate whether a child can have two fathers or two mothers, can we at least agree that a child is harmed when he has <i>no</i> mother and <i>no</i> father? A May 1999 Census Bureau report, <a href="/prod/99pubs/p23-198.pdf">Coresident Grandparents and Grandchildren</a>, tells of the sharp rise in the number of children being raised by their grandparents. In 1970 there were 2.2 million children living in homes maintained by grandparents. By 1980 the figure had risen modestly to 2.3 million, or about 3 percent of all children under age 18. In 1997 there were 3.9 million such children, or 5.5 percent of all minors in the country. The report attributes this increase to &ldquo;the growth in drug use among parents, teen pregnancy, divorce, the rapid rise of single-parent households, mental and physical illness, AIDS, crime, child abuse and neglect, and incarceration of parents.&rdquo; Most police officers, especially those working in the grittier areas of large cities, are well aware of the consequences of these numbers. Even the healthiest grandparent is no match for the typical American teenager 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				What Dunphy doesn&rsquo;t bring up is that the next generation is going to be even worse. I know of cases where the grandparents have raised their grandkids where the grandkids then went on to have children they were too irresponsible to raise. Well, this is a stop-gap measure. <b>Once the last responsible generation is dead who is going to raise the later generations of messed up kids?</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Taxpayers are of course going to pay increasing costs for all of this and society will function less well.
