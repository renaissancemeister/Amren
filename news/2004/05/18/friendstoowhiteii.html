				Column Drawing Unfriendly Comments

				<i><a href="mailto:mseate@tribweb.com">Mike Seate</a>, Tribune-Review, May 18, 2004 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				After this week&rsquo;s mail, I tip my cap to anyone clever or intuitive enough to predict the public&rsquo;s passions. That&rsquo;s something most newspaper columnists can&rsquo;t do with any accuracy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Poke fun at serious subjects, from the Iraq war to our city&rsquo;s fear of economic progress, and nobody seems to care. Columns like those generate maybe one e-mail &mdash; no calls, no letters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s enough to give a fella the impression nobody really cares what our troops are up to in their endless foreign adventures or whether our city will survive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now I understand that we&rsquo;re not disinterested or unfeeling. We just need the right subject to help get our anger out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That issue is, apparently, situation comedies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After Thursday&rsquo;s column ridiculing NBC&rsquo;s beloved &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; for taking place in racially diverse New York City, but never casting any minorities, I was bombed with a shock-and-awe load of reader hate mail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By the level of passion they displayed, some &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; fans have elevated Monica, Phoebe, Joey and their pals to religious icons. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;No blacks or Puerto Ricans on &lsquo;Friends&rsquo;?&rdquo; one reader said. &ldquo;Maybe if it was a crime show, minorities would be better represented.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the rest of the 300 &ldquo;must-see TV&rdquo; fans who called did so with requests for my head on a platter at Central Perk, the friends&rsquo; favorite coffee shop. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Here&rsquo;s the weird part: Most of the folks who contacted me were angered not by their favorite show&rsquo;s lack of realism and diversity, but by someone joking about it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall any white people (complaining) about how unrealistic (&rsquo;The Cosby Show&rsquo;) was,&rdquo; one reader said. &ldquo;A black doctor married to a black lawyer with five kids in Ivy League colleges? That&rsquo;s about as realistic as this bridge I&rsquo;d like to sell you.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This reader was far from alone in his angry characterization of comedian and Jell-O spokesman Bill Cosby as &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s leading racist, next to you and that jerk Jesse Jackson.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, I came away with the impression that lots of viewers were captivated by the show because it provided a view of New York that looked more like Salt Lake City. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The fact that there were few blacks on &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; is a good point for me. I&rsquo;m sick of seeing (blacks) everywhere. As for the future, yes it would be brighter if whiter,&rdquo; said one reader, sounding suspiciously like that loudmouthed OxiClean spokesman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We will never accept blacks or enjoy seeing them on TV, so leave &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; alone,&rdquo; another reader said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Honestly, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could get this passionate about more important issues such as wars, famines and social injustice? Maybe we could &mdash; if those events all happened to pretty, thin, white singles. 
			</p>
