				Durban Runs Out Of Space For The Dead
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Wendell Roelf, Sapa, Mail and Guardian (SA), May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The eThekwini municipality is planning a national conference on cemeteries and land to address the shortage of space for burial grounds, the head of cemetery services said on Friday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We called the conference because we discovered that eThekwini [formerly Durban] municipality was not the only council that had to deal with the reality of shortages of space for burials,&rdquo; said Thembinkosi Ngcobo, the municipality head of the parks, recreation, cemeteries and culture department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ngcobo said that in Durban, for example, cemeteries expected to last for 15 years are only lasting about eight years, with available land suitable for burial purposes competing with housing, industrial development and agricultural activities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is estimated that more than 12ha of land will be required in the eThekwini region every year in order to accommodate the definite death increase rate caused by the scourge of HIV/Aids in our society,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ngcobo said his municipality is actively campaigning among especially the African community to adopt cremation as an alternative to burial, but this approach has met with hesitancy on the part of communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said that over the past two years an increase has been noted, with less than 10 cremations two years ago now &ldquo;multiplying&rdquo; to 20 per annum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The possibility of a high-profile person, such as Brenda Fassie, being cremated can help make people aware of cremation,&rdquo; said Ngcobo of the cultural difficulties that need to be overcome. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ngcobo said the municipality is also looking at other alternatives to cremation, such as recycling graves and even freezing and shattering bodies to achieve the same effect as cremation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We will send a team to America in July to learn more about this [freezing],&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ngcobo also spoke out against the unbecoming behaviour at cemeteries caused by unruly youngsters who disregard cemetery by-laws and other grieving mourners. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is a new breed of criminals who do car hijackings, wheel spins, robbing of mourners, discharging of guns, play loud music and burn vehicles. Vandalism and theft of tombstones are part of this new criminal activity and some even use cemeteries for hiding stolen property,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The national cemeteries and crematoria conference is scheduled to take place from July 15 to 16. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Delegates are expected to debate the solutions to the impact of escalating burials, the scourge of HIV/Aids, scarce land and traditional burials, among others. &mdash; Sapa

				<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1216241,00.html">700,000 South African Children Are Infected With HIV</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i> Andrew Meldrum, Guardian (UK), May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				More than 700,000 South African children aged 14 years and younger are HIV-positive, according to figures reported yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A survey by the Human Sciences Research Council found that the Aids epidemic was as widespread among the country&rsquo;s young as in the population at large. An estimated 5.7 million of South Africa&rsquo;s 45 million people are infected with the virus, giving it the largest HIV-positive population in the world. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These are shocking figures that highlight the urgent need to get effective treatment to our young people,&rdquo; said Rukia Cornelius, a spokeswoman for the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). The survey is expected to add to pressure on the president, Thabo Mbeki, to improve efforts to prevent and treat the disease. Mr Mbeki&rsquo;s government has been widely criticised for reacting too slowly to the Aids crisis. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The survey found that 5.4% of two to 14-year-olds were HIV-positive, compared with 5.3% of the total population. Among two to nine-year-olds the infection rate was 6.7%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The younger children are believed to have contracted HIV from their mothers, and the older through sexual abuse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Olive Shisana, the study&rsquo;s chief researcher, told ThisDay newspaper the risk among children had been underestimated. &ldquo;It appears that children run a much greater risk of contracting the disease than previously thought,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The survey also showed that 3.3% of children between two and 18 had lost one or both parents to Aids. The UN estimates the disease has orphaned 660,000 South African children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Black youngsters are the hardest hit, with almost half of those infected living in poverty, according to the report. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The infection rates are higher for children in &ldquo;informal settlements&rdquo;, the term used for squatter camps on the outskirts of major cities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It said many children were living in high-risk environments where they were threatened with sexual abuse at home, in schools and in their neighbourhoods. TAC, an organisation which lobbies for life-saving treatment for people with HIV, said transmission of the virus from mother to child could be drastically reduced with drug therapy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Two years ago we won a court case ordering the government to provide ARVs [anti-retroviral drugs] to pregnant mothers to reduce mother-to-child transmission and yet we still have this terrible rate,&rdquo; Ms Cornelius said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Mbeki&rsquo;s government began providing the drugs through a few state hospitals early this year. The provision of the treatments remains limited, although authorities say it is growing.
