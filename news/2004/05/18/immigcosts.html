			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Federation for American Immigration Reform, May 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				(Washington, DC &mdash; May 17, 2004) According to a new survey by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Mexican and Latin American immigrants living in the U.S. send $30 billion a year in remittances back to their native countries. The loss of $30 billion a year from the U.S. economy represents only a small fraction of the cost of mass immigration to American taxpayers and workers, claims the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to $30 billion a year leaving the country, there are untold billions in lost wages by American workers and many billions more in social costs to provide basic services to the immigrants, their families and the workers they have displaced, contends FAIR. Moreover, while the IDB estimates that immigrants contribute $450 billion a year to the U.S. economy &mdash; less than 5 percent of GDP &mdash; much of that economic output would likely have been produced by American workers had immigrants not flooded the labor market. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The IDB study is valuable because it gives the American public and policymakers an idea of how much money is leaving our economy every year and a state-by-state breakdown of where the money comes from,&rdquo; said Dan Stein, executive director of FAIR. &ldquo;Their analysis &mdash; that this is a phenomenon that is good for both the United States and the sending countries &mdash; is highly flawed.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The IDB assumes that the work being done by immigrants in this country is cheap and that it would not have otherwise been done by American workers, albeit at higher wages,&rdquo; Stein continued. &ldquo;Immigrants do not provide cheap labor; they provide subsidized labor that is costly to everyone except the direct employers.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is also highly questionable whether the $30 billion sent back to Mexico and Latin America offsets the loss of their most productive workers and the lost opportunities for economic and political reform that might have occurred in those countries if the United States did not provide a constant safety valve for millions of dissatisfied workers. Having an entire region dependent on sending their workers out of the country and waiting for them to send home a few dollars every month is bad economic and social policy,&rdquo; Stein said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The IDB study as well as others that have examined the phenomenon of remittances sent home by foreign workers in this country provide no evidence that any significant portion of the billions of dollars that are flowing out of the U.S. are being used to create economic development in the sending countries. &ldquo;It would be one thing if the money being sent abroad was being invested to create economic opportunity in Mexico and Latin America,&rdquo; said Stein. &ldquo;On the contrary, most of it is spent on consumption or to bring additional family members to the U.S., merely perpetuating a culture of emigration and dependency in those countries, while imposing tremendous burdens on American workers and taxpayers.&rdquo;
