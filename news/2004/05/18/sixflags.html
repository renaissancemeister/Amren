				Six Flags Settles Lawsuit

				Fund set up in Magic Mountain bias case 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Amy Raisin Darvish, Los Angeles Daily News, May 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				VALENCIA &mdash; Theme-park giant Six Flags Inc. has set up a $5.6 million fund to settle a discrimination lawsuit at Magic Mountain, where thousands said they were victims of racial profiling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While the Oklahoma City-based company did not admit any wrongdoing, it also agreed to pay an additional $3 million to overhaul security at the Valencia park, and it has abolished all appearance-based screening of park visitors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The class-action case grew from a 2001 lawsuit filed on behalf of park visitors who said they were detained and improperly searched based on their race and appearance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mike Arias, a Los Angeles attorney representing many of the plaintiffs, said the settlement represents more than just a financial victory. &ldquo;The most important part of this settlement is (Magic Mountain&rsquo;s) change in procedures,&rdquo; Arias said. &ldquo;They are doing away with what I would call screening based on appearance. I think Magic Mountain realized things were a little out of control.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the plaintiffs said they were pulled from ticket lines, questioned and denied entry to the park for reasons including race, choice of clothing and visible tattoos. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Officials at Magic Mountain said the company did not engage in any wrongdoing and chose to settle the case &ldquo;to prevent it from becoming too time-consuming and distracting from the everyday operations of the park.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sue Carpenter, public relations manager at Magic Mountain, said the park previously employed screening procedures that, while legal, have been abandoned. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the past we used a variety of methods &mdash; lawful, appropriate ways &mdash; to ensure a safe and secure environment,&rdquo; Carpenter said. &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t used those screening methods in over eight months. We now have everyone pass through metal detectors and we check every bag.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Previous screening methods included questioning visitors who security officers recognized as possibly affiliated with gangs. &ldquo;If security noticed specific tattoos affiliated with known gangs, they would question them,&rdquo; Carpenter said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arias said the list of people claiming discrimination continues to grow and said there could be as many as 6,000 plaintiffs. Distribution of the $5.6 million will likely begin after October. Individual payouts will be determined by the number of substantiated claims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly six months before the settlement, Six Flags Inc. used some of the $3 million it will pay for improved security to establish a sheriff&rsquo;s substation on park grounds. One sergeant and four deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department began full-time assignment in December at Magic Mountain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Six Flags Inc. paid a one-time start-up fee of $183,000 and will foot the nearly $580,000 annual bill for the five-person team to operate at the park. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice presence,&rdquo; Carpenter said of the sheriff&rsquo;s team. &ldquo;We still have our park security, but for matters like shoplifting or line cutting (for rides), we now have a peace officer to handle that.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Six Flags also agreed to furnish 7,000 one-day park passes to people who, while not personally denied entry to the park, accompanied a person who was questioned and turned away. A court hearing on the settlement agreement is scheduled for Aug. 5 in Los Angeles.
