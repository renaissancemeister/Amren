				<i>Raqiyah Mays, AP, May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				NEW YORK (AP) &mdash; P. Diddy has disbanded Da Band. On the Thursday night season finale of MTV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making the Band 2,&rdquo; Diddy &mdash; a.k.a. rapper/entrepreneur/Broadway star Sean Combs &mdash; finally had enough of his rap group&rsquo;s constant drama. So he decided to dismantle the crew rather than release a follow-up album to their 800,000-copy-selling debut, &ldquo;Too Hot For TV.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Initially my goal with Da Band was to make sure the world saw realistically how serious hip-hop was,&rdquo; Diddy told The Associated Press on Thursday. &ldquo;So at times it was kind of embarrassing to me the way they were portraying themselves, not taking it as serious as most artists take this art form. The venture with Da Band was successful because it had the TV backing. But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s not worth me getting money for something I think misrepresents what (my record label) Bad Boy and hip-hop is about.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				By misrepresenting, Diddy meant all the screaming arguments, scuffles, missed appointments, legal entanglements and frequent hardheadedness that the six-member group displayed during two seasons on the hit MTV reality show. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, Dylan got booted from the penthouse, Fred quit and Sara and Chopper were set loose. The only two members Diddy decided to keep were Ness and Babs, who will record solo albums for Bad Boy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, if they don&rsquo;t appreciate it, then somebody else will. That&rsquo;s the nature of the game,&rdquo; Diddy said. &ldquo;Da Band wasn&rsquo;t as hungry and passionate as most of us artists. I don&rsquo;t think their careers are over. I just don&rsquo;t think they have what it takes to be a group.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Diddy has an MTV production deal, which could possibly result in another &ldquo;Making The Band&rdquo; with a whole new set of would-be superstars. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The moral of the story is you have to take advantage of your opportunities and you have to give love to your craft,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, you can achieve a dream, but it can also be dissolved.&rdquo;
