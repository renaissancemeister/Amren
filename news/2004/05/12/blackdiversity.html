			<h1>
				More &ldquo;Diversity&rdquo; = Black
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Discriminations, May 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Berkeley undergraduate Renita Haney is &ldquo;young, smart and black,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/05/10/BAG546INNI1.DTL">reports</a> the San Francisco Chronicle. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She&rsquo;s angry because of the decline in &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<div align="left">
				<blockquote>
					&ldquo;Where is the diversity promised to my community by UC Berkeley when we decided to come here?&rdquo; she demanded at an April 22 rally in front of the chancellor&rsquo;s office after the latest fall admission figures were released. 
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<p>
				Note well how the Chronicle describes this decline: 
			</p>
			<div align="left">
				<blockquote>
					&hellip; the campus that has long prided itself on diversity &mdash; only 31 percent of undergraduates were white at the beginning of this school year &mdash; has become increasingly less diverse for certain minority groups, particularly for Chaney and her African American peers. 
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<p>
				A couple of things virtually leap out of this paragraph. One of them was put so well in an email to me by regular reader Michelle Dulak, who called the article to my attention, that I will let her say it: 
			</p>
			<div align="left">
				<blockquote>
					How can declining numbers of African-American students make the campus &ldquo;less diverse&rdquo; for African-American students who do attend? If anything, aren&rsquo;t they encountering yet more students unlike themselves? And why is the number of white students an index of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;? 
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<p>
				Indeed. But insofar as &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is intended to increase the presence of underrepresented minorities, it should be noted that whites are seriously underrepresented. In 2000, they made up<a href="https://www.lao.ca.gov/2000/calfacts/2000_calfacts_demographics.html"> 50% of California&rsquo;s population.</a> 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no doubt that the &ldquo;decline in &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;&ldquo; at Berkeley is producing anger among the diverse, but it has always seemed to me that their preferred solution, racial preferences, predictably produces more of what angers them. Consider, for example: 
			</p>
			<div align="left">
				<blockquote>
					Student Aquelia Lewis told the UC regents in March: &ldquo;Ever since I stepped onto this campus, I&rsquo;ve had to fight racism, negativity and questions about why I should be here.&rdquo; 
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<p>
				But why does she believe, I wonder, that lowering admissions requirements for blacks, i.e., re-instituting racial preferences, would reduce rather than increase &ldquo;questions about why [she] should be here&rdquo;? 
			</p>
