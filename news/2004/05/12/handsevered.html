				<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15853-2004May10.html">Teen&rsquo;s Hands Severed In N.Va. Machete Attack</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Maria Glod and Tom Jackman, Wash. Post, May 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 16-year-old Alexandria area boy&rsquo;s hands were severed with a machete early yesterday when he was attacked by several people believed to be members of a rival gang, Fairfax County police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The teenager was walking alone along Edsall Road in the Alexandria area of Fairfax about 1 a.m. when he was attacked, said Officer Bud Walker, a police spokesman. Physicians at Inova Fairfax Hospital worked for hours and were able to reattach both hands, but the victim lost four fingers, Walker said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty vicious attack,&rdquo; Walker said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He would not say what sparked the assault, saying only that the victim and assailants were members of rival gangs. Law enforcement sources said the victim is a suspected member of the South Side Locos gang, and his attackers are reputed members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang, also known as MS-13. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The incident is the latest sign of the increasing gang activity that has plagued the Washington region. In recent years, Mara Salvatrucha, considered by police to be among the most dangerous gangs in the area, has been linked to at least five killings in Northern Virginia, as well as shootings, other machete attacks, baseball-bat beatings and stabbings.
