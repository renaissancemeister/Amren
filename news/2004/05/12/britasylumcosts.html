				Asylum Is 1.8bn Pound Business
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Michael Lea, Daily Sun, May 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				AN entire industry has grown up to exploit Britain&rsquo;s asylum gravy train, a major Sun investigation reveals today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lawyers, landlords, hoteliers and security firms have all grown rich from the crisis now costing <strong>5MILLION POUNDS A DAY</strong>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last night, Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: &ldquo;This is a Government scandal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There should be no such thing as an asylum industry because cases should be dealt with more quickly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Genuine refugees could be processed and allowed to enter the job market &mdash; bogus claimants sent home. Unscrupulous lawyers and landlords are jumping on the band wagon to fleece the taxpayer.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Latest figures from the Home Office show that 103,080 asylum seekers arrived in Britain in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, the Government is now spending <strong>1.8 BILLION</strong> <b>POUNDS</b> a year on asylum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A breakdown of the figures reveal how millions are going straight into the pockets of lawyers and businessmen. Between April 2003 and this March, 1 in every 10 pounds spent in legal aid went to asylum and immigration lawyers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In total they claimed a whopping 204 million pounds from the public purse &mdash; more than eight times higher than when Labour came to power in 1997. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And yesterday, it emerged that 97 rogue asylum lawyers pocketed 30million pounds by taking on cases doomed to fail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among them was Abbot Ozuzu who was reported by a High Court judge because his work was &ldquo;not competent&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Others cashing in include Muslim fanatic Abu Hamza&rsquo;s lawyer Muddassar Arani. She has not received funding for hook-handed Hamza&rsquo;s deportation challenge but has for other immigration cases. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Various British legal firms now specialise in human rights cases, among them Cherie Blair&rsquo;s chambers, Matrix. Last year, it raked in more than 1.5million pounds in legal aid payments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Millions more of our cash has gone on housing refugees. By December 2003, the Government&rsquo;s National Asylum Support Service was putting up 49,760 refugees. It provided subsistence for a further 30,360. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Home Office refused to reveal the cost, claiming it was &ldquo;commercially sensitive&rdquo; information. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But councils pay landlords and hotel owners up to 350 a week per room, regardless of its condition, as long as it houses an asylum seeker. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One businessman is raking in more than 2 million pounds a year of taxpayers&rsquo; money by providing basic rooms for immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cyprus-born Savas Stavrou has built up an empire of more than 20 guesthouses and hotels and his company&rsquo;s profits have jumped from 134,000 pounds four years ago to 2,354,000 pounds last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some hotel owners in Dover &mdash; the first port of call for many asylum seekers &mdash; are pulling in up to 250,000 pounds annually by taking in only refugees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Adeline Reidy, treasurer of the Dover Hotels And Guest House Group, said: &ldquo;Some have decided concentrating on asylum seekers guarantees a very nice cheque.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, The Sun revealed how the once splendid Nayland Rock Hotel in Margate, Kent, had been taken over by asylum seekers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the 77-bedroom hotel, owned by businessman Panayiotis Stavrou, is crammed with refugees &mdash; at a cost to the taxpayer of 1.5 million pounds a year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2003, the Government removed 17,040 asylum seekers from Britain and enjoying the windfall from immigrant repatriation are firms like Securicor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chief executive Nick Buckles said yesterday it was proving a lucrative new market &mdash; but would not give financial details. There is also a lucrative contract for Group 4 to guard the Oakington asylum reception centre in Cambridgeshire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Public sector jobs to provide assistance to asylum seekers have also rocketed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bilingual outreach workers and development co-ordinators are now highly sought after employees. Government-funded helplines and legal centres are also busy recruiting staff. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Altogether there are an incredible 180 for-profit asylum organisations in Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Department of Constitutional Affairs has pledged to get tough on the spiralling legal aid bill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokesman said: &ldquo;We have already made it clear we are going to take action because of grave concerns. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Measures introduced include an accreditation system, a five-hour limit to free advice and legal aid for appeal cases only with further approval.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And Crispin Passmore, of the Legal Services Commission, which oversees legal aid, said: &ldquo;We are committed to only funding high-quality advice and representation.&rdquo;
