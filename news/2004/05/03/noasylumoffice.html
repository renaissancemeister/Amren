				<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1203984,00.html">They Blame The Buses. I Blame The Bigots</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>David Aaronovitch, The Guardian, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Near Bristol, in the town of Portishead, north Somerset, there is a housing estate called the Vale. As described in the Observer last Sunday, the Vale is a swish new collection of houses with a small business park next to it. On the business park is a small office block with two offices, comprising 120 square metres of space. And those 120 square metres is where the asylum seekers were going to go. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not to live, or to stay, but to have applications for ID cards processed. The Home Office, which applied to the local district council for a change of use, reckoned that around 50 asylum seekers a week would use the office, travelling there from various places in the south-west. So that would be an average of 10 persons a day, or 1.2 per working hour. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But last week the district council rejected the proposals, on the casting vote of the committee chair. The chairman, Labour councillor Glyn Duck (an appropriate name, as we shall see) said that he just didn&rsquo;t think the Bristol bus service was up to the job. &ldquo;Transport hadn&rsquo;t been considered,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Neither had the welfare of the asylum seekers. If they could have been collected from Bristol and returned after their interviews it would have been different.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Duck&rsquo;s vote will, naturally, have been unaffected by the meeting, earlier in the week, of 300 Vale residents. Billed on one poster as a &ldquo;No to asylum seeker meeting&rdquo;, the gathering &mdash; at Portishead&rsquo;s secondary school &mdash; is reported to have jeered supporters of the Home Office application and to have applauded opponents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The arguments of the objectors, as represented in various media by local councillor Dave Pasley, have been quite inventive. The screening centre was &ldquo;wholly inappropriate in this location&rdquo;. He added: &ldquo;The main issues are parking and transport. Parking on the roads and in front of people&rsquo;s houses is completely unacceptable and that is what will happen.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And then there are the possible protests. &ldquo;[Many illegal immigrants] bring supporters to help lobby their cases &mdash; the residents shouldn&rsquo;t have to put up with people shouting and chanting every day.&rdquo; And finally there&rsquo;s all the intolerable strolling around. &ldquo;I realise,&rdquo; said Pasley, &ldquo;that the subject of asylum is emotive and I personally abhor bigotry. But if visitors to this centre are allowed to walk through the estate, that is just not on.&rdquo; Presumably other sorts of visitors, more sensitive to local concerns, teleport themselves. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Other Valites had other concerns, as reported in the local newspaper The Mercury in articles with headlines such as &ldquo;Keep the asylum seekers out of here&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Said one anonymous woman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not against them coming here as such. But they should not be permitted to wander around the country without some kind of regulation. We don&rsquo;t even know if they are genuine asylum seekers. A dad who declared himself &ldquo;neither bigoted nor racist but concerned&rdquo;, was worried whether his children could play outside any more. Campaigner Brian Chichester, of Conference Avenue, gave more practical reasons. &ldquo;A development of this scale will mean there is an increase in traffic, the fact that it is a 24-hour operation means there will be light pollution all night, the windows overlook nearby bedrooms, and the car park will be overflowing with vehicles.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Actually it isn&rsquo;t a 24-hour operation. So &ldquo;Tim&rdquo; of the Portishead Campaign website (slogan: &ldquo;protecting the interests of the residents of Portishead&rdquo;), writes of his fears that &ldquo;for an asylum seeker to travel to Portishead would be a long and difficult journey,&rdquo; which is very altruistic because the estate is home to many commuters who make the same long and difficult journey every day.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Lindy Cox of Peartree Field is frightened of falling property prices, because &ldquo;even if the residents themselves don&rsquo;t have a problem with such a development, potential buyers may have.&rdquo; I know, Lindy, people can be so prejudiced. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The chair of the meeting was the retired Bishop of Barking, Roger Sainsbury. He agreed to preside because, he said, he first became aware of the plans when &ldquo;an elderly resident expressed concern about strained community relations&rdquo;. The bishop was &ldquo;concerned about asylum seekers being demonised&rdquo;, but also concerned for good community relations in Portishead. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this to become like a town in the north-west.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Call this the Portishead mystery. Ten people a day will travel by bus or car to appointments at a business park, and this is a threat to community relations because the buses are too infrequent, the lights from the building are too bright, asylum seekers might catch a glimpse of someone in a bedroom, there isn&rsquo;t enough parking, or they may occasionally walk though the estate bringing down house prices, or ferry in their &ldquo;supporters&rdquo; for a pointless demonstration, thus recreating the tensions of Burnley or Oldham. Isn&rsquo;t that the most pathetic thing you have ever heard? 
			</p>
			<p>
				I should stress that there are several residents and local councillors who have retained their sanity and who do not agree with the protests. Meanwhile, however, the unabashed racists on the Stormfront White Community website have been watching Portishead with interest, and understand exactly what&rsquo;s going on. One contributor calling himself Odin&rsquo;s-Eye quotes mockingly. &ldquo;&rsquo;People have every sympathy with asylum seekers, but it is just inappropriate in this spot? Give me a quid for every time I&rsquo;ve heard that, I may retire.&rdquo; WhiteToVote, however, is focused on the future. &ldquo;Sounds like some real trouble brewing here with some good political opportunities &hellip;&rdquo;
