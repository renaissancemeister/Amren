			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Philip Johnston, Telegraph (UK), Apr. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Britain had record immigration in 2002, when more than 500,000 people arrived in the country to settle or work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One fifth of the new arrivals were from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East, according to figures released yesterday by the Office for National Statistics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Net immigration &mdash; the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving &mdash; stood at 153,000, lower than the previous two years because of a record number of departures. About 360,000 people left the UK during the year. More than 80 per cent of the country&rsquo;s population growth in 2002 was attributable to immigration whereas, at the beginning of the 1990s, there were fewer people arriving than leaving. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of people coming to Britain in 2002 for a year or more was 513,000 &mdash; almost double the number 10 years earlier. There was a net loss of 91,000 British citizens, compared with 53,000 the previous year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the decade, the net gain of non-British citizens has increased dramatically &mdash; from under 100,000 in 1993 to 245,000 in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Just under a third of non-British immigrants in 2002 were from the EU and Old Commonwealth countries while two thirds were from the New Commonwealth and other foreign countries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The latest figures were published at the end of a week in which Tony Blair identified immigration as one of the most potent political issues facing his Government. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Blair said that public worries about immigration were at the highest level since the 1970s. Such concerns were real and should not be dismissed as &ldquo;figments of racist imagination&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the country had reached &ldquo;a crunch point&rdquo; on immigration ahead of the accession of 10 new EU countries tomorrow but the latest figures suggest that the surge in immigration has little to do with the EU. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Only 17 per cent of immigrants were from the EU, a figure that has changed little over the decade. While 125,000 people left the UK to go elsewhere in Europe, 89,000 came in. The number coming from the rest of Europe, including the accession countries was 46,000, fewer than in 2000 but double the number in 1993. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly half of immigrants said London and the South East was their intended destination. This was balanced by an almost equal number of people leaving the region to work abroad. Of those who migrated to the UK in 2002, 52 per cent were employed before they left their country of origin and nearly two thirds of these were professionals or managers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The most mobile group was aged 15 to 24, who accounted for one third of the immigrants and most commonly said they were coming to study. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Following Mr Blair&rsquo;s promise of a &ldquo;top to bottom&rdquo; review of immigration policy, the Conservatives yesterday set up their own commission to look at the system, to be chaired by Timothy Kirkhope, an MEP and former immigration minister. He said: &ldquo;The benefits of immigration to the UK are often obscured by people&rsquo;s genuine unease over the Government&rsquo;s lack of control over the immigration system.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since 1993, total net immigration is about a million, with an average rise of 125,000 for each of the past five years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ministers say more migrant workers are needed as the indigenous population is not growing fast enough and is ageing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When he was asked last year, David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, said there was &ldquo;no obvious limit&rdquo; to the number of foreigners who could settle in Britain. 
			</p>
