				Lunchroom Integration Lesson Leads TV Documentaries
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Walt Belcher, tbo.com (FL), May 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>TAMPA &mdash; </b>At a racially diverse high school in Buffalo, N.Y., a dozen students take on a simple yet revealing challenge: They want students to sit with classmates of different races during lunch. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their efforts, documented on film, spark a debate on social segregation as well as an examination of their own prejudices and perceptions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The school&rsquo;s self-segregated lunchroom becomes a metaphor for America&rsquo;s race relations on &ldquo;I Sit Where I Want: The Legacy of Brown v. Board of Education.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Airing next Monday on The N, a cable network for teens (channel 125 on Bright House Networks in Hillsborough County), &ldquo;I Sit Where I Want&rdquo; is the most intriguing of three new documentaries coming to television as the country looks back on the 50th anniversary of the landmark decision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Programs on PBS and CNN also look at how far we&rsquo;ve come in race relations since the 1954 case named for Linda 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brown, a black third-grader in Topeka, Kan., who wanted to attend an all-white elementary school in her neighborhood. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Supreme Court ruled in favor of her and four others attached to the case, striking down a previous ruling that allowed segregation if blacks were provided &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; education. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The court said schools that were segregated were inherently unequal. But it would take more than two decades for some schools to integrate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Students Self-Segregate At Lunch</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I Sit Where I Want&rdquo; takes viewers inside the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts, where students live socially separate lives, self &mdash; segregating themselves outside of the classrooms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When filmmakers Whitney Dow and Marco Williams challenged them to examine race relations, students in a small group, concerned about improving relations, decide they will take on the lunchroom project. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a recent interview, Dow said the lunchroom at almost any high school in America offers a graphic representation of the country&rsquo;s social segregation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Williams says what surprised him was that the students thought everything was fine until they started taking a hard look at how segregated their lives were. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Once they started the project, we found that there was a real hunger among the teens to talk about it and think about it,&rdquo; Dow says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A senior named Chadet says that although she is &ldquo;friends with everybody,&rdquo; she has noticed &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s really weird, like we were going on a field trip, and there was two buses, and all the white people went to one bus and all the black people went to another bus.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how it is,&rdquo; she says at the outset. &ldquo;Black people have closer friends who are black, and white people have closer friends who are white.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another student, Corey, says, &ldquo;We do sit at different tables at lunch. They definitely talk about us. We talk about them. It&rsquo;s segregated, but it&rsquo;s just by instinct. We just do it. No matter what, everybody&rsquo;s different. People want to say we&rsquo;re all equal, but we&rsquo;re not. We&rsquo;ve got to accept that we&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Change Hard To Swallow</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as the group begins to visit one another&rsquo;s homes and make an effort to crack social and cultural barriers, they discover similarities and differences that bring some of them together. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The group also finds that though their fellow students say they are open to desegregating the cafeteria, no one will change seats. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At one point, the group frantically uses a microphone to urge mass seat changing. The effort fails. Only when they urge individual students and invite them, one-on-one, to change tables do things start to happen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For a while, it appears progress is being made and the races are getting to know each other. But two months later, the cafeteria seating divides along racial lines again. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the students who lead the effort find they have changed and new interracial friendships are forged. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This maybe the best lesson of the show, Williams says. Friendships can cross racial differences if given a chance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Test Scores, Brown History Probed</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The CNN documentary on Sunday looks at the education system in a different way. On &ldquo;The Gap: 50 Years After the Brown Ruling,&rdquo; CNN correspondent Dan Lothian goes inside the Shaker Heights, Ohio, school system to examine why black high school seniors consistently have lower test scores than white students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Integrated for nearly 30 years, Shaker Heights is considered a strong public school system, but the gap in educational achievement is present. Teachers, parents and students debate the reasons why. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reasons range from the economic and social inequities that remain in society to anti &mdash; intellectualism within black popular culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Beyond Brown: Pursuing the Promise&rdquo; on PBS (WEDU, Channel 3) on Wednesday offers a good history of the genesis of the historic lawsuit, composed of five cases that worked their way to the high court in the early 1950s. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Through archival film, photos and current interviews with participants, the film recalls the events that launched one of the cases, in Prince Edward County, Va., that shut down the entire Prince Edward public school system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The documentary also looks at ongoing challenges and current inequities in public schools, such as &ldquo;ability tracking&rdquo; in Los Angeles, student testing in Orlando, busing in Boston and school funding in New York City.
