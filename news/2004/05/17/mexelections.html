				Absentee voting by emigres is long-delayed, sparking steps such as cross-border candidates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Jennifer Mena, L. A. Times, May 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1996, Mexico granted its citizens who live in the United States the right to cast absentee ballots, instantly creating a bloc of nearly 11 million potential voters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eight years later, many of those voters, frustrated that a balloting mechanism hasn&rsquo;t been created, are restless and rallying for action. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mexican politicians who reluctantly adopted the voting change have delayed its implementation because &ldquo;they fear us,&rdquo; said Santa Ana tax preparer and immigrant activist Guadalupe Gomez. &ldquo;They fear our economic power and they fear our political power.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Across the U.S., Mexicans are lobbying their homeland politicians to implement the legislation. Their voices are not easily ignored. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2003, as President Vicente Fox points out, Mexicans in the United States sent $12 billion to their families back home &mdash; more foreign income than from tourism, foreign investment or exported oil &mdash; and, as voters, they would represent 15% of the Mexican electorate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government wants the absentee-voting system created by July 5, 2005, so Mexicans living in the United States can vote in their 2006 national elections &mdash; a decade after the right was extended to them. 
			</p>
