				<i>Carrie Schumaker, AP, Newsday.com, May 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; A former top executive of the United Way of the National Capital Area was sentenced Friday to 27 months in prison for stealing from the charity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Oral O. Suer, 69, pleaded guilty in March to improperly receiving nearly $500,000 from the charity and its pension fund. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You may have accomplished a great deal with the United Way, but at the same time you were involved in theft, there&rsquo;s no other way to put it,&rdquo; said U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee in the Arlington, Va., courtroom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lee also ruled that Suer must pay $497,000 restitution to the United Way pension fund. Attorneys for Suer said he had already paid about $94,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is a very sad day for me, the community and the United Way,&rdquo; Suer told the court. &ldquo;I feel embarrassment, shame and guilt.&rdquo; Suer&rsquo;s wife wept quietly as he read the statement. His son and daughter were also present. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Suer, a Turkish national, is not a U.S. citizen and could face deportation proceedings once his prison term has been satisfied. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite changes in leadership, the controversy over Suer&rsquo;s case has hurt the capital-area United Way. After collecting $45 million in pledges in 2001, the charity is headed for a third straight year of raising less than half that amount. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Suer will serve his time at a minimum security facility in Petersburg, Va.
