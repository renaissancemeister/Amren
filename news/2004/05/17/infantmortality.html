				The Fight To Save Black Babies
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Doctors struggle against stubborn high mortality rate 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>AP, Chic. Tribune, May 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				When Nakida Maxson was pregnant, some of her friends teased her about going to birthing classes and taking prenatal vitamins, saying they were things only white people did. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a white-people thing, it&rsquo;s a child thing,&rdquo; said Maxson of Chicago. &ldquo;For your child, you need to make sure that certain things are taken care of.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She is determined to not become part of a troubling statistical trend in Illinois: The rate of black babies who died before their first birthday increased in 2002 to 15.7 per 1,000 live births, even as the overall infant-mortality rate fell to an all-time low of 7.2 deaths. The rate for whites was 5.5. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nationally and in Illinois, the infant-mortality rate for blacks and whites has declined significantly in the last two decades, but black babies are still twice as likely to die as white babies. And the disparity is growing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cultural viewpoints 
			</p>
			<p>
				Health experts say cultural viewpoints about pregnancy and child rearing are among the factors responsible for the disparity, along with access to health care, income and perhaps even racism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Reaching at-risk women is one of the keys to reducing the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Illinois Department of Public Health oversees programs that help more than 100,000 low-income women each year with counseling, food vouchers, prenatal care at hospital clinics and other services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state plans a new campaign this summer, with the help of federal dollars, to reduce sudden infant death syndrome among blacks and provide more care to women who previously had premature births. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Doctors say more than half of all infants who die each year are born early and have a low birth weight. On average, black women have a higher risk of delivering prematurely and to have babies with low birth weights. Black infants also face a much higher risk of SIDS. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We do know what helps is to make sure that all high-risk women are located and that we get them hooked up with a doctor, make sure they get good prenatal care and that any medical conditions may be identified,&rdquo; said Dr. Stephen Saunders, associate director of family health for the state Department of Human Services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But some women may not be aware of government services or have problems getting transportation or time off from work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine hospital in Springfield, some low-income mothers from central and southern Illinois don&rsquo;t go to regular checkups because they have to travel up to 40 miles to get to that hospital since doctors in their area don&rsquo;t accept Medicaid, said Dr. Victoria Nichols-Johnson, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at SIU. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Dick David, a neonatologist at the Stroger Hospital, said the government must do more to increase outreach in the black community and to improve women&rsquo;s access to health care before and after their children are born. Generally, low-income women are covered under Medicaid only during their pregnancy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The strategy for improving infant mortality in the United States is one that makes perfect sense for people who are already well-nourished, are already getting basic care, have a good place to live, et cetera,&rdquo; David said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Maxson, 27, had several things going for her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A stint in the Navy helped convince her of the importance of health care and gave her a way to pay for it. During an early prenatal visit, doctors found the fluid in her womb was low. She was hospitalized for nearly three weeks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her daughter was born more than a month early, but otherwise fine. Now they are home, and Maxson is breast-feeding her baby, which the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends for a child&rsquo;s first year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Breast-feeding urged 
			</p>
			<p>
				Doctors cite evidence that breast milk is nutritionally superior and reduces the incidence of infection, but they note that black women are less likely to breast-feed their children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Maxson said there is a need for the kind of outreach that ultimately accompanied the 1990s campaign to persuade parents to put infants to sleep on their backs to reduce SIDS. At first the campaign failed to reach the black community, but once it did, the number of SIDS deaths among blacks dropped. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are other issues, still unproven or unexplained, that may play a role in the higher death rate for black babies. Even when income and education are comparable, infant mortality is still higher among blacks than whites. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some researchers have pointed to factors such as living in high-crime areas and racial discrimination.
