			</h1>

				<i>Adam Lisberg, N. Y. Daily News, May 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Comedian Whoopi Goldberg&rsquo;s city-centered sitcom has been scrapped from the NBC lineup after a season of low ratings and critical pans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Whoopi&rsquo; has been canceled,&rdquo; co-star Wren Brown sadly told the Daily News yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An NBC spokeswoman said the network would unveil its fall lineup today, but said no decision has been made about the show&rsquo;s fate. Executives at rival networks who have seen drafts of the schedule say &ldquo;Whoopi&rdquo; is not on it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Goldberg, whose spokesman did not return a message, had high hopes for a comedy set in New York City starring a multicultural cast &mdash; unlike &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seinfeld.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She wanted the show to mix topical jokes with social commentary. Critics said the idea was great but the show was not funny. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Viewers fled quickly: More than 15 million people watched the first episode in September. Last month&rsquo;s finale drew 5 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The show starred Goldberg as a flash-in-the-pan 1980s singer turned wisecracking owner of a small Manhattan hotel. Brown played her conservative brother, with a white girlfriend who acted black, and the hotel&rsquo;s handyman was Iranian. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brown said the cast got the word by phone Friday evening. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Whoopi saw to it that our show represented a diversity &mdash; and a New York diversity &mdash; that was really honest,&rdquo; Brown said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Goldberg, a native New Yorker, insisted the show be taped here. Mayor Bloomberg visited the set at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Long Island City in August, where he said it would mean 250 jobs and $13 million for New York.
