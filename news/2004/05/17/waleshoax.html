			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				The jury was told the store&rsquo;s windows were sealed up 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Jan. 6, 2003</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A court has heard an Asian couple deliberately set fire to their shop and framed it to look like a racist attack. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Darshan Chand and his wife Malkit are accused of starting the fire just over a year ago at their store in Burry Port near Llanelli, south Wales. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police found slogans daubed onto the back of the store. A swastika had been painted nearby. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Chands deny arson with intent to endanger life. Mrs Chand also denies attempting to obtain an insurance payout by deception. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The jury as Swansea Crown Court heard Mrs Chand tried to persuade detectives that she and her husband, both aged 35, had been victims of racists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prosecutor Geraint Walters said the couple used their car to remove goods from the store &mdash; and had been seen carrying black bin bags out of the premises &mdash; before starting the blaze. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said flames were seen pouring out of the store in Colby Road within 15 minutes of Mrs Chand locking up on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, 2001. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Firefighters noted that both the front and back doors of the property were still locked and intact, and that no entrance had been available for anyone to gain entry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The court was told the couple had taken on the shop, Hill Top stores, more than two years previously. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The trial continues.
