				A farming town is divided over the new Latino majority on its school board. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Jean-Paul Renaud, L. A. Times, May 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				FARMERSVILLE, Calif. &mdash; This is a school district in upheaval: The superintendent has been fired. The interim superintendent was asked not to return next fall. Its schools rank among the lowest in the state. One board member never went to school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, all five board members are facing recall attempts amid allegations of racism, incompetence and vendettas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All this in a town of just two square miles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though Farmersville has seen its share of divisive politics in the past, residents say nothing compares to this. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is the dirtiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen it,&rdquo; said City Councilman Derek Ferguson. &ldquo;This has had a terrible effect on the town. Everything positive that has been achieved in this town has been negated.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The dispute focuses on a new Latino school board majority, elected on a platform that they are the best representation of the district&rsquo;s ethnic makeup. They say that low-income students are being ignored and that little is being done to boost test scores. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Opponents say, however, that those school board members are using their positions to place more Latinos in powerful jobs while removing other longtime district employees.
