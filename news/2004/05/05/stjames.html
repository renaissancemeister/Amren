			<h1>
				Spanish Moor-Killing Saint Is Given The Chop
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>The Times, London, May 3</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Santiago cathedral is to lose its politically incorrect sculpture 
			</p>
			<p>
				A STATUE of Spain&rsquo;s patron saint, Saint James &ldquo;the Moorslayer&rdquo;, is to be removed from one of the country&rsquo;s most famous cathedrals and pilgrimage centres in case it offends Muslims. The decision, announced by Santiago Cathedral&rsquo;s church authorities, has outraged traditional Catholics, many of whom still light candles and pray to the 18th-century statue in the tiny chapel inside one of Christendom&rsquo;s three greatest pilgrim places of worship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the cathedral&rsquo;s spokesman insisted the decision was taken four months ago to remove the Moorslayer sculpture &mdash; which depicts the sword-wielding apostle of Jesus astride a white charger, trampling the beheaded corpses of Saracens &mdash; Spain&rsquo;s national press said the announcement had more to do with the March 11 massacre of 190 people by Islamic terrorists in Madrid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				El Mundo said that the echoes from mainland Europe&rsquo;s worst terrorist atrocity had accelerated the withdrawal of the famous symbol and its translation to a museum. St James, according to custom, guided the Christians to reconquer Muslim Spain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;According to our sources, the authorities fear that the expressive image could attract the anger of the Arab world in a period of high tension,&rdquo; the newspaper said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The cathedral&rsquo;s spokesman said the basilica received visits from people of distinct and various traditions and therefore needed to avoid a situation in which &ldquo;persons of other cultures felt offended&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The cathedral intends to replace the politically incorrect sculpture with another one also made in the 18th century by the same artist, Jos&eacute; Gambino. However, it will depict the more peaceful tradition of the apostle, Saint James the Pilgrim. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The pilgrim apostle is a universal image, whereas the other sculpture was related to a historic epoch and very particular circumstances,&rdquo; said cathedral sources. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless the mythical role of Saint James the Moorslayer still exerts a powerful attraction to Spaniards. Troops being withdrawn from Iraq as a result of the Socialist general-election victory three days after Madrid&rsquo;s terrorist massacre, wear the Moorslayer&rsquo;s red cross on their uniforms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Legend has it that St James, son of Zebedee and Salom&eacute; and St John&rsquo;s brother, had preached Christianity in Spain before returning to Judea where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa in AD44. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His body miraculously floated in its stone sarcophagus across the Mediterranean and around the Iberian peninsula. It landed at Iria Flavia, a short distance from Galicia&rsquo;s capital, which was later named Santiago de Compostela after him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His body&rsquo;s return to Spain inspired the Christian troops fighting the Moorish occupiers at the Battle of Clavijo in 844. He appeared on a white cloud and urged them on with his sword. The crusaders shouted to him: &ldquo;Santiago y cierra Espana! St James, we will reconquer Spain!&rdquo; The story reinforced the Catholic Church&rsquo;s identity as a crusading force whose great aim was to defeat Islam. Monarchs, including Carlos V and Felipe V, had their portraits painted sitting on horses and dressed in similar attire to the Moorkiller. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cervantes&rsquo; great hero, Don Quixote, called St James the Moorslayer &ldquo;one of the most valiant saints and knights that the world has ever had&rdquo;. The removal of the statue was welcomed by Muslims as &ldquo;a great step towards achieving peace&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Housaam El Mahmoudi, president of the Association of Moroccan Students in Santiago said that the statue&rsquo;s withdrawal would open the way to &ldquo;understanding and living together&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He added that Saint James the Moorkiller was one of Christianity&rsquo;s most savage symbols and &ldquo;a provocation to the Arab community&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But one conservative commentator, Cesar Lopez Llera, attacked the decision-makers, saying that it would not be long before &ldquo;they surprise us with the naming of a nun as bishop or the recommendation of the use of condoms to avoid Aids&rdquo;.
