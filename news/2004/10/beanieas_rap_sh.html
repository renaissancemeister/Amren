<h1><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/index.cfm/i/100804a_sigel">Beanie&rsquo;s Rap Sheet</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nekesa Mumbi Moody, AP, Oct. 8</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NEW YORK &mdash; Like a man given only a few months to live, Beanie Sigel has spent this year getting his business affairs in order. </p>
<p>The rapper known for grimy depictions of thug life has worked overtime to complete his third album, &ldquo;The B-Coming,&rdquo; so it can be released in December. He&rsquo;s finished all his scenes in the sequel to the 2002 gangsta flick &ldquo;State Property,&rdquo; which he starred in. And he&rsquo;s spent the last few days filming multiple music videos, even though they might not air for months. </p>
<p>Sigel isn&rsquo;t dying &mdash; but his life will change dramatically on Friday, when he&rsquo;s expected to be sentenced in a Philadelphia courtroom to about three years in prison on federal drug and weapons charges. And that won&rsquo;t end his legal troubles &mdash; he still faces a January retrial on an attempted murder charge. </p>
<p>&ldquo;[I&rsquo;m] just settin&rsquo; things up just in case I gotta go away, for my family &mdash; make sure everybody live comfortably, and maintains livin&rsquo; how they maintain living now,&rdquo; Sigel, born Dwight Grant, said cooly during an interview at his Roc-A-Fella record label offices. &ldquo;I gotta do that. Gotta plan and strategize.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t never prepare yourself for it,&rdquo; Sigel said of his potential sentence. &ldquo;You can set things up for other people who depend on you. But for yourself, you can&rsquo;t prepare yourself to go to jail, because you never know how it&rsquo;s going to be.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Although he may not be prepared for prison, Sigel has sold more than a million records glamorizing a criminal lifestyle. Like many of his peers, the majority of his raps depict drug slinging, gun toting, killing and torturing enemies, outwitting police, and worse &mdash; on one recent mixtape, he even raps about raping a pregnant woman. </p>
<p>While dozens of rappers from Jay-Z to P. Diddy have run afoul of the law, only about a half-dozen hip-hoppers with Sigel&rsquo;s star power have done prison time. Still, Sigel insists that the life he portrays only represents how he grew up &mdash; a poor child of Philadelphia, surrounded by drugs and crime &mdash; and does not reflect the way he lives today. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I may rap about a certain thing &hellip; [but] that&rsquo;s not me. I&rsquo;m an entertainer, so I&rsquo;m playing a role. That person that you see in &lsquo;State Property&rsquo; the movie, or you hear on one of those songs &mdash; that&rsquo;s what I do to make money, that&rsquo;s my job,&rdquo; said Sigel. &ldquo;Just like any actor. Like I said before, you&rsquo;ve got the Terminator who&rsquo;s the governor. He kills up everybody in his movies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn&rsquo;t have the rap sheet to go along with the image. Police say Sigel&rsquo;s been getting into trouble since he was a teen, and in 1996 he received probation after pleading guilty to drug possession with intent to deliver. </p>
<p>Two critically and commercially successful albums &mdash; 1999&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Truth and 2001&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Reason&rdquo; &mdash; made him a certified rap star. But in 2001, he was arrested for assault twice. </p>
<p>His most serious problems began last year, when in three separate instances he was charged with assault, drug and weapons offenses and then attempted murder for a shooting that left a man seriously injured. The attempted murder trial ended in a mistrial this spring. </p>
<p>Sigel pleaded guilty earlier this year to drugs and weapons charges; in the interview, he declined to discuss why. However, he proclaimed he&rsquo;s innocent of attempted murder, and repeatedly said he was being persecuted because he&rsquo;s a rich black rapper. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We control a situation that generates billions of dollars for ourself, and we dominate in this. Yeah we&rsquo;ve been targeted,&rdquo; he says of rappers. </p>
<p>Damon Dash, who co-founded the Roc-A-Fella label with Jay-Z, agreed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to use his lyrical content &hellip; to back up what their suspicions are. I definitely believe he&rsquo;s a victim of perception,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Cathie Abookire, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia district attorney, denied that: &ldquo;Beanie Sigel is going on trial for an attempted murder. That is why he was he was arrested, that is why he was charged, and that is why he&rsquo;s going to trial.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sigel didn&rsquo;t help his image by promoting his State Property clothing line with boasts that the jeans had special pockets for hiding weapons. Sigel now says that was a publicity stunt. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Controversy sells. We ain&rsquo;t never made no jeans that could hold no weapons &hellip; it was just something to draw attention,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
