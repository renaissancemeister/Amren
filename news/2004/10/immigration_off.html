<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The top immigration official for Colorado, Wyoming and Utah is under federal investigation for allegedly having a relationship with the estranged wife of a man his agency is seeking to deport.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service&rsquo;s Northwest Region would not discuss the details of the investigation of Mario Ortiz, the district director for the agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are allegations against (Ortiz) that are being investigated,&rdquo; Sharon Rummery said Friday. &ldquo;Anytime we receive allegations, we are going to launch an internal investigation. We take all allegations seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case involves an acrimonious divorce between Jon Vaupel, a 42-year-old Australian national, and his American wife, Stacy Schwab, 41.</p>
<p>The two married in Australia in 2002 and moved to the Denver-area in late 2003.</p>
<p>Schwab sponsored her husband when he applied to become a resident alien.</p>
<p>But in April, the couple got into an argument while Vaupel was holding their toddler son and Schwab was arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence and child abuse.</p>
<p>She later pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment by striking, shoving or kicking and was ordered into a one-year diversion program.</p>
<p>Schwab could not be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>Vaupel says Schwab never forgave him for calling police and vowed she would get even with him, according to an immigration petition.</p>
<p>According to court records, Vaupel was arrested two months later for forgery, assault and harassment.</p>
<p>He says the charges are trumped up. The case has not yet gone to trial.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Schwab filed several complaints against Vaupel, two of which were unfounded, according to police reports.</p>
<p>In July, Vaupel filed for divorce and got visitation rights for his son, but Schwab failed to bring the boy to several of the appointments, according to immigration records.</p>
<p>Vaupel hired a private investigator to follow his wife and the investigator claims to have seen Schwab staying at Ortiz&rsquo;s home on at least one occasion.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Higgins, one of Vaupel&rsquo;s attorneys, said she has pictures taken by the investigator that corroborate that claim.</p>
<p>One picture, Higgins said, shows Schwab and Ortiz carrying bags from Schwab&rsquo;s car in front of Ortiz&rsquo;s home. Another shows Ortiz leaning into Schwab&rsquo;s car, as if to kiss her.</p>
<p>In a divorce court hearing, Schwab said she had met with Ortiz, but that the meetings were purely professional.</p>
<p>In July, Schwab withdrew her sponsorship of Vaupel &mdash; which would lead to his being deported. The letter granting the petition for withdrawal was signed by Ortiz.</p>
<p>On Oct. 12, Vaupel went to the Jefferson County Courthouse for a pretrial conference in the criminal case against him and was picked up by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>He is now being held at the Immigration Detention Facility in Adams County.</p>
<p>Vaupel&rsquo;s attorneys say they are concerned about Ortiz&rsquo;s alleged relationship with Schwab and what they say is an accelerated effort to deport their client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly it&rsquo;s just coincidence, but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem coincidental to me,&rdquo; Higgins said of the speed with which the immigration case is being handled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) won&rsquo;t allow Mr. Vaupel to have a hearing, they won&rsquo;t tell him if and when he&rsquo;s going to be deported, they are obviously aware of the significant irregularities if not corruption involving his care, and yet they continue to detain him,&rdquo; Higgins said.</p>
<p>Mark O&rsquo;Regan, who heads the Australian Consulate in Denver, said he is keeping an eye on the case, but is not allowed, under Australian law, to comment on it.</p>
