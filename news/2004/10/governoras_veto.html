<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>SAN DIEGO &mdash; Last year, as he ran for governor criticizing the passage of a law that would allow illegal immigrants, most of them Hispanic, to get driver&rsquo;s licenses, Arnold Schwarzenegger was criticized for not being sensitive enough to Hispanic issues. </p>
<p>Now, after his round of bill signings and vetoes as governor, that criticism has emerged again. </p>
<p>Bills championing causes important to many Hispanics &mdash; such as a revived driver&rsquo;s license bill to replace the law repealed early in Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s administration or reparations for Americans illegally deported to Mexico in the 1930s &mdash; were vetoed by Schwarzenegger last month. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why some observers and legislators said the governor missed a chance to win favor with the state&rsquo;s largest ethnic group, a move that could cost him politically. </p>
<p>In addition to vetoing the driver&rsquo;s license bill, which Schwarzenegger said would weaken national security, he vetoed bills to allow survivors of the forced repatriation to Mexico the chance to file claims against the state. </p>
<p>Other vetoes nixed creation of an advisory commission on Latino affairs; a ban on grape growers requiring farm workers to taste unwashed grapes in the field; and required minimum rest periods for hotel maids in temperature-controlled break rooms. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very disappointing that so many of these bills were in fact vetoed,&rdquo; said Francisco Estrada, public policy director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. </p>
<p>Margita Thompson, Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s spokeswoman, disagreed with the perception there was an anti-Hispanic cast to the governor&rsquo;s vetoes. </p>
<p>Schwarzenegger, she said, is addressing the needs of the state as a whole, with his greatest attention going toward improving the climate for businesses and jobs and strengthening education, which will benefit all Californians regardless of ethnic group. </p>
<p>The governor, Thompson said, backed bills that will help Hispanics, such as laws to provide more housing options for farm workers, assistance for low-income home buyers and victims of hate crimes, and legislation to help cover the costs of treating people exposed to pesticide drift. </p>
<p>Still, Estrada said, the veto of the bill regarding the forced deportations, which may have affected as many 2 million people nationwide, particularly stung. </p>
<p>That bill, written by Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, would have given survivors a two-year window in which to file claims. It was modeled after a law to help victims of the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and others, Estrada said. </p>
<p>It would have been a harmless and fruitful gesture for the governor to allow establishment of the privately funded commission to investigate the deportations, Estrada said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have thought at the very least, since so very little is known about this particularly shameful period in history, that the commission bill would have been signed,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Dunn said he believes Schwarzenegger vetoed the measures to avoid putting state at risk financially for reparations to the victims, which he called &ldquo;hypocrisy at its worst.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;An injustice is an injustice,&rdquo; Dunn said, &ldquo;and it must be corrected the way we&rsquo;re done it for other survivors, to give them their day in court.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s veto message said no law was needed to create the commission, which Dunn called &ldquo;nonsensical.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The senator said he would raise the issue again in January, just as supporters of the driver&rsquo;s license bill said they would try again. </p>
<p>Harry Pachon, president of the Los Angeles-based Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, said Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s vetoes of bills dear to Hispanics were &ldquo;drops of water&rdquo; that will build opposition to him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to have to overcome that sort of nagging suspicion that he automatically vetoes anything that comes up that&rsquo;s tied to Latinos,&rdquo; Pachon said. </p>
<p>Just because some Hispanic activists wanted some bills doesn&rsquo;t mean all Hispanics did, said Assemblyman Robert Pacheco of Walnut, head of the Hispanic Republican Caucus. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When you talk about them in that form you make an assumption that the entire Latino community feels one way, and that&rsquo;s just not true,&rdquo; Pacheco said. </p>
<p>He said Schwarzenegger made decisions that helped Hispanics, such as his veto of an increase in the minimum wage, which Pacheco said would have eliminated entry-level jobs that often go to Hispanics. </p>
<p>Pacheco also noted Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s settlement of a 4-year-old lawsuit to improve conditions in 2,400 low-performing schools, many of them in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The millions and millions of dollars that are going to be poured into schools with Latino children are going to be very beneficial to the community,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>But Pachon said Schwarzenegger missed opportunities to at least symbolically reach out to Hispanics, such as recently canceling a trip to the border region of northern Mexico. His predecessor, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, went to Mexico shortly after taking office in 1999. </p>
<p>Thompson said while Schwarzenegger hasn&rsquo;t visited Mexico yet, he has met with governors of key Mexican border states. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Pachon said, &ldquo;what looks like a pattern is emerging. And that pattern is that he&rsquo;s not sensitive to Latino issues. It&rsquo;s going to be brought up against him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dunn, whose own district is about 60 percent Hispanic, said that with Hispanics making up a third of the state&rsquo;s population, Schwarzenegger would be wise to act more cautiously. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The governor must ensure that he&rsquo;s never perceived as turning his back on any single community as large as our California Latino community,&rdquo; Dunn said. &ldquo;That perception has clearly settled in.&rdquo; </p>
