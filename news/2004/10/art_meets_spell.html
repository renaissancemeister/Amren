<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before Miami artist Maria Alquilar completed a $40,000 ceramic mural recently installed outside a Livermore, Calif., library, she might have wanted to step inside to consult an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Of the 175 brightly colored words in the mosaic &mdash; a testament to literary and historic figures such as Einstein, Shakespeare and Van Gogh &mdash; 11 were misspelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This work is a fantastic work,&rdquo; said Alquilar, perplexed and frazzled by all the fuss. &ldquo;It was meant to bring particularly young people an understanding of the interlacing of cultures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the artistic faux pas was noticed within days of the installation in March, the city of Livermore &mdash; a suburb outside San Francisco &mdash; agreed this week to pay an additional $6,000 plus travel expenses for Alquilar&rsquo;s return to fix the errors.</p>
<p>No, thank you, says the artist. She&rsquo;s not about to fly to California until the museum issues an apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite frankly, I&rsquo;m really upset about this,&rdquo; Alquilar said. &ldquo;Nobody at the library has said what a great work it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the folks at the Livermore library can&rsquo;t quite overlook the mosaic &ldquo;typos&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Einstein sans one &ldquo;n&rdquo;; Shakespeare minus one &ldquo;a;&rdquo; Van Gogh with a &ldquo;u&rdquo; in it; Michelangelo plus an extra &ldquo;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our library director is very frustrated that she has this lovely new library and it has all these misspellings in front,&rdquo; Livermore City Councilwoman Lorraine Dietrich told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t concerned with the words, they were signposts,&rdquo; meant to stimulate an interest in learning, Alquilar told The Herald on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People that really love art, they wouldn&rsquo;t even have noticed it if they hadn&rsquo;t pointed it out,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Alquilar, a former schoolteacher, was among four artists who applied for the job. It took her a year to create the mural.</p>
<p>She says that shifting the focus to an &ldquo;inconsequential&rdquo; oversight and away from the work misses the point entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to the book and flip it open, because you don&rsquo;t do that when you&rsquo;re sculpting,&rdquo; explained Alquilar, whose works have been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution and the Rockefeller Collection, among other museums and galleries. &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t even think of checking because I thought they were right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, she added, during the installation process there were &ldquo;a million&rdquo; other people around who could have caught the errors. Although Alquilar finished the project in 2002, it wasn&rsquo;t installed until this spring.</p>
<p>Livermore Assistant City Manager James Piper agreed: &ldquo;I think everyone feels there had been an opportunity to have noticed [the mistakes] before and did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alquilar, who has lived in Miami for eight years and has a studio in the Design District, wished that her critics were a bit more enlightened themselves.</p>
<p>Said Alquilar: &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Shakespeare&rdquo; &mdash; with both a&rsquo;s &mdash; &ldquo;who wrote: &lsquo;That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
