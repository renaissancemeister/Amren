						For 
                          as long as official statistics have been kept, blacks 
                          in white societies have been overrepresented in all 
                          indices of social pathology: crime, illegitimacy, poverty, 
                          school failure, and long-term unemployment. The conventional 
                          liberal explanation for this is white &#147;racism,&#148; 
                          past and present, which has forced blacks into self-destructive 
                          choices. More clear-headed observers, however, have 
                          sought a partial explanation in the low average IQ of 
                          blacks.</font></p>
                                                <p>Low IQ can lead to crime 
                          because less intelligent children do poorly at school 
                          and fail to learn the skills needed to get well-paid 
                          jobs, or even any job. Unemployment is therefore two 
                          to three times higher among blacks than whites. People 
                          without jobs need money, and have relatively little 
                          to lose by robbery or burglary, and may therefore commit 
                          property crimes. The association between low intelligence 
                          and crime holds for whites as well, among whom the average 
                          IQ of criminals is about 84.</font></p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, as Charles 
                          Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein showed in their 
                          book <i>The Bell Curve</i>, low IQ cannot entirely explain 
                          a black crime rate that is six-and-a-half times the 
                          white rate. When blacks and whites are matched for IQ, 
                          blacks still commit crimes at two-and-a-half times the 
                          white rate. This shows that blacks must have some other 
                          characteristic, besides low intelligence, that explains 
                          their high levels of criminality. </font></p>

                        <p>Prof. Herrnstein and 
                          Dr. Murray found the same race and IQ relationship for 
                          social problems other than crime: unemployment, illegitimacy, 
                          poverty, and living on welfare. All of these are more 
                          frequent among blacks and are related to low IQ, and 
                          low IQ goes some way towards explaining them, but these 
                          social problems remain greater among blacks than among 
                          whites with the same IQs. Low intelligence is therefore 
                          not the whole explanation. Prof. Herrnstein and Dr. 
                          Murray did not offer any suggestions as to what the 
                          additional factors responsible for the greater prevalence 
                          of these social problems among blacks might be. They 
                          concluded only that &#147;some ethnic differences are 
                          not washed away by controlling for either intelligence 
                          or for any other variables that we examined. We leave 
                          those remaining differences unexplained and look forward 
                          to learning from our colleagues where the explanations 
                          lie&#148; (p. 340).</font></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><b>Psychopathic Personality</font></b></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>I propose that the variable 
                          that explains these differences is that blacks are more 
                          psychopathic than whites. Just as racial groups differ 
                          in average IQ, they can also differ in average levels 
                          of other psychological traits, and racial differences 
                          in the tendency towards psychopathic personality would 
                          explain virtually all the differences in black and white 
                          behavior left unexplained by differences in IQ.</font></p>
                        <p>Psychopathic personality 
                          is a personality disorder of which the central feature 
                          is lack of a moral sense. The condition was first identified 
                          in the early nineteenth century by the British physician 
                          John Pritchard, who proposed the term &#147;moral imbecility&#148; 
                          for those deficient in moral sense but of normal intelligence. 
                          The term psychopathic personality was first used in 
                          1915 by the German psychiatrist Emile Kraepelin and 
                          has been employed as a diagnostic label throughout the 
                          twentieth century. In 1941 the condition was described 
                          by Hervey Cleckley in what has become a classic book, 
                          <i>The Mask of Sanity</i>. He described the condition 
                          as general poverty of emotional feelings, lack of remorse 
                          or shame, superficial charm, pathological lying, egocentricity, 
                          a lack of insight, absence of nervousness, an inability 
                          to love, impulsive antisocial acts, failure to learn 
                          from experience, reckless behavior under the influence 
                          of alcohol, and a lack of long-term goals.</font></p>
                        <p>In 1984 the American 
                          Psychiatric Association dropped the term psychopathic 
                          personality and replaced it with &#147;anti-social personality 
                          disorder.&#148; This is an expression of the increasing 
                          sentimentality of the second half of the twentieth century, 
                          in which terms that had acquired negative associations 
                          were replaced by euphemisms. There are other examples. 
                          Mentally retarded children are now called &#147;slow 
                          learners&#148; or even &#147;exceptional children;&#148; 
                          aggressive children now have &#147;externalizing behaviors;&#148; 
                          prostitutes are &#147;sex workers;&#148; tramps are 
                          now &#147;the homeless,&#148; as if their houses were 
                          destroyed by earthquake; and people on welfare are &#147;clients&#148; 
                          of social workers. However, the term psychopathic personality 
                          remains useful. </font></p>
                        <p>While psychopathic personality 
                          is a psychiatric disorder, it has long been regarded 
                          as the extreme expression of a personality trait that 
                          is continuously distributed throughout the population. 
                          In this respect it is like other psychiatric disorders. 
                          For instance, severe depression is a psychiatric disorder, 
                          but everyone feels depressed sometimes, and some normal 
                          people are depressed more often and more severely than 
                          others. It is the same with psychopathic personality. 
                          There are degrees of moral sense throughout the population, 
                          and psychopaths are the extreme group.</font></p>
                        <p>There is a difference 
                          between blacks and whites&mdash;analogous to the difference 
                          in intelligence&mdash;in psychopathic personality considered 
                          as a personality trait. Both psychopathic personality 
                          and intelligence are bell curves with different means 
                          and distributions among blacks and whites. For intelligence, 
                          the mean and distribution are both lower among blacks. 
                          For psychopathic personality, the mean and distribution 
                          are higher among blacks. The effect of this is that 
                          there are more black psychopaths and more psychopathic 
                          behavior among blacks.</font> </font></p>

                        <p>In 1994 the American 
                          Psychiatric Association issued a revised Diagnostic 
                          Manual listing 11 features of anti-social personality 
                          disorder: (1) inability to sustain consistent work behavior; 
                          (2) failure to conform to social norms with respect 
                          to lawful behavior [this is a euphemism for being a 
                          criminal]; (3) irritability and aggressivity, as indicated 
                          by frequent physical fights and assaults; (4) repeated 
                          failure to honor financial obligations; (5) failure 
                          to plan ahead or impulsivity; (6) no regard for truth, 
                          as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or &#147;conning&#148; 
                          others; (7) recklessness regarding one&rsquo;s own or 
                          others&rsquo; personal safety, as indicated by driving 
                          while intoxicated or recurrent speeding; (8) inability 
                          to function as a responsible parent; (9) failure to 
                          sustain a monogamous relationship for more than one 
                          year; (10) lacking remorse; (11) the presence of conduct 
                          disorder in childhood. </font></p>
                        <p>This is a useful list. 
                          Curiously, however, it fails to include the deficiency 
                          of moral sense that is the core of the condition, although 
                          this is implicit in virtually every feature of the disorder. 
                          All of these behaviors are more prevalent among blacks 
                          than among whites, and suggest that blacks have a higher 
                          average tendency towards psychopathic personality.</font></p>
                        <p>Questionnaires can be 
                          used to measure psychopathic personality in normal populations. 
                          The first to be constructed was the Minnesota Multiphasic 
                          Personality Inventory (MMPI), which was devised in the 
                          1930s. This instrument consists of a series of scales 
                          for the measurement of a variety of psychiatric conditions 
                          regarded as continuously distributed in the population, 
                          such as hysteria, mania and depression, and includes 
                          the Psychopathic Deviate Scale for the measurement of 
                          psychopathic personality.</font></p>
                        <p>During the 65 or so 
                          years following its publication, the MMPI has been administered 
                          to a great many groups. Mean scores have been published 
                          by different investigators for a number of samples of 
                          blacks, whites, Asian-Americans, Hispanics and American 
                          Indians. All of these studies show a consistent pattern: 
                          Blacks and Indians have the highest psychopathic scores. 
                          Hispanics come next followed by whites. Ethnic Japanese 
                          and Chinese have the lowest scores. The same rank order 
                          of racial groups is found for all the expressions of 
                          psychopathic personality listed by the American Psychiatric 
                          Association, and these differences are found in both 
                          children and adults. </font></p>

                        <p><b>Conduct Disorder</font></b></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The terms psychopathic 
                          personality and anti-social personality disorder, however, 
                          are not used for children or young adolescents up to 
                          the age of 15 years. They are instead said to have conduct 
                          disorders. The principal criteria set out by the American 
                          Psychiatric Association (1994) for a diagnosis of conduct 
                          disorder are persistent stealing, lying, truancy, running 
                          away from home, fighting, arson, burglary, vandalism, 
                          sexual precocity and cruelty. Childhood conduct disorder 
                          is therefore an analogue of psychopathic personality 
                          in older adolescents and adults. A number of studies 
                          have shown that conduct disorder in children is a frequent 
                          precursor of psychopathic behavior. </font></p>
                        <p>Studies have found that 
                          the prevalence of conduct disorders is about twice as 
                          high among blacks as among whites. This is the case 
                          not only in the United States but also in Britain and 
                          the Netherlands. Other racial groups also differ in 
                          the prevalence of conduct disorders among children. 
                          As with all the other expressions of psychopathic personality, 
                          conduct disorders are frequent among American Indians. 
                          </font></p>
                        <p>Children with conduct 
                          disorders are sometimes suspended or expelled from school 
                          because of constant misbehavior, particularly aggression. 
                          In both the United States and Britain, black children 
                          are disciplined in this way three or four times as frequently 
                          as white children, while East Asians have low discipline 
                          rates. In misbehavior in schools, as in so much else, 
                          East Asians are the &#147;model minority.&#148; In the 
                          United States, Indians have a high discipline rate. 
                          </font></p>
                        <p>Lack of honesty is one 
                          of the core features of the psychopathic personality, 
                          and one measure of this characteristic is the default 
                          rates on student loans. About half of American college 
                          students take out loans but not all graduates repay 
                          them. The 1987 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study 
                          consisting of 6,338 cases reports default rates as follows: 
                          whites&mdash;5 percent, Hispanics&mdash;20 percent, American 
                          Indians&mdash;45 percent, blacks&mdash;55 percent.</font></p>
                        <p>Bad credit ratings also 
                          reflect a failure to honor financial obligations. A 
                          report by Freddie Mac of 12,000 households in 1999 found 
                          the highest percentage of poor credit ratings was among 
                          blacks (48 percent). The next highest was among Hispanics 
                          (34 percent), while whites had the lowest at 27 percent.

                        <p>A prominent feature 
                          of psychopathic personality is a high level of aggression, 
                          which is expressed in a number of ways including homicide, 
                          robbery, assault, and rape. All of these are crimes, 
                          so racial and ethnic differences appear in crime rates. 
                          High black crime rates have been documented by Jared 
                          Taylor and the late Glayde Whitney in <i>The Color of 
                          Crime</i>. For homicide, rates for black males are about 
                          six times the white rate, and for black females they 
                          are about four times higher. The homicide rate for East 
                          Asians is about half that of whites. The high homicide 
                          rate of blacks is also found in South Africa, and homicide 
                          is generally higher in black countries than in white 
                          and East Asian countries. </font></p>
                        <p> As regards other crimes, 
                          the robbery rate for blacks is about twelve times the 
                          white rate, while the assault rate is about five times 
                          higher. The high black rates for these crimes are followed 
                          in descending order by Hispanics, American Indians, 
                          whites and East Asians. The rate for rape is about five-and-a-half 
                          times greater for blacks than whites, and two to three 
                          times greater among Hispanics and Indians as compared 
                          to whites, while East Asians commit rape at about half 
                          the white rate. </font></p>
                        <p> Domestic violence shows 
                          the same race differences. Severe violence by husbands 
                          against wives is about four times more common among 
                          blacks as whites. Black wives assault their husbands 
                          at about twice the white rate. American Indians assault 
                          their spouses even more often than blacks do. High crime 
                          rates among blacks have been found not only in the United 
                          States but also in Britain, France, Canada and Sweden.</font></p>
                        <p> A prominent feature 
                          of psychopathic personality is an inability to form 
                          stable, long-term loving relationships. David Lykken, 
                          a leading expert on psychopathic personalities, writes 
                          of the psychopath&rsquo;s &#147;undeveloped ability to 
                          love or affiliate with others,&#148; and Robert Hare, 
                          another leading expert, writes that &#147;psychopaths 
                          view people as little more than objects to be used for 
                          their own gratification&#148; and &#147;equate love 
                          with sexual arousal.&#148; </font></p>
                        <p>Marriage is the most 
                          explicit expression of long-term love, and a number 
                          of studies have shown that blacks attach less value 
                          to marriage than whites. Questionnaire surveys have 
                          found that blacks are less likely than whites to agree 
                          that &#147;marriage is for life.&#148; Two American 
                          sociologists, R. Staples and L. B. Johnson, write that 
                          &#147;Blacks do not rank marriage as highly as whites&#148; 
                          and that &#147;Black Americans&rsquo; acceptance of this 
                          form of relationship is inconsistent with their African 
                          heritage.&#148;</font></p>
                        <p>In a study of an American 
                          sample of 2,059 married people, C. L. Broman found that 
                          &#147;blacks are significantly less likely to feel that 
                          their marriages are harmonious and are significantly 
                          less likely to be satisfied with their marriages.&#148; 
                          Other studies of racial and ethnic differences in attitudes 
                          have found that whites think about marriage more often 
                          than blacks, and have a stronger desire than blacks 
                          to find the right marriage partner. There are also racial 
                          differences in rates of cohabitation, which also reflects 
                          a commitment to a long-term relationship. A survey of 
                          24-to 29-year-olds in Britain found that 68 percent 
                          of whites had cohabited but only 38 percent of blacks. 
                          </font></p>
                        <p>Blacks in the United 
                          States, Britain, France and the Caribbean are less likely 
                          than whites to marry or enter into stable relationships. 
                          In an American survey of 18-to 64-year-olds carried 
                          out from 1990 to 1996, 61 percent of whites were married 
                          but only 35 percent of blacks. The most likely to be 
                          married were East Asians (66 percent). Fifty-five percent 
                          of Hispanics and 48 percent of American Indians were 
                          married. The same race differences are found in Britain. 
                          In a survey carried out in 1991, among 30-to 34-year-olds 
                          68 percent of whites were married but only 34 percent 
                          of blacks. Studies of marriage rates for France in the 
                          1990s have also found that blacks are less likely to 
                          be married than whites. These differences are also found 
                          for cohabitation, with fewer blacks living in unmarried 
                          cohabitation relationships than whites.</font></p>
                        <p>Differences in marriage 
                          rates are reflected in differences in illegitimacy rates. 
                          In the United States, black illegitimacy rates are down 
                          slightly from their high in 1994, when 70.4 percent 
                          of black women who gave birth were unmarried. The 2000 
                          figure of 68.7 is still the highest for any racial group, 
                          and is followed by American Indians at 58.4 percent, 
                          Hispanics 42.7 percent, whites 22.1 percent, and Asians 
                          14.8 percent. The Asian figure includes populations 
                          with greatly differing illegitimacy rates, with native 
                          Hawaiians, for example, at 50 percent, Japanese at 9.5 
                          percent, and Chinese at 7.6 percent. </font></p>
                        <p>Low rates of stable 
                          relationships are found among blacks in the Caribbean 
                          islands. In a review of the literature the sociologists 
                          B. Ram and G. E. Ebanks write that &#147;In the Caribbean 
                          in general &hellip; there is a substantial amount of movement 
                          from one sex partner to another and also a very high 
                          percentage of reproduction outside marriage.&#148;</font></p>

                        <p>When they do marry, 
                          blacks are less tolerant than whites of monogamous constraints. 
                          An extreme form of intolerance is murder of one&rsquo;s 
                          spouse. In Detroit in 1982-3, 63 percent of the population 
                          was black but 90.5 percent of those who killed their 
                          spouses were black. Less extreme forms of aversion to 
                          monogamy are adultery and divorce. The Kinsey data on 
                          college graduates, collected in the 1940s and 1950s, 
                          found that 51 percent of blacks were unfaithful to their 
                          spouses during the first two years of marriage compared 
                          with 23 percent of whites. Several other studies have 
                          confirmed that the incidence of marital infidelity is 
                          greater among blacks than among whites. Blacks cite 
                          infidelity more frequently than whites as a cause of 
                          divorce.</font></p>
                        <p>Blacks also have more 
                          sexual partners than whites. The Kinsey survey found 
                          that about twice as many black college graduates had 
                          had six or more partners before marriage than whites. 
                          Many later studies have confirmed this. A survey of 
                          2,026 15-to-18-year-olds in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s 
                          found that 38 percent of blacks had had five or more 
                          sexual partners, 26 percent of whites, 21 percent of 
                          Hispanics and eight percent of East Asians. </font></p>
                        <p> The same differences 
                          are found in Britain. In a study of a nationally representative 
                          sample of approximately 20,000 16-to 59-year-olds carried 
                          out in 1990, 36 percent of blacks had had two or more 
                          sexual partners during the previous five years, compared 
                          with 29 percent of whites and 18 percent of Asians.</font></p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>The impulsiveness component 
                          of psychopathic personality includes an inability or 
                          unwillingness to delay immediate gratification in the 
                          expectation of long-term advantage. The first study 
                          to demonstrate differences between blacks and whites 
                          in the delay of gratification was carried out by W. 
                          Mischel in Trinidad in the late 1950s. He offered black 
                          and white children the choice between a small candy 
                          bar now or a larger one in a week. He found black children 
                          were much more likely to ask for the small candy bar 
                          now, and this difference has been confirmed in three 
                          subsequent American studies. This racial difference 
                          has been noted but given different names by different 
                          writers. In <i>The Unheavenly City Revisited</i>, Edward 
                          Banfield writes of the &#147;extreme present-orientation&#148; 
                          of blacks, and Michael Levin writes of &#147;high time 
                          preference,&#148; an economist&rsquo;s term for preferring 
                          cash now rather than a greater sum in the future. </font></p>
                        <p>The APA Diagnostic Manual 
                          refers to the psychopathic personality&rsquo;s &#147;inability 
                          to sustain consistent work behavior,&#148; and a number 
                          of studies have shown that blacks are less motivated 
                          to work than whites and Asians, while Hispanics are 
                          intermediate. For example, black students do fewer hours 
                          of homework than whites and Asians. Among college students 
                          with the same Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, blacks 
                          get poorer grades than whites, probably because they 
                          don&rsquo;t work as hard. </font></p>
                        <p> This helps explain 
                          black unemployment. Several American ethnographic studies 
                          of inner city blacks have concluded that many are unwilling 
                          to work. Thus, E. Anderson writes that &#147;there are 
                          many unemployed black youth who are unmotivated and 
                          uninterested in working for a living, particularly in 
                          the dead-end jobs they are likely to get.&#148; The 
                          sociologist S. M. Petterson writes that &#147;it is 
                          commonly contended that young black men experience more 
                          joblessness than their white counterparts because they 
                          are less willing to seek out low paying jobs.&#148; 
                          American Asians are the opposite of blacks in this respect. 
                          They have low rates of unemployment and it has been 
                          shown by James Flynn that they achieve higher educational 
                          qualifications and earnings than would be predicted 
                          from their intelligence, suggesting they have strong 
                          work motivation.</font></p>
                        <p>In the United States, 
                          unemployment rates are highest among Indians followed 
                          in descending order by blacks, Hispanics, whites and 
                          ethnic Chinese and Japanese. These differences are frequently 
                          attributed to white racism but it is difficult to reconcile 
                          this explanation with the lower rate of unemployment 
                          among East Asians as compared with whites, and also 
                          with the higher rate of unemployment among Indians as 
                          compared to blacks.</font></p>
                        <p>Blacks in Britain, Canada 
                          and France are frequently unemployed. In Britain, the 
                          1991 census found that 26 percent of black men were 
                          unemployed, compared with 11 percent of whites and ethnic 
                          Chinese. In Canada in 1991, 13 percent of black men 
                          were unemployed compared with seven percent of whites. 
                          In France in 1994, 11 percent of black men were unemployed 
                          compared with eight percent of whites.</font></p>

                        <p> Psychopaths appear 
                          to enjoy taking risks because it stimulates them, and 
                          there are several ways in which blacks show greater 
                          recklessness and risk taking than whites or Asians. 
                          In the 1989-93 American Teenage Attitudes and Practices 
                          Survey, 9,135 youths aged 12 to 18 were asked to consider 
                          the question: &#147;I get a kick out of doing things 
                          every now and then that are a little risky or dangerous.&#148; 
                          Fifty-six point nine percent of blacks agreed, as compared 
                          with 38.6 percent of whites. Driving habits are an index 
                          of risk taking and recklessness. A number of studies 
                          have shown that blacks run red lights more often than 
                          whites, and have more frequent accidents. Five studies 
                          have shown that blacks do not use seat belts as often 
                          as whites. Hispanics and Native Americans likewise have 
                          more accidents caused by recklessness and risk-taking 
                          than whites and East Asians. </font></p>

                        <p>Sexual behavior can 
                          be reckless. Among those who do not wish to have children, 
                          blacks are less likely to use contraception than whites, 
                          and this has been found in both the United States and 
                          Britain. One result is that black women have more unplanned 
                          babies than whites. In the United States in the 1990s 
                          blacks had about twice the proportion of unplanned babies 
                          as whites and Asians. In Britain, a survey of teenage 
                          births carried out in 1994 found that these were three-and-a-half 
                          times more common among blacks than among whites and 
                          Asians.</font></p>
                        <p>The behavior of reckless 
                          men also causes unplanned pregnancies. Surveys have 
                          asked adolescent males if they would feel &#147;very 
                          pleased&#148; or whether they would care if they were 
                          responsible for an unplanned pregnancy. Twice as many 
                          blacks as whites say they would be very pleased or that 
                          they would not care. To be very pleased or not care 
                          about saddling a teenage girl with an unplanned pregnancy 
                          expresses a great degree of a reckless regarding the 
                          well-being of others. In the United States, the percentage 
                          of teenage blacks who have fathered an illegitimate 
                          child is approximately three times greater than that 
                          of whites, with Hispanics intermediate.</font></p>
                        <p>Another consequence 
                          of reckless avoidance of contraceptives is that blacks 
                          are more likely to get sexually transmitted diseases&mdash;including 
                          HIV and AIDS&mdash;all of which are more prevalent among 
                          blacks than among whites and Asians. At the present 
                          time, about 80 percent of the word&rsquo;s HIV carriers 
                          are blacks in sub-Saharan Africa. </font></p>
                        <p>A common expression 
                          of conduct disorder in children and young adolescents 
                          is sexual precocity. Many studies have shown that blacks 
                          are more sexually precocious than whites and Asians. 
                          Surveys in the United States in the 1990s have found 
                          that about a third of black 13-year-olds have had sexual 
                          intercourse compared with 14 percent of whites and Hispanics, 
                          and four percent of East Asians. Similarly, a survey 
                          in Britain in 1990 found that by the age of 16, 18 percent 
                          of blacks had had intercourse compared with 13 percent 
                          of whites and five percent of Asians.</font></p>
                        <p>We consider finally 
                          the psychopathic characteristic described by the American 
                          Psychiatric Association as &#147;inability to function 
                          as a responsible parent.&#148; One of the most straightforward 
                          measures of this is abuse and neglect. The American 
                          Association for Protecting Children has found that black 
                          children constitute approximately 15 percent of the 
                          child population and about 22 percent of cases of child 
                          abuse and neglect. The First (1975) and Second (1985) 
                          National Family Violence Surveys carried out in America 
                          examined the use of violence towards children, defined 
                          as hitting them with the fist or with some object, and 
                          kicking, biting and beating them up. It does not include 
                          slapping or spanking. It found that 1.2 percent of white 
                          parents and 2.1 percent of blacks inflict this kind 
                          of severe violence on their children.</font></p>
                        <p>Data published by the 
                          United States Department of Health and Human Services 
                          for 1996 showed that maltreatment was about three times 
                          more common among blacks and about one-and-a-half times 
                          more common among Hispanics, than among whites.</font></p>
                        <p> The most extreme expression 
                          of the inability to function as a responsible parent 
                          consists of killing a child. Racial differences in the 
                          homicide of infants in their first year of life were 
                          examined for approximately 35 million babies born in 
                          the United States between 1983-91. This study found 
                          that 2,776 of these had been murdered, the great majority 
                          by mothers or the mothers&rsquo; husbands or partners. 
                          The rate of infant homicides for blacks and Native Americans 
                          was 2 per 10,000, compared with 0.6 per 10,000 for whites 
                          and 0.4 per 10,000 for East Asians. In the early 1990s 
                          the racial differences became even greater, with blacks 
                          having four-and-a-half times the infant homicide rate 
                          of whites and Hispanics. </font></p>

                          consistency in the racial differences in outcomes that

                          In everything from child behavior to sexual precocity 
                          to adult crime rates we find Asians at one extreme, 
                          blacks at the other, and whites, Hispanics and American 
                          Indians in between. These differences are not only consistent 
                          through time but are found in countries such as France, 
                          Britain, Canada, and the United States, which have very 
                          different histories of what could be called &#147;racism.&#148; 
                          Indices of high psychopathic personality in blacks are 
                          likewise found in the virtually all-black societies 
                          of Africa and the Caribbean. </font></p>
                        <p>Racial differences in 
                          psychopathic behavior persist even when IQ is held constant, 
                          and the same racial differences are found in essentially 
                          every kind of measurable behavior that reflects psychopathic 
                          personality. The most plausible explanation for these 
                          differences is that just as there are racial differences 
                          in average IQ, there are racial differences in what 
                          could be called &#147;average personality,&#148; with 
                          blacks showing greater psychopathic tendencies. The 
                          argument that white &#147;racism&#148; is responsible 
                          for black social pathology is increasingly unconvincing.
