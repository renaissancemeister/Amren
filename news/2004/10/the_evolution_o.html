						<p>Readers of <i>AR</i>
will be aware of the well-documented race differences in intelligence and
temperament. The mean black score on valid IQ tests is 85, while the white
mean is 100 (and some Asian groups outscore whites). Black children adopted
into upper-middle class white families fail to attain IQs much above 85,
which implicates genes as the cause of this difference. Twin studies and
cross-cultural comparisons implicate genes in the greater levels of impulsiveness
and aggression also found in blacks.
<p>A less frequently noted point is that these psychological differences
suggest race differences in morality. Part of the difference may be due
simply to different levels of intelligence. The mean IQ of incarcerated
felons is about 90, and Lawrence Kohlberg&rsquo;s extensive research on children
found that IQ is correlated with moral development. It should not be surprising
that mental ability is linked to moral character, since the latter requires
grasping rules and thinking through the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp;
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/1coprob.gif" height="156" width="200" align="LEFT">However, different
levels of intelligence are not likely to be the sole cause of racial differences
in morality. Data reported in <i>The Bell Curve</i> (and noted in the February
issue of AR) show that black and white populations differ in crime and
illegitimacy rates even when IQ is held constant. Thus, in one large-scale
study, blacks in general were 6.5 times more likely to be incarcerated
than whites, but when the comparison was restricted to blacks and whites
with IQs of 100, blacks were still 2.5 times more likely to be incarcerated.&nbsp;

Temperament therefore appears to have an effect on behavior that is independent
of intelligence. This is intuitively obvious, as aggression easily becomes
heedlessness of the rights of others; we should therefore expect black
and white standards of behavior to differ.
<p>Examples of this difference abound. &#8220;Trash talk,&#8221; the stream of arrogant
banter with which black basketball players seek to intimidate and humiliate
opponents, is alien to white ideals of sportsmanship. Likewise, Montel
Williams, the host of a television talk show, claimed to have discovered
racial bias in a question on an IQ test that asked children what they would
do if they threw a baseball through a neighbor&rsquo;s window. The answer scored
as correct was offering to pay for the window, but Mr. Williams, who is
black, objected that in his old neighborhood a &#8220;Sorry, man&#8221; would have
sufficed. No doubt, Mr. Williams was right that blacks do attach less urgency
than whites to compensating damage.&nbsp;
<p>Numerous fights among blacks result from &#8220;dissing&#8221;-males seeking dominance
over each other by shows of disrespect – a practice that indicates disregard
for the golden rule. Moreover, it is hard to imagine a more blatant violation
of the golden rule than the constant demand for royalties by Martin Luther
King&rsquo;s estate whenever his speeches are published – especially when his own
plagiarism is justified as &#8220;voice merging.&#8221;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What Morality Is</font></b>
<p>Evolutionary biology suggests an explanation for race differences in
moral values. But first, to begin with a definition: An individual&rsquo;s &#8220;morality&#8221;
is <i>the rules he wants everyone to follow, and that he wants everyone
to want everyone to follow.</i> Honesty is a moral value for him if he
tries to be honest, tries to make his children honest, hopes others will
be honest, and encourages others to reinforce honesty. A group&rsquo;s morality
is the moral rules its members share.
<p>The clause about &#8220;wanting everyone to want everyone&#8221; is needed to distinguish
moral questions, like honesty, from other &#8220;universal&#8221; concerns. If you
are like most people, you think others ought to be honest. But you may
also think everyone should exercise, without considering exercise a &#8220;moral&#8221;
value. The difference between the two is not in their usefulness, since
both are useful: jogging is healthful, and honesty facilitates such profitable
activities as trade. But honesty, unlike exercise, is advantageous <i>only
if everyone else is honest.</i> Jogging strengthens my heart whether or
not you jog, whereas being honest helps me only insofar as it induces others
to reciprocate, allowing me to rely on their words. This is also why it
is smart to be honest even when tempted to lie – if you are found out, others
will feel no obligation to be honest with you.&nbsp;
<p>On the other hand, if everyone else is a liar, honesty only lets others
take advantage of you. Therefore, since honesty, self-restraint, and other
moral virtues are good ideas only when everyone thinks they are good ideas,
you not only want everyone else to be honest, you want everyone to encourage
others to be honest, and to ensure that honesty is widespread.
<p>The advantages of honesty and other virtues have a biological dimension.
Since moral individuals in a moral community do better than scoundrels,
they live longer and have more children. Obeying and reinforcing moral
rules is adaptive. If there is any genetic tendency to obey and reinforce
moral rules, a tendency to obey and reinforce them and to be susceptible
to reinforcement will be passed on to offspring.
<p>However, selection for morality need not have been uniform, since honesty,
cooperation, and the other virtues need not have been equally important
in all environments.&nbsp;<img src="/news/2004/10/2caveman.gif" height="171" width="165" align="LEFT">Cooperativeness
(like intelligence) was probably more adaptive in the colder, harsher,
Eurasian environment in which whites and Asians evolved than in sub-Saharan
Africa. Food grows year-round in a warm climate. There is little danger
of freezing to death, so it is not necessary to work together to build
large shelters. Sexual patterns are also influenced by environment: Since
a woman abandoned by her mate has a better chance of supporting herself
and her children in a benign environment, there is less pressure on women
to evolve a demand for male fidelity, or for males to evolve a strong sense
of attachment.&nbsp;
<p>The situation was otherwise in Eurasia, where large game was a dietary
staple. Bringing down a cornered mastodon takes cooperation, with each
man in his assigned position, ready to respond to shouted instructions.
There must be jointly acceptable rules for dividing the kill. And, since
females depend on male hunters for their own survival and that of their
children, an advantage would accrue to females who chose mates likely to
support them for a lifetime. Sexual selection would then mold males more
inclined to satisfy the female demand for fidelity.
<p>Environment does not consist merely of natural factors like climate.
Since morality is advantageous only when others are moral, a major determinant
of the fitness of an individual&rsquo;s &#8220;gene for morality&#8221; is the character
of those with whom he interacts. As Robert Axelrod and William Hamilton
put it in their classic study, &#8220;The Evolution of Cooperation&#8221; <i>(Science</i>
1981), &#8220;there is no single best strategy regardless of the behavior of
others in the population.&#8221; In fact, seemingly irrational levels of mistrust
can become locked into a group. Suppose a mild physical environment has
selected for weak cooperative tendencies. A worsening of the environment
might make greater cooperation in everyone&rsquo;s interest, but not necessarily
more fitness-enhancing, for any honest, helpful mutants who appear will
simply be exploited until they die without issue. It is perfectly rational
to be indifferent to others when they are indifferent to you.
<p>In short, observed race differences in honesty, sexual self-restraint,
and cooperativeness may be due to the fact that these traits did not have
the same evolutionary value in Africa that they did in Eurasia. Indeed,
since universality and reciprocity are built into the very concept of morals,
it is incorrect to talk of &#8220;different moralities.&#8221; It is more accurate
to say that individuals of Eurasian descent tend to be more moral than
individuals of African descent.&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Consequences</font></b>
<p>Nobody can go back in time to verify whether the races really developed
in the way outlined. Still, the hypothesis sketched above is plausible
enough, and it may be useful to note some of its implications.

<td>Black behavior that is unacceptable by white standards – theft, drug
use, preoccupation with sex – is not &#8220;sick.&#8221; It is how traits that were once
adaptive in Africa express themselves in Western urban society. This may
be part of the reason blacks seem not to experience white laws and standards
of personal responsibility as binding, and why black spokesmen are so curiously
unapologetic about black crime. They will caution black males that crime
is &#8220;stupid&#8221; (i.e. apt to lead to punishment), and a Jesse Jackson may denounce
black-on-black crime as harmful to blacks, but they do not say that crime,
particularly black-on-white crime, is intrinsically bad.
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/3robust.gif" height="226" width="117" align="RIGHT">In one remarkable
incident, Edmund Perry, a Harlem teenager recruited on full scholarship
to the prestigious boarding school of Exeter, was killed a few weeks after
graduation when he attempted to mug a plainclothes policeman. Angry demonstrations
ensued, in which blacks complained of Perry&rsquo;s alienation at Exeter. Far
from expressing regret over Perry&rsquo;s actions, blacks blamed white society
for them. In fact, the difficulties blacks experience in conforming to
American society cannot really be blamed on black attitudes <i>or</i> white
norms, but on the mismatch between the two.</td>

<td>Black children cannot be expected to respond as white children do to
externally imposed white socialization. If the races evolved different
values, black and white children will be receptive to different sorts of
training and exhortation, a point with important practical consequences.
It is often suggested, for instance, that black children would do better
in school if told, as white and Asian children are, that school is important.
But black children will not care about grades and the esteem of teachers,
no matter how much they are told to, if valuing knowledge is a more weakly
evolved norm among blacks. Since black societies never evolved formal education,
it would make no sense for black children to be ready to internalize praise
of education.</td>

<td>Violence will skyrocket when a group acquires a killing technology
it did not develop. Groups that have invented such things as firearms without
killing themselves off must also have developed sufficient inhibitions
about using them. Groups that acquire weapons from outside sources are
less likely to have evolved the same level of self-restraint, just as groups
that do not discover fermentation are unlikely to develop a tolerance for
alcohol, and often fall prey to drinking problems when alcohol is introduced
from outside. Blacks may have been unprepared for access to the firearms
developed in Western society.
<p>Consider the remarkable increase in gunshot homicides among black men
in the last half-century. In 1943 there were 44 handgun homicides in New
York City; in 1992, 1,500 black males died of gunshot wounds inflicted
by other black males. Since 92 percent of the 2,200 murders recorded in
New York that year were committed by blacks, black males must have also
killed several hundred non-blacks with firearms as well. The parallel increase
in gunshot homicides nationally over the same period is essentially an
increase among blacks.
<p>Now, the sheer availability of guns does not automatically mean murder.
Guns have been available for centuries to the whites who invented and manufacture
them. Every adult male Swiss citizen owns a gun, yet the annual homicide
rate in Switzerland is one two-hundredth that of Washington, D.C. or Harlem.
The immediate cause of the rise in homicide has been the sudden availability
of guns <i>to blacks, </i>who seem ready to resort to firearms in disputes
that whites would regard as trivial. (Gunfights over calls in pick-up basketball
games are not uncommon in New York City.) It may well be that blacks lack
the restraints that would have evolved during the march to the invention
of firearms – a possibility that should be considered in any discussion of
gun control. If the &#8220;gun problem&#8221; is really the problem of black access
to firearms, forbidding whites to have guns is pointless and unjust.</td>

<td>Moral signals may become confused when divergent groups interact. To
explain the point with a crude example, suppose that blacks, being less
empathetic than whites, must use stronger signals to rouse each others&rsquo;
solicitude. It takes angry shouting to get another black to notice an injury
that a white can be induced to attend to by less strident means. Likewise,
a white will take an angry shout as expressing a more serious injury. If
these signal patterns have themselves become innate in the two populations,
whites will interpret the signals of blacks as if they were coming from
other whites, and consistently <i>overestimate</i> the seriousness of injuries
claimed by blacks.&nbsp;
<p>The tendency of whites to interpret the angrier manner of blacks as
if blacks were other whites leads whites to respond to black complaints
with inappropriate generosity, thereby reinforcing black anger by teaching
blacks that anger is rewarded. The result is intensified demands and further
white confusion – a dynamic that may explain the puzzling phenomenon of white
guilt, and the indulgence of many whites toward even the most unreasonable
black demands.</td>

Whites will continue to consider blacks &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and blacks will,
more openly, continue to call whites &#8220;up tight.&#8221; But the practical decisions
of life require the adoption of some standards, and a group can use only
those standards evolution has given it.
<p>What by white standards is a black deficiency in morality – defined as
conformity to the golden rule – explains the persistent unwillingness of
the races to associate with each other. People almost by definition prefer
the company of those who share their values, so it is no wonder that whites
feel more comfortable with whites. Indeed, while blacks – even including
Malcolm X – prefer to send their children to white schools and to use the
other amenities of white society, blacks nevertheless prefer the company
of blacks. The conventional idea is that these preferences are entirely
due to &#8220;prejudice&#8221; that can and should be extirpated by education (i.e.
propaganda). But if preference for one&rsquo;s own kind is due to deep-seated
differences in values, there seems nothing wrong with it, and there certainly
seems no reason for it to be illegal.
<p>Moreover, from their own point of view, whites are <i>right</i> to prefer
their own company. By white standards, adherence to the golden rule and
norms associated with it are the chief criteria of personal merit. Since
blacks are on average less likely than whites to adhere to the golden rule – less
cooperative, more aggressive, less respectful of property and persons – the
average black is, by white standards, not as good a person as the average
white. This is perhaps the least politically correct statement it is possible
to make, but it is true and must be made. And, put in non-racial terms,
it is one that even liberal egalitarians would assent to. Even they would
admit to preferring the company of people who are less apt to steal, kill,
lie, cheat, and shout them down in a debate.
<p>It is possible to argue on purely philosophical grounds that people
should be able to associate with whomever they please. This right, after
all, can be enjoyed by everyone, and is itself in conformity with the golden
rule. And this right, which implies that whites can &#8220;discriminate&#8221; in favor
of other whites in housing, employment, and the schools to which they send
their children, has been contravened by civil rights laws. This was allowed
to happen because Americans, who respect freedom but also like to see that
freedom is not abused, became convinced by the 1960s that use of the freedom
of association to avoid blacks was entirely arbitrary. They became convinced
that it could be motivated only by ignorance and hatred, and saw no reason
not to forbid actions so maliciously based. Race differences in moral outlook,
which people have long sensed, are perfectly good, non-arbitrary reasons
for whites to wish to avoid blacks. Perhaps when this is more widely realized
whites will once again permit themselves this liberty.&nbsp;<img src="/news/2004/10/textend.gif" alt="Text end." height="8" width="11">
