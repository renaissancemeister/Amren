<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						I spend a great amount of my time reading articles 
  from the National Library of Medicine, or recently published books, in my work 
  as a health journalist. On occasion I run across some information that appears 
  to be similar to something else I have read recently. This happened when I was 
  researching the topic of whooping cough, which is on the rise in the U.S. The 
  pertussis vaccine for this disease is now being widely promoted by health authorities 
  since immunity may have worn off from inoculation years ago. I was searching 
  for a map to show where pertussis outbreaks are concentrated. Here is the map 
  I found.</font></p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/sardi1.JPG" width="550" height="389"></p>
<p><b>Pertussis (whooping cough), U.S. 2001</b></font></p>
<p>Days earlier, I had happened to see a map that 
  looked similar, displaying the geographical &#147;hot spots&#148; for tuberculosis. 
  Here is that map.</font></p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/sardi2.JPG" width="571" height="396"></p>
<p>Both maps display concentrations of disease in 
  southern border states, other east coast ports of entry, and selected other 
  areas. There isn&rsquo;t an environmental factor, such as stronger solar ultraviolet 
  radiation, or water, or lifestyle that can explain these geographical similarities. 
  Another map, involving geographical concentrations of Hepatitis A cases, also 
  looks surprisingly similar. Here is that map for your viewing.</font></p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/sardi3.JPG" width="400" height="400"></p>
<p><b>Reported cases, Hepatitis A, year 2000, CDC</b></font></p>
<p>Since these maps had such similar findings, I 
  was curious and dug up another map, displaying the concentrations of undocumented 
  immigrants to the USA. Here is that map.</font></p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/sardi4.JPG" width="405" height="400"></p>
<p>Mulling over these maps, I wondered, is there 
  a crime map of the U.S.? Here is the map I found.</font></p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/10/sardi5.JPG" width="550" height="414"></p>
<p>Disease and crime are concentrated in areas where 
  undocumented immigrants are more commonly found. An estimated 7 million undocumented 
  immigrants now reside in the U.S. While the nation wastes its money and energy 
  planning to thwart or combat imagined terrorism via the Department of Homeland 
  Security, carriers of biological and other threats walk over the southern border 
  into the U.S. on a daily basis. Over 1 million Mexicans will attempt entry this 
  year. It&rsquo;s an invasion.</font></p>
<p>Recently an outbreak of hepatitis traced to a 
  Mexican restaurant in Pennsylvania was inexplicably traced to contaminated green 
  onions, not the most obvious cause, undocumented food workers who harbored hepatitis. 
  For the most part, hepatitis is a blood-borne, not a food-borne disease. The 
  hepatitis outbreak infected over 650 individuals, caused 9000 Americans to undergo 
  immune globulin shots, and killed 4 people. If Americans found out restaurants 
  can commonly infect their customers from food workers, it would be a blow to 
  the restaurant industry. Better blame the green onions. Let&rsquo;s concede the 
  onions, grown in Mexico, were contaminated from fecal material. Did all the 
  green onions imported from Mexico end up in one single restaurant? There were 
  no other outbreaks of hepatitis elsewhere from green onions. There were 13 restaurant 
  workers who had hepatitis. They were the likely source of the transmitted infection. 
  </font></p>
<p>While the unions resist mandatory hepatitis vaccination 
  for food workers, the government mandates that newborn babies be jabbed with 
  hepatitis vaccines before they can leave the hospital. The logic in this defies 
  understanding until one realizes that newborn babies of immigrant families can 
  more easily acquire hepatitis. So all the rest of American babies are given 
  the vaccines. </font></p>
<p>The problem is with immigrant families who are 
  not properly screened for disease as they enter the U.S. A recent study conducted 
  by the Centers for Disease Control reveals that young infants from Hispanic 
  families are at the greatest risk for whooping cough, presumably because the 
  disease is transmitted from their unvaccinated family members who may have immigrated 
  to the US from Mexico where vaccination rates are low. [<i>Pediatric Infectious 
  Diseases Journal</i> 22: 628&mdash;34, 2003] </font></p>
<p>One can understand why Mexican people come to 
  the U.S. In Mexico they are only paid $5.00 per day for their labor. When wages 
  for Mexican workers rise, the peso is conveniently devalued to keep Mexico competitive 
  with foreign countries like China and Thailand. The owners of Mexican businesses 
  often keep their money in dollars in American banks and escape the devaluation 
  of their currency. So the common people are forever doomed to poverty. America 
  is their only hope. An article in the San Francisco Chronicle states that Mexicans 
  living in the U.S. send between $6 and $8 billion back to their families every 
  year, making them the third-biggest legitimate force in the Mexican economy 
  after oil and tourism. In essence, it&rsquo;s an unofficial form of foreign aid. 
  Mexico isn&rsquo;t about to control its borders, since Mexicans fleeing their 
  country for work in the U.S. send plenty of money back to their own country. 
  </font></p>
<p>The U.S. won&rsquo;t lower crime or disease rates 
  by putting more cops on the street or doctors in practice. How all this gets 
  resolved is beyond me. But I think Americans should carefully examine the situation 
  and confront politicians who up till now haven&rsquo;t had the resolve to remedy 
  the problem.</font></p>
