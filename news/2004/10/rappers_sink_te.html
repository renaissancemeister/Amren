<h1>Rappers Sink Teeth Into &lsquo;Shark Tale&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Braxton, Chicago Tribune, Oct. 5</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ludacris is easily one of hip-hop&rsquo;s raunchiest artists. He&rsquo;s made millions with his rapid-fire raps about his favorite subject &mdash; sex &mdash; and earned a fair share of &ldquo;Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics&rdquo; stickers with such R-rated lyrics as, &ldquo;I want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not exactly the kind of artist you&rsquo;d expect to see featured in the PG-rated &ldquo;Shark Tale,&rdquo; the new animated feature from DreamWorks that opened last Friday and features an A-list cast topped by Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Renee Zellweger.</p>
<p>In addition to Ludacris, the soundtrack to &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; features Eminem&rsquo;s foul-mouthed proteges, <span class="caps">D12.</span> Although hip-hop has long gained crossover status, its high-profile use in a family film represents the biggest splash yet in the effort to channel rap&rsquo;s coarser elements into the cultural mainstream.</p>
<p>Ludacris insists that cleaning up his act for &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; is not watering down hip-hop&rsquo;s edginess. The rapper said the opportunity to alter his racy style into child-friendly fare is actually in keeping with hip-hop&rsquo;s creative spirit.</p>
<p>No cursing</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t really a challenge at all,&rdquo; said Ludacris, who contributed &ldquo;Gold Digger,&rdquo; the theme song for a femme fatale fish, seductively voiced by Angelina Jolie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very multifaceted. All I had to do was make a song without cursing. And it&rsquo;s still staying true to my audience because I&rsquo;m branching out, reinventing myself. I don&rsquo;t have to do the same thing all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; floats its story about fish living and playing in a true sub-urban community &mdash; think New York City, underwater &mdash; and could be easily subtitled &ldquo;Fishz N Da Sea.&rdquo; Smith is the voice of Oscar, a little fish who works the less-than-pleasant tongue duty at the local Whale Wash. Zellweger is Angel, an angelfish with a huge crush on the clueless Oscar. De Niro spoofs his many gangster roles as Don Lino, a great white shark who rules the reef with his mob crew. Other voices include Jack Black and Michael Imperioli of &ldquo;The Sopranos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plot revolves around Oscar, who gets caught between a fin and a hard place when he tells a lie in an effort to gain respect from his fellow fishes. By the end of the film, he has learned a valuable lesson about honesty, life and love, while promoting unity among the fishes.</p>
<p>A validation of hip-hop</p>
<p>Several rap experts have already hailed &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; both as a validation of hip-hop culture as well as a welcome shift from the celebration of more high-profile aspects of a universe that focuses on profanity, the mistreatment of women and material wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just further proof that, 25 years after &lsquo;Rapper&rsquo;s Delight&rsquo; by the Sugar Hill Gang, hip-hop culture has become American culture,&rdquo; said Kevin Powell, a hip-hop historian who appears frequently on cable channel <span class="caps">VH1. </span>&ldquo;What was once seen as just a trend has now become part of the American fabric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; in a hip-hop vein was a part of the film&rsquo;s development from its inception three years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hip-hop is now a part of our culture and our world and clothing and our music, and I felt it presented an amazing opportunity to show that,&rdquo; said DreamWorks honcho and &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p>
<p>Crucial to establishing the film&rsquo;s hip credibility was Smith, who has evolved from his beginnings as a rapper to become one of Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest box-office stars.</p>
<p>Said Katzenberg: &ldquo;He was also instrumental in convincing many of the artists that this would be a hip and a cool movie to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wanting to establish authenticity and credibility, the film&rsquo;s music supervisors, Darren Higman and Laura Wasserman, said they contacted several harder-edged rap artists about contributing to the soundtrack.</p>
<p><span class="caps">D12, </span>which usually raps about drugs and &ldquo;ho&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was particularly pleased to be involved, Higman said. &ldquo;They were really into it, saying, &lsquo;Wow, we&rsquo;ve never done anything like this before.&rsquo; A lot of these artists may be harder edged in their careers, but they are also pop artists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thug life to hug life</p>
<p>Several hard-core rap performers who have laced their music with profanity and violent images are turning from the thug life to the hug life, embracing new projects that do not require a parental advisory warning.</p>
<p>Snoop Dogg, a rapper made infamous for his criminal past, brazen drug use and line of X-rated videos, is now a commercial pitchman for major products, a movie star (&ldquo;Starsky and Hutch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Soul Plane&rdquo;) and a talk-show favorite (&ldquo;The View&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Ice Cube, who is behind such violence-laden recordings as &ldquo;AmeriKKKa&rsquo;s Most Wanted,&rdquo; is the star and producer of the popular PG-rated &ldquo;Barbershop&rdquo; franchise.</p>
<p>Method Man &amp; Redman of the hard-core group Wu-Tang Clan, and Eve and Missy Elliott have already starred in current or upcoming network prime-time comedy and unscripted shows.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;il Romeo will start his second season as the star of Nickelodeon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Romeo!&rdquo; which is the network&rsquo;s most popular series among African-American children. His father, Master P, who created a gangsta rap empire with his independent No Limit label, co-stars and is an executive producer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dance 360,&rdquo; a new syndicated show from Paramount Domestic Television aimed at the after-school crowd, pits teens against each other in hip-hop dance battles. The show is co-hosted by Fredo Starr, formerly of the group Onyx, which developed a more punk-rock approach to rap.</p>
<p>Eminem scored as an actor in his semiautobiographical film &ldquo;8 Mile,&rdquo; which also earned him an Oscar for best song. And rapper 50 Cent was recently signed to an autobiographic film about his life in and out of prison. It will be scripted by Terence Winter, who just won an Emmy for outstanding drama writing for &ldquo;The Sopranos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo; may represent the most expensive and high-profile animated project to have a hip-hop setting, it is not the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PJs,&rdquo; a TV series that aired from 1999 to 2001 and featured the voice of Eddie Murphy, was set in a housing project. And in 1992, Paramount Pictures released &ldquo;Bebe&rsquo;s Kids,&rdquo; an animated comedy about rowdy children. The movie was written by Reginald Hudlin, who broke ground with the first hip-hop teen comedy, 1990&rsquo;s &ldquo;House Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toning it down</p>
<p>Despite the film&rsquo;s urban bent, DreamWorks is not promoting that aspect heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always nervous about shining a spotlight on the film,&rdquo; said the studio&rsquo;s head of marketing, Terry Press. &ldquo;People can react negatively. We never focused on Antonio Banderas being a Latino character in &lsquo;Shrek 2,&rsquo; but that audience knew he was in it. And Latino theaters were the highest-grossing theaters that opening weekend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poet and activist Tonya Maria Matthews said she was proud that DreamWorks was embracing the hip-hop culture with &ldquo;Shark Tale&rdquo;: &ldquo;The folks who helped form the culture should be really ecstatic that it has become universally accepted. Now it&rsquo;s up to us to make sure that people use it right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In case you were unfamiliar with <span class="caps">D12, </span>here are the vile lyrics to one of its popular &ldquo;songs&rdquo; with Eminem. Please excuse their profanity. (Apparently, Dream Works has.)</p>

You got it like I got it or not?<br>

When your tongue&rsquo;s rottin out from cotton-mouth<br>
When you end up becomin so dependent on weed<br>
That you end up spendin a g in the vendin machine<br>
You got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie<br>
Potato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat<br>
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja<br>
That&rsquo;s it gotcha thinkin the whole world is watchin ya<br>
Or maybe you don&rsquo;t smoke, maybe you just roll<br>
But whatever your drug&rsquo;s yo, go for the gusto<br>
Just don&rsquo;t, come fuck with me when I&rsquo;m doin my drugs<br>

And don&rsquo;t worry bout what I put in your drink<br>

But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo&rsquo; last beer (f&rsquo;real)<br>
Get the fuck off my dick and tell yo&rsquo; bitch to bring here ass here<br>
I kick a hoe out without givin her cabfare<br>

When I&rsquo;m out eatin, you fags&rsquo;ll interfere<br>
They don&rsquo;t go until I let &lsquo;em know a mag&rsquo; is sittin here<br>
