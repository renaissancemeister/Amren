<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Many politicians are hedging their bets by insisting that a positive reccommdation by the European Commission does not automatically mean Turkey will actually be allowed to join. But procrastination is not everyone&rsquo;s style: &ldquo;Turkey in the EU &mdash; never!&rdquo; says Dutch MP Geert Wilders, the new right-wing messiah of Dutch politics. Abi Daruvalla reports.<br/>
 <br/>
&ldquo;Turkey is an Islamic country and as such doesn&rsquo;t belong in the EU. I&rsquo;d sooner let Australia or Canada join,&rdquo; says Wilders who was thrown out of the Liberal VVD party (part of the coalition government) last month because of his vociferous refusal to toe the party line on Turkey&rsquo;s admission to EU. <br/>
 <br/>
Undaunted and unrepentant, Wilders immediately formed the one-man faction &lsquo;Groep Wilders&rsquo;, but a poll on 14 September indicated he would win 12 seats if an election was held now. According to a recent NIPO poll, 41% of the Dutch population are against Turkey&rsquo;s membership and 21% for (with another 30% are neutral). </p>
<p>Wilders has also received his fair share of negative reactions. The latest is an unconvincing death threat in the form of a poster on an internet site. The text reads &ldquo;no vote for this racist.&rdquo; and &ldquo;six bullets will kill him&rdquo;. It was supposedly put on an internet site by the unlikely sounding &ldquo;International Stalinists&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The Dutch government, currently EU president, has been extremely low profile on the issue of Turkey&rsquo;s admission to the EU. A spokesman said the Netherlands will support negotiations if Turkey has met the so-called Copenhagen Criteria (a set of conditions on issues such as an improvement in human rights, legal and economic reforms). </p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; main objection to Turkey&rsquo;s EU membership is a fear that such a move will increase the number of Turkish immigrants into Europe, and especially to the Netherlands where Turks make up the country&rsquo;s biggest immigrant group (352,000 in a total population of 16 million). </p>
<p>Wilders: &ldquo;The flow [of Turks] is already too big. Some 30,000 non-Western people come into the Netherlands every year on the basis of marriage and family unification alone! I want to forbid this for the coming five years. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a big problem with the integration of immigrants already in Holland. They top the list in terms of criminality, unemployment, welfare payments, domestic violence… these are just objective facts.&rdquo; And the situation will not, said Wilders, be helped if Turkey is allowed to join the EU. &ldquo;Let us concentrate on solving the problems with the immigrants already here properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His second objection is that Turkey&rsquo;s membership would cost the Dutch tax-payer&rdquo; even more money. Netherlands is already one of the EU&rsquo;s highest contributors and according to Fischer Turkey&rsquo;s membership would cost 11 billion euros in agricultural subsidies alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; third objection is that allowing Turkey to join would set a precedent for other non-Western countries to become members: &ldquo;Before we know, we will have an Islamic EU. I don&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is also concerned that Turkey will be the EU&rsquo;s biggest member in terms of national population in 10-20 years time and as such (under the new EU constitution) it will have a major voice in forming new legislation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Turkey to influence legislation in Europe, let alone in the Netherlands&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wilders dismisses the idea that Turkey could create a bridge between two cultures, saying that it has no influence and &ldquo;bad relations&rdquo; with its Islamic neighbours. </p>
<p>Wilders is unashamedly anti-Islam. Murdered populist Like Pim Fortuyn &mdash; a man he is often compared with &mdash; he describes Muslims as backward in terms of their political culture. Muslims, he says, must adhere to Western norms and values because these come from a &ldquo;higher, better, nicer and more human civilization.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Although most Dutch politicians have adopted a low-key stance on Turkish membership to the EU, they are not against Turkish membership in principle. There is some discomfort in Wilders&rsquo; own former VVD party but this has been subdued by the party calling a referendum in 2016 before a final decision is made on allowing Turkey to join the EU. </p>
<p>But Wilders is not, of course, alone in his opposition. Other, far more powerful political figures have spoken out against Turkish membership of the EU including French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Jacques Delors and Helmut Schmidt. </p>
<p>The European Commission is tipped to support opening negotiations in a report on Wednesday and EU ministers are expected to make the final decision on whether to start negotiations on Turkish membership at their summit in Brussels on 17 December.</p>
