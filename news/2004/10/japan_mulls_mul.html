<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3708098.stm">Japan Mulls Multicultural Dawn</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Oct. 5</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>In the third of a special series on Japan, 
  BBC News Online&rsquo;s Sarah Buckley reports on how an ageing population is 
  forcing people to reconsider attitudes to immigration. </b></p>
<p>The name Sony summons visions of all things Japanese. 
  Yet its chairman, Iwao Nakatani, recently called for mass immigration, opening 
  Japan to different faces and influences. </p>
<p>Mr Nakatani is worried because Japanese are living 
  longer, yet having fewer children. The result is a shrinking workforce which 
  threatens economic growth. </p>
<p>In recognition, the government is thinking of 
  loosening its restrictive immigration policy. </p>
<p>But any changes may come as a shock to a nation 
  where registered foreigners make up just over 1% of its population. </p>
<p>Yoko Nakamura, a 52-year-old woman in Tokyo, said 
  that living in Europe and Australia had shown her the advantages of Japan&rsquo;s 
  uniformity. </p>
<p>&#147;Everyone has the same hair colour and the 
  same eye colour. You feel maybe the guy next to you is feeling the same way, 
  so it&rsquo;s a good feeling to be homogenous,&#148; she said. </p>
<p>It is difficult to know how common this attitude 
  is. Of those interviewed on the streets of Tokyo, as many were enthusiastic 
  as alarmed about an influx of foreign workers. </p>

            <p>UK: 3.6% of population </p>
            <p>Germany: 9.1% of population </p>

<p>For many foreigners living in Japan, however, 
  discrimination is a real problem. Treatment appears to be determined by a range 
  of factors&mdash;from socio-economic status to ethnic background. </p>
<p>Gemba, a Senegalese who works in a topless bar 
  in the red-light district of Kabukicho, said: &#147;Every day, I feel discriminated 
  against. Japanese people don&rsquo;t like foreigners. </p>
<p>&#147;If you are inside a train, the Japanese 
  will not sit close to the foreigners.&#148; </p>
<p>He said he had overheard people talking about 
  him in Japanese as though he were stupid. </p>
<p>But the situation is complex, affected by factors 
  like profession, income and appearance. </p>
<p>Aarthi Muniswamy, an Indian IT worker from Chiba 
  prefecture, said her nationality carried positive associations in Japan. </p>
<p>&#147;In some parts of Japan they think people 
  from India are very brainy,&#148; she said. </p>
<p><b>Regional tensions </b></p>
<p>Faced with calls to relax immigration restrictions, 
  the government has shown some flexibility. The immigration bureau is in talks 
  with the Philippines about accepting Filipino care workers&mdash;badly needed 
  to help look after Japan&rsquo;s elderly. </p>
<p>The difficulty, however, comes when considering 
  unskilled labourers, who are currently not allowed to work in Japan. </p>
<p>And they are just the kind of people Japan needs 
  most as its population ages, according to Tony Laszlo, director of an anti-discrimination 
  organisation in Tokyo. </p>
<p>&#147;In 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, you have 
  to ask yourself who is going to be finding the holes in the tunnel and patching 
  them up so people don&rsquo;t die, who is going to be climbing the buildings 
  to wash the windows, who is going to be building bridges and fixing bridges, 
  and the answer is you don&rsquo;t have these people,&#148; he said. </p>
<p>Illegal labour could take up some of the slack. 
  Japanese authorities say there are 250,000 illegal immigrants, the majority 
  of whom entered the country on a temporary visa and over-stayed. Many of these 
  people are thought to work as unskilled labourers. </p>
<p>But the government wants to halve that number 
  in the next five years, and it does not appear ready to legalise unskilled foreign 
  workers. </p>
<p>Isao Negishi, assistant director to Japan&rsquo;s 
  immigration policy planner, argued that doing so would threaten Japanese people&rsquo;s 
  jobs in sectors like construction&mdash;an industry where work is currently scarce. 
  </p>
<p>As the population continues to age, however, economic 
  arguments against bringing in unskilled labour will weaken. Emotional arguments, 
  though, will stand. </p>
<p>It is likely that any unskilled workers will come 
  from countries which are geographically close&mdash;namely China and Korea. And 
  of Japan&rsquo;s neighbours, it is these countries who still hold the strongest 
  grudge against Japan&rsquo;s wartime behaviour. </p>
<p>Mr Laszlo said that relations with Korea had improved 
  markedly over the last two or three years. The 2002 World Cup, which Japan and 
  South Korea jointly hosted, helped ties, and there has been a recent upsurge 
  in interest in South Korean culture. </p>
<p>China, though, continues to have delicate relations 
  with Japan. The outrage sparked by a Japanese orgy in China last December, and 
  the riots following Japan&rsquo;s victory over China in the Asian Cup earlier 
  this year, have scratched wartime era wounds. </p>
<p>Hideko Yamamota, a 48-year-old Chinese woman born 
  in Japan, said she had suffered discrimination. </p>
<p>&#147;One of my teachers said: &lsquo;Why should 
  I help a Chinese person get a job?&rsquo; I was very upset. If there&rsquo;s crime 
  and you are there, then you are questioned by police.&#148; </p>
<p>In light of such testimony, Japan&rsquo;s government 
  faces a difficult choice between relaxing its immigration policy and possibly 
  upsetting social stability, or jeopardising the country&rsquo;s long-term economic 
  success. </p>
