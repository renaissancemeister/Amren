<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The UN has asked for access to migrants landing illegally in Italy as Rome presses ahead with the mass expulsions by air that began at the weekend. </p>
<p>The UN&rsquo;s refugee agency said it wanted to ensure genuine refugees were not expelled along with illegal migrants arriving by sea from North Africa. </p>
<p>Italy has sent at least 11 planeloads of migrants to Libya since Friday, in a dramatic change of policy. </p>
<p>It acted after more than 600 arrived on the island of Lampedusa in one night. </p>
<p>Up to 600 people are known to have been deported and the tough policy has caused mounting concern among humanitarian agencies. </p>
<p>The plight of desperate illegal migrants who are often put to sea in old boats by human traffickers was highlighted by news that a ship had sunk off Tunisia on Sunday, with the confirmed loss of 22 lives. </p>
<p>On Monday, an Italian warship intercepted a wooden boat crammed with some 150 people in international waters off Lampedusa and summoned the Tunisian navy to escort it back to the North African coast. </p>
<p>Others were spotted heading from Libya to Lampedusa in a rubber dinghy, according to an Italian coastguard quoted by the Associated Press news agency. </p>
<p>Demand for access </p>
<p>Raymond Hall, director of the UN refugee agency&rsquo;s (UNHCR) Regional Bureau for Europe, said all asylum-seekers &ldquo;should have access to a fair procedure&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;UNHCR should have access to them and we stand ready to assist Italian authorities in ensuring that those who do need protection get it,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>He added that the agency appreciated the &ldquo;very strong pressures&rdquo; on Italy. </p>
<p>His comments joined a chorus of criticism of the Italian policy. </p>
<p>Stefano Savi, director of Doctors Without Borders in Italy, said Italy had a humanitarian duty to potential refugees. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the men and women who head to Italy are making dangerous trips to flee war and persecution,&rdquo; he said, in a statement issued jointly with Amnesty International. </p>
<p>The African Union condemned the expulsions, complaining that immigrants&rsquo; human rights were &ldquo;less and less observed by authorities of host countries&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Libya is not a signatory to the UN&rsquo;s Geneva Convention on refugees and has been accused of abusing the rights of migrants. </p>
<p>However, Italian officials quoted by AFP news agency said they were allowing arrivals from Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia access to the asylum process, while those from other countries were being expelled. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Assault on Italy&rsquo; </p>
<p>Italian Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu spoke of an &ldquo;assault on the Italian coast &hellip;  by criminal gangs who ruthlessly cash in on illegal immigration&rdquo;. </p>
<p>In an abrupt change of policy, the Italian government decided at the weekend to start sending migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East back to Libya by plane. </p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s interior ministry undersecretary Alfredo Mantovano told the La Stampa newspaper on Monday that sending migrants back was a method the country would use &ldquo;increasingly&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If they know they will be sent back, maybe they won&rsquo;t set off?&rdquo; he said in La Stampa newspaper. </p>
<p>At least three flights reportedly took off on Monday. </p>
<p>The island is the nearest geographical point of arrival in the European Union from north Africa. </p>
<p>Back to Libya </p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Rana Jawad reports from Tripoli that the migrants will be held in detention centres before being flown back to their country of origin. </p>
<p>The Tunisian navy rescued 11 people from the boat which sank on Sunday &mdash; only an hour after setting off for Italy carrying would-be migrants from Morocco and Tunisia. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour after they left, the boat split under the weight of the passengers and broke in two, throwing everybody into the sea,&rdquo; said one witness. </p>
<p>As of Monday, 42 people were still missing, believed drowned. </p>
<p>Navies from European Union countries are due to start patrolling international waters around Lampedusa this week, in an attempt to deter people trafficking.</p>
