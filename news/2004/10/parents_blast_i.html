<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A member of the African-American Parents Association, a Toledo Public Schools watchdog group, last night reiterated her call that a long-standing program that evaluates new teachers be abolished. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is taking up money that could very well be spent elsewhere,&rdquo; said Twila Page, secretary of the group and a frequent school district critic. &ldquo;It has no redeeming value, and it can be terminated at any time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Urban Coalition, a network of district watchdog groups that includes the African-American Parents Association, called for eliminating the program in its campaigns against the district&rsquo;s tax levies last year. Ms. Page addressed the Toledo Board of Education at its meeting last night. </p>
<p>The intern program has received national acclaim but was criticized locally. </p>
<p>Gloria Sturdivant, a teacher not hired after participating in the plan, sued the district, seeking another hearing on her employment. In reversing a lower-court ruling, Ohio&rsquo;s 6th District Court of Appeals ruled in June she should have a court hearing. The hearing is scheduled for November. </p>
<p>Her husband, Tyrone Sturdivant, also asked that the program be terminated. </p>
<p>The program, dubbed The Toledo Plan, assigns an experienced teacher to new teachers in the district. After a number of classroom visits and evaluations, the veteran teacher makes a recommendation on whether the new teacher should be hired to the intern board of review, which is made up of five teachers and four administrators. </p>
<p>Ms. Page claims the program has a history of eliminating minority teachers. </p>
<p>David Welch, school board president, said that isn&rsquo;t true. &ldquo;My belief is that there is no racial bias with the termination of teachers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Superintendant Eugene Sanders said the program should not be ended. &ldquo;We are looking at the pros and the cons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are some who think its time has passed. Personally, I think it has merit.&rdquo; </p>
<p>An outside evaluation of the program is planned. It was not completed by the beginning of the school year, as the school board and administration had wanted.</p>
