Despite the blizzard of indignant reviews it has provoked, <i>The Bell Curve</i>
is largely devoted to proving something that virtually all Americans once
knew, and that many who have not had the sense knocked out of them by a
college education still know: A person&rsquo;s intelligence is pretty well set
at birth, and is likely to make a huge difference in how he turns out.
Liberals pretend not to believe this, and since they set the intellectual
tone for the country, the book has caused a scandal. Let the scandal continue.
It has already pushed sales past three hundred thousand, and some of the
people who buy this book will actually read it. They will find that it
demolishes the assumptions behind nearly every social policy of the last
three decades.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The NLSY</font></b>
<p>At the heart of the book is an extensive analysis of something called
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). This is a huge study,
begun in 1979, of more than 12,000 American young people who were carefully
chosen to be representative of the nation as a whole. The survey seems
to have been conceived according to the classic, liberal conviction that
a person&rsquo;s family or school background <i>causes</i> social pathology;
the study was meant to gather information to prove it. Like almost all
contemporary social research, the NLSY ignored intelligence as a possible
causal factor.
<p>IQ scores for NLSY participants were collected by pure coincidence.
The U.S. Army needed to update the norms for the Armed Forces Qualification
Test (AFQT), and rather than go to the bother of finding another nationally
representative sample, it simply gave the test to the NLSY participants.
Since the AFQT is the equivalent of an IQ test, the NLSY suddenly and <i>accidentally</i>
made it possible to show whether intelligence – independently of family
background – predicts success or failure in life.
<p>As the authors of <i>The Bell Curve</i> point out in relentless detail,
intelligence is the crucial variable. The graph on this page is only one
of many from the book that make this point dramatically. The steep curve
shows the effect IQ differences have on the likelihood of otherwise average
members of the NLSY sample being poor – average in both age and parents&rsquo;
socio-economic status (SES). The gentler curve shows the effect of parents&rsquo;
SES on the likelihood of people of average intelligence being poor.
<p>This graph shows that people with average IQs had about an eleven percent
chance of being poor if their parents were from the very bottom of the
social scale. But for people with similarly average intelligence, having
the most upscale parents possible reduced their chances of being poor by
only about half – to five percent.&nbsp;
<center><img src="/news/2004/10/graf.gif" height="353" width="385"></center>
<p>Intelligence was vastly more important than parents&rsquo; SES. Among people
who had entirely average family backgrounds, the least intelligent had
about a 26 percent chance of being poor, whereas the most intelligent had
perhaps a two percent chance of being poor. IQ – for people who came from
average families – made a <i>13-fold difference</i> in the likelihood of
being poor. Family background – for people with average IQs – made only
a two-fold difference. In similar manner, <i>The Bell Curve</i> demonstrates
that low intelligence is by far the most important predictor for most of
the other things the country is presumably worried about: crime, welfare,
illegitimacy, unemployment, etc.
<p>The difference IQ makes can be expressed in other ways. For example,
82 percent of the poor people in the NLSY sample have below-average IQs,
as do 90 percent of the chronic welfare recipients. Ninety-five percent
of the children living in poverty have mothers with below-average IQs.
Low-IQ parents also tend to be bad parents; child abuse and neglect are
overwhelmingly concentrated among the poor and unintelligent.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Data like these are tremendously important. Conventional liberalism
has always taken it for granted that schools or childhood environment rather
than native intelligence makes people succeed or fail. This is why liberalism
has exhausted itself trying to &#8220;enrich&#8221; the households of the poor and
beat a high-school education into boneheads. <i>The Bell Curve</i> shows
that the entire uplift movement has willfully ignored the variable that
matters most: IQ. Fiddling with Head Start and school lunches is largely
a waste of time if it does not raise intelligence.
<p>As the authors suggest, liberals actually know this. That is why, despite
their hostility towards IQ, they trumpet the news whenever they think they
have found a way to raise it. <i>The Bell Curve</i> carefully sifts through
the data to show that not even the most intensive versions of Head Start
have an enduring effect on intelligence or on school performance, despite
extravagant claims by their boosters. As the book explains, this is not
only because intelligence is largely hereditary, but because researchers
cannot figure out what actually affects the part of it that is theoretically
subject to environmental manipulation. IQ can be <i>lowered</i> through
severe malnutrition or sensory deprivation, but within a very broad range
of ordinary human environments, little can be done to <i>raise</i> it.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Racial Differences</font></b>
<p>As if all this were not bad enough, the authors also discuss race and
IQ. Although this part of the book has received the most attention, it
is nothing more than a summary of familiar data. Far more interesting is
how Messrs. Herrnstein and Murray use the racial data from the NSLY. It
is well known that blacks and Hispanics have lower average IQs than whites
and that, as groups, their behavior bears the stigmata of lower intelligence.
But what do we find when we compare people of different races who have
the <i>same</i> IQ scores? The results are edifying.
<p>For example, although whites are two and a half times more likely than
blacks to graduate from college, blacks with a typical college-graduate
IQ (114) are 36 percent <i>more likely</i> than whites of the same IQ to
graduate from college. Likewise, although NLSY whites are 67 percent more
likely than blacks to be in what <i>The Bell Curve</i> calls &#8220;high-IQ jobs,&#8221;
blacks with the requisite IQ (117) are 2.6 times more likely than whites
of
the same IQ to hold such jobs. This would appear to be clear evidence that
blacks benefit from racial preferences.
<p>Despite these preferences, controlling for IQ does <i>not</i> make the
undesirable differences in racial behavior go away. The likelihood of various
forms of failure among nonwhites can be expressed as a multiple of the
white likelihood for the same behavior. For example, blacks in the NLSY
sample are 3.7 times more likely than whites to be poor, and Hispanics
are 2.6 times more likely. What about a comparison only of those blacks,
whites, and Hispanics with the same IQ of 100? The multiples diminish,
but do not go away: Blacks&nbsp; –&nbsp; 1.8x, Hispanics&nbsp; –&nbsp;
1.5x. The chart below summarizes other similar findings.

<p>What do these data mean? Society at large – at least universities and
employers – appears to give nonwhites preferential treatment. Yet many
fail to take advantage of these preferences, and are more likely than whites
of the same IQs to be poor, go on welfare, or go to jail. When it comes
to having illegitimate children, restricting the comparison to groups with
the same IQs has virtually no effect: Hispanics and blacks are still twice
and five times more likely than whites to have children out of wedlock.
<p>Whatever causes these persistent differences between groups with the
same IQs probably explains why it is that when blacks and whites get the
same SAT scores, the whites are likely to get better grades in college.
To use the technical term, standardized tests &#8220;overpredict&#8221; black success.
The data on racial multiples for social failure can be viewed the same
way: IQ scores overpredict nonwhite law-abidingness, self-sufficiency,
likelihood of having a legitimate child, etc. In other words, even when
blacks and Hispanics are <i>as smart</i> as whites, they still do not <i>behave</i>
like whites. (It would be interesting to have comparable data for Asians.)
<p>Though <i>The Bell Curve</i> ducks the issue, this suggests that there
is more to racial differences than IQ. There may be differences in hormone
levels, willingness to defer gratification, self discipline, or any of
the other areas that Philippe Rushton has investigated [see <i>AR</i> of
Dec. 1994]. These would account for greater failure levels for nonwhites
compared to whites with the same intelligence.
<p>Liberals might argue that nonwhite deviance remains high even when IQ
is held constant, only because &#8220;racist&#8221; white society does not recognize
the abilities of nonwhites. Yet the data on employment and college graduation
suggest that &#8220;racist&#8221; white society <i>over</i>recognizes nonwhite ability.
<p>There is one more complicating piece to this puzzle: According to NLSY
data, whites and nonwhites of the same IQ are paid almost identical wages.
This suggests equal treatment by employers, and contradicts the earlier
suggestion that nonwhites enjoy racial preferences on the job. However,
if the races really do differ in the many ways that Prof. Rushton has found
– that is, not just in intelligence – and these differences make nonwhites
less desirable employees, paying them at the same rate for the same IQ
is a form of preference. At the very least, blacks are receiving equal
treatment, which belies the liberal argument that &#8220;racism&#8221; explains nonwhite
deviance.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Future Generations</font></b>
<p>Some of <i>The Bell Curve</i>&rsquo;s most important and provocative findings
are about dysgenics. The authors point out that dull people are having
more children than bright people. They are also having them at earlier
ages, so we are likely to have five large generations of dull people by
the time we have had four small generations of bright people.&nbsp;
<p>Since the children of NLSY women have been tested for intelligence,
we now know the extent to which low IQ is being passed on from one generation
to the next. For example, women in the bottom 20 percent of IQ (87 and
below) produced 72 percent of the children with IQs of 80 or below.
<p>The NLSY data also suggests that the racial gaps in intelligence are
widening. The black-white IQ gap for NLSY mothers is 13.2 points; the black-white
gap for their children is 17.5 points. Likewise, the Hispanic-white IQ
gap for mothers is 12.2, while the gap for children is 14.1. As the authors
point out, since these gaps are between <i>mothers</i> (not the whole NSLY
population) and their children, there is no obvious reason why they should
be growing wider.</p>

<p>It is likely that dysgenic trends are pushing America&rsquo;s average IQ down
by one or two points every generation. This may not seem like much, but
a small shift in the average makes a big difference. Messrs. Herrnstein
and Murray statistically manipulated the NLSY sample to see what effect
a three-point drop – or a three point rise – in average IQ would have on
levels of social failure. The above graph shows the results.
For example, lowering the average IQ by just three points increases the
high school dropout rate by 14 percent, while raising the average IQ by
the same amount reduces it by 30 percent.
<p>What appear to be insignificant shifts at the average could quickly
change the entire profile of our population and make it impossible to support
institutions we take for granted. The long-term consequences of differential
birth rates are an extremely serious matter, but one that American society
resolutely ignores.
<p>On the other hand, it is worth noting that <i>The Bell Curve</i> does
not assume an inevitable association between low IQ and social pathology.
It points out that the explosion of crime and illegitimacy in the 1960s
was so sudden it <i>cannot</i> have been caused by dysgenic drift. Before
that decade, people of low intelligence were coping with life better than
they did after it. The social forces that were loosed upon the country
– and the authors are candid about not entirely understanding them – hit
all Americans, but they hit people with low IQs hardest.

This review has touched on only a few of the subjects that <i>The Bell
Curve</i> covers in fascinating detail. For example, the book describes
how the demands of a modern economy are segregating smart people from the
rest of the population, both occupationally and residentially. It shows
that the best and easiest way for an employer to get a good work force
is to give job-seekers a 12-minute intelligence test. It discusses the
damaging effect of massive immigration from low-IQ, nonwhite countries.
It describes the tyrannical consequences of government attempts to force
equality upon unequal people. It includes an excellent summary of how affirmative
action <i>really</i> works, and it describes how schools lavish so much
attention on dimwits that gifted children are shortchanged. The book is
stuffed with hard data and good arguments.
<p>So where do we go from here? Most of the book&rsquo;s recommendations are
&#8220;controversial&#8221; but obvious: abolish affirmative action, restrict immigration,
end welfare, beef up programs for gifted children. One cannot expect these
authors to go any further than this.
<p>As for race, they seem to think it is nothing more than a statistical
artifact. They write that if the country stops counting by race and treats
people as individuals, &#8220;group differences can take their appropriately
insignificant place in affecting American life.&#8221; This naive view is perhaps
obligatory even for people who break other taboos, but it need not overly
trouble us. <i>The Bell Curve</i> is a great leap forward in the debate
