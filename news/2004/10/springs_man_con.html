<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A Colorado man studying for his master&rsquo;s degree at Harvard University was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to six to eight years in prison Thursday for stabbing a man to death in a fight in Cambridge, Mass. </p>
<p>Prosecutors had charged Alexander Pring-Wilson, 26, of Colorado Springs with murder in the slaying last year of Michael Colono, arguing that Pring-Wilson attacked the 18-year-old Colono for ridiculing him as he stumbled home drunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael Colono made fun of the defendant, and it cost him his life,&rdquo; prosecutor Adrienne Lynch said.</p>
<p>Pring-Wilson said he pulled a 4-inch folding knife and stabbed Colono in self-defense after Colono and his cousin brutally beat him.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated over five days before finding Pring-Wilson guilty of the lesser charge. Judge Regina Quinlan could have given him 20 years behind bars.</p>
<p>Ann Kaufman, who defended Pring-Wilson with co-counsel Rick Levinson, both from Colorado Springs, said she would appeal the case.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, attorneys are not allowed by law to contact jurors, so Kaufman said she was unclear how the jury reached its verdict. After finding Pring-Wilson not guilty of first-degree murder and second-degree murder, the jury settled on voluntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>Under Massachusetts law, a person can be found guilty of manslaughter if a jury believes excessive force was used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you couldn&rsquo;t lawfully defend yourself under these circumstances, self-defense is effectively dead as a defense in the United States,&rdquo; Kaufman said.</p>
<p>The attorney said that pervasive print and television coverage that dwelled on the different backgrounds of the two men &mdash; Pring-Wilson&rsquo;s status as a Harvard student and son of two lawyers versus the victim&rsquo;s history as a high school dropout who worked as a cook and earned his GED &mdash; tainted the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prosecutorial hype, the fantasy spin on the case, I think, fundamentally affected the fairness of the outcome,&rdquo; Kaufman said. &ldquo;And the painting of the victim as sort of a family guy instead of on probation for distribution of crack cocaine &mdash; it was fictionalized and sensationalized, and it was all a lie. And it worked very well for the prosecutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Simmons, who watched Pring- Wilson grow up in the house across the street, was pleased to hear that the jury had not convicted him of first-degree murder, which would have carried a sentence of life without parole.</p>
<p>However, he said, a sentence of six to eight years was &ldquo;too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pring-Wilson began serving his sentence Thursday.</p>
<p>He was at Harvard studying for his master&rsquo;s degree in Russian and Eurasian studies and planned to attend law school. Colono, a high school dropout, had earned his equivalency diploma and was working as a cook at a Boston hotel.</p>
<p>Pring-Wilson&rsquo;s mother, Cynthia Pring, said she understood the Colono family&rsquo;s pain. &ldquo;I feel for them so strongly,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son feels for them so strongly.&rdquo;</p>
