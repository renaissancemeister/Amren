<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CALDWELL, Idaho &mdash; Gunfire and gang violence are alarming people in this farm town where the usual background noise is the reassuring chug of field machinery. </p>
<p>Since July, police have received more than 100 reports of shots fired in Caldwell, a town of 30,000 halfway between Boise and the Oregon line. Two young men have been killed and several more wounded in drive-by shootings. Police believe most of the violence is gang-related. </p>
<p>Authorities are increasing patrols, and for the first time, neighborhood watches are springing up in Caldwell, a community that for decades has typified small-town conservatism and the farmland work ethic. Many are asking themselves how big-city gang problems reached their quiet corner of the West. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let my kids go outside,&rdquo; said Maria Salenes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore, I&rsquo;m so scared.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Gunfire has plagued Salenes&rsquo; neighborhood in the past, but the trouble came too close on Oct. 11 when the 37-year-old mother of four heard a midday thump on her door. When she opened it, a man she did not know fell into her living room, mortally wounded in a drive-by. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He was breathing real hard,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;He tried to tell me something, but it was his throat. He couldn&rsquo;t talk at all. I feel like nothing is safe.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Two men have been charged in the slaying of Sigmund Goode, 21. The shooting was the fourth in a week in the mostly Hispanic neighborhood of working-class homes and tree-lined streets where many people go home for lunch. It also follows the slaying of 22-year-old Carlos Chavez in August. No arrest has been made in that slaying. </p>
<p>For more than a century, Caldwell has been a hub for one of the most agriculturally productive counties in the nation. Hops, onions, potatoes, beans, sugar beets and hybrid sweet-corn are grown here. </p>
<p>Thanks to a booming state economy, Caldwell&rsquo;s population has jumped 16 percent in the past four years after growing 41 percent in the 1990s. The area has a long history of Hispanic farmworkers migrating here every year to work the summer crops. But since the 1990s, more and more of the families have been settling here. </p>
<p>Police said gang activity, involving both young Hispanics and whites, has grown with the population. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Poverty in some places is part of it, the lack of parental control, both parents working to keep their heads afloat,&rdquo; said Canyon County prosecutor Dave Young. </p>
<p>Police Capt. Chris Allgood said he has spent most of his 41 years in Caldwell and watched as the town slowly changed. &ldquo;Fifteen or 20 years ago, we used to have a homicide every three or four years, and now we have three or four every year,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>More than 150 people turned out for a recent community meeting at the Hispanic Cultural Center. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make it an area where my children can go outside and play in the yard and not worry about getting shot,&rdquo; said Jennifer Bennett, 33. &ldquo;We want to take back our neighborhood.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Police said their efforts have been hindered by witnesses and victims who are afraid to cooperate. </p>
<p>&ldquo;People in the neighborhoods are the key to solving these cases,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;By not stopping it, you&rsquo;re enabling it. The frustration&rsquo;s just not from them. It&rsquo;s both sides. We&rsquo;re frustrated, too.&rdquo;</p>
