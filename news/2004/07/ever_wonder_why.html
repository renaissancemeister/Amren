						<p><em>Thomas Sowell, townhall.com, Jul. 6</em></p>
<p>Ever wonder why people who hate America live in America? </p>
<p>At a soccer match between Mexico and the United States a few years ago, the stands were full of Mexican flags. The fans booed when &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; was played and those few fans who raised American flags were pelted with debris, as were the American soccer players.</p>
<p>This would have been rotten behavior if it had taken place in Mexico City. But it took place in Los Angeles. So it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>We already have enough grown America-haters in this country without importing any more, whether from Mexico or the Middle East. But neither political party has the guts to put a s to it. </p>
<p>Politicians will not even enforce our existing immigration laws, much less pass new ones. If they did, they would not only lose minority voting blocs, they would be so vilified in the media as to lose the votes of those mainstream Americans who take the media seriously.</p>
<p>Many of those in the media, and among the intelligentsia in general, see themselves as citizens of the world, and they see the United States as just the country that happens to be lucky enough to be graced by their presence.</p>
<p>To these elites, immigration is just one more issue on which to engage in moral preening and attribute nasty motives to ordinary Americans who disagree with them. From the way many discussions of immigration are conducted, you might never dream that we are talking about the permanent alteration of the American people and the American culture. </p>
<p>Even drug addiction is not so permanent, for some people can give it up and, if they can&rsquo;t, maybe their children can. But a woman can cross the border from Mexico to have a baby in Texas or California and that baby&rsquo;s descendants will be American citizens long after all of today&rsquo;s American citizens are dead and gone.</p>
<p>Most of the people who come here, legally or illegally, undoubtedly do so just to better themselves, as immigrants have done for centuries. But people who crossed an ocean to get here came here to become Americans, not to remain foreigners, much less to become America haters.</p>
<p>The difference today is that organized activists and a multicultural ideology that has become dogma among educators and the media combine to keep foreigners foreign in language, culture and allegiance. What happened at the Los Angeles soccer match is just one of many indications of how well they have succeeded.</p>
<p>None of this is peculiar to people from Mexico. There are people here from the Middle East who demand rights that they never had in their native countries, but who take on no corresponding obligation of loyalty to America. Instead, many teach hatred of those Americans who were born here who happen to be Jewish.</p>
<p>Our tolerance has led to importing intolerance.</p>
<p>American citizenship is no longer prized as it once was. Indeed, it is no longer necessary for living permanently in the United States. In California, illegal immigrants not only go to the state universities, they pay lower tuition than American students who are from other states.</p>
<p>Both legal and illegal immigrants who don&rsquo;t feel like bothering to learn the language used by the American people will have government agencies and private institutions alike provide them with information in their own languages.</p>
<p>The argument that immigrants &ldquo;take jobs that other Americans don&rsquo;t want&rdquo; leaves out the crucial factor of pay. If legal or illegal immigrants came here and worked as journalists or college professors at half the pay that American journalists or college professors receive, the intelligentsia would probably have no trouble seeing the fallacy in what they are saying.</p>
<p>One of the reasons many Americans will not take many low-paying or arduous jobs is that the welfare state makes it unnecessary for them to do so. But get those Americans off the gravy train, and take away employers&rsquo; supply of cheap foreign labor, and Americans would resume doing jobs that they did for centuries.</p>
<p>More important, we would no longer be importing so many people who don&rsquo;t want to be Americans.</p>
<h2 align="center"><h2 align="center">Comments from Readers</h2></h2> 
<p> <br>
From: Rich </p>
<p>Thomas Sowell makes me wonder if there is such a thing as a black man who recognises racial realities.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
 <br>
 <br>
From: John P. M.</p>
<p>To Rich,</p>
<p>If every black American (and many white ones, for that matter) were of Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s ability and candor, half of the battle would be over!</p>
<p>But alas, as he points out: &#8220;We already have enough grown America-haters without importing any more, whether from Mexico or the Middle East. But neither political party has the guts to put a s to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he ever runs for president, I would vote for him. God knows, we could do much worse, Hillary Clinton for example!</p>
<p>Best wishes, John PM.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: John Ruskin</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. The more non-assimilatable immigrants, the harder things will get for those already here who themselves have not assimilated all that well. The pie isn&rsquo;t getting bigger and there are more hands reaching for a slice. Mr. Sowell is more of a patriot than most of the members of our bought Congress, though. And the Demopublicans and Republicrats are actually competing to see who can legalize the most Mexican invaders. <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Rich </p>
<p>To John P.M.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree. Thomas Sowell is one of my favorite authors. What I was wondering (perhaps I should have been more clear) was whether Mr Sowell would be open to the concept of significant racial differences. He never crosses that line in his writings, but perhaps privately he would agree with our views if pressed. He&rsquo;s just too intelligent not to see the realities of race.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: John P. M.</p>
<p>To Rich,</p>
<p>I hope you did not view my comments as being critical, they were ment to be supportive/thouhgt provoking. Perhaps, I should have been more clear myself? To a point, I believe Mr. Sowell does admit to the realities of race. His 1994 book, &#8220;Race and Culture : A World View&#8221; does explore the issue to a point. In the end, I think we both can agree, he puts the white and black liberals to shame in the logic department.</p>
<p>Again, best wishes to you Rich.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Rich </p>
<p>I think he admits the realities of race but blames it on culture, not genetics. I can&rsquo;t remember which one it was, but I remember one of his columns on townhall.com specifically stating that genetics play no part in racial differences. This may not be a reflection of his true feelings though.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Belle Kerve </p>
<p>Re above, Sowell admits blacks have lower IQs. But he twists hinself into a pretzel of denial regarding the genetic question. As far as I can tell, it is deliberate lying. <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: John P. M.</p>
<p>To Rich and Belle Kerve,</p>
<p>I think you both make great points. I tend to look for the positive points, as best I can, in anything I read. I had read that 1994 book many years(9-10) ago, a friend &#8220;borrowed&#8221; it, so I do work from memory.</p>
<p>The issues of: culture, biology/genetics, and the individual (nature and nurture) all come into play. It is the question of how one adapts and how all three variables in question interact, that I think we all question here, and Mr Sowell was driving at. Each influences the other, thus the ability of an individual to thrive or fail in a given situation, country, era, etc. This is my general approach to racial realities, politics, psychology, and life in general.</p>
<p>That Mr. Sowell (a reformed black leftist liberationist) is trepidatious, about an outright racial explination of culture and history is understandable. If the reverse were true, we might also be. That he did explore it, as I noted &#8220;to a point&#8221; is refreshing.</p>
<p>I write this to be thought provoking and not combative. I stress, I think you both make great points,</p>
<p>Sincerely, John PM.<br>
