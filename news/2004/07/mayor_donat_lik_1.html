						<p><em>Ron Goldwyn, Philly.com, Jul. 13</em></p>
<p>AN UNREPENTENT Mayor Street wants to update the NAACP convention with some hot old news:</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, the brothers and sisters are still in charge.</p>
<p>Street, in welcoming remarks yesterday to the 8,000-delegate gathering at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, recalled how he &ldquo;got myself in trouble&rdquo; in 2002.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said in the city of Philadelphia the brothers and sisters are in charge,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;They never let me forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Street apologized at the time. But yesterday he brought delegates to their feet roaring approval when he said he &ldquo;will never apologize&rdquo; for the appointments and opportunities he has provided for African-Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should never be ashamed of supporting African-Americans,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Street said his advice to critics of his 2002 remarks was: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like the brothers and sisters being in charge, you should register Republican.&rdquo; He was overwhelmingly re-elected in 2003 with stronger white support than he received in 1999.</p>
<p>Street exhorted the delegates, &ldquo;I will never apologize for [appointing] a black chief of staff, a black police commissioner, a black fire commissioner &hellip; &rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to cite other city posts to which he has named minority officials. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t provide opportunity for African- Americans in this government, who will?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Street made no mention of the federal indictment of former administration officials and political supporters for alleged &ldquo;pay-for-play&rdquo; influence peddling tied to city contracts.</p>
<p>But he did say, &ldquo;We recognize responsible economic empowerment for African-Americans in this city.&rdquo; He said his administration makes sure &ldquo;minorities do business with the city of Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, Street said President Bush was guilty of &ldquo;bad politics&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad policy&rdquo; for refusing to address the convention. He said Bush seemed to be &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; by &ldquo;right-wing&rdquo; pressure groups to stay away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was a missed opportunity for the president [and] a slight on the NAACP.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, in a fiery address, said Bush&rsquo;s absence was a slight that would not be forgotten on Election Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be there in every polling place and every battleground state,&rdquo; Mfume said.</p>
<p>The NAACP, he said, will undertake a strategy aimed &ldquo;entirely at unlikely voters and early voters,&rdquo; meaning those who have skipped past elections and those who can&rsquo;t make it to the polls but are eligible to vote absentee.</p>
<p>Mfume didn&rsquo;t name names but accused Bush of recruiting &ldquo;ventriliquist&rsquo;s dummies&rdquo; from minority communities to sing his praises. Mfume said if Bush &ldquo;were willing to listen, he would hear our opinion of what it really means to be pro-family, why it&rsquo;s really important to save Social Security and why smaller classrooms for students and day care for working parents must be more than a song or dance or a 20-second sound bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The local welcomers included U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa.; Bishop Ernest Morris, president of the Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity; and Minister Rodney Muhammad, of the Nation of Islam.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should never be ashamed of supporting African-Americans,&#8221; [Mayor Street] said.</p>
<p>Street exhorted the delegates, &#8220;I will never apologize for [appointing] a black chief of staff, a black police commissioner, a black fire commissioner &hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that so few White people have the same level of racial consciousness as the Mayor of Philadelphia. To paraphrase Mayor Street:</p>
<p>WE should never be ashamed of supporting White Americans.</p>
<p>WE should never apologize for preferring to live, work with, and patronize White neighbors, White employees, and White businesses.</p>
<p>Philly, like Detroit, leads its state in everything that is undesirable: violent crime, drug abuse, venereal disease, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, and disfunctional schools. If rational people &#8220;don&rsquo;t like it&#8221; or him   &mdash;   they move, which is why Philly continues to lose population.<br>

<p>Obviously, I live in Philly. It is a dying city. Mismanagement and corruption in the John Street Administration are epidemic. A federal grand jury has just indicted a pack of Street&rsquo;s close political brother and sister cronies he has funneled goodies to in typical big city negro mayor croneyism. The press calls it a &#8220;pay to play&#8221; culture that predates Street. No doubt true. Philadelphia is a very corrupt city. The arrogance of this man, who is still not out of the woods with the federal prosecutor, to crow about his corrupt racial nepotism and cronyism.<br>

<p>Can&rsquo;t someone sue the City of Philadelphia for racial discrimination in it&rsquo;s hiring practices? If a white guy said the same thing, the Feds would be all over him for hiring discrimination. <br>

<p>&#8220;In Philadelphia, the bothers and sisters are still in charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep. There goes another American city well on its way to third world status.<br>

<p>Does this mean the Mayor of Philadelphia will also blame the &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; if things go wrong? And things will go wrong. <br>

From: spartacus</p>
<p>Something to brag about, right  &mdash;  the &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in charge of a city where corruption stinks and the streets don&rsquo;t get cleaned. Philly has always been politically corrupt but the city didn&rsquo;t lose population  &mdash;  white AND black, at the rate of 10000 a year. If a white had said EXACTLY the same thing, he could have planned instant retirement. Why should anyone &#8220;forget it&#8221;  &mdash;  would the racist NAACP forget the same thing said by a white. And who is &#8220;they&#8221; anyway? Certainly not the 97% of blacks who reelected Street or the whites who swept him into office. Philly is the next Detroit, or maybe it&rsquo;s there already. Looks that way to me. <br>
