<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

				<i>Lisa Myers, MSNBC.com, Jul. 13</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Among many federal agents along the U.S. border with Canada, Washington&rsquo;s warnings about the need for vigilance against another terror attack ring hollow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Border agents tell NBC News that since April, they&rsquo;ve been forced to release most illegal immigrants back onto American streets within hours of catching them&mdash;even some who are criminals or from countries known to produce terrorists.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#147;Shortly after 9/11, we were locking up everybody. There was no exception,&#148; says recently retired U.S. Border Agent Peter Kush. &#147;We seem to be going back to the same old, same old song and dance.&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				One Vermont sheriff says border patrol detainees in his jail have dropped 75 percent since April. &#147;I was told kind of unofficially by telephone that the monies had run out,&#148; says Franklin County Sheriff Robert Norris.
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, documents obtained by NBC News show that over the last month, illegal immigrants were repeatedly &#147;released due to lack of detention funds.&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the New York and Vermont borders alone, at least 11 released were from so-called countries of special interest, including Pakistan and Morocco. T.J. Bonner of the Border Patrol Agents Association, who represents border patrol agents nationwide, says, &#147;It&rsquo;s simply mind-numbing to the agents. We catch people who could possibly be terrorists and we&rsquo;re being told, &lsquo;Gee, we&rsquo;re out of money, we have to let them go.&rsquo;&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				Other documents obtained by NBC News reveal:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&mdash;<strong>York, Pa.: </strong>&#147;Due to worsening budget problems,&#148; this Pennsylvania detention facility no longer takes all criminal &hellip; aliens,&#148; generally only violent ones.
				</p>
				<p>
					&mdash;<strong>Miami</strong>: A memo re-titled &#147;Let &lsquo;em All Go&#148; by an unhappy agent, says &#147;due to budgetary constraints,&#148; only criminals who completed sentences after October 1998 must be detained.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				A land Security official says the agency is asking Congress for more money, but insists agents aren&rsquo;t releasing anyone who might be dangerous, whether a criminal or possible terrorist.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#147;We are not compromising national security,&#148; says Victor Cerda of the Department of land Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. &#147;Agents look at each case individually and they will make determinations, again, based on the intelligence that&rsquo;s out there. Is this person a threat to our country?&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				But agents say they only have a few hours for basic checks of terror watch lists and criminal records. They warn that without detentions and longer investigations, terrorists who use aliases or don&rsquo;t have criminal records could well be free.
