				NASHVILLE&mdash;A grassroots Republican group is denouncing what it calls the &#147;candidate of hate&#148; on the Aug. 5 GOP primary ballot for the 8th congressional district and is instead backing the new write-in candidacy of a traditional Republican.
			</p>
			<p>
				The views of James L. Hart of Buchanan, Tenn., the only Republican on the Aug. 5 ballot for the West Tennessee congressional seat, are controversial. His Web site (</font>www.jameshartforcongress.com</font>) focuses on his views on &#147;eugenics&#148; to cut birth rates among what he calls &#147;less favored races&#148; and increase births among &#147;more favored races.&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				Hart describes &#147;less favored races&#148; as &#147;the less favored races of sub-Saharan Africa, which Hollywood continues to call black.&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				Hart, 60, was the only candidate to enter the Republican primary for the West Tennessee congressional seat by the April 1 deadline. Without an opponent, he was set to win the nomination to take on eight-term U.S. Rep. John Tanner, a Democrat, in the November general election.
			</p>
			<p>
				But a financial analyst and former military officer, Dennis Bertrand of Newbern, Tenn., has announced a write-in candidacy for the Republican nomination, citing Hart&rsquo;s views as being against Republican principles.
			</p>
			<p>
				And he picked up the backing this week of TeamGOP, a statewide grassroots Republican organization. The group issued a press release Monday saying it &#147;denounces and repudiates&#148; Hart&rsquo;s candidacy.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#147;TeamGOP calls for all Republicans to unite against the politics of hate and endorse and support the candidacy of Dennis Bertand,&#148; it said.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of TeamGOP&rsquo;s three directors and founders, Jeff Ward of Tipton County, said Friday he issued the statement because, &#147;I&rsquo;m a Republican and I don&rsquo;t want to have people like that carrying our flag.&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				Hart, a real estate agent in Murray, Ky., acknowledged Friday that he did not expect to beat Tanner and that he&rsquo;s not surprised the Republicans oppose him. &#147;I just wanted to spread my ideas,&#148; he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				When he ran as an independent against Tanner in 2002, he polled only 4,288 votes, or 2.6 percent.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#147;I&rsquo;m not sure I would accept the word hate, but I think they have every right to oppose my campaign and to have another candidate. I think it&rsquo;s true that I don&rsquo;t represent the ideas of the Republican Party,&#148; Hart said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bertrand, 53, said Hart&rsquo;s views prompted him to enter the race. He returned April 9 from active duty in the Tennessee National Guard, including several months last year in Iraq. That was too late to have his name on the printed ballot for the Aug. 5 primary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tennessee law allows write-in candidates, but voters must request a write-in ballot. If he receives more votes than Hart, Bertand&rsquo;s name will appear as the Republican nominee on the Nov. 2 general election ballot.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#147;We&rsquo;re just getting started. I&rsquo;ve talked to the (party) chairmen in the 19 counties in the 8th district and everyone seems positive. It&rsquo;s going to take a lot of effort,&#148; Bertrand said.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#147;I saw Mr. Hart&rsquo;s Web site and decided somebody should do something. The beliefs he holds are just totally out of sync with anything the Republican Party believes. I couldn&rsquo;t see us putting forth a candidate that doesn&rsquo;t represent any of our views.&#148;
			</p>
			<p>
				Bertrand said he&rsquo;s for lower taxes and for increasing efforts to lure technical jobs to the district, including federal aid for the state technology centers in the region.
