<h1>Toronto Second In Proportion Of Foreign-Born</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><em>Erin Conway-Smith, Globe and Mail (Toronto), Jul. 16</em></p>
<p>Toronto has the second-largest proportion of foreign-born 
  residents of any city in the world, a new UN report says: Almost half of the 
  people who live there were born outside Canada.</p>
<p>The annual United Nations survey also shows that 
  Canada improved its standing on the human-development index, placing fourth 
  among 176 countries, four spots higher than last year.</p>
<p>The index takes into account such factors as life 
  expectancy, adult literacy, health, education and gross domestic product. </p>
<p>Canada moved up in the rating because it improved 
  slightly in the category of per capita gross domestic product and in the GDP 
  and education indexes. Iceland dropped from second to seventh place, and the 
  U.S. slid from seventh to eighth.</p>
<p>With 44 per cent of Torontonians born outside 
  of Canada, the city came second only to Miami, at 59 per cent, on a list of 
  the top 10 cities by share of foreign-born people.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, at 41 per cent, and Vancouver, at 
  37 per cent, rounded out the top four on the list, beating cities such as New 
  York, Sydney and London, which are typically considered among the most diverse 
  in the world.</p>
<p>&#147;You could come from anywhere in the world 
  and feel comfortable here,&#148; Sandra Bussin, Toronto&rsquo;s deputy mayor, 
  said yesterday after hearing the ranking.</p>
<p>&#147;That people from many different nationalities 
  and backgrounds can live in one city, in harmony, is a major achievement.&#148;</p>
<p>The data used to compile the list come from international 
  sources, including Statistics Canada and the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>According to the 2001 Census in Canada, the metropolitan 
  Toronto census area included about 2 million people born outside Canada, from 
  a total population of 4.7 million.</p>
<p>The City of Toronto&rsquo;s website says the largest 
  groups of immigrants to Toronto in the five years before the 2001 census were 
  from China (45,901), India (25,560) and Pakistan (17,495). The website says 
  more than 90 different ethnic groups are represented in the city.</p>
<p>Toronto&rsquo;s wide-ranging ethnic makeup differentiates 
  the city from first-place Miami, where most of the foreign-born are from Cuba. 
  According to 2002 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 96 per cent of foreign-born 
  people in Miami are from Latin America, although a further breakdown wasn&rsquo;t 
  available.</p>
<p>Tomas Regalado, a City of Miami commissioner, 
  said that of the 2.5 million people living in the greater Miami area, about 
  800,000 are Cuban. Other sizable ethnic groups include Nicaraguans and Haitians, 
  which he estimated at about 300,000 and 150,000 people.</p>
<p>&#147;It&rsquo;s geography: It&rsquo;s easy to get 
  here,&#148; he said, explaining why the city attracts so many people born in 
  other countries.</p>
<p>Miami&rsquo;s mayor, Manuel Diaz, said in a statement 
  that he considers diversity his city&rsquo;s most remarkable characteristic.</p>
<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s mayor expected his city to place 
  higher in the ranking. &#147;I&rsquo;m surprised we&rsquo;re fourth,&#148; Larry 
  Campbell said.</p>
<p>He said the predominant ethnic groups in Vancouver 
  are Chinese-Canadians and Indo-Canadians, although he added that many other 
  nations are represented.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell said that immigrants aren&rsquo;t 
  expected to assimilate when they move to Canada, but rather to add their cultures 
  into the mix.</p>
<p>&#147;I&rsquo;m sure that [Toronto Mayor] David 
  Miller would say the same thing; the reason we are great cities is because of 
  our diversity.&#148;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s UN human development report is 
  focused on the theme of cultural liberty in a diverse world. &#147;Driven by 
  globalization, the number of immigrants soared in the last decade, especially 
  to the high-income countries of Western Europe, North America and Australia,&#148; 
  the report said.</p>
<p>It added that more immigrants are keeping close 
  ties with their countries of origin through the Internet and low-cost air travel. 
  </p>
<p>Norway placed first on the UN&rsquo;s annual human-development 
  index, followed by Sweden, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
