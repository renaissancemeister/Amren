						<p><em>Lydia Saad, Gallup News Service, Jul. 8</em></p>
<p>PRINCETON, NJ &mdash; Gallup&rsquo;s annual Minority Rights and Relations survey, conducted June 9-30, finds that the American public has mostly positive perceptions of relations between blacks and whites, as well as between other racial and ethnic groups in the country today. Specifically, 72% of Americans think relations between whites and blacks are either &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; good; only 26% say they are &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; bad. White-Hispanic relations receive a similar review, while white-Asian relations are rated slightly better and black-Hispanic relations are rated slightly worse.</p>
<p><em><snip></em></p>
<p>Contrasted with these generally upbeat results about the state of race relations in the country, a different question pre-supposing problems exist between whites and blacks finds a majority of blacks pessimistic that the problems between the two races will ever be worked out. Whites, on the other hand, are slightly more optimistic.</p>
<p>When asked, &ldquo;Do you think that relations between blacks and whites will always be a problem for the United States, or that a solution will eventually be worked out?&rdquo;, 57% of blacks say relations will always be a problem, compared with 44% of whites and 42% of Hispanics who feel this way. A slim majority of whites and Hispanics are optimistic that the problems will be worked out.</p>

<p>I wonder WHO they surveyed? Maybe the whites were hand-selected from the exclusive gated communities, with income levels very high and making big profits from cheap labor. They never have experienced living next to someone who isn&rsquo;t &#8220;white acting&#8221;. Us ordinary people are often forced into situations where there are racial tensions, and we see very little if any of the economic benefits of immigration from developing countries. It&rsquo;s a known fact that the people who oppose forced integration tend to be low income. <br>

<p>&#8220;They&#8221; don&rsquo;t have to survey anyone. They can print whatever they like. <br>

<p>Obviously no one living near Federal Section 8 housing was a participant in the survey.</p>
<p>Our previous  had an apartment complex go up across the street. None of the locals knew that the landlord had received a cheap Fed load based on a certain percentage of the units being designated low-income Section 8.</p>
<p>The very first batch of tenants were all Black, either from LA or Portland. The second day after their arrival, five burglaries occurred in the neighborhood. After that it was just a flood of crime and violence.</p>
<p>I was able to sell my house pretty quick, but my other neighbors waited too long and word got out to the realtors. They couldn&rsquo;t give their s away.</p>
<p>Lets set up all future Section 8 ghettos next to the aforementioned &#8220;gated communities&#8221; and see what the survey results indicate. <br>

<p>Driving on the interstate is a place where I find little harmony between black drivers and myself. This lack of harmony occurs when I pass black people. There seems to be some type of phenomena that causes a lot people of all colors to resent being passed. This characteristic seems to be prevalent among young blacks (male and female) and ranges up to those that are middle-aged. There has been many times when I passed a black driver only to have them come roaring up behind me to literally try to run me off the road. Now, when I pass a car, I make sure to determine the color of the driver so as to know what type of reaction to expect. <br>

<p>One thing that this article didn&rsquo;t state is whether or not people were asked questions outside of their own race. I mean I&rsquo;m white, do you think it&rsquo;s fair for me to comment on black and hispanic relations? In this case, and for this purpose I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get an accuate picture if you ask people to comment about race relations outside of their own race. <br>

<p>Drew,</p>
<p>Do you drive on I-95 between New York and Richmond VA? I have also noticed the hyper-agressive driving of young blacks, both male and female. I thought I was the only one who noticed this. I respond to them by never letting them by.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Drew </p>
<p>To Razor:</p>
<p>I have run into hyper-aggressive blacks in Virginia. Where I always run into them is when I drive on interstate 40 going through the Greensboro/Durham area in North Carolina. My favorite method of dealing with these blacks is to use my car to slice em and dice em and leave them in my dust. I have had to back off on occasion when dealing with blacks in four or more vehicles as they became a hazard to everyone on the road. I have watched in amazement as they would bounce back and forth across the lanes like a ball in a pinball machine.<br>
