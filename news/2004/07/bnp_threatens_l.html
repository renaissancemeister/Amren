<h1><a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=3214976">BNP Threatens Legal Action over Frozen Bank Accounts</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>Scotsman.com, Jul. 17</i></p>
<p>The British National Party is considering taking 
  legal action after Barclays froze up to six of its bank accounts.<br>
  <br>
  The move came after a BBC documentary team secretly filmed members of the BNP 
  confessing to race-hate crime.<br>
  <br>
  BNP chairman Nick Griffin reacted by threatening legal action against Barclays, 
  claiming the move breached European human rights legislation.<br>
  <br>
  He branded the decision &#147;absolutely scandalous&#148; and admitted the party 
  might now find it difficult to open accounts with other banks.<br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Barclays was already reviewing its position on the BNP 
  before the BBC&rsquo;s Secret Agent film. However, the bank has refused to comment 
  on the matter, citing client confidentiality.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, West Yorkshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service issued a 
  joint statement in the wake of the Secret Agent film which said officers were 
  collecting tapes from the programme makers.<br>
  <br>
  They said the broadcast &#147;raises a number of issues which warrant further 
  investigation&#148;, and that it was liaising with programme makers.<br>
  <br>
  &#147;Working with our colleagues in the Crown Prosecution Service we will be 
  reviewing the material to identify what, if any, information of evidential value 
  it contains and decide on the appropriate action,&#148; according to the statement.<br>
  <br>
  Mr Griffin said a member of the party&rsquo;s treasury department was informed 
  about the freezing of its accounts yesterday afternoon.<br>
  <br>
  He said: &#147;This is an attempt to ban us by the back door. The next move 
  will be to look at the legal position.<br>
  <br>
  &#147;Barclays may find themselves up against European human rights legislation. 
  We have the right to hold political opinions and to impart them.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  Mr Griffin said the party&rsquo;s money had effectively been &#147;stolen&#148; 
  and claimed it amounted to thousands of pounds.<br>
  <br>
  He added: &#147;There was enough money to run a small but effective political 
  party.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  The party must have a bank account in Britain to comply with electoral commission 
  regulations, Mr Griffin added.<br>
  <br>
  Mr Griffin said: &#147;It is quite possible that we will not be able to find 
  another bank. We can&rsquo;t keep money under our mattresses.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  The documentary showed Mr Griffin condemning Islam as a &#147;vicious, wicked 
  faith&#148;&mdash;and claiming he would face seven years in prison if he made 
  the comments in public.<br>
  <br>
  A BBC reporter who spent six months undercover with the BNP recorded another 
  of the group&rsquo;s members, Steve Barkham, confessing to taking part in a racially-motivated 
  attack on an Asian man during the 2001 Bradford riots.<br>
  <br>
  Both Mr Barkham and Dave Midgley, a BNP candidate for council elections, have 
  now been expelled by the party.<br>
  <br>
  Mr Griffin continued his tirade against the Islamic faith on Thursday, branding 
  it &#147;a monster in our midst&#148;.<br>
  <br>
  In an interview broadcast on BBC&rsquo;s Newsnight, he apologised unreservedly 
  for some comments made during the documentary.<br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, there were also calls for Home Secretary David Blunkett to act 
  against the BNP.<br>
  <br>
  Magistrate Bary Malik, president of Bradford&rsquo;s Ahmadiyya Muslim Association, 
  said: &#147;I hope David Blunkett will take some action. The Home Secretary 
  should see there&rsquo;s no room for a party like this.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  In Parliament the BNP was dubbed a party of &#147;vile Nazis and thugs&#148; 
  by Commons Leader Peter Hain as all sides of the House condemned the far-right 
  group.<br>
  <br>
  Inayat Bunglawala, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, said that 
  the documentary &#147;has clearly exposed the British National Party for what 
  they really are.<br>
  <br>
  &#147;They have tried to cover themselves with a thin veneer of respectability 
  in describing themselves as a political party.&#148;<br>
  <br>
  The BNP took nearly a third of the votes in a council by-election result in 
  east London&rsquo;s Barking and Dagenham borough on Thursday night.<br>
  <br>
  The result at Valence ward came less than an hour after a BBC expose of the 
  party. Its candidate, Lawrence Rustem, came just over 10% behind Labour&rsquo;s 
  winner Donald Hemmett.<br>
  <br>
  Next door in the London Borough of Havering, in a by-election at Rainham and 
  Wennington, the BNP&rsquo;s Mark Blunden polled 549 votes&mdash;256 behind Labour&rsquo;s 
  Tony Ellis, who pipped the Tories by a margin of 29.<br>
  <br>
  In Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire, BNP candidates Nicholas Holt and Anthony 
  Dailly failed in their attempts to take two seats in the Labour stronghold ward 
  of Earcroft.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Barclays 
  Want to Steal Your Vote</b></p>
<p><i>BNP Website, Jul. 19</i></p>
<strong> 
<p>Barclays Want to Steal Your Vote&mdash;but can&rsquo;t 
  think of the right excuse. BNP Chairman, Nick Griffin reports. </p>
</strong> 
<p>Confusion reigns this morning in Barclays Bank 
  PLC over what seems to have been an over-hasty move by their PR department to 
  announce a top level decision to close down the BNP&rsquo;s bank accounts held 
  with them. The local branch holding the accounts still knew nothing whatsoever 
  about the decision this morning. Similarly, the promised &#147;urgent letter&#148; 
  to our National Treasurer from Barclays, which was supposed to arrive without 
  fail today, still has not materialised. <br>
  <br>
  Whether this is just incompetence on their part, or whether their Legal Department 
  are still desperately trying to come up with a form of words which will not 
  potentially land them with problems in any possible court action. In the meantime, 
  the Barclays branch in question has told us that our accounts are not closed 
  or frozen, and that we can continue banking as normal. Cheques are being deposited 
  and drawn on as per usual. </p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality broken </strong><br>
  <br>
  Our Legal Department have been researching the issue all weekend, and we will 
  be putting their skeleton argument on no fewer than ten possible areas for legal 
  redress to our London solicitor and a barrister within the next 24 hours. The 
  failure of the British Government to implement fully European Directive 9546 
  on banking confidentiality and related matters is of particular interest. <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission have been quick to note the potentially 
  very serious nature of this attack, since any party which is denied the capability 
  to run its finances openly within the UK could well be regarded as being in 
  breach of the Commission&rsquo;s very properly strict procedures for ensuring 
  transparency and acountability in party political funding. As a result, the 
  Barclays move is being discussed at a special meeting of the Electoral Commission 
  today. </p>
<p><strong>Protests</strong><br>
  <br>
  In various parts of the country, BNP organisers are planning demonstrations 
  against local Barclays branches. Several branches have already carried out spontaneous 
  protests, including one in Edinburgh on Saturday. </p>
<p><strong>The Barclays eagle&mdash;preying on British 
  voters?</strong></p>
<p>&#147;Barclays want to steal your vote&#148; is 
  emerging as a popular slogan, on account of the fact that the Electoral Commission 
  would have no option but to deregister any party which cannot meet its requirements, 
  which means that an inability to bank in Britain could lead to the BNP being 
  barred from standing in future elections. <br>
  <br>
  This affair is not therefore just an attack on the BNP, but on the right of 
  every elector in Britain to have the right to choose from a full slate of candidates. 
  Mr Blunkett, Mirror Group Newsapers and the sordid porn baron who owns the Daily 
  Express may not understand it, but democracy is as indivisible as free speech: 
  Either everyone has it or no-one does. BNP members and supporters are also telephoning 
  or writing to their local Barclays branches expressing their disgust at the 
  bank&rsquo;s attack on democratic freedom, and threatening to take their accounts, 
  credit card business and mortgages elsewhere. </p>
<p><strong>Business as usual </strong><br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, since the party leadership foresaw such an attack a long time ago, 
  other, reserve accounts with other banks are being swung into action. All donations, 
  subscriptions and such like should therefore be sent in as normal. Many thanks 
  to all concerned, especially the non-BNP supporters who have sent donations 
  as a way of expressing their belief that it is fundamentally wrong in principle 
  that a capitalist bank should feel justified in taking steps which could close 
  down lawful political party, regardless of what that party may believe in. </p>
