<h1><a href="https://www.worldnetdaily.com/letters.asp">Texas Cop Exposes Truth Of America&rsquo;s Border Security</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><em>David Watson, WorldNetDaily.com, Jul. 12</em></p>
<p>I have been employed as a police officer, a town marshal (yes, Texas still has a few), and a deputy sheriff. All this within seven years. I do not have to worry about speaking out and getting fired anymore &mdash; I am pretty much blackballed from the profession. </p>
<p>On [Joseph Farah&rsquo;s radio] show, I have heard uninformed people state that the police did nothing about this or that illegal alien problem. I cannot speak for the rest of the world, but here in Texas, you can&rsquo;t touch them. You cannot even ask them for a green card. You cannot even question them about their citizenship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or your job will be in grave jeopardy. There are subtle ways to work around it, but you have to tip toe, and be real careful, or a lawyer will have you crucified, and your department will run like hell. </p>
<p>These &ldquo;undocumented workers&rdquo; are a protected more than the horned toad. Let me tell you how this works, especially in rural Texas. These people work for nothing. So your farmers, feed yards, construction companies, and the like want them for labor purposes. These people are the pillars of the community that control the local government. They are the county commissioners, city councilmen, mayors, etc. They want them employed during the day, and disappear when the work day is done. </p>
<p>The common people in the town have to deal with the aftermath, and so do the police. They go to the country club and complain about &ldquo;those damn Mexicans&rdquo; when they engage in the culture they bring with them, but want them at work bright and early. Arrest the wrong one who needs to be at work and not in jail, and his employer makes a phone call. Bad things come down on you for arresting this poor immigrant, you&rsquo;re labeled a racist (by the person who the night before called them a &ldquo;damn Mexican&rdquo;), and the poor immigrant is released from jail to go back to work. </p>
<p>You are now in the hot seat. Put the police administrator in this position too many times, and you are going to lose your job for something petty. </p>
<p>This, of course, does not take into account the &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; that is now so very important in the modern day department. Nowadays, you are more than likely not going to get a cop job in the first place if you do not speak the language of our invaders. Departments are leaning heavy to the proper ethnicity of police applicants, to better serve the &ldquo;immigrant.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ironically, even though it is not proper to say, more bad things happen because of the close-knit Hispanic community. For example, you hire a Hispanic officer or dispatcher. They have intimate knowledge of the upcoming arrival of the Border Patrol. You can guarantee that when they arrive, there will not be an &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; to be found. </p>
<p>You can lay money on the fact that if you are going to run a search warrant, arrest warrant, or just pay a visit to the local Hispanic community, they will be warned. If your insider does not inform them, you can bet the administrator will make sure his butt is covered so that the people who control his future are well informed and can take appropriate measures. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we have the all important &ldquo;cultural sensitivity&rdquo; training we must endure. Agree with it or not, if you misbehave in class, you don&rsquo;t get the mandatory credit for the training. Therefore, you lose your license, and you have no job. In these classes, we are told we must take into consideration the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of the immigrant we are dealing with. </p>
<p>[For example], it may be permissible for a man to beat his wife and have sexual relations with his daughters in the country of his origin. We need to be sensitive to this, and heavily consider this when it comes time to press charges. We might want to consider ourselves a racist if we proceed without checking to see if this was acceptable in his &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; say in Mexico. And then, of course, you must deal with the aftermath of picking on the Mexican people, from those within your department, who are Mexican first, American when it is convenient. </p>
<p>Can you see how this dominoes? You get to the point where you could witness a Hispanic or black male walking down the street buck naked with a chainsaw in one hand and a severed head in the other, and you fail to see it. You get a sudden urge for donuts on the other side of town. You do not mean to be this way, it just builds on you. </p>
<p>Not one peace officer, that I have ever met, intends to be the way he is after a few years on the street. You just get trapped. You start out wanting to rescue lost children, and save the world from the evils of humanity, and before long, you just don&rsquo;t give a crap. This is when it happens. You either find away to become corrupt, subvert your own beliefs and integrity (and the printed law for that matter), or you just say &ldquo;screw it, people are not worth it,&rdquo; and walk away. </p>
<p>Being a peace officer is a calling. I brought  $875.50 a month my first job as a peace officer. This was in 1995! If I chose to have medical insurance for my wife, it would have cost me $435 a month. I could not afford to insure my wife. She had to put her education on hold because we could not afford it. We could not afford a car. She walked to work for me, so I could answer my calling. </p>
<p>But if I arrested a Mexican &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; for a blatant crime committed, I had to worry about how to pay for a lawyer if I arrested the wrong one, at the wrong time. I wish I had been given a different calling. The seven years I spent trying to serve and protect people was a waste. Get the picture? </p>
<p>Oh, by the way, My job as a deputy sheriff [was] on duty with no backup, in a county of 900 square miles, with about 8,000 citizens to serve, no city police, and about 40 percent Hispanic, I earned about $1,123 a month. No health insurance for my family. </p>
<p>I eventually said &ldquo;screw it, people are not worth it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I am now employed by the U.S. government. One of the first things I was instructed on at my present job, is to be &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; in what I say. I was informed that a guard was recently fired for saying &ldquo;blackbird.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This guard was sent to an alarm. When he arrived at the building where the alarm was tripped, he found that a blackbird was the culprit. So he notified dispatch that all was secure, a blackbird had tripped the alarm and he had removed it from the area. A complaint was filed by a person of color [claiming] he made a racist statement. It was found that he had &ldquo;made a racist statement,&rdquo; and was fired. </p>
<p>The upside is that I make five times what I made as a peace officer, my family is covered by health care, I have a retirement system in place, and I am not required to do a damn thing. My job is to remember to breathe while I am on duty. I am now able to feed, clothe and house my family, and do not have to do a damn thing for it. </p>
<p>This makes it very easy to not give a damn if I can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;blackbird,&rdquo; or acknowledge the fact that certain minority groups are destroying my city, county, state and country. This is why we do not deserve the country, and freedom we have been given.</p>
