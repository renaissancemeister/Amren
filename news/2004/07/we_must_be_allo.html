						<p><em>Will Cummins, Telegraph (UK), Jul. 11</em></p>
<p>In the time of Marcus Aurelius, Christianity was a growing force within the Roman Empire. His ministers asked him if the state should join the non-Christian majority in attacking the new religion, or seek to protect it. The Emperor&rsquo;s reply is found in his Meditations. The state&rsquo;s response to Christianity, he said, or to anything else, should be determined by one simple question: &ldquo;What is the thing in itself? What does it do?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Today, the Government faces a similar dilemma regarding Islam. In response, the  Secretary announced plans last week to make vilification of Islam a crime. He insisted that his law to &ldquo;ban incitement to religious hatred&rdquo; was meant to defend every faith. However, only Muslims have asked for immunity. The legislation would &ldquo;close a loophole&rdquo;, David Blunkett observed, because inciting hatred of people on racial grounds is illegal in the UK, but inciting hatred of them on the grounds of belief is not.</p>
<p>The problem is that a virulent hatred of Muslims can no more be racism than a virulent hatred of Marxists or Tories. Nobody is a member of a race by choice. Such groups are protected from attack because it is unfair to malign human beings for something they cannot help. However, nobody is a member of a community of belief except by choice, which is why those who have decided to enter or remain within one are never protected. Were such choices not open to the severest censure, we could no longer call our country a democracy.</p>
<p>It is a red herring for supporters of Mr Blunkett&rsquo;s law to say that Muslims should be shielded by the race laws because Jews and Sikhs are. It is the racial persons of Jews and Sikhs that are protected, not their beliefs. In any case, Sikhism and Judaism are race cults which actively discourage converts. It is almost impossible to become a member of either religion unless you are racially Jewish or Punjabi. They are diametrically opposed to inclusive ideologies like Christianity or Islam, which seek to convert everybody.</p>
<p>Some propose special protection for Muslims by saying that Islam is a racial identity because three of the four schools of Islamic law enjoin faithful Muslims to murder anyone who wishes to leave the faith, thus limiting every Muslim&rsquo;s freedom of action. But is this a point in Islam&rsquo;s favour? And is this the sort of religion we want to throw people into prison for condemning?</p>
<p>To argue that Islam should have special protection because it is a &ldquo;religion&rdquo; while Marxism or Conservatism are &ldquo;merely philosophies&rdquo; is equally specious. All that divides a religion from a secular ideology is something whose existence &mdash; supernatural support &mdash; is disputed by adherents of the latter. To privilege supernatural belief-systems by law would be to impose the view of the faithful about this on everyone, the situation that prevailed in the Middle Ages. This time, it is Islam, not Christianity, that New Labour wants to impose on Christendom.</p>
<p>A society in which one cannot revile a religion and its members is one in which there are limits to the human spirit. The Islamic world was intellectually and economically wrecked by its decision to put religion beyond the reach of invective, which is simply an extreme form of debate. By so doing, it put science and art beyond the reach of experiment, too. Now, at the behest of Muslim foreigners who have forced themselves on us, New Labour wants to import the same catastrophe into our own society.</p>
<p>In a recent television panel, Iqbal Sacranie explained why the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), the organisation he leads, had pushed for this legislation. The British should be allowed not to believe in Islam, he said (thanks, Mr Sacranie!), but they should not be permitted to &ldquo;criticise&rdquo; it.</p>
<p>Ken Livingstone has gone even further. On Wednesday, the Mayor of London welcomed to City Hall the Qatari divine Dr Yusuf al-Qaradawi, according to the MCB &ldquo;an Islamic scholar held in great respect throughout the Islamic world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Basing his teaching on Islam&rsquo;s holiest texts, Dr al-Qaradawi has urged his fellow Muslims to beat their wives; to use child suicide bombers to kill female and infant civilians; to murder Jews, homosexuals and British servicemen; and to colonise, desecrate and usurp Christian Rome.</p>
<p>Mr Livingstone said that the newspapers that had condemned Dr al-Qaradawi for such views &ldquo;showed why this legislation [Blunkett&rsquo;s] is necessary&rdquo;. It was the critics of Dr al-Qaradawi&rsquo;s beliefs, Mr Livingstone insisted, who were, as the Muslim Association of Britain put it, &ldquo;the image of evil&rdquo;. Dr al-Qaradawi, a mainstream figure in a major religion, had endorsed Jew lynching and wife beating: Mr Livingstone seemed to imply that, like Islam, such activities should therefore be above criticism.</p>
<p>This brings us to the nub of the issue: the fact that Islam&rsquo;s teachings are completely unlike those of other faiths. The Government shows no sign of understanding this. Defending his proposed legislation, Mr Blunkett, for instance, said: &ldquo;It applies equally to far-Right evangelical Christians as to extremists in the Islamic faith.&rdquo; But what &ldquo;far-Right evangelical Christian&rdquo; has ever proposed or endorsed anything as horrifying as what the moderate Muslim regards as normal?</p>
<p>In Roman Polanski&rsquo;s film Chinatown, the villain, John Huston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Noah Cross&rdquo;, murderous tycoon, asks the private detective character, played by Jack Nicholson: &ldquo;Exactly what do you know about me, Mr Gittes?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mainly that you&rsquo;re too respectable to want your name in the papers,&rdquo; Gittes replies. &ldquo;Course I&rsquo;m respectable!&rdquo; Cross exclaims. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old! Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough!&rdquo; The same is true of religions.</p>
<p>Our rulers know as much about Islam as Gittes knows about Cross: that it has been &ldquo;around long enough&rdquo; (since the seventh century); that it &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t want its name in the papers&rdquo; (except on its own terms); and that it is sanctified by the principle, central to multiculturalism, that any civilisation, however repulsive, has the same value as any other, however benign, and is entitled to protection and praise simply by virtue of existing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to paraphrase Noah Cross in his warning to Jake Gittes: &ldquo;You may think you know what you&rsquo;re dealing with, Mr Blunkett &mdash; but, believe me, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This writer seems to accept the law outlawing &#8220;inciting raciail hatred.&#8221; Why is this even accepted by him? It&rsquo;s a perfectly valid political opinion. If I don&rsquo;t like such and such a group, why can&rsquo;t I run around saying, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like these people and want laws to keep them out.&#8221;<br>

<p>This article puts the argument against Islam succinctly and in terms simple enough for even the most brainwashed liberal to understand. All the evils committed in the name of Christianity have been done because the perpetrators were not adhering to Christian doctrine; Islamic misdeeds, on the other hand, are committed by those adhering strictly to the doctrine. There is no such thing as a moderate Muslim! To follow such a base, authoritative, vicious faith is to be without intrinsic morality or higher intellect!<br>

<p>If you banned &#8220;incitement to religious hatred&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t you in effect ban Islam? <br>

<p>What pathetic, cowardly, twisted nonsense. England has degenerated utterly into liberalism&rsquo;s dark dream. It&rsquo;s as though the &#8220;social immune system&#8221; has been turned off. In the body, if the immune system is turned off, one will quickly die a horrible death from the invading hoards of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Is this the fate of European socieity? To survive the worst the planet could offer, and to finally conquer the earth. Only at last to be destroyed from within. <br>

<p>The bottom line is that Islam and Muslims are not welcome in the Western world. Whites everywhere need to wake up and stop this nonsense before it gets completely out of control.</p>
<p>The Crusaders did not fight for 196 (1095-1291) years against Arab and Turkish invaders, nor did the Greeks, against the Ottoman leviathan, for us to simply turn over our countries to the Third World slime that now inhabits the territories of long-dead Islamic empires.<br>

<p>Mr. Cummins has made a cogent point. We need only to look to Belgium, where they have outlawed a political party already, to see where these laws are going . How about discourse among political parties? or speeches against the government? Would not inflammatory speeches incited hatred against government employees? Thus forcing the government to restrict &#8220;hate speech&#8221; against itself?</p>
<p>Our biggest strength is our bissgest flaw. We are lovers of law and order, unfortunately we are slaves to her as well. Other non-white cultures do not feel the need to adhere to laws and propriety as we do and on this front they are winning. Non-white immigrants are using our own laws against us and unless we change our laws and our attitudes we will continue to be beaten up.</p>
<p>The solution is clear and everyone reading this post knows it. STOP non-white immigration, encourage white birthrates, and eliminate hate crime laws. All this can be done in one Presidential term, but who will do it when pandering to the illegal alien is more important than that of the citizen?</p>
<p>I am fininding it increasingly difficult not to abandon our wonderful country (America), but I clearly can not go to the UK or even most of Europe, alas where one wonders if we whites will ever have a place to ourselves again.<br>

<p>Pretty much everything I have read about Islam is disturbing. I have no doubt that except for the ones they want to keep as slaves, the fanatic Muslims fervent wish is to kill all &#8220;non-believers.&#8221; That means they have marked me for death. Of course a lot of people would say I&rsquo;m just being paranoid.<br>

<p>It looks like Orwell was right and it will be England that implements the most oppressive, politically correct speech and thought crime restrictions.</p>
<p>This opens up a lot of opportunity for us in the USA. We have the 1st Amendment and we should step in via the internet to help our kin folk in the UK get the truth out.</p>
<p>There is a lot of good news in this hideous story. The best news is that the anti White PC Marxist - one of the worst being Red Ken Livingston have made a huge mistake in making Islamic extremists their pet minorities.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do some Pym Fortuyn type work and show that the proponents of open borders immigration are welcoming Muslim extremists who pack soccer stadiums to cheer the execution of women who dare show their faces in public! Also, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to present horrible anti Jewish statements by these Muslim extremists immigrants to show that the PC multiculturalists are importing hatred and murder of Jewish people.<br>
