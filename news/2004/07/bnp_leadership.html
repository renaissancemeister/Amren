<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>British 
              National Party, July</i></p>
            <p> 
            <p>A highly productive BNP Leadership 
              Conference was held over the weekend of 3<sup>rd</sup>&mdash;4<sup>th</sup> 
              July in mid-Wales at the  of National Chairman Nick Griffin. 
              More than thirty key officials attended, with regional representatives 
              from London, the South East, the South West, West Midlands, East 
              Midlands, Wales, the North West, Yorkshire, the North East, Scotland 
              and Ulster present, along with national officials from Administration, 
              Treasury, Elections, IT, Cultural and Security Departments.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>Starting with a critically constructive 
              review of the recent election campaigns, the weekend went on with 
              a series of debates and workshop sessions to examine a wide range 
              of future initiatives and improvements to our existing operations 
              at all levels of the party. </p>
            <p> 
            <p>A key debate on the Sunday was initiated 
              by the head of the BNP&rsquo;s Legal Department, Lee Barnes, who 
              explained the implications of a complaint brought by an Asian individual 
              acting with the assistance of the Orwellian Commission for Racial 
              Equality, alleging discrimination on the grounds of being rejected 
              for membership of the party in accordance with our constitutional 
              requirement that all members be of &#147;British or closely kindred 
              native European stock.&#148;</p>
            <p> 
            <p>Evidence was also presented that other 
              pro-minority racist ethnic groups are preparing similar legal assaults 
              against the right of the native peoples of the British Isles to 
              preserve just one organisation whose primary purpose is to stand 
              up for them, in a way which is perfectly normal and acceptable to 
              our Masters when it comes to organisations for &lsquo;minorities&rsquo;, 
              such as the Black Police Officers&rsquo; Association, Asian Lawyers&rsquo; 
              Association, etc.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>Mr Barnes said that, in his opinion 
              (backed up by the BNP&rsquo;s main solicitor), this is a potentially 
              fatal attack on the British National Party, potentially providing 
              our opponents with the means to bleed us to death with compensation 
              law suits, and/or to have the party deregistered by the Electoral 
              Commission, thereby banning us from contesting elections. Let us 
              repeat that: The British National Party could be banned from doing 
              what political parties exist to do&mdash;fight and win elections. 
              </p>
            <p> 
            <p>He noted the very clear parallel between 
              this and the further advanced legal assault by the equally morally 
              bankrupt Belgian state on the Vlaams Blok, which is one last desperate 
              legal appeal away from being declared a &lsquo;racist&rsquo; organisation 
              and being banned, despite having mass electoral support and a clear 
              democratic mandate to speak for the people of Flanders. </p>
            <p> 
            <p>This is not a theoretical risk; it 
              is being done to a modern, democratic, mainstream, successful nationalist 
              political party just a few score miles away from the east coast 
              of England in the heart of the European Union. After all the frauds 
              and fiddles pulled during the European Election, no rational British 
              nationalist can be in any doubt that Blair &amp; Co would do precisely 
              the same thing to us if we are slow and stupid enough to give them 
              the opportunity and the excuse.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>The aim of this strategy, he stated, 
              is not just to s us winning elections, but to force us down a 
              road towards confrontation and violence, something disastrously 
              counter-productive for us and our cause, but ideal for a State which 
              has lost all democratic legitimacy by its reliance on gerrymandered 
              and fraudulent elections, and which needs violence to provide it 
              with the justification to turn to repression and violence of its 
              own.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>This appears at first sight to give 
              the BNP just three choices of how to deal with a threat which <i>cannot</i> 
              be wished away or ignored: </p>
            <p> 
            <ol type="a">
              <p> 
              <p> 
              &mdash;Maintain its present membership policy, be barred 
                from contesting elections and become a powerless nostalgic sect;</li>
              <p> 
              <p> 
              <p> 
              &mdash;Maintain its present membership policy, switch 
                all effort away from electioneering, accept that we will never 
                obtain the state power needed to reverse present trends, and move 
                towards becoming a Civil Rights movement and cultural association 
                aiming to fight a rearguard action on behalf of a native population 
                facing the certainty of becoming a minority in our own country;</li>
              <p> 
              <p> 
              <p> 
              &mdash;Change its constitution and allow non-whites to 
                join the party as long as they say they agree with our policies.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> 
            <p>It was unanimously agreed that &lsquo;Option&rsquo; 
              a) is unacceptable as it would involve certain defeat, that &lsquo;Option&rsquo; 
              b)has very limited appeal and that even if we became effective the 
              lack of a democratic mandate would make it easy for the Powers That 
              Be to ban us outright, and that Option c) would split the party, 
              leave it vulnerable to being hijacked by a determined &lsquo;minority&rsquo; 
              group, and constitutes a betrayal of our basic principles, hence 
              is just as unacceptable as &lsquo;Option&rsquo; a). </p>
            <p> 
            <p>Mr Barnes and BNP leader Nick Griffin 
              then presented the broad outline of an alternative, far more radical, 
              proposal which they have worked out since the CRE threat arrived 
              earlier this year:</p>
            <p> 
            <p>This is to put to a vote of the party&rsquo;s 
              entire membership a proposal to change the BNP&rsquo;s constitution 
              by including our a statement of our belief that human biological, 
              ethnic and cultural diversity is the beneficial product of the will 
              of either God or nature, and is at the very root of our humanity. 
              </p>
            <p> 
            <p>The statement would go on to point 
              out that this human diversity is under threat from both impersonal 
              forces of capitalist globalism and the world-shrinking impact of 
              modern technology, and from the integrationist model of multi-racism 
              and multi-culturalism. Liberal advocacy of &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; 
              is in fact verbal camouflage for a system which, left unchecked, 
              will extinguish all genuine diversity in a melting pot in which 
              the priceless patchwork of human variety is merged into a rootless, 
              coffee-coloured, culture-free herd of atomised consumers of the 
              products of a handful of gigantic multi-national corporations.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>Being aware of the truly genocidal 
              implications of integrationist multi-culturalism, we must commit 
              the party to a strong, rational and principled statement of our 
              opposition to racial integration and cultural homogenisation. Furthermore, 
              in our technologically shrunken world, in which several other races 
              and cultures have mastered Western economic innovations, and overtaken 
              the numerical advantage which the West developed during the Industrial 
              Revolution, the old white supremacist model for white survival is 
              now obsolete. Racial separatists of all peoples and cultures must 
              work side-by-side to provide a conscious, worldwide resistance to 
              the forces which would wipe us all out by mixing us up. Genocide 
              by cultural homogenisation and the bedchamber rather than by cultural 
              oppression and the gas chamber.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>In place of either hatred or liberal 
              surrender, we must call upon all peoples, of all races, cultures 
              and religions to respond to the threat to our identities posed by 
              capitalist globalism by agreeing to live separately even when our 
              communities are forced&mdash;or even choose&mdash;to live side by 
              side.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>Self-evidently, there are large numbers 
              of non-whites living in Britain who understand that this country 
              is &#147;full up&#148; and who, even more importantly, no more want 
              to see their grandchildren as mixed race, culturally rootless consumers 
              than we do.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>There is no need to discriminate against 
              such people who share our basic worldview and our deepest concerns, 
              but nor is there any moral or legal need for us to mix with them, 
              either socially or politically. The solution is not to discriminate 
              against them by denying them the right to join our British National 
              Party, but to level the playing field by letting them join their 
              own British National Party. The BNP is for anyone who agrees with 
              our statement of principles, but since our principles would&mdash;if 
              this change is adopted&mdash;include racial and cultural segregation, 
              they would no more want or be entitled to join <i>our</i> BNP than 
              we would want or be entitled to join <i>theirs</i>.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be discriminating 
              against them by not having them at <i>our</i> Red-White-and-Blue, 
              because they would have the precisely equal right to keep<i> their</i> 
              own Red-White-and-Blue for their own people. We&rsquo;d all be proud 
              to live in Britain, but we&rsquo;d all agree on the need to avoid 
              a drift towards the destruction of our precious diversity by keeping 
              ourselves strictly to ourselves.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>We would share a common set of aims, 
              and a common constitution, but they would elect their leaders, and 
              we would elect ours. We could change our constitution, and they 
              could change theirs. But we couldn&rsquo;t interfere in each others&rsquo; 
              business or organisations in any way, shape or form. If enough Sikhs 
              or Hindus or blacks or Chinese or Muslims (provided they felt able 
              to agree to a constitution which insists that Britain must remain 
              under secular democratic government, faithful to the ancient European 
              pagan and Christian traditions of this land) want to form their 
              own BNPs then we will gladly give them our model constitution and 
              let them get on with it. There is even scope for a mixed race operation 
              provided that those in it agree&mdash;as it not uncommon among such 
              unfortunates&mdash;that racial integration is fundamentally bad and 
              often produces offspring who feel lost, confused and unease with 
              either community or culture.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>And when our BNP is voted into power, 
              we would expect these other BNPs to play a very significant role 
              in helping us to reverse the entire genocidal model of multi-culturalism 
              by acting as leading forces within their own communities for peaceful 
              separation and massive, phased, assisted and voluntary resettlement 
              in their lands of ethnic origin.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>The finer details of this whole proposal 
              are still to be worked out, but this general picture should give 
              all interested parties at least a starting point in the debate. 
              If anyone out there can provide a better solution, which provides 
              an even more effective way of showing that we are not unrealistic 
              supremacist bigots, while at the same time making clear our fundamental 
              opposition to genocide through integration, we will be very pleased 
              to adopt such a proposal.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>Provided whatever final position emerges 
              from this debate is acceptable to a two-thirds majority of the BNP&rsquo;s 
              membership voting in a secret postal ballot, the unanimous opinion 
              of the Leadership Conference is that the anti-white tax-guzzlers 
              at the Commission for Racial Equality will have fallen well-deserved 
              victims of the Law of Unintended Consequences. </p>
            <p> 
            <p>Having set out to have us effectively 
              banned, all they might achieve in the end is to concentrate our 
              minds on finding the ideological Holy Grail that has eluded every 
              nationalist party up until now&mdash;a way to synthesise what is 
              known in nationalist short-hand as the &lsquo;14 Words&rsquo; (&#147;We 
              must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children&#148;) 
              with a non-racist, universally applicable critique of the disastrous 
              impact of liberal capitalism on human diversity. </p>
            <p> 
            <p>At last we see that there is another 
              choice other than legally and electorally fatal discrimination on 
              the one hand, or ideologically incoherent, short-termist civic nationalism 
              on the other. We can choose to agree to work side-by-side but separately 
              to preserve that which we all hold most dear.</p>
            <p> 
            <p>The diversity-mongers will be hoist 
              with their own petard, helping us give reassurance to the millions 
              of voters who would not back a racist or supremacist BNP while at 
              the same time ensuring that, when we win, we will get what we&rsquo;ve 
              fought for through the long years of our struggle. </p>
            <p> 
            <p>One last thing: If the liberals, in 
              the meantime, changed the law again to outlaw our new approach, 
              we would not just have bought time before having to settle for something 
              far less satisfactory in order to continue our battle for survival. 
              Most important of all, we would force the liberals to drop their 
              mask and to admit that their integrationist multi-culturalism is 
              not about &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; but about deliberate, intentional 
              genocide. That would be a better position for us to progress from 
              than where we are today.</p>

<p>This is a make or break issue for the premier white nationalist party of the UK. They have to be flexible, and find a solution that makes the BNP stronger. And the rank and file must be loyal and patient and keep focussed on the bigger picture.</p>
<p>It is clearly unfair that the BNP can&rsquo;t organise itself along racial lines yet there are so many organisatons which are exclusively for blacks and Asians. Yet although white people whine and moan in the pub or in the living room, they are too lazy or ignorant to go down to the polling station on election day and vote for the BNP. They will get the country they deserve.<br>

<p>This article is an example of the way &#8220;Liberal Democracies&#8221; control democracy. In this case it&rsquo;s using civil suits to disrupt and damage a party. In the U.S., in the 2000 presidential election, legal maneuvering by the FEC delayed the Reform party from receiving the $12,000,000 in election funds. In Australia, trumpted up charges against Pauline Hanson have eliminated her from the political process. Different means achieving the same end. <br>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t the BNP set up a fighting fund for counter-legal action against every explicitly black or Asian group? Perhaps Mutually Assured Destruction would work. It might also generate a good deal of publicity - fence-sitting Brits may not yet have understood the reality of the situation that faces them, but they instinctively dislike double standards.<br>

<p>As others have observed, we can bring the inconsistency of ethnic associations (for all except indigenous Brits) to public attention. But I think we should go further and call their bluff. Why not open membership of the BNP to all, but restate the constitution&rsquo;s aims? For example, &#8220;We question the current orthodoxy that a nation can support many ethnic groups without problems. We reject continued immigration for this reason and to protect the wages of the poor. The multicultural experiment is failing, and we must act now to limit further harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our liberal elites secretly agree with this, as we can see from the small numbers of those who live in &#8220;vibrant&#8221; areas, or send their childrent to inner-city state schools. Once they can no longer press the racist button, the BNP can become stronger. <br>

<p>option a. no good</p>
<p>option b. no good</p>
<p>option c. Could work. I wish I knew more about how the leadership was chosen. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to have a &#8220;minority&#8221; group in the BNP so long as it has no leadership power. Controling the leadership makeup with sufficient barriers of entry can work. Every prowhite organization has to worry about infiltration. I think it&rsquo;s best that new leadership be chosen by the old leadership behind closed doors long before the old dies out, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>The direction that Mr Barnes and Nick Griffin presented, if allowed, is the best way to go. All prowhite organiztions will have to work on how the white massess perceive them if they are to go &#8220;main stream&#8221;. This move would but the BNP in the best possible light in two major ways:</p>
<p>1. It would make it clear that it&rsquo;s not about money, power, or just skin color, it&rsquo;s a phoilophy to make Britin a better place by solving a racial problem. It&rsquo;s hard for the media to claim that the BNP just hates to hate, or just wants to &#8220;use&#8221; minorities if the BNP opens up to them in any way.</p>
<p>2. It&rsquo;s also hard for the media to claim that they want to kill all nonwhites if they work with nonwhites.</p>
<p>Tacticly there are two main benefits and one major draw back that I see. Benefits:</p>
<p>1. Different factions of the BNP would not compete in the same districts. thereby putting even more presure on the more popular parties.</p>
<p>2. All the other parties would have to tailor their message so as to reflect the increased polorization that the &#8220;NEW BNP&#8221; would bring. This polorization process is extremely important it will and must play a large roll in shifting the mindset of whites, and they must see this shift(polorization) coming from both nonwhites and whites alike.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that it will divide up the land of Britain. As each new part of the &#8220;New BNP&#8221; gains a foot hold it will lay claim to a district. Asking them to give up that land can not be expected under any circumstance. You might as well ask them to leave now. To tell you the truth I don&rsquo;t see a way to get out of this mess without lossing land. Perhaps the white race will learn not to use cheep nonwhite labor in the furture if land is the ultimite price we pay. Or perhaps we will be able to find a solution along the way.<br>
 </p>

From: Brian </p>
<p>The BNP may be forced by intimidation to accept ethnic membership, but they should definitely not go down this road as a matter of choice. It is pointless to try and pander to the current consensus or the swamp of the floating voter with this kind of tactic - all that happens is that you are hollowed out from within. The white masses don&rsquo;t need a &#8220;moderate&#8221; alternative privileged with a few crumbs of exposure from the conventional media table, time will kick the masses into action, because the destruction of Britain like the destruction of all white countries is accelerating. There is literally nowhere left to hide. The instinct for self-preservation will take over at some point and when it does they need a party that is genuinely their champion rather than another establishment placebo.<br>
