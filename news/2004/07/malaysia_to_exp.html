						<p><em>Jonathan Kent, BBC News Online, Jul. 13</em></p>
<p>The Malaysian government says it plans to expel more than a million illegal migrant workers. </p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s  Minister says 400,000 members of Malaysia&rsquo;s volunteer corps will be mobilised and special squads are already being trained to enforce their removal. </p>
<p>No official reason has been given, but there is widespread concern in Malaysia about rising levels of crime. </p>
<p>The government estimates that there are around 2.5 million foreign workers in Malaysia, forming around 10% of the population, and that half of them are here illegally. </p>
<p><strong>Forced removal</strong></p>
<p> Minister Azmi Khalid warned the businesses that employ the illegal immigrants not to complain when their workers are rounded up. &ldquo;We are serious,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Two years ago the government carried out a similar operation. There were huge crowds at ports and airports as hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly from Indonesia, the Philippines and the Indian sub-continent, tried to beat the deadline to leave. </p>
<p>But building sites in Kuala Lumpur and around the country came to a standstill and restaurants cut back their menus as workers headed . However, when the operation to remove them had run its course, the workers drifted back. </p>
<p>Then, the government said it had taken action because illegal immigrants were responsible for an increase in crime. </p>
<p><strong>Fear of crime</strong></p>
<p>With the Malaysian papers full of reports of violent robberies allegedly involving foreigners, crime may again have prompted the authorities to take a tough line. </p>
<p>However, the minister didn&rsquo;t spell out exactly when the round-up would take place. </p>
<p>He said illegal workers would be thrown out before Malaysia completes the introduction of its new microchip identity card, but no-one seems to know when that will be. </p>

<p>I had an idea for a massive round-up where the illegals would cooperate.</p>
<p>I remember a few years back the illegals fell prey to one of those crazy rumors that periodically get started. The rumor that time was that the INS was going to do an amnesty but was establishing credentials right then so when they later announced the amnesty you&rsquo;d have to have this INS documentation.</p>
<p>There were lines blocks long outside the INS offices.</p>
<p>What I would do is start these rumors again and then when they&rsquo;d show up, use their presense as ipso facto proof that they&rsquo;re here illegally and deport them immediately. Of course you&rsquo;d have to be really sneaky about the actual deportation so they dont all scatter when they realize what&rsquo;s going on. You would process them in stages like a cattle slaughter (bad analogy I know.) For example, you&rsquo;d establish at stage one that they are here illegally and need the INS &#8220;document&#8221;. Then they&rsquo;d be led one by one into the back and arrested and led to busses that had the windows covered. Then they&rsquo;d be driven to charter flights to Mexico or whereever.</p>
<p>You could go all day before they figured it out. I bet some would even show up the next day.<br>

<p>Malaysians are smarter than white people. They also have a better understanding of who is behind the curtain with respect to American foreign policy.<br>

<p>There is no reason   &mdash;   logistical or ethical   &mdash;   why we shouldn&rsquo;t do the same thing. It&rsquo;s all about ideology. Of course, don&rsquo;t waste your time looking for articles in Western publications condemning Malaysia for refusing to embrace the benefits of diversity. Only Western countries are required to surrender their cultures and national characters.</p>
<p>Nothing hardens my right-wing convictions more than the utter hypocrisy of the left (and, sadly, too many so-called conservatives   &mdash;   such as business owners who profit from illegal labor).<br>

<p>Look at Rushton&rsquo;s and Lynn&rsquo;s stats showing Malays with mean IQs around 90 and ethnic Chinese at around 105 (mean IQ of whites set at 100). <br>

From: Al Ross </p>
<p>Notice the gratuitous comment from the lefty BBC hack -&#8216;No official reason was given by the Malaysian Government&rsquo;. There is no requirement to give a reason for enforcing the law. Sonny Bono put it best when asked what he thought of illegal immigration. Said Sonny &#8216;Its illegal&rsquo;.<br>
