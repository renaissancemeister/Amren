<h1>Ralph Nader&rsquo;s Immigration Platform</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>Nader 
              for President website</i></p>
            <p>Immigration presents challenges and 
              opportunities for the United States. According the U.S. Census Bureau 
              the United States is undergoing an unprecedented wave of immigration. 
              According to the Census, during the 1990s, an average of more than 
              1.3 million immigrants&mdash;legal and illegal&mdash;settled in the 
              United States each year. In less than 50 years, the U.S. Census 
              Bureau projects that immigration will cause the population of the 
              United States to increase from its present 288 million to more than 
              400 million. </p>
            <p>According to the US Census Bureau, 
              the foreign-born population of the United States is currently 33.1 
              million. This is unparalleled in American history. It is more than 
              triple the 9.6 million in 1970 and more than double the 14.1 million 
              in 1980. Of this total, the Census Bureau estimates 8-9 million 
              are illegal immigrants. The 57 percent increase from 19.8 million 
              in 1990 to 31.1 million in 2000, is also without precedent in our 
              history, both numerically and proportionately. Even during the great 
              wave of immigration from 1900 to 1910, the foreign-born population 
              grew by only 3.2 million (or 31 percent), from 10.3 million to 13.5 
              million. However, as a percentage of the U.S. population immigrants 
              are half of the well over 20% of the U.S. population that immigrants 
              constituted in 1912&mdash;the actual highpoint of immigrant presence 
              in the U.S. The Census Bureau estimates are conservative, other 
              estimates indicate a considerably higher number of illegal immigrants. 
              </p>
            <p>The Immigration and Nationality Act 
              allows approximately 800,000 people to settle here each year as 
              permanent residents including about 480,000 who are admitted to 
              reunite with their spouses, children, parents and/or siblings; about 
              140,000 who are admitted to fill jobs for which the U.S. Department 
              of Labor has determined no American workers are available; about 
              110,000 refugees who have proven their claims of political or religious 
              persecution in their lands; and about 55,000 who are admitted 
              under a &#147;diversity&#148; lottery, begun in 1990, that mainly 
              benefits young European and African immigrants. </p>
            <p>Immigration has major implications 
              for the United States creating costs and benefits for our country. 
              We need a more vigorous debate on immigration policies and how it 
              intersects with other policy choices we make. Immigration issues 
              relate to our foreign policy&mdash;particularly U.S. support for 
              dictators and oligarchs or trade policy which re-enforces low paid 
              labor and blocks the power of trade unions. It also relates to our 
              domestic policies&mdash;low wages for many U.S. workers, rising poverty, 
              providing social and health services, housing and security. Immigration 
              links to all these issues. </p>
            <p>As long as our foreign policy supports 
              dictators and oligarchs south of our borders, there are going to 
              be desperate, oppressed people moving north over our border where 
              employers like Tysons Foods illegally employ them at very low wages 
              but even these low wage jobs are many times what would be made in 
              Mexico. Since 1985, U.S. spending on border enforcement has increased 
              by a factor of six, the number of U.S. border patrol agents doubled 
              and hours spent patrolling the borders tripled. The U.S. Border 
              Patrol has a budget well in excess of $1 billion annually. But even 
              with all of this expansion illegal immigration continues to expand. 
              </p>
            <p>While the gap in wages between the 
              United States and poor countries is vast, serious students of immigration 
              point out that only a tiny percentage of people from any nation 
              ever choose to emigrate from their s: it is rarely the poorest 
              who do so since they lack the necessary resources and contacts. 
              Immigration is a process caused not by attraction of higher wages 
              alone&mdash;since much of India, Mexico and China would have emptied 
              into the United States were this the case and they clearly have 
              not&mdash;but primarily caused by the inability of people to continue 
              to live decently in their  countries. In the days of the great 
              Ellis Island immigrations from Europe, this was due in large part 
              to the privatization of common lands throughout the Continent and 
              the flood of cheap American grain driving farmers out of business. 
              (While economics was a major factor other issues included religious 
              and political oppression.) In our day this is primarily the result 
              of the policies of NAFTA, the WTO, the Structural Adjustment Programs 
              of the IMF and World Bank and the predatory policies of multinational 
              corporations. </p>
            <p>Part of the problem involves NAFTA. 
              For example, the flood of cheap corn and other commodities into 
              Mexico has dispossessed over a million Mexican farmers, and with 
              their families, they either go to the urban slums or, in their desperation, 
              head north. </p>
            <p>The United States should not be in 
              the business of Brain Draining skilled talent, especially from developing 
              countries. We are importing the best engineers, scientists, software 
              people, doctors, entrepreneurs who should be in their countries, 
              building their own countries. The long term solution to immigration 
              is reducing the rich poor divide between the United States and other 
              nations by peacefully supporting democratic movements. </p>
            <p>In addition to this being a long-standing 
              brain drain of developing countries, often it undermines employment 
              in the U.S. We have got many unemployed software people here. Regarding 
              manual labor, the Wall Street Journal editors are for near open-borders 
              policy in large part because they want a cheap wage policy. Bringing 
              in cheap labor to the United States reduces wages here&mdash;immigration 
              increases the supply of U.S. labor, reduces wages and makes jobs 
              more scarce especially for people at the bottom of the labor market&mdash;immigrants 
              are 60 percent more likely to be employed in low-skilled occupations 
              than are native-born workers. When the average American wage exceeds 
              the average Mexican wage by more than a factor of ten, even the 
              most menial American job can be a strong reason to emigrate. In 
              addition to driving down wages, immigration adds to the expansion 
              of poverty in the U.S. The gap between the immigrant and native 
              poverty rates is widening&mdash;with poverty among immigrants tripling 
              between 1979 and 1997. If there were a living wage than many of 
              the 15 million unemployed, underemployed and those who have given 
              up looking for employment would be willing to take the jobs that 
              are now often only taken by immigrants. There are two ways to deal 
              with these issues. First, raise the minimum wage to the purchasing 
              power level of 1968 $8 per hour and then, in another two years, 
              raise it to $10 an hour. Since 1968 the U.S. economy has doubled 
              in production per capita. We need to ensure a living wage in the 
              United States for full-time workers and their families. Currently, 
              47 million full-time workers work for less than a living wage. </p>
            <p>Second, we need to enforce the law 
              against employers. It is hard to blame desperately poor people who 
              want to feed their families and are willing to work hard to do so. 
              You have to start with Washington and Wall Street. Enforcement is 
              nearly non-existent&mdash;so much so that it has become a conscious 
              policy to ignore both the labor and immigration laws by successive 
              Republican and Democratic Administrations, including not enforcing 
              laws against cruel sweatshops in the United States from New York 
              City to Los Angeles. Such is the power of employers. </p>
            <p>Immigrant workers, even if they are 
              undocumented, should be given all the fair-labor standards and all 
              the rights and benefits of American workers. In addition they should 
              be be allowed to get a drivers license in order to reduce hazards 
              on the highway and allow them to function in our culture, e.g. get 
              to work, get their children to school. If this country doesn&rsquo;t 
              like that, maybe it will do something about the immigration laws. 
              But we cannot treat undocumented immigrants as subjects for inhumanity. 
              </p>
            <p>Regarding amnesty, this is very difficult 
              issue because it gives a green light to cross the border illegally. 
              Many are concerned with the issue of amnesty because then the question 
              is how do you prevent the next wave and the next? I like the idea 
              of giving workers and children equal rights&mdash;they are working, 
              they are having their taxes withheld, they are performing a valuable 
              service for their employers and customers even though they are illegally 
              here it is humane. There is no alternative except allowing crueler 
              exploitation, poverty, disease and their consequences for the general 
              public. If that produces enough outrage to raise the immigration 
              issue to a high level of visibility for public debate, that would 
              be a good thing. </p>
            <p>There is no evidence that an amnesty 
              for those already present and working constitutes an attraction 
              to would-be immigrants outside the country: again, even from Mexico 
              the immigrants constitute a relatively small percentage of the poor 
              population of that country. We must leave aside the fiction that 
              everyone in the world seeks to live in the United States: people 
              love their s and leave them, at great risk, only as acts of 
              desperation when their previous way of making a living has become 
              impossible. We in the United States have a special responsibility 
              to those who have come here since it so often been our own government 
              and corporations that have ruined the livelihoods and s of immigrant 
              workers, and to those in foreign lands that they will not have to 
              make the same choice themselves. Changing these policies is the 
              best way to limit further immigration to levels that are in the 
              interests of both the U.S. and poor nations, and an amnesty for 
              those who are already here is the least we can do as reparations 
              to those whose lives our government has directly or indirectly wrecked. 
              </p>
            <p>Indeed, in decisions spanning over 
              a century, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution 
              applies to every person within U.S. borders, including &#147;aliens 
              whose presence in this country is unlawful.&#148; On the other hand, 
              the Court has said that the federal government has the power to 
              decide who to let into the country and under what circumstances. 
              But once here, even undocumented immigrants have the right to freedom 
              of speech and religion, the right to be treated fairly, the right 
              to privacy, and some of the other fundamental rights U.S. citizens 
              enjoy. </p>
            <p>Regarding deportation, the U.S. Supreme 
              Court has ruled that the INS may not deport someone without a hearing 
              that satisfies due process. According to the ACLU, most people facing 
              deportation are entitled to: </p>
            <ul>
              <p> 
              <p> 
              &mdash;a hearing before an immigration judge and review, 
                in most cases, by a federal court; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;representation by a lawyer (but not at government 
                expense); </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;reasonable notice of charges, and of a hearing&rsquo;s 
                time and place; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence 
                and the government&rsquo;s witnesses; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;competent interpretation for non-English speaking 
                immigrants, and </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;clear and convincing proof that the government&rsquo;s 
                grounds for deportation are valid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have to control our immigration 
              and our borders. We have to limit the number of people who come 
              into this country illegally and see if a Canadian type temporary 
              permit system can work for seasonal jobs. Regarding &#147;Limited 
              Duration Admissions,&#148; the 1997 report of the U.S. Commission 
              on Immigration Reform said: </p>
            <p>Persons come to the United States 
              for limited duration stays for several principal purposes: representation 
              of a foreign government or other foreign entities; work; study; 
              and short-term visits for commercial or personal purposes, such 
              as tourism and family visits. These individuals are statutorily 
              referred to as &#147;nonimmigrants.&#148; In this report, however, 
              we refer to &#147;limited duration admissions [LDAs],&#148; a term 
              that better captures the nature of their admission: When the original 
              admission expires, the alien must either leave the country or meet 
              the criteria for a new LDA or permanent residence. </p>
            <p>For the most part LDAs help enhance 
              our scientific, cultural, educational, and economic strength. However, 
              the admission of LDAs is not without costs and, as explained below, 
              certain reforms are needed to make the system even more advantageous 
              for the United States than it now is. </p>
            <p>The Commission believes LDA policy 
              should rest on the following principles: </p>
            <ul>
              <p> 
              <p> 
              &mdash;Clear goals and priorities; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;Systematic and comprehensible organization of LDA 
                categories; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;Timeliness, efficiency, and flexibility in its 
                implementation; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;Compliance with the conditions for entry and exit 
                (and effective mechanisms to monitor and enforce this compliance); 
                </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;Credible and realistic policies governing transition 
                from LDA to permanent immigration status; </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;Protection of U.S. workers from unfair competition 
                and of foreign workers from exploitation and abuse; and </li>
              <p> 
              &mdash;Appropriate attention to LDA provisions in trade 
                negotiations to ensure future immigration reforms are not unknowingly 
                foreclosed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Immigration is a challenging issue 
              that must be addressed in a more cohesive way than has been suggested 
              by President Bush. We need to address economic justice in the United 
              States and the world and recognize the basic human rights of all 
              people. </p>
