	<p><i>Dan 
              Damon, BBC, Jul. 13</i></p>
            <p> Mike is a &#147;scambaiter,&#148; 
              dedicated to fighting back against those who send out the notorious 
              419 e-mails, promising untold wealth to anyone gullible or naive 
              enough to disclose their bank details. </p>
            <p>Mike asked us not to use his full 
              name because he&rsquo;s dealing with some heavy cross-border criminals. 
              </p>
            <p>His group of volunteers at 419eater.com 
              use their computer skills to fool the scammers, to disrupt their 
              crimes, and to have some fun at the scammer&rsquo;s expense. </p>
            <p>Every day, millions of people get 
              e-mails like this: </p>
            <dir> 
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir/ Madam, </p>
              <p>I am fine today and how are you? 
                I hope this letter will find you in the best of health. I am Prince 
                Joe Eboh, the Chairman of the &#147;Contract Award Committee&#148;, 
                of the &#147;Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)&#148;, 
                a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). 
                </p>
              <p>NDDC was set up by the late Head 
                of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 18th June 1998, to manage 
                the excess revenue accruing from the sales of Petroleum and its 
                allied products as a domestic increase in the petroleum products 
                to develop the communities in the Niger Delta Oil producing areas. 
                The estimated annual revenue for 1999 was $45 Billion US Dollars 
                &hellip; </p>
            </dir>
            <p>And of course, if you were only willing 
              to help the writer siphon some of it off, a few of those many millions 
              could be yours. </p>
            <p><b>Painted breast</b></p>
            <p>Mike told me how he baited the writer 
              of the e-mail above, Prince Joe Eboh. </p>
            <p>&#147;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s not 
              a prince at all,&#148; Mike says. &#147;He contacted me with a standard 
              419 [so-called after a section of Nigeria&rsquo;s legal code] scam. 
              </p>
            <p>&#147;I tried to turn it round by 
              saying I worked for a church and we couldn&rsquo;t do any business 
              with people who are not of our faith.&#148; </p>
            <p>Mike sent a response in the name of 
              Father Hector Barnett of the Church of the Painted Breast. </p>
            <dir> 
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir, </p>
              <p>I would dearly love to help you. 
                If you ever decide to join our faith then of course I could help 
                you both with my experience and financial support. I wish you 
                well in your endeavour my brother. </p>
              <p>Yours, Father Hector Barnett </p>
            </dir>
            <p>&#147;Now I knew the guy would write 
              back and say: &lsquo;Well, can I join your faith?&rsquo; and indeed 
              he did,&#148; says Mike. </p>
            <dir> 
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Father Hector, </p>
              <p>If joining your faith is what it 
                takes to help me of course, I am ready to join you. I&rsquo;m from 
                a good Christian family. I will do anything you want me to do 
                in the faith. Don&rsquo;t forget that I have to transfer the money 
                to your account as urgently as possible. Send me your account 
                details. I hope to read your mail soon. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Joe, </p>
              <p>Our ministry was founded in 1774 
                by a wonderful lady by the name of Betsy Carrington. She spent 
                many of her first preaching years in Kenya, spreading the holy 
                gospel amongst the local people there. She was the first person 
                male or female to promote Christian texts and beliefs to the Masai 
                warrior tribe. </p>
            </dir>
            <dir> 
              <p>The most famous account is when 
                as a test she had to remove the  part of her clothes and paint 
                the  half of her body and breast with the red Masai war-paint 
                as a gesture of faith and belief to them so that they would accept 
                her and trust her. She was almost immediately accepted by them 
                and was one of the most trusted westerners known at that time. 
                </p>
              <p>As a qualification to enter the 
                Holy Church of The Order of The Red Breast, all followers must 
                go through the initiation procedure that Miss Carrington made 
                so famous. I have attached a photograph of four of our young inductees 
                going through the procedure. </p>
              <p>Please use this picture to enable 
                you to make the same marking on yourself. I have also attached 
                a small picture showing the design in more detail. I look forward 
                to welcoming you into our membership my brother. </p>

            <p><b>&lsquo;Processing fees&rsquo;</b></p>
            <p>Using image software, Mike made up 
              an &#147;initiation&#148; picture. And Prince Joe duly carried out 
              the induction and e-mailed back a photo of himself in the properly 
              sanctified state. </p>

              <p>Dear Brother Hector, </p>
              <p>I want to thank the Almighty God 
                himself for the opportunity I have to be a member of this great 
                church The Holy Church Of The Painted Breast. I&rsquo;m looking 
                forward to establishing a branch of the Church here. But I&rsquo;ll 
                like us to finish everything about the business proposal, which 
                I sent to you earlier &hellip; </p>

            <p>&#147;He then tried to hit me for 
              $18,000 for processing fees for transferring millions,&#148; Mike 
              says. </p>
            <p>He wrote back as Father Hector, saying 
              that the church had plenty of money, but there was a withdrawal 
              fee of $80. </p>
            <p>&#147;I persuaded him to send me the 
              $80, which he did, inside a birthday card, by courier,&#148; Mike 
              says. </p>
            <p>He and his volunteers give any money 
              they get from these reverse stings to a children&rsquo;s charity 
              in the north of England. </p>
            <p><b>Exporting snow</b></p>
            <p>Father Hector of the Church of the 
              Painted Breast then entered a troubling period of religious uncertainty. 
              </p>
            <dir> 
              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Joe, </p>
              <p>This is your good friend Hector 
                Barnett. Please do not be alarmed that I am contacting you from 
                a different e-mail address. I will explain what has happened. 
                </p>
            </dir>
            <dir> 
              <p>I have been troubled recently after 
                the death of a dear friend of mine, Minnie Mowse. She was a very, 
                very dear friend indeed, and her death affected me greatly and 
                started to make me question my faith. I have decided to leave 
                the church and join a travelling circus. </p>
              <p>I have already made two very good 
                friends, and tomorrow I will be starting my circus training with 
                them . . </p>
            </dir>
            <div></div>
            <p>Prince Joe then began receiving e-mails 
              from another &#147;Reverend&#148; of the Church of the Painted Breast 
              worried about the disappearance of Father Hector and $18,000 from 
              church funds. </p>
            <p>Joe already knew from Hector&rsquo;s 
              increasingly eccentric e-mails that he had put the money into a 
              business exporting snow to Siberia. </p>
            <p><b>Lottery winnings</b></p>
            <p>Despite that, Prince Joe still hasn&rsquo;t 
              given up, even though he&rsquo;s $80 down. The e-mail exchange between 
              the probably fake prince and the obviously fake church continues. 
              </p>
            <p>At the same time, the scambaiters 
              are running several other such stings. </p>
            <p>I asked Mike why these people who 
              are themselves scammers can&rsquo;t spot an obvious scam. </p>
            <p>&#147;I think it operates in much 
              the same way as it does with real victims. Greed clouds their judgement. 
              The guy obviously thought he was going to get $18,000 so easily, 
              he was blinded by his own greed. </p>
            <p>&#147;Which is what happens to those 
              who fall for the 419 scams; they just see all these millions.&#148; 
              </p>
            <p>This would all be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t 
              for the millions of dollars being stolen and probably put into drugs 
              or other criminal activities. </p>
            <p>Mike and his friends send all their 
              e-mail exchanges to the police in the UK, Nigeria and to the FBI&mdash;he 
              says they&rsquo;ve had no response. And even warning the victims 
              does no good. Most of them don&rsquo;t want to believe they&rsquo;re 
              being scammed. </p>
            <p>The latest e-mail scam concerns lottery 
              winnings you didn&rsquo;t know you had. </p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re tempted, just remember 
              Prince Joe who&rsquo;s still sending e-mails saying he&rsquo;s sticking 
              to his promise and saying the daily prayer: &#147;When all above 
              seems a great test, Get on down with the Holy Red Breast.&#148; 
              </p>

              <p> 
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Father, </p>
              <p>When I said the prayer this morning, 
                something like a fountain went down my system making me to feel 
                strong &amp; happy. I have spent money to process all the necessary 
                documents for the transfer of this fund. What remains now is the 
                registration of your name as the contractor who executed the contract. 
                </p>
              <p>Yours, Joe. </p>
