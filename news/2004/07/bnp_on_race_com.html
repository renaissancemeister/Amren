<h1>BNP On Race Committee</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><em>Sky News, Jun. 9</em></p>
<p>A decision to appoint a BNP councillor to a committee dedicated to improving race relations has been described as &ldquo;mad&rdquo; by some of its other members. </p>
<p>Adrian Marsden was appointed to the Race Equality and Community Cohesion Working Group of West Yorkshire-based Calderdale Council earlier this week. </p>
<p>Mr Marsden is one of three BNP representative on the unitary Calderdale authority who were re-elected at the recent local elections. </p>
<p>But fellow working party member and deputy leader of the Labour group on the council, councillor Mohammed Najib, said: &ldquo;It is just the biggest joke ever to appoint someone whose policies are racist to a committee aimed at making sure communities are brought together. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is absolutely mad. It is very, very disappointing. We have got to see what we can do about it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He said the decision to appoint Mr Marsden to the eight-person committee was taken by the council&rsquo;s cabinet on Monday after he was nominated by his party. </p>
<p>Conservative council leader John Ford issued a statement saying: &ldquo;In line with council procedure, all party groups were invited to nominate to the working parties, including Race Equality and Community Cohesion. </p>
<p>&ldquo;As a member of this working party Councillor Marsden will be obliged to explain his views and those of his party on race and social cohesion. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If he says anything damaging he will be challenged. Such views will not prevail.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Marsden defended his appointment, saying: &ldquo;We have to have an input. If we didn&rsquo;t, our enemies would use that against us, too. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got a clear idea of how I believe we can bring an end to all the racist stuff there is in Halifax. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The other parties put their members of ethnic minorities on this working party, but surely it should represent the racial make-up of the council. Don&rsquo;t the white people of Calderdale count?&rdquo;</p>
