<h1>Immigrant-Return Plan To Cost $13M</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><em>Knight Ridder Newspapers, Arizona Daily Star, Jun. 30</em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A pilot program to repatriate to the Mexican interior tens of thousands of illegal Mexican entrants will begin in two weeks, land Security Undersecretary Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday. </p>
<p>The pilot program, which runs through Sept. 30, will cost an estimated $13 million to charter planes that land Security officials say will return 300 migrants daily. </p>
<p>The program, approved by Hutchinson earlier this month and known as interior repatriation, is designed to funnel illegal immigrants away from the Arizona-Sonora desert, where punishing heat has killed hundreds, by flying the migrants to Mexico City or Guadalajara and then busing them to their towns. </p>
<p>The agreement caps months of delicate negotiations with Mexico, where the concept of interior repatriation is highly controversial. </p>
<p>Mexican officials insisted that the repatriation be voluntary and that detainees not be handcuffed. </p>
<p>Mexican consular officials will interview the migrants to ensure their decision to fly  is voluntary. </p>
<p>By returning the migrants to southern Mexico &mdash; the departure point for an estimated 70 percent of all would-be crossers &mdash; U.S. officials are hoping to save lives and make it harder for migrants to return by breaking their relationship with the smuggling rings that have become an essential means of getting across the border. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, we are repatriating them across the border, and it simply puts them back in the hands of the smuggling organization,&rdquo; Hutchinson told reporters. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see them in the next day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Though the land Security Department has yet to hire an airline, the first flight is expected July 12 out of Tucson. </p>

<p> <br>
From: anon college student</p>
<p>Mexicans think they should consent to leaving? But when did Americans get to approve their illegal arrival?<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
 <br>
 <br>
From: Mestizus</p>
<p>The Immigrant-Return Program is absolute nonsense, just another smokescreen by the mutants in Washington to make it look like they are actually doing something about the border crisis.</p>
<p>The surprising part of the agreement is that the Mexican government, as agressive a beggar and bandit operation as a street-corner extortionist like Jesse Jackson, is not providing the charter transportation as the hinge of this deal in order to pocket the initial 13M available as some sort of reward for its humanitarian efforts on behalf of those people whom it despises and consistently excludes from the national economy.</p>
<p>However, it may be that who benefits financially will come out in due course. The money allocated for this program is a pittance relative to the huge costs involved in serious repatriation.</p>
<p>Asa Hutchinson, who prosecuted the bogus War on Drugs, is the ideal federal mutant to lead land Security in the same direction, extracting billions in tax appropriations and producing nothing but congealed smoke.</p>
<p>Between him and Ridge, there are not enough brains to bait a fishhook. They both need to be shortened by a head, as the Russians say.</p>
<p>As for the governance of Mexico, the student body government of any decent high school in Seattle, St. Louis, Chatanooga, or a myriad of other locations could straighten out Mexico in a relatively short time.</p>
<p>The problem in Mexico and its facsimiles in the Western Hemisphere starts at the, not with the people, who could perform at a much higher level without the true &#8220;Mexican Mafia,&#8221; in the Federal District. One may observe that the United States government has become a problem since the 60s for the nation just as the Mexican government has always been a problem for its people, which explains the third-worldization in the US that will eventually equalize the two countries if the current crisis continues for much longer.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Casey Crews</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexican officials insisted that the repatriation be voluntary and that detainees not be handcuffed.&#8221; These people illegally invaded our country and now their leaders are saying we cannot remove them without their permission. How ludicrous and galling is that?! Mexico has absolutely no right to tell us how to run any affairs in our country much less tell us we can&rsquo;t deport the illegals without their consent. If this is not an invasion of our sovereignty, what is? Why don&rsquo;t we just go ahead and make Fox the president of the U.S. and be done with it. <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Karl</p>
<p>These types of programs always start out slow and bumpy-it will improve.</p>
<p>Hand cuffs or no, the important thing is that they are being kicked out. This is a positive step.</p>
<p>$13 million spent to get them out is a great investment. It means that $13 million won&rsquo;t be used to settle some bunch on non-white refugees who will turn on us the moment they can. A small amount of law enforcement means that there will be more self-deportations in the future.<br>
 </p>

From: Drew</p>
<p>I would love to see an impenetrable wall along the southern border. I do not care how much it would cost. We spend a billion or more dollars for one stealth bomber so I imagine we can spend the money to build a fence.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: James Beam</p>
<p>from Mestizus: &#8220;The problem in Mexico and its facsimiles in the Western Hemisphere starts at the, not with the people.&#8221; Would you be willing to bet your life on that assertion?<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Mestizus</p>
<p>Concerning Casey Crews&rsquo;s comment about making Fox the president of the US, I have suggested in various forums that there be a massive write-in campaign for Fox as president and Bush as vice-president to reflect the reality that the federal system of the United States is now not only horizontal, as originally envisioned, but also vertical due to the constant meddling of the last two Mexican administrations, Zedillo and Fox.</p>
<p>Such a campaign would highlight the current confusion of sovereignty, or simply, Who&rsquo;s on first? It would also publicize a heretofore unknown political power play wherein one nation, and by far a weaker one, exercises sovereignty in a neighboring, more powerful nation.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see how many votes Fox could pull.</p>
<p>As for James Beam&rsquo;s question of betting my life on the average Mexican or Mestizo, it is not really relevant since I am discussing the major source of problems in &#8220;Latin&#8221; America. If he is talking about the criminality of individuals, he is right, it is a big problem, which is probably partially genetic and partially cultural in nature.</p>
<p>Also, a major improvement in the region would come from the elimination of the Spanish and Portuguese languages and their attendant cultures because they are living dead languages. They do not work in the world today  &mdash;  they are either too elliptical or too eloquent to mesh with reality, which is why there are so few Nobel prize winners in the sciences and economics and more than a few winners in Literature. This language problem also corresponds to their habit of thinking that words are deeds, its own destructive fiction.</p>
<p>A more direct answer to Mr. Beam is that I have spent ten years primarily in Lima and San Salvador, so I guess I have bet my life on living with the Mestizos. They may get me one of these days, but then I would not be too thrilled with living in DC or Oakland with their vast criminal, negroid components.<br>

<p> <br>
From: Sigurd</p>
<p>A nation is its people. The problem with Mexico is Mexicans. <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Dave </p>
<p>What we need to ask ourselves is, what makes a Mexican want to go back to Mexico? Once we understand the reasons and thresholds that cause them to want to go back, we will be in a better position to &#8220;help&#8221; them. <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Sigurd </p>
<p>That Mexicans do not want to live in Mexico is of no concern to us. Since when are we responsible for the standard of living in Mexico or the relative happiness of Mexicans? The only way to prevent Mexicans from entering the US is by &#8220;preventing&#8221; them from entering the US-not by impoverishing our country in some effort to &#8220;improve&#8221; their country-as any such effort would require.</p>
<p>I think Americans have become terrified of confrontation-terrified of hurting feelings-but they better buck up and stand their ground, or soon they will we have no ground upon which to stand.<br>
