<h1>PLF Wins Landmark Court Ruling</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pacific Legal Foundation, Jul. 27</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>San Francisco,CA: The Pacific Legal Foundation today won a landmark legal victory on behalf of race and sex equality for all Californians. The state trial court has ruled in the consolidated cases of <em>Schram Construction, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco</em> and <em>Coral Construction, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco</em> that San Francisco&rsquo;s public contracting program granting preferences to minority- and women-owned businesses violates the California Constitution. </p>
<p>PLF filed the <em>Coral Construction </em>lawsuit in September, 2000, and the <em>Schram Construction </em>suit in June 2003. These lawsuits challenge San Francisco&rsquo;s public contracting program that calculates bids submitted by minority- and women-owned businesses at 10 percent lower than the bid price. Bidders must also show that they will use a certain percentage of minority and women subcontractors to work on the project, as well as requires City agencies to give special notice to minority- and women-owned businesses of upcoming bidding opportunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voters of California spoke loudly to end racially-driven programs and policies like those used in San Francisco. I am heartened that the court saw the issues clearly and handed down this victory for equality,&rdquo; said PLF attorney Sharon Browne, representing Schram Construction. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased with the Court&rsquo;s decision to enforce Proposition 209 against the City&rsquo;s entrenched discriminatory program,&rdquo; said Browne. &ldquo;This decision was a straight forward application of Proposition 209 to the same type of government preference program that the California Supreme Court ruled violated Proposition 209 back in 2000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;San Francisco officials have defied the California constitution ever since Prop 209 was passed eight years ago. With this decision, City officials will have to end these discriminatory program,&rdquo; added John Findley, the PLF attorney representing Coral Construction. </p>
<p>Since 1984, San Francisco has been enforcing a series of public contracting ordinances that grant preferential treatment to minority- and women-owned businesses. Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative enacted in November 1996, amended the California Constitution to make it illegal for state and local governments to &ldquo;discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individuals or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public contracting.&rdquo; Although San Francisco&rsquo;s public contracting program was set to expire in June 2003, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors extended its illegal race- and sex-based public contracting program to 2008.</p>
<p>Richard D. Schram is the president and sole owner of Schram Construction. Since 1998, Schram Construction has been bidding on San Francisco&rsquo;s public works contracts. Coral Construction is headquartered in Oregon and performs a large percentage of its work in California as a specialty highway contractor.</p>
<p>PLF has been the primary enforcer of Proposition 209 since its passage. In 2000, PLF won a landmark victory against the city of San Jose in <em>Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose</em>, the first Proposition 209 enforcement case to reach the California Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Under its own local ordinance, the City of San Jose required bidders for city contracts to either hire minority or women subcontractors or engage in &ldquo;outreach&rdquo; to minority- and women-owned subcontractors, exclusively. Hi-Voltage intended to perform all of the work itself rather than subcontract, and its bid was rejected even though it had the lowest bid price. In a resounding, unanimous judgment, the state Supreme Court struck down the San Jose affirmative action program, setting a clear legal precedent that the state constitution makes it unlawful for state and local governments to favor one group over another in public contracting.</p>
