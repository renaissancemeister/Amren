						<p><em>Günther Nonnenmacher, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jul. 2</em></p>
<p>The tests Turkey supposedly must pass on its way to becoming a full member of the European Union have become a farce. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder already knows that Turkey will get good grades in the progress report that the EU Commission plans to issue in October &mdash; thanks to Günter Verheugen, the Commission member who is responsible for enlargement and who plays a pivotal role in this matter. </p>
<p>So with the cat out of the bag, Schröder has already said he will support opening accession negotiations with Turkey when the European Council votes on the issue in December. Germany has leaned in this direction for quite some time. The stance is based on geopolitical considerations and a set of hopes cloaked in political-cultural rhetoric that cannot be assessed anyway. </p>
<p>Even French President Jacques Chirac, who in the past has criticized U.S. President George Bush for demanding speedy Turkish membership, threw his weight behind paving the way for Turkish accession. But when viewpoints are already set in stone, it is hard to understand the reasoning behind the whole reporting theater. </p>
<p>Those in the EU who are skeptical about Turkey&rsquo;s membership &mdash; and they are out there &mdash; do not dare state their views openly. The geographical argument no longer holds water. And it is no longer politically correct to demand an EU with a modicum of homogeneity amid all of the diversity, a European Union that possesses an identity to which its citizens can relate and has the power to act. Even the last naysayers fell silent after Turkey&rsquo;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, hinted at what could happen to his country if Turkey were rebuked. </p>
<p>So the EU, which began integrating 10 new members in May, is sliding into the next adventure with its eyes wide open. And all this is taking place against the backdrop of two major events: the European Parliament elections last month at which voters expressed their growing unease and the EU leaders&rsquo; Herculean effort to find a new Commission president. Well, Schröder said he wanted to give the new candidate a chance. We can only hope that Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso receives a few more heartfelt words of congratulations.</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the geographical argument hold any water then? Turkey isn&rsquo;t in Europe, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be in the European Union. I was all for the EU until all this talk about Turkey joining. EU should be a union of european peoples. Non-whites are only assimible in small numbers. The free flow of people from a country the size of Turkey is not only a demographic disaster waiting to happen, but will damage the EU considerably in terms of European solidarity.<br>

<p>There are many real problems with admitting Turkey to the EU. The two that seem most pressing to me are Tukey&rsquo;s lack of real control over its borders, and Turkey&rsquo;s Economy. First Turkey&rsquo;s loose borders could provide an easy avenue for terrorists to travel to Europe (and already does by some accounts). And Second Turkey&rsquo;s poor economic environment will push the population (68,000,000)out of the country to flood the rest of Europe (read Germany and France) with Turks. The unemployment rate is officially 11.3% but has been estimated by the US Government to be around 25%. On a personal note: I grow sad when I think about the beautiful, safe cities of Europe becoming more and more like our U.S. cities. The last time I visited Paris we were told that there were areas of the city we should not go.<br>

<p>tjefferson, I agree fully. European cities are very charming and cultural unlike American cities. I have been to some cities in Germany that look like they could be taken right out of a fairy tale, with their beautiful medieval style houses and their cobble stone streets that are polished so clean that you could probably eat off of them. I noticed over there that people walk to go to the store or to a restaurant, instead of getting on a highway and driving up to 20 miles to go somewhere, like here in the U.S. It is just such a safe and relaxing atmosphere, and I don&rsquo;t want it to be challenged with third world hordes. I can say the same about the country side. I don&rsquo;t ever want my grandchildren to live only to see the beautiful green mountains of Germany and Switzerland turned into mudslides since third worlders don&rsquo;t know how to grow grass, as I&rsquo;ve noticed. <br>

<p>I cannot believe the French and German people want this. Indeed, most French and German friends I know are already worried. I suppose this should come as no surprise: their governments are no more representative than Brit and US governments.<br>

From: jr</p>
<p>I share people&rsquo;s dread that Muslim Turks will flood into every White European city. George Dubya Bush is a complete moron, he has no clue. That said, I suggest WN enjoy some good with the bad. I have travelled in France many times since I graduated collect 20 years ago, it is never a better time to be a White American travelling there. Just make a good faith effot to speak some French, smile at the White French faces who have to work amidst all the Arab Muslims and pay with cash plus an American sized tip. The local White French will really like you, recognize you for what you are: a distant relative. All Whites everywhere are a family in grave danger, let&rsquo;s love our own people and forever end the petty squables over language, past wars.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Billy B</p>
<p>I am British, but spend much of my time in Germany and intend to settle there in the near future. Germany has an unfortunate number of Turk residents and I can assure President Bush that they are not European. Their culture is completely alien and they are responsible for the vast majority of crime in many parts of Germany. They are arrogant and despise German culture, which most people would admit is a bit rich. My own partner was gang-raped by Turks, a sadly common occurrence which is due to their attitude towards white women. Admitting Turkey to the EU would just mean the whole continent is overrun by them. No thanks. They can cuddle up to Israel, and leave us alone.<br>
