						<p><em>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, Jun. 3</em></p>
<p>A Department of land Security official, who last week criticized the arrest of 420 illegal aliens at inland locations in Southern California, yesterday told California lawmakers the department would consider the &ldquo;sensitivities&rdquo; of interior enforcement when making similar arrests in the future. </p>
<p>&ldquo;While the DHS must prevent terrorists and instruments of terrorism from entering the United States, we must also enforce the immigration laws of the United States,&rdquo; said Undersecretary Asa Hutchinson in a letter yesterday to Rep. Joe Baca, California Democrat, one of several members of the California delegation who complained about the arrests. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you that we will enforce these laws in a reasonable manner and will consider the sensitivities associated with interior enforcement of our immigration laws,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Mr. Hutchinson, in the letter, said that while the arrests were &ldquo;within their legal authority,&rdquo; he confirmed that they had not been approved in advance by officials in Washington, D.C., and violated long-standing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policy. It gives the Border Patrol what he called a &ldquo;clear border nexus&rdquo; that allows the agency to deal with &ldquo;recent arrivals to the United States.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The illegal aliens were arrested at public locations in inland Southern California communities over a two-week period beginning June 4 &mdash; taken into custody by a 12-member team known as the Mobile Patrol Group. Law-enforcement authorities said the arrests came as a result of intelligence operations that identified locations where suspected illegal aliens were believed to gather. </p>
<p>Much of the information, authorities said, came from local residents and state and local police. The team had targeted the aliens at public sites, including bus ss, in a 3,000-square-mile area of Southern California. Some of the arrests were made 100 miles north of the U.S.-Mexican border. </p>
<p>Mr. Baca, along with other members of the California delegation, met last week with Mr. Hutchinson to complain that the Border Patrol had &ldquo;outstepped its jurisdiction&rdquo; in the arrests. He described the aliens as victims of racial profiling and said the arrests had caused panic in the Hispanic community. </p>
<p>In a statement last week, Mr. Baca said Mr. Hutchinson &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; the immigration sweeps should have been coordinated through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which now oversees the interior enforcement of the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws, and promised to review the matter. </p>
<p>Mr. Baca said Mr. Hutchinson told lawmakers that because most of the aliens involved had resided and worked in the United States for over a year, ICE should have handled the enforcement. </p>
<p>While Mr. Hutchinson said in the letter that immigration enforcement in the nation&rsquo;s interior is the responsibility of ICE, officials at that agency have acknowledged that they lack the manpower and resources to target out-of-status aliens now living and working in the United States &mdash; estimated at between 8 million and 12 million. </p>
<p>Instead, ICE has focused on the ongoing apprehension of 80,000 criminal aliens in this country and 320,000 &ldquo;absconders,&rdquo; those foreign nationals who were ordered deported, but disappeared. </p>
<p>Last week, CBP Commissioner Robert C. Bonner said the Southern California arrests were legal and within the Border Patrol&rsquo;s jurisdiction, adding that the agency would &ldquo;do whatever is necessary to control our nation&rsquo;s borders.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Bonner said the patrol was &ldquo;legally entitled to interdict and apprehend individuals illegally in the United States&rdquo; and, in the future, &ldquo;purely interior enforcement operations&rdquo; by the Border Patrol would be approved at CBP headquarters. </p>
<p>Mr. Hutchinson had been expected to deliver his review in person, but took part yesterday in graduation ceremonies for the Federal Air Marshal Service in Atlantic City, N.J. </p>

<p>Comrade Asa is building his golden parachute for a position in the Aztlan Department of Reconquista Security.</p>
<p>Hutchinson has to grovel at the feet of some Aztlan traitor about enforcing law that provides for a &#8220;common defense&#8221; of the nation&rsquo;s border. Joe Sobran is right, we live in the Post-Constitutional age.</p>
<p>Like I have stated before&hellip;Aztlan is a done deal.<br>
 </p>

From: Drew</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m way sick and tired of this &#8220;we need to be sensitive to the needs of the illegal aliens and the Hispanics.&#8221; What about the sensitivities of the regular American citizens! <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: John P. M.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;out-of-status aliens now living and working in the United States  &mdash;  estimated at between 8 million and 12 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the population size of a small country, for example : Austria 8,131,111; Belarus 10,366,719; or Cambodia 12,212,306(Time Almanac 2001, pgs. 726, 730, and 740.) So there are 8 to 12 million jobs, that native born Americans will not take that are being filled? There is of course no social costs to such &#8220;diversity&#8221;? A whole country within a country, can only be a strength, not a drain? History will not record this era as &#8216;The Age of American Stupidity and Madness&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;I wonder!<br>
