						<p><em>Jimmy Moore, Talon News, Jun. 30</em></p>
<p><br>
WASHINGTON (Talon News) &mdash; Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL) has introduced a bill into the U.S. House of Representatives that would help curb voting fraud by requiring voters to provide photo identification when voting in federal elections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Federal Election Integrity Act of 2004,&rdquo; or H.R. 4530, would specifically amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the Motor Voter law, to require any individual who desires to register or re-register to vote in an election for federal office to provide the state election official with proof of citizenship to prevent illegal aliens from voting in federal elections.</p>
<p>Forms of identification that can be used include a U.S. birth certificate, a naturalization card, or a U.S. passport. Supporters of the Hyde bill are hoping it will pass so it will become law before the November elections.</p>
<p>Defending his legislation, Hyde said this issue is about ensuring that the only people voting in federal elections are legal citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. Constitution clearly states that only U.S. citizens may vote in federal elections,&rdquo; Hyde commented at a press conference. &ldquo;My bill would amend the 1993 Motor Voter bill to require states to demand proof of citizenship when a person applies for voter registration, even if they have previously been on the voter rolls at another location. There will be no exceptions. My bill also would require photo I.D. to be presented when registering to vote or voting at the polls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proponents of the Hyde bill say the Moter Voter law, which was heralded by former President Bill Clinton as one of the crowning achievements of his administration, has made it too easy for non-citizens to be registered to vote illegally. Some states with large populations of illegal aliens, such as Illinois and California, are registering them to vote because they are not required to show proof of citizenship.</p>
<p>However, the Hyde bill would mandate that states see proof of citizenship when registering people to vote, including inspecting and verifying all documents that prove the individual is a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>In fact, this law would even apply to those states that allow people to register at the polls as well as states that do not require voter registration. The Hyde bill would require a photo identification to be shown prior to voting in a federal election.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Federal Election Integrity Act of 2004&rdquo; has 6 co-sponsors, including Rep. Steve Buyer (R-IN), Rep. Phil English (R-PA), Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Rep. Virgil Goode (R-VA), Rep. Sam Johnson (R-TX), and Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-CO) and is currently under consideration by the House Administration Committee.</p>

<p>Why is this even an issue? What other country is so stupid that it would let noncitizens vote? I certainly can&rsquo;t think of one nonwhite country that would do so. Keeping illegal aliens from voting? Oh my gosh&hellip;.how racist!<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>

From: Kweli</p>
<p>So pray tell, whose side are you going to come down on when White patriot groups object to having to prove citizenship? (And they should, if they are true to their cause)</p>
<p>Believe it or not, being White doesn&rsquo;t make one a Citizen of this USA.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>

From: Sigurd </p>
<p>Kweli,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to understand your comment, but I think it has something to do with applying different standards to white conduct vs. non-white conduct. If for example whites were, like non-whites, entering the country illegally and illegally voting (which they are not) then this should be seen as equally egregious.</p>
<p>From an &#8220;equality&#8221; perspective I would agree that this would be equally egregious and certainly equally illegal, but from a group survival perspective, the perspective from which every racial group save whites views the world (the only sound perspective), I would say that when non-whites flood in and vote illegally it is terrible, whereas if whites were to do it, it would be fantastic.</p>
<p>Non-whites have had a relativist&rsquo;s view of what&rsquo;s right and wrong, they&rsquo;ve believed themselves a privileged class, one &#8220;morally&#8221; entitled to jobs over &#8220;racist&#8221; whites and now it&rsquo;s time for whites to adopt a similar attitude.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Invictus</p>
<p>Kweli,</p>
<p>Can you give me an example of any &#8220;white patriot group&#8221; that has suggested whites shouldn&rsquo;t have to prove citizenship to vote? On the slim chance that any were so silly as to make this suggestion, do you think anyone would take it seriously? No, the press would pounce on it as an example of lunatic racism.</p>
<p>We have real problems to deal with on this site, and we don&rsquo;t need to waste our time discussing such remote hypotheses.<br>
 </p>

From: In Occupied L.A. </p>
<p>Kweli is disingenuous at best. Since the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, about 10% of immigrants have come from Europe. The numbers of white immigrants, legal and illegal are miniscule when compared to the flood of low IQ third world nation wreckers that have poured into the US illegally, never mind &#8220;legally&#8221;. Of course, most whites would have little trouble proving citizenship while the majority of &#8220;hispanics&#8221; would be in the opposite corner, never mind other non-whites. It&rsquo;s all moot however. Kweli and others show their hypocrisy by staying in the US. A country built on the backs of whites, using white imagination, ingenuity, and dynamism. Despite all PC claims to the contrary, blacks and hispanics have contributed very little to the development of the US, unless we are speaking about its decay. When it comes to destruction of society, these people are experts. They&rsquo;ll complain about whites, but they stay in the US to live off white progress and ingenuity. Not to mention white taxpayers. <br>

<p> <br>
From: Casey Crews </p>
<p>Wait a minute&hellip;according to the Deseret Morning News editorial a few weeks back, illegals don&rsquo;t have the time or motivation to vote therefore when NumbersUSA called for monitoring the polls they said that the only reason for that action would be to &#8220;intimidate&#8221; legal voters. I think I&rsquo;ll e-mail them a copy of this report and ask them to apologize for their slanderous remarks. According to this article illegals are being registered to vote.<br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: Drew </p>
<p>I understand that using illegal aliens is one of the Democrats favorite methods for stealing elections. <br>
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
From: D.B. Yankton </p>
<p>Write your congressman and support this bill.<br>

<p>This is why even Stupid Party flacks like Rush Limbaugh could see the hidden Treason Party agenda within this Motor Voter evil scam. In PA you go to get a drivers license and they want to see a birth certificate and a utility bill. Are these somehow reliable proof of citizenship? And this is after September 11th, 2001, and in response to it. Big deal. Like this is going to s these jehadist trained agents from getting ID. Or the Mexicans. Hasn&rsquo;t the press reported of a cottage industry in phony documents? Automatic voter registration allows anti-white (or more acurately, white-hating) usurpers and invaders (illegal alliens) to corrupt or really essentially overthrow U.S. elections. The looney and treasonous white left and their swarthy allies love it. It is the permanent solidification of their illegitimate power, in a Latin American style, white minority-rule future of their sick dreams.The Motor Voter law needs eradication, not reform.</p>
