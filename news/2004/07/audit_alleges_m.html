<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>For four years, the African-American Mentor Program Inc. grew fast, attracting up to 500 St. Paul youths a year looking for a role model to help steer them in the right direction.</p>
<p>But when the nonprofit, statesupported program shut down in 2002, its finances were in question and its books were soon referred for an audit.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a report from the Minnesota legislative auditor&rsquo;s office concluded that Duane Dutrieuille, the former executive director, misused $90,000 in state funds for things like a lease on a Dodge Durango, a new house and pay bonuses that he gave himself.</p>
<p>Dutrieuille, a special-education teacher at St. Paul&rsquo;s Central High School, launched the nonprofit organization in 1997. Contacted Wednesday, he said he hasn&rsquo;t seen the auditor&rsquo;s report but defended his management of the mentoring program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I explained to them what the money was used for,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In a letter accompanying the report, Legislative Auditor James Nobles said his office has referred the report to the Ramsey County attorney&rsquo;s office for possible criminal charges. Dutrieuille said Wednesday he hadn&rsquo;t heard of that possibility.</p>
<p>The report also was sent to the state attorney general&rsquo;s office, which could try to recover the funds allegedly misused.</p>
<p>From 1998 through 2002, the state awarded almost $2 million in grants to the African-American Mentor Program, which amounted to about 75 percent of the program&rsquo;s total funding. The rest came from gifts, grants from private sources and bank loans.</p>
<p>Dutrieuille said Wednesday the Durango was used for program-related purposes. He also said the board of directors was informed of bonuses given to staff, but added, &ldquo;the board pretty much allowed me to run the business the way I felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The auditor&rsquo;s report was critical of the lack of oversight in the organization, saying the board &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t establish guidelines to control the organization&rsquo;s financial operation or its expenditure of funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked for the names of former board members Wednesday, Dutrieuille declined.</p>
<p>According to a Form 990 filed with the Internal Revenue Service in 2000, the African-American Mentor Program had four board members besides Dutrieuille, including Phyllis Braxton, who had run a teen pregnancy prevention program in St. Paul.</p>
<p>Reached Wednesday, Braxton said she knew Dutrieuille and did agree verbally in the late 1990s to be on the mentoring program&rsquo;s board. But she never received any follow-up information, never served on the board and never attended any meetings.</p>
<p>The auditor&rsquo;s report also criticized the state&rsquo;s Education Department for not properly monitoring the organization&rsquo;s use of the state grant funds.</p>
<p>The investigation of the mentor program started with a tip to the Education Department in 2002. A visit by department staff showed a lack of proper recordkeeping, and the legislative auditor was asked to investigate.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Deputy Education Commissioner Chas Anderson said the department already has tightened its monitoring of state and federal funds.</p>
<p>The Rev. Devin Miller, who is president of the Life Skills Development Center in St. Paul, partnered with Dutrieuille&rsquo;s program at one point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The program in and of itself was a good program,&rdquo; Miller said. &ldquo;It did work with not just high achievers, but those kids who were hard to reach.&rdquo; That included kids in elementary through high school grades, as well as referrals that came from the court system for kids who could benefit from good role models.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the most part,&rdquo; Miller said, the mentoring program &ldquo;grew too big, too fast.&rdquo; He added that he doesn&rsquo;t fault Dutrieuille for what happened. &ldquo;The heart was in the right place, but the management skills were not.&rdquo;</p>
