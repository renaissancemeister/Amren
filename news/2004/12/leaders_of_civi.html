<h1><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20041201/pl_nm/politics_rights_dc_4">Leaders of Civil-Rights Watchdog Blast Bush</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Elsner, Reuters, Dec. 1</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &mdash; Leaders of a divided federal civil-rights watchdog agency accused President Bush of deepening racial divisions, in a parting shot after years of sparring with his administration.</p>
<p>Mary Frances Berry, chairperson of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and Vice Chairperson Cruz Reynoso delivered a 166-page report to the White House harshly criticizing the administration for setting back race relations and failing to promote civil rights in any meaningful way. </p>
<p>But the report is not an official document, because four of the eight commissioners, all of them Republican appointees, voted against adopting it and rejected the charges as politically biased. </p>
<p>Both Berry and Reynoso are due to retire from the commission next month at the end of their six-year terms, giving Bush the chance to appoint their successors and shape a body more supportive of his policies. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadly, the spiraling demise of hope for social justice and healing has deepened over the past four years, largely due to a departure from and marginalization of long-established civil rights priorities, practices and laws,&rdquo; Berry and Reynoso wrote in a letter to Bush. </p>
<p>Peter Kirsanow, one of the four commissioners who voted against the report, said it was politically slanted, and based on shoddy research and faulty analysis. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It started from the premise that the Bush administration was not sufficiently enforcing civil-rights law. When we examined it closely, we found it was deeply flawed in respect to its information, analysis and conclusions,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>The White House said it would not comment on the content of the report because it was not an official commission document. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be two vacancies come Jan. 5 and the President will move quickly to appoint two individuals who share his strong commitment to uphold civil rights for all Americans,&rdquo; said spokeswoman Erin Healy. </p>
<p>LAST GASP REPORT </p>
<p>A commission official said the newest report was effectively a last gasp, since Bush would be able to put his own appointee in charge. Berry is independent and Reynoso is a Democrat, and there are two other Democrats on the panel. </p>
<p>In the past four years, the panel has been a thorn in the administration&rsquo;s side, issuing several reports on voter fraud and the alleged suppression of minority votes in the 2000 presidential election. </p>
<p>The commission had also refused to seat Kirsanow after Bush appointed him in 2001, but a federal appeals court ruled against the panel&rsquo;s challenge. </p>
<p>The commission investigates civil-rights complaints and issues reports, but it has no enforcement powers. Its members are appointed, four by the White House and four by Congress. </p>
<p>The commission now has three Republicans and another independent, and it can have no more than four members of the same political party. </p>
<p>The report said Bush had not presented a focused civil rights agenda, and his public statements showed his commitment to the issue was limited. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not speak frequently about civil rights policies, and usually when he does, it is in reference to his faith-based initiative, which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. actually erodes such rights. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to place no value on including civil-rights leaders in policy discussions or soliciting input from anyone other than his own close circles, and even then only those who share his views,&rdquo; the report said.<br>
