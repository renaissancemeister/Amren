						<blockquote>&#8220;For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary,
or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member
called upon to make a political or ethical judgment should be able to spray
forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying out
bullets.&#8221;
<p>–&nbsp; George Orwell, <i>1984</i></blockquote>
<p><font size="+3"><font color="#000099">N</font></font>o successful society shows a spontaneous tendency
towards multiculturalism or multiracialism. Successful and enduring
societies show a high degree of homogeneity. Those who support multiculturalism
either do not know this or, what is more likely, realize that if they are
to transform Western societies into strictly regulated, racial-feminist
bureaucracies they must first undermine those societies.
<p>This transformation is as radical and revolutionary as the project to
establish Communism in the Soviet Union. Just as every aspect of life had
to be brought under political control in order for the commissars to impose
their vision of society, the multiculturalists hope to control and dominate
every aspect of our lives. Unlike the hard tyranny of the Soviets, theirs
is a softer, gentler tyranny but one with which they hope to bind us as
tightly as a prisoner in the Gulag. Today&rsquo;s &#8220;political correctness&#8221; is
the direct descendent of Communist terror and brainwashing.
<p>Unlike the obviously alien implantation that was Communism, what makes
multiculturalism particularly insidious and difficult to combat is that
it usurps the moral and intellectual infrastructure of the West. Although
it claims to champion the deepest held beliefs of the West, it is in fact
a perversion and systematic undermining of the very idea of the West.

What we call &#8220;political correctness&#8221; actually dates back to the Soviet
Union of the 1920s (<i>politicheskaya pravil&rsquo;nost&rsquo;</i> in Russian), and
was the extension of political control to education, psychiatry, ethics,
and behavior. It was an essential component of the attempt to make sure
all aspects of life were consistent with ideological orthodoxy – which
is the distinctive feature of all totalitarianisms. In the post-Stalin
period, political correctness even meant that dissent was seen as a symptom
of mental illness, for which the only treatment was incarceration.
<p>As Mao Tse-Tung, the Great Helmsman, put it, &#8220;Not to have a correct
political orientation is like not having a soul.&#8221; Mao&rsquo;s little red book
is full of exhortations to follow the correct path of Communist thought,
and by the late 1960s Maoist political correctness was well established
in American universities. The final stage of development, which we are
witnessing now, is the result of cross-fertilization with all the latest
&#8220;isms:&#8221; anti-racism, feminism, structuralism, and post-modernism, which
now dominate university curricula. The result is a new and virulent strain
of totalitarianism, whose parallels to the Communist era are obvious. Today&rsquo;s
dogmas have led to rigid requirements of language, thought, and behavior,
and violators are treated as if they were mentally unbalanced, just as
Soviet dissidents were.

<p>Some have argued that it is unfair to describe Stalin&rsquo;s regime as &#8220;totalitarian,&#8221;
pointing out that one man, no matter how ruthlessly he exercised power,
could not control all the functions of the state. But, in fact, he didn&rsquo;t
have to. Totalitarianism was much more than state terror, censorship, and
concentration camps; it was a state of mind in which the very idea of a
private opinion or point of view had been destroyed. The totalitarian propagandist
forces people to believe that slavery is freedom, squalor is bounty, ignorance
is knowledge, and that a rigidly closed society is the most open in the
world. And once enough people are made to think this way, it is functionally
totalitarian even if a single dictator does not personally control everything.
<p>Today, of course, we are made to believe that diversity is strength,
perversity is virtue, success is oppression, and that relentlessly repeating
these ideas over and over is &#8220;tolerance and diversity.&#8221; Indeed, the multicultural
revolution works subversion everywhere, just as Communist revolutions did:
judicial activism undermines the rule of law; &#8220;tolerance&#8221; weakens the conditions
that make real tolerance possible; universities, which should be havens
of free inquiry, practice censorship that rivals that of the Soviets. At
the same time, we find a relentless drive for equality: the Bible, Shakespeare,
and rap &#8220;music&#8221; are just texts with &#8220;equally valid perspectives;&#8221; deviant
and criminal behavior is an &#8220;alternative life-style.&#8221; Today, Dostoevsky&rsquo;s
<i>Crime and Punishment</i> would have to be repackaged as <i>Crime and
Counseling</i>.
<p>In the Communist era, the totalitarian state was built on violence.
The purges of the 1930s and the Great Terror (which was Mao&rsquo;s model for
the Cultural Revolution) used violence against &#8220;class enemies&#8221; to compel
loyalty. Party members signed death warrants for &#8220;enemies of the people&#8221;
knowing that the accused were innocent, but believing in the correctness
of the charges. In the 1930s, <i>collective</i> guilt justified murdering
millions of Russian peasants. As cited by Robert Conquest in <i>The Harvest
of Sorrow</i> (p. 143), the state&rsquo;s view of this class was, &#8220;not one of
them was guilty of anything; but they belonged to a class that was guilty
of everything.&#8221; Stigmatizing entire institutions and groups makes it much
easier to carry out wholesale change.

This, of course, is the beauty of &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;sexism&#8221; for today&rsquo;s
culture attackers – sin can be extended far beyond individuals to include
institutions, literature, language, history, laws, customs, entire civilizations.
The charge of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; is no different from declaring an
entire economic class an enemy of the people. &#8220;Racism&#8221; and &#8220;sexism&#8221; are
multiculturalism&rsquo;s assault weapons, its Big Ideas, just as class warfare
was for Communists, and the effects are the same. If a crime can be collectivized
all can be guilty because they belong to the wrong group. When young whites
are victims of racial preferences they are to-day&rsquo;s version of the Russian
peasants. Even if they themselves have never oppressed anyone they &#8220;belong
to the race that is guilty of everything.&#8221;
<p>The purpose of these multi-cultural campaigns is to destroy the self.
The mouth moves, the right gestures follow, but they are the mouth and
gestures of a zombie, the new Soviet man or, today, PC-man. And once enough
people have been conditioned this way, <i>violence is no longer necessary</i>.
We reach steady-state totalitarianism, in which the vast majority know
what is expected of them and play their allotted roles.&nbsp;
<p>The Russian experiment with revolution and totalitarian social engineering
has been fully chronicled by two of that country&rsquo;s greatest writers, Dostoevsky
and Solzhenitsyn. They brilliantly dissect the methods and psychology of
totalitarian control. Dostoevsky&rsquo;s <i>The Devils</i> has no equal as a
penetrating and disturbing analysis of the revolutionary and utopian mind.
The &#8220;devils&#8221; are radical students of the middle and upper classes flirting
with something they do not understand. The ruling class tries to ingratiate
itself with them. The universities have essentially declared war on society
at large. The great cry of the student radicals is freedom: freedom from
the established norms of society, freedom from manners, freedom from inequality,
freedom from the past.
<p>Russia&rsquo;s descent into vice and insanity is a powerful warning of what
happens when a nation declares war on the past in the hope of building
a terrestrial paradise. Dostoevsky did not live to see the abominations
he predicted but Solzhenitsyn experienced them first hand. <i>The Gulag
Archipelago</i> and <i>August 1914</i> can be seen as histories of ideas,
as attempts to account for the dreadful fate that befell Russia after 1917.

Solzhenitsyn identifies education and the way teachers saw their duty
as instilling hostility to all forms of traditional authority as the major
factors that explain why Russia&rsquo;s youth was seduced by revolutionary ideas.
In the West, during the 1960s and 1970s – which can collectively be called
&#8220;the 60s&#8221; – we hear a powerful echo of the collective mental capitulation
of Russia that took place in the 1870s and continued through the revolution.&nbsp;
<p>One of the echoes of Marxism that continues to reverberate today is
the idea that truth resides in class (or sex or race or erotic orientation).
Truth is not something to be established by rational inquiry, but depends
on the perspective of the speaker. In the multicultural universe, a person&rsquo;s
perspective is &#8220;valued&#8221; (a favorite word) according to class. Feminists,
blacks, environmentalists and homosexuals have a greater claim to truth
because they are &#8220;oppressed.&#8221; In the misery of &#8220;oppression&#8221; they see truth
more clearly than the white heterosexual men who &#8220;oppress&#8221; them. This is
a perfect mirror image of the Marxist proletariat&rsquo;s moral and intellectual
superiority over the bourgeoisie. Today, &#8220;oppression&#8221; confers a &#8220;privileged
perspective&#8221; that is essentially infallible. To borrow an expression from
Robert Bork&rsquo;s <i>Slouching Towards Gomorrah</i>, black and feminist activists
are &#8220;case-hardened against logical argument&#8221; – just as Communist true believers
were.
<p>Indeed, feminist and anti-racist activists openly reject objective truth.
Confident that they have intimidated their opposition, feminists are able
to make all kinds of demands on the assumption that men and women are equal
in every way. When outcomes do not match that belief, this is only more
evidence of white-male deviltry.&nbsp;
<p>One of the most depressing sights in the West today, particularly in
the universities and in the media, is the readiness to treat feminism as
a major contribution to knowledge and to submit to its absurdities. Remarkably,
this requires no physical violence. It is the desire to be accepted that
makes people truckle to these middle-class, would-be revolutionaries. Peter
Verkhovensky, who orchestrates murder and mayhem in <i>The Devils</i>,
expresses it with admirable contempt: &#8220;All I have to do is to raise my
voice and tell them that they are not sufficiently liberal.&#8221; The race hustlers,
of course, play the same game: Accuse a late-20th century liberal of &#8220;racism&#8221;
or &#8220;sexism&#8221; and watch him fall apart in an orgy of self-flagellation and
Maoist self-criticism. Even &#8220;conservatives&#8221; wilt at the sound of those
words.
<p>Ancient liberties and assumptions of innocence mean nothing when it
comes to &#8220;racism:&#8221; You are guilty until proven innocent, which is nearly
impossible, and even then you are forever suspect. An accusation of &#8220;racism&#8221;
has much the same effect as an accusation of witchcraft did in 17th century
Salem.
<p>It is the power of the charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; that stifles the derision
that would otherwise meet the idea that we should &#8220;value diversity.&#8221; If
&#8220;diversity&#8221; had real benefits whites would want more of it, and would ask
that yet more cities in the U.S. and Europe be handed over to immigrants.
Of course, they are not rushing to embrace diversity and multiculturalism;
they are in headlong flight in the opposite direction. Valuing diversity
is a hobby for people who do not have to endure its benefits.
<p>A multicultural society is one that is inherently prone to conflict,
not harmony. This is why we see a huge growth in government bureaucracies
dedicated to resolving disputes along racial and cultural lines. These
disputes can never be resolved permanently because the bureaucrats deny
one of the major causes: race. This is why there is so much talk of the
&#8220;multicultural&#8221; rather than the more precise &#8220;multiracial.&#8221; Ever more changes
and legislation are introduced to make the host society ever more congenial
to racial minorities. This only creates more demands, and encourages the
non-shooting war against whites, their civilization, and even the idea
of the West.
<p>How is such a radical program carried forward? The Soviet Union had
a massive system of censorship – the Communists even censored street maps
– and it is worth noting there were two kinds of censorship: the blatant
censorship of state agencies and the more subtle self-censorship that the
inhabitants of &#8220;peoples democracies&#8221; soon learned.
<p>The situation in the West is not so straightforward. There is nothing
remotely comparable to Soviet-style government censorship and yet we have
deliberate suppression of dissent. Arthur Jensen, Hans Eysenck, J. Philippe
Rushton, Chris Brand, Michael Levin, and Glayde Whitney have all been vilified
for their racial views. The case of Prof. Rushton is particularly troubling
because his academic work was investigated by the police. The attempt to
silence him was based on provisions of Canadian hate speech laws. This
is just the sort of intellectual terror one expected in the old Soviet
Union. To find it in a country that prides itself on being a pillar of
Western liberal democracy is one of the most disturbing consequences of
multiculturalism.
<p>A mode of opinion control softer than outright censorship is the current
obsession with fictional role models. Today, the feminist and anti-racist
theme is constantly worked into movies and television as examples of Bartold
Brecht&rsquo;s principle that the Marxist artist must show the world not as it
is but as it ought to be. This is why we have so many screen portrayals
of wise black judges; street-wise, straight-shooting lady policemen; minority
computer geniuses; and, of course, degenerate white men. This is almost
a direct borrowing from Soviet-style socialist realism, with its idealized
depictions of sturdy proletarians routing capitalist vermin.
<p>Multiculturalism has the same ambitions as Soviet Communism. It is absolutist
in the pursuit of its various agendas, yet it relativizes all other perspectives
in its attack on its enemies. Multiculturalism is an ideology to end all
other ideologies, and these totalitarian aspirations permit us to draw
two conclusions: First, multiculturalism must eliminate all opposition
<i>everywhere</i>. There can be no safe havens for counter-revolutionaries.
Second, once it is established the multicultural paradise must be defended
at all costs. Orthodoxy must be maintained with all the resources of the
state.
<p>Such a society would be well on its way to becoming totalitarian. It
might not have concentration camps, but it would have re-education centers
and sensitivity training for those sad creatures who still engaged in &#8220;white-male
hegemonic discourse.&#8221; Rather than the hard totalitarianism of the Soviet
state we would have a softer version in which our minds would be wards
of the state. We would be liberated from the burden of thought and therefore
unable to fall into the heresy of political incorrectness.
<p>If we think of multiculturalism as yet another manifestation of 20th
century totalitarianism, can we take solace in the fact that the Soviet
Union eventually collapsed? Is multiculturalism a phase, a periodic crisis
through which the West is passing, or does it represent something fundamental
and perhaps irreversible?

Despite the efforts of pro-Soviet elements, the West recognized the Soviet
empire as a threat. It does not recognize multiculturalism as a threat
in the same way. For this reason, many of its assumptions and objectives
remain unchallenged. Still, there are some grounds for optimism, for example,
the speed with which the term &#8220;political correctness&#8221; caught on. It took
the tenured radicals completely by surprise, but it is only a small gain.&nbsp;
<p>In the long term, the most important battleground in the war against
multiculturalism is the United States. The struggle is likely to be a
slow, frustrating war of attrition. If it fails, the insanity of multiculturalism
is something white Americans will have to live with. Of course, at some
point whites may demand an end to being punished because of black failure.
As Prof. Michael Hart argues in <i>The Real American Dilemma</i> (published
by New Century Foundation and available from AR for $11.95, postage paid),
there could be racial partition of the United States. We may find that
what happened in the Balkans is not peculiar to that part of the world.
Race war is not something the affluent radicals deliberately seek but their
policies are pushing us in that direction.
<p>I have argued so far that the immediate context for understanding political
correctness and multiculturalism is the Soviet Union and its catastrophic
utopian experiment. And yet the PC/multicultural mentality is much older.
In <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>, Edmund Burke offers
a portrait of the French radicals that is still relevant 200 years after
he wrote it:
<blockquote>
&#8220;They have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off
by a very full measure of confidence in their own. With them it is sufficient
motive to destroy an old scheme of things, because it is an old one. As
to the new, they are in no sort of fear with regard to the duration of
a building run up in haste; because duration is no object to those who
think little or nothing has been done before their time, and who place
all their hopes in discovery.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p><br>Of course, multiculturalism is far from being a solution to racial or
cultural conflict. Quite the contrary. Multiculturalism is the road to
a special kind of hell that we have already seen in this gruesome 20th
century, a hell that man, having abandoned reason and in revolt against
God&rsquo;s order, builds for himself and others.
