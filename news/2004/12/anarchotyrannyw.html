<h1>Anarcho-Tyranny&mdash;Where Multiculturalism Leads</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Francis, VDARE.com, Dec. 31</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Europe, if not in the United States, some people are beginning to grasp that just maybe they made a mistake when they decided to welcome millions of immigrants over the last several decades. </p>
<p>The most recent European to get it is former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who has been making noises about the damage he and his colleagues have inflicted on their own societies.</p>
<p>Interviewed in a Hamburg newspaper last month, Mr. Schmidt confessed, <b>&#147;The concept of multiculturalism is </b><b>difficult to make fit</b><b> with a democratic society&#148; </b>and that importing thousands of Turkish <b>&#147;<i>gastarbeiter</i>,<i>&#148;</b></i> or foreign guest workers, into Germany over the last several decades was a bit of a boo-boo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hardly the first to see this, although admittedly, at the age of 85, he&rsquo;s just a wee bit behind the curve. </p>
<p>As long ago as 1990, I wrote, in an article in <i>Chronicles</i> magazine, </p>
<b><p>&#147;The late Roman Empire, the </b><b>Byzantine </b><b>Empire, the </b><b>Ottoman</b><b> Empire, and the dominions of the </b><b>Habsburgs</b><b> and the Romanoffs, among others, all presided over a kind of rainbow coalition of nations and peoples, who for the most part managed to live happily because their secret compulsions to spill each other&rsquo;s blood was restrained by the overwhelming power of the despots and dynasties who ruled them. </p>
<p>&#147;Political freedom relies on a shared political culture as much as on the oppositions and balances that social differentiation creates, and when the common culture disintegrates under the impact of mass migrations, only institutionalized force can hold the regime together.&#148; </b>[<i>July, 1990, </i><a href="/pdf/all1990.pdf"><i>PDF</i></a>]</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful, but I gather it&rsquo;s what Mr. Schmidt was driving at. To have freedom on a stable political basis, you have to have a homogeneous culture and society, composed of people who share the same values and beliefs. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This month Great Britain simply arrested two of its leading opponents of immigration, Nick Griffin of the British National Party and the party&rsquo;s founder John Tyndall, on charges of <b>&#147;inciting racial hatred.&#148;</b> Each, it seems, had made (in private meetings secretly taped by undercover informants) derogatory (or perhaps merely critical) remarks about Islam. </p>
<p>The arrests are transparent efforts by the British overclass to muzzle rising political challengers, but they&rsquo;re also part of the drift toward authoritarianism that mass immigration provokes.</p>
