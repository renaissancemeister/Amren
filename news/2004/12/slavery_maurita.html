<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4091579.stm">Slavery: Mauritania&rsquo;s Best Kept Secret</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pascale Harter, BBC News, Dec. 13</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Skyra is a runaway Mauritanian slave. Her earliest childhood memories are of fetching water, tending animals and cooking and cleaning. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was tied up all night and all day. They only untied me so I could do my chores. In the end I could barely move my limbs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She never earnt a single penny. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All those years,&rdquo; she told me, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t even own a goat&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Mohamed could not tell me his surname or his age. </p>
<p>As a slave he didn&rsquo;t own the right to either. </p>
<p>But in a candlelit shack in the sandy outskirts of the capital, Nouakchott, he told me the story of his life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I became a slave,&rdquo; he told me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just born one. My family were slaves. We did all the hard work for our master and all we received in return was beatings.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Proof </p>
<p>After three attempts at making slavery illegal, the latest as recently as 1981, Mauritania has finally enacted a law which goes further than ever before, making slave ownership punishable with a fine or prison sentence. </p>
<p>But a year on, and no-one has yet been prosecuted under the new law. &ldquo;We enacted it just to meet international standards,&rdquo; says Bamariam Koita, director of the government&rsquo;s Human Rights Commission. </p>
<p>Mr Koita maintains that no-one has been prosecuted because slavery was abolished long ago in Mauritania. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen a slave? Have you seen a slave market? Of course you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he puffed, confidently answering his own question. </p>
<p>He has a point. Human beings in chains are not bought and sold in the full glare of Nouakchott&rsquo;s market. It&rsquo;s even worse than that, according to Boubakar Messaoud, founder of the local association SOS Slaves. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A captured slave knows freedom, so to keep him you have to chain him,&rdquo; says Mr Messaoud. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But a Mauritanian slave, whose parents and grandparents before him were slaves, doesn&rsquo;t need chains. He has been brought up as a domesticated animal.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Rape </p>
<p>Skyra was born to a slave mother so there was never any question she would be anything else. She remembers the years she spent treated like an animal. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They raped me often,&rdquo; she says shaking with anger. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At night, when everyone was asleep, they came for me and I couldn&rsquo;t stop them. If I had been free I would never have let this happen to me&rdquo;. </p>
<p>A living reminder of her slavery nestles in Skyra&rsquo;s lap, another sleeps at her feet, on the floor of her corrugated iron shack. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My master is the father of my first child, my master&rsquo;s son is the father of my second child and my baby girl&rsquo;s father was my master&rsquo;s nephew&rdquo;. </p>
<p>In this way says Boubakar Messaoud, &ldquo;We have achieved what the American plantation owners dreamed of &mdash; the breeding of perfectly submissive slaves&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Count the slaves </p>
<p>Skyra was not perfectly submissive. Her small insurrections earned her beatings until she found the strength &mdash; and the opportunity &mdash; to run away. She was determined that her children would not be born into slavery as she had been. </p>
<p>Mohamed escaped his master when soldiers passed by his isolated village in the desert. &ldquo;When my master demanded the soldiers hand me over, I told them I would rather they shot me dead and buried me right there than return with my master.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In answer to the Mauritanian government&rsquo;s assertion that slavery no longer exists in Mauritania, Mohamed recites the names of the family members he left behind in slavery. &ldquo;If I tell you their names, can you count them?&rdquo; he asked shyly. &ldquo;I was never taught&rdquo;. There are eight members of his immediate family still living as slaves, and Mohamed tells me there are many more in Mauritania. </p>
<p>It is difficult to know how many though. International human rights organisations such as Amnesty International are prevented from entering the country to conduct research. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only has the government denied the existence of slavery and failed to respond to cases brought to its attention,&rdquo; says Amnesty, &ldquo;it has hampered the activities of organisations which are working on the issue, including by refusing to grant such organisations official recognition.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Boubakar Messaoud and other members of SOS Slaves have been imprisoned and harassed by the authorities for their anti-slavery campaigning. </p>
<p>It seems the government has little interest in really wiping out slavery. Meanwhile slavery remains Mauritania&rsquo;s best kept open secret. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone knew we were slaves,&rdquo; said Mohamed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal thing, to have slaves in Mauritania.&rdquo;</p>
