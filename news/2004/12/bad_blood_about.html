			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sonja Carstens, News24.com, Dec. 2</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pretoria - If you are black or Coloured, the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) does not want your blood. </p>
<p>This came to light in a ruling by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in a case between the SANBS and the Health and Other Service Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa) over the unfair dismissal of a union member. </p>
<p>Poppie Bereng, a nurse, was dismissed because she opposed the SANBS&rsquo;s policy not to use the blood of black or Coloured donors, no matter how long they have been donating blood, because they are considered to be too much of a risk. Their blood is instead incinerated or destroyed in another manner. </p>
<p>The CCMA said Bereng, who is black, had conscientious objections to the policy as a Christian and she was upset because she had to lie to black donors who believed their blood was being used to save the lives of others. Bereng worked on a contract basis for the SANBS before she was given a permanent appointment on July 5. </p>
<p>On July 16, she attended an urgent staff meeting where the shortage of blood was discussed. </p>
<p>At the meeting, one of her colleagues asked whether high-risk donors in category 3 and 4 could be recruited. </p>
<p>It was explained to Bereng that category 3 and 4 donors were black and<br>
Coloured donors respectively whose blood was not used. </p>
<p>Bereng testified that she was &#8220;shocked&#8221; and wanted clarity on the policy before signing her service contract. She was not prepared to remain in the service of an employer who supported a &#8220;discriminatory policy&#8221;. </p>
<p>Services terminated </p>
<p>After another meeting, Bereng was given until August 2 to sign the contract. She received a letter the next day that her service had been terminated. Commissioner Thamsanga Garry Mvumbi found that Bereng&rsquo;s demands were not unreasonable under the Constitution. </p>
<p>&#8220;I find the allegations that the policy - to discriminate against blacks because of their skin colour - was approved by the World Health Organisation frightening and baseless. I cannot believe that the minister of health would allow such a policy to exist in a democratic country,&#8221; Mvumbi said. </p>
<p>He ordered the SANBS to re-employ Bereng and pay out R46 662 as six months of her salary. </p>
<p>Hospersa applied to the CCMA for an attachment order after the SANBS<br>
re-employed Bereng but did not pay out the money. This application has not been heard. The SANBS has taken the CCMA ruling under review. </p>
<p>On the SANBS&rsquo;s donor form, the donor has to indicate his or her ethnic group &#8220;for statistical purposes&#8221;. </p>
