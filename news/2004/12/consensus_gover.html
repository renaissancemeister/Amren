<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>At the end of his first year in Switzerland&rsquo;s consensus-driven cabinet, Justice Minister Christoph Blocher remains as divisive and controversial a figure as ever.</p>
<p>Opinions differ about his achievements in government, but allies and enemies alike agree that he has changed the complexion of government.</p>
<p>A former businessman, the billionaire and veteran parliamentarian was elected to the Swiss government in December 2003, after his rightwing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party triumphed in parliamentary elections two months earlier.</p>
<p>His election changed the traditional make-up of the cabinet, prompting hopes and fears about what it would mean for Switzerland&rsquo;s multi-party government.</p>
<p>Twelve months on Kurt Imhof, a sociologist at Zurich University, has no doubts about Blocher&rsquo;s impact. &ldquo;We are facing a divided cabinet,&rdquo; he told swissinfo.</p>
<p>Conflict</p>
<p>He said the unprecedented number of leaked stories about alleged conflict within the cabinet would erode confidence in the government with far-reaching consequences for society and the economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was naïve to think that Blocher could be tamed by integrating him into the seven-member cabinet,&rdquo; said Imhof.</p>
<p>Blocher has not shied away from controversial statements and actions, such as inviting another cabinet member to step down &mdash; not done in Switzerland &mdash; and trying to force through drastic spending cuts.</p>
<p>As a cabinet minister he is expected to support government policy and abide by the principle of collegiality. But he has flouted cabinet rules on a number of occasions, triggering heated debates and angry reactions.</p>
<p>Better than expected</p>
<p>Blocher has admitted that he was not sure what kind of a welcome he would receive in the cabinet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I thought they would not accept me, or any of my policies,&rdquo; he told swissinfo. &ldquo;But this is far from the truth. In general, the situation is better than expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also downplayed apparent conflicts in the cabinet and claimed to have encouraged more open discussion and to have broken a few taboos.</p>
<p>Blocher said he was committed to the system of consensus, but added that politicians would have to decide at the next election whether they wanted to hold on to a government made up of the four leading parties.</p>
<p>The former owner of the Ems chemical company has criticised a lack of cost awareness and managerial know-how in the federal administration.</p>
<p>Achievements</p>
<p>Blocher said he had succeeded in his attempt to rein in rampant bureaucracy by reducing spending and axing more than 100 jobs in his justice ministry.</p>
<p>He pledged to continue a tough line on asylum after the number of applications dropped by more than 30 per cent over the past 11 months.</p>
<p>Newspapers gave Blocher mixed reviews for his achievements as cabinet minister. The weekly &ldquo;Weltwoche&rdquo;, which is said to be close to Blocher&rsquo;s party, gave him credit for breaking certain taboos.</p>
<p>The Bern-based daily &ldquo;Der Bund&rdquo; said Blocher&rsquo;s power is limited by the constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the former opposition figurehead with a mission makes good use of his limited options. He might change the way the government thinks and tackles certain policy issues,&rdquo; the paper said.</p>
<p>The tabloid &ldquo;Blick&rdquo; was less generous in its assessment and bluntly gave him the mark &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Shift to the Right</p>
<p>Blocher was one of two conservative politicians &mdash; beside Hans-Rudolf Merz from the centre-right Radical Party &mdash; elected to the cabinet last year, prompting concerns about a shift to the Right.</p>
<p>The centre-left Social Democrats said the new government had achieved little in 2004.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The centre-right majority in the cabinet is a coalition of losers and was defeated in three crucial nationwide votes this year,&rdquo; said Hans-Jürg Fehr, president of the Social Democrats.</p>
<p>His counterpart from the centre-right Christian Democratic Party, Doris Leuthard, saw expectations, which were not fulfilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even experienced politicians with close links to the business community only cook with water,&rdquo; Leuthard told &ldquo;Der Bund&rdquo; newspaper.</p>
<p>However, political scientist Regula Stämpfli believes that Blocher&rsquo;s arrival in cabinet marks a sea change in Swiss politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabinet in its current form [with very different and strong personalities] will never be able to work together properly,&rdquo; Stämpfli told the ATS news agency.</p>
