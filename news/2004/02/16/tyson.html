			<h1>
				How Tyson Spent Cool $470M on his Way to Fiscal Ruin 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Paul Scott, New York Post, Feb. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WHEN it comes to money, boxer Mike Tyson has a famously short memory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This week, the one-time world heavyweight champion has been wracking what is left of his punch-drunk brain to remember what happened to the fortune-estimated at $470 million-he has frittered away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now down to his last $5,000 and a self-declared bankrupt, he has been trying, at the behest of his lawyers, to work out where it all went. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to court papers filed in New York last week, the fallen fighter simply gave away vast chunks of his wealth to an assorted band of hangers-on and sycophants who attached themselves to him when the going was good. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that the money has gone, so too have the parasites, along with the lavish gifts he bestowed on them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tyson claims he &ldquo;does not recall the identities&rdquo; of the cronies who were presented with, among many other extravagant gifts, men&rsquo;s mink and chinchilla coats, and a woman&rsquo;s mink jacket valued at more than $75,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The whereabouts of another $1.1 million worth of gifts are unknown, say the court documents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing&rsquo;s for sure, however: The coterie of girls, minders and henchmen who lived the high life at his expense won&rsquo;t be lining up to return the diamonds, Cartier watches and cars he gave away in the orgy of excess lasting almost 20 years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The good times are over forever. The gravy train that funded his ultra-decadent lifestyle has been spectacularly derailed. Tyson really is broke. 
			</p>
			<p>
				THE details of his demise, chronicled in the court pa pers, make fascinating reading. In one month, last November, he earned just $5. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His expenditures over Christmas, in particular, are a pitiful reminder of how far from grace Iron Mike has fallen-he spent just $85. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Tyson&rsquo;s newfound frugality is born out of necessity. He owes more than $26 million to a host of creditors, including more than $3.7 million to the British taxman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now he&rsquo;s relying on a frustratingly protracted and expensive legal battle with his former manager, the flamboyant promoter Don King, to win back the $124 million he says he is owed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But even those who support the ex-champ fear that, not for the first time, he is punching above his weight. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 37-year-old Tyson is a shadow of the fearsome and majestic fighter who first became the champion of the world at the age of 20. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His prodigious talent has been dulled by age, debauchery and an increasing reliance on antidepressant pills. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now he is reduced to negotiating a deal for himself to fight a wrestling match in Japan with a former funeral-home worker and failed football player called The Beast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even Tyson&rsquo;s own psychiatrist, to whom he turned in 2000 to help him deal with his violence and addiction to vast spending, is suing his client for $9,000-a-month treatment fees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tyson&rsquo;s descent from fighting machine to snarling pantomime baddie is the result of a profligate lifestyle never before seen in a business well used to extravagant displays of wealth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He once owned five houses, one of which boasted 38 bathrooms. Each came complete with a garage full of Bentleys, Mercedes and BMWs-110 cars in total, according to one estimate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His legal bills have been estimated at almost $5.6 million a year, and then there is the $110,000 a year he spends on cell phones. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, his divorce from his second wife, pediatrician Monica Turner, cost him $13 million and his mansion in Farmington, Conn. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He bought the 17-acre estate with 18 bedrooms, seven kitchens and its own nightclub in 1996, but stayed there only one night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the height of his spending spree, Tyson would regularly make the Versace store at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace in Las Vegas close its doors so he could go on $470,000 shopping splurges with the team of hangers-on. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He would spend up to $1.8 million a visit at his favorite jewelry shop. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a two-year period, his gardening bill at just one of his homes was a massive $375,000, while on a trip to London he tried to buy a $1.1 million Formula 1 racing car. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The deal fell through only when he discovered he could not drive it on the road. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In one bizarre act of indulgence, he spent $188,000 on two white Bengal tigers he delighted in taking on in noisy wrestling bouts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				THE loss of his millions has hit Brooklyn-born Tyson hard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Friends say he rarely visits any of the homes he still nominally owns in Ohio, Las Vegas and New York before they are sold off to meet his mammoth debts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead, he leads a nomadic existence, running up huge limousine bills going from party to party at the Las Vegas hotels and casinos where his once-legendary boxing talent still guarantees him a welcome of sorts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His bills are being picked up by the dwindling number of promoters and TV channels who believe that getting Tyson back into the ring will pull in the bettors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Accompanying Tyson on these trips is an ever-diminishing band of aggressive and intimidating gang members, some of whom are tattooed with the name of their master. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past, they have worked as &ldquo;gofers&rdquo; for him, procuring the never-ending stream of young women who still wanted to share Tyson&rsquo;s bed, despite his 1992 conviction for the rape of Miss Black America contestant and Sunday school teacher Desiree Washington in an Indianapolis hotel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the trial, Tyson, who had been on a 72-hour booze and drug binge, had attempted to prove that the 18-year-old virgin had been a willing participant. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was ultimately found guilty of raping her and sentenced to six years in prison. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After the conviction, Tyson took to videotaping his sex sessions with a procession of prostitutes and strippers to protect himself from further rape claims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tyson now claims to have found love again with model and actress Luz Whitney, but his reputation and history do not inspire confidence he will at last settle down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And to add to his woes, he is facing trial for assaulting two men outside a Brooklyn hotel last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of his victims says he was left with short-term memory loss and plans to sue the boxer for the beating Tyson allegedly dished out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ironically, given Tyson&rsquo;s precarious state of mind, there are those close to him who are predicting a comeback in the ring for the ex-champion now that British world title holder Lennox Lewis has quit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tyson&rsquo;s friend and biographer Montieth Illingworth says: &ldquo;Given everything that has happened to Mike during the past year, it might sound odd but I honestly believe that if he can get himself together he could regain his world title.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sadly, few in the boxing world would bet on it.
