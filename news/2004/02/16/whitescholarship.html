				New Scholarship Created for Whites Only
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>CNN.com, Feb. 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				BRISTOL, Rhode Island (AP) &mdash; A student group at Roger Williams University is offering a new scholarship for which only white students are eligible, a move they say is designed to protest affirmative action. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The application for the $250 award requires an essay on &ldquo;why you are proud of your white heritage&rdquo; and a recent picture to &ldquo;confirm whiteness.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Evidence of bleaching will disqualify applicants,&rdquo; says the application, issued by the university&rsquo;s College Republicans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jason Mattera, 20, who is president of the College Republicans, said the group is parodying minority scholarships. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We think that if you want to treat someone according to character and how well they achieve academically, then skin color shouldn&rsquo;t really be an option,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Many people think that coming from a white background you&rsquo;re automatically privileged, you&rsquo;re automatically rich and your parents pay full tuition. That&rsquo;s just not the case.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The stunt has angered some at the university, but the administration is staying out of the fray. The school&rsquo;s provost said it is a student group&rsquo;s initiative and is not endorsed by Roger Williams. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mattera, who is of Puerto Rican descent, is himself a recipient of a $5,000 scholarship open only to a minority group. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;No matter what my ethnicity is, I&rsquo;m making a statement that scholarships should be given out based on merit and need,&rdquo; Mattera told the Providence Journal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His group took out a full-page ad in last week&rsquo;s issue of the university&rsquo;s student newspaper to tout the scholarship, which was for $50 until two donors came forward to add $100 each during the weekend, Mattera said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s not the first brush with controversy for the group. The school temporarily froze the Republicans&rsquo; money in the fall during a fight over a series of articles published in its monthly newsletter. One article alleged that a gay-rights group indoctrinates students into homosexual sex.
