			<p>
				<b> Racial violence surges in Zimbabwe</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>&copy; 2004 WorldNetDaily.com, Feb. 9 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				There&rsquo;s good reason for the white minority in southern Africa to be concerned about rampant threats of genocide by the black majority. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There&rsquo;s a precedent for it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, a surge of that kind of violence is terrorizing Zimbabwe&rsquo;s dwindling white population, particularly in the mountainous eastern Manicaland province, once a major tourist destination. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gisela Honeywill tells her horrifying story of being awakened at 3:15 a.m. three weeks ago. She and her husband found men on either side of their bed in the town of Rusape. They were tied up, beaten and robbed in a two-hour ordeal. When the gang found the couple had little money, they accused the family of hiding it. Mrs. Honeyill was threatened with rape. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My daughter was away on holiday, thank God,&rdquo; Mrs. Honeywill told the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/">London Telegraph.</a>&ldquo;They dragged me to her bedroom and stripped me. I thought they were just trying to scare me. I didn&rsquo;t believe I was going to be raped. A friend of mine, Francie, was stripped just a short time ago, but they didn&rsquo;t rape her. Then the small fat man hit me, forced my legs open. I didn&rsquo;t bite or scratch, my hands were tied behind my back. Then &hellip; I can&rsquo;t remember anything except some time went by, and he said, &lsquo;I have finished now.&rsquo;&ldquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Conrad Honeywill was on his knees crying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it to her, don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; the paper reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The three attackers wore Zimbabwe Republic police flak jackets, Honeywill said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Because up to a third of sexually active Zimbabweans are infected with the AIDS virus, Mrs. Honeywill was concerned the rape could also be a death sentence for her. Police, according to the report, were unable to arrange an urgent medical examination. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Non-Governmental Organization Forum, there were more than 1,000 cases of politically motivated violence, murder, rape, kidnapping and torture in the country in the last 12 months. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another 782 citizens were denied their constitutional right to freedom of expression, while 77 people received death threats, 496 were tortured and four may be presumed dead after they disappeared last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the rape campaign, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s white farmers have been systematically murdered by radical blacks associated with the Azania People&rsquo;s Organization, or AZAPO, since 1994. The government of Robert Mugabe has winked at the farm seizures - and sometimes encouraged them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There were about 40,000 white farmers in South Africa until two years ago. More than 1,200 were murdered between 1994 and 2002. Mugabe&rsquo;s African National Congress, backed by the United Nations, European Union, Russia, China and the U.S. State Department, took power in 1994. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, there were some 6,000 attacks by rogue gangs on white Boer Afrikaner farmers during the same period. The government refuses to keep statistics on the attacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the farm killings appear to be drug-related. South African police say that Pakistanis have bought up several farms after the white owners were killed and began planting poppies of Central Asian origin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;South Africa&rsquo;s dirty little secret - well, there are many dirty secrets here - is that we are the transit point for 25 percent of the world&rsquo;s drugs,&rdquo; South African policewoman Debbie Botha told WorldNetDaily in 2002.
