				U.S. Vows to Get Tough on Illegal Immigrants
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Lornet Turnbull, Seattle Times, Jan. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. government would intensify efforts to track down and deport illegal immigrants who choose not to participate in the kind of temporary-worker program outlined this month by President Bush, the nation&rsquo;s top immigration official said yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Seattle, Eduardo Aguirre Jr., director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the president&rsquo;s proposal is a chance for an estimated 8 million illegal immigrants to come clean. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But if they don&rsquo;t, &ldquo;we will find those who are not taking advantage of the law,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their numbers will be smaller. There will be a greater probability of deportation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They are better served by registering with the program than running the risk of being caught.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Confirmed last summer by the U.S. Senate to this key Department of Homeland Security position, Aguirre is visiting division employees while talking up the president&rsquo;s immigration plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Himself an immigrant, Aguirre came from Cuba in the early 1960s as part of Operation Pedro Pan &mdash; a secret U.S. Government-backed mission to remove middle-class Cuban children from the Communist regime. Organized by Catholic Charities, it remains one of the largest exoduses of unaccompanied minors in history &mdash; and one of the least known. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Aguirre&rsquo;s Seattle stop comes in the same week House Democrats outlined a measure that would exceed Bush&rsquo;s plan by establishing a pathway to permanent residency and eventual citizenship for certain illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigrant advocates, as well as those who favor stricter immigration controls, have denounced the Bush plan as inadequate in repairing the nation&rsquo;s beleaguered immigration system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush&rsquo;s proposal would match employers with foreign workers when U.S. citizens couldn&rsquo;t be found to fill the jobs. It would allow illegal immigrants now employed to temporarily become legal, able to travel home to visit family without fear of being denied re-entry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A national survey of Latinos released yesterday shows that while a majority support the president&rsquo;s proposal, that support dropped once they learned that immigrant workers would have to go back home once their legal status expired. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The plan is not intended to reward illegal behavior,&rdquo; Aguirre said yesterday. &ldquo;It gives people who have broken the law an opportunity to work legally and not be concerned about being picked up tomorrow and sent home.&rdquo;
