			<h1>
				Crowd Chants &lsquo;Usama!&rsquo; at U.S. Soccer Team
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>FoxNews.com, Feb. 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				GUADALAJARA, Mexico &mdash; The boos nearly drowned out &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; and a few dozen fans chanted &ldquo;Usama! Usama!&rdquo; as the United States was eliminated by Mexico in Olympic men&rsquo;s soccer qualifying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A loud anti-American crowd yelled the first name of Usama bin Laden, the leader of the Al Qaeda terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, as Mexico beat the United States 4-0 Tuesday night in the under-23 tournament, claiming a berth in the Athens Olympics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As U.S. players left the stadium for their bus, several fans &mdash; some clutching beers &mdash; chanted &ldquo;Usama! Usama!&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police in riot gear held back the crowd and urged people to calm down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think the fans here in Mexico are terrific; I think their patriotism and support of their team is terrific,&rdquo; U.S. coach Glenn Myernick said. &ldquo;But unless I missed something, not one of them came down on the field and kicked the ball. We were beaten by a better football team tonight, not by the fans.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				For Mexico, the game partly avenged a 2-0 loss to the United States in the second round of the 2002 World Cup, a far more important tournament involving national teams. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. men will miss the Olympics for the first time since 1980--when the entire American delegation boycotted the Moscow Games. Mexico also ended the United States&rsquo; 19-tournament streak of qualifying for every FIFA men&rsquo;s outdoor event, including the World Cup, the Olympics, the World Youth Championship for players under 20 and the Under-17 World Championship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While both Mexican national television networks broadcast Tuesday&rsquo;s game live in Mexico, there was no television in the United States, where the game was broadcast on closed circuit to about 190 restaurants.
