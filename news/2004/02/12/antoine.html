				LOS ANGELES (AP) &mdash; Antoine Miller, one of four men prosecuted in the beating of truck driver Reginald Denny during the 1992 riots, was killed in a nightclub shooting, police said Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Miller died Sunday after being shot Feb. 1 in Hollywood, said Los Angeles police Officer Lucy Diaz. He was 31. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One other man was injured. The shooting remained under investigation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Miller was prosecuted for the beating of Denny on April 29, 1992. The truck driver was pulled from his truck at the start of the riots sparked when white police officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite being beaten nearly to death, Denny showed little anger toward the men prosecuted in his attack, even as they were acquitted of the most serious charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Miller, Henry Keith Watson and Lance Jerome Parker received probation. Damian &ldquo;Football&rdquo; Williams was sentenced for mayhem and misdemeanor assault.
