			<h1>
				Ridge Will Probe Immigration Sweep
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Joshua L. Weinstein, Press Herald Online (Portland, Maine), Feb. 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said Monday he will investigate a January immigration sweep in Portland that sparked significant local criticism because armed agents targeted the Preble Street Resource Center homeless shelter and minority-owned businesses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He made the commitment under questioning from U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who represents Maine and who chairs the Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees Ridge&rsquo;s department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During a Senate hearing on the department&rsquo;s budget Monday morning, Collins said &ldquo;we want the department to vigorously enforce our immigration laws,&rdquo; but told Ridge, &ldquo;we had many, many serious complaints from community leaders that the way in which this sweep was conducted created a great deal of fear among immigrants who are here legally. And the agents went to a homeless shelter. They targeted Latino, Asian and African restaurants which then experienced a dramatic drop in business throughout this period. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;And there just seems to me that there has to be a better way for the department to pursue its very important responsibilities and . . . to make sure that these sweeps are conducted in a way that is respectful of people and that do not target small business in a way that ends up hurting their business.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Maine&rsquo;s senior senator, Olympia Snowe, also a Republican, wrote to Ridge about the same matter on Feb. 6. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, Ridge was not familiar with the details of the Jan. 24 immigration sweep. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He told Collins, however, &ldquo;I would say hopefully if men and women and children are here legally, that they have nothing to fear and shouldn&rsquo;t fear . . . We don&rsquo;t want to discourage the border patrol from doing their job. We also want to encourage them to do it in a way that is consistent with the standards of service of the border control, and that&rsquo;s respecting the rights of individuals, be they legal or illegal, and the rights of the community.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The sweep resulted in 10 arrests, but provoked outrage in Portland, where some elected officials and community leaders questioned the tactics of some agents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mark Swann, the executive director of Preble Street Resource Center, said agents walked into the shelter and targeted four Latino men out of a room of 100. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The men all were in the nation legally-one was born here-but, Swann said, they were &ldquo;pulled out of the shelter, questioned vigorously and intimidated tremendously.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said &ldquo;it is great that our senators from Maine have taken note of this and are trying to be heard in Washington about what&rsquo;s going on in this community.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Juan Gonzalez, who owns La Bodega Latina in Portland, said he never questioned the border patrol&rsquo;s job-just the way the sweep was performed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They were profiling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By the senator taking this to the top, discussing this with Ridge, definitely gives us more confidence now saying, &lsquo;Yes, indeed, Maine is a state where immigrants are welcome.&rsquo;&rdquo;
