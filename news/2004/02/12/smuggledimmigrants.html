				<i>Associated Press, Feb. 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				MESA, Ariz. &mdash; Authorities have uncovered more than 160 illegal immigrants packed into an upscale home and arrested several men believed to be human smugglers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The immigrants were found Wednesday at a house along a golf course near the Phoenix-Scottsdale border, said Russell L. Ahr, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some were locked in bedrooms and others said they hadn&rsquo;t eaten in three days. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They were sitting shoulder to shoulder, back to back. You could not see the carpet,&rdquo; Ahr said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities said none of the three bathrooms in the 2,400-square-foot home was working and there was no furniture and no food other than canned goods brought by immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 60 of the men, women and juveniles were found locked in bedrooms with deadbolts, leading investigators to think they might have been hostages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahr said the immigrants came from Mexico and Central America, with those from Mexico paying their transporters between $1,200 and $1,500 and others paying as much as $6,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two weapons recovered inside the home, an AK-47 assault rifle and a 9mm handgun, were probably used by the smugglers to intimidate the immigrants and keep them from fleeing, authorities said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				U.S. immigration officials, FBI agents and Phoenix detectives participated in the roundup that required more than two buses and three vans to transport the immigrants downtown. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They were fed, fingerprinted, photographed and then checked against federal databases for criminal and immigration histories. Ahr said those without prior infractions would be transported to the border and released.
