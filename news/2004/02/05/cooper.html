				Supporters Call For Mercy For Kevin Cooper

				Hollywood Actors, Others Fighting To Stop Execution 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>TheKCRAChannel.com, Jan. 29 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SACRAMENTO, Calif. &mdash; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is facing a growing controversy over the first inmate scheduled to be executed under his leadership &mdash; and some of those fighting to stop the execution are, like Schwarzenegger, movie stars. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The fight to save the life of death row inmate Kevin Cooper had drawn the support of Hollywood heavyweights like Sean Penn, Denzel Washington and Richard Dreyfuss. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Former boxer Ruben &ldquo;Hurricane&rdquo; Carter and others held a news conference in Sacramento Thursday to urge the governor to delay the execution. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;All we are asking for is time. Human lives are critically affected by law &hellip; human lives are literally at stake,&rdquo; Carter said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An aggressive grass roots campaign is also under way to stop the execution, which is scheduled to take place in less than two weeks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cooper&rsquo;s supporters claim evidence that has already been examined could exonerate him. A <a href="https://www.savekevincooper.org/">Web site</a> has been created that solicits money to pay for publicity to get their message out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bill and Mary Ann Hughes&rsquo; son was one of four victims Cooper was convicted of killing in 1983 with a hatchet, knife and ice pick as they slept. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If anybody deserves the death penalty &hellip; it&rsquo;s Kevin Cooper,&rdquo; Mary Ann Hughes said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But since his conviction in 1985, the 46-year-old Cooper has gained support through his writings and publicity as an African American man who claims he was wrongly convicted by a prosecution full of holes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Schwarzenegger is a Republican who has gone on record supporting the death penalty. He could have to decide whether Cooper&rsquo;s case should be reviewed or to let the execution proceed.
