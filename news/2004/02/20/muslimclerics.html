				<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,1151110,00.html">Denmark Shuts out Muslim Clerics</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Ian Black, The Guardian, Feb. 19</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Denmark is tightening its immigration rules to make it harder for fundamentalist Muslim clerics to settle in the country and establish radical communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The move is designed to encourage Muslims to integrate into wider Danish society but is bound to attract criticism that it is discriminatory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the prime minister, said the measure would affect all religious groups, but a rightwing political party admitted it was principally intended to tackle Islamic extremism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Denmark&rsquo;s 170,000 Muslims account for 3% of the population and are the second largest religious community after the Lutheran church, followed by four-fifths of the country&rsquo;s 5.3 million strong population. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Access to obtaining a Danish residence permit for foreign missionaries has been too easy up until now,&rdquo; Mr Rasmussen said. &ldquo;That is why we are putting forward new requirements for residing in the country.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics complained that the influence of radical imams had been exaggerated, while the government said it merely wanted to encourage integration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is to make sure that they are worthy of the trust society shows by letting them in,&rdquo; a spokesman said yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Supporters of the measure accuse foreign clerics of urging Muslim immigrants to stick to customs such as wearing the veil, female circumcision and stopping women from working and learning Danish. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Rasmussen&rsquo;s minority centre-right government relies on the anti-immigrant Danish People&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s to pass legislation. The proposed changes are part of a deal reached last year with the People&rsquo;s party and the opposition Social Democrats. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The new rules will require any person coming to Denmark on a religious visa to show that they are a &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; candidate, are educated, financially self-supporting and connected with one of 200 recognised religious communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The DPP, which proposed the changes, confirmed they were aimed to curb the activities of Muslim clerics, or imams. &ldquo;In theory, these rules concern all clerics from all religions,&rdquo; said Peter Skaarup, a party spokesman. &ldquo;But in practice, they target the imams.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Like France, the Netherlands and other western European countries, Denmark has been struggling with Muslim issues since before, but especially after, the September 11 attacks on the US. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Danish media have reported the case of an imam who praised Osama bin Laden in his Friday sermons.
