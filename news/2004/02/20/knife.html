			<h1>
				Not Too Sharp
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>David Seifman and Carl Campanile, New York Post, Feb. 19 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A group of activists and students turned up at City Hall yesterday to demand that Mayor Bloomberg remove cops from 12 tough high schools-and one of them was nabbed with a knife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the press conference began, police at a metal-detector checkpoint seized a pocket knife from one of the event&rsquo;s organizers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was returned outside the gates of City Hall once cops determined that the 4-inch blade could be carried on the streets because it met legal standards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, mayoral aides questioned the kind of example that the activist set. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ironic to say the least,&rdquo; said mayoral spokesman Robert Lawson, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re glad he wasn&rsquo;t a student.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The person who had the knife refused to give his name to reporters or say why he was carrying it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				City Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn), one of the event&rsquo;s sponsors, called the comment about the knife from the mayor&rsquo;s spokesman a distraction from the real issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning the mayor now,&rdquo; declared Barron. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a disaster waiting to happen-when a gun gets discharged in our schools and a young person is killed.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kate Rhee, director of the Prison Moratorium Project, charged that the addition of 150 cops to the high schools was &ldquo;creating a school-to-prison pipeline.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And Sherise Townsend, 14, a ninth-grader at Sheepshead Bay HS in Brooklyn, said the bolstered security isn&rsquo;t making her feel any safer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re angry, are you supposed to just sit there?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If I want to express myself, I might yell, scream, whatever. I won&rsquo;t hit somebody. But they&rsquo;re going to think I am. Once you start yelling, they&rsquo;re going to pick you up, put you in handcuffs. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessary. Maybe you can go to your guidance counselor and work out your problem.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lester Young, the school system&rsquo;s executive in charge of youth development and community services, responded that cops are only one part of the effort to enhance security. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said officials are also &ldquo;analyzing all of these schools, providing supports for our students, such as counseling and mediation and transforming the overall culture of our schools.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bloomberg is also facing fire on the issue from his Independence Party ally, Lenora Fulani. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They should do in our schools what they do in schools with white kids,&rdquo; said Fulani, following a discussion she moderated with more than 100 students at the All Stars Project on West 42d Street. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They bring in counselors, psychologists and after-school programs.&rdquo;
