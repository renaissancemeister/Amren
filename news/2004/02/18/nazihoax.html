				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3472087.stm">Welshpool &lsquo;Nazi Pub&rsquo; Story Untrue</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Feb. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A journalist for the New Statesman magazine who caused a row by claiming to have witnessed a gathering of neo-Nazis in a mid Wales bar has admitted the pub does not exist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Freelance journalist Jack Jameson, who wrote the article headlined Weimar in Wales, told BBC Wales it was a composite of many pubs and that it was not meant to be taken as a news story but rather as &ldquo;an allegory.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Peter Wilby, the magazine&rsquo;s editor who had initially stood by the story, said on Friday: &ldquo;I have to say I&rsquo;m very sorry. Clearly, I&rsquo;m not very happy about it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The admission came after police were called in to investigate the magazine&rsquo;s claim that an unnamed mid Wales pub-about 15 miles from the home of British National Party leader Nick Griffin-was a favourite with supporters of the far-right group. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The freelance writer described how his car broke down in Welshpool and he wandered into a pub where German marching songs were being played and BNP supporters gave Nazi salutes to the strains of Deutschland &Uuml;ber Alles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dyfed-Powys Police wrote to its editor, Peter Wilby, asking him to provide information about the article after a complaint by a local Conservative politician and a threat of legal action by the town publicans&rsquo; association. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tory AM for Mid and West Wales Glyn Davies told BBC Wales&rsquo; Dragon&rsquo;s Eye programme that he was glad the magazine had been forced to come clean, but said the story should never have been written. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased, in a sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased the magazine has decided to apologise to the people of Welshpool. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;To me, the issue wasn&rsquo;t about racism, it was about journalistic standards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The issue was whether it was right for a national magazine to completely fabricate such a story.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was only by bringing in the police and the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) that the magazine has been forced to back down,&rdquo; he added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This has made the New Statesman look very, very silly. It is a fulsome, total apology, and something which must be very embarrassing for the editor of the magazine.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The first admission that the story was untrue came on BBC Wales&rsquo; current affairs programme, Dragon&rsquo;s Eye, broadcast on Thursday night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Jameson told presenter David Williams, &ldquo;It is, in fact, not a news story-it is an allegorical story. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is trying, by use of allegory and symbolism, to draw a comparison between certain happenings in mid Wales and what happened in Weimar, Germany, in 1933.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asked if the pub actually existed, he replied : &ldquo;If the pub does exist, it is, indeed, no more than a composite-something which is put together from a number of different instances. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If anybody has taken it seriously, of course I apologise. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a great fondness for Welshpool and the surrounding countryside.&rdquo;
