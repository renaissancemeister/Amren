				<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3476083.stm">Girl Killed by Russia &lsquo;Racists&rsquo;</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				A nine-year old Tajik girl has been stabbed to death in the Russian city of St Petersburg by suspected skinheads. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Feb. 10</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police said a group of youths armed with knives and bats attacked the girl on Monday night, stabbing her 11 times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her father and an 11-year old boy were also hospitalized with head wounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The attack was being widely seen in Russia as racist in origin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				St Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko, who described the attack as &ldquo;bestial&rdquo;, said they must combat any manifestations of nationalism in the city. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This crime is comparable to the terrorist act in the Moscow underground railway,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is different in scale but these events are of the same order.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				At least 39 people died last week in Moscow when a suspected suicide bomber detonated a bomb on an underground train. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Skinhead gangs&rsquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				St Petersburg police named the man injured in Monday&rsquo;s attack as Yusuf Sultanov, 34, from Tajikistan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was with his daughter, Hurshida, and an 11-year old boy, Alabir, when they were attacked in a courtyard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A report by Russia TV said investigators were confident that St Petersburg-based skinheads were behind the incident. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There were several small but well-organised neo-Nazi groups in the city, the report said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There have been several racist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities in the past, targeting foreign students, diplomats or immigrants from former Soviet Republics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An estimated 300 skinheads attacked market places in Moscow two years ago, killing three people. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chanting racist slogans, they smashed up market stalls and attacked anyone who appeared to be from the Caucasus region.
