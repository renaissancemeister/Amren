				Blood, Guts and Aids in SA&rsquo;s Army

			<p>
				<i>Pretoria News, Jan. 21</i> 
			</p>

				<i>(Found at southafricathetruth.com, a very interesting site. IJ)</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The launch of Project Phidisa is set to halt the decimation of South Africa&rsquo;s Defence Force as the HIV and Aids pandemic rages out of control among the country&rsquo;s armed forces. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At least one in five of the 70 000 SANDF members are currently infected with the incurable disease, with medical experts predicting the infection rate in the defence force will sky-rocket over the next few years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The department of defence, together with the United States National Institute of Health, on Tuesday launched Project Phidisa, a national campaign aimed at reducing the HIV and Aids infection rate among SANDF members. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The five-year project, in which clinical research will be conducted at six centres around South Africa, is aimed at developing the most appropriate plan of action on how anti-retrovirals and non anti-retroviral drugs can be administered to SANDF members and their families who volunteer for the project. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking at the launch of Phidisa, Deputy Defence Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge said South Africa needed to have a fighting-fit defence force. &ldquo;It is therefore imperative that we do everything in our power to ensure that our soldiers are healthy and that we show them that we have not given up on them,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Major-General Mokhethi Radebe, military health force preparation chief director, confirmed that 23 percent of the SANDF was suspected of being HIV-positive. He could not give the exact infection rate figure as HIV and Aids testing was done on a purely voluntary basis.
