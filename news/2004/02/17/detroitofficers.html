				<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4285131/">Two Detroit Police Officers Shot to Death</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Pair gunned down during traffic stop; suspect in custody 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>MSNBC, AP, Feb. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				DETROIT-A motorist pulled over in the middle of the night for a seemingly routine traffic stop got out of his truck and pumped several bullets into the two police officers who stopped him, killing them both, police said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Officers Jennifer Fettig, 26, and Matthew Bowens, 21, were shot about 2 a.m. Monday, becoming the 18th and 19th Detroit officers killed in the line of duty since 1990. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police used the suspect&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license, found in the police cruiser, to arrest Eric L. Marshall, 23, later Monday at his home. The unemployed Detroit man was likely to be arraigned Tuesday, Chief Ella Bully-Cummings said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The traffic stop had not been called in to police dispatchers. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what they stopped him for. It&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; said Cmdr. Craig Schwartz of the Major Crimes Division. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After making the stop, Bowens and Fettig returned to their cruiser with Marshall&rsquo;s license. The suspect got out of the pickup truck, approached the officers&rsquo; car and shot Fettig twice, at least once in the head, Schwartz said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The suspect ran away while Bowens got out of the cruiser and radioed for backup. The suspect returned and shot Bowens nine times before taking the officer&rsquo;s weapon and driving away, Schwartz said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At least 22 empty shell casings were found at the scene. Neither officer was able to return fire, Schwartz said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick said Bowens&rsquo; family noted he wanted to an officer for as long as they could remember. Bowens, who was married, joined the department in December 2000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is the only thing he wanted to do with his life,&rdquo; Kilpatrick said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fettig joined in October 2001 and was engaged to another Detroit officer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police Cmdr. Charles Barbieri said he knew Bowens and Fettig when they were rookies. &ldquo;This is very personal,&rdquo; Barbieri said. &ldquo;Two officers getting shot in the street in the middle of the night. And for what?&rdquo;
