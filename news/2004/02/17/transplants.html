			</h1>

				The United Network for Organ Sharing <a href="https://www.unos.org/data/ar2002/ar02_appendix_b_glossary.htm">says</a> that &ldquo;justice refers to allocation of organs to those patients in the most immediate need.&rdquo; As such, skin color should be irrelevant in deciding who gets a transplant. But although proponents are loath to make race an explicit factor in transplant policy they are surreptitiously redesigning the organ allocation system in order to increase the number of blacks who receive transplants. The system is being redesigned to meet the ideals of the social planners despite the fact that such &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; will result in more deaths overall. As a proponent of <a href="https://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/10/dollars_for_don.html">financial incentives for organ donors</a> I have often been accused of being immoral. But my conscience is clear &mdash; I have never advocated killing people to serve my idea of social justice.

			<p>
				From the Wall Street Journal (Friday, Feb. 6). 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				New rules for allocating scarce kidneys will result in 6.4% more blacks getting transplants, while slightly increasing the number of unsuccessful transplants, a study finds. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Blacks and other minorities have long been disadvantaged on transplant waiting lists &mdash; in part because the scoring system gave strong priority to compatibility between a recipient and the donated organ. Although blacks donate organs as often as whites, they have an extremely wide variety of protein markers on the outside of their cells &mdash; making an exact match much harder to find than for whites. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Making matters more acute, kidney disease in blacks is very common, owing to their higher rates of high blood pressure, which takes a toll on the urine-filtering organs. Blacks make up 12% of the U.S. population, but account for 36% of the 56,544 people in the U.S. waiting for a kidney. Prior to the scoring system overhaul, they were 33% less likely to get a kidney than whites. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				The new rules, implemented in May by the United Network for Organ Sharing, stop giving priority for a certain type of immunological match known as HLA-B. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				The report on the new system, in Thursday&rsquo;s New England Journal of Medicine, used a statistical method to predict what will happen under the new rules. It finds that, had the new rule been in effect in the year 2000, 2,292 blacks would have gotten kidneys, up 6.4% from the actual number of 2,154 blacks. Meanwhile, 3,954 whites would have gotten the organs, a decrease of 4%. Hispanics would have seen a 4.2% increase. Asians would have seen a 5.9% increase. 
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Critics feared the new rule could reduce the success rate of transplants, effectively wasting precious organs on people whose bodies were likely to reject them. About 2% more organs will be rejected in people of all races, resulting in the need for another transplant, the study predicts.
