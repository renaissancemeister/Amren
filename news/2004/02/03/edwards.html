			<h1>
				Edwards to Southern Whites: &ldquo;Get Lost&rdquo;
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Council of Conservative Citizens Online </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				On his campaign dash across South Carolina, John Edwards has kissed, hugged, and glad-handed his way through enthusiastic throngs of gyrating blacks. Like all liberal Democrats, Edwards is convinced that black votes are essential for the Democratic presidential nomination. Black voters, most political pundits agree, decide elections in the South. 
			</p>
			<p>
				John Edwards, like the two previous governors of South Carolina, needs remedial education about Southern politics. Ten years ago, former Republican SC governor David Beasley vowed not to tamper with the Confederate flag flying over the state capitol. When he betrayed his promise, Beasley was not reelected. His successor, the doltish Democrat Jim Hodges made a similar pledge to avoid the flag controversy. After Hodges removed the flag from the capitol dome, he too was replaced. Yet Edwards, also known as &ldquo;Johnny Prance and Dance&rdquo; in North Carolina, has decided to make the same mistake. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Using language straight from the NAACP handbook, Edwards declared that the Confederate flag should be <a href="https://washingtontimes.com/national/20040125-114713-4748r.htm"> banned from all public places</a>. Edwards has also stated that he will honor the NAACP boycott of South Carolina by staying in private homes during his campaign. The NAACP launched the boycott after the Confederate flag was raised in front of the state house following its removal from atop the dome. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite his shrill rants against the Confederate colors, Edwards failed to secure an important black endorsement. Congressman James Clyburn, the most powerful black politician in the state, threw his support behind John Kerry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One political pollster noted that elections in South Carolina are decided by several thousand swing voters. These same voters ousted two governors for disrespecting the Confederate flag. Edwards will be no different. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that Edwards&rsquo; views on the flag have been widely reported, the Democratic candidates can count on the White swing to come out and slam Johnny Prance and Dance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Knowing as we do the tendencies of White voters in South Carolina, the C of CC predicts, with complete impartiality, that Edwards will lose to the winner by at least three percentage points. He may not even come in second if the anti-Edwards vote goes to Howard Dean. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republicans and Democrats share one thing in common &mdash; both parties are self-delusional where black voters and the Confederate flag are concerned. Both parties believe blacks are necessary to win elections, and neither party will admit that a negative view of the Confederate flag can cost them at the ballot box.
