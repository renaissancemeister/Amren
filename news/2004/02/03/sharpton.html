				<b> FEC Complaint Details Illegal Travel, Contributions and High Living</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>National Legal and Policy Center, Feb. 2</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Washington, DC &mdash; The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) today filed a formal <a href="/pdfs/Sharpton2-2-04.pdf">Complaint</a> with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against Rev. Al Sharpton, his presidential exploratory committee, and businessman LaVan Hawkins. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Complaint is the second NLPC has filed against Sharpton. The first resulted in a Conciliation Agreement under which Sharpton has to pay a $5,500 fine for late filing of disclosure documents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Complaint alleges numerous violations of federal election law, including a failure to disclose in-kind contributions, a failure to disclose expenditures, and the acceptance of contributions in excess of legal limits. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Complaint also cites a questionable &ldquo;consulting fee&rdquo; of $25,000 paid to Sharpton personally by Mr. Hawkins&rsquo; company, and suspicious campaign contributions by Hawkins&rsquo; employees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In one instance, Sharpton did not report any in-kind contributions for an Atlanta fundraising event hosted by Hawkins in early 2003. According to an April 2003 Ebony magazine article, Hawkins &ldquo;spared no expense.&rdquo; Sharpton was transported to the event in the Hawkins Food Group private jet, along with Hawkins&rsquo; personal chef, who was picked up in Detroit. Guests enjoyed fresh crab cakes and beef tenderloin, &ldquo;washed down by $200 bottles of Cristal champaign.&rdquo; Hawkins and his wife have contributed the legal maximum of $2,000 each to Sharpton&rsquo;s campaign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the same Ebony article, &ldquo;Hawkins worked the crowd, at times talking business and world politics with guests, at other times, seeming to &ldquo;shake down&rdquo; guests for donations.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Media reports indicate that Sharpton may have visited over 100 cities related to his presidential campaign in 2002 and 2003. This extensive political travel is not reflected anywhere in Sharpton&rsquo;s FEC filings. In response to the first NLPC Complaint against Sharpton, the FEC cited to Sharpton the requirement for a potential candidate who becomes a candidate to report all previous contributions and expenditures on the first report. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is also the question of the $25,000 paid to Sharpton by Hawkins Food Group for &ldquo;consulting.&rdquo; According to the Complaint, &ldquo;While Al Sharpton has been described in many ways, &ldquo;business consultant&rdquo; is not the term that typically is used. This payment by an individual who subsequently became a major donor and then some to Sharpton&rsquo;s campaign is all the more questionable given the statement by the Sharpton campaign that records for some of his &ldquo;consulting&rdquo; work were destroyed in a fire which also destroyed other records about honoraria and income earned by Sharpton.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1997, Sharpton also used the excuse of a fire, claiming that records had been destroyed relating to his nonprofit group, the National Action Network, just after he had promised to make the records public. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Complaint, NLPC Chairman Ken Boehm concludes, &ldquo;At its core, this case illustrates the calculated and willful violation of two of the pillars of campaign finance law: contribution limits and financial disclosure&hellip;The Sharpton campaign has brazenly sought to run an off-the-books campaign. The evidence is overwhelming and beyond dispute.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				NLPC promotes ethics in public life, and sponsors the Government Integrity Project.
