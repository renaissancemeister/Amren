				But U.S. plans to send his parents back to Mexico 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Melanthia Mitchell, Associated Press, Chicago Tribune, Feb. 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SEATTLE--A Mexican who joined the U.S. Army and fought in Iraq after buying a fake green card for $50 passed a civics and history test Wednesday, clearing the way for him to become an American citizen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pfc. Juan Escalante, 19, was sworn in that afternoon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Army normally requires that any illegal immigrants who get caught after fraudulently enlisting be discharged. Once discharged, they may be deported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the military helped Escalante pursue citizenship, arguing that he was a valuable soldier who would do the country more good as a citizen than as a deported immigrant. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, authorities still plan to deport his parents. Escalante&rsquo;s attorney said he will appeal that decision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are 37,401 non-citizens in the active-duty military, and about 3,000 served in the war in Iraq. It is not known how many are illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				President Bush signed an executive order in 2002 speeding the citizenship process for active-duty personnel. The order helped Escalante avoid the long process of obtaining a green card before seeking citizenship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Escalante was 4 when he crossed illegally into the United States with his mother. He grew up in Seattle and signed a 4-year contract with the Army after graduating from high school in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He served as a mechanic in Kuwait and Iraq for four months as a member of the 1st Brigade of the Army&rsquo;s 3rd Infantry Division, which launched the ground invasion that began the war. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His parents have lived in the United States for 15 years and have two younger U.S.-born children, ages 10 and 12. An immigration judge said the couple failed to show that being sent back to Mexico would cause exceptional hardship to their younger children.
