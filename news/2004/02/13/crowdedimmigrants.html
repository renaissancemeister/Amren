			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>latimes.com, Associated Press, Feb. 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PERRIS, Calif. &mdash; More than 60 illegal immigrants held for ransom by smugglers were found crammed into a small Riverside County home Wednesday after one immigrant escaped and told authorities, officials said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Three alleged smugglers also discovered at the home were taken into custody and could face state and federal charges, said Senior Patrol Agent Richard Kite, a spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 64 men and women, from Mexico and other Central American countries, were found in a 900-square-foot home in a rural area between Riverside and Perris. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The interior of that house was in deplorable condition,&rdquo; said Cpl. Dennis Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Riverside County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. &ldquo;You can just imagine 64 people stuffed in a 900-square-foot home [with] no food, little water.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities believe that the immigrants were held captive until families or friends could pay for their release, Gutierrez said. Wrought-iron bars covered the home&rsquo;s windows, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It appears these 64 were part of an elaborate alien smuggling operation,&rdquo; Kite said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The discovery came after a man escaped from the house and alerted a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy about 2:30 p.m. of &ldquo;coyotes,&rdquo; or smugglers, holding him and others against their will, Gutierrez said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Border Patrol agents assisted by sheriff&rsquo;s officials later raided the home, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No major injuries were reported.
