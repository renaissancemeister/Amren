				Serial Rapist Guilty on 102 Charges
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>iafrica.com, Feb. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Serial paedophile rapist Fanwell Khumalo has been found guilty of 102 crimes by the Johannesburg High Court, and acquitted of a further 30 in a judgment that finished on Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Khumalo will be sentenced in late March. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Judgment started on Thursday of last week and lasted more than 20 court hours. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Judge Max Labe and assessors have unanimously found Khumalo guilty of 37 rapes, 30 kidnappings, eight robberies and 17 indecent assaults. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Khumalo still maintains his innocence, despite 23 DNA matches between him and specimens taken from his victims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The court heard that he led a double life between 1997 and 2001 &mdash; an acclaimed chef and married father on the one hand and a rapacious sexual monster targeting school girls on the other. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Victim after victim told the court their attacker had a squint eye and a slight limp. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He often told them that he was a policeman and that he was armed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All but one of the girls Khumalo attacked was aged between seven and 13. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The exception was a 20-year-old Khumalo claimed he had paid for sex. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The court rejected his defence and convicted him of raping her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the testimony, during which the 42 victims who gave evidence often pointed at him, he mostly looked down or wore spectacles minimising his squint. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Khumalo also annoyed the judge but denying both the squint and limp. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 43rd witness was so overcome by her experiences that she was unable to go into the witness box. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Labe criticised The Sowetan newspaper for publishing interviews with Khumalo on Monday and Tuesday, threatening legal steps against the daily. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is unheard of that an accused is interviewed while judgment is given,&rdquo; Labe said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reporter responsible was not in court. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Labe also took issue with a report in The Star, requesting the paper to correct a misleading impression that Khumalo infected the 20-year-old victim with HIV.

			</p>
			<p>
				A 14-year-old has been arrested in connection with the rape of three girls last Friday, Limpopo police said on Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The girls were tied to a tree at knifepoint outside the village of Mokoena-ko-Maswekeng near Dendron and raped one by one, police spokesperson Captain Mohale Ramatseba said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy allegedly threatened them not to tell anyone but they told their parents and the boy was arrested. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The girls are aged 11, 12 and 13.

				Nurse Appears for Child&rsquo;s HIV Injection
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i> iafrica.com, Feb. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Limpopo nurse accused of injecting her four-year-old stepson with HIV-positive blood appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court on Tuesday, SABC television news reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It said her bail had been extended and she would again appear at the end of next month. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The woman allegedly stole contaminated blood from work and injected her stepson with it.
