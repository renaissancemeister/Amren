				Court Backs Mo. Firing Over Racist Remark
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jim Suhr, AP, Las Vegas Sun, Feb. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				ST. LOUIS (AP) &mdash; A Missouri appeals court upheld the firing of a teacher who told her eighth-grade class she opposed interracial marriage and believed such couples should be &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; to prevent them from having children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The attorney for teacher Jendra Loeffelman pledged to appeal the unanimous ruling by the three-judge Missouri Court of Appeals panel. Her attorney, Chuck Ford, said he would ask the entire court to hear the case or seek a state Supreme Court review. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling affirms one last summer by a Jefferson County judge, who found that the Crystal City School Board was within its rights in ousting Loeffelman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her attorneys argued her reported classroom comments were constitutionally protected free speech. The appellate court rejected that Tuesday, declaring that the First Amendment right applied only to public concerns &mdash; not Loeffelman&rsquo;s discussing a private matter that was not part of the lesson plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Loeffelman, the ruling suggested, also should have understood her comments could be harmful to the pupils, who included two biracial students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Linda Schilly, the school board&rsquo;s president, welcomed the ruling as affirmation that Loeffelman&rsquo;s firing was just, though &ldquo;very unfortunate.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ford countered that &ldquo;This was not about a racist teacher discriminating; it&rsquo;s about a teacher giving an opinion to a student who asked a question about an assignment in another class.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Maurice Watson, the school district&rsquo;s attorney, said Loeffelman&rsquo;s comments &ldquo;can only be described as egregious&rdquo; and &ldquo;reflect a perverse, private point of view that had no legal protection in school.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Loeffelman, 53, told students in October 2002 that she was &ldquo;totally against&rdquo; interracial marriage, that interracial couples shouldn&rsquo;t have children because they often get teased, and that mixed-race children were &ldquo;racially confused.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Parents and students said Loeffelman also said mixed-race students came to school dirty and are never accepted by society.
