			<h1>
				Cost Rains on Texas Independence Parade
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Houston Chronicle, Associated Press, Feb. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				AUSTIN &mdash; The annual Texas Independence Day parade in the state capital has been canceled following the City Council&rsquo;s decision against sponsoring the event. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, council members will decide Thursday whether they made the wrong decision in January to not help pay for the parade and fun run. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Celebrate Texas, a nonprofit group, would have to spend $11,800 for the parade and run this year &mdash; up from the $5,000 it paid last year, said state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, a board member of Celebrate Texas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				City officials estimated that both events would cost about $12,500. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s especially sad for me,&rdquo; said Barrientos, D-Austin, who called the decision a &ldquo;terrible shame&rdquo; for the state capital. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Barrientos, who sponsored legislation last year to make March &ldquo;Texas History Month,&rdquo; announced the decision to cancel the parade Monday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Celebrate Texas will still have events next week, including a memorial for Texas Revolution soldiers and a celebration at the Capitol on March 2. The group had organized the parade since 2000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city currently co-sponsors events for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Cinco de Mayo, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Mexican Independence Day and Veterans Day. Councilman Brewster McCracken said the city is trying to resolve the issue quickly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This was something we were not aware of as an issue,&rdquo; McCracken told the Austin American-Statesman in today&rsquo;s editions. &ldquo;We acted immediately upon learning about it.&rdquo;
