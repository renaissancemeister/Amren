			<h1>
				Suit: TV Show Demeans Voodoo
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				An advocacy group for African religions contends that the Sci Fi Channel series degrades the religion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Joseph A. Slobodzian, Philadelphia Inquirer Online, Feb. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Philadelphia-based advocacy group for African religions yesterday sued Universal Studios and producers for cable&rsquo;s Sci Fi Channel, contending that a forthcoming &ldquo;reality series&rdquo; demeans and misrepresents the voodoo religion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The federal lawsuit filed by the National African Religion Congress Inc. against Universal Studios Inc., USA Cable Entertainment, and House of Eleven Productions seeks a court order requiring the producers of <i>Mad Mad House</i> to change their advertising and programming. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People already have negative feelings about this religion without a program like this exacerbating things,&rdquo; said George Ware, president of the five-year-old congress. The congress claims 4,500 members representing such religions as Akan, the Orisa Tradition of Trinidad and Tobago, Ifa, Santeria-Yoruba, voodoo, Candomble and Lucumi, including 500 in the tristate Philadelphia area. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In promotions in print and on cable, Sci Fi describes <i>Mad Mad House</i>, premiering March 4, as a reality series in which &ldquo;10 everyday people&rdquo; move into a house run by &ldquo;five genuine practitioners of alternative lifestyles.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The &ldquo;Alts&rdquo; &mdash; a vampire, Wiccan, naturist, voodoo priestess and modern primitive &mdash; put their 10 guests through &ldquo;tolerance testing activities,&rdquo; one promotion says, and then vote weekly to decide who is banished and who ultimately wins a $100,000 prize. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawsuit contends that the program&rsquo;s voodoo priestess, Iya Ta&rsquo;Shia Asanti, is actually a priestess of &ldquo;Yemoja in the Ifa tradition,&rdquo; a faith of the Yoruba people of Africa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asanti does not dress as a voodoo priestess, the lawsuit continues, and a commercial showing participants being placed into a pit and covered with animal parts and entrails does not represent voodoo or Ifa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokesman for producers Arthur Smith and Kent Weed in Los Angeles referred questions to Universal&rsquo;s offices for the Sci Fi Channel in New York. Kat Stein, a senior vice president for communications, said she could not comment on the suit before consulting with the channel&rsquo;s lawyers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawsuit contends that producers reached an agreement with Asanti only after Gro Mambo Angela Novanyon, a recognized Haitian voodoo high priestess in Philadelphia who founded the congress, refused to participate in <i>Mad Mad House</i>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawsuit asks for a federal judge to require the producers of <i>Mad Mad House</i> to properly identify Asanti as an Ifa, not a voodoo, priestess and prohibit them from &ldquo;airing any episode&hellip; that falsely portrays any practice of African-based religions.&rdquo;
