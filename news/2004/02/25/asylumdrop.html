			<h1>
				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3516369.stm">Asylum Applications Fall by 20%</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				The number of people seeking asylum in industrialised countries in 2003 has fallen, with EU countries recording a particularly substantial drop. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Feb. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A report by the UN&rsquo;s refugee agency reveals that the number of asylum seekers arriving in the world&rsquo;s richest 36 countries fell by 20% overall. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the lowest number since the end of the Bosnia conflict. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UNHCR hopes the new figures will encourage EU member states to focus on the need to protect refugees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2003 Britain received the largest number of applications &mdash; 61,050 including dependents. But this was a reduction of 41% on the previous year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The US, which was just behind with 60,700 applications, also received fewer applicants on 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Russians make up the largest number of asylum seekers &mdash; most of them are believed to come from the Republic of Chechnya. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Applications from Iraqis, who were the largest group in 2002, has fallen by 50%. There were similar decreases in applicants from Angola and Sierra Leone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UNHCR attributes the drop to improved conditions to improved conditions in countries such as the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the agency warns that stability in many areas remains fragile and requires continued international support. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&lsquo;Highly politicised&rsquo; </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The forthcoming expansion of the European Union has made the issue of asylum seekers a major political topic for countries within the current union. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are suggestions that large numbers of people from the former communist states will be tempted by jobs with higher wages and more generous benefits in the existing member states. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UN Refugee Agency is concerned that genuine refugees are being forgotten amid this recent controversy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A UNHCR spokesman, Rupert Colville, told the BBC the &ldquo;highly politicised&rdquo; debate on immigration was damaging the case of genuine asylum seekers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the last few years, unfortunately, and sometimes deliberately I would say, the picture has been distorted by some media &mdash; tabloids in Britain, for example &mdash; by some politicians,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become more of a kind of anti-foreigner issue, rather than a pure refugee issue.&rdquo;
