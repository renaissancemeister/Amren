			<h1>
				Was it Racism or Politics that Led to Man&rsquo;s Firing?
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Steve Blow, The Dallas Morning News, Feb. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Something is seriously wrong here. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Either I&rsquo;m not hearing the full story &mdash; or racial and political sensitivities at Southwest Airlines are badly out of whack. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I fear it&rsquo;s the latter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jeff Bogg worked almost 16 years in Southwest&rsquo;s maintenance department. He was a quality-control supervisor, overseeing about 10 people. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His work record is unblemished, he said. &ldquo;The only thing you would find in my file is commendations.&rdquo; Several of his co-workers said Mr. Bogg, 48, was one of the best-liked, most-respected employees in the department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But a silly remark at a Christmas party has cost him his job. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To back up a little, Mr. Bogg and his wife took their daughter to a Christmas party for handicapped children on Dec. 5. Their daughter is mentally disabled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A photographer was there taking pictures of the children with Santa Claus. &ldquo;Instead of saying &lsquo;Say cheese&rsquo; to the kids, he was saying &lsquo;Say monkey.&rsquo; And the kids would laugh real big,&rdquo; Mr. Bogg said. &ldquo;My wife and I talked about what a good line that was to get a smile.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				You can probably see where this is headed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The next night was the maintenance department&rsquo;s big Christmas party at the Wyndham Anatole. It&rsquo;s a lively, hard-drinking sort of affair. And during the course of the evening, Mr. Bogg passed by a fellow employee who was there with several family members. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Someone was taking their picture, and as Mr. Bogg walked by, he blurted out, &ldquo;Smile! Say monkey!&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a black family. Both the fellow employee, Kevin West, and another family member informed Mr. Bogg that his remark was offensive and not appreciated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I told them both, &lsquo;I apologize. I assure you I didn&rsquo;t mean anything by that,&rsquo; &ldquo; Mr. Bogg said. &ldquo;We went on our way, and I really thought that was the end of it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But at work a day or two later, he was summoned to meet with a young staff member from Southwest&rsquo;s human-relations department. &ldquo;She said there had been a complaint, and I told her everything that happened &mdash; including about the party the previous night. I told her there was no racial intent and that I apologized immediately.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bogg said he told her he would be happy to apologize again to Mr. West or write him a letter of apology. But she told him not to do that because any contact might be misconstrued as retaliation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The staff member gave Jeff the impression that she was satisfied with his explanation and that little more would come of it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Termination letter 
			</p>
			<p>
				But one day last month, he was called into a vice president&rsquo;s office and handed a letter. &ldquo;I looked at it and couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes. It said &lsquo;Letter of Termination.&rsquo; &ldquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The letter said, &ldquo;&hellip; It was alleged that during the course of a photo session involving an African American Employee and his family, you used the word &lsquo;monkey,&rsquo; to which the Employee and his family took great offense. During the investigation into the matter, you admitted to using it toward the Employee and his family; however, you denied that it was meant to be derogatory.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The letter goes on: &ldquo;Jeff, your behavior during the Christmas party was not only offensive and rude, but it also created a negative environment for those who heard your comment. More importantly, your behavior blatantly flies in the face of several Company and Departmental policies. &hellip; In a nutshell, Jeff, your behavior showed lack of respect and extremely poor judgment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Based on the foregoing, we have determined to terminate your employment effective immediately.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jeff was dumbfounded. &ldquo;They took something that was just like &lsquo;Say cheese&rsquo; and made it something ugly. It was not racist. It was not meant to be racist. It was having a good time at a Christmas party.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				I telephoned Mr. West, the other employee involved, to hear his side. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it because it has already been resolved, and the company has done what they thought was right,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I asked if he thought the firing was proper. &ldquo;My brother and I, my family and I, feel very good about what the company did,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Did senator intervene? 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was interesting that Mr. West brought up his brother. That&rsquo;s another wrinkle to this story. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I asked if he was referring to state Sen. Royce West of Dallas. He said he was. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The feeling among Mr. Bogg&rsquo;s supporters at the airline is that intervention by the senator led to the drastic punishment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a shame that Southwest Airlines has chosen to be run by politicians,&rdquo; said Lyndon Heffernan, a Southwest mechanic and former union leader. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Heffernan was among a dozen or so mechanics who met with maintenance vice president Jim Sokol to protest Mr. Bogg&rsquo;s firing. Three people in that meeting told me that Mr. Sokol said Sen. West had called him several times about the matter &mdash; to the point of becoming a bother &mdash; but that the decision to fire Mr. Bogg was his alone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart said he couldn&rsquo;t say much about the situation since it was a personnel matter. But he said, &ldquo;That one was thoroughly &mdash; and I do mean thoroughly &mdash; investigated, and the company certainly feels the appropriate action was taken.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Stewart said the company did receive calls from Sen. West but did not consider them political pressure and they did not influence the firing decision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I would love to have had the senator&rsquo;s input, both about the party and his calls to the airline. But my repeated calls to Sen. West were not returned. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This case really comes down to intent &mdash; what Mr. Bogg was thinking when he used that word. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If he innocently blurted a word that has racial connotations, surely no one believes that is a firing offense. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And is Mr. Bogg the kind of guy who would knowingly use the word as a slur? &ldquo;Absolutely not. That&rsquo;s not me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I get along with everybody.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				I talked to four of his colleagues who agree. They&rsquo;re white, and said they have never heard him make racially disparaging remarks &mdash; and don&rsquo;t believe the &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; comment was meant as one. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bogg&rsquo;s neighbor and close friend, Spencer Hill, said the same thing. &ldquo;When I heard what happened, it just completely blew me away. That&rsquo;s just not him. I think they took that completely out of context and used it against him. This is just so wrong,&rdquo; said Mr. Hill, who happens to be black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Look, as I said at the start, I can&rsquo;t be certain I&rsquo;ve heard the whole story. I&rsquo;ve got a real passion for racial harmony, and the last thing I want to do is defend a bigot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But also because I&rsquo;ve got a passion for racial harmony, I hate to see racial sensitivity carried overboard. It&rsquo;s a good way to foster racial animosity where none existed before. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A diverse workplace is going to lead to occasional racial blunders and misunderstandings. We&rsquo;ve got to learn to work through them with calm, with conversation and with common sense. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As best I can tell, a little of that here ought to lead to a sincere apology for a foolish remark and a good man back on the job.
