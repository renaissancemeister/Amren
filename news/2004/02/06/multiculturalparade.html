				Organizers rename the O.C. event &lsquo;multicultural&rsquo; to secure funding. Critics say that devalues heritage.

				<i>Stanley Allison, Los Angeles Times, Feb. 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Orange County&rsquo;s Black History Parade has been renamed the Multicultural Parade and Faire to broaden its financial support &mdash; triggering debate in the African American community over whether the event has been culturally diluted at the expense of its soul. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Organizers say the name change also reflects the multicultural appeal of the 24-year-old parade while still highlighting the achievements and contributions of black people in America during Black History Month. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I had to change [the name] because the people that embraced me, embraced the vision I had, that came forth with dollars&rdquo; represented an ethnic rainbow, said the Rev. Willie Holmes, chairman of this year&rsquo;s parade and a pastor of Majesty International Center, a nondenominational church in Fullerton. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Others say, though, that turning the parade into a multicultural event devalues what had made it distinctive. &ldquo;It is as if the black community has become invisible,&rdquo; said the Rev. John McReynolds, senior pastor of Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana. African Americans&rsquo; &ldquo;cultural and racial distinctions have been absorbed into a cultural melting pot that has no value.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Helen Shipp, a founding member of the committee that planned the first parade in 1980, said it always invited people of other cultures to participate, but said she was initially &ldquo;ticked off&rdquo; by the name change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;For all those years, it was the Black History Parade,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why change it now?&rdquo; 
			</p>
