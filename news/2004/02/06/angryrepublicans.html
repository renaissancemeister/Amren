			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Ralph Z. Hallow and James G. Lakely, The Washington Times, Feb. 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Growing frustration over President Bush&rsquo;s immigration plan and lack of fiscal discipline came to a head behind closed doors at last weekend&rsquo;s Republican retreat in Philadelphia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				House lawmakers, stunned by the intensity of their constituents&rsquo; displeasure at some of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s key domestic policies, gave his political strategist Karl Rove an earful behind closed doors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was intense, but I was not surprised at the tone of questioning during Rove&rsquo;s session,&rdquo; said Rep. Tom Feeney, Florida Republican. &ldquo;But then this was supposed to be a no-holds-barred discussion, and our constituents are upset.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They were all over Karl on immigration and spending,&rdquo; said Rep. Tom Tancredo, Colorado Republican and a leading House proponent of controlling the nation&rsquo;s borders and curbing illegal immigration. &ldquo;This is the first time I didn&rsquo;t even have to raise the immigration issue myself. Everyone else did.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Rove addressed the retreat Jan. 29, followed by Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua B. Bolten the next day and Mr. Bush on Saturday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no great secret that some members of Congress don&rsquo;t agree with every single thing the president is doing,&rdquo; said White House spokesman Trent Duffy. &ldquo;But he is trying to lead the country, to broaden the party. He promoted his ideas and his agenda for those in the room.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				By most accounts, Mr. Rove and Mr. Bolten received the worst of it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I would not say we jumped all over Karl, but we did have a very pointed discussion about the concerns we are hearing from our base,&rdquo; said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Most of our members are very concerned about what they perceived as amnesty for illegal aliens under the president&rsquo;s immigration proposal,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blackburn, adding that she made it &ldquo;very clear&rdquo; to Mr. Rove that &ldquo;this is something I&rsquo;m not going to support.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said spending is another issue that lawmakers told Mr. Rove they were concerned about. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of the 218 Republicans at the retreat said immigration and overspending had emerged as the top two issues in their home districts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I just got the results of a poll in our district, and it&rsquo;s 2-to-1 against the president&rsquo;s immigration plan,&rdquo; a House member said confidentially. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Rove gave a presentation defending the president&rsquo;s agenda, then fielded questions from the lawmakers attending the annual meeting of all Republicans in the House. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bolten spent about three hours with the assembled lawmakers, explaining and defending the president&rsquo;s spending plan, said those who attended. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I would say 97 out of 100 of our members who asked questions laid into him pretty good about spending and the lack of discipline on the administration&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; Mr. Feeney said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I felt like the message had been sent from the people [that Republican lawmakers] had relied on for votes &mdash; not just from disgruntled conservatives in the conference,&rdquo; Mr. Feeney said. &ldquo;The conference has deep concerns about the Medicare prescription-drug benefits and that we need to get focused on what we stand for as Republicans.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The president&rsquo;s 2005 budget proposed a growth in non-homeland defense discretionary spending of less than one half of 1 percent, an area where most Republican lawmakers want a freeze. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They certainly talked about fiscal discipline, and the president said this is going to be a tough year,&rdquo; said Mr. Duffy, the White House spokesman. &ldquo;The highway bill is going to be the first test, and we do have to control spending.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the days since the president and his top advisers heard the complaints from lawmakers in their own party, the White House position has changed, several members said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The White House &ldquo;has told us they will support a freeze if we have the votes, but some of us want the president to take the lead on this,&rdquo; confided a Republican House member who has been negotiating with the administration on the budget. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many House critics of the Bush immigration plan said privately that the proposal was created to win Mr. Bush a larger share of the Hispanic vote in November and to mollify Mexican President Vicente Fox. Mr. Fox has supported relaxed U.S. immigration laws as a means to alleviate economic problems in Mexico. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Duffy said the president delivered a passionate defense of his immigration plan, telling the Republican caucus that his policy is not a political ploy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He said he didn&rsquo;t do it for politics [but] because that&rsquo;s what he believes is good for the country,&rdquo; Mr. Duffy said, adding that Mr. Bush drove his point home by saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Texas and I know this issue.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Only one congressional Republican at the Philadelphia retreat, Florida Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, spoke in favor of the president&rsquo;s immigration proposal, several members in attendance said.
