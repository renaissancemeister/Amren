			<h1>
				Legislature: Fromhold Defends Immigrant Card Bill
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Don Jenkins, columbian.com (Clark County, WA), Feb. 6</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				OLYMPIA &mdash; Vancouver Rep. Bill Fromhold has been called some bad names since he suggested that local governments and banks accept photo IDs issued to Mexican nationals regardless of immigration status. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Pimp&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;panderer&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;whore&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;stupid bozo.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Actually, the reaction I&rsquo;ve gotten has been really pretty quiet,&rdquo; said Fromhold, a Democrat. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve got that has been negative was about a dozen e-mails or voice mails that were, frankly, derogatory.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fromhold brushed off the acrimonious opposition as &ldquo;limited and narrow&rdquo; and asked the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday to approve his House Bill 3029. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The measure would urge public agencies and financial institutions to take Mexican-government-issued cards as proof of identification. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill would only &ldquo;encourage,&rdquo; not mandate, acceptance. Fromhold calls it a &ldquo;symbolic gesture&rdquo; a statement of respect to the state&rsquo;s growing Latino population. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several banks and city governments already accept the cards. It&rsquo;s questionable how much real-world effect the bill would have. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the proposal has broached the delicate subject of helping Washington residents who are in the country illegally, but attend schools, churches and pay taxes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As long as the federal government fails to deal coherently with issues of immigration law and we have a lack of direction, I think we&rsquo;re going to struggle, and it&rsquo;s going to be an emotional issue,&rdquo; said Rep. Bruce Chandler, R-Granger. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An illegal immigrant does not risk deportation by showing up to get a Mexican ID card, called a matricular consular, at the Mexican consulate in Seattle. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Carrying a widely accepted photo ID helps illegal residents open bank accounts, cash checks, sign up for utilities and generally get along in the United States. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Latino advocacy groups testified in support of Fromhold&rsquo;s bill, and no one spoke against it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Questions from Republicans on the committee, however, suggested some disdain for the idea. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wouldn&rsquo;t someone in the country legally have a passport or other papers? asked Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Roy. &ldquo;Why would we need to have this type of identification?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Afterward, Fromhold complained that he hasn&rsquo;t been able to attract the support of GOP legislators, especially from areas with a high number of migrant workers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fromhold singled out for criticism Chandler and Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside. Both are Yakima Valley farmers who also represent southeast Clark County. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They should have their names on the bill,&rdquo; Fromhold said. &ldquo;This is not an issue they should dance around.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chandler said he didn&rsquo;t oppose the bill, though he hasn&rsquo;t heard anyone in his district say he should get behind it, either. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If I sponsor a bill, I feel an obligation to work the bill and do what I can to get it through,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a big issue for Bill (Fromhold), and I respect him for that, but I wasn&rsquo;t in position necessarily to spend time pushing the bill.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Newhouse, who&rsquo;s on the Judiciary Committee, said he probably can support the bill, though he said he&rsquo;s still trying to figure out what it would do. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The card, he noted, doesn&rsquo;t help farmers, like himself, determine whether a worker is in the country legally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It boils down to whether it&rsquo;s necessary and whether it&rsquo;s going to accomplish anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This whole immigration thing has to be sorted out and, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not on our plate to do.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				To stay alive, Fromhold&rsquo;s bill probably needs approval by today from the Judiciary Committee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The committee chairwoman, Pat Lantz of Gig Harbor, indicated support, and Democrats make up a majority of the committee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But even if the full House adopts the bill, it would have to win approval in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get real push back from the Republican side,&rdquo; Fromhold said. 
			</p>
