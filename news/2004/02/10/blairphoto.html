				Spearhead: What We Think
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>John Tyndall, Spearhead Online, Feb. 2004</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				TV viewers may have been a little curious to see Prime Minister Blair visiting Iraq last month for one of his regular addresses to the troops-addresses directed of course, to the voters at home and not to the uniformed personnel actually present on the scene. And as Tony proceeded with his imitation Agincourt speech it was noticeable that two black soldiers were seated immediately behind him to his right as he did so. Look, the ethnic minorities doing their bit for Britain! That was the obvious message. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the truth was a little less stirring. A report in <cite>The Sunday Telegraph</cite> on January 18th told the story: 
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&lsquo;A dispatch has just come through from the Basra sands that sheds intriguing new light on Tony Blair&rsquo;s cheerleading visit to the troops earlier this month. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&lsquo;One distinguished black member of the 5th Battalion of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, who had been on duty all night, had to be woken from his slumbers minutes before the PM was due to speak. &ldquo;He was brought out, dazed, to take his place among the soldiers behind the PM,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m informed. &ldquo;The photographers and cameramen were there en masse and the word had gone out that the battalion was looking &lsquo;too white.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&lsquo;There were other, equally distinguished, black soldiers in the group for the wide-angle shots. The PM&rsquo;s minders were apparently conscious of the fact that, at previous picture opportunities involving the armed forces, their man always tended to be surrounded by a sea of Anglo-Saxon faces-hardly the thing when there is a drive to recruit more soldiers from the ethnic minorities.&rsquo; 
				</p>

				Is comment really needed?

			<h3>
				Behind the top-up fees argument
			</h3>
			<p>
				There are two points of view in the present debate raging over top-up fees for university students, and to give ample voice to both of them would take a great deal more space than is available here. Speaking very generally, we believe that it is totally unacceptable to burden such students with costs for their higher education which will eat very heavily into their earnings for many years after they have graduated, and it is particularly unacceptable that the main weight of this burden will fall on students and families designated by this Labour Government as &lsquo;middle-class&rsquo;-a section of society that seems to incur the everlasting hatred of those on the political left, though most of the latter come from it themselves. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, something undoubtedly has to be done to halt the present financial drain that university education imposes on the national budget. There are numerous ways to achieve this, but there is one area of change that is vital, though almost certainly outside the range of present Labour thinking. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Labour (and, to a lesser extent, the Tories) have for a long time got it entirely wrong concerning the basic goals for the number of people to be given a university education. Tony Blair has stipulated a target of 50 per cent of the young population, and this is quite ridiculous. It is ironic that a party which constantly harps on its &lsquo;working-class&rsquo; origins seems to want to eliminate that very class as an element in society. The logic of a policy like Blair&rsquo;s is that there will be a chronic shortage of people to do the kinds of jobs for which a trade apprenticeship, rather than a university degree, is the required qualification. This is the case in many occupations already, and it is getting worse all the time. Of course, perhaps Labour welcomes this, as it provides yet another excuse for bringing in more immigrants! 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, Labour is gripped by an obsession with creating more university places for youngsters from &lsquo;poorer backgrounds&rsquo; (which is largely just code for <i>black</i> backgrounds). To achieve this, entrance standards are being dangerously lowered to the point at which almost anyone with half a brain will be able to get into university-for all the doubtful distinction that will confer upon them. Also, of course, the whole structure of university education has to be expanded at vast national cost-more universities, more buildings, more staff, more everything. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What we have to do is revise drastically our whole philosophy concerning higher education, and in the forefront of this must be an acceptance that only a minority of people in the population are really suited to it. This is not a &lsquo;class&rsquo; thing; brains and talent should have access to university places regardless of background. But the truth is that this Government is not really concerned about giving opportunity to brains and talent; it is obsessed with the social engineering involved in getting universities to grant places on a &lsquo;quota&rsquo; basis-so many for working class, middle class, poor, affluent, black, white, &lsquo;gay&rsquo; and &lsquo;straight&rsquo;-according to their perceived proportions of the general population. As far as creating a brainier, more cultured and more efficient Britain is concerned, that really doesn&rsquo;t come into it! 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Testimony of a quitter
			</h3>
			<p>
				Britain, as all but the &lsquo;cool&rsquo; will probably agree, has today become a much less agreeable place to live in than it was some thirty or more years ago. It is, moreover, a less pleasant country than many of its neighbours in Europe. It is not &lsquo;unpatriotic&rsquo; to acknowledge this; the first essential of patriotism is to recognise such things, and then to do something about them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Theodore Dalrymple, a man of medicine whose articles are regularly to be seen in the newspapers and magazines, feels the way we do about the kind of country Britain has become. He wrote about it all with great force and passion in the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> on the 17th January, and it was very difficult to disagree with a word of his assessment. He spoke of the country&rsquo;s current lack of charm. He condemned the brutalisation of life here, the vulgarity, the bad manners, the lack of self-control of so many people. He spoke of our boorish reputation abroad, of the way people in continental holiday resorts dread the coming of British visitors for the yobbish behaviour they are likely to bring with them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A great many British-far too many for comfort, Dr. Dalrymple evidently believes-have become a thoroughly reprehensible race of people, and they have imposed their standards on most of our larger towns and cities: on the streets, in nightclubs, at places of entertainment. Their imprint of nastiness and trashiness can be seen everywhere. The Doctor has a point. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He goes on to speak of &ldquo;the demagogic frivolity to which our politics have been reduced.&rdquo; Right again! He says: &ldquo;Our police veer between a kind of bullying swagger and utter unwillingness to do anything about the crime by which we are swamped.&rdquo; Who could disagree? He condemns &ldquo;the moral and intellectual corruption that pervades the public service.&rdquo; Undoubtedly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But what is Dr. Dalrymple&rsquo;s response to all this? It is a very simple one. He is going to leave this country and live in France! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Considering this last point, it seems that perhaps there is another bad feature of modern Britain that the Doctor has omitted. This is the paralysed apathy of the &lsquo;decent&rsquo; people among the population, who deplore these fallen standards but are unprepared to lift a finger to stop the fall and bring better standards back. It is the defeatist and self-centred mentality of the &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; classes, who imagine that the answer to moral and cultural squalor lies in escape instead of action. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It is very difficult to have more sympathy for the likes of Dr. Dalrymple, who very articulately spell out what is wrong with our country but do damn-all to change it, than for the people and trends in society he loathes and condemns. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The answer to the dungheap state of modern Britain is for responsible people to band together to put things right-by staying here and clearing up the mess, not flitting abroad and leaving it to others.
