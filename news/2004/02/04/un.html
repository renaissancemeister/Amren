				<a href="https://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/1/23/103603.shtml">Labor Secretary Chao: U.N. a Threat to U.S.</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Wes Vernon, NewsMax.com, Jan. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				ARLINGTON, Va. - President Bush&rsquo;s labor secretary warned a gathering of conservatives that Americans must pay more attention to the United Nations and its related organizations, which she noted were chipping away at U.S. sovereignty and threatening freedoms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, making her charges late Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, explained that powerful tax-exempt organizations were applying pressure through the U.N. to have the world body make decisions for Americans&rsquo; lives without any input from U.S. citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These efforts are being made without the knowledge of most Americans, she pointed out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chao cited a recent case where a labor union complained to the United Nations that the U.S. government was violating international law and international standards on the treatment of government employees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea that tax-exempt U.N. and allied non-government organizations would presume to dictate to Americans how they live, work and conduct themselves on their internal business was a major theme late Thursday at CPAC, not only from Secretary Chao but also from panelists who preceded her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Foreign Parasites</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tom DeWeese, president of the American Policy Center, charged that the goal of this unholy alliance was to &ldquo;erase national boundaries,&rdquo; redistribute wealth on an international scale and steer decisions on American affairs from representative government to the &ldquo;global village,&rdquo; with all of us as &ldquo;global citizens.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He and another panelist, Jeff Gayner of Americans for Sovereignty, called for the U.S. to get out of the U.N. and to force the U.N. to get out of the U.S. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Secretary Chao cited not only labor organizations but also groups in other areas of concern, such as Environmental Policy Institute and self-described human rights groups that have used their tax-exempt status to try to bring the U.S. into line with their worldview, without a single American vote being cast or even an awareness on the part of most U.S citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The long list of accredited left-of-center NGOs, she said, have become &ldquo;key players in laying the groundwork for international law&rdquo; and, she fears, &ldquo;one day, the U.S. will be pressured to adopt&rdquo; the globalist agenda without a single vote being cast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Social Engineering</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The internationalist-minded NGOs, the secretary observed, are encouraging the U.N. and its offshoot agencies to pressure the United States into policies mandating &ldquo;gender neutrality&rdquo; and &ldquo;reallocating defense expenditures for other&rdquo; left-favored causes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Conservatives who ignore the U.N. do so at their peril,&rdquo; Chao declared. 
			</p>
			<p>
				DeWeese said the international tentacles of the NGOs reached down to local governments around the country. He said they were working with city and county governments to use familiar programs to forge ahead with such ideas as &ldquo;sustainable development,&rdquo; and &ldquo;smart growth,&rdquo; euphemisms, he said, for pressuring us out of the wide-open suburbs and into crowded cities. These policies also make housing more expensive, though liberal politicians constantly bemoan the lack of &ldquo;affordable housing,&rdquo; a shortage they have abetted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you love liberty,&rdquo; the American Policy Center president told CPAC, &ldquo;sustainable development is your enemy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The job-killing, China-boosting Kyoto &ldquo;global warming&rdquo; treaty and the International Criminal Court, both rejected by President Bush, are just the tip of the iceberg, DeWeese warned. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Few Americans are aware of what is going on,&rdquo; he noted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It goes to the philosophy of these particular NGOs that all living creatures are the same, perhaps crowing humans together in cities, with the animals looking in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gayner said Americans would have to use the same mantra with international planners and their NGOs that former first lady Nancy Reagan used with the drug culture: &ldquo;Just say no.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The World Court and the International Criminal Court are building blocks to the control of the American people,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He praised President Bush for his State of the Union statement that the U.S. did not need a permission slip from foreigners to defend its own interests. Moreover, he cited polls showing near unanimity among the American people in agreement with that. Yet the pressure for world governance continues unabated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gayner urged support for a proposal by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, to end U.S. membership in the United Nations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The Enemy on U.S. Soil</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Panelist Tom Kilgannon of Oliver North&rsquo;s Freedom Alliance noted that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Anan lives &ldquo;like a king&rdquo; at the U.N., where &ldquo;Castro is a hero and George W. Bush is reviled or barely tolerated.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Kofi Anan is no friend of the American people, and the U.N. is no ally of the Untied States,&rdquo; he declared. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Secretary Chao said she was encouraged that such pro-American groups as the Heritage Foundation and the American Conservative Union had persisted in their efforts, against heavy resistance, to obtain accreditation as observers of the U.N. General Assembly.
