			<h1>
				Owner: No More Hip-Hop at Liquid
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Crystal C. Bozek, Sentinel and Enterprise Online (MA), Feb. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LEOMINSTER &mdash;  Hip-hoppers will have to look elsewhere for entertainment &mdash; Club Liquid&rsquo;s owner is changing the club&rsquo;s Thursday night format to blues and jazz. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Assistant Manager Ed Pasquarosa told license commissioners gathered Monday night at City Hall that hip-hop night was off the format since it seemed to cause the club at 54 Main St. more trouble than it was worth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Former Liquid owner Andy Rome agreed with Pasquarosa, saying the only problems he ever had at the club happened on Thursday nights. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think by changing the type of music, it&rsquo;s going to eliminate 99 and 9/10 of the problem,&rdquo; Rome said at Monday night&rsquo;s meeting. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know too many blues people that get fired up.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He added, &ldquo;The Pasquarosas are extremely responsible owners.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pasquarosa and his son, manager Rick Pasquarosa, are working with the commission to come up with a plan to prevent incidents like the melee that broke out in a parking area outside the club last November. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Leominster Police Department filed a report stating two officers were injured Nov. 28 in a 100-person brawl that ended in two arrests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Owners plan to retain a female security guard to handle security problems involving female club-goers, install a surveillance system in the parking lot and take other measures to increase security besides ditching the hip-hop format. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think these should be a given in any club that caters to large crowds where there might be flare-ups,&rdquo; Chairman Henry Lanza said of the planned precautions. &ldquo;These are very good. I just think you should have been already doing this.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rick Pasquarosa told commissioners that large crowds are not always the norm lately. About 12 people attended the club last Thursday, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last call at the club is at 1:30 a.m. Commissioners said making it a little earlier might help stop drunken fights. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When they are coming in at midnight, there&rsquo;s a reason,&rdquo; member Paul LeBlanc said, adding that employees should pay closer attention to how much people are drinking. &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re juiced up they&rsquo;re all superhumans.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lanza said the important thing was to forestall another incident like the fight in November. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t happen. You have policemen getting hurt &hellip; off the street, covering something that never should have happened,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lanza did not comment on a Feb. 13 fight outside the club, saying he will wait for a report and look at all the facts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The commission is scheduled to meet on March 8, after members review Liquid&rsquo;s plan with Mayor Dean Mazzarella and the representatives of the Leominter Police Department.
