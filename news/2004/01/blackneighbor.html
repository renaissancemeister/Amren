				Four out of 10 Whites Do not Want Black Neighbour, Poll Shows 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Vikram Dodd, The Guardian, Jan. 19 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Four out of 10 white people do not want an Asian or black Briton as their neighbour, according to a survey published this week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The opinion poll found rocketing concern about immigration and asylum combined with ignorance about basic facts about the issue and growing resentment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mori survey for Prospect magazine found that 39% of those asked would prefer to live in an area only with people from the same ethnic background. Forty-one per cent of whites and 26% of ethnic minority people surveyed wanted the races to live separately. Over half of all ethnic groups wanted to live in diverse areas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The poll found older people were most in favour of living apart from other races. Only 40% of people over 55 disagreed with the idea, compared with 64% of 16-to 34-year-olds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bobby Duffy, research director at Mori, said: &ldquo;We have overestimated the progress we have made in race and immigration issues. I&rsquo;m surprised about such a high finding as people are usually reticent because they worry about being judged by the interviewer, so this finding is worrying.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The poll shows that the issue of race and immigration has risen up the list of people&rsquo;s concerns, and is now the third most important, ahead of crime, defence and the economy. The issue is ranked the most important by 29%, behind education on 33% and the NHS on 41%. Ten years ago the figure was below 10%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mori said people had a &ldquo;inflated view of the scale of the issue&rdquo;, with people overestimating the numbers of first generation immigrants by four times the actual amount. Britons think that first generation immigrants comprise 23% of the population, while the real figure is 6%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monumental shift in people&rsquo;s concerns,&rdquo; Mr Duffy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen economic concerns decline and that seems set to continue, and a rise in concern about public services. The issue of race and immigration threatens to dwarf others.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Almost one in five people believe immigrants and asylum seekers are responsible for a loss of community spirit, though 40% believe people working longer hours is to blame, with more than a third saying that people watching television or using the internet is the reason for a drop in community cohesion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The survey also exposes simmering resentments felt by a large section of those surveyed, with nearly half believing that other people are unfairly getting priority over them in public services and welfare payments. Of the 45% who believe the welfare state treats them as second class citizens, 39% blame asylum seekers and new immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Surveys 10 years ago showed anxiety about &ldquo;freeloading&rdquo; by lone parents and the unemployed, but now asylum seekers are the focus of resentment. Among lower socio-economic classes the feeling they are losing out rises above 50%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One in five people believes immigrants should get less welfare provisions than British citizens, though there is a marked class difference. Just 12% of the top two socio-economic groups support less welfare for immigrants compared to 29% of the lowest two socio-economic groups. This is the group most likely to need welfare and most likely to read rightwing newspapers which have been accused of running a scaremongering campaign against asylum seekers and new immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The results echo the findings of a poll last year by Mori for the commission for racial equality: one-third of white respondents said they did not mix with ethnic minority people at work, and nearly two-thirds did not meet socially. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly half those polled, 47%, thought racial prejudice had increased in 10 years, compared with 29% who believed it had lessened. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mori interviewed 1,000 people by telephone across Britain in November 2003
