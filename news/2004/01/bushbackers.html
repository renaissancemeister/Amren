				<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040120-102824-5228r.htm">Bush, Backers Part Ways on Immigration Reform</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>James G. Lakely, The Washington Times, Jan. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				New polls show that President Bush&rsquo;s proposal to grant legal status to millions of illegal aliens is widely unpopular, even among his most loyal supporters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Opposition to the plan runs so deeply that the Christian Coalition of Georgia, a conservative pro-family organization, has dedicated a panel discussion for later this month that will focus on the pitfalls of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; said Phil Kent, a political consultant who hosted a Bush-Cheney fund-raiser in Atlanta earlier this month. &ldquo;Who knew that the Christian Coalition was even interested in immigration?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday showed that 56 percent of respondents disapproved of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s proposal to allow millions of illegal immigrants to gain legal status and keep their jobs. Thirty-four percent approved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Republicans were equally skeptical of the president&rsquo;s immigration plan, with 52 percent expressing disapproval and 34 percent warm to the idea. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A New York Times poll released Sunday echoed those results. Two-thirds of those polled said they disliked Mr. Bush&rsquo;s plan, and a plurality of those asked said immigration should be decreased, not increased. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Gallup/USA Today poll released Jan. 13 showed that 55 percent disapproved of legalizing illegal immigrants, with 42 percent in favor. Among low-income respondents, an even greater majority opposed the plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gallup also found that 74 percent of respondents, in general, were opposed to aiding undocumented workers, up from 67 percent who felt that way in August 2001. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The president defended his immigration proposal in his State of the Union address last night, but many conservative activists didn&rsquo;t seem ready to be convinced. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Christian Coalition of Georgia has invited Rep. Tom Tancredo, Colorado Republican and staunch critic of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s immigration proposal, to lead its panel discussion on immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Kent said he expects the normally Bush-friendly Christian Coalition crowd to be angry at what they see as a wrongheaded play by Mr. Bush&rsquo;s chief political adviser, Karl Rove, to attract Hispanic votes to the Republican ticket in November. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For each Hispanic vote gained, many more conservatives could be lost, Mr. Kent said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We would prefer that Bush win, but if Rove is going to take the base for granted, he&rsquo;s making a big mistake,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Political consultant Matt Leonardo, who has worked with many successful conservative candidates, said he does not sense the mass conservative anger others detect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Anyone looking for cracks in the base will be looking for a long time,&rdquo; Mr. Leonardo said, attributing to Mr. Bush &ldquo;a Reagan-like ability to rally the party.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This president has yet to officially make his case for the immigration plan,&rdquo; Mr. Leonardo said. &ldquo;This president has proved time and time again that once he makes his case, he&rsquo;s trusted by the public. And you&rsquo;ll see that again on immigration.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A conservative activist who has worked to help the Bush-Cheney campaign but asked not to be identified said many people with whom he talks are beginning to justify in their minds a one-term Bush presidency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As long as Republicans and conservatives keep the Congress, we can lose the White House,&rdquo; the activist said. &ldquo;Let Karl Rove put that in his pipe and smoke it, because we can use the Congress to block a Democratic president&rsquo;s judges and initiatives.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Phil Mabry, a Republican from outside Dallas who has worked for his party for 35 years, said the &ldquo;worst thing&rdquo; the Bush-Cheney campaign can do is take conservatives for granted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to lose thousands of votes that he can&rsquo;t afford to lose,&rdquo; Mr. Mabry said. &ldquo;Reagan he ain&rsquo;t and Reagan he will never be.&rdquo;
