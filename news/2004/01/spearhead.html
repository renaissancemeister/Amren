				What We Think 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<b>Nationalist Comment on the Month's News</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>John Tyndall, Spearhead Online, Jan. 2004</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>A cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for the &lsquo;anti-racists&rsquo;?</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, seemingly by Whites, in a street in Eltham, South East London, back in 1993, the British public has never been allowed to forget about the incident. With the encouragement of his politically militant mother, Lawrence has become a cult figure for &lsquo;anti-racists&rsquo; everywhere &mdash; although a racial motive in his killing is still far from certain, least of all proven. The Lawrence affair has been milked for all it is worth by the political left &mdash; and not only the left but &lsquo;liberals&rsquo; right across the spectrum. There have been marches, demonstrations, public meetings, political speeches, never-ending TV documentaries, and even TV plays on the Lawrence theme. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the element of <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> surrounding the Lawrence episode was the failure of the authorities to bring a successful prosecution against anyone for the killing. This was blamed on the local police for the allegedly casual way they handled the investigation; and &mdash; wait for it! &mdash; yes, police &lsquo;racism&rsquo; was named as a factor in all this. Indeed, the very fact that Lawrence&rsquo;s killer, whoever he or she may be, is probably still at large has been a boon to the leftist and anti-racist grudge industry in Britain: the whole saga makes so much better propaganda in consequence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But now let us shift the scene to a street in Oldham, Lancashire, one night in February 2002, where 19-year-old Gavin Hopley was walking with two friends away from a night-club. They strayed into the Glodwick area, which many members of the local Asian community regard as their own exclusive territory. The three were set upon by a gang of young Asians, and Gavin was brutally beaten. He died six days later in hospital. Gavin and his two mates were white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eight Asians were later arrested and charged with the murder but the charges were then dropped because of lack of evidence. Then the case was reopened in March 2003, when two of the Asian gang agreed to testify against one of their number, Mohsin Raza, who they claimed delivered the crucial kick which led to Gavin&rsquo;s death. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Raza walked from court free last month when a jury &mdash; including some Asian members &mdash; accepted an alibi that he had been working at an Indian restaurant at the time of the murder. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An alibi supplied by others working at the restaurant, needless to say &mdash; in other words, by Asians! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gavin&rsquo;s parents issued a public condemnation of certain members of the Asian community for protecting the culprits. &ldquo;With their evidence the outcome could have be different,&rdquo; they said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The killers of Gavin Hopley got off, just as those of Stephen Lawrence did. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But will we now see the murder of Gavin Hopley turned into a decade-long political circus, with rent-a-mob marching in the city in protest against the &lsquo;racism&rsquo; that caused this and led to the culprit not being brought to justice? Will we hear politicians making impassioned speeches about it? Will there be years of TV documentaries and plays devoted to Gavin&rsquo;s memory and the ghastly &lsquo;racism&rsquo; of those who killed him and those who protected the killers? Will Gavin Hopley become a cult figure of the &lsquo;anti-racist cause? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Something tells us that pigs growing wings and taking to the sky is more likely! 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Typical Guardian journalism</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, how&rsquo;s this for another sample of reporting by the liberal-left? An item in <cite>The Guardian</cite> of the 23rd December, written by Ted Oliver, focused on certain alleged racial incidents in Belfast &mdash; a place not normally associated with such happenings and therefore making for added sensationalism. A Ugandan family and a group of Chinese were apparently driven from their homes in a run-down southern area of the city. One of the Ugandans was a woman in an advanced state of pregnancy. Police were searching for a gang responsible and, according to the report, thought they could be &lsquo;racists&rsquo; and that groups based in England may be organising them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So what did <cite>The Guardian</cite> do? It headlined its report as follows: &ldquo;BNP could be behind brutal racist attacks in Belfast.&rdquo; Just like that! There was not a shred of real evidence that the British National Party had anything to do with the incidents. The party has a fairly small branch in Northern Ireland and from our knowledge of the people involved it is extremely unlikely that they would get up to such behaviour. &ldquo;Could be&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;May be&hellip;&rdquo; Equally, the culprits &ldquo;could be&rdquo; or &ldquo;may be&rdquo; ordinary criminals. They &ldquo;could be&rdquo; or &ldquo;may be&rdquo; little green men from Mars, for all we know. This is all these press hounds have to go on, but that doesn&rsquo;t deter them. The holier-than-thou <cite>Guardian</cite>, as an almost automatic knee-jerk reaction, decides that it is probably all down to the awful BNP! Indeed, even if the BNP was in any way responsible, the party &mdash; according to <cite>Guardian</cite> thinking &mdash; would no doubt have approved of what happened. So it&rsquo;s all perfectly fair, as in love and war, to print a headline aimed at planting in the public&rsquo;s mind that the BNP goes around ill-treating pregnant women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ain&rsquo;t we lucky to have a free press! 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Eligible to vote!</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				They&rsquo;re pouring in, as we all know. But what many do not know is that large numbers of them are getting themselves on the electoral register almost as soon as they get here! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marion Roe, Tory MP for Broxbourne (Herts.) noticed a lot of Turkish names appearing on the register in her constituency. No doubt this caused her some apprehension because she guessed most of them would vote Labour; nothing concentrates the mind of a politician better than things like this! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Roe made some enquiries and found that people get registered as voters by the simple act of filling in a form testifying to their eligibility. Theoretically, making any false declaration in this form is a criminal act and could lead to prosecution; but, as Mrs. Roe found, there is seldom any check and, even more seldom, any action if a check should find some irregularity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In protesting about all this to Broxbourne Council, she was told that it was considered &ldquo;inappropriate to investigate&rdquo; because it could be deemed racist! 
			</p>
			<p>
				So she took up the issue with the Electoral Commission, warning that in elections in marginal seats such falsely registered voters could quite easily determine the outcome. In the Commission&rsquo;s reply, its chairman Sam Younger endorsed the council&rsquo;s anxiety over &lsquo;racism&rsquo;. He went on to say: &mdash;  
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				&rsquo;If such checks were done on the basis of the appearance or sound of names, such action could well be deemed racist and in breach of the law.&rsquo; 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				So immigrants voting illegally is alright then!
