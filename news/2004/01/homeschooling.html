				<a href="https://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/colleges_home_schooling">Colleges Noticing Home Schooled Students</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				Stev Giegerich, AP, Jan. 26 
			</p>
			<p>
				Home-schooling advocate Karl Bunday used to get a lot of blank looks when he visited college fairs in his native Minnesota and pitched the virtues of students educated around the kitchen table. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly a decade later, things have changed. &ldquo;It seems like this time, everybody has heard of home schooling,&rdquo; said Bunday, who operates the Web site learninfreedom.org about &ldquo;taking responsibility for your own learning.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Until recently, educators say, home-schooled students mostly gravitated to small, primarily religious colleges. Now, as the movement keeps gaining in popularity, they can be found on many &mdash; even most &mdash; campuses nationwide. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As the numbers (of home schooled) have increased, and there have also been more admitted to college, they&rsquo;ve actually performed quite well,&rdquo; said Barmak Nassirian, a policy analyst with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While exact figures are not available, the number of middle and high school students educated at home is now estimated at between 1 million and 2 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Such young people have grown up academically with a greater emphasis on learning &mdash; rather than testing &mdash; compared with conventionally educated students, said Laura Derrick of the Home Education Network. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Derrick thinks colleges are starting to recognize that. Schools are &ldquo;looking at kids as human beings and as people who bring a specific experience to their school rather than just a grade or a grade point average,&rdquo; she said from her home in Austin, Texas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Educated at home from kindergarten through high school, Holly Porter said the flexibility of home schooling made the transition to university life easy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It prepared me better than going to a regular high school would have because I was independently motivated,&rdquo; said Porter, now a graduate student at the University of Denver. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asher Albertson was home schooled until age 16, when he started attending classes at a community college. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now a junior at the University of Wyoming, Albertson said finding his way to classrooms was the most difficult adjustment to college life. &ldquo;Before, it was the dining room table,&rdquo; he joked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Academically, Albertson added, the move to campus was nearly seamless. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In college, you go to class, but you spend most of your time studying outside of class getting ready for tests, so it wasn&rsquo;t much different from what I was doing before,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond academics, the uptick in home schooled students on college campuses has helped them overcome the stereotype that they&rsquo;re socially maladjusted, said Mark Hegener, the publisher of Home Education magazine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When Porter moved into her first undergraduate residence hall at Denver five years ago, she felt like it was the conventionally schooled freshmen who had trouble adjusting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was kind of a shock,&rdquo; she recalled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I had been given a lot of independence and a lot of freedom inside my parent&rsquo;s home. And I kind of got the feeling that there were all these girls that had never been away from their families before and they just went hog wild.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Within a week, Porter transferred to a dormitory that emphasized academics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Porter and others say the home-schooled develop their social skills through volunteerism and other networks that allow them to join in as many or more extracurricular activities than conventional students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Texas State University admissions director Christie Kangas said home schooled applicants almost always list more community service than those conventional students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nassirian said the barriers that once discouraged the home schooled from attending secular colleges began to fall five years ago after the schools overcame &ldquo;fundamental misgivings&rdquo; about applications who lacked grade transcripts and report cards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Porter encountered some of those obstacles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;On paper, I looked like a high school dropout,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I had a (high school equivalency diploma) but I didn&rsquo;t do an accredited high school curriculum. So I had to explain that I&rsquo;m not a high school dropout &mdash; that I have had a lot of unique experiences that a regular high school student doesn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tom Bear, dean of admissions at the University of Evansville, credits home-schooled students&rsquo; strong performances on standardized tests for changing their image. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, applicants to Evansville &mdash; a private institution in southern Indiana &mdash; must submit a reference from a coach, minister or another source. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have some checks and balances in place,&rdquo; Bear said. &ldquo;But the home schooled kids who are here have done well.&rdquo;
