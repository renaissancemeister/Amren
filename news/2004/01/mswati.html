			<h1>
				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3420775.stm">Swazi Schools Closed for Weeding</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Thulani Mthethwa, BBC News, Jan. 22 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Swaziland&rsquo;s schoolboys are coming to the end of a fortnight spent weeding the king&rsquo;s fields, which led to the postponement of the new school term. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Schools were supposed to reopen on Tuesday but King Mswati ordered that they stay closed for an extra week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The weeding of the 10 vast royal fields is due to come to an end on Friday, before the king makes a public speech. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some 30,000 children were affected by the order but not the king&rsquo;s children who are in private schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some parents complained about the short notice of the royal order, which was issued by the king the day before schools were supposed to reopen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ellen Mavuso of Pigg&rsquo;s Peak, in northern Swaziland, complained that she had already taken her two daughters to school in the south of Swaziland, about 120 kilometres from home, only to be told of the order. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She wondered how the weeding of royal fields was related to the opening of schools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				King Mswati III is Africa&rsquo;s last absolute monarch. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier this month, he asked the government of the drought-hit country for $15m to build new palaces for his 11 wives.
