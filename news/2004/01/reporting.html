				<a href="https://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/state/7743337.htm">Judge Accused of Abusing Power by Reporting Immigrant Children</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<b>Judge Roger B. Colton has come under fire for reporting children that appear in his courtroom to immigration officials.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>The Miami Herald, Jan. 19, 2004</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>WEST PALM BEACH</b> &mdash; A judge is being criticized for openly questioning and often reporting the immigration status of abused, abandoned and neglected children in his courtroom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some lawyers call Roger B. Colton&rsquo;s actions disturbing, saying he abuses his power by revealing to law enforcement details disclosed before him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colton says he is just doing his duty. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They&rsquo;re violating the law, and I&rsquo;m a judge,&rdquo; said Colton, whose background included nine years as a special agent with the FBI. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I have some type of obligation to the system to report it . . . when it&rsquo;s smack-dab right out in front of me?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				At least four times since October, Colton has written down names, addresses and birth dates of immigrant children and their families and faxed it to the U.S. Border Patrol. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Barbara White, chief of the public defender&rsquo;s juvenile division, says it is inappropriate for judges in any courtroom to report people to law enforcement. Most certainly not in a juvenile setting, where the clients are the most vulnerable, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most lawyers interviewed declined to comment on the record for fear of hurting their clients&rsquo; cases. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A former member of the governing board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said Colton&rsquo;s practice is &ldquo;shocking.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken upon himself a duty he was not sworn to do,&rdquo; said Mazen Sukkar, an immigration lawyer in Hollywood. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a state judge enforcing federal law.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				By turning in illegals, Colton could prompt immigrants to stop coming forward as witnesses in cases, Sukkar said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Legally, Colton is on firm ground, said Mike Hethmon, staff attorney for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A recent federal court ruling in eastern Virginia supports a judge&rsquo;s ability to report immigration information to law enforcement, Hethmon said.
