				<b>1 in 3 African-Americans say they have been mistreated by police</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Geoff Larcom, The Ann Arbor News, Jan. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly one out of three African-Americans report that they have been unfairly stopped, searched and physically abused or threatened by the police, according to a University of Michigan study. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The study of a national sample of more than 6,000 people is the most recent to detail different levels of major discrimination, racial attitudes and exposure to everyday stress among black and white Americans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				U-M researchers say the study shows that African-Americans are much less likely today than they were in 1980 to believe that whites want to see them get a better break in life. Researchers noted that 14.4 percent of African-Americans today thought most white people wanted to see blacks get a better break, compared to 22.6 percent in 1980. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These findings show that black Americans today continue to face substantial levels of racism and discrimination that may well turn out to have direct effects on physical and mental health,&rdquo; said James Jackson, a senior research scientist at the U-M Institute for Social Research who headed up the study. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The survey, released Thursday, was funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted between February 2001 and March 2003. Among its findings: 
			</p>
			<p>
				28.2 percent of African-Americans, 27.5 percent of Afro-Caribbeans and 17 percent of whites said they had been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened or abused by the police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In response to a question about how often certain things happen in their everyday lives, about 23 percent of African-Americans reported that people acted as if they were not smart several times a month or more, compared with 19 percent of Afro-Caribbeans and only about 10 percent of whites. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly 15 percent of African-Americans and Afro-Caribbeans, compared to only about 1 percent of whites, said they were followed around in stores a few times a month or more by store employees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the area of mental health, researchers said the survey showed surprisingly low rates of depression among African-American men and exceptionally low rates of all mental health problems, except post-traumatic stress disorder, among Afro-Caribbean women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The study also shows that African-American women are nearly twice as likely as African-American men to have suffered a bout of major depression sometime in their lives (13.1 percent vs. 7.4 percent). 
			</p>
			<p>
				By contrast, 10 percent of Afro-Caribbean women and 12.6 percent of Afro-Caribbean men report suffering from major depression sometime in their lives, compared to 20.1 percent of white women and 16.1 percent of white men surveyed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The study is the first known to include a national probability sample of blacks of Caribbean ancestry. Overall, 58 percent of the people interviewed were African-American, 26 percent were black with Caribbean ancestry and 16 percent were non-Hispanic whites. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jackson noted the striking differences shown between African-Americans and Afro-Caribbeans. &ldquo;Our data show that the simplistic notion of a black-and-white world is no longer tenable,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jackson said that Afro-Caribbeans experience living conditions that are very different from most native-born African-Americans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you live under very stressful conditions, you have to work harder to maintain your mental health,&rdquo; he said.
