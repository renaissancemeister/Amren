			<h1>
				Trouble ahead 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Online Sun, Britain</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>THERE is no doubting the desperate plight of the impoverished Roma gipsies.</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				They are starving, they are sick and they are racially persecuted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But is giving all 1.5million of them the right to come to Britain from May 1 going to help? 
			</p>
			<p>
				We scarcely have the health, education and welfare resources to cope with numbers we already have. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prime Minister&rsquo;s generosity in granting the Romas full citizens&rsquo; rights may be Christian charity but it could be a human catastrophe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Germany, France, Italy and Spain have told the poor of Eastern Europe they must wait seven years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Understandably, the Romas will head for the only countries which will provide an instant haven, Britain and Ireland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Why could we not have had proper quotas, regulated by visas? 
			</p>
			<p>
				If the influx of those in need was spread over several years, it would be much easier to give effective aid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We could have made sure that those parts of south-east England which have been blighted by illegal immigrants would not be invaded by those who, while entering legally, place huge demands on resources. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Britain can be proud of the way it has always welcomed the troubled and the destitute. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>It will be a crying shame if the nation&rsquo;s goodwill is stretched to breaking point.</strong>
