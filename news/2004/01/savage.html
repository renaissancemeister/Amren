			<p class="subhead">
				Opposes &lsquo;amnesty&rsquo; plan: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a grass-roots revolution&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&copy; 2004 WorldNetDaily.com, Jan. 27 
			</p>
			<p>
				After calling for the impeachment of President Bush over plans to legalize millions of illegal aliens, talk-radio star Michael Savage has taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times declaring millions of Americans support his view. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ad features his new best-selling book, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.shopnetdaily.com/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1395">The Enemy Within</a>,&rdquo; published by <a href="http://www.wndbooks.com/">WND Books</a>, which contends America&rsquo;s biggest enemy is not al-Qaida, but &ldquo;internal enemies&rdquo; that threaten the nation&rsquo;s long-term survival. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since Sunday, about 10,000 people have requested a copy of the ad for their own use. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They are going to be posting them all across America,&rdquo; Savage told WorldNetDaily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a grass-roots revolution.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				During his Jan. 12 broadcast, Savage, who supports the president on many issues, called Bush a liberal and described him as part of the &ldquo;enemy within&rdquo; that is destroying the nation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is the worst betrayal of our country in my lifetime,&rdquo; said Savage, whose program is heard on more than 350 stations with an audience reaching some 6 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His previous book, <a href="http://www.shopnetdaily.com/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1037">&ldquo;The Savage Nation,&rdquo; </a>last year was No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller&rsquo;s list for five weeks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is much more serious than dropping your pants for an intern,&rdquo; said Savage. &ldquo;This is a policy that represents a danger to national security.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush has proposed sweeping immigration changes that would allow the 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens thought to be in the United States to remain in the country if they have a job and apply for a guest-worker card. The immigrants could stay for renewable three-year periods, after which they could apply for permanent legal residence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Savage is hardly alone in his strong feelings of opposition to Bush&rsquo;s proposal to offer legal status to illegal immigrants. An ABC News poll finds 52 percent of the nation opposes an amnesty program for illegal immigrants from Mexico, while 57 percent oppose one for illegal immigrants from other countries. Both results are roughly the same as when the administration floated the idea two-and-a-half years ago. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During his recent trip to Monterrey, Mexico, Bush reaffirmed his support of the proposal, despite its unpopularity at home. He said it could help illegal immigrants &ldquo;leave the shadows and have an identity.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				At a joint press conference with Mexican President Vicente Fox, Bush warned that his government will not allow the existence in the United States of an underclass of illegal immigrants, but claimed again his proposal is not an amnesty. Amnesty, he said, would only promote the violation of the law and perpetuate illegal immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush said his immigration proposal would benefit both the United States and Mexico as it recognizes the contribution of thousands of honest Mexicans who work in the United States. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For his part, Fox embraced Bush&rsquo;s proposal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What else can we wish?&rdquo; Fox said at the news conference with the president. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the U.S., a recent poll on the controversy shows at least twice as many Americans &ldquo;strongly&rdquo; oppose the proposal as strongly support it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Opposition peaks in Bush&rsquo;s own party: Fifty-eight percent of Republicans oppose his immigration proposal for Mexicans, compared with 50 percent of Democrats. For illegal immigrants other than Mexicans, 63 percent of Republicans are opposed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, the National Border Patrol Council, which represents all 9,000 of the Border Patrol&rsquo;s non-supervisory agents, has told its members to challenge President Bush&rsquo;s proposed guest-worker program, calling it a &ldquo;slap in the face to anyone who has ever tried to enforce the immigration laws of the United States,&rdquo; the Washington Times reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Savage cited a new report published in the City Journal by the Manhattan Institute suggesting there is a major crime wave in the U.S. caused by illegal immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Some of the most violent criminals at large today are illegal aliens,&rdquo; the report charges. &ldquo;Yet in cities where the crime these aliens commit is highest, the police cannot use the most obvious tool to apprehend them: their immigration status. In Los Angeles, for example, dozens of members of a ruthless Salvadoran prison gang have sneaked back into town after having been deported for such crimes as murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and drug trafficking. Police officers know who they are and know that their mere presence in the country is a felony. Yet should a cop arrest an illegal gang-banger for felonious reentry, it is he who will be treated as a criminal, for violating the LAPD&rsquo;s rule against enforcing immigration law.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The situation is similar, the report says in New York, Chicago, San Diego, Austin and Houston. These &ldquo;sanctuary policies&rdquo; generally prohibit city employees, including the cops, from reporting immigration violations to federal authorities, says the report. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These people are destroying America,&rdquo; said Savage. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I have to say on the subject. But you can talk about it. Talk about it while you can - while America is still a free country, because it&rsquo;s not going to last.&rdquo;
