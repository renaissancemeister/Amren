				<a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/01/12/nrace12.xml">Thugs drive out blacks in Belfast &lsquo;ethnic cleansing&rsquo;</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Thomas Harding, telegraph.co. uk, Jan. 12, 2004</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Racist thugs in Northern Ireland are forcing black people out of their homes in part of an apparently orchestrated plan to &ldquo;ethnically cleanse&rdquo; Belfast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ethnic minority leaders have called for urgent Government action to combat the wave of assaults and forced evictions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With about one attack a day, race crime has risen by more than 900 per cent since the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, as loyalist paramilitaries appear intent on forcing the immigrant population out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The concerted attacks have been particularly focused in south Belfast where Asians, Chinese and Africans have been targeted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In typical Belfast fashion the actions have been reinforced with graffiti of &ldquo;Keep the Streets White&rdquo; and more sinisterly a &ldquo;Whites Only&rdquo; message scrawled outside a primary school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Non-white faces are unfamiliar in Northern Ireland whose 1.7 million population is 99.15 per cent white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The next biggest grouping is Chinese (0.25 per cent), who have been there since the 1960s, and there are just 2,600 Africans. In one incident a South African woman, who had survived Soweto during apartheid, was attacked inside her home in the staunchly loyalist Village area in south Belfast. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tandy, who did not want her surname published, answered a knock at the door to a group of men who shouted &ldquo;get the f*** out of here&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She ran out of the back door leaving behind her children, aged 13 and two, who remained silent upstairs as the family&rsquo;s television, kitchen, fireplace and new electronic games console were smashed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tandy, who moved to Belfast a year ago to study for a psychology degree, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to this coming from South Africa. I grew up to racism but I am fed up with it here. I wanted to breathe the fresh air here but then I came across racism again. It&rsquo;s a terrible experience.&rdquo; She now plans to leave Northern Ireland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An estate agent has also been threatened with having his business destroyed if he continued to let houses to ethnic minorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				William Faulkner was told by the Ulster Volunteer Force to stop renting homes to Chinese and black people. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Loyalist paramilitaries had close links throughout the Troubles with the National Front and Combat 18. A group called the White Nationalist Party have leafleted several areas with ethnic minorities and the British National Party recently said it would field several candidates in the next council elections. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr James Uhomoibhi, a lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University who moved to the province from Nigeria 17 years ago, believes that ethnic groups have become &ldquo;more noticeable&rdquo; since the 1998 agreement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The issue of sectarianism has been largely removed and there are some who realise there are more ethnic people here. Racism existed before but it&rsquo;s just that the violence of the Troubles has gone away. People need to be educated to learn to accept that because someone is a different colour it does not make them a threat.&rdquo;
