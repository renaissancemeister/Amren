				<a href="http://www.nas.org/forum.html"><b> Diversity and the &ldquo;Fichtner Principle&rdquo;</b></a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>KC Johnson, National Association of Scholars Online Forum, Jan. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the wisest people I have encountered in the academy, Paula Fichtner, retired professor and former chair of History at Brooklyn College, once relayed to me a compelling analysis of faculty hires. First-class departments, she argued, hired first-class candidates, because talented professors wanted colleagues of scholarly quality. Second-class departments, on the other hand, make third-class hires, because mediocre professors want an environment that does not contain colleagues whose performance reminds them of their mediocrity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I was reminded of the Fichtner Principle when reading a recent <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> article regarding a program for &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; cluster hiring at the University of Arizona. A campus &ldquo;diversity committee&rdquo; has proposed &ldquo;recruiting not just one or even two diverse faculty members as isolated &lsquo;targets of opportunity,&rsquo; but rather a critical mass of diverse professors who have shared intellectual interests.&rdquo; &ldquo;Diversity,&rdquo; therefore, becomes little more than a mask to ensure ideological conformity among the new faculty. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The plan is part of a <a href="http://66.102.7.104/u/arizona?q=cache:aAaZCAPWn0oJ:info-center.ccit.arizona.edu/~vprovacf/diversity/blueprint.pdf+trower&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">broader emphasis</a> on diversity in hiring at the U of A, one that envisions a university in which &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; rather than academic quality becomes the primary motive for hiring, promotion, and tenure. According to the diversity plan of the campus, in faculty personnel matters, &ldquo;In order to make significant progress in creating a more diverse faculty and a campus that truly embraces diversity, the advancement of diversity must be established as a <em>primary indicator</em> of quality.&rdquo; Until diversity, the report concludes, &ldquo;is included in the institutional family of primary indicators of quality, other indicators will continue to trump it &mdash; especially in the hiring of new faculty.&rdquo; The U of A contends that &ldquo;this does not mean lessening our commitment to excellence in research and teaching,&rdquo; but such a claim is absurd: research and teaching, according to the &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; plan, will have to meet an ideological litmus test before being judged on their quality. Indeed, the plan argues, &ldquo;Depending upon the discipline,&rdquo; new faculty should be required to &ldquo;conduct research and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the importance of valuing diversity.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The U of A is one of two major universities (Virginia Tech is the other) that has committed itself to implementing the diversity theories of Harvard Education School researcher Cathy Trower. In a <a href="http://216.239.39.104/search?q=cache:wkfhqt4NDLgJ:www.nasulgc.org/AM2002/presentations/AM2002_Trower_Rmrks.pdf+%22cathy+trower%22&amp;hl=en&amp;start=35&amp;ie=UTF-8">talk</a> at Chicago summarizing her findings, Trower listed a variety of subtle developments in the academy that she contends undercut efforts at diversity, including the &ldquo;single-minded devotion to professional pursuits&rdquo; and excessive value placed on research. &ldquo;To compound the problem,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;some members of the majority, for reasons of self-interest or self-defined notions of &lsquo;quality,&rsquo; are reluctant to grant newcomers a toehold.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the Trower/U of A worldview, traditional academic conceptions of quality &mdash; peer-reviewed publication, lecture-and-discussion style teaching &mdash; is a negative. Colleges instead should stress fidelity to a particular ideological agenda in their hiring processes. In another <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/trower.htm">recent address</a> given by Trower, which I attended at Brooklyn College, she offered the following assertions: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> &ldquo;even if we don&rsquo;t think we are biased, there&rsquo;s a good chance that we are&rdquo;; </li>
				<li> academic culture emphasizes values &ldquo;congenial to a white, middle-class orientation&rdquo;; </li>
				<li> women &ldquo;are normed against males and trapped by sex-role stereotypes where masculine traits are favored over feminine&rdquo;; </li>
				<li> an &ldquo;accumulated disadvantage&rdquo; for faculty of color is that they find that their teaching and scholarship don&rsquo;t meet the requirements for tenure; </li>
				<li> &ldquo;merit is socially constructed by a dominant coalition&rdquo;; </li>
				<li> &ldquo;improvement of society as well as advancement of knowledge&rdquo; is necessary for excellence in research; </li>
				<li> colleges should &ldquo;require job candidates to demonstrate a commitment to furthering diversity on campus&rdquo;; </li>
				<li> among the &ldquo;excuses&rdquo; for colleges not enacting diversity agendas in hiring, arguments of affirmative action opponents; opponents of affirmative action will ignore all evidence contrary to their beliefs and just gather all evidence to support their view; </li>
				<li> opponents of her ideas content with &ldquo;20th century university&rdquo;; need &ldquo;21st century university.&rdquo; </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				There are a couple of ways to approach the Trower analysis. The first, of course, is that it envisions a radically different type of university, one based on the promotion of a specific ideological agenda, and designed to train a generation of social activists rather than teach students knowledge from traditional academic disciplines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is also, however, another way to approach the Trower agenda: it is little more than an updated version of the Fichtner Principle. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that no prestigious research university has adopted this approach to hiring. For mediocre scholars, however, it must be awfully tempting to pretend that the assault on quality is not a case of second-class departments making third-class hires, but instead a commitment to &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; as if, somehow, Trower is correct that the only way to produce a &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; faculty is to abandon a commitment to quality scholarship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Public money is funding this ideologically driven application of the Fichtner Principle. It makes me wonder whether Arizona state legislators, when they appropriate funds for the U of A, intend that the university should &ldquo;require job candidates to demonstrate a commitment to furthering diversity on campus&rdquo; or believe that &ldquo;merit is socially constructed by a dominant coalition.&rdquo; If not, perhaps they should start asking questions of U of A administrators as to exactly what type of education Arizona students will receive from this new generation of &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; faculty.
