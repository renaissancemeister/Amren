				<a href="https://www.washtimes.com/metro/20040120-121444-4316r.htm">Warner Decries Dishonoring of Lee</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Christina Bellantoni, The Washington Times, Jan. 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Vandals desecrated statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson over the weekend and Gov. Mark Warner denounced the vandalism yesterday as &ldquo;hatemongering.&rdquo; Richmond police, however, declined to classify the incident as a hate crime. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The statue of Lee, which stands with other Confederate heroes on Richmond&rsquo;s Monument Avenue, was spray-painted early Saturday morning with &ldquo;Death to Nazis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Happy birthday, MLK.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Vandalism is a crime,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;The message spray-painted on the statue was certainly hatemongering. A cowardly act like that is not at all what Dr. King advocated.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The governor attended a Roman Catholic Mass yesterday commemorating Martin Luther King, the slain civil rights leader. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities have elevated the spray-painting incident to felony vandalism under a code protecting monuments and could investigate it as a hate crime, said Maj. Mike Jones, assistant chief of the Virginia Capitol Police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Lee statue is owned by the state and protected by the Capitol Police. The statue of Jackson was splattered with green paint. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Maj. Jones said the vandals would have required only 30 to 45 seconds at the Lee statue to cause the damage, estimated at more than $1,000, making the crime a felony. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said police have some leads but are encouraging anyone with information to call 804/786-4357. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Crimes like this are traditionally done in darkness, usually by a coward not willing to stand up for what they are doing,&rdquo; Maj. Jones said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The vandalism was cleaned before the holiday events yesterday. The leaders of a Civil War heritage group urged authorities to prosecute the vandalism as a hate crime and said that members have volunteered to guard the monuments next year during the Lee-Jackson holiday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is definitely a hate crime,&rdquo; said Brag Bowling, commander of the Virginia division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Mr. Bowling wants cameras installed to guard the frequently vandalized statues on Monument Avenue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These monuments are the city&rsquo;s biggest tourist attraction,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The police are being way too casual on this.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bowling said members of his group will guard the monuments at night and may hire a private security firm. The group offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Maryland and Virginia Sons of Union Veterans urged the governor to issue a proclamation for a Civil War History Month, a Confederate History Month or a Union Soldier Month, but he declined to do so. The groups urged Mr. Warner to pay attention to the historical significance of the war. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before 2000, Virginia had a combined holiday for Lee, Jackson and King. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state now observes the federal holiday of the third Monday in January to honor King and the preceding Friday as Lee-Jackson Day. Yesterday was Lee&rsquo;s 197th birthday, which is commemorated as a holiday in most Southern states. He was born in 1807 in Westmoreland County and has traditionally been regarded, along with George Washington, as Virginia&rsquo;s favorite son.
