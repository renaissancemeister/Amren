			<h1>
				<b>Report From Occupied America: Hasta La Vista, Freedom Of Speech!</b> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>D.A. King, VDare.com, Jan. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				[<i>Most recently by D.A. King: Vox Pop On Amnesty In Georgia</i>] 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, January 12, in an effort to make citizens aware of an anti-amnesty protest rally at the Georgia State Capitol organized by my <a href="https://www.theamericanresistance.com/index.html">The American Resistance Foundation</a>, I went to several local newspapers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At one,<a href="https://www.ledgernews.com/"> <i>The Cherokee Ledger-News</i></a> (&ldquo;The Voice of Cherokee County&rdquo;) the editor, James Budd, [<a href="mailto:editor@ledgernews.com"><i>email</i></a><i> him</i>] told me that my notice could not be run as news, or on the community bulletin board, as I do not live in Cherokee County, and the event was not being held in Cherokee county. (The county line is 3 miles from my home.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Budd suggested that I pay to have it run as an advertisement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So &mdash; I tried that. And faxed the below: 
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.theamericanresistance.com/index.html"><b>THE AMERICAN RESISTANCE FOUNDATION </b></a> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b><i>IT IS NOT UN-AMERICAN TO ENFORCE THE LAW!</i></b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>PROTEST RALLY!</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>GEORGIA CAPITOL BUILDING!</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>10:00 AM - 2:00 PM</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>FEB 5 2004!</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b><i>No amnesty for illegal aliens! No drivers licenses for illegal aliens!</i></b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>We protest our law being ignored. We protest the ongoing enabling and assistance of illegal aliens. We protest our unsecured borders!</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>No other cause or agenda will be welcomed.</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>ASSISTING AN ILLEGAL ALIEN IS A FEDERAL CRIME!</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS IN OUR COUNTRY </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>AND HOW WILL WE STOP THEM THEN?</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two days later, the advertising manager today sent me an e-mail thanking me for my interest in advertising&hellip;and informing me that <b>&ldquo;after careful consideration&rdquo;</b> they had <b>&ldquo;&hellip;decided that this type of information is </b><b>not appropriate</b><b> for our community newspaper.&rdquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				In <i>the United States of America</i>, my information is &ldquo;<b><i>inappropriate</i></b>&rdquo;! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I fully support and have actively defended the <i>Cherokee Ledger-News</i>&rsquo; right to decide what advertisements go into their paper. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But I have the right to be offended by their decision. I am today more in fear for my nation&rsquo;s future than I was yesterday. Obviously, the politically-correct pressure that has scared these well-intentioned neighbors of mine into this absurd conclusion has been more effective than I realized. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is something that happens in New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco. Right? 
			</p>
			<p>
				I fear that I am seeing the creation of <b>&ldquo;Georgiafornia&rdquo;</b><b>.</b> [Sorry, <a href="https://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-a=000a298a-sp00000000&amp;sp-q=mexifornia+Hanson&amp;sp-p=all">Mr. Hanson.</a>] 
			</p>
			<p>
				As owner/publisher Dave Caughman [<a href="mailto:davec@ledgernews.com"><i>email</i></a><i> him</i>] was apparently traveling, I spoke to a very courteous and apologetic office manager, Diane Witt [<a href="mailto:diannew@ledgernews.com"><i>email</i></a><i> her</i>]. Ms. Witt assured me that she was <b>&ldquo;not trying to offend&rdquo;</b> me. She <b>&ldquo;agreed that our laws should be tightened&rdquo;</b>&hellip;but because the community that they served contained <b>&ldquo;</b><b>a lot of Hispanics</b>,<b>&rdquo;</b> they were unwilling to accept my ad business, as the flyer <b>&ldquo;might offend someone.&rdquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				My ad contains no reference to <b>&ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo;</b> &mdash; only the law, and those who violate it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She went on to explain that her paper had many advertisers who may be offended by their running this 2 x 4 inch notice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These potentially-offended groups, according to Ms. Witt, included Habitat for Humanity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have in hand a week-old edition of the <i>Cherokee Ledger-News</i>; I do not see an advertisement from Habitat for Humanity. I do see a disclaimer that reads: <i>The views on the Editorial and Opinions pages are not necessarily the views of THE CHEROKEE LEDGER-NEWS</i>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Apparently enforcing the law is too delicate a subject to be given this same consideration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the <i>Ledger-News </i>is not afraid of controversy! In a four-inch wide, page-high slot above this notice was a section headed &ldquo;Cherokee Voice.&rdquo; In it the responses of six local residents are presented answering a question asking if they favor a pending local city ordinance that would ban indoor smoking. (It is unanimous; all six are in favor.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				I can only guess at the turmoil that must have been created for the staff in finding the courage to present this potentially offensive question. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In our 5-minute conversation, I learned that it is Ms. Witt&rsquo;s position that this effort to avoid offending <b>&ldquo;Hispanics and </b><b>groups that are trying to help them</b><b>&rdquo;</b>only means that she and the staff were <b><i>&ldquo;not trying to pass judgment&hellip;&rdquo;</i></b> When I observed that it is my opinion that she will need to <b>&ldquo;pick a side soon&rdquo;</b> between giving offense to criminals and having a nation to pass on to her children that bears at least some resemblance to the one we grew up in, she could only reply that she was <b>&ldquo;sorry that I feel that way.&rdquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				I am not sorry that I feel that way. And <i>I</i> am offended Ms. Witt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When informed that I was taking notes and was going to write an account of the entire episode, Ms. Witt replied that this represented a <b>&ldquo;threat&rdquo;</b> and that I <b>&ldquo;should be darn careful what I say.&rdquo;</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have been darn careful, Ms. Witt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More careful, concerned, and thoughtful in what I say than you and your staff have been in considering the consequence of trading the rule of law for some self-conferred sense of goodness and political correctness. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More darn careful than to abandon my country and my principles to lawless invaders, and to those who enable them &mdash; even if they are readers or advertisers or traitors to the freedom of the press.
