				Annan Pleads for EU to Keep its Doors Open to Immigrants
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>EU Business, Jan. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				UN chief Kofi Annan on Thursday delivered a powerful plea for the European Union to keep its doors open to immigrants, both for its own benefit and for that of the world&rsquo;s poor and oppressed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a speech to the European Parliament accepting the assembly&rsquo;s annual Sakharov human rights prize on behalf of the UN, Annan highlighted the fears of some critics who argue that an insular EU is erecting a &ldquo;Fortress Europe&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the speech was not warmly welcomed by all EU lawmakers, with some conservative MEPs notably refusing to join in a prolonged standing ovation given to Annan at the end. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UN secretary-general delivered a blunt message that an ageing Europe needs immigrants, and needs to continue to welcome refugees, now more than ever. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The message is clear. Migrants need Europe. But Europe also needs migrants,&rdquo; he said to ringing applause which the minority of conservatives refused to join in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A closed Europe would be a meaner, poorer, weaker, older Europe. An open Europe will be a fairer, richer, stronger, younger Europe &mdash; provided you manage migration well,&rdquo; he added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Annan noted that the populations of EU member states are getting smaller and older as birth rates decline and people live longer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Without immigration, he said, the population of the soon-to-be 25 member states of the EU &mdash; 452 million &mdash; would drop to under 400 million people by 2050. Austria, Germany, Greece and Italy risk seeing their populations drop by around a quarter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Were this to happen, jobs would go unfilled and services undelivered. Your economies would shrink and societies could stagnate,&rdquo; Annan said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is no simple solution to this problem. But immigration is inevitably an important part of the solution.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UN chief also addressed head-on anxiety in Europe about growing numbers of refugees, an issue that the EU has been trying for years to tackle by negotiating a common policy on asylum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People migrate today for the same reasons that tens of millions of Europeans once left your shores &mdash; they flee war or oppression, or they leave in search of a better life in a new land,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Migrants are part of the solution, not part of the problem. They should not be made the scapegoats for a vast array of social ills.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The EU&rsquo;s increasingly restrictive immigration policies have also drawn criticism from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which has taken issue with a new law on family reunification. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The European Parliament has taken member states to court over the law passed last February, which among other conditions requires immigrants&rsquo; children to sit a test to prove their knowledge of Europe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asked at a press conference about the frosty reception his speech drew from some MEPs, Annan said: &ldquo;I did not see the comments from the members as rejecting my views as such.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said he shared the view that promoting development in poorer countries was crucial &ldquo;so they (migrants) can make a decent life in their own country and so don&rsquo;t feel the need to move on&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For his part, European Parliament president Pat Cox said the overwhelming majority of MEPs had given Annan &ldquo;the warmest of welcomes&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You cannot please all of the people all of the time,&rdquo; he added.
