				<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/1/13/172143.shtml">Jailed Terror Suspect Helped ACLU Draft Schools&rsquo; Anti-Christian Rules</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Wes Vernon, NewsMax.com, Wednesday, January 14, 2004 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?sort=Score&amp;format=Long&amp;config=&amp;restrict=&amp;exclude=&amp;method=and&amp;words=Alamoudi">Abdurahman Alamoudi</a>, an alleged senior terrorist operative, is behind bars on an 18-count indictment. But he can take satisfaction in the fact that a court in California has just given the green light to schools following ACLU&rsquo;s religion-in-the-classroom guidelines, which he helped to formulate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A federal judge judge has now upheld the constitutionality of an intensive three-week <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/showinside.shtml?a=2002/1/10/171525">course in California government schools</a> that requires children to choose a Muslim name, wear Islamic garb, memorize verses from the Koraan, pray to Allah, play &ldquo;jihad games, and simulate worship activities related to the Five Pillars of Islam.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The next step: likely an appeal to the <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?words=9th+Circuit+Court+of+Appeals&amp;x=97&amp;y=15">notoriously left-wing 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, which <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/6/26/144040.shtml">deems the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But hasn&rsquo;t American Civil Liberties Union lectured us that religious instruction in school violates what it describes as &ldquo;separation of church and state&rdquo; (a phrase that appears nowhere in the U.S. Constitution)? Read on. That injunction seems to depend on which religion is involved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The guidelines in ACLU&rsquo;s document is in effect a warning (some would say an implied threat) to schools as to how they can avoid legal challenges from the same ACLU on church/state issues in the classroom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alamoudi, founder and former executive director of American Muslim Council, was jailed last fall on charges that include taking money believed to come from a charity Libya has used to support terror, taking $340,000 in cash with the intent to bring it to Syria from London. It is also believed some of the money was to be taken to Saudi Arabia (or Saudi accounts) and from there to organizations of influence the United States. The charges include money-laundering, misuse of a passport and failure to report bank accounts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				J. Michael Waller, Annenberg Professor of International Communications at the Institute of World Politics, believes Alamoudi&rsquo;s arrest &ldquo;may have ripped the lid off an international support network in Washington that operated to finance terrorists inside the United States and abroad,&rdquo; according to Insight magazine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Clintonoid Terrorist Connection</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alamoudi&rsquo;s name will ring a bell with some NewsMax readers. In 2000, we identified him as a &ldquo;friend and sometime adviser on Islamic affairs to Hillary Rodham Clinton,&rdquo; and reported that he had stood before a crowd in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House &ldquo;and passionately declared his support for the terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbolah.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				NewsMax also quoted Alamoudi, a Clinton administration appointee, as a &ldquo;goodwill ambassador&rdquo; to Muslim countries. We cited his comment to a pro-Palestinian organization in Chicago in 1997, years before 9/11: &ldquo;I think if we are outside this country, we can say oh, Allah, destroy America, but once we are here, our mission in this country is to change it. There is no way for Muslims to be violent in America, no way. We have other means to do it [destroy America].&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some outraged parents, particularly in California, believe one of the &ldquo;other means&rdquo; Alamoudi might have had in mind was indoctrinating American children in school, an issue back on the front burner with this week&rsquo;s decision by U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alamoudi, a naturalized American, proclaims he is innocent of any terrorist links or activities. In a letter to the Washington Post for Dec. 12, 2003, he blames an inaccurate translation of an Arabic interview he gave in 1999 for the implication that he supports terrorism. He said the charge ignored a preceding sentence &ldquo;in which I clearly and unequivocally denounced terrorist violence.&rdquo; He added he had been &ldquo;criticized by many of my associates for believing that violence is never justified by any religion.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				ACLU has confirmed to NewsMax that Alamoudi in fact represented American Muslim Council among the organizations that helped craft the ACLU document &ldquo;Religion In The Public Schools: A Joint Statement of Current Law.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many government schools have given great weight to the document as a warning. Anyone who follows the news knows ACLU aggressively looks for opportunities to run to court and sue anyone or any institution that shows the slightest trace of promoting Christianity in the public square. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, many of them have bended over so far backward to show &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and avoid costly nuisance lawsuits that they have prompted outrage from parents who believe school authorities have crossed the line from tolerance to indoctrination in Islam. NewsMax will have more on that in upcoming articles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The parents&rsquo; outrage led to the lawsuit by Christian students, now dismissed by Judge Hamilton. The jurist did not find the prayer and worship to be &ldquo;devotional activities.&rdquo; We will address the double standard inherent in the judge&rsquo;s ruling in our next installment in this series. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy and a severe critic of radical Islam&rsquo;s attempted influence in both major political parties in the United States, reiterated to NewsMax.com that among Muslims &ldquo;the vast majority do not subscribe to &lsquo;Islamist&rsquo; radical, intolerant, often violent jihadist tendencies&rdquo; of those who want to kill Americans.
