			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Bill Sammon, The Washington Times, Jan. 16, 2004</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				President Bush&rsquo;s immigration initiative has angered conservative Republicans so much that some are refusing to donate to his re-election campaign, according to a Bush fund-raiser in Georgia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Phil Kent, a member of the host committee for a Bush fund-raiser in Atlanta yesterday, said he was told by several would-be donors that they would not attend the $2,000-per-person event because of the president&rsquo;s announcement last week on immigration reform. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I was soliciting checks right after the announcement, and I lost two checks from people who had wanted to come, but wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Kent said. &ldquo;They specifically said this is just rewarding lawbreakers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That was the constant theme,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And even among some people who wrote the checks, there&rsquo;s grumbling.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Bush&rsquo;s initiative would allow millions of illegal aliens to remain in the United States as guest workers if they have jobs. The immigrants eventually could apply for permanent legal residence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The vast majority of Georgians &mdash; black and white, I might add &mdash; don&rsquo;t like this because it&rsquo;s perceived as amnesty for illegal immigrants,&rdquo; Mr. Kent said, shortly before greeting the president at the fund-raiser. &ldquo;And I intend to tell him so, not just because it doesn&rsquo;t help him with money, but because it&rsquo;s wrongheaded policy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asked what he specifically would tell the president, Mr. Kent said: &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a great president, but, boy, I think you&rsquo;re wrong on amnesty for illegals.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Bush campaign official declined to criticize Mr. Kent, but said of his complaint: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s that big a deal.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Fundamentally, this is a tough decision the president made to address a tough issue,&rdquo; the official said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a decision based on policy concerns, not political concerns.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Interviews with attendees at last night&rsquo;s fund-raisers revealed a mix of opinions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gerry Lynn Warner, who works for an Atlanta assisted-living equipment company, said although he opposed the immigration initiative, he was even more opposed to the idea of supporting a Democratic candidate, such as former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. So, Mr. Warner donated the $2,000 to the president. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with everything he does, and I think it would be a mistake to do what he has proposed,&rdquo; Mr. Warner said. &ldquo;In business, you have to support the guy you think is going to win.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jim V. Schrull of Horton Automotive, who also gave $2,000 to the campaign, said the president&rsquo;s proposal was not a factor in his decision to contribute. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased with the proposal. I actually think it&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; Mr. Schrull said. Opponents of the plan, he said, &ldquo;are either misinformed or uninformed.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But those opponents include Rep. Johnny Isakson, Georgia Republican, who is considered the front-runner in the campaign to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Zell Miller. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have great respect for President Bush and the leadership he has provided over the last four years,&rdquo; Mr. Isakson said in a statement. &ldquo;I have serious concerns, however, over recent policy announcements with regard to undocumented workers and illegal aliens.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the president&rsquo;s proposal would cause an increase in illegal immigration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We must not reward past illegal activity or encourage it in the future,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do believe a complete overhaul of our nation&rsquo;s immigration system is critical. Any reform must begin with strict enforcement of current laws and better security at our borders.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Also opposing the immigration initiative are the three Republicans who are vying to fill Mr. Isakson&rsquo;s seat in Georgia&rsquo;s 6th Congressional District, which once was held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ironically, much of the grumbling from Republicans came during a fund-raiser at which Mr. Bush was introduced by a Democrat &mdash; Mr. Miller. The senator, who is retiring at the end of the year, called the president &ldquo;a great leader with a good heart and a spine of steel.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The more I see of this leader, my respect and my support just continue to grow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I can guarantee you that I will not be the only Democrat working for his re-election.&rdquo;
