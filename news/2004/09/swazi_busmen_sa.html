<h1><a href="https://capeargus.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=2240078">Swazi Busmen Say Rape Apt Punishment For Miniskirt</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, Cape Argus (Cape Town, SA)</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bus conductors in Swaziland have vowed to assault and rape female passengers who wear mini-skirts, sparking outrage among women&rsquo;s groups in the conservative African kingdom.</p>
<p>The threat followed this week&rsquo;s arrest of two conductors and a bus driver who were charged with indecently assaulting an 18-year-old high school pupil.</p>
<p>The pupil was attacked at a bus rank in Manzini, Swaziland&rsquo;s commercial centre, by a group of men who shouted at her for wearing a miniskirt, cut it off and then gang-raped her, witnesses told local media.</p>
<p>About 1 000 women marched on the bus rank on Thursday to protest against the attack. </p>
<p>They were met by bus crews carrying signs reading: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them with our brushes&rdquo; &mdash; a reference to the reported use of a brush handle in the rape.</p>
<p>A bus conductor calling himself only Licandza said: &ldquo;Women who wear miniskirts want to be raped, and we will give them what they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bus drivers banned miniskirts on buses earlier in the year, saying they were distracting and encouraged lustful thoughts.</p>
<p>Although there have been incidents of women having their clothes ripped off at the bus rank, this was the first reported case of rape. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is madness. This has no place in modern society,&rdquo; said Nomhlanhla Dlamini, director of a local NGO, the Swaziland Action Group Against Abuse.</p>
<p>Dlamini said three women had since come forward to her group to report being raped at the bus rank earlier this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are talking to the bus owners. We want them to make a code of conduct. We are urging the Road Transportation Board to revoke the operating licences of the involved buses,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>The kingdom does not have a state transport system and relies on privately owned minibus taxis to fill the gap.</p>
<p>Police who were criticised by the pupil&rsquo;s grandmother for being slow to arrive on the scene, said they would be vigilant in case of a repeat of the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has a right to harass anyone because of what the person is wearing,&rdquo; Superintendent Vusie Masuku said.</p>
<p>Swazi women generally wear modern Western clothing and have worn mini-skirts since the 1960s although the government at one stage considered banning them on moral grounds.</p>
<p>Some tribal chiefs, however, do ban women wearing miniskirts in their areas.</p>
<p>The governor of the royal village Ludzidzini, the most powerful traditional figure in the kingdom, has stopped women from wearing trousers in the village and at the royal palaces.</p>
<p>Speakers at the protest said the attack was symptomatic of a society that discriminated against women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a connection between customs that say we cannot own property or be parties to legal contracts, and bus conductors who want to dominate us by telling us what to wear,&rdquo; said one speaker.</p>
<p>The government said it condemned the crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the young woman was subjected to could be tantamount to murder, as the health status of the perpetrators is not known,&rdquo; Prime Minister Themba Dlamini said.</p>
<p>Swaziland is ruled by sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s last absolute monarch and has one of the highest rates of HIV/Aids in the world.</p>
