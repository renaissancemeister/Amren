<h1>Players Threatened To Decapitate And Rape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dag Langerød and Carin Pettersson, Nettavisen, Sept 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The audience got more than they bargained for when they attended Sunday&rsquo;s game between Djerv 2 and Hetlevik at Askøy outside Bergen. </p>
<p>Several of the Djerv 2 players acted aggressively towards both other players and the audience. According to the local paper Bergensavisen, one person was injured after being knocked to the ground by a Djerv player. </p>
<p>Violent threats</p>
<p>The sudden outburst of rage was also directed against several audience members, several received death threats and several were threatened with decapitation. Some of the women in the audience were threatened with rape. </p>
<p>The police had to be called to calm people down. </p>
<p>Neither the players nor the leaders want to comment the incident, but it has been reported to the police. </p>
<p>Section leader Roald Bruun-Hanssen said to the paper that it is not the first time this year that Djerv 2 has been in the media because of negative behavior. Earlier this year, a keeper from the team attacked a referee. He was later refused to play soccer for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>Unheard of</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are threats of aggravated violence and we don&rsquo;t want anything like this on the soccer filed,&rdquo; Bruun-Hanssen said to TV 2 Nettavisen. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t either heard to anything like this before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he does not want to condemn the entire team which mainly consist of immigrants. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the people on the team are there to get a positive experience and to play soccer,&rdquo; Bruun-Hanssen said. &ldquo;Now Djerv has to present its view of the case, and then we have to evaluate possible sanctions against players and the club afterwards. But at the same time as it is important to send a clear message, we are also forced to try to aid Djerv as a club so that they can incorporate persons with multicultural background into the club in the most sensible way.&rdquo;</p>
