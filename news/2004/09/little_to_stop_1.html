			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Bellantoni, Washington Times, Sep. 24</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. citizens who go to the polls Nov. 2 to decide local, state and national elections are likely to get more help from noncitizens this year than ever before.</p>
<p>Beyond requiring applicants to sign a pledge on voter-registration forms affirming that they are U.S. citizens, there is no way to prevent the nation&rsquo;s estimated 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens from casting ballots in November, area elections officials said. </p>
<p>Locally, only Virginia requires voters to provide their Social Security numbers, but the state does not require voters to show their Social Security cards. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no way of checking,&rdquo; said Maryland State Board of Elections Administrator Linda H. Lamone. &ldquo;We have no way of doing that. We have no access to any information about who is in the United States legally or otherwise.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Nationally, immigration experts said it is likely that illegal immigrants vote, but that only a small percentage does so. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence suggests very few illegal aliens vote, but it&rsquo;s certainly not zero,&rdquo; said Steven Camarota, director of research at the D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies. &ldquo;Illegal aliens don&rsquo;t come to America to vote, and would generally try to avoid doing so.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Today, there are roughly 8 million illegal aliens in the United States who are of voting age, he said. </p>
<p>Mr. Camarota said more legal immigrants who are not citizens might be voting illegally. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole system isn&rsquo;t well-guarded,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no system in place to really prevent illegal aliens from voting or even to deter them from voting.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Six Maryland municipalities &mdash; Chevy Chase, Takoma Park, Garrett Park, Barnesville, Martin&rsquo;s Additions and Somerset &mdash; allow noncitizens to vote only in local elections. However, in state and national elections, voters must meet the state standards for voter registration. </p>
<p>Given the predicted close election this year and the 2000 election that was decided by a small number of votes, Mr. Camarota said even the few aliens who do vote could make a difference in the results. </p>
<p>Only first-time voters are required to provide photo identification in Virginia and the District. No jurisdiction requires voters to show proof of citizenship at the polls. </p>
<p>No federal agency keeps records of which undocumented immigrants are in the country, Mrs. Lamone said. </p>
<p>Maryland does ensure, through an extensive process of cross-database checks and balances, that there are no deceased persons or felons on its voter rolls. </p>
<p>Barbara Cockrell, assistant secretary of the Virginia State Board of Elections, said the state has a computerized voter-registration system that uses Social Security numbers as unique identifiers. The state constitution requires that voters provide their numbers, which she said are kept private. </p>
<p>Miss Cockrell said asking on the registration forms whether applicants are citizens provides the needed safeguards. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They take an oath under penalty of perjury,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After the first time, we don&rsquo;t ask them to bring ID.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Bill O&rsquo;Field, a spokesman for the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics, said the penalty for lying on the voter-registration form is a maximum five-year prison sentence or a $10,000 fine. </p>
<p>Other than for first-time voters who registered by mail, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no checking of ID,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Dan Stein, president of the D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, said relaxed voting regulations and the ability to register to vote through the Department of Motor Vehicles allows illegal immigrants to get a form of legitimate identification. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There are huge fraud problems out there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no safeguards on it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He also said those groups pushing voter-registration efforts this year don&rsquo;t check to see if registrants are citizens. This flaw has the potential to &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; the political system, he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Aliens have already shown they are willing to break U.S. law to come here. Why should we expect them to not vote?&rdquo; Mr. Stein asked. &ldquo;In a system where virtually no effort is made to ensure integrity, we&rsquo;d be naive to say it isn&rsquo;t going on. You only need one vote to swing an election.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Peter Rubin, professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center, said many groups are &ldquo;interested in suppressing the votes of minorities and using illegal tactics as a way of scaring people from coming out to the polls.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That has happened in many elections,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These tactics are real, continue to be used, and are underreported. It should be of concern to everyone, especially now, when everyone&rsquo;s vote matters.&rdquo; </p>
