<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3690668.stm">Swiss Reject Citizenship Reform</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Sep. 27</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swiss voters have turned down plans to relax the country&rsquo;s strict citizenship laws, referendum results show. </p>
<p>A proposal to ease naturalisation for foreigners brought up and educated in the country was defeated after 56.8% of voters opposed it. </p>
<p>A separate proposal to grant automatic citizenship to the grandchildren of immigrants failed narrowly, with 51.6% voting against. </p>
<p>Being born in the country will continue to be no guarantee of citizenship. </p>
<p>Identity crisis </p>
<p>The government had said it wanted to make procedures easier, saying too many people were left out of the country&rsquo;s system of direct democracy. </p>
<p>But right-wing parties launched a bitter campaign against the proposals, claiming they would undermine Swiss identity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a sad day for Switzerland,&rdquo; said Claudio Micheloni, head of a migrants&rsquo; integration association told the Associated Press. </p>
<p>Switzerland&rsquo;s regional voting patterns were divided along linguistic lines, with western French-language cantons accepting the proposals and eastern German-language Alpine cantons voting against. </p>
<p>The only Italian-speaking canton, Ticino, also voted no. </p>
<p>Job restrictions </p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Imogen Foulkes in Berne says becoming Swiss is a long, complicated and expensive process. </p>
<p>The decision is made locally: village communities approve or reject citizenship applications. </p>
<p>That fits into the Swiss system of direct democracy, where the people have the last word on every political decision, she says, but the system is also open to abuse. </p>
<p>Of a population of only seven million, Switzerland now has 1.5 million foreigners. </p>
<p>Most were born in the country or are long-term residents. But they cannot vote and are barred from certain jobs, such as the police. </p>
<p>In several Swiss communities, applications from candidates with a Yugoslav or African background are regularly rejected, even if they satisfy all the legal requirements.</p>
