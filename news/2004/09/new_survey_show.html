<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SACRAMENTO &mdash; California voters strongly support a proposed ballot initiative to limit government benefits to illegal aliens according to a new survey released by the Save Our License Committee.</p>
<p>More than 60% of those polled expressed support for the proposed measure, with only 32% opposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This demonstrates clearly that our legislature is out of touch with average Californians,&rdquo; noted Mike Spence, President of the California Republican Assembly, and one of the proponents of the initiative. &ldquo;When our elected officials pass bills to give driver&rsquo;s licenses and in-state college tuition breaks to people here illegally, they are clearly going against public sentiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by Probolsky Research also found solid voter support for a provision in the ballot measure which would hold elected and government officials personally liable for willfully violating this law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This initiative is about putting power back into the hands of average Californians,&rdquo; added Assemblyman Mark Wyland, Chairman of the Save Our License Initiative. &ldquo;The legislature has failed us, and it is time for California voters to be given the chance to decide this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governor Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s potential opposition to the proposed ballot measure would have little negative impact, the survey found. &ldquo;In fact the largest percentage of voters say the governor&rsquo;s position on the issue makes no difference to them,&rdquo; reported pollster Adam Probolsky.</p>
<p>The proposed initiative would specifically prohibit government from granting any tax-funded benefits not mandated by federal law to illegal immigrants. In addition, it would require the state to defend the law against any court challenges, and would hold government officials personally liable for violations of the law.</p>
<p>Proponents have until February to gather 600,000 valid signatures.</p>
<p>The survey of registered California voters who are likely to vote was conducted Wednesday September 22 through Monday September 27, 2004. A total of 830 voters were polled. A survey of this size yields a margin of error of +/-3.5%. The survey was conducted in English and Spanish.</p>
