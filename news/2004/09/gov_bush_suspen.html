<h1>Gov. Bush Suspends Miami Commissioner Arthur Teele Jr.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Sept. 22</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MIAMI &mdash; A city commissioner accused of trying to run an unmarked police car off the road was suspended Wednesday by Gov. Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>Arthur Teele Jr., 58, was suspended indefinitely without pay in a proclamation issued by Bush&rsquo;s communications office.</p>
<p>Teele was arrested Aug. 26 on charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle and threatening a public official, both felonies. He was elected city commissioner in 1997, and was a Miami-Dade County commissioner before then.</p>
<p>The commissioner was under investigation and surveillance for allegations that he &ldquo;received hundreds of thousands of dollars in return for the performance of his public duties,&rdquo; according to an arrest warrant. Police said the probe stemmed from his role as head of the city&rsquo;s Community Redevelopment Agency.</p>
<p>According to police, detectives pulled Teele over Tuesday and he reacted &ldquo;in an apparent rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teele threatened a detective, saying he was &ldquo;an armed man and that he would shoot&rdquo; the detective if he continued to conduct surveillance of Teele&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Teele&rsquo;s attorney has said the commissioner was unsure of who was following his wife and himself, and he was doing what any angry private citizen would do.</p>
<p>Bush routinely suspends elections officials who are charged with felonies. <br>
