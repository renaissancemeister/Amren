			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, Yahoo! News, Sep. 6</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>EXETER, England (Reuters) &mdash; Anthropologists stepped into a hornets&rsquo; nest on Monday, revealing research that suggests the original inhabitants of America may in fact have come from what is now known as Australia. </p>
<p>The claim will be extremely unwelcome to today&rsquo;s native Americans who came overland from Siberia and say they were there first. </p>
<p>But Silvia Gonzalez from John Moores University in Liverpool said skeletal evidence pointed strongly to this unpalatable truth and hinted that recovered DNA would corroborate it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very contentious,&rdquo; Gonzalez, a Mexican, said with a smile at the annual meeting of the British association for the Advancement of Science. &ldquo;They (native Americans) cannot claim to have been the first people there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She said there was very strong evidence that the first migration came from Australia via Japan and Polynesia and down the Pacific Coast of America. </p>
<p>Skulls of a people with distinctively long and narrow heads discovered in Mexico and California predated by several thousand years the more rounded features of the skulls of native Americans. </p>
<p>One particularly well preserved skull of a long-face woman had been carbon dated to 12,700 years ago, whereas the oldest accurately dated native American skull was only about 9,000 years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have extracted her DNA. It is going to be a bomb,&rdquo; she said, declining to give details but adding that the tests carried out so far were being replicated to make sure they were accurate.</p>
<p>She said there were tales from Spanish missionaries of an isolated coastal community of long-face people in Baja California of a completely different race and rituals from other communities in America at the time. </p>
<p>These last survivors were wiped out by diseases imported by the Spanish conquerors, Gonzalez said. </p>
<p>The research is one of 11 different projects in America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East being funded over a four-year period by Britain&rsquo;s Natural Environment Research Council. </p>
<p>The projects, focusing on diet, dating and dispersal of people down the millennia in the face of climate change, aim to rewrite anthropology. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make headlines from heads,&rdquo; said Professor Clive Gamble of Southampton university. &ldquo;DNA will give us a completely new map of the world and how we peopled it.&rdquo;</p>
