			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>C.T. Revere, Tucson Citizen, Sep. 8</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva expected to face a Republican opponent he could take on with a platform of national issues such as the economy and the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>What he got is an opponent he doesn&rsquo;t even plan to engage in his bid for a second term in Congress. </p>
<p>When perennial candidate Joe Sweeney scored a lopsided victory over political newcomer Lou Muñoz in the Republican primary for Congressional District 7, he presented Grijalva with a challenge he&rsquo;d rather just sidestep. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to give him a forum for his diatribes, which are inherently racist, inherently anti-immigrant, inherently anti-women, inherently anti-gay,&rdquo; Grijalva said. &ldquo;We thought about it and we&rsquo;re not going to give him an audience. We&rsquo;re going to ignore him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sweeney said his goal is to &ldquo;represent the citizen taxpayers&rdquo; and not a narrow group of people he believes Grijalva represents. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in Chicanos or Hispanics. I&rsquo;m not going to represent illegal immigrants. I&rsquo;m not into the gay community. I&rsquo;m going to represent 80 percent of the people, not 20 percent of the people,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Grijalva argues that Sweeney&rsquo;s ideology represents a &ldquo;fringe element&rdquo; of the Republican Party. </p>
<p>Muñoz agrees. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Sweeney doesn&rsquo;t represent the Republican Party,&rdquo; Muñoz said, still stunned from his 40-percentage-point loss. </p>
<p>U.S. Congressional District 7 Republicans </p>
<p>Joe Sweeney	10,970,	70.4%<br>
Lou Muñoz	4,602,	29.6%</p>
<p><div class="title>GOP Duo Vying For Tilt With Grijalva</div></p>
<p><em>C.J. Karamargin, Arizona Daily Star, Aug. 13</em></p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s 7th congressional district was practically created for Rep. Raúl Grijalva. </p>
<p>It is predominantly Hispanic, solidly Democratic and has one of the state&rsquo;s highest concentration of blue-collar workers. </p>
<p>Given this, you might think Republicans wouldn&rsquo;t even bother trying to wrest the sprawling district from Grijalva&rsquo;s grip. </p>
<p>Think again. The seat is being eyed by two Republicans: Lou Muñoz and Joe Sweeney. They square off in the Sept. 7 GOP primary, and the winner goes up against Grijalva in November. </p>
<p>In Muñoz and Sweeney, voters have a clear choice. Muñoz is a fresh face on the local political scene. He is a first-time candidate who entered the race because he believes his views aren&rsquo;t being represented in Congress. </p>
<p>Sweeney is an old hand at the political game. Over the last 20 years he has run for Congress a dozen times &mdash; as a Republican, Democrat and a member of the New Alliance Party. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the only way to change the system,&rdquo; he said of his many trips down the campaign trail. </p>
<p>As in 2002, Sweeney&rsquo;s top issue this year is border and immigration policy &mdash; or as he puts it, the lack of one. Illegal immigration looms so large for Sweeney, in fact, that he considers it the root of many of society&rsquo;s ills. Ask him about health care, unemployment or mandatory jail sentences, and he will inevitably commandeer the conversation back to illegal immigration. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s abomination what&rsquo;s happening with these people coming into our country,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Sweeney is dead-set against the guest-worker plan introduced last year by Sen. John McCain, Rep. Jim Kolbe of Tucson and Rep. Jeff Flake of Mesa. In his view, allowing foreign workers into the country legally would do little to address the nation&rsquo;s border woes. </p>
<p>The thousands of immigrants who enter the country illegally every year &ldquo;pose a serious homeland-security risk,&rdquo; Sweeney said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re organized in different gangs, they can terrorize our own citizens into submission.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The tip of Sweeney&rsquo;s spear this year is voter fraud, which he believes is caused by the unchecked registration of countless illegal immigrants. If elected, he would call for a federal investigation into the matter. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a farce,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t vote in Mexico. They shouldn&rsquo;t vote here.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In addition to stricter enforcement of the border, Sweeney wants the government to do a better job of keeping tabs of who is in the country. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have some kind of national ID system to identify who our citizens are,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Immigration and border policy is also a concern for Muñoz. He believes a guest-worker program could work and said it &ldquo;is something we have to look into.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My understanding is the &lsquo;bracero&rsquo; program of years past was successful in its time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If a guest-worker program is established, we must ensure that there is accountability and workers enter the country legally.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Muñoz calls himself a &ldquo;fiscal conservative and a socially conscientious Republican.&rdquo; As a small businessman, he said he is sensitive to government actions that could hurt the business community, such as raising the minimum wage. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Raising the minimum wage would be inflationary, it would cost jobs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People on fixed incomes would suffer the most.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He said President Bush&rsquo;s tax cuts helped businesses and also helped reduce unemployment. </p>
<p>On same-sex marriage, Muñoz calls himself a traditionalist. &ldquo;I believe marriage should be between a man and woman,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>While he would support a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages, Muñoz said he supports civil unions, but that should be up to individual states to decide. </p>
<p>Muñoz, who traveled to Phoenix on Wednesday to hear Bush make his pitch for a second term, said he is a strong supporter of the administration&rsquo;s approach to the Middle East. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The region has been a hotbed of violence for many years. By assisting in establishing strong democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan, we should be able to help in making the world a safer place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hopefully, people in other countries, in the region will see the benefits of a democracy and move in that direction.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Asked if the cost &mdash; in lives and money &mdash; to remove Saddam Hussein was worth it, Muñoz said that the loss of even one American life was &ldquo;too many&rdquo; but the benefits are clear. </p>
<p>&ldquo;By removing Saddam Hussein, we have eliminated an evil dictator and brought some stability to the region,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken to military personnel who have served in the region and they feel strongly that their efforts were worth it. They assure me the Iraqi people, as a whole, want us there. They also feel they have a job to do and they are resolved to getting it done. The ones I have spoken to overwhelmingly support President Bush and the war effort.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Muñoz said he is a strong supporter of the military and considers military spending a major government responsibility. &ldquo;We must fund the military to ensure they have the equipment necessary to maintain their needs and safety,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>With 26 days until the primary, Muñoz said his time and energy are focused less on November than on that first electoral hurdle. But should he win the party&rsquo;s endorsement, Muñoz said he plans to counter whatever advantages Grijalva might have by running an issues-oriented campaign. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I would hope the Hispanic community is more conservative than Grijalva,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Grijalva, a former Pima County supervisor, does not have a primary opponent. </p>
