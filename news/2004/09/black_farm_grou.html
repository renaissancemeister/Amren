<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WICHITA, Kan. &mdash; The nation&rsquo;s various black farm groups formed a coalition Tuesday to pursue claims that the government discriminates against them in loans and farm programs. </p>
<p>The new group, the Congress of Black Farmer Organizations, contends the Agriculture Department has continued discriminatory practices and failed to live up to a sweeping civil rights case settled five years ago. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something that is certainly overdue,&rdquo; said John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers Association. &ldquo;We need to work together on this issue. This is an issue the government has been able to keep us divided for a number of years.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Besides Boyd&rsquo;s group, the new coalition includes the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives and the Arkansas Land Development Fund. The groups met in Atlanta on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The move comes less than two weeks after the filing of a new class-action lawsuit, and just as the House Judiciary Committee prepares to hear testimony on the alleged failure of the earlier consent decree. </p>
<p>A report last month by the Environmental Working Group and the National Black Farmers Association said a large majority of the 96,000 black farmers who sought restitution under the 1999 settlement were rejected. </p>
<p>The USDA has steadfastly contended its record on civil rights laws has been exemplary during President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration. It cited numerous initiatives it has undertaken to give black farmers a greater voice in the agency&rsquo;s organizational structure and its efforts to funnel more business to minority farmers. </p>
<p>Thousands of black farmers are expected to gather in Washington on Sept. 28 for a rally and to attend the House Judiciary Committee&rsquo;s special meeting, said Thomas Burrell, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturalist Association. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Discrimination is real and it tears apart families,&rdquo; Boyd said. &ldquo;When you lose your farm you aren&rsquo;t losing just your job, you lose everything &mdash; ou lose your family, you lose your heritage, you lose your history and you lose the way you make a living.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Together the coalition groups represent as many as 100,000 black farmers, Burrell said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have individual (groups) represent different points of view. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t support the same issues,&rdquo; Burrell said. <br/>
