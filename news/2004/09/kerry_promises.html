<h1>Kerry Promises Immediate Immigration Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vida en el Valle, Pacific News Service, Sep. 1</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>FRESNO, Calif. &mdash; Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry capped a recent farm workers convention by promising to propose &ldquo;comprehensive immigration reform&rdquo; within his first 100 days in office if he defeats President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Kerry made the promise in a seven-minute telephone call to delegates last Saturday at the 17th Constitutional Convention of the United Farm Workers in Fresno, California.</p>
<p>He also vowed to immediately sign the bipartisan AgJobs bill, which would allow undocumented farm workers to gain legal residency status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within hours of being sworn in, there will be health care for all Americans,&rdquo; said Kerry. &ldquo;Every child in America will be covered by child care. In addition to that, we will be introducing an opportunity for kids to graduate from high school differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>UFW President Arturo S. Rodriguez, who introduced Kerry as &ldquo;the next president of the United States,&rdquo; said that the union will be &ldquo;with you every step of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kerry&rsquo;s remarks were the highlights of the opening day of the two-day convention, which was held at the Fresno Convention Center New Exhibit Hall.</p>
<p>About 400 delegates were joined by about 400 other supporters at the convention, which is putting the spotlight on the AgJobs bill and a couple of farm worker-friendly bills that were passed in the wee hours Saturday in Sacramento.</p>
<p>Other highlights included retirement gifts for State Sen. Pro Tem John L. Burton, the senate speaker who walked out a different man from the convention after receiving &mdash; and putting on &mdash; a red guayabera, a traditional Mexican shirt, and a black UFW jacket. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be leaving the struggle, or the fight for farm worker justice,&rdquo; said Burton, who was praised for shepherding a bill two years ago that allows the UFW to go to binding arbitration on deadlocked contract talks. &ldquo;I will be fighting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burton is retiring at the end of this year from his post because of term limits.</p>
<p>AFL-CIO President John Sweeney lambasted the Bush administration for a loss in jobs and Americans covered by health insurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure turned his back on the American people,&rdquo; said Sweeney during prepared remarks at the convention. &ldquo;He promised us 5 million jobs and he&rsquo;s off 7 million because he&rsquo;s lost 2 million jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, addressing the audience in Spanish, warned of a &ldquo;new anti-immigrant wave.&rdquo; He also backed SB 60, the driver&rsquo;s license bill authored by state Sen. Gil Cedillo and passed at 3 a.m. Saturday. The governor has threatened to veto the bill because the licenses for undocumented residents would not have an identifying mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t sign it, he&rsquo;ll have to explain why not,&rdquo; said Nunez, who said the governor assured lawmakers he would sign a driver&rsquo;s license bill if it included criminal background checks.</p>
