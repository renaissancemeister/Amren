<h1><a href="https://www.fairus.org/Media/Media.cfm?ID=2496&amp;c=34">How Many NY Voters are Illegally Registered</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Federation for American Immigration Reform, Aug. 31</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In light of recent revelations that New York Department of Motor Vehicles has issued as many as 250,000 driver&rsquo;s licenses to individuals who provided Social Security numbers that do not match information in the Social Security Administration&rsquo;s database, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is calling upon the state&rsquo;s Board of Elections to conduct a county by county review of voter rolls. Under the Motor Voter law, it is reasonable to &ldquo;assume that large numbers of individuals have also been unlawfully registered to vote,&rdquo; state FAIR in a formal demand letter to Board of Elections Chair Carole Berman. </p>
<p>&ldquo;After the 2000 voting fiasco in Florida, that included allegations of fraudulent voting in addition to the infamous hanging chads, it is vital that every state take precautions to prevent a repeat of the situation,&rdquo; cautioned Dan Stein, executive director of FAIR. &ldquo;If the DMV found a quarter of a million improperly issued driver&rsquo;s licenses &mdash; nearly the equivalent of the population of Buffalo &mdash; there is a very strong possibility that large numbers of people are also improperly registered to vote, and may be in a position to decide a very tight election.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is believed that a large percentage of the 250,000 individuals whose driver&rsquo;s license applications included erroneous Social Security information are illegal aliens. Because many people register to vote at the time they apply for a driver&rsquo;s license, it must be assumed by county registrars that a significant number of illegal aliens have also been added to voter rolls. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We learned four years ago that when the integrity of the voter registration process is compromised, the outcome of elections &mdash; including the presidency of the United States &mdash; can be compromised,&rdquo; said Stein. &ldquo;In the post-9/11 era, allowing people to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses, voter registration cards and other state-issued ID is also a threat to security. It is a lesson that New Yorkers know better than anyone. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The names and addresses of the 250,000 people identified by the DMV are right there on their licenses. It should not be a major undertaking to cross reference those names against county voter rolls,&rdquo; Stein continued. &ldquo;What we are asking is that the Board of Elections live up to what is stated in its charter, which includes &lsquo;the preservation of citizen confidence in the democratic process and enhancement in voter participation in elections.&rsquo; Making sure that illegal aliens are not casting votes in New York would seem to fit that description of the Board&rsquo;s responsibility.&rdquo; A copy of the letter can be obtained from FAIR.</p>
