<h1><a href="http://www.officer.com/article/article.jsp?id=16798&amp;siteSection=5">Philadelphia Police Captain Sues Over Discrimination</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) &mdash; A police captain testified Tuesday that he suffered retaliation for complaining about a sergeant who brought in a &ldquo;bull&rsquo;s-eye&rdquo; poster of Osama bin Laden seven days after the Sept. 11 attacks. </p>
<p>Khalid Mohammed Syed, 49, was the first witness on the first day of trial of his civil-rights suit against the city. </p>
<p>A native of Pakistan and a U.S. citizen since 1981, Syed joined the Philadelphia police department in 1990. He said the poster incident made him &ldquo;scared for my life&rdquo; and &ldquo;terrified&rdquo; his wife and two young children. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I just could not believe that someone would have brought that poster in at a time like that,&rdquo; Syed testified, &ldquo;at a time when hundreds of Muslims were being killed because people believed they were involved&rdquo; in the Sept. 11 attacks. </p>
<p>Within six months, Syed was accused by students in one of his police academy classes of making a derogatory comment about gays, joking about the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and suggesting some recruits try drugs to stay awake in class. </p>
<p>Syed denied the allegations, but a Police Board of Inquiry found against him. He was suspended without pay for 15 days and transferred to the night shift in a South Philadelphia police district. </p>
<p>After the Sept. 11 attacks, Syed was &ldquo;singled out because he looked the part.  &hellip;  The nation was in turmoil, and individuals such as himself who look different were feeling that turmoil,&rdquo; said Jamie C. Ray, Syed&rsquo;s attorney. </p>
<p>Deputy City Solicitor Laura K. Teresinski told the jury that Syed&rsquo;s discipline was for not cooperating with the investigation of the cadets&rsquo; complaints and was typical for an academy instructor.</p>
