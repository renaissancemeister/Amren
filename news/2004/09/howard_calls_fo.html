<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3678788.stm">Howard Calls For Immigrant Quotas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Sept. 22</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michael Howard has said his party will crack down hard on illegal immigration. </p>
<p>The Conservative leader called for MPs to agree an annual quota on the number of immigrants entering Britain. </p>
<p>Mr Howard said the Tories would also reinstate a system of checks on people leaving the UK and pull out of the &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; 1951 UN refugee convention. </p>
<p>But Home Office Minister Hazel Blears said Mr Howard&rsquo;s strategy was too inflexible to work. The Refugee Council said it would &ldquo;put lives at risk&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Mr Howard acknowledged asylum and immigration were difficult areas for any politician to tackle, predicting his speech would be written off by some as a &ldquo;lurch to the right&rdquo;. </p>
<p>But, he said, immigration and asylum were a cause for concern across the world and right across Britain. </p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s immigration and asylum system had broken down and voters were aware it was &ldquo;chaotic, unfair and out of control&rdquo;, he said. </p>
<p>Immigration limit </p>
<p>The former home secretary said his decision to lift checks for passengers leaving the UK for the EU was a mistake which had been compounded by New Labour&rsquo;s decision to scrap all embarkation controls in March 1998. </p>
<p>On the UN convention he said it should be replaced with British legislation as the 1951 document has ceased to be effective. </p>
<p>The convention obliges nations to give shelter to people with a well-founded fear of persecution and forbids returning asylum seekers to countries where they might face further harm. </p>
<p>The UN High Commission for Refugees&rsquo; Peter Kessler said it was &ldquo;preposterous&rdquo; to suggest opting out of the convention would &ldquo;lessen the number of asylum seekers and refugees fleeing their countries&rdquo;. </p>
<p>But Mr Howard insisted: &ldquo;Genuine refugees will be welcomed, but those who are not will be swiftly removed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Under Tory proposals, the annual immigration limit would be approved by Parliament. </p>
<p>Proper controls? </p>
<p>Mr Howard said: &ldquo;Over the years hundreds of immigrant communities have successfully integrated into British society. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They have rightly held on to their traditions and culture, while also embracing Britain&rsquo;s and playing their full role in our national life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But any system of immigration must be properly controlled.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Howard, himself the son of an immigrant, said that the limit on immigration should be determined by &ldquo;Britain&rsquo;s economic needs, demands of family reunion and our moral obligation to give refuge to those fleeing persecution&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Home Office figures for 2003 revealed 139,675 people were granted the right to stay in the UK that year. </p>
<p>Reduced claims? </p>
<p>Of those, 66,000 were allowed in to join their families, 29,000 were permitted to stay after working in Britain and 21,000 were asylum cases. </p>
<p>Ms Blears asked what would happen if the quota was filled and somebody facing torture or needed for a hospital job wanted to enter Britain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Tories using asylum and immigration in a nakedly political way, it is appalling,&rdquo; she told BBC News 24. </p>
<p>Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten MP said: &ldquo;Michael Howard&rsquo;s approach is all about limiting not welcoming. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Liberal Democrats will make the positive case on immigration by setting quotas linked to the economic case. Mr Howard wants quotas as a way of capping immigration.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&lsquo;Utterly shocked&rsquo; </p>
<p>UK Independence Party MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said Mr Howard had &ldquo;plagiarised&rdquo; a speech he made earlier in September advocating quotas, a point system and pulling out of the 1951 convention. </p>
<p>The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said that it was &ldquo;utterly shocked that the Conservative Party seems prepared to ditch Britain&rsquo;s long-standing humanitarian commitment to the Geneva Convention&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Maeve Sherlock, said the Conservatives&rsquo; strategy failed to contribute to the asylum debate in a constructive way. </p>
<p>&ldquo;These proposals quite clearly will not offer refugees a safe haven in the UK,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We need separate systems for refugees and for people coming here to work. </p>
<p>&ldquo;An arbitrary limit on all immigration, including refugees, would put lives at risk and would damage our economy.&rdquo;</p>
