<h1><a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/09/05/wosse705.xml">Cleric Supports Targeting Children</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rajeev Syal, Telegraph (UK), Sep. 5</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An extremist Islamic cleric based in Britain said yesterday that he would support hostage-taking at British schools if carried out by terrorists with a just cause.</p>
<p>Omar Bakri Mohammed, the spiritual leader of the extremist sect al-Muhajiroun, said that holding women and children hostage would be a reasonable course of action for a Muslim who has suffered under British rule.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Mohammed said: &ldquo;If an Iraqi Muslim carried out an attack like that in Britain, it would be justified because Britain has carried out acts of terrorism in Iraq.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as the Iraqi did not deliberately kill women and children, and they were killed in the crossfire, that would be okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Mohammed, 44, who lives in Edmonton, north London, but is originally from Syria, also claimed that the Chechen rebels were not responsible for the deaths of more than 350 people &mdash; at least half of them children &mdash; who are so far known to have died in Beslan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mujahideen [Chechen rebels] would not have wanted to kill those people, because it is strictly forbidden as a Muslim to deliberately kill women and children. It is the fault of the Russians,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The father of seven came to Britain in 1985 after being deported from Saudi Arabia because of his membership of a banned group. He has since been given leave by the Home Office to remain in Britain for five years but the Government is reviewing his status.</p>
<p>He gave an interview yesterday to promote a &ldquo;celebratory&rdquo; conference in London next Saturday to commemorate the third anniversary of the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>Andrew Dismore, the Labour MP for Hendon, was infuriated by Mr Mohammed&rsquo;s comments. &ldquo;That sounds to me like incitement and I will report him to Scotland Yard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is an insult to most moderate Muslims, who are sick of people like this claiming to represent them.&rdquo;</p>
