<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BENTON COUNTY &mdash; Prosecutors now think the killing of a popular high school football coach was gang related. </p>
<p>Two teens were arrested Wednesday in connection with the murder of Bob Mars in Benton City. His body was found Sunday at Kiona-Benton Middle School where he was a teacher. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have released pictures of the teen they say killed Mars. They are asking that both Robert A. Suarez, 16, and Jordan E. Castillo, 14, be tried as adults. </p>
<p>Suarez is charged with 1st degree murder, Castillo is charged with 1st degree aggravated murder. They&rsquo;ll both be in court Friday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is probable cause to believe that Mr. Castillo committed the murder to advance his standing in a gang,&rdquo; said Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Castillo did have tattooing on the web of his hand the very next day after the homicide. That tattoo is consistent with the gang he was being initiated into,&rdquo; explained Benton County Sheriff Larry Taylor. </p>
<p>Suarez is believed to have recruited Castillo and convinced him to kill. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence indicates that Mr. Castillo is the one who actually did the stabbing, whereas Mr. Suarez was an accomplice to the robbery,&rdquo; said Miller. &ldquo;Under the felony murder rule he is still guilty of murder in the 1st degree.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mars&rsquo; truck was found in the school parking lot on Sunday. A vehicle window had been broken and the truck appeared to have been ransacked, according to court papers. Missing were an envelope containing about $300 in cash and the coach&rsquo;s cell phone. </p>
<p>As for Coach Mars, the Sheriff and Prosecutors both say the killing was planned but the victim was random.</p>
