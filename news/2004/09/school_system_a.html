<h1>School System &lsquo;Is Failing Black Boys&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Cassidy, Independent (UK), Sep. 12</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ofsted, the school inspectorate, has started to judge schools as failing because their teachers are not promoting racial equality, the head of Britain&rsquo;s anti-racist watchdog claimed yesterday.</p>
<p>Trevor Phillips, head of the Commission for Racial Equality, told a London conference on the under-achievement of black children that new anti-racist guidelines developed by the CRE and Ofsted had exposed several schools which were not doing enough to tackle inequality.</p>
<p>He was joined on the platform by the former black soccer star turned TV presenter Garth Crooks, who condemned &ldquo;gangsta&rdquo; culture for promoting an &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; of black-on-black violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To youngsters in our community who think they are gangsters and want to contaminate our youngsters, our message has to be &lsquo;grow up you are pathetic&rsquo;. You will not get away with muggings, shootings and murders because you are not gangsters or clever, you are kids,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to impose zero tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is widespread concern about the poor performance of Afro-Caribbean pupils, particularly boys. Only around a fifth of black boys achieve five good GCSE passes, compared to a national average of 51 per cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several schools have been warned by Ofsted that their performance is not up to scratch in racial equality. I understand that some schools have actually been failed because of this,&rdquo; said Mr Phillips.</p>
<p>He described the underachievement of black boys at secondary school as a crisis.</p>
<p>He told the conference, London Schools and The Black Child, that there were twice as many young black men in jail as at university. </p>
