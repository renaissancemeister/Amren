<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3677570.stm">Uganda&rsquo;s HIV Success Questioned</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Ross, BBC News, Sept. 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Uganda is often held up as a success story and the government lauded for the progress it has made with the official prevalence rate put at only 6%. </p>
<p>But after conducting research in districts across Uganda, an NGO suggests the real picture is far worse. </p>
<p>They found prevalence rates as high as 30% and bad access to anti-retrovirals. </p>
<p>Major Rubaramira Ruranga, the executive director of the National Guidance and Empowerment Network of people living with HIV/Aids in Uganda (NGEN), said he believed the HIV prevalence rate could be more than three times higher than previously thought. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We have found the prevalence rate at this time is 17%,&rdquo; he told a news conference. </p>
<p>Research </p>
<p>The organisation has been carrying out research in several districts across the country and claims in the western area Rukungiri the prevalence rate is 30%, while in Busia near the Kenyan border it is 20% and in the northern district of Apac it is 18%. </p>
<p>Major Ruranga, who says he has been living with HIV for the past 21 years, says his organisation has networks of people living with HIV/Aids right across the country and he used these networks to find out how many people are HIV positive in each village. </p>
<p>Although singing different tunes, it is perhaps a sign of good cooperation that also present at the same news conference was Doctor Elizabeth Namagala of the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s Aids control programme. </p>
<p>She said there are areas in the country where the rates are higher than the national average, but stressed that the ministry&rsquo;s research was more scientific but welcomed the NGEN research as &ldquo;useful data&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Raffle </p>
<p>The major also expressed shock at the lack of access to life-saving anti-retroviral drugs in Uganda. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going for a raffle?&rdquo; he asked. </p>
<p>The ministry of health says 120,000 Ugandans currently need anti-retroviral drugs out of which 25,000 are currently accessing them &mdash; so there is a huge shortfall. </p>
<p>Around 3,000 people are currently getting them free of charge. </p>
<p>The prices are due to drop further but at around $25 a month the drugs are still out of reach for most. </p>
<p>Doctor Peter Mugenyi, the chair of Uganda&rsquo;s task force on Aids, doubts the new figures are as accurate as the official statistics but welcomes them if they cause people to take more precautions. </p>
<p>However controversial Major Ruranga&rsquo;s findings may be, the concerns he is expressing could well do some good. </p>
<p>Despite President Yoweri Museveni&rsquo;s many awards for his role in the fight against HIV/Aids, the disease remains a huge problem so complacency would be disastrous.</p>
