<h1><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/news/election/topstories/articles/0925prop200debate.html">MVD Bust Labeled &lsquo;Gift&rsquo; For Prop. 200</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robbie Sherwood, Arizona Republic, Sep. 25</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A leading supporter of Proposition 200, the immigration measure facing voters, on Friday called a sting at the state Motor Vehicle Division &ldquo;a gift from God&rdquo; for the campaign.</p>
<p>Twenty-six current and former state workers and eight others were indicted this week on charges that they illegally sold driver&rsquo;s licenses to, among others, federal agents posing as undocumented immigrants. </p>
<p>Randy Pullen, chairman of Yes on 200, said the bust proves the measure is needed to help prevent undocumented immigrants from fraudulently applying for state services.</p>
<p>Pullen and former Attorney General Grant Woods debated the initiative at a breakfast for Valley Partnership, a non-profit business-development organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, God, that we have a huge problem with fraud in our motor vehicles department,&rdquo; Pullen told Valley Partnership members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anybody does not believe today that we have problems with fraud in this state with regards to issues like this, and with voting and welfare, let me tell you, &lsquo;God didn&rsquo;t make little green apples, and it don&rsquo;t rain in Indianapolis in the summertime,&rsquo; because it is a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proposition 200, known as Protect Arizona Now, would make criminals of state and local government employees who fail to check the immigration status of anyone applying for non-federally mandated state services. It also would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and an ID when voting in person.</p>
<p>Woods, chairman of Arizonans for Real Immigration Reform, said that the MVD bust showed that the system works and exposes &ldquo;the fallacies&rdquo; of Proposition 200.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of things to thank God for, but I didn&rsquo;t know that one of them was we should thank God for fraud at the MVD,&rdquo; Woods said.</p>
<p>Even supporters agree that the measure does nothing to stop illegal immigration and laws against providing welfare and other services to undocumented immigrants are already on the books.</p>
<p>Woods told the group that the measure was &ldquo;poorly written&rdquo; because it does not define &ldquo;public benefits.&rdquo; Also, it could lead to higher government costs and government intrusion on citizens who may have to produce birth certificates or passports for services as minor as getting a library card.</p>
<p>Woods said the entire Arizona congressional delegation, the governor, mayors and business groups with diverging ideological interests all oppose Proposition 200.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you think of anything else that all of these people agree upon? I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Woods said.</p>
<p>Pullen said, &ldquo;the real business community,&rdquo; meaning small-business owners, supports the measure, evidenced by recent polls which indicate that eight Republicans to one support the measure as do three Democrats to one.</p>
<p>Pullen also noted that eight of the 19 Sept. 11 terrorists were in the country illegally but registered to vote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t think we have a problem with illegal voting in this state or others, then you just don&rsquo;t understand the problem,&rdquo; Pullen said.</p>
<p>Woods said voter fraud is rare because terrorists and undocumented immigrants are not entering the country to vote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get our own people to vote in elections, much less get someone else to come here and vote,&rdquo; Woods said, before making a joke about recent conservative triumphs in recent legislative primaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, if they are voting, they&rsquo;re voting very conservatively,&rdquo; he added.</p>
