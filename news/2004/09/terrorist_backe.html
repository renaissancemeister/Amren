<h1><a href="/search/index-ssf_/base/columns-0/1095139105150430.xml">Terrorist Backers In; Common Sense Out</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NJ.com, Sep. 14</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I was driving along the other day listening to the radio when on came an announcement from the New Jersey Domestic Preparedness Task Force. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrorists will attack again in America,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;You should be ready &mdash; where you live, where you work and where you travel.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I should. But every time I hear this sort of thing, I ask myself a basic question: How can the terrorists attack us if we don&rsquo;t let them into the country? </p>
<p>As it happens, the 9/11 commission recently asked the same question. Last month the commission released a report titled &ldquo;9/11 and Terrorist Travel.&rdquo; It was a supplement to its main report. </p>
<p>The first words are: &ldquo;It is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks within the United States if they cannot enter the country.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obvious to me. And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s obvious to you. But it raises a question: Why don&rsquo;t we prevent potential terrorists from entering the country? </p>
<p>As it happens, I recently had an exchange with Rep. Barney Frank on that exact subject on these pages. I noted that in 1987 the Massachusetts Democrats sponsored a law that made it easier for people with questionable backgrounds to enter the United States. </p>
<p>In a letter to the editor, Frank responded, &ldquo;Mulshine asks what I was thinking when I &lsquo;sponsored a bill that precluded immigration officials from refusing entry to foreigners with admitted terrorist connections.&rsquo; The answer is nothing because I never sponsored any such legislation.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Frank went on to note, &ldquo;I did sponsor legislation  &hellip;  that ended the practice of excluding people from our country because we disagree with their political views.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Okay. Suppose a citizen of Saudi Arabia shows up for a visa interview wearing a T-shirt that says &ldquo;I love Osama.&rdquo; Should that person be refused a visa? </p>
<p>&ldquo;A T-shirt is not a terrorist connection,&rdquo; Frank said when I got him on the phone yesterday. &ldquo;If all you&rsquo;ve done was to wear T-shirt, I don&rsquo;t think you should be excluded.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just Frank&rsquo;s opinion. That&rsquo;s U.S. policy. Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration studies notes that American immigration officials are told that they can&rsquo;t even consider political opinions when issuing visas. Showing up for an immigration interview with an &ldquo;I love Osama&rdquo; T-shirt is perfectly acceptable, she said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never refuse somebody on those grounds,&rdquo; Vaughn told me. &ldquo;The person practically has to come in and say, &lsquo;Yeah, I was going to blow up whatever.&rsquo; And that might not be enough if they didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In his letter to me, Frank said of the bill he sponsored, &ldquo;Every one of the terrorists involved in Sept. 11 was completely excludable under this law.&rdquo; </p>
<p>True enough. But only if the terrorist in question had been nice enough to admit he was a terrorist. The commission report shows the visa application of hijacker Mohand al Shehri. Next to Shehri&rsquo;s scowling face are the words, &ldquo;Are you a member or a representative of a terrorist organization?&rdquo; Al Shehri checked the &ldquo;no&rdquo; box. That was enough to get him admitted to the country. This would be a comedy of errors if it weren&rsquo;t a tragedy. </p>
<p>Al Shehri and many of the other hijackers still could have been excluded on other grounds, such as incomplete information on their applications. But the immigration service was understaffed. Interviewers didn&rsquo;t have the time to review applications. The Bush administration is still refusing to give immigration officials the resources they need to police the borders, Frank said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t put enough money into it,&rdquo; said Frank of immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve put plenty of money into attacking Iraq, he noted, about $200 billion or so. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to be able to get them all over there,&rdquo; Frank said of the terrorists. </p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not. I rarely agree with Frank on anything, but I&rsquo;m with him on that point. It&rsquo;s insane to spend hundreds of billions remaking the map of the Mideast when we could shore up our borders for a fraction of that amount. If we&rsquo;re truly going to have a &ldquo;war on terror,&rdquo; we should close the borders to all nations that supply soldiers for the other side in that war. But it&rsquo;s not up to me. It&rsquo;s up to the Bush administration. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Even after 19 hijackers demonstrated the relative ease of gaining a U.S. visa and entering the United States, border security still is not considered a cornerstone of national security policy,&rdquo; the report states. </p>
<p>The report goes on to observe, &ldquo;It must be made one.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I agree with that. In the meantime, instead of running all those ads, I&rsquo;d suggest the homeland security people print a bunch of bumper stickers. How about &ldquo;Honk if you&rsquo;re a terrorist&rdquo;? That should root them out. </p>
