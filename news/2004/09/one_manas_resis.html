<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1302718,00.html">One Man&rsquo;s Resistance: &lsquo;Why I Turned Against America&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Burke, Guardian (London), Sep. 12</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Early one morning this week, when the police have yet to set up too many checkpoints, Abu Mujahed will strap a mortar underneath a car, drive to a friend&rsquo;s in central Baghdad and bury the weapon in his garden. In the evening he will return with the rest of his group, sleep for a few hours and then take the weapon from its hiding place. He will calculate the range using the American military&rsquo;s own maps and satellite pictures &mdash; bought in a bazaar &mdash; and fire a few rounds at a military base or the US Embassy or at the Iraqi Prime Minister&rsquo;s office. Then Abu Mujahed will shower, change and, by 10am, be at his desk in one of the major ministries. </p>
<p>Last week he sat in a Baghdad hotel speaking to The Observer. A chubby man in his thirties with a shaven head, a brown sports shirt, slacks and a belt with a cheap fake-branded buckle, he gave a chilling account of his life fighting &lsquo;the occupation&rsquo;. </p>
<p><strong>&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>[Mujahed&rsquo;s] group&rsquo;s first operation &mdash; in June last year &mdash; was an attempted ambush of three US soldiers in Adhamiya. It was a fiasco. &lsquo;We were so confused and scared we opened fire at random,&rsquo; Abu Mujahed said. &lsquo;They took cover and we ran away.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Their next try was more successful. The lead vehicle of an American military convoy ran over an anti-tank mine the group had laid in a road. &lsquo;We think we killed the driver,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We found the mine in a house that had been used by the military during the war. The Americans were not expecting that sort of device.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Over the next months the group varied the tactics. &lsquo;One day we try and snipe them, the next we use an IED [Improvised Explosive Device], the next a mine. We never get any orders from anybody. We are just told: &ldquo;Today you should do something,&rdquo; but it is up to us to decide what and when.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Black soldiers are a particular target. &lsquo;To have Negroes occupying us is a particular humiliation,&rsquo; Abu Mujahed said, echoing the profound racism prevalent in much of the Middle East. &lsquo;Sometimes we aborted a mission because there were no Negroes.&rsquo;</p>
