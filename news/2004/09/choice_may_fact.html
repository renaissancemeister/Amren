<h1>Choice May Factor Into Racial Segregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Williams, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, JS Online, Sep. 7</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Discriminatory lending, high-priced housing and other factors are often cited as reasons for racial segregation in Milwaukee and the suburbs.</p>
<p>But a new study is turning the spotlight on another phenomenon that the researchers say should not be overlooked: the tendency among some people to prefer living in segregated neighborhoods.</p>
<p>A study released Tuesday by the Public Policy Forum research group finds that although minorities face many roadblocks to equal housing opportunities, racial isolation often is a matter of individual preference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choice plays an important role in persistent boundaries of segregation,&rdquo; the study concludes, referring to the phenomenon as &ldquo;cultural affinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked to describe the racial makeup of their ideal setting, a neighborhood dominated by their own race was cited by 51% of blacks, 47% of whites and 18% of Hispanics. In each group, a small percentage said they would like to ban another race entirely.</p>
<p>Those affiliated with the study, which is based on interviews with 800 families, said a lack of funding prevented them from probing deeper into why home-buyers and other residents congregate with people of their own race.</p>
<p>A housing activist said the 32-page study raises an important point that could advance efforts to integrate southeastern Wisconsin, where minorities are concentrated in Milwaukee and the suburbs are overwhelmingly white.</p>
<p>William Tisdale, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council, said people often settle in segregated neighborhoods because they find a higher comfort level surrounded by their own race. As whites abandon a neighborhood or community, Tisdale said, minorities often decide that staying put is less stressful than confronting discrimination and other obstacles to equal opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re kind of stuck, so cultural affinity develops,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It just kind of happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others, however, are questioning the new study&rsquo;s findings.</p>
<p>Glen Lewinski, director of community development for Waukesha County, said a survey of 800 households does not seem to represent a reliable sample in a region of more than 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>Jeff Browne, executive director of the Public Policy Forum, said the sample was weighted to reflect the racial makeup of the four-county area. The size of the sample assures that the results should vary by no more than 3.5 percentage points for white respondents, but by as much as 9 percentage points for black respondents.</p>
<p>But the survey&rsquo;s results echoed past research in other cities, which have found that the majority of African-Americans would prefer to live in a neighborhood that is at least 50% black.</p>
<p>Value of study questioned</p>
<p>Waukesha County turned down a request from the Public Policy Forum to help fund the study.</p>
<p>Lewinski, who had not yet read the findings, said Waukesha County officials questioned whether the research would reveal anything new about housing segregation &mdash; an issue that Lewinski described as fairly simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can afford to live somewhere, you live there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the Public Policy Forum, the estimated $20,000 study was funded by Milwaukee County, M&I; Bank, the Greater Milwaukee Foundation, the Helen Bader Foundation, the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority and the Local Initiatives Support Corp.</p>
<p>Others that declined to participate included the City of Milwaukee and the Housing Authority of Racine County.</p>
<p>The Public Policy Forum, a non-profit group based in Milwaukee, originally hoped to raise $50,000.</p>
<p>Researchers spent two weeks in May and June conducting telephone interviews with 800 homeowners and renters in Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington counties.</p>
<p>As with past studies on the issue, Tuesday&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;Diversity, Choices and Housing,&rdquo; shows that blacks and Hispanics have more difficulty than whites getting home mortgages, obtaining government assistance and finding helpful real estate brokers.</p>
<p>Study: Whites treated better</p>
<p>The study showed that whites often get more favorable mortgage interest rates than minorities, with a typical $100,000 loan sometimes costing blacks as much as $58,000 more in interest payments and Hispanics as much as $19,000 more.</p>
<p>Browne said such trends represent significant obstacles to housing diversity that could be redressed through changes in public policies or banking industry practices.</p>
<p>But he said that while some people are forced to live in segregation by outside influences, others do so voluntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question that it&rsquo;s a complex issue,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Of those in the survey who said they would like to relocate, 50% of black respondents said they would prefer to live in Milwaukee, while 29% of Hispanics and 21% of whites said they would choose Milwaukee. The rest expressed preferences for various suburban areas.</p>
<p>How people decide where to live</p>
<p>Crime and housing costs were the biggest factors cited by most respondents in determining where they live, followed by schools, taxes and parks.</p>
<p>But the availability of public transportation was much more important in the location choices of minorities than for whites. Numerous studies have shown that African-Americans are less likely to own a car and more likely to depend on public transportation. This may make it more convenient for black people to rent or own a home in the city, Brown noted.</p>
<p>Leo Ries, director of the Local Initiatives Support Corp., an economic development group, said affinity toward one&rsquo;s own race &mdash; even when voluntary &mdash; is a detriment to multicultural tolerance and understanding.</p>
<p>Hoping the new study fosters discussion of the issue, Ries said he disagrees with those who believe segregation in southeastern Wisconsin has been studied enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been studied enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re at the point yet where people are prepared to do something about it.&rdquo;</p>
