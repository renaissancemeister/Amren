<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3669974.stm">German Far Right Makes Poll Gains</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Sept. 20</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Democratic Party (NPD) &mdash; which the government has tried to ban &mdash; surged to 9% in Saxony, well above the 5% needed to enter parliament there. </p>
<p>In neighbouring Brandenburg, the German People&rsquo;s Union (DVU) polled about 6%. </p>
<p>The results reflect anger at welfare cuts and disillusionment with persistently low living standards, says the BBC&rsquo;s Ray Furlong in Berlin. </p>
<p>The ex-communists of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) also did well in Brandenburg, but the mainstream parties still won in both states holding votes. </p>
<p>Voters in eastern Germany appear to have expressed their concern at the high unemployment they blame on Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder&rsquo;s Social Democrats. </p>
<p>Our correspondent says the results are being seen widely as a no-confidence vote in Mr Schroeder, who brought in the welfare cuts with the blessing of the conservative Christian Democrats. </p>
<p>Fifteen years after reunification, east Germans still receive lower wages, benefits, and pensions than compatriots in the west of the country, and almost one in five is out of work. </p>
<p>Breakthrough </p>
<p>In Dresden, the capital of Saxony, police clashed with demonstrators protesting against the far-right success. </p>
<p>The NPD&rsquo;s 9% in Saxony means that the party has gained seats in a German state assembly for the first time since 1968.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great day for Germans who still want to be Germans,&rdquo; said Holger Apfel, the NPD&rsquo;s leading candidate in Saxony. </p>
<p>Despite having their majority eroded, Germany&rsquo;s two mainstream parties remained ahead in both states, the early results suggested. </p>
<p>The ruling Social Democrats scored around 32% in Brandenburg, while the conservative Christian Democrats won 41% of the total vote in Saxony, the results showed. </p>
<p>Average unemployment in east Germany has been stuck at about 20% &mdash; nearly twice the national average. </p>
<p>Some six million people were eligible to vote in Sunday&rsquo;s elections in Saxony and Brandenburg. </p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s government has described the NPD as a latter-day version of Hitler&rsquo;s Nazi party and tried to ban it last year &mdash; a move rejected by the constitutional court. </p>
<p>The PDS scored their best election result ever, with 28% in Brandenburg. </p>
<p>However, they are unlikely to form a government in the state, which is ruled by a coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. </p>
