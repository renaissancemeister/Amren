<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3663292.stm">Mali&rsquo;s Human Sacrifice &mdash; Myth Or Reality?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sadio Kante, BBC News, Sept. 20</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Whenever major events such as initiation ceremonies or elections approach in Mali, some children, women and albinos start to become afraid. </p>
<p>Because this is when people &mdash; usually from these three groups &mdash; disappear. </p>
<p>If their bodies are found, they are rarely intact, as some of their organs have been cut out, to be used in human sacrifices, many people believe. </p>
<p>During May&rsquo;s local elections, the body of seven-year-old Souleymane Camara was found in a bag in a river several days after he had gone missing. </p>
<p>His genitals, heart and liver had been removed. </p>
<p>Many point the finger at politicians, businessmen or anyone seeking their fame and fortune, who believe that the powers of a magic charm will be boosted with a human ingredient. </p>
<p>Those responsible for these crimes are rarely brought to justice. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Witches&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mali is one of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and sociologist Assata Diallo says this provides the perfect conditions for conmen to flourish. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlatans, witchdoctors and other who live by selling dreams can easily attract people by saying they have the solutions to their problems,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The get-rich quick society and the difficulty of finding enough food for the whole family make the conmen very imaginative.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Belief in witchcraft is so widespread that there is even a monthly newspaper which specialises in such stories &mdash; Kabako. </p>
<p>State prosecutor Fodie Toure says that many healers, and witchdoctors, are coming to cities such as Bamako from the countryside in search of money and new clients. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are getting more cases of everything from people being killed for their organs, to graves being dug up and the bones being stolen, so they can be sold &mdash; either in Mali or exported,&rdquo; he says. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Straight to hell&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mali has strict laws against human sacrifice and anyone found guilty faces the death penalty. </p>
<p>But traditional healers operate openly, prescribing traditional plants or less harmful ways of bringing good luck and many Malians use them before consulting western doctors. </p>
<p>There is even a market for the ingredients used in magic charms in the heart of the capital, Bamako, between parliament and the main mosque. </p>
<p>Here, you can find all sorts of plants and wild animals, alive or dead. </p>
<p>Abdoul Dembele has several examples on display in his stall. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A lion&rsquo;s head makes you strong, while Arabs often buy hyena heads to become rich and if you know how to use them, cowry shells can bring lots of money,&rdquo; he says. </p>
<p>Malians use the healers for a variety of problems &mdash; to seek everything from cures for their ailments, to become rich, or find a husband or wife, or to bring success to their favourite football team. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Final step&rsquo; </p>
<p>When I met Abdramane Konate, he was reading cowry shells for a woman who wanted to know if her son would get a visa to go to France. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Any charlatan or healer who says he can solve someone&rsquo;s problems by spilling human blood will go straight to hell,&rdquo; he says. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Plants and natural herbs have all sorts of medicinal properties. Or if you want to be blessed by God, you can sacrifice a cow, a sheep, or a chicken. But never a human being,&rdquo; he says. </p>
<p>But one of Bamako&rsquo;s best known traditional healers, who wished to remain anonymous, says: &ldquo;Human sacrifice is a myth for intellectuals, but a reality for us in the business. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people who say they are devout Muslims or Christians are our best customers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Human sacrifice is the final step of a process, which only a few can achieve. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the colonial era, the real masters used to practise. Now, there are only trainee witches left.&rdquo; </p>
<p>When I went to ask Police Sergeant Sadio Coulibaly about the scale of the problem, the first thing he said was: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before you arrived, we had a young boy and a girl, who wanted us to arrest their parents, saying they were witches and wanted to eat them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We get those kind of cases every week but we rarely get any convictions because of a lack of evidence.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But Sergeant Coulibaly says he personally does not believe in witchcraft. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who kill and mutilate people are mentally disturbed. They need help.&rdquo;</p>
