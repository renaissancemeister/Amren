<h1>Rightwing People&rsquo;s Party Slammed By Rivals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Swissinfo, Sep. 24</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three of Switzerland&rsquo;s four main political parties have launched an unprecedented joint attack on the rightwing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party, ahead of Sunday&rsquo;s votes.</p>
<p>In full-page advertisements in Swiss newspapers, they denounced the party&rsquo;s descent into gutter politics.<br>
		<br>
Political observers say the move marks a further erosion of Switzerland&rsquo;s long-standing tradition of consensus politics.</p>
<p>Swiss politics has been in transition for several years, following the rise of the People&rsquo;s Party.</p>
<p>The shift to the right in last year&rsquo;s parliamentary elections led to the People&rsquo;s Party gaining an extra seat in the seven-strong cabinet, upsetting the so-called &ldquo;Magic Formula&rdquo; that had been at the root of Swiss politics since 1959.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several years now, political movements have been abusing freedom of expression,&rdquo; stated the advert, which was also signed by the presidents of two smaller parties.</p>
<p>Hatred</p>
<p>&ldquo;False associations, whimsical figures, unprincipled defamations and hateful advertisements spread a climate of fear and hatred that nothing can justify&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The signatories of this appeal are sometimes adversaries, but they all belong to parties that have built modern Switzerland since 1848, based on dialogue and mutual respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signatories called on the Swiss public to vote on Sunday in favour of two proposals &mdash; opposed by the People&rsquo;s Party &mdash; aimed at easing naturalisation restrictions.</p>
<p>The appeal follows the publication of highly controversial adverts opposing the moves by groups linked to the People&rsquo;s Party. </p>
<p>Muslims </p>
<p>One advertisement claimed that Muslims could make up the majority of the population by 2040, while another showed a Swiss identity card with a picture of the Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Another showed dark-skinned hands grabbing Swiss passports.</p>
<p>Emanuel von Erlach, a political researcher at Bern University&rsquo;s institute of political science, told swissinfo that the joint newspaper appeal marked a new development in Swiss politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not new in Switzerland for one of the major parties to try to position itself against the others for tactical reasons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s Party has been doing this for years, but it is not the only one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is new, though, is that the other parties have come together in this form, with the publication of a joint full-page advert.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Enough is enough </p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly what has changed is that the latest campaign by the People&rsquo;s Party has been particularly dirty, and many people right across the political spectrum have just had enough,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>However, von Erlach pointed out that there was a strong element of political manoeuvring on both sides.</p>
<p>The appeal was signed by the presidents of the three oldest members of Switzerland&rsquo;s power-sharing government, made up of the centre-left Social Democrats, the centre-right Christian Democrats and Radicals, and the People&rsquo;s Party.</p>
<p>The other two main signatories were the presidents of the Green Party and the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the People&rsquo;s Party dismissed the cross-party appeal as a late attempt to make up lost ground before Sunday&rsquo;s vote.</p>
