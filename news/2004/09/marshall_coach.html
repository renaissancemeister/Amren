<h1>Marshall Coach Apologizes For Referring To Buckeyes As &lsquo;Mandingos&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, DuluthNewsTribune.com, Sep. 15</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Marshall coach Bob Pruett has apologized for using a term that some consider to be a racial slur when speaking about Ohio State&rsquo;s football team.</p>
<p>In his weekly news conference leading up to last Saturday&rsquo;s game, Pruett called the Buckeyes &ldquo;a bunch of Mandingos,&rdquo; according to a story posted on USA Today&rsquo;s Web site Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means if it was offensive to anyone, I profusely apologize,&rdquo; Pruett said. &ldquo;I used it in an effort to explain superior physical ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trying to be complimentary. I would consider it complimentary if someone called me a (Mandingo) warrior &hellip;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it to be derogatory to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pruett should be reprimanded by Marshall for using the term, said Charles Farrell, director of Rainbow Sports, a division of the Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow/PUSH coalition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mandingos (of West Africa) were known as big, strong people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But their size and strength was an asset only for doing the work of slaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went out and said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s get ourselves a Mandingo because they&rsquo;re big and strong and they can pick cotton all day long or they can chop wood all day long.&rsquo; Even if you&rsquo;re trying to look for the original Mandingo connotation, it&rsquo;s totally misplaced,&rdquo; Farrell said.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Pruett also has described opponents including Florida, Tennessee, Western Michigan and Clemson as &ldquo;Mandingo warriors,&rdquo; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no place in football to refer to anybody as a Mandingo warrior,&rdquo; Farrell said. &ldquo;The usage is at best misplaced and at worst very derogatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Tolbert, who oversees the West Virginia branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the comment &ldquo;smacks of some racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sylvia Ridgeway, president of the NAACP&rsquo;s Huntington-Cabell branch, said Pruett&rsquo;s comments may have been the result of &ldquo;a poor choice of words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never, ever heard him make racial remarks before, which leads me to believe it was an indication of how he felt about strength and boldness, not anything negative,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ohio State athletic director Andy Geiger declined comment.</p>
