<h1><a href="/">First Fully Islamic Bank Opens in Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Sept. 22</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LONDON &mdash; Britain opened its first bank on Wednesday that promises to fully abide by Sharia, or Islamic, law, meaning it won&rsquo;t give or receive interest, and will invest only in ethical industries, a guideline that bars alcohol and tobacco companies. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to be opening our first branch. It marks a new era in Islamic banking in the U.K.,&rdquo; said Michael Hanlon, the managing director of the Islamic Bank of Britain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we can provide customers with a range of Sharia-compliant products and services,&rdquo; he said. But Hanlon also emphasized that they will be equivalent to those in conventional banks and competitively priced. </p>
<p>As he spoke, the bank showed off its first branch on Edgware Road in a fairly posh area of central London where some of Britain&rsquo;s 1.8 million Muslims live. </p>
<p>The Islamic Bank of Britain received authorization from the country&rsquo;s Financial Services Authority watchdog last month and will meet British banking regulations and consumer safeguards. </p>
<p>Other banks in the country already offer products that follow some Islamic principles, but they all originated with non-Sharia institutions. </p>
<p>Under Sharia law, it is forbidden to give or receive interest payments. Therefore, instead of offering interest on savings accounts, the bank will trade in Sharia-compliant investments and share the profits with savers. </p>
<p>Any money invested by the bank must be put into purely ethical industries, which bars ones handling interest payments, tobacco or alcohol. </p>
<p>To ensure the bank is operating according to Sharia law, Islamic scholars will sit on a supervisory committee that must approve the bank&rsquo;s services, investments and activities. </p>
<p>Since there are different interpretations of thought in Islam in the Muslim world, that could theoretically lead to scholarly disputes about the bank&rsquo;s compliance with Sharia. </p>
<p>The new branch began offering savings accounts Wednesday, both in person and via telephone or the mail, and the first three it started ranged from 1 pound ($1.80) to 100,000 pounds ($180,000), officials said. It plans to launch current accounts and loans in November, followed by mortgages, credit cards and business banking accounts in 2005. </p>
<p>The bank plans to open branches in Birmingham and Leicester in November, followed by eight branches in other parts of the country and internet banking next year. </p>
<p>To fund its expansion plans, the Islamic Bank of Britain is now offering 160 million shares priced at 25 pence (45 cents) each, with minimum purchases of 4,000 shares. </p>
<p>Last month, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that as the bank prepared to open it was funded by $25 million, most of it from investors in Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar. <br/>
