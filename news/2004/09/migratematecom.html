<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Migratemate.com, the world&rsquo;s first website to offer contacts for marriages of convenience, now has members in over a hundred countries. Migratemate.com, a website concerned with immigration rights, and the first in the world to offer contacts for marriages of convenience now has members in over a hundred countries.</p>
<p>The countries involved are Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Bulgaria, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guinea-Bissau, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Kitts, Saint Lucia, Serbia and Montenegro, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Sweden, Syria, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Migratemate.com&rsquo;s founder, James Franklin, said he had mixed feelings about reaching this milestone. He said: &ldquo;While we are happy that we are clearly offering something that is greatly needed, to offer a safe place for these individuals to meet, we regard it as a failure that so many people have been forced to come to us for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Franklin had been struck by how different the profiles were. He said: &ldquo;They come from such different backgrounds and have such different reasons for coming to Migratemate, and the only thing they have in common is the thing they all crave, and are denied: freedom. It is easy to talk about &lsquo;the immigration problem&rsquo; as if it is something abstract, and forget that it consists of individual people trying to deal with individual problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To remind people of these brave individuals, we have decided to let their own words speak for them, unedited and unaltered. They need no further comment, only an audience to consider them with an open mind and an open heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Migratemate.com is a site concerned with immigration and which believes in the basic human rights of movement and immigration, and offers a meeting place to those who, due to race, location, religion, sexuality are denied these rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.migratemate.com/"><div class="title">Migratemate.com Homepage</div></a></p>
<p>Despite the world getting smaller, the walls are getting taller. Borders are ever more rigidly upheld, immigration controls ever more draconian. Free trade has not been matched by free movement.<br>
In order to enter the country of their dreams, many people are then entering into informal arrangements, such as a marriage of convenience. Not merely for mere financial gain, many offer a free exchange of citizenship, a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Nor are these marriages confined to problems of immigration. There is common cause with other groups, such as gay couples unable to marry and so have basic legal rights, people wishing to satisfy the demands of family, society or religion. Also people from the military often seek to gain the preferential treatment married couples gain.<br>
Migratemate offers a safe place for these disparate groups to meet, exchange advice, develop friendships and even partnerships. Membership is free and easy, as is setting up a profile. Personal information is restricted and suppressed to ensure privacy.</p>
<p>Subscription to make contact ensures that time wasters are filtered out, and are secure and anonymous. Privacy for both the person who makes contact and the contacted is maintained through the double blind system, with both correspondents identity protected until they choose to reveal it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so quick and easy&hellip;so get going and get ready for a friendship, partnership &mdash; even citizenship.</p>
