<h1>Arrest Blamed On Culture Clash</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea Weigl, News and Observer, Sept. 4</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Lebanese immigrant facing sexual assault charges involving his infant son is caught in the middle of a culture clash between Western law and Eastern tradition. The Wake County courts will have to settle the question: Is the 24-year-old North Raleigh man a sex offender or an affectionate father?</p>
<p>Raleigh police have accused Charbel &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo; Hamaty, 24, of 5835-A Pointer Drive of first-degree sexual offense based on photographs of<br>
himself and his 6-year-old daughter kissing his 2-month-old son&rsquo;s groin area.</p>
<p>An Eckerd Drug employee contacted police after two of the photographs were developed there, and a search of Hamaty&rsquo;s home turned up a<br>
handful more. If convicted of the most serious offense, Hamaty faces life in prison. His daughter and son have been removed from the home and taken into the custody of a local social service agency.</p>
<p>The depiction of Hamaty as a criminal is disputed by both his lawyers<br>
and the more than 100 supporters who crammed a Wake courtroom twice<br>
this week for hearings related to the charges against Hamaty and his<br>
wife, Teresa.</p>
<p>The supporters, mainly from the local Lebanese community, wore red<br>
ribbons that said &ldquo;Support the Hamatys.&rdquo; They said the charges are the<br>
result of a misinterpretation of a half-dozen photographs among more<br>
than 100 snapshots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand why the police did this, but there are innocent<br>
explanations for all of this,&rdquo; said Raleigh lawyer Daniel Boyce.</p>
<p>Boyce has received offers of support from the World Lebanese Cultural<br>
Union, the Lebanese embassy and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination<br>
Committee, based in Washington. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re afraid there might be some<br>
cultural misunderstanding,&rdquo; said Kareem Shora, the committee&rsquo;s<br>
director of legal policy.</p>
<p>Such kisses are signs of affection, not sexual abuse, ruled the Maine<br>
Supreme Court in 1996 when it overturned a sexual assault conviction<br>
of an Afghan immigrant who was similarly photographed with his<br>
18-month-old son. The court ruled that the father kissing his son&rsquo;s<br>
penis was a common cultural practice and not a sexual act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kissing a young son on every part of his body is considered a sign<br>
only of love and affection for the child,&rdquo; the court said in its<br>
ruling. &ldquo;There is nothing sexual about this practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be looked at as a crime,&rdquo; said Ludwig Adamec, a<br>
professor emeritus of Middle East history at the University of<br>
Arizona&rsquo;s Center for Near Eastern Studies, who testified as an expert<br>
in the Maine case.</p>
<p>Hamaty, who works delivering pizza and three other jobs to support his<br>
family, is charged with first-degree forcible sex offense and two<br>
counts of sexual exploitation of a minor. His 34-year-old wife, who<br>
works as a nurse, is charged with two counts of first-degree sexual<br>
exploitation of a minor.</p>
<p>That the Hamatys took the photos to the drug store proves their<br>
innocence to the Rev. Claude Franklin of the St. Sharbel Maronite<br>
Mission, where the Hamatys&rsquo; relatives attend church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to do something illegal, you would use a digital<br>
camera and put them on the Internet,&rdquo; Franklin said. &ldquo;If you were<br>
doing something criminal, you wouldn&rsquo;t take the photos to Eckerd<br>
Drug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Thursday during a bond hearing, Boyce said the photos have been<br>
taken out of context. Plus, Boyce said, police found no child<br>
pornography in the couple&rsquo;s home and no Internet access. In support of<br>
reducing Hamaty&rsquo;s $500,000 bail, Boyce argued that Hamaty&rsquo;s release<br>
would pose no risk to the community, his children, the witnesses or<br>
evidence.</p>
<p>However, Assistant Wake District Attorney Jacquie Brewer argued that<br>
federal immigration officials have sought to detain Hamaty for<br>
potential deportation because his work visa has expired and he has<br>
failed to register with federal authorities as post-Sept. 11, 2001,<br>
laws require.</p>
<p>Boyce said Hamaty had hired an immigration lawyer more than a year ago<br>
to resolve a dispute with federal officials since he believes his<br>
status has changed by marrying his wife, who is a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>Wake District Court Judge Paul Gessner agreed to reduce the bail to<br>
$250,000 and allow electronic house arrest with a number of<br>
conditions. While out on bond, Hamaty cannot be alone with any<br>
children under the age of 16, must surrender all photographic and<br>
video equipment and can have no contact with his children or the<br>
witnesses.</p>
<p>Gessner also ordered Hamaty to cooperate with social workers in their<br>
investigation of the incidents. As of Friday, Hamaty was still being<br>
held at the Wake County Detention Center.</p>
