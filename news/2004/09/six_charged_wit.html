<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) &mdash; Six teenagers are charged with reckless homicide in the beating death of an eighth-grader who agreed to fight in hopes of joining a gang, authorities said Thursday. </p>
<p>Tarus DeShawn Williams, 15, was killed at Westside High School on Tuesday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To join the gang, you had to engage in a fight,&rdquo; said District Attorney General Bill Gibbons. &ldquo;And it was a fight that got out of hand.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A medical examiner said Williams died from a blow to the chest that crushed the left chamber of his heart. No weapons were used during the fight, authorities said. </p>
<p>Williams was found unconscious in a school restroom and pronounced dead a short time later at Le Bonheur Children&rsquo;s Medical Center. </p>
<p>Gibbons said he and other law enforcement officers often speak at Memphis schools warning youngsters to stay away from gangs. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of my message to students is if they become involved in gang activities, it&rsquo;s very likely the outcome will be either time in prison or an early trip to the cemetery,&rdquo; Gibbons said. </p>
<p>Westside has 670 students in grades 7 through 12. The youngsters charged in Williams&rsquo; death range in age from 13 to 15. They were taken into Juvenile Court custody and face imprisonment until age 18 if found guilty as charged. </p>
<p>They cannot be tried in adult court on reckless homicide charges since they are under 16. </p>
<p>Gibbons said the teenagers all were part of the initiation and can be held equally responsible for Williams&rsquo; death regardless of who delivered the killing blow. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That action resulted in a reckless act &mdash; the fight in the bathroom &mdash; making them all criminally responsible,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Williams family has said he was not part of a gang and had no desire to join one. He was described by classmates as quiet and friendly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a gang initiation for him to join the gang. It is our contention, based on the evidence we have at this point, that he consented to this initiation,&rdquo; Gibbons said. &ldquo;But he did not consent to a level of violence that would result in death.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Charged are Artavius Branch, 13, Tyrus Strong, 13, Damien Farmen, 13, Antonio Taylor, 14, Jeremy Henderson, 15, and Mack Lewis, 15. </p>
