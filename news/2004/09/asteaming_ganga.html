<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3618618.stm">&lsquo;Steaming Gang&rsquo; Given 25 Years</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Sep. 1</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five members of a &ldquo;steaming&rdquo; gang have been jailed for a total of 25 years for a two-week robbery campaign. </p>
<p>The self-styled Lords of Stratford Crew targeted people on London trains, Tubes and buses, Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court heard. </p>
<p>The jury was told that extreme violence was used yet they only stole items like small change and cigarettes. </p>
<p>The five were convicted of three counts of conspiracy to rob involving 12 victims last autumn. </p>
<p>Four of them were juveniles, but the judge, who described their &ldquo;gratuitous violence&rdquo; as &ldquo;dreadful&rdquo; and &ldquo;beyond belief&rdquo;, ordered them to be identified. </p>
<p>Other members of the gang are yet to be caught. </p>
<p>Steaming became the slang phrase used to describe attacks by gangs, usually involving excessive violence, on individuals on trains or buses. </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/09/steaming.JPG" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> Those involved had &ldquo;street tags&rdquo; like Killer, Packman and Driller and police believe they were in it &ldquo;mainly for the kicks and thrills&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The court heard victims would suffer a &ldquo;maelstrom&rdquo; of fists and feet and some were even stamped on and left &ldquo;virtually senseless&rdquo; by what one witness branded as a &ldquo;pack of wild animals&rdquo;. </p>
<p>One train passenger, builder John Tovey, told police he thought he was going to die as he was kicked in the head. </p>
<p>Mr Tovey is still unable to see properly and has had to give up work and move out of London. </p>
<p>Another victim, a lone woman was held in a headlock as several robbers took turns to hit her in the head, in front of dozens of other commuters. </p>
<p>She was then subjected to a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; sex attack. </p>
<p>Sentencing each to five years&rsquo; custody, with the teenagers serving their terms in a young offenders institution, Judge Henry Blacksell, said: &ldquo;It was, in my judgment, an aspect of this offending that you enjoyed the humiliation [of your victims]. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You picked on people who were weak and vulnerable  &hellip;  and not content with taking their property you beat them up. You targeted them. It was gratuitous violence.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Outside court, British Transport Police&rsquo;s Detective Constable Gary Wildeman, said: &ldquo;If this series of robberies had not been stopped when it was, I&rsquo;m sure we would eventually have ended up with a murder inquiry. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no morals, and no concept that others have feelings or rights. They are just totally ruthless  &hellip;  and on their own, complete cowards.&rdquo;</p>
