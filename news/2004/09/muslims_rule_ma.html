<h1>Muslims Rule Major Swedish City</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ali Dashti, Dhimmi Watch, Sep. 9</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><p>An exclusive series of translations from the Swedish press, made for Jihad Watch by Ali Dashti, who writes: </p></p>
<p><blockquote>Sweden is one of the worst hit countries in Europe of Muslim immigration and Political Correctness. Now, the police themselves have publicly admitted that they no longer control one of Sweden&rsquo;s major cities. I have made some exclusive translations from Swedish media. They show the future of Eurabia unless Europeans wake up. </blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>I&rsquo;ve seen the future of Eurabia, and it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Sweden.&rsquo; Malm&oslash; is Sweden&rsquo;s third largest city, after Stockholm and Gothenburg. Once-peaceful Sweden, home of ABBA, IKEA and the Nobel Prize, is increasingly looking like the Middle East on a bad day. </blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>All following links to major Swedish newspapers, with a brief translation:</blockquote><br>
<p>https://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,529910,00.html </p></p>
<p><blockquote>Malm&oslash;, Sweden. The police now publicly admit what many Scandinavians have known for a long time: They no longer control the situation in the nations&rsquo;s third largest city. It is effectively ruled by violent gangs of Muslim immigrants. Some of the Muslims have lived in the area of Roseng&aring;rd, Malm&oslash;, for twenty years, and still don&rsquo;t know how to read or write Swedish. Ambulance personnel are attacked by stones or weapons, and refuse to help anybody in the area without police escort. The immigrants also spit at them when they come to help. Recently, an Albanian youth was stabbed by an Arab, and was left bleeding to death on the ground while the ambulance waited for the police to arrive. The police themselves hesitate to enter parts of their own city unless they have several patrols, and need to have guards to watch their cars, otherwise they will be vandalized. &#147;Something drastic has to be done, or much more blood will be spilled&#148; says one of the locals.</blockquote><br>
<p>https://w1.sydsvenskan.se//Article.jsp?article=10092861 </p></p>
<p><blockquote>The number of people emigrating from the city of Malm&oslash; is reaching record levels. Swedes, who a couple of decades ago decided to open the doors to Muslim &#147;refugees&#148; and asylum seekers, are now turned into refugees in their own country and forced to flee their homes. The people abandoning the city mention crime and fear of the safety of their children as the main reason for leaving.</blockquote><br>
<p>https://w1.sydsvenskan.se/Article.jsp?article=10090830 </p></p>
<p><blockquote>ALL of the 600 windows at one of the schools in Malm&oslash; have been broken during the summer holiday. Window smashing alone costs the city millions every year. City buses have been forced to avoid the immigrant ghetto, as they are met with youths throwing rocks or bottles at them if they enter. Earlier this year, a boy of Afghan origin had made plans to blow up his own school. </blockquote><br>
<p>https://w1.sydsvenskan.se//Article.jsp?article=10093267 </p></p>
<p><blockquote>People working at the emergency ward at the major hospital in Malm&oslash; receive threats every day, and are starting to get used to it. Patients with knives or guns are commonplace. They have discussed having metal detectors at the emergency entrance, but some fear this could be seen as a provocation. </blockquote><br>
<p>https://w1.sydsvenskan.se//Article.jsp?article=10093495 </p></p>
<p><blockquote>Lisa Nilsson has lived in Manhatten, New York City, for 25 years. After moving back to Malm&oslash;, Sweden, she now misses the safety of New York. She never walks anywhere in Malm&oslash; after dark, but takes a taxi everywhere she goes.</blockquote><br>
<p>https://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?a=180423 </p></p>
<p><blockquote>Rapes in Sweden as a whole have increased by 17% just since the beginning of 2003, and have had a dramatic increase during the past decade. Gang rapes, usually involving Muslim immigrant males and native Swedish girls, have become commonplace. Two weeks ago, 5 Kurds brutally raped a 13-year-old Swedish girl. </blockquote><br>
<p>https://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,528363,00.html </p></p>
<p><blockquote>22-year-old Swedish woman going out for fresh air gang raped by three strange men. The only said one word to her: &#147;Whore!&#148; </blockquote><br>
<p>Ali Dashti comments: &#147;Stories like this are in Swedish newspapers every week. Swedish media usually take great care not to mention the ethnic background of the perpetrators, but you can usually read it between the lines.&#148; </p><br>
<p>One more: how have Swedish politicians reacted to the chaos caused in one of their major cities because of Muslims of whom even the police seem to be afraid? By making it easier for Muslims to enter Sweden: </p><br>
<p><a href="https://www.cphpost.dk/get/81008.html">https://www.cphpost.dk/get/81008.html</a> </p></p>
<p><blockquote>Sweden&rsquo;s politicians view arranged marriages as a positive tradition: a cultural pattern that immigrants should be allowed to preserve even in Sweden. The Swedish government feels that interfering in arranged marriages is an encroachment upon private life. In addition, immigrant couples can apply for family reunification in Sweden even if they&rsquo;ve never seen each other before&mdash;as long as the marriage is entered in a culture with a tradition of parents arranging marriages on behalf of their children. A 2002 study by V&auml;xj&ouml; University economics professor Jan Ekberg found that immigration cost Swedish taxpayers DKK 33 billion that year, compared to just DKK 10 billion in Denmark. And while one might assume that the rise in costs would result in knee-jerk opposition to immigration, just the opposite has happened in Sweden. A Swedish government commission has proposed abolishing the so-called &#147;seriousness requirement.&#148;</blockquote></p>
