			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick O&rsquo;Driscoll and Haya El Nasser, USA Today, Sep. 29</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DENVER &mdash; Twenty-one years ago, voters here chose Federico Pe√±a as the city&rsquo;s first Hispanic mayor. Eight years later, they elected Wellington Webb as their first black mayor. Webb won a contest in which both candidates were African-American &mdash; and 68% of voters were white.</p>
<p>Then last year, Denver picked its first white mayor in 20 years.</p>
<p>Today, Census data show that racial and ethnic minorities in Denver now outnumber whites.</p>
<p>No surprise here: Demographic shifts have rolled through Colorado&rsquo;s capital city for decades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to see the demographics are catching up to my appointments,&rdquo; jokes Mayor John Hickenlooper, a brew pub owner and downtown activist who has filled two-thirds of his top posts with blacks, Hispanics and Asians.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau estimates that Denver has 557,478 people &mdash; 49.4% white, 34.8% Hispanic, 10.6% black, 3% Asian and 2.2% other. An infusion of Hispanic and Asian immigrants is only the latest wave of change that has included shifting birth rates, a Sun Belt economic boom and modest &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; to Denver&rsquo;s sprawling suburbs.</p>
<p>Similar changes happened in 25 other U.S. counties since 2000, according to 2003 estimates. In some, the majority-minority scales are tipping because the white population is aging and immigrants are flowing in. That&rsquo;s the case in the 11 rural Texas counties where whites aren&rsquo;t the majority.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;90s, Hispanics made up 80% of the net growth in Texas Panhandle counties far from metropolitan areas, state demographer Steve Murdock says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growth, when it does occur, is all Hispanic,&rdquo; Murdock says. </p>
<p>In other states, the &ldquo;majority&rdquo; is shrinking because whites are moving to other states in search of jobs and a lower cost of living.</p>
<p>Estimates for July 1, 2003, show Texas had a 49.5% minority population, but other surveys say it has already surpassed 50%. Hawaii&rsquo;s minority population is 77%; New Mexico&rsquo;s, 56%; and California&rsquo;s, 55%. The District of Columbia is 72% minority.</p>
<p>Massachusetts lost as many non-Hispanic whites in the first three years of this decade &mdash; about 37,000 &mdash; as it did during all of the 1990s, says William Frey of The Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>This demographic upheaval is forcing the nation to rethink its definition of &ldquo;minorities.&rdquo; The country went through similar cycles in the past century. In the early 1900s, Italians, Poles, Russians and Greeks were not considered white. Now they are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black-and-white country made sense in the &lsquo;60s,&rdquo; says Roderick Harrison, a demographer at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. &ldquo;It makes much less sense now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hispanics, who can be of any race, are now classified as a separate ethnic group. But that could change, too. A large portion of third-generation Hispanics do not speak Spanish, and interracial marriage is growing, boosting the nation&rsquo;s multiracial population.</p>
<p>For more than a generation, Colorado&rsquo;s capital city was becoming much more diverse.</p>
<p>This week, Hickenlooper visited an adult English class whose 46 students came from 36 countries. On Wednesday, he visited an elementary school that four years ago was two-thirds black and now is two-thirds Hispanic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good time to be a Latino,&rdquo; says Estevan Flores, executive director of the Latino/a Research Policy Center at the University of Colorado-Denver.</p>
<p>He says Denver&rsquo;s growth is part of the &ldquo;Latinization of cities, counties and pretty soon, states.&rdquo; But growth of political power will take more time, he says, as Hispanic immigrants first must become citizens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, most Americans will be &lsquo;minorities,&rsquo; which is to say they are the new majority,&rdquo; says Robert Lang, head of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech.</p>
