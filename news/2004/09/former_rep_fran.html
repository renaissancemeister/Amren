<h1>Former Rep. Frank Ballance Indicted On Fraud Charges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Hartsoe, AP, San Francisco Chronicle, SFGate.com, Sep. 2</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Rep. Frank Ballance, who cited ill health in resigning from Congress in June, was indicted on federal fraud and money-laundering charges Thursday in connection with a drug and alcohol counseling program he founded. </p>
<p>The 62-year-old Democrat was indicted along with his son, Garey Ballance, who was charged with not filing a tax return in 2000. </p>
<p>Ballance resigned from Congress four months after being diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, a condition that results in muscle weakness. At the time, federal and state investigators were looking into the foundation. </p>
<p>A stinging state audit last fall found that the John A. Hyman Foundation was riddled with conflicts of interest and had made $325,000 in questionable payments. The foundation has received $2.1 million in state money since 1994, thanks in part to Ballance, a former state legislator. </p>
<p>The indictment claims Ballance used his office as a state senator to obtain more than $2 million for the foundation, and used more than $100,000 to benefit himself, his family, and a church where he served as chairman of the board of deacons. </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/09/ballance.JPG" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> The indictment also alleges he forged or caused the forgery of the notarized signature of a foundation official, and accuses him of concealing the proceeds of the fraudulent schemes. </p>
<p>Neither Frank Ballance, who was elected to Congress in 2002, nor his 34-year-old son could immediately be reached for comment Thursday. </p>
<p>Joseph Cheshire V, a lawyer for Frank Ballance, said the former lawmaker would surrender and appear in court Friday, and that he expects to reach a plea agreement. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t anticipate a trial,&rdquo; Cheshire said. </p>
<p>Boyd Sturges, an attorney representing Garey Ballance, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Ballance was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, mail fraud of money and money laundering &mdash; a charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His son faces a maximum of one year and a $100,000 fine if convicted. </p>
<p>Garey Ballance is accused of using $20,000 in foundation money to buy a new Lincoln Navigator, and not reporting it as required on his income tax return.</p>
