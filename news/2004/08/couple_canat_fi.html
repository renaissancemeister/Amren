<h1>Couple Can&rsquo;t Find Diversity In Churches</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Badie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Aug. 1</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>John and Tammy Amorosso see the big church billboards on our county roads.</p>
<p>They depict a rainbow congregation &mdash; blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians. Everybody&rsquo;s happy about their church.</p>
<p>They want you to join them for Sunday worship.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the Amorossos accept those invites, they leave disappointed. So often the church&rsquo;s racial makeup doesn&rsquo;t measure up to the impression left by the ad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky if you have one percent&rdquo; minority, said John Amorosso, 36, a physicians recruiter who works from his home in Dacula. &ldquo;Finding a church with a good mix of people has been kind of a struggle for us for quite a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Amorosso wrote me after reading a column about Jung Han, a Korean woman who worships at mostly black Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Norcross.</p>
<p>The Amorossos are looking for a church home &mdash; &ldquo;an integrated church,&rdquo; Amorosso wrote. &ldquo;Do you have any recommendations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, he told me that they are a biracial couple. He&rsquo;s Italian; Tammy, 38, is black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have two kids, and we&rsquo;d like to have our kids worship and be around people of different colors and ethnic backgrounds,&rdquo; Amorosso said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want them isolated one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family needs a church capable of performing a delicate balancing act &mdash; satisfying John&rsquo;s Catholic upbringing as well as Tammy&rsquo;s Baptist roots. Worship services can&rsquo;t be too staid or too high-energy.</p>
<p>When it comes to integration on Sunday morning, Victory World Church in Norcross comes as close to perfecting it as anyone. It&rsquo;s one of the few truly integrated houses of worship in metro Atlanta.</p>
<p>Dennis and Colleen Rouse, the church&rsquo;s senior co-pastors, are white. They preach racial inclusiveness, which explains the 4,500-member congregation&rsquo;s makeup: 60 percent black, 30 percent white and 10 percent Hispanic and Asian. It hasn&rsquo;t been easy to sustain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get to those 4,500, we have gone through thousands and thousands of people over the last 14 1/2 years,&rdquo; said Dennis Rouse, a McDonough native.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as some white people come in and don&rsquo;t like the style of music, or don&rsquo;t like the racial majority, they get up and leave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, they would never say it, but they prefer to go somewhere where they are not the minority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, we have black people who come to our church and like everything about it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;But some still prefer to be over there with &lsquo;the brothers&rsquo; in an all-black church. It&rsquo;s a challenge for our church, and it has cost us some people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked Amorosso what would be an ideal church setting. He&rsquo;d like a strong children&rsquo;s ministry, and a congregation where blacks make up at least 10 percent of the population.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I would know it when I see it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There would be a feeling there. Dr. King once said that the most segregated hour of the week is 11 o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning. It&rsquo;s a shame. If Jesus came back, he&rsquo;d look at us and say, &lsquo;You guys have got it all wrong.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
