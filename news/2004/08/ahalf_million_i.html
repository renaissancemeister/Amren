<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MADRID &mdash; More than half a million illegal clandestine immigrants in Spain could receive official papers legalising their position if they have a work contract under a new Socialist government scheme, union officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Between 800,000 and a million foreigners, mainly Latin Americans and North Africans, live as immigrants in Spain without proper registration, according to the union confederation the CCOO and UGT labour union.</p>
<p>The two organisations said at least half a million were working in the so-called black economy of unregulated labour, without official papers. </p>
<p>If they produce papers documenting their employment, they will be able to benefit from a programme of social integration of immigrants that the government will introduce next month, said Jesus Perez of the UGT executive.</p>
<p>The unions welcomed the government initiative because it &ldquo;deals with immigration from the viewpoint of the labour market and not as previously from a political or security viewpoint,&rdquo; said Perez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a means of attacking the parallel (black) economy which represents 20 percent of the gross domestic product in Spain,&rdquo; said CCOO immigration official Julio Ruiz.</p>
<p>Junior immigration minister Consuelo Rumi said Sunday the government would regularise the situation of all clandestine immigrants who can show they have a valid work contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a promise of work won&rsquo;t be enough,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>As part of a broad plan to be launched next month, the government will also issue residence papers for immigrants who blow the whistle on unscrupulous employers &mdash; those who employ immigrants without a work contract, Madrid&rsquo;s El Pais newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about easing the social integration of foreigners&rdquo; but also about combatting the black market in immigrant labour, Rumi said.</p>
<p>Rumi promised the government would be forbearing to employers who put their employees on a legal footing.</p>
<p>For others, &ldquo;sanctions will be tougher and inspections will be increased,&rdquo; she warned.</p>
<p>But non-governmental organisations were sceptical. The government was &ldquo;ingenuous in leaving regularisation of employees without proper papers to employers who have previously committed an offence in employing them without a contract,&rdquo; said Diego Lorente, spokesman of the NGO SOS Racism.</p>
<p>Spain is one of the main gateways to Europe of clandestine immigrants.</p>
<p>According to official figures, 23 percent who make it to Europe come in through Spain. </p>
<p>Thousands risk the hazards of the sea each year trying to get into Spain from Morocco or sub-Saharan Africa in frail open boats across the Strait of Gibraltar or via Spain&rsquo;s Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Eight-one have so far perished at sea this year in the attempt.</p>
