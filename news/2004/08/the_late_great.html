<div align="left"><i>Derrick Anderson and Samuel Taylor, American Renaissance, May 1994</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Two
facts – just two – explain almost everything about Miami: In 1960, the
city was 90 percent white; by 1990 it was only ten percent white. Virtually
everything else about Miami today – crime, poverty, race riots, cultural
decay, third-world squalor – follows from this astonishing change in population.
<p>To be sure, it is important to understand the mix of people who displaced
whites. Cubans, especially those who arrived first, have had a very different
effect from that of Haitians or Nicaraguans. However, no city could show
more clearly how dependent upon race and ethnicity are a city&rsquo;s character
and civility. No city could show more clearly that large-scale displacement
of whites marks the end of everything commonly thought of as &ldquo;American.&rdquo;
<p>Miami is one of the bellwethers for the nation that will result if the
silent invasion from the third world continues. It is therefore important
to know what has happened to the city and why.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First Came the Cubans</font></b>
<p>Cubans are now the dominant group in a city that is 63 percent Hispanic
and 27 percent black. Even Dade County, which surrounds Miami, is about
50 percent Hispanic and 21 percent black, with whites making up no more
than 29 percent of the population. Aside from a few quickly-shrinking enclaves
of white influence, Cubans control business, politics and culture.
<img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B1_swim.gif" height="246" width="185" align="RIGHT"><p>Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled to Miami after Fidel Castro&rsquo;s victory
in late 1958, but they did not come simply because it was near by. Florida
and Cuba have connections that are centuries old, and the post-Castro migration
was only part of a long history.
<p>From the earliest times, imperial Spain had ruled Florida and Cuba under
a single administration. There was no political border&nbsp;
between the two territories until Andrew Jackson conquered Florida, and
the United States annexed it in 1821.
<p>Even before the city of Miami was founded in 1896, the area had long
played a part in the ructions of Cuba&rsquo;s tropical politics. The South Florida
coast was an important supply route for Cubans fighting Spanish colonial
rule, and the smugglers and gun runners were largely unmolested by Americans
intent on building a vacation resort.
<p>The Spanish-American war brought American-imposed stability to Cuba,
but once the country tried governing itself, it reverted to <i>opera buffa</i>
politics. In his 1917 essay, <i>Gore in the Caribbees</i>, H.L. Mencken
describes the &ldquo;Latin exuberance&rdquo; of a failed revolution. &ldquo;It was an exhilarating
show,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;but full of strangeness for a Nordic.&rdquo;
<p>Revolutions routinely deposited refugees and counter- revolutionaries
in Miami, and former exiles would sail back to Cuba with the next violent
change in government. In 1933, for example, Gerardo Machado was overthrown
and Miami teemed with his henchmen. In 1952, Fulgencio Batista staged a
coup and his predecessor, Carlos Prio, packed his bags for Miami. In 1958,
it was Batista&rsquo;s turn to move north. All three are buried in Miami, where
residents got used to itinerant dictators and their hangers-on.

<p>The immediate effect of the Castro take-over was to <i>reduce</i> the
number of Cubans living in Miami. Many had been scheming against Batista
and streamed home in the wake of Mr. Castro&rsquo;s victory. They streamed back
to Miami when Mr. Castro began to build the workers&rsquo; paradise.
<p>The real exodus from Cuba did not start until a year or two after the
revolution, but when it came, Miami was the obvious destination. During
the Prio and Batista years, even middle-class Cubans took annual vacations
in Miami, and after airplane service began it was fashionable for rich
Cubans to take one-day shopping trips to Florida. The Cuban upper classes
escaped to a familiar and comfortable refuge.
<p>At first, Miami&rsquo;s whites ignored the post-Castro rush, confident that
like all previous waves of political casualties, it would wash out again
with the next coup. Moreover, the first crop of Cubans was the wealthy,
well-educated white elite who spoke English and slipped easily into Miami
society. However, by 1965, 210,000&nbsp;

Cubans had come to Miami, and by 1973 another 340,000 had boarded the twice-daily
&ldquo;freedom flights&rdquo; for Florida. The quality of immigrants steadily declined,
though few Cuban blacks and mulattoes had yet to come north.
<p>During this period the <i>Miami Herald</i> still reflected the views
of whites, and its editorials echoed rising alarm over the alien invasion.
However, Cubans fleeing from communism made first-rate cold-war propaganda,
and the federal government flouted the wishes of whites by welcoming the
Cubans as refugees. It was Mr. Castro who finally stopped the &ldquo;freedom
flights&rdquo; in 1973, but Miami&rsquo;s transformation was well under way. The first
wave of Cubans came to plot counter-revolution in the hope of going back
home; later waves expected to stay.
<p>Cubans quickly established a distinct community. They came not only
with a common nationality, but with a fierce anti-communism that set them
apart from the soft liberalism of America. They&nbsp;<img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B2_girls.gif" height="233" width="185" align="LEFT">employed
and did business with each other, continuing relations that had been established
for years. Some businesses simply moved across the Florida Straits. The
Caballero Funeral Home, for example, advertises that it was founded in
1858, at a time when Miami did not exist. It was founded in Havana.
<p>Many entrepreneurs had scant regard for American legalities or customs,
and they brought with them a corner-cutting, under-the-table mentality
that still characterizes Miami. However, Cubans were scrupulous in their
relations with each other because a violation of trust meant exclusion
from the community.
<p>The fact that well-off businessmen had come first made things much easier
for the later arrivals. Cane-cutters just off the plane were grateful for
any kind of work, and were both loyal workers and customers for Cuban businesses.
At the same time, perpetually rocky politics in Latin America sent north
a steady flow of flight capital. Naturally, it went to Miami, where nervous
Argentines and Colombians could count on fellow Hispanics to invest their
nest eggs in solid American banks.
<p>What was the effect of the Cuban presence on the Miami labor market?
One of the few &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; criticisms of non-white immigration is that
it displaces blacks, and it is widely maintained that this happened in
Miami. In fact, it was whites who were replaced. The garment industry,
for example, was 94 percent white in 1960, but by 1980, it was 83 percent
Hispanic. Black participation in the industry held steady at 5-7 percent.
<p>Likewise, in the hotel industry, when Cuban participation went from
18 percent to 40 percent between 1970 and 1980, this advance was entirely
at the expense of whites. During the same period, blacks <i>increased</i>
their participation from 14 to 23 percent – likewise at the expense of
whites, who saw their participation cut in half, from 68 to 34 percent.
<p>The professions saw the same trend. From 1970 to 1980, black participation
nearly doubled from seven to 13 percent. Cuban participation grew even
faster but, again, the only group that saw its numbers decline was whites.
<p>This was not because whites could not compete for jobs, but because
they simply moved away. The arriving Cubans naturally steered clear of
black neighborhoods and moved in among whites. This was the obvious choice
for the first group of well-to-do, light-skinned Cubans, and when poorer
immigrants began to arrive, they settled around the margins of already-established
Cuban areas. As neighborhoods became unrecognizable and unintelligible,
whites moved away. The departure of hundreds of thousands of citizens in
the face of an alien onslaught is the great, unrecognized tragedy of Southern
Florida. Blacks, whose uninviting neighborhoods were shunned even by poor
Cubans, were largely unaffected.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1980: Annus Mirabilis</font></b>
<p>By 1980, it was clear that Miami was sliding out of the European-American
orbit, but several events in that remarkable year confirmed it. One was
what became known as the Mariel boatlift. After a few Cubans successfully
broke Mr. Castro&rsquo;s travel ban and shipped out to Miami from the port of
Mariel, Cuban authorities decided to let anyone leave who wanted to. Miami
Cubans joyfully spent millions of dollars chartering boats in the hope
of freeing relatives, but most of the passengers turned out to be strangers.
Cuba made no secret that it was emptying prisons and mental hospitals onto
the waiting boats. &ldquo;Those that are leaving from Mariel,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Castro, &ldquo;are the scum of the country – antisocials, homosexuals, drug addicts,
and gamblers, who are welcome to leave Cuba if any country will have them.&rdquo;
<p>During 1980, 125,000 <i>Marielitos</i> floated across to Miami, 45 percent
of them with criminal records. They unleashed an unprecedented crime wave,
including as many as six airplane hijackings to Cuba in one week. Even
the most staunchly anti-Castro Cubans began to realize that accepting Mr.
Castro&rsquo;s scum was a mistake. &ldquo;The <i>Marielitos</i> are mostly black and
mulattoes of a color I never saw or believed existed in Cuba,&rdquo; marveled
one Cuban-American official.
<p>President Jimmy Carter, ever unmindful of the damage he was doing the
country, welcomed the boatlift as yet another testimonial&nbsp;

to America&rsquo;s greatness. He stopped letting the boats land only after Miami
Cubans themselves – disgusted with Mariel dross – told him to.
<p>1980 was also marked by the beginning of what has come to be almost
a biennial Miami ritual: black riots. A black man had died at the hands
of police under questionable circumstances, but a jury concluded no crime
had been committed. Blacks reacted with several days of riot, arson and
murder, during which they deliberately attacked whites. Eight whites were
lynched in a variety of colorful ways – set afire in their cars, beaten
with concrete blocks, stabbed, shot, run over – and scores barely escaped
with their lives. The Dade County court house was one of many buildings
put to the torch in an orgy of destruction that left $80 million in property
damage.
<p>Just to top off the year, 1980 also saw a rush of Haitian boat people.
About 60,000 paddled in between 1977 and 1981, and the largest number came
at the same time as the Mariel boatlift. This was no coincidence. A government
that was rejoicing in the arrival of criminals and mental patients could
hardly turn away able-bodied Haitians without being accused of racism.
As it happened, Haitians were bringing their own peculiar scourges: AIDS
and tuberculosis.
<p>They brought incongruity too. Some boats landed on exclusive beaches,
where sun-bathers gaped as starving, ragged blacks shuffled ashore. In
one famous incident, 20 bloated corpses from a Haitian shipwreck drifted
onto the powdery white sand behind expensive condominiums. Whites could
be forgiven for thinking that civilization was coming to an end.
<p>How did they react? In their civilized and utterly ineffectual way,
Dade County residents voted by a huge majority to prohibit the county from
conducting business or funding activities in any language but English.
In that fateful year of 1980, the forces of cohesion could manage no more
than this – and even this was worse than nothing.
<p>Cubans decided that the &ldquo;anti-bilingual ordinance&rdquo; was a huge insult
to them. Until then, they had concentrated their political energy on undermining
Fidel Castro. Now that whites (and blacks) had mounted a feeble attempt
to keep Miami from spinning completely off into the Caribbean, Cubans resolved
to remake the city even more explicitly in their own image. They began
to promote Hispanic causes not just in Cuba but in America as well. They
became U.S. citizens and ran for office. Thousands who had never bothered
with naturalization mouthed the words of the oath of citizenship and started
voting for fellow Cubans.
<p>By the time of the Falkland Islands war in 1982, Cubans and other Hispanics
were not at all inhibited about expressing partisan,&nbsp;<img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B3_shell.gif" height="133" width="215" align="RIGHT">ethnic
interests. Even Cuban-Americans who had fought with U.S. forces in Vietnam
helped raise money for the Argentines and joined rallies denouncing Britain&rsquo;s
campaign to retake the islands. Whites supported the British, out of cultural
affinity and respect for international law. Many were startled by the fierce,
ethnic solidarity that drove fellow &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; to support the Argentine
invasion. However, it was during the controversy over Nicaraguan immigrants
that Miami&rsquo;s Cubans clearly demonstrated their power to make national policy.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After Somoza</font></b>
<p>Just as Cuba had done, Central American countries had long used Miami
as a staging area for the series of farces that passed for politics. Thus,
when Anastasio Somoza felt support disappearing in 1978, he quietly bought
a $575,000 house in Miami. The next year, the Sandinistas persuaded him
to go live in it.
<p>The Nicaraguan exodus that then followed was like the Cuban exodus writ
small. The &ldquo;capitalists&rdquo; were the first to abandon ship, and by the early
1980s, Miami had a Nicaraguan-American Bankers Association. Ordinary Nicaraguans
did not start coming to Miami in large numbers until the mid-1980s, as
the Contra war wound down.
<p>Republican administrations did not welcome these newcomers the way Democrats
had welcomed Cubans. Ronald Reagan and George Bush thought the best way
to fight communism was for Nicaraguans to stay home and dust it up with
the Sandinistas. The government treated the new flood as illegal aliens
and tried to
<br>stop it.
<p>Cubans felt otherwise. They sympathized with their brother Latinos,
who were fleeing a familiar sort of tyranny. Also, Nicaraguans made good,
grateful stoop workers in the fields and seamstresses in the sweatshops.
The Cubans of Miami rose up against the deportation policy. At first, they
simply defied it. Any Nicaraguan who could make it to the city was swept
into a Hispanic network that immigration officials could not penetrate.
<p>Miami whites were actually talking angrily about the need to control
American borders, and the federal government&rsquo;s official position was to
deport Nicaraguans – to no avail. In 1986, the Justice Department threw
up its hands and announced that no&nbsp;

more Nicaraguans would be deported. All asylum seekers would get temporary
work permits while their cases were reviewed. Of course, this only increased
the flow, and by the second half of 1988, 5,000 Nicaraguans a month were
filing asylum claims. The Cubans had won and the nation had lost.
<p>Illiterate Nicaraguans quickly became a welfare burden. Clinics suddenly
found they were treating more Nicaraguans than anyone else. Schools were
swamped with yet more children who spoke no English. As usual, the city
gave way. There is now a Ruben Dario Street and a Ruben Dario Middle School,
both named after Nicaragua&rsquo;s best-known poet.
<p>It was about this time that the <i>Miami Herald</i> defected to the
other side. Cubans were incensed that it had run editorials in favor of
deporting Nicaraguans and in October, 1987, they bought a full-page ad
in the <i>Herald</i> to denounce the newspaper. There was talk of boycotts,
and spineless white editors quickly capitulated. Whites were leaving town
anyway, they reasoned, and Hispanics were not going to read a paper that
didn&rsquo;t promote their interests. Before long, the <i>Herald</i> was writing
cheerily that Nicaraguans would make wonderful contributions to the city
just as Cubans had. These days, its publisher, David Lawrence, urges whites
to learn foreign languages and looks forward to hearing <i>The Star Spangled
Banner</i> sung in Haitian Creole.
<p>Whites continued to put up ineffectual resistance. In 1988, a state
constitutional amendment to make English the official language of Florida
passed with 84 percent of the vote. One can only assume that a majority
of that size means that whites were overwhelming opposed to nonwhite immigration,
easy citizenship, liberal asylum laws, welfare for non-citizens, and all
the other measures that make a mockery of citizenship and turn whites into
refugees in their own land. But of course, they were afraid to defend their
interests as <i>whites</i> and hung their forlorn hopes on symbolic gestures.
<p>Just how symbolic they were was shown last year, when a newly confident
Cuban power structure overturned Dade County&rsquo;s English-only ordinance.
Miami is now free to conduct official business in Spanish. As the former
mayor of Miami, Maurice Ferre, has pointed out, &ldquo;Anglos&rdquo; have a choice:
They can learn Spanish or leave. It is hard to think of a more arrogant,
thankless attitude to the country that has welcomed newcomers, but the
<i>Herald</i>,
glorying in defeat, purred delightedly when the English-only rule was voted
down.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Blacks</font></b>
<p>Although thousands of Jamaicans, Trinidadians, and Tobagoans have moved
to Miami in recent decades, Haitians have set the tone for black immigration.
They have not always gotten on well with American blacks. The mulatto elite
tends to be responsible and hard-working and to look down on American ghetto-dwellers.
For the most part, though, the neighborhood of Little Haiti looks like
big Haiti: rows of clapped out buildings sitting in piles of trash. Of
course, there is a public school named for Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture, one of
the leaders of the Haitian slave revolt against France that&nbsp;<img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B4_sailing.gif" height="231" width="215" align="RIGHT">turned
into a race war. As in so many other Miami neighborhoods, an occasional
patrol car is the only reminder that this is, theoretically, the United
States.
<p>Haitian children have quickly acculturated – to the black sub-culture.
In the early 1980s, when they first started appearing in schools, American
blacks taunted them and beat them up because of their accents. Haitian
children quickly learned black slang, music, and misbehavior and all the
anti-white clich&eacute;s that nourish black resentment. Worried Haitian
parents watch helplessly as their children slip into the despised American
underclass.
<p>Blacks, whether Haitian or American, have never had good relations with
Cubans. Cubans generally ignore blacks, leaving the rituals of propitiation
to whites. After the 1980 race riot, it was whites who raised $7 million
for a Business Assistance Center to give money to black companies. Later
the center raised another $8.3 million, but much of the money was wasted
on black shysters, and the average rioter got nothing. Neither the city&rsquo;s
black set-aside program, which ran from 1982 to 1990, nor a series of enterprise
zones and tax holidays in black areas have alleviated the squalor. Every
riot brings a new infusion of tribute money, but nothing changes.
<p>Puerto Ricans – four percent of Miami&rsquo;s population and mostly poor –
have noticed this municipal largesse and decided to get some, too. In 1990,
they started their own little riot in the Wynwood neighborhood. &ldquo;The other
people, the black people, this is how they did it, and it worked,&rdquo; explained
a 17-year-old girl rioter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the invisible community,&rdquo; said Florida&rsquo;s
representative of the National Puerto Rican Forum; &ldquo;[T]his is the only
way we have gotten recognition.&rdquo;
<p>It is mainly blacks, though, who continue to burn down their neighborhoods
and then blame racism for it. They have seen Cubans, Nicaraguans, and even
Haitians pass them by, and now that Cubans largely run the city, it must
be Cuban racism that makes them fail. This raises an earnestly debated
question: Were Cubans always vicious racists or did they learn from whites?
<p>Cubans particularly angered blacks when they snubbed Nelson Mandela
during a visit in 1990. Miami officials were among the few people in America
with enough backbone to denounce Mr. Mandela as the communist admirer of
Mr. Castro that he was. This was an unspeakable crime in the eyes of blacks,
who started a campaign to drive convention business from the city. Blacks,
who neither study Spanish nor have the initiative to move away, increasingly
resent the Hispanic takeover of what they thought was an American city.
<p>Recently, racial animus got official recognition from an appeals court
judge. In 1989, Colombian-born policeman William Lozano killed two black
criminals who were about to run him down on a motorcycle. After the usual
two days of riot and arson, Mr. Lozano was convicted of manslaughter. In
1991, the appellate court threw out the conviction on the grounds that
Miami was so racially divided it could not possibly have given him a fair
trial: Blacks were ready to lynch him, while Hispanics paid his legal fees
– contributing as much as $150,000 after a single radio appearance.
<p>Racial cleavage got another official boost in 1992, when a federal judge
outlawed Dade County&rsquo;s decades-old system of county-wide elections for
commissioners, and carved out 13 separate districts, each with a solid
racial majority. Commissioners, the great majority of whom are Hispanic,
can now officially and openly represent their co-racialists.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Capital of the Caribbean</font></b>
<p>So what is life like today in the Capital of the Caribbean or the City
of the Future as boosters like to call it? It is possible, in the beautiful
neighborhoods of Coral Gables, Old Cutler Road, and Pinecrest in south
Dade County where wealthy whites live, still to believe oneself in paradise.
It is possible to glide from half-acre estate to private club to private
school, and remain in a world that is overwhelmingly white and civilized.
Most Miami whites even think they &ldquo;celebrate diversity.&rdquo; They speak a few
words of Spanish, and they know some light-skinned Latinos with impeccable
manners who appear to fit into their social class. Only dimly do whites,
in their golden enclaves, sense the rising tide of aliens – aliens who
hate them because they are rich, and despise them because they are weak.</p>
<center><img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B5_boardwalk.gif" height="97" width="385"></center>
<p>There are over 150 square miles of metropolitan Dade County that simply
no longer exist for whites. Here live the nearly 60 percent of county residents
who do not speak English at home. Here live the half of the population
of Miami and of Sweetwater that were not even born in the United States.
Here live the one in ten county residents who are illegal aliens.
<p>Every month, another 1000 foreign-born students enroll in the county&rsquo;s
schools. This year, there are more than 16,000 illegal students in the
system with a legal right to an education, which will cost the county $68
million. This does not include &ldquo;bilingual&rdquo; education costs such as the
salaries of 40 Creole-speaking teachers. It is difficult to teach this
mix of school children and many a career has foundered in the attempt.
The Miami school district had four different school superintendents during
a 14 month period in 1990 and 1991.
<p>Since the Haitians, Cubans, and Central Americans who keep coming have
nothing to offer an employer, Miami is poor. During the 1980s, the typical
Florida family enjoyed a 12 percent gain in income. In the city of Miami,
the typical family lost 12 percent. Half of the children under five live
in poverty, and the number of poor people rose during the decade from 25
percent to 33 percent. One in eight dwellings in the city is so run down
it should be demolished.
<p>A growing problem for Miami is people who are both poor and old. Many
former construction workers and sewing machine operators spent their lives
in the underground Hispanic economy. They have no retirement plans, no
social security accounts, and no savings. The taxpayer will have to keep
them in their old age.
<p>The taxpayer also heals the sick. In 1992, Jackson Memorial Hospital
alone staggered under an unpaid immigrant medical bill of $93 million.
Since 1990, Cubans have stiffed the hospital for $40 million, Haitians
for $26 million and Nicaraguans for $22 million. Spongers from virtually
every Caribbean and South American country have run up bills, including
$700,000 for Guyanese, of all people.
<p>Florida leads the nation in heterosexual transmission of AIDS, and today
one in every 40 Dade County residents is infected. Since each AIDS patient
costs about $85,000 from diagnosis to death, the county can expect to spend
something over $3 billion on the disease during the next decade. Many of
the dead will be women, so after New York City and Newark, New Jersey,
Dade County is likely to have more AIDS orphans by the year 2000 than anywhere
else in the country.
<p>Miami has also become a center for the practice of a quaint&nbsp; &ldquo;religion&rdquo;
called Santeria, which lower-class Cubans brought with&nbsp;<img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B6_rooster.gif" height="235" width="185" align="RIGHT">them.
Best known for ritual animal sacrifice, Santeria combines the outlandish
beliefs of African animism with equally outlandish borrowings from Catholicism.
One common ritual for driving evil spirits out of a house is to cut off
a chicken&rsquo;s head and drink the blood straight from the chicken. Miamians
used to be arrested for this sort of thing, and for hacking up goats, sheep,
dogs, turtles, snakes, and roosters during their worship services, but
in 1993 the Supreme Court decided that Santerian rites are part of a Constitutionally
protected religion. Sacrifices are now undisturbed, and children are excused
from school to attend them.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Top of the List</font></b>
<p>However, it is crime that is the most piquant spice that &ldquo;cultural enrichment&rdquo;
adds to the Miami stew. Some people still remember the 1950s, when Miami
was a white city and people did not think of locking their doors even when
they went on vacation. Now, they live behind steel bars, triple dead bolts,
and electronic alarm systems.
<p>Recently, Dade County has had the highest crime rate of any American
metropolitan area. Each year, the county reports 12.3 serious, FBI index
crimes for every 100 inhabitants, which puts it well ahead of San Antonio,
Texas, which is next with 9.5 for every one hundred. The county&rsquo;s crime
rate is fully 45 percent higher than that of New York City.
<p>Miami leads the nation in several crimes that are not even part of the
FBI&rsquo;s index. In 1990, more than 770 people were indicted for drug smuggling,
200 more than in the New York/New Jersey area, which came in second. Miami
is also America&rsquo;s favorite distribution point for counterfeit money; $50,000
in bogus bills go into circulation every week. Much of it is printed in
Latin America and comes in with drugs.
<p>Miami is also back to its old business of gun running, and may well
lead the world in this trade. Weapons obtained in Florida were used to
assassinate three candidates in Columbia&rsquo;s 1989 presidential election and
to stage a failed Islamic coup in Trinidad in 1990. Both the U.S. Customs
Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have their largest
offices in Miami.
<p>Violent crime has increased by more than 82 percent in the last ten
years, which helps explain why private security is a booming businesses.
Miami was one of the first cities in America to wall off entire residential
areas and hire off-duty cops to patrol them. Criminals are piling into
the jails at such a rate the judges order their release because of crowding.
Even the most dangerous convicts often serve no more than 30 percent of
their sentences.
<p>Some of the city&rsquo;s highest-profile crimes have been against tourists.
In a period of just a few months in 1993 and 1994, black thugs killed four
European tourists, and Miami temporarily stopped advertising itself as
a vacation spot. A favorite crime against tourists is to smash their car
windows and grab everything in sight. In 1990, there were 4,040 roadside
robberies, or 11 every day.
<p>In 1991, the Dade County Commission tried to protect tourists by making
it harder for robbers to tell which cars are rented. A new law forbids
rental of a car with company stickers on it, so when Miami rental agencies
turn around one-way cars from other cities, they have to scrape off all
the advertising.
<p>Miamians have gone numb to violence and degeneracy, and some even find
entertainment in it. On one occasion, police found themselves surrounded
by a crowd of 500 curious onlookers as they prepared to remove two decomposing
corpses from the trunk of a gold-colored Cadillac. People spent hours waiting
for the spectacle to begin, sipping lemonade, bouncing children on their
shoulders, and sniffing the odor of rotting flesh. The police tried to
block the view with vans, but people crawled under them. Others hurried
home for binoculars and stood on their own cars for a better look. There
was no sense of horror; just the happy buzz of a crowd waiting for a good
time.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Andrew Strikes</font></b>
<p>In 1992, Miami got an extra dose of third-world bad luck that was a
perfect metaphor for the past 30 years: Hurricane Andrew blew in from the
south, just like the immigrants, and wrecked 80,000 homes and 82,000 businesses.
One hundred sixty thousand shelterless people were left staring at $20
billion worth of property damage.
<p>Miami promptly ceased to be the capital of the Caribbean. Venezuela
sent no utility repairmen to help the city get back on its feet; they came
from South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. No Cuban or Dominican or Nicaraguan
churches sent food or set up&nbsp;<img src="../../../../news/2004/08/B7_card_house.gif" height="148" width="215" align="RIGHT">soup
kitchens; the Baptists and Presbyterians took care of that. And, of course,
it was the American Red Cross, the U.S. Army, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and the Salvation Army that came to the rescue. Oddly, no one complained
that the rescuers spoke only English. When it came time to staff the We
Will Rebuild Committee, who should step forward but the remnants of the
old&nbsp; &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; elite. &ldquo;We have no tradition of philanthropy,&rdquo; mumbled
the rest.
<p>The hurricane was a perfect demonstration of who invades and destroys,
and who pays the price. Somehow, no one noticed.

  <font size="3"><p>What a wonderfully revealing history this article is.  Born in 1955, my only &#8220;memories&#8221; of Miami, albeit living from afar, in Texas, is that it has always been infested with Cubans and other latins.  The only alternative view of Miami I&rsquo;ve seen is in old black and white movies from the 1930s and late 1940s.  Those depictions always seemed exotic but vital, a storm laced tropical land populated with genial White gentlemen in khaki or white suits.  Now, as we see from this article a decade old (and how much worse <span class="caps">ARE </span>things, ten years on?), Miami and south Florida seem like muddy chaos, a place whose denizens engage in endless murder, rape, robbery, drug running, and Third World plotting to wrest even more land from the American people stupid enough to allow them into the country in the first place.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I attended high school in Miami for the 1963-64 school year.  The first wave of Cuban immigrants was settling in   &mdash;   mostly professional and managerial types of obvious European extraction whose kids spoke perfect English.  Pep rallies at our high school, which had not yet been integrated, always included the singing of &#8220;Dixie.&#8221;  On the whole, Miami was a pleasant Southern city, albeit with more transplanted Northerners than Atlanta or Birmingham, that suffered no cultural disruption greater than the annual Yankee tourist invasion.</p>
<p>I left Miami in the Sixties.  My sister still lives in southern Florida, but she, her husband and their business have long since fled to a suburb of Fort Lauderdale.  The area where my old high school stands is called &#8220;Little Haiti.&#8221;  I understand that class reunions cannot, for reasons of safety, be held anywhere within miles of the school.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>AR has sometimes been judged as being too negative. Why not do an article on America&rsquo;s last great cities? Portland, Seattle and Boise still look like the West. One recent development of interest to AR readers is Louisville Kentucky, former headquaters of <span class="caps">AR.</span> A few years ago they expanded the city becoming the 16th largest in the country. Before it was 33 percent black now its around 25, I believe. It&rsquo;s as if they are trying to silence minorites. Louisville is the biggest city in America that is still over 70 percent white, and soon it may wind up as the biggest western city in the world that is still 70 percent white. AR never brings these tid bits up. Quick- Name the ten whitest states in America. If you can&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s because AR did not do it&rsquo;s job. Montana, Kentucky, Iowa, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Idaho. Since America&rsquo;s geography is of vital importance AR should discuss what parts of America are still habitable.<br/>
     Lexington is also in Kentucky. It is about eighty percent white. It&rsquo;s population is over 250,000. Louisville is 710,000, the second biggest city in the South, behind Jacksonville, Fl, which is very non white with 750,000 people.<br/><br/>
     Could Kentucky be one of the last stands for big Western cities? Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska may be the only states left with big white cities and it&rsquo;s to a lesser degree than the very white Kentucky. What if Europeans all over the world came to view Louisville as the Last Great City of the West?</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Note that this was written 10 years ago. Since then, Miami has deteriorated even further. It is now the poorest city in America. The area surrounding the Orange Bowl is such a war zone that the annual &#8220;Orange Bowl&#8221; football game is no longer played there; instead, it&rsquo;s played at Pro Player Stadium in extreme north Dade, where the Dolphins &amp; Marlins also play.</p>
<p>The article notes a county commission ordinance in 1991. A few years later, the state legislature had to drop the &#8220;Lease&#8221; label on rental car license plates because of the violence against tourists in Miami &amp; a few other places. <span class="caps">IMO, </span>one major reason specialty plates are so popular here in Fla. is because they don&rsquo;t show the county of registration; with such a plate, you don&rsquo;t give yourself away as being from out of town.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>It certainly puts to bed, all of the &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; mumbo jumbo of the Multi Cult. In particular, I like the points made regarding Miami&rsquo;s &#8220;African-American&#8221; community.

  <font size="3"><p>I am white and I love Miami !  I grew up there in the 1960s and 70s, and I go back home as often as possible.  I grew up in the Orange Bowl neighborhood, and some of the comments posted by readers of this article are so far off base that they must only come from an ignorant, racists mind.  The Orange Bowl game was not moved because of the &#8220;war zone&#8221; around the <span class="caps">OB, </span>but because Pro Player Stadium had 72,000 chairback seats, the OB none.  With no luxury skyboxes (i.e. money), or enough parking at the <span class="caps">OB, </span>the game was moved.</p>
<p>And to further illustrate my point, the new Florida Marlins baseball stadium is being proposed for this &#8220;war zone&#8221;   &mdash;  right next to the <span class="caps">OB.</span></p>
<p>I was in Miami recently, and I was able to take my 18 year old son to the Univ. of Miami/Florida State football game in the <span class="caps">OB. </span> He did not have the pleasure to grow up in Miami like I did.  It was a night game, and we fought as hard as players on the field to just find a parking space.  We weren&rsquo;t mugged, robbed, or assaulted. We saw no rapes, no drug deals, no drug wars <img src="/news/2004/08/We" alt="or chainsaws for that matter"/> We had a great time.  After the game we enjoyed a good meal in the neighborhood.  Welcome to Miami, bienvenedos a Miami !!!</p>
<p>The other thing that is apparent is that white people (outside of Miami, of course) cannot handle being a minority.  Hence, the dozen comments above mine.  All of you who hate your Miami experience get to know what it is like for the minorities who live in <span class="caps">YOUR </span>world.  Racism, discrimation, language barriers.</p>
<p>The joke really is on the white/anglo population.  You have been in the minority here since day one on Plymouth Rock.  You wiped out the indigenous people, but forgot that Spain/Mexico ruled places like Florida, Texas, California long before <span class="caps">YOU </span>got here !</p>
<p>America is still the only modernized, affluent nation that still celebrates, and basks in it&rsquo;s ignorance and prides itself in it&rsquo;s monolinguistic ways.  Millions of otherwise bright Americans are still content to let their child take French in high school for the purpose of being able to ask&hellip;&#8221;where&rsquo;s the bathroom&#8221; on their senior trip to Paris.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they are putting their own beloved child at risk because they refuse to learn the language of the gardner, landscaper, maid, or pool boy!  Anyone who cannot speak English, Spanish and is not computer literate is in trouble as this next generation emerges.  You can fight it all you want, but it&rsquo;s coming  &mdash;  and don&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned !!!!  It is not Islam that will rule the <span class="caps">USA </span>in the future.  Amaerica will be devoured from the south  &mdash;  -and there is nothing wrong with that!!!</p>
<p>To quote the words of Carlos Santana, when a caller called into to his <span class="caps">A&E</span> Live By Request tv special&hellip;the caller spoke little English, and so he asked Carlos if he coud make his song request in Spanish&hellip;and the truest words that were ever spoken on TV were said&hellip;.&#8221;You&rsquo;re in America now, <span class="caps">SPEAK SPANISH</span>&#8221;!!!!!</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Hopefully this will sink in! Why do you consider Haitains, Trinidadians, Tobagoans, etc. as just Black people, while at the same time considering Cubans just Cubans or Latinos/Hispanics? True, most Haitians, Trinidadians, Tobagoans and so forth are Black, but some are White and Multiracial.  Why is Cuba any different? 35 percent of Cubans are White, 11 percent are Black, and 52 percent are Multiracial. So logically when Black Haitains Tobagoans, and yes Cubans too immigrate, then they are Black regardless of their country or origin! White Cubans coming over likewise are White. Hispanic and Latino are cultures and ethnicities just as Anglo is.  They are not races and should never be treated as races! White Cubans are White, and Black Cubans are Black! It is inconsistant to separate Cuba from Trinidad, Tobago, Haiti, etc., by implying that White and Black Cubans are somehow different that White and Black Haitains! White is White and Black is Black whether one is Cuban, Haitain, Jamaican, Dominican, Tobogoan, etc., etc. You have 10 Whites (or Blacks) standing in a line, 2 are Jamaican, 2 are Haitain, 2 are Tobogoan, 2 are Trinidadian, and 2 are Cuban. Well, the 8 people that are Jamaican, Haitain, Tobagoan, and Trinidadian are White (or Black), but the 2 Cubans are neither, they are Hispanic/Latino or just plain Cuban. How blind and stupid is that!? If all 10 are White (or Black), then that&rsquo;s what they are for goodness&rsquo; sake! Hispanic and Latino are two greatly misused terms.  They are language/culture/ethnicity being used in a racial sense and that is very inconsistant to say the least. True Latins were White, Hispanics are truly Spaniards and thus White also! Cuban is a nationality, not a race! Much Abliged  &mdash;  -Billy</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I was born and raised in the so called &#8220;war zone&#8221; you speak of and never have I been so offended and upset by such bigoted remarks made about the place I lovingly call home. I have always been proud of Miami. It is a culturally diverse, beautiful landscape. The immigrants you say that are ruining Miami are some of the most hard-working, dedicated people one may ever have the pleasure of meeting. Doctors, teachers, carpenters arrive in Miami with their degrees meaning little or nothing at all. They clean your plates and mend your gardens for the oppurtunity to start anew. It is terribly sad that you see these people as a burden and not as your brothers and sisters. It is heartbreaking to think you have forgotten that part of your own past that is an immigrant too.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>As an afro cuban, I am not all surprised by any of these comments. I was raised in an African American society because we were not accepted in the white Cuban Society and certainly it was the American whites who gave us more respect. You would think that CUbans would be receptive of other monirites, however even some black Cubans hate themselves for being black because of the degenerative society that has been forced on them. So how do we cope with one another? We don&rsquo;t. We ignore one another on the streets, we move into white or mixed negihborhoods because to be a black Cuban in a society of Cubans who hate black/mullato Cubans is not easy. In thier eyes we are the scourge of society, even in our native Cuba. We don&rsquo;t all deny our blackness, because for far too many of us it is inescapable! I don&rsquo;t consider myself latino, and never have. Latins are speakers of the Latin language no matter how the American government attempts to classify people. Black is not Black in Africa.  Africans are so named by their native country, ie Namibians, Somalians, Egyptians, Ethiopians etc; White americans are Americans, however a black person who is American is black! It angers me that even so called cubans fall into the american stigma of what black is! Cubans blood is so infused with African Blood! </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I&rsquo;ve been to Miami countless times.  Also West Palm and Ft. Lauderdale.  Like any big city there is tons of trouble to get caught in.  I&rsquo;ve gotten off on the wrong exit enough times in South <span class="caps">FL. </span> But at the same time the places I usually go the &#8220;touristy&#8221; places are filled with rich people and if you don&rsquo;t drive anything over a 70K car you get dirty looks.  West Palm, Ft. Lauderdale, and Miami are like that.</p>
<p>And while I agree with most of the comments here.  Trash is trash.  I live in FL (farther N) and I&rsquo;ve been to places with no minorities and it&rsquo;s just as scary as some slums in Miami. I&rsquo;ve pumped gas in places filled with trailer parks trying to avoid getting jumped by 10 hicks for whatever reason. You notice most of the educated and somewhat successful ppl of the world are &#8220;nice&#8221; regardless of race, etc. </p>
<p>The problem overall is letting trash in the country.  Before people used to migrate here with 10 dollars in their pocket&hellip;start a business, or get an education, make a good living, earn the respect of their neighbors as &#8220;good people&#8221;.  Now it seems any crack addict can come over.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Screw Miami! If some of you Miami supporters are going to defend the &#8220;hard working immigrants&#8221; then you better also acknowledge that Miami is still one of the poorest, crime-infested cities in all of America. (not to mention all the drug cartels from Colombia) Hey, for you people who like diversity, you sure can get a diversified drug stock from the streets of Miami. (take your pick; marijuana, cocaine, pot, weed)</p>
<p>Hispanics in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>are largely responsible for most of the crime and poverty in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> They now even outnumber the blacks. At least black people can speak English. </p>
<p>However, one city that has the whites as a minority but that is much more prosperous than Miami is New York City. However, <span class="caps">NYC </span>doesn&rsquo;t have Hispanics as the majority. (its immigrant populations are more evenly divided) Whites:33% Blacks:25% Hispanics:27& Asians: 15%. </p>
<p>If Miami needs any type of immigrant, its gotta be the Asians. Asians are generally smarter and more prosperous than Hispanics. This is why <span class="caps">NYC </span>and LA are <span class="caps">WAY BETTER THAN MIAMI</span>!!!</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>Good bye, Ft. Lauderdale.  I loved this article, because I thought it was only <span class="caps">ME. </span> I want to see an anglo in South Florida. But, Florida is finished.  Sadly.  I don&rsquo;t want my little girl to emulate immodesty she sees at the malls that the latino teens seem to think is sexy. I don&rsquo;t want to hear loud banter at inappropriate times.  I want to see attentive mothers in shopping malls.  I want to see some naturally blond hair.  I want to be around some people who cherish <span class="caps">CIVILITY. MODESTY. EDUCATION.

<p>I am making my exodus.  My family, by business, my tax dollars. I have found a place where white people are still in the majority, the black people are mostly like the white people  &mdash;  they have their pants up, and no gold teeth.  I don&rsquo;t  see a color difference there.  A city of Colon Powells is fine with me.  I cannot wait to move.  I want to go now.  The latino community and the black community can have all of Broward and <br/>

  <font size="3"><p>In Cuba, <span class="caps">USA </span>is officially named &#8220;United States of North America&#8221; (North America) and it&rsquo;s citizens are called &#8220;Unitedstadians&#8221; or &#8220;north americans.&#8221;  (Many cities have an &#8220;Avenue of the Americas&#8221;   &mdash;   plural   &mdash;    because there is more than one America.)  Cuban are Americans.  (We are not Europeans)  In Cuba, there is a &#8220;very light skinned race&#8221; people because they are &#8220;white&#8221; people just like the Spaniard are white and look like regular white Europeans.  In Cuba there are blacks and people of mixed races, <span class="caps">JUST LIKE</span> IN <span class="caps">THE UNITED STATES</span> OF <span class="caps">NORTH AMERICA. </span> And because there are a lot of black north americans, that does not means that there are no people who are white in north america.  Same with Cubans.  It is very insulting to a Cuban who is white to be considered not white.  In your article the folk you call &#8220;white&#8221; the Cubans call &#8220;gringos&#8221; who are white just like the Cuban whites who are white.  Cubans who are white intensely descriminate against blacks, are very proud to be white, and get insulted when the term &#8220;white&#8221; is used excluding them.  Having said that, my first boyfriend (in Cuba) was light skinned, and was blond with blue eyes, but his hair was kinky   &mdash;   had an Afro.  Immediately, upon my grandmother learning about him, she gave me a lesson on how to tell if a white person has black blood and opened my eyes to the fact that there was a &#8220;problem&#8221; with that boy.  I was instructed by her and she opened my eyes to discrimination, because discrimination is learned and I learned that Cubans who are white, unmixed with another race, like my family, are very proud to be white and want to remain that way.  Consequently, I was separated from that boy in my youth, in 1960.  Finished growing up in New York City where Cubans had their our own clan.  We only invited white Cubans to parties and once when a boy who was a light-skinned &#8220;mulatto&#8221; showed up, none of us girls would dance with him.  An additional brainwashing I suffered was to <span class="caps">NEVER </span>return to Cuba.  Then I grew up and life was tough and I suffered much.  In 1994 I inquired about that boy with the Afro and when I learn he was single, immediately I was UNbrainedwashed and decided to go to Cuba to see him (34 years later).  I had to keep the trip secret for a Cuban man threatened to kill me if I went to Cuba.  But I went, saw my childhood boyfriend and married him, and he is the best thing that ever happened to me.  (He no longer has an Afro because he is now bold.)  When I accepted what destiny had for me, some old girlfriends were shocked, and at a party one even refused to dance with my husband.  I felt bad for him and have never told him why, but you know why.  It was by overcoming my learned discrimination what has opened the door to my happiness.  Therefore, so what if Miami has lost much of the gringos (what you call &#8220;whites&#8221;)?  Is that was happiness is about, having gringos only in Miami?  No.  Happiness is spiritual.  When I became colorblind, I saw the man&rsquo;s soul.  What has happned to Miami is the product of a new era, a new experience, a new generation, a new opportunity, freedom to exist, freedom to speak, freedom to perhaps someday be fully colorblind though sorrounded by a rainbow of many skin colors.</p></font><p>Posted
