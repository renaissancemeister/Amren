<div align="left"><i>Lawrence Auster, American Renaissance, Aug. 1994</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>Underlying everything we have heard at this conference [<i>American
Renaissance</i> conference of May 28-30] are two bedrock truths about race
and race relations that go against everything we have been taught. The
first truth is that there are significant differences in average intelligence
between differentb populations, and that such gaps in intelligence cannot be closed by any
known human means.
<p>The second truth is that not all groups are equally assimilable to each
other, in the sense of the ability to come to share a common outlook, identity
and way of being. The greater the historical and racial differences between
two peoples, and the greater the numbers involved, the harder assimilation
is going to be, and the more likely it becomes that conflict between such
different peoples will be permanent.&nbsp;
<p>Today&rsquo;s liberal and conservative orthodoxies hold the opposite beliefs
– first, that all racial groups are equal in inherent abilities, and second,
that all racial groups in the world, no matter how different, are at bottom
basically alike and equally assimilable into American culture.&nbsp;
<p>The first belief, in the equality of abilities, leads to the notion
that any actual differences in achievement between races must be due to
discrimination, which is to be overcome by preferential racial quotas.
The second belief, that everyone in the world is equally assimilable, has
led to an immigration policy based on what are in effect racial quotas
applied to the entire world. The continuing influx of over a million immigrants
per year, 90 percent of them non-Europeans, combined with higher nonwhite
birth rates, is steadily turning America into a multiracial, nonwhite country
– a &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; of the entire world.&nbsp;

<p>A good way to understand the impact of massive nonwhite immigration
on American society is to compare it to the impact of&nbsp;
preferential minority admissions in the university. As Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza has
described it in <i>Illiberal Education</i>, universities admit underqualified
minority students, while assuring them that they are perfectly well qualified.
When these students find themselves having academic difficulties, they
blame &ldquo;institutional racism,&rdquo; then they blame the curriculum itself, which
they say is culturally alien to them.&nbsp;
<p>The administration, not wanting to admit the truth, eagerly agrees with
the minority activists that racism is at work. In effect, the administration
makes the entire university community, especially the white students and
the faculty, the scapegoat for a racial inequality <i>that was created
by the administration itself</i> when it admitted unqualified minorities.
The school then sets up coercive&nbsp; &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; programs and speech
codes aimed at whites, and adopts multicultural curricula and intellectual
standards that conform to minority cultures and &ldquo;learning styles.&rdquo; When
white students protest these things, the minorities, in D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s words,&nbsp;
&ldquo;conclude that they have discovered the latent bigotry for which they have
been searching.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>In sum, the result of admitting large numbers of unqualified minorities
into a university is that whites start to be demonized as racist and are
systematically silenced, while their civilizational heritage is attacked
as unrepresentative and illegitimate and begins to be systematically dismantled.&nbsp;
<p>Now if all these things happen when you admit large numbers of nonwhite
students into a predominantly white school, what happens when you admit
massive numbers of nonwhite immigrants into a predominantly white society?
The very same things. The failure of the nonwhite population to fit into
the society is blamed <i>on the society itself</i>, rather than on the
fact that they were admitted in the first place. The white majority starts
to be demonized as racist and is systematically silenced, while its civilization
is attacked as unrepresentative and begins to be systematically dismantled.
The great irony is that the admission of nonwhites is supposed to prove
that the society is nonracist and egalitarian, yet the more nonwhites are
admitted, the more racist and unequal the society seems.&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Impact on American Life&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>While the &ldquo;delegitimizing&rdquo; impact of unassimilable immigrants can be
seen in many areas of American life, in no other field is it more obvious
than in the arts. Cultural institutions in cities with large third-world
populations are rapidly abandoning the Western high culture tradition in
favor of third-world folk cultures. According to music critic Edward Rothstein
writing in the <i>New Republic</i>, the new immigrants simply aren&rsquo;t interested
in Western music:&nbsp;
<p>&ldquo;[S]trikingly in a city like New York, [classical music culture] is
largely a racially stratified culture as well: there are almost no black
or immigrant faces (aside from Asians) to be seen in concert halls&hellip;
. My neighborhood arts organization, like many others around the country,
has been unsuccessful in marketing Western art music to the new racial
and international communities in the area. So instead they&rsquo;ve begun presenting
the folk musics of immigrant and black cultures.&rdquo;
<p>The same applies to the theater. &ldquo;The reason that Broadway appeals less
to New Yorkers these days,&rdquo; writes theater critic Thomas Disch, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
just that Broadway has changed: so have New Yorkers&hellip; . [A] glance around
the lobby at any Broadway show reveals who isn&rsquo;t there: any of the city&rsquo;s
readily identifiable minorities – blacks, Hispanics, Asians &hellip; .&rdquo;&nbsp;
<center>
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/lyre.gif" height="183" width="380"></center>
<p>Theatrical companies have tried to address the problem by introducing
multiracial casts into Western plays, but have been disturbed to find that
the audiences for such multiracial productions are still almost exclusively
white. Evidently, third-worlders are simply not attracted to Western theater,
even when it has lots of nonwhites in the cast. Since changing the cast
doesn&rsquo;t work, the only solution will be to give up the plays themselves.
The irony is that these problems, are not seen as the result of nonwhites&rsquo;
lack of interest in Western culture, and therefore as proof of their non-assimilability;
rather, Western culture itself is blamed for not appealing to nonwhites.
<p>Artistic images of American history are also coming under attack. Rush
Limbaugh recently noted that the state of Oregon, after commissioning a
beautiful bronze statue of a 19th century pioneer family, had rejected
the completed statue because the image of a white pioneer family was considered
&ldquo;racist&rdquo; and &ldquo;noninclusive.&rdquo; While Rush was unusually upset about this
incident, it didn&rsquo;t seem to occur to him that it had anything to do with
demographic change – i.e., that it is our society&rsquo;s increasingly nonwhite
character that is making any &ldquo;all-white&rdquo; image seem unrepresentative and
therefore illegitimate.&nbsp;
<p>In 1993 there was an angry protest by black and Hispanic students at
the University of Massachusetts who wanted the school to dump its official
symbol, the Minuteman. The image of a&nbsp; &ldquo;white man carrying a gun,&rdquo;
they charged, was racist. For the time being the school has resisted this
demand. But for how long? As the university&rsquo;s white population continues
to decline, can we expect the Chinese and Pakistani students and administrators
of the future to care enough about the image of the Minuteman to defend
it against intimidating black and Hispanic protesters? Who will preserve
the symbols of our Anglo-European national heritage after whites are gone?
<p>Indeed, who will defend that heritage even now, while whites are still
the majority? On Long Island this past Spring, a school production of <i>Peter
Pan</i> was canceled at the last minute, after six weeks of rehearsals,
because the town&rsquo;s American Indian minority felt that the play&rsquo;s portrayal
of Indians (which, remember, is simply a childlike fantasy taking place
in Never-Never Land) was insulting to them. So, to accommodate multiracial
America, this classic play that we all remember with fondness from our
childhood is to be proscribed. The most significant thing about the incident
was that no one in the town, including the parents whose children had their
play taken away from them, seriously protested this outrage.&nbsp;
<p>In an even more horrifying example of white surrender, an elite private
school in New England was considering hiring a well-known multicultural
curriculum consultant when it was discovered that the consultant – a Caribbean-born
black woman based in Toronto – had admitted in a published interview that
her approach would make white children feel intimidated and guilty. After
some discussion, the school&rsquo;s board of trustees went ahead and hired her
anyway.&nbsp;
<p>These are examples of what is happening to our entire country and culture.
As America becomes more and more nonwhite, everything we think of as the
American culture and identity will be either censored, squeezed out or
transformed into something else.
<p>The response of establishment conservatives to these concerns is to
say that such problems are created not by immigrants but by alienated white
elites, as well as by the general moral decay of our society. &ldquo;It is true
that radical and liberal elites in education, government, and media appear
to be doing everything they can to destroy whatever is left of traditional
America, and they might well be doing so even if there were no immigrants
at all.&rdquo; But we must understand that even if there were no &ldquo;cultural revolution&rdquo;
going on in this country, the kind of massive demographic change we are
experiencing as a result of immigration would still be enough, by itself,
to destabilize and ultimately destroy our culture.&nbsp;
<p>The list of horrors proving this point goes on and on: the dominance
of Latin American mores and language in southern Florida; the transformation
of southern California into an outpost of the third world; multiracial
juries unable to reach verdicts&nbsp;

because jury members don&rsquo;t share any common understanding of reality; the
exodus of hundreds of thousands of whites from immigrant-intensive areas
every year; the booming population of Southeast Asian refugees that will
make a town like Wassau, Wisconsin (which was 99 percent white 15 years
ago) a Hmong-majority city in a generation; the Santeria animal sacrifice
cult from the Caribbean; Muslim extremism and terrorism; expanding Chinese
and other foreign-based criminal networks; the takeover by Dominican drug-dealers
of upper Manhattan, where Dominicans marched with huge banners denouncing
&ldquo;500 Years of Genocide&rdquo; after a Dominican drug dealer was killed by a police
officer in self-defense.&nbsp;
<p>These and many other disorders are occurring not because of cultural
radicalism or affirmative action or middle-class moral decay. They are
happening as the direct result of revolutionary changes in this country&rsquo;s
ethnic and racial make-up.&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Weapon of &ldquo;Race-neutrality&rdquo;</font></b>
<p>What is it that prevents whites from protesting their own demographic
and cultural dispossession? The most common explanation is that people
fear being called racist. That is true, and it&rsquo;s not just political correctness.
Deep in the American mind is the ideal of America as a country where advancement
is open to anyone, where &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your parents were.&rdquo; The
fatal problem with that formula is that it can work only within certain
limits – when you&rsquo;re speaking of individuals sharing a basic commonality.
If you apply it <i>en masse</i> to radically diverse populations, it becomes
absurd and dangerous. The ideal of&nbsp; &ldquo;race-neutrality,&rdquo; applied to
incommensurable groups, turns out to be not race-neutral at all, but becomes
a weapon used by one race to dispossess the other.&nbsp;
<p>I came across a remarkable example of this in the coverage of the South
African election. Amidst all the media&rsquo;s joyous talk about a&nbsp; &ldquo;nonracial&rdquo;
or &ldquo;multiracial&rdquo; democracy being born, <i>Newsweek</i> came out with a
sensational cover with bold letters crying &ldquo;Black Power!&rdquo; So deep is the
doublethink in which we live today, that I wonder if more than a handful
of people noticed the gross contradiction of celebrating black power in
what was supposed to be a &ldquo;nonracial&rdquo; election. But of course it&rsquo;s not
a contradiction at all: What &ldquo;nonracial&rdquo; really means is that it is <i>whites</i>
who are supposed to be indifferent to race, in order to help nonwhites
advance <i>their</i> racial interests.&nbsp;
<p>This same double standard and delusion works across the board. For example,
the belief that all the peoples of the world are equal in intellectual
abilities is thought to be a race-neutral or &ldquo;nonracial&rdquo; idea, since it
is saying that race doesn&rsquo;t matter. But since the races are <i>not</i>
equal in average abilities, this &ldquo;nonracial&rdquo; belief in equality turns out
to be completely racial. It holds that blacks have far greater abilities
than they in fact have, and invariably blames white racism for actual black
inequalitiy. It is therefore the duty of whites, until the end of time,
to exhaust their wealth and spiritual energy in a hopeless effort to make
blacks collectively equal to themselves. The &ldquo;nonracial&rdquo; belief in equality
thus turns out to be a kind of black racialist mythology.&nbsp;
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/immig.gif" height="140" width="185" align="RIGHT">Similarly, our
immigration policy, which is thought to be race-neutral, is in fact turning
America into a nonwhite country, dispossessing white America and its culture.
Yet it is considered &ldquo;racist&rdquo; to oppose this policy, and &ldquo;nonracist&rdquo; to
support it.&nbsp;
<p>Ultimately the pursuit of race-blindness (in anything more than a legal
and procedural sense), leads to complete incoherence. Columnist Jon Carroll
of the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i> once complained about the fact that
we are supposed to respect everyone&rsquo;s differences, while at the same time
we&rsquo;re supposed to treat everyone equally – which requires us not to notice
differences at all. Carroll continues:&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;One is required to deny the evidence of one&rsquo;s senses. I perceive
that African American men are different from Caucasian men are different
from Asian women are different from (what?) Ethiopian Jews. Can we compare
these differences? No, we cannot. We may say for the record that these
differences are beautiful, equally beautiful, precisely geometrically equally
beautiful, but that&rsquo;s it.
<p>And if we do begin to compare these differences, Carroll says, that
leads us right back to value judgments about racial differences, which
immediately devolve into &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>Paralyzed by these contradictions, as well he should be, Carroll concludes:
&ldquo;I think intermarriage may be the only way out &hellip; . Of course, we&rsquo;d
lose a lot of interesting specific cultures that way . . &rdquo; What he means,
of course, is that we&rsquo;d lose a lot of interesting races that way, including
our own.&nbsp;
<p>Along the same lines, but with far more enthusiasm, Morton Kondracke
in the <i>New Republic</i> wondered how America could overcome its racial
inequalities, and concluded that racial intermarriage is the only solution:
&ldquo;It would be a lot easier if each of us were related to someone of another
color and if, eventually, we were all one color. In America, this can happen.&rdquo;
Racial intermarriage is even more aggressively championed by Ben Wattenberg,
who sees it as the path to universal salvation.&nbsp;
<p>I want to make the meaning of all this very clear. Modern liberalism
told us that racial differences don&rsquo;t matter, and on the basis of that
belief, liberals then set about turning America into a multiracial, integrated,
race-blind society. But now that very effort has created so much race consciousness,
race conflict and race inequality, that the same liberals have concluded
that the only way to overcome those problems is to merge all the races
into one. The same people who have always denounced as an extremist lunatic
anyone who warned about &ldquo;the racial dilution of white America,&rdquo; are now
proposing, not just the dilution of white America, but its complete elimination.
Race-blind ideology has led directly to the most race-conscious – and indeed
genocidal – proposal in the history of the world.&nbsp;
<p>This is the insanity that results from uncritically accepting the idea
that race doesn&rsquo;t matter. And the moral paralysis of whites in the face
of immigration comes from the terror or distaste that they feel at saying
that race does matter. There is also whites&rsquo; inability to face the fact
that they are a civilizationally distinct group – comprising only 15 percent
of the world&rsquo;s population – that is demographically threatened by the rest
of the world&rsquo;s desire to live in the uniquely attractive societies that
whites have created.&nbsp;
<p>If whites continue to be open to nonwhites, as their race-blind moralism
tells them they must, their societies will cease to exist; but if they
exclude or disengage from nonwhites, that will require them to be &ldquo;harsh,&rdquo;
&ldquo;unkind,&rdquo; &ldquo;mean-spirited.&rdquo; It will require them to say that they care about
the survival of their race vis-a-vis other races. To the contemporary white
person, such an idea is utterly evil and unacceptable. But the funny thing
is, there is really nothing&nbsp;

evil or horrible about it at all. It turns out to be the most reasonable
and commonsensical thing in the world. It&rsquo;s the current race-blind ideology
that is insane.&nbsp;
<p>So before we recoil in horror or embarrassment from speaking explicitly
about race, let us remember that America&rsquo;s current politics is already
a race-conscious politics, only it&rsquo;s a politics based on <i>lies</i> about
race. It&rsquo;s a politics directed against whites and their civilization. And
it pretends that it&rsquo;s not about race at all, but that it&rsquo;s race-neutral
and universal. So instead of today&rsquo;s race-conscious politics, which is
based on lies about race, let us have a race-conscious politics based on
truths about race.&nbsp;
<p>These truths include the following propositions:
<blockquote>Long-term harmonious relations between a racial majority and
racial minorities are possible only when the minorities do not exceed a
certain percentage of the population.&nbsp;
<p>While individuals of different races living in the same society can
get along on a basis of equality and mutual recognition, entire races,
living in the same society, cannot.&nbsp;
<p>In the right circumstances, individuals or small groups of one people
can be assimilated into a host culture of a different people, but there
are limits to such assimilation. Certainly if the entire people associated
with the host culture is displaced or swamped by a different people, the
host culture will also disappear. Even smaller shifts in numbers can be
enough to delegitimize the host culture and produce chronic cultural conflict.&nbsp;
<p>Therefore, the culture, identity and traditions of white America and
Western civilization cannot survive in any community or institution that
becomes multiracial or white-minority.&nbsp;
<p>Because of the greater attractiveness, prosperity and openness of white
Western societies, nonwhites will keep moving into them as long as they
can. Therefore white America can survive demographically and culturally
only if it recognizes itself as a threatened ethnoculture; if it ceases
or drastically reduces, on a national scale, all non-European immigration;
and if it assures, on a local scale, communities where its own institutions
may survive.
<p>The large and enduring differences in average intelligence between blacks
and whites mean, first, that blacks <i>on their own</i> can never be expected
to maintain a modern, democratic, civilized society; and second, that blacks
can never be expected to achieve collective economic equality and other
kinds of parity with whites. The forced attempt to achieve such collective
equality, through affirmative action and through endless attacks on white
racism as the supposed cause of existing inequalities, can only break down
all the institutions and standards of society and lead to race warfare.
<p>There are therefore only two sane options for black-white relations
in this country. Either blacks accept the above facts; accept a society
where white Western standards of law, behavior and intellectual life are
dominant and where advancement will be open for blacks only on an individual,
not a collective basis; accept their status as an ethnic minority and be
grateful to be living in a white society where they have goods and opportunities
undreamed of in a black society; or else, if blacks are not willing to
accept these things, then to avoid race warfare there must be peaceful
separation between the races.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>These propositions have nothing to do with any notions of race-hatred of
the other, or of race-worship of one&rsquo;s own. White people are just as sinful

ideologies such as Afrocentrism and Nazism, which are based on the deification
of one&rsquo;s own people and the demonization of others, this new politics is
based on a Christian recognition of our human limitations, namely that
we do not possess the godlike power to create a perfect world where everyone
is equal, and where differences don&rsquo;t matter. If there is any arrogance
to be seen today, it is in our current immigration and affirmative action
policies, which are among the greatest examples of hubris in the history
of the world.&nbsp;
<p>The irony is that whites are terrified that non-whites will hate them
and even start a race war if whites stand up for themselves, while the
truth is that many nonwhites will begin for the first time to respect whites.
Currently minorities don&rsquo;t respect whites because whites have defined themselves
ideologically as nothing while, in personal terms, they still try to protect
their self-interest. Whites thus seem both weak and hypocritical and therefore
despicable, and nonwhites just keep moving into the vacuum left by white
surrender. But when whites begin to assert their own civilizational and
racial identity and their desire to preserve it, not in a hateful way but
in a calm, intelligent and firm way, then nonwhites will begin to see whites,
not as the &ldquo;oppressors&rdquo; of left-liberal demonology, but as human beings
who have the same basic interests and concerns for their people and culture
that the minorities have for theirs.
<p>At bottom, all we are doing is making an appeal to justice. The injustice
and unacceptability of the current double standard will become obvious
to any person of good will once it is pointed out. And that is why the
principles I&rsquo;ve described need to be at the center of an anti-multiculturalist,
pro-Western civilization politics in this country. In my view, given current
demographic realities, any conservative politics that lacks these principles
cannot be a serious politics.
<p>In Deuteronomy, Chapter 28, God pronounces the curse that will fall
on the people of Israel if they fail to follow God&rsquo;s law:&nbsp;
<blockquote>&ldquo;Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people,
while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all the day; and
it shall not be in the power of your hand to prevent it. A nation which
you have not known shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your
labors; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually; so that
you shall be driven mad by the sight which your eyes shall see.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Unless America wakes up to the threat of demographic and cultural dispossession,
and finds the will to resist it, the curse pronounced in Deuteronomy awaits
us all.&nbsp;</p></font>

This speech was one of the first that I listened to.  It is one of the best I&rsquo;ve heard.  Mr.  Auster doesn&rsquo;t where the rose-tinted lenses that other so-called conservatives use to view the world.  With cold and precise logic, he lays out exactly what whites are up against.  I was vaguely aware of what whites were losing culturally as a result of their racial dispossession.  This lecture and now article makes it chillingly real.  </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The educational system has been systematically eliminating one after another of the &#8220;dead white males&#8221; that make up the history of Western civilization. The result is that a vacuum is being created for our youth, and the culture left for them is a &#8220;hip hop&#8221; culture of rappers which emulates and idolizes black cultural models. If you want to see the future which is coming, look at the white rapper, Eminen. So, as <span class="caps">T.S.</span> Eliot stated, &#8220;the cultural battle is the political battle at its deepest level,&#8221; and the battle unfortunately is being lost at this point of time. Let&rsquo;s hope that the tide will turn at some point in the future and that the white youth will realize what the older, Sixties generation of whites have been doing to them ever since that counter-culture took over in the United States and all of the Western world.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>Very, very true! My first hand experiences with blacks in particular, and to a lesser extent other non-whites, is they like you more if you are simply yourself, and not the expected groveling liberal white bootlicker. Most white liberals, are so obvious and stupid in their approach to non-whites, it is sickening. Has anyone else, been struck by the way white liberals fawn on blacks, but also in the same turn also treat them like backward children. At some level, any semi-intelligent black must see through this, and find themself disgusted with the white fool doing this to them.</p>
<p>Time and again, blacks have seemed almost surprised, by the fact that I hold them to the same standard as I would a white peer. That is, you do right by me and I&rsquo;ll reciprocate, start &#8220;acting the fool&#8221; and be treated as such. The effect is amazing, and also very funny when in any given extended social exchange, situation, or gathering, the white liberal freaks (who have the mind set that you are a &#8220;racist monster&#8221;) are given the cold shoulder by the blacks they wish patronizingly &#8220;worship&#8221; or emulate (e.g., with forced ebonics etc.) and readily seek out your company or advice. As with anything, there are going to exceptions to this rule (e.g., a dishonest black who wants to exploit white liberal stupidity, for personal gain.) but in general, I have found the above to be true. </p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>The theory of racial egalitarianism has been hegemonic for 50 years, that&rsquo;s it.  Even Karl Marx was a race realist and dismissed African intelligence.  None of the Founding Fathers nor even Lincoln were  racial egalitarians.  Most soldiers who fought for the North were not racial egalitarians.  The British Empire was not the product of racial egalitarianism.  It has only been since Brown in 1954 that the government has taken this position, so this period is an aberration.  And this is a paradigm that has  so many anamolies that it will soon have few supporters.  We must never think this in inevitable.  It is historical and can be changed.</p>
<p>The problem for this position is actually existing blacks and their intellectual failures and their criminal behaviors.  Virtually everyone who has contact with real black people comes to the same conclusion.  </p></font><p>Posted

<p>I have a suggestion.  Suppose the <span class="caps">A.R. </span>editors were to prepare several brief articles that could be printed on one sheet of paper each, and posted Acrobat files with the articles on this web site.  Then we activists could download the Acrobat files and print out as many copies of the articles as we like and leave them around as we go about our day   &mdash;   at the dentist&rsquo;s office, in a cart at the supermarket, etc.  The pieces would need to be visually polished and well-reasoned in the inimitable <span class="caps">A.R. </span>way so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be instantly dismissed as neo-Nazi propaganda.  Just reasonable pieces about securing our borders, filled with solid facts from respectable sources, with the <span class="caps">A.R. </span>web page address at the bottom so interested parties could find more information, like the archives of past <span class="caps">A.R. </span>issues.</p></font><p>Posted

<p>I doubt that AR is a nationalist web site.  I think of nationalist as idealist who want everyone to march by the same drum and crush those who disagree.  It seems AR is pragmatist, wanting to study and learn the truth about the issue and look for practical solutions.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Amren is white nationalist in so far as in they believe, as every healthy people have believed, that nation and race are fundamentally inseparable and that the dilution of the latter causes the destruction of the former.  </p>
<p>However, I do understand ones anxiety about potentially stigmatizing something with a phrase popularly held as pejorative and which, formerly, had no reason to exist.  In earlier times the views held by Amren and its proponents were natural and obvious and no &#8220;isms&#8221; were necessary for a normal sense of nationhood, however, in the lexicon of the day (the lexicon of our enemies) &#8220;white nationalism&#8221; seems the best phrase.<br>
    <br><br>
This brings us to one our great challenges: the problem of language.  I suggest we start referring to ourselves, and everyone who reads and agrees with Amren, as &#8220;Renaissance Men&#8221; (or women where it is applicable.)  This might be a good way of aligning ourselves with a notion and aspiration known to be good and healthy.  </p>
<p>Of course by doing so, we would first have to become &ldquo;Renaissance Men&rdquo; (excellent both mentally, physically and in terms of achievement) so as not to be ashamed to call ourselves such.  A worthwhile goal if ever there was one.   Perhaps those who had not yet achieved the standard could be referred to as &ldquo;Nascent&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aspiring&rdquo;.  I fit into this &ldquo;aspiring&rdquo; category.   What do others think?  Do we need a new lexicon? </p>

  <font size="3"><p>I think there is some confusion over nation, nationalism and ethnicity.</p>
<p>The nation is our government, the republic defined by our ability to elect people to represent us and run our government.</p>
<p>Nationalism is a behavior usually thought of as everyone marching to the same drum and not tolerating any disagreement.  Nationalism can exist in the <span class="caps">USA </span>but Americans are and have always been pragmatic and will not give up their individuality, so white nationalism won&rsquo;t get much real power against the powers that are anti-white.</p>
<p>Ethnicity can be one or many groups in the country, American Indian, Alaskin Native, African American, Hispanic, French, Scottish, Dane, German, Russian and many others.  Nearly all countries have ethnic groups and the <span class="caps">USA </span>has always had ethnic groups.</p>
<p>I think what we should call ourselves is &#8220;white ethnic groups&#8221; or &#8220;the white part of diversity&#8221; or &#8220;people of European Ancestry&#8221; or &#8220;European American&#8221; or &#8220;European-American or &#8220;white culture&#8221;.  AR uses the term &#8220;racial realists&#8221;.  Or maybe we can go by individual groups such as Irish, French, German, or other white ethnicity.  Us as a group of white voters can win votes if each white ethnic group and each individual still have their right to exist.  I think natinalism, religion, anti-religion and intolerance should be avoided because they threaten individual&rsquo;s right to exist, and it doesn&rsquo;t win many votes.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>government policy for the past 60 years is to promote non-white ethnicities, and in substle ways discriminate against white ethnicity.  Changes were made in immigration policy in the 1960&rsquo;s.  In the Welfare Reform Act on 1996 the decision was made for big business, government, schools and the mass media to give preferences for woman and [racial] minorities.  This is preferences beyond affirmative action  &mdash;  actually racial discrimination in favor of what is said to be a minority.  Few people seem to notice.  The destruction of white culture slowly continues because whites have not become aware, therefor haven&rsquo;t seen the need to do anything about it.<br>
