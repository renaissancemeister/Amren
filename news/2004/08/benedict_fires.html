<h1><a href="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/news/local/9459117.htm">Benedict Fires Professors Bucking Grade Policy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Sun News (Fla.), Aug. 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>COLUMBIA&mdash;Benedict College has fired two professors who refused to go along with a policy that says freshmen are awarded 60 percent of their grades based on effort and the rest on their work&rsquo;s academic quality.</p>
<p>Benedict President David Swinton says the Success Equals Effort policy gives struggling freshmen a chance to adapt to college academics.</p>
<p>He expects students to improve &mdash; the formula drops to 50-50 in the sophomore year and isn&rsquo;t used in the junior or senior year.</p>
<p>But he says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;interested in where they are at when they graduate, not where they are when they get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students &ldquo;have to get an A in effort to guarantee that if they fail the subject matter, they can get the minimum passing grade,&rdquo; Swinton said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a bad thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Science professors Milwood Motley and Larry Williams defied that policy and Swinton dismissed them. Neither had tenure, which could have protected them from firing.</p>
<p>Motley, a veteran five years at Benedict, said he didn&rsquo;t like concept from the beginning but went along with it grudgingly. Then he faced an academic dilemma of passing a student he thought had not learned course material. In his case, giving a C to a student with a high exam score of 40 percent was too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes a time when you have to say this is wrong,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Motley said he started in the Spring awarding grades strictly on academic performance. But the historically black college &ldquo;told us to go back and recalculate the grades, and I just refused to do it,&rdquo; he said. A letter in June, informed Motley and Williams they were fired. Williams would not comment to The State newspaper for its story on the situation.</p>
<p>A faculty grievance committee voted 4-3 vote to reinstate Motley, but Swinton overruled that, dismissing Motley&rsquo;s claim that his academic freedom had been violated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The record makes it abundantly clear that Dr. Motley has committed this infraction,&rdquo; Swinton wrote in a July 13 letter to the committee&rsquo;s chairwoman. &ldquo;Moreover, the transcript of the hearing reveals that he admits to refusing to comply with college policy and states that he would not comply if reinstated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professors &ldquo;were not dismissed because they did not follow the policy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were dismissed for insubordination. They were openly defiant and in some cases hostile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Founded in 1870 to educate freed slaves, the college has been a haven for students who must overcome barriers to obtain higher education. The school&rsquo;s open admissions policy means many students arrive with poor study habits and weak high school records, Swinton said.</p>
