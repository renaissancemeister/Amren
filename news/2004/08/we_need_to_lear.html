<p><font size="3"><p>Back in 1925, American society tended not to advise young white males about the consequences of intimacy with the black maid. Even if the 22-year-old Strom Thurmond considered himself a father, the standards of the time did not require him to give the daughter born of that intimacy any love, support or acceptance. He did, however, irretrievably give her his bloodline. </p>
<p>Essie Mae Washington-Williams, the offspring of Mr. Thurmond and his family&rsquo;s black maid, 16-year-old Carrie Butler, recently announced that she intended to join the Daughters of the American Revolution based on her Thurmond bloodline. Reared apart from her father, Ms. Washington-Williams did not have the same privileges as Mr. Thurmond&rsquo;s white children during his life, yet she is seeking the right to some of the privileges of her lineage. </p>
<p>She is not the first to do so. Ms. Washington-Williams said she was motivated by the battle of Lena Santos Ferguson to join a Washington chapter of the organization and by Ms. Ferguson&rsquo;s quest to honor black soldiers. Ms. Ferguson&rsquo;s grandmother, a black Virginia woman, had married a white man from Maine whose ancestor, Jonah Gay, was a patriot. In the 1980&rsquo;s, Ms. Ferguson fought a four-year legal battle for full membership and to enter her local chapter. It wasn&rsquo;t until the organization was faced with the potential loss of its tax-exempt status in Washington that she was permitted to join. </p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, Ms. Ferguson demanded, and received, a settlement agreement that bars discrimination and requires the D.A.R. to identify every African-American soldier who served in the Revolutionary War. It was important to Ms. Ferguson that black women know of their ancestors&rsquo; contribution to the founding of this nation and that they embrace it. </p>
<p>At the time of Ms. Ferguson&rsquo;s settlement, the D.A.R., as an organization, likely knew of many black soldiers who served in the Revolution, yet the organization was not open with the information nor was it receptive to black members. Ms. Ferguson&rsquo;s settlement required the D.A.R. to publish the names they had and to do research to identify more black soldiers, those who were somewhere, undiscovered, in historical records. </p>
<p>On this matter, the D.A.R.&rsquo;s behavior has been troubling. By early 2000, six years after the settlement agreement, the names of only 1,656 black patriots had been published in 11 D.A.R.-issued pamphlets. Yet some historians estimate 5,000 African-Americans served in the Revolutionary War. The organization&rsquo;s own genealogist, James Dent Walker, said estimates were &ldquo;deceptively low&rdquo; and that &ldquo;no one took the time to examine the records.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The settlement required the D.A.R. to do historical and genealogical research to find the names of black soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War. Yet, while doing this research, the D.A.R. has failed to use census records and other historical documents that could help identify the races of soldiers. It has also used a narrow classification system for race, one that increases the potential for underreporting: the D.A.R. includes only men described in historical records as &ldquo;black,&rdquo; &ldquo;Negro&rdquo; or &ldquo;mulatto,&rdquo; on their lists of black soldiers. However, whites of the period used a far greater range of colors to describe African-Americans. They meticulously recorded color distinctions among slaves: labels like &ldquo;brown,&rdquo; &ldquo;yellow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;copper&rdquo; (among others) were used consistently in advertisements for the return of runaways. Excluding those &ldquo;colored&rdquo; patriots puts them off-limits to prospective black D.A.R. members who might otherwise make the connection. </p>
<p>Yielding to pressure, in 2001, the D.A.R. published &ldquo;African-American and American Indian Patriots of the Revolutionary War.&rdquo; The number of names grew to 2400 names from 1,656, including an additional 744 previously assumed to be &ldquo;white.&rdquo; But there are still many more African-American soldiers to be identified, and while it acknowledges a handful of &ldquo;brown&rdquo; soldiers as black, as well as many &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; ones, the D.A.R. still holds to a narrow definition of an African-American. </p>
<p>This may give a clue to the D.A.R.&rsquo;s resistance: when confronted with 64 &ldquo;brown&rdquo; soldiers who could have sired members, the organization conceded that as many as 57 may be listed in its index of proven Revolutionary war soldiers (patriots whose descendants became D.A.R. members). Yet, for generations, descendants of &ldquo;brown&rdquo; patriots married &ldquo;light&rdquo; or &ldquo;white&rdquo; mates, thus increasing the chances that white society, including organizations like the D.A.R., would be a safe harbor for their offspring. When the lists are complete, many people whose families assimilated into white society and cloaked their African heritage may learn, for the first time, of their complicated ancestry. </p>
<p>And in the black community, many people are unaware of their Revolutionary War heritage or reluctant to embrace it &mdash; whether their ancestors were white or black. They may fear ostracism from other blacks who may view white ancestry as a source of shame and a reminder of the injustices and indignities of slavery. The Daughters of the American Revolution&rsquo;s efforts to hide the complicated realities of the past have fueled these types of feelings. But every American, regardless of color, must realize that the past is not pretty, linear, or easily explained. </p>

  <font size="3"><p>I was under the impression(from reading various articles and books) that the overwhelming majority of blacks who fought in the Revolutionay War fought for the British. Although used mostly as auxiliary troops because of their poor combat record, they were only sucessful (like Nat Turner) against unarmed White Women/Children and were led by pycho British Officers, such as  led the Indians in the infamous Wyoming and Cherry Valley Massacres. As I understand it, the number blacks who actually fought at some time or another for both sides were a total of 1200-1700 soldiers.</p></font><p>Posted

&ldquo;&hellip;every American, regardless of color, must realize that the past is not pretty, linear, or easily explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Really? When did blacks come to this conclusion? I thought everything was black and white.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that some blacks actually fought for the establishment of the most racist nation on earth and one that championed the slavery of Africans.</p>
<p>When all the facts come out for blacks, history all of a sudden is &ldquo;not pretty, linear, or easily explained&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Once again, blacks want it both ways. They use history to condemn Whites and history to forgive blacks. For Whites, history is stark facts. For blacks, it&rsquo;s shades of grey.</p>
<p>Same old story.</p>

  <font size="3"><p>Let the negroes research their own lineages, leave the <span class="caps">D.A.R. </span>and their funding alone! To Sissy White, yes, the majority of black soliders fought <span class="caps">AGAINST</span> America in the British Army, promised their freedom for their service. I sincerely hope that <span class="caps">D.A.R. </span>does not accept the descendents of British soliders, as this is an American organization seeking to protect American heritage. I really wish black people would realize that our history actually has much less to do with them than with us, that they are actually quite minor compared the the White man in American history. Black people reading this, may I point out a few items of interest:</p>
<p>-There were no blacks in the first or second Continental Congress.</p>
<p>-There were no black generals in the Revolution.</p>
<p>-There were no blacks at the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p>-The National Anthem was written by a White man. So were the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Pledge of Allegiance. Dixie, the anthem of the Confederacy, was written by a black man. Don&rsquo;t get so offended when we whistle it.</p>
<p>-Every President, thank God, has been a White man. So too every vice president, and until recently, every cabinet member.</p>
<p>I could go on, but in the interest of space I will simply remind blacks that the vast majority of what matters in this country&rsquo;s past was done by White people, and slavery was actually a minor blip on the radar compared to other things accomplished here. Get over yourselves.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>     No, Teutonicus, blacks cannot just &#8220;get over themselves&#8221; because if they did, they&rsquo;d have to behave like most whites.  They&rsquo;d have to settle down, behave themselves, live mostly quiet, unassuming lives, obey the law, educate themselves, go to a job everyday, save money, etc.  &mdash;  you get the idea. Just live a basic boring, uneventful life, yet somehow enjoyable to most people.  <br>
     And, then they&rsquo;d find out how really stupid and ineffectual and unnecessary they really are to America, and how most Americans just don&rsquo;t care to hear them whine about slavery.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>May I add that there were no white people opening doors, driving their own horses, building their own houses, picking their own cotton, making their own bricks, cooking their own food, growing their own vegetables, tending their own animals, wiping their own asses.  I hear that Washington invited a whole delegation of blacks to the Continental Congress. But they refused because they had to bring in the cotton that day.  They sent a message saying, &#8220;thank George, but we gotta finish up the laundry and the gardening.&#8221;  I understand they did send their proxy: &#8220;Please refer to us as &#8216;persons held in bondage&rsquo; and count us in the census and three-fourths a white person, so the white folks who run the plantations can have more votes in Congress than the Northerners who don&rsquo;t own slaves (persons held in bondage). </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Do you think what Mssrs. Barboza and Nash are saying is that a large percentage of white Americans with &#8220;blue&#8221; blood also have black blood.  That&rsquo;s quite astonishing, since those same people, if alive in 1776, would have been relegated to slavery, since all it took was one drop to condemn a &#8220;white&#8221; person to bondage.  I&rsquo;ve heard stats that suggest as many as 60 percent of white Americans have black blood.  Maybe you, and me, are black.  </p>

  <font size="3"><p>Sometimes the intelligence of humans as a whole worries me. America is approximately 70 percent white, still. I know, I know, you all have you&rsquo;re statistics saying 40 percent or some other outrageous number, but it&rsquo;s still 70 percent. And you&rsquo;re still worried about blacks? Let me whisper something in you&rsquo;re ear. Blacks are either a)dying jail b) killing each other off or c) being pulled from the back of pick up trucks in Jasper. No new blacks are flooding in America. You know who is though? Mexicans and hispanics. From across the border to across the Atlantic they come flowing in. The bad news is they have low <span class="caps">IQ, </span>just like blacks. The good news is at least they&rsquo;ll cut your damn yard for 10 bucks a month. Tequila anyone?</p></font><p>Posted
