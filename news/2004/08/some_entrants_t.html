<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of non-Mexican illegal border crossers 
  from more than 150 countries have been caught trying to get into the United 
  States this fiscal year, a federal report released by a Colorado congressman 
  shows. </p>
<p>The apprehension rates of illegal entrants the 
  Border Patrol classifies as Other Than Mexican (OTMs) include people from countries 
  the United States says sponsor terrorism. There were seven Iranians, five Syrians 
  and eight North Koreans. There were 122 people from Pakistan, a country of &#147;elevated 
  concern,&#148; according to the Department of Homeland Security. </p>
<p>About 41,700 non-Mexican illegal entrants were 
  apprehended along the Mexico and Canada borders from Oct. 1 to June 30, according 
  to data provided by Rep. Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who is a vocal 
  critic of immigration policy. </p>

              <p><strong>Entrant origins </strong></p>
              <p>The United States is concerned that 
                illegal entrants from some countries could pose an elevated security 
                risk. A new policy is making it easier for the Border Patrol to 
                immediately deport non-Mexican illegal entrants. The number of 
                people arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border between Oct. 1, 2003, 
                and June 30, 2004: </p>

                <strong>Largest totals </strong></p> <br>
                 The vast majority of illegal entrants apprehended 
                this year along the U.S.-Mexican border are Mexican nationals, 
                followed by people from Central and South America. Here are some 
                of the apprehension totals: </p> <br>
                &#9679; Brazil: 4,911 </p> <br>
                &#9679; Guatemala: 6,901 </p> <br>
                &#9679; Honduras: 14,906 </p> <br>
                &#9679; Mexico: 418,132 * </p> <br>
                Country source: Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
                Source of nationality of those apprehended: Office of Rep. Tom 
                Tancredo, R-Colo. * Arrests are from Oct. 1 to Aug. 11 for the 
                Tucson Sector only  </div>

<p>Of those OTM apprehensions, 132 people came from 
  countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified as representing 
  an &#147;elevated national-security concern&#148; since the Sept. 11 terror 
  attacks. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security does not make 
  its list of non-Mexican apprehensions broken down by nationality public, citing 
  national-security concerns. But the Border Patrol&rsquo;s Tucson sector says 
  it apprehended 6,140 non-Mexican entrants through Wednesday, said Rob Griffin, 
  an agency spokesman. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just more than 1 percent of the 418,000 
  Mexican nationals apprehended here since Oct. 1, the start of the agency&rsquo;s 
  fiscal year. </p>
<p>Tancredo said he released the more detailed accounting 
  of non-Mexican illegal entrants to strengthen his contention that foreign nationals 
  from countries that might pose a national-security risk are being attracted 
  to routes along the porous U.S. border that traditionally were used mostly by 
  Mexican nationals. </p>
<p>&#147;Thirty-five months past 9/11 and we&rsquo;re 
  just finding out about this?&#148; Tancredo said. &#147;How many hundreds of 
  thousands of people have come into the country illegally?&#148; </p>
<p>He concedes that some of the non-Mexican illegal 
  entrants are coming to the United States in search of a better life. But, he 
  says, others might have sinister intentions. </p>
<p>Border Patrol officials declined to comment on 
  Tancredo&rsquo;s report but say a new expanded authority will let Border Patrol 
  agents quickly remove non-Mexican illegal entrants. </p>
<p>Under the expedited removal process, scheduled 
  to begin in the Tucson sector in two weeks, illegal entrants not from Mexico 
  or Canada caught within 100 miles of the border who have been in the United 
  States less than 14 days will be sent home without having to first appear before 
  a judge. Illegal entrants deported under the new program would be flown home. 
  Immigration officials have said there is no estimate of how much the more frequent 
  flights will cost. </p>
<p>The new policy is designed to get those entrants 
  out of the country instead of having them released from custody to await a hearing. 
  In the past 16 months about 28,000 foreign nationals were released from custody 
  on the promise of returning for a hearing in immigration court. Ninety percent 
  did not come back. </p>
<p>Agents in the Tucson and Laredo, Texas, sectors 
  will have a two-day course in expedited removal next week, said Customs and 
  Border Protection spokesman Mario Villarreal. </p>
<p>Locally, there are high hopes the expedited removal 
  process will cut down on the number of non-Mexican entrants as well as number 
  of immigration detention cases that never make it to court, said Griffin, of 
  the Border Patrol. </p>
<p>A United Nations report coordinated with Homeland 
  Security showed Border Patrol agents running into problems when they instituted 
  a similar policy in the nation&rsquo;s airports last year. The U.N. found that 
  some agents did not understand asylum law and in some instances, physically 
  restrained people who were trying to plead for it. </p>
<p>The United Nations has requested a meeting with 
  Homeland Security officials to better gauge the training agents will receive 
  when the removal process begins between the ports of entry in Southern Arizona, 
  said Joung-ah Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N.&rsquo;s High Commissioner for 
  Refugees. </p>
