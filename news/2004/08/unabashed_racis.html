			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, USA Today</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An unabashed racist will represent the Republican party in the November election for a congressional seat after a write-in candidate failed to derail his effort. </p>
<p>With 86% of the primary vote counted Thursday, write-in candidate Dennis Bertrand had just 1,554 votes compared to 7,671, or 83%, for James L. Hart, a believer in the discredited, phony science of eugenics.</p>
<p>In November, the GOP candidate will oppose Rep. John Tanner, a Democrat who has represented the northwest Tennessee district for 15 years.</p>
<p>Hart, 60, vows if elected to work toward keeping &ldquo;less favored races&rdquo; from reproducing or immigrating to the United States. In campaign literature, Hart contends that &ldquo;poverty genes&rdquo; threaten to turn the United States into &ldquo;one big Detroit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to win,&rdquo; Hart said. &ldquo;I thought their network would beat my ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has run for the 8th District seat before and drawn little attention. But people began to notice this time because he was the only Republican on the ballot.</p>
<p>Since the deadline for getting on the ballot had passed, Bertrand, also a Republican, began a write-in campaign, saying he wanted to protect the party&rsquo;s honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think his beliefs are not beliefs of any party that I know of,&rdquo; Bertrand said Thursday night. &ldquo;I knew it was going to be a really long shot, but in good conscience, I had to at least give it an attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertrand, a financial analyst and former military officer, was on active duty with the National Guard when the deadline to get on the primary ballot passed.</p>
<p>Hart said he will have lots of time to campaign for the general election since he was forced Wednesday to resign from his job as a real estate salesman because of the attention he drew during the primary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;You&rsquo;re fired&rsquo; in exactly those words, but it was pretty clear what they wanted,&rdquo; Hart said.</p>
<p>While campaigning, Hart sometimes wears a protective vest and carries a .40-caliber pistol, but he said he has run into no trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I knock on a door and say white children deserve the same rights as everybody else, the enthusiastic response is truly amazing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>If a black person opens the door, he says he simply drops off campaign literature and leaves.</p>
