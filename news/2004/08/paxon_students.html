<h1>Paxon Students Arrested For Possible Hate Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>news4jax.com (Fla.), Aug. 27</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. &mdash; Police are investigating what they call a hate crime involving students at Paxon Middle School on Friday. </p>
<p>According to detectives, six black students attacked three white students during gym class while shouting racial slurs at them. </p>
<p>Now, parents want to know who was supposed to be watching the students when the fight broke out. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My son got pushed and some other kids started beating him punching him everywhere, kicking him everywhere,&rdquo; said one mother, who did not want to be identified. </p>
<p>She said she was outraged to discover her 11-year-old son and two other boys were beaten during their fourth-period gym class. Police said the attack was racially motivated. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My son is even afraid to go to the bathroom &mdash; sometimes he gets hit in the bathroom,&rdquo; the mother explained. </p>
<p>She said a black boy said it&rsquo;s &ldquo;white cracker season.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Among the six boys arrested in the incident was a 14-year-old, who said the three white teens instigated the fight. The boys who were arrested were also suspended from school. </p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the white boys &hellip; was like, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s white cracker day. It&rsquo;s white cracker day.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s when my friends started hitting them,&rdquo; said the 14-year-old. </p>
<p>But the police report indicated that several black male students said, &ldquo;This is white cracker season&rdquo; before they began pushing, hitting and kicking several white male students. </p>
<p>The mother of one of the suspects said she never raised her child to be racist. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They just said that it&rsquo;s a racist thing, and I&rsquo;m not racist and my son is not racist,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>But the State Attorney&rsquo;s Office is considering charges of hate crimes, which elevates what would have been a first-degree misdemeanor to a felony. </p>
<p>&ldquo;With the racial undertones, the race-crime aggravator was used, and that would make it a third-degree felony,&rdquo; explained State Attorney spokesman Jay Plotkin. </p>
<p>Paxon Principal Pam Pierce said she&rsquo;s continuing to do everything possible to protect her students, but one victim&rsquo;s mother is still worried. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just afraid for my son to go back to school, you know. I&rsquo;m afraid that their friends will try and beat him up,&rdquo; she said.</p>
