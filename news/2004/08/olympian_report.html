<h1>Olympian Reports PC Has Reached Rowing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Frackleton (U.S. quadruple sculls team, 1988), Vdare.com, Aug. 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I retired from competition after the 1988 Olympics. But I was vaguely aware that they&rsquo;ve tightened things up quite a bit since I quit racing, and that nowadays, just because you make your national team, it&rsquo;s no longer a guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be competing in the Olympics. Even back in the eighties, the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/common/search/asp/match.asp?query=IOC&amp;source=queryBox&amp;origin=0&amp;lang=en&amp;acces=Direct+access">International Olympic Committee</a> [IOC] was rattling its <a href="http://www.fencingfootage.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=76">sabre</a>. Understand that it wasn&rsquo;t happy, given that rowing garnered the second highest medal count at the Olympics, right behind track and field.</p>
<p>I sort of counted my blessings, realizing that in today&rsquo;s game, my boat, the American quadruple sculls, likely would not have been given the nod to compete in the Games.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until just a few days ago, when I came across an article in<i> </i><a href="http://www.rowingnews.com/"><i>Rowing News</i></a>, that I began to see red. The behind-the-scenes deal making goes like this: FISA, in an effort to assuage the IOC, is on a PR mission to make <a href="http://www.isteve.com/Web%20Exclusives%20Archive-Sep2003.htm#37879.9373918982">rowing</a>, a very European (ahem: white) sport, appear more widely embraced on the world stage than it is. Hence the Asian, African, and Latin American <b>&#147;Continental Qualifying Regattas,&#148;</b><b> </b>wherein sixteen out of the allotted thirty slots for the men&rsquo;s single scull are awarded to second&mdash;or, more often than not&mdash;third-rate scullers. [<i>Underdeveloped: Globalizing the Games</i><i>, September, 2004, &#147;The Growth is impressive, even if the rowing isn&rsquo;t&#148;</i>]</p>
<p>How did we ever come to this? Should we <a href="/">thank</a> the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106611/quotes">Jamaican bobsledders</a>, a ski jumper named Eddie &#147;the Eagle&#148; Edwards, or, more recently, Eric Moussambani of Equatorial Guinea, who, four years ago, competed (I&rsquo;m being generous here) in the hundred-meter freestyle? </p>
<p>Remember it? Moussambani&rsquo;s only competitors in the opening heat had both been disqualified for false starts, leaving Moussambani to race alone, against the clock. At Sydney&rsquo;s sold-out natatorium, the crowd first scratched its head at the sight of a swimmer who could barely swim, next laughed out loud when a bona fide Olympian began doing the doggy-paddle, and then held its breath, wondering whether or not this newcomer would finish the race <a href="http://espn.go.com/oly/summer00/swimming/s/2000/0920/760807.html">or drown. </a></p>
<p>But finish he did&mdash;more than a minute behind the heat winners&mdash;and no one seemed to mind. The crowd was on its feet, cheering wildly for a different sort of Olympic hero, a David, if you will, who had the guts to face the giants of the sport, all in front of a worldwide audience. </p>
<p>At that moment, I&rsquo;d wager that millions upon millions of people around the world were wiping their eyes. I know&mdash;I was one of them. </p>
<p>But while Mr. Moussambani&rsquo;s personal triumph ought not to be dismissed, the question begs to be asked:<i> What</i> was<i> a man who </i><i>could barely swim</i><i> doing at the Olympics, going up against the world&rsquo;s best, when literally a billion people from around the world would likely have bested him in the event?</p>
</i>
<p>Many a time it&rsquo;s been said that making it to the Olympics isn&rsquo;t just about winning&mdash;it&rsquo;s about the getting there. But in this, the twenty-eighth modern Olympiad, just exactly where is it that we&rsquo;ve arrived? Is it okay with everyone that a Russian or American man&mdash;both of whom might have been two or three lengths back, in fifteenth or sixteenth place, say&mdash;will be sitting at home, watching TV, as a man from Tunisia flounders about in his shell, some twenty lengths behind, placing twenty-seventh out of thirty in a watered-down field?</p>
<p>Me, I got no problem with the whole thing, about manufacturing Kodak moments to help promote <b>&#147;the human element inherent in sport.&#148;</b> </p>
<p>As long as, that is, they reserve lane one in the 100-meter track finals for George Costanza from<i> Seinfeld</i>. </p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re at it, we probably ought to reserve lane eight for William Hung of<i> American Idol</i> <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1091484609400&amp;call_pageid=968867495754&amp;col=969483191630">fame</a>. Doubt if the dude can run, but man&mdash;oh, man&mdash;he definitely bangs.</p>
