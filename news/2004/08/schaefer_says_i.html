<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/metro/20040812-125344-4174r.htm">Schaefer Says Illegals Drain Health System</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Redding Jr., Washington Times, Aug. 12</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Maryland Comptroller William Donald Schaefer said yesterday that illegal aliens drain health care resources &mdash; his second recent criticism about immigration. </p>
<p>During a Board of Public Works meeting in Annapolis, Mr. Schaefer asked state health Secretary Nelson J. Sabatini how much the state spends on health care for illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>When told that the figure is about $40 million, Mr. Schaefer said: &ldquo;Our own people, that is legitimate Americans, cannot get health care.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He added that it would be a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; if the country becomes bilingual &mdash; English and Spanish speaking. </p>
<p>Mr. Schaefer said he supports legal immigration but complained that some people who are not citizens do not have &ldquo;green cards&rdquo; &mdash; which permit permanent residency &mdash; and will not ask for one. </p>
<p>After an encounter in May with a McDonald&rsquo;s employee who had trouble understanding his order, Mr. Schaefer complained that foreigners are not learning to &ldquo;speak the language.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The 82-year-old former governor was criticized for his comments, including the statement that non-English speaking residents should become &ldquo;Americanized.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Delegate Victor R. Ramirez, a Prince George&rsquo;s Democrat, called Mr. Schaefer&rsquo;s comments &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;I respect him as a politician, but I think the statements were way out of line.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Roberto Allen, president of the Baltimore Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, agreed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It just seems like it&rsquo;s a counterproductive kind of commentary,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, was the among the first to defend Mr. Schaefer, his political ally. </p>
<p>He said immigrants should assimilate into the U.S. culture and that multiculturalism was &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; and &ldquo;crap.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Ehrlich apologized for using the word crap but said bunk was a benign term. </p>
<p>Luis Borunda, chairman of the Hispanic Republicans of Maryland, the official outreach arm for the party, said Mr. Ehrlich expressed &ldquo;what needed to be said.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Ramirez said yesterday that he was not surprised by Mr. Schaefer&rsquo;s most recent comments. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is free to speak his mind,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Still, Mr. Schaefer should remember that the American lexicon has for hundreds of years included terms of Spanish origin, including the words Arizona, Colorado and Nevada, Mr. Ramirez said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had two languages that have been spoken in this country for a long time,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>He declined to comment on the $40 million expenditure because he did not know whether the number was accurate. </p>
<p>The amount the state spends on health care for illegal aliens could be closer to $100 million, said Delegate Pat McDonough, Baltimore County Republican. </p>
<p>Mr. McDonough was unsuccessful in passing a bill during the 2004 General Assembly that called for a study to learn exactly how much illegal aliens are costing the state in health care. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We the citizens of Maryland are subsidizing illegal aliens&rsquo; health care costs when many of our own people cannot afford health care for themselves,&rdquo; Mr. McDonough said yesterday. &ldquo;In other words, we are rewarding law breakers and punishing law-abiding citizens.&rdquo;</p>
