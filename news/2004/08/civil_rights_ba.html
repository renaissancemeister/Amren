<div align="left"><i>Shaila K. Dewan, New York Times, Aug. 10</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>ATLANTA &mdash; One of the great peculiarities of the South is the exhaustive celebration of its own defeat. Equestrian statues, battle flags and stolid historical markers commemorate seemingly every shot fired in the Civil War. </p>
<p>Now, the victories of another war &mdash; against white supremacy, Jim Crow and lynchings &mdash; are starting to get equal billing.</p>
<p>A surge of interest in the civil rights movement has dislodged lingering discomfort with the past, bringing new attention to the lunch counters, bus terminals and churches that were the movement&rsquo;s battlegrounds. Suddenly, events both major and minor are being memorialized; the projects under way range from full-blown tourist attractions to an attempt to name a Georgia highway for a black G.I. killed by Klansmen. </p>
<p>In Greensboro, N.C., the Woolworth where the sit-in movement began will become a museum. In Mississippi, Neshoba County published a civil rights tour guide this summer showing the site where three civil rights workers were killed 40 years ago. In Alabama, the National Park Service will break ground in March on the first of three visitor centers along the route of the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march.</p>
<p>It has not been easy for communities to embrace a past laced with shame and violence. &ldquo;Tourism has been forced on these places,&rdquo; said Jim Carrier, a writer from Montgomery, Ala., whose &ldquo;Traveler&rsquo;s Guide to the Civil Rights Movement&rdquo; was published by Harcourt in January. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like they put out a sign one day and said, &lsquo;Come on down and see our civil rights history.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s in response to people coming down here, lugging big history books, looking for these places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lure of tourism money has helped overcome the shame. More urgently, the approach of benchmark anniversaries, like the 40th birthday of the voting rights march next spring, has guaranteed a re-examination of the past, whether locals like it or not. Furthermore, economic development officials have begun to preach that acknowledging the past is necessary to show the world that things have changed. </p>
<p>Still, the response has been gradual. Until 1993, there was not so much as a sign marking the bus stop in Montgomery where Rosa Parks was arrested. The organizers of the new memorials and museums say that they are the fruit of a shift in attitude, as the first generation of people raised in an integrated society has matured, and resistance to the changes wrought in the 60&rsquo;s has eroded. At the same time, black political power has grown, influencing how history is publicly recounted.</p>
<p>In Alabama, even towns with no more than a tenuous connection to the movement have asked to be included on a new state civil rights trail, said Lee Sentell, the state tourism director. &ldquo;People want to have their contribution to civil rights progress connected with their hometown,&rdquo; Mr. Sentell said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a change. People are seeing this as more mainstream than people have in the past.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Part of that, he said, is because of the success of the first major civil rights museums, in Birmingham and Memphis, each about a dozen years old. Each attracts about 150,000 people a year. The Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta is one of the South&rsquo;s most popular tourist attractions, with more than 650,000 visitors last year.</p>
<p>Their popularity has shown that the history of the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s is a valuable commodity. &ldquo;There are so many desperately poor communities and a lot of what they have going for them is their civil rights history,&rdquo; said Susan Glisson, director of the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.</p>
<p>Yet resistance persists, particularly among whites who see no reason to dredge up the painful past or who fear that the motive is to assign blame. </p>
<p>In Greensboro, the Woolworth where four black college freshmen dared to sit at the whites-only lunch counter on Feb. 1, 1960, was to be replaced by a parking garage before it was bought by two local black politicians, Earl Young and Skip Alston, a decade ago. They announced plans to turn it into a museum. </p>
<p>In 1999, a bond referendum that would have given the project $3 million failed by a narrow margin. The vote split on racial lines, said McArthur Davis, a stockbroker who until recently was the project&rsquo;s executive director, with 85 percent of blacks in favor and 75 percent of whites against. That year a headless skunk was hung on the Woolworth&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>But the project gained momentum. At presentations to white audiences, Mr. Davis would tell the story of three white women who took seats, then told the waitress to serve the blacks first. &ldquo;When you told that story, and the only story they&rsquo;ve ever heard was about the four black guys, they said, &lsquo;Hey, we did something too,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Davis said. Then he added, &ldquo;I would also tell blacks that, because many of them didn&rsquo;t know either.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The students&rsquo; former school, the North Carolina A&T; State University, embraced the project in 2001, lending its vice chancellor for development to help raise money. American Express gave $500,000. And Action Greensboro, the city&rsquo;s downtown development group, pledged $4 million. The museum expects to attract at least 100,000 visitors to Greensboro yearly and create more than 300 jobs. Last month, the legislature allotted $1.5 million for the project.</p>
<p>Inside the Woolworth, the terrazzo floor is finally emerging from layers of grime. The stainless steel behind the lunch counter gleams as if the last hot dog was sold yesterday. Called the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, it is scheduled to open in 2005, the 45th anniversary of the sit-in.</p>
<p>Franklin McCain, one of the four students who began the sit-in, thought people had forgotten what happened until the museum plan emerged. All the hurdles over the years were a bit painful, said Mr. McCain, who is 63 and lives in Charlotte, N.C. &ldquo;I saw it as a just kind of growing pain, or a situation where no one actually knew the way, and they were plowing new ground,&rdquo; Mr. McCain said. </p>
<p>In other places, examinations of the not-so-distant past have occasioned long bouts of municipal soul-searching. Many residents of Neshoba County, Miss., believe justice was never served in the case of the three civil rights workers who were killed and buried with a bulldozer. </p>
<p>The state did not prosecute anyone for the deaths, yet it was the state Development Authority that first suggested to the predominantly white tourism board that the event warranted public acknowledgement; for years, inquiring tourists received only a handmade flier with directions to the Mount Zion Church, which holds an annual memorial service for the three men.</p>
<p>Some blacks were initially skeptical of the county&rsquo;s motives, but eventually a multiracial group was formed to research the history and create a tour guide, wrestling with such delicate matters as whether to name the sheriff who arrested the three workers. He is dead, but his son still lives in the community. In the end, the sheriff was not named. &ldquo;You have to balance being honest and being respectful of someone whose fault it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr. Glisson, who was called in to mediate.</p>
<p>David Vowell, the president of the Community Development Partnership, said he was nervous when the process began. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t apprehensive about whether or not we were doing the right thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We just supposed that there were people out there that wouldn&rsquo;t be receptive to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, he said, the guide was a big success. But things did not end there; its publication was accompanied by a &ldquo;call for justice&rdquo; on the 40th anniversary of the deaths. The state has since asked the federal government for help investigating the killings.</p>
<p>In some communities, history is in danger of disappearing altogether. In Madison County, Ga., a white woman named Dena Chandler was haunted by a story she remembered from childhood, of a black veteran and Army reservist named Lemuel Penn who was killed by Klansmen on his way home from Fort Benning on July 11, 1964. The suspects were acquitted by an all-white jury.</p>
<p>When Ms. Chandler looked for more information, she found that a book about the case had been repeatedly stolen from local libraries. &ldquo;A lot of people had forgotten about Lemuel Penn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And a lot of the younger people &mdash; and this is what really disturbed me &mdash; had never heard of him. That death shaped their world in ways that they don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t understand unless they know about it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Together with a black preacher and his wife, Ms. Chandler organized a gospel concert that raised enough money for a historical marker. The group is also trying to have Highway 172 renamed in Colonel Penn&rsquo;s honor. </p>
<p>Although many preservation efforts have been led by multiracial groups, some blacks fear that whites will reap most of the profits. Neatly packaging the past can give the false impression that racism is over, some say of the efforts.</p>
<p>Mississippi officials &ldquo;are trying to use our history to cover up their sins,&rdquo; said Curtis Muhammad, a former member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. &ldquo;Not just their past sins, but their present sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some say the interest in civil rights is simply an outgrowth of the burgeoning heritage tourism industry. Frances Smiley, who put together the first black heritage guide to Alabama more than two decades ago and still works for the state tourism bureau, sees some truth in that. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had people want to do Civil War and civil rights together,&rdquo; Ms. Smiley said. &ldquo;And I never imagined that happening.&rdquo;</p></font>

  <font size="3"><p>When whites are in charge in a society that has both blacks and whites, and the leaders accept the fact that the two peoples differ greatly in abilities, temperment, and culture, they very sensibly allow and even enforce separation of the races.  And that society prospers and both people are happier (yes, blacks in the US were happier back then, when they enjoyed such bygone things as low illegitimacy rates and low crime rates).  But when such a society ignores the differences between the two races, starts putting blacks in charge, pretends the races are equal and forces them together, envy, strife and discontentment abound on both sides.  And black crime rates skyrocket.</p>
<p>To think about it another way, when whites are fully in charge of a country, they make blacks endure such horrors as sitting at different lunch counters, going to different schools, and drinking from different water fountains.  When blacks are in charge of a country, they systematically steal all of the whites&rsquo; land, and begin the process of raping, beheading and murdering all of them.  And then they are left with the famine and squalor that always result.  Haiti&rsquo;s transformation is complete.  Zimbabwe is most of the way there, and South Africa is doing its best to catch up.  We would do well to pay more attention to what has happened and is happening in those countries.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>I think it is very amusing that some black crook is trying to sell on <span class="caps">EBAY </span>the bathtub James Earl Ray was standing in when he shot <span class="caps">M.L.K.. </span> Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it isn&rsquo;t even the same tub.</p>
<p>When belittling the Southerners and their Civil War monuments, it is obvious that the obviously black author Shaila Dewan has absolutely no sense of proportionality.  How many southerners died during the Civil War?  And how many blacks died during the civil rights struggle?  </p>
<p>Also, it hasn&rsquo;t even dawned on these idiotic perpetual complainers that when the Mexican reconquista is finally complete in the South, Mexicans won&rsquo;t give a hoot about blacks or whites and any grievances between them.  The Mex&rsquo;s will simply tear down the civil right&rsquo;s memorials and erect statues of Ceaser Chavez.  When that happens, blacks will beg for the good ole days when they could blame whitey for all their problems and someone actually listened.  In fact, on a national level, this is already somewhat happening. Witness Jorge Bushez.   </p></font><p>Posted
