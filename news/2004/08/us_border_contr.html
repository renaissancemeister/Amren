<h1>U.S. Border Control on Social Security Totalization</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>U.S. Border Control, U.S. Newswire, Aug. 17</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Edward I. Nelson, chairman of U.S. Border Control, told the Congress they are &ldquo;guilty of either cowardice or complicity with regard to the Bush Administration&rsquo;s plan to buy the Hispanic vote with America&rsquo;s Social Security Trust Fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last September,&rdquo; Nelson reminded them, &ldquo;when we provided testimony to the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Claims, you were put on notice that the President was seriously considering signing a pact with Mexico that would give any Mexican who had worked in the U.S., including illegal aliens, full U.S. Social Security benefits, paid out of the Social Security Trust &hellip;  and you did nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelson continued, &ldquo;And today, when there is less than 30 days to repeal this outrageous treaty that virtually guarantees the bankruptcy of America&rsquo;s Social Security Trust Fund, you continue to do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to all the promises you made to your constituents? How many times have you sworn to protect our Social Security system? How do you think your constituents will react when they learn that you stood by and did nothing to protect our nation&rsquo;s primary retirement system and left millions of Americans at risk of financial disaster?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you how they will react. If they have any sense at all, they will throw you out of office,&rdquo; said Nelson who pointed out that &ldquo;with most retired Americans already finding it difficult to make ends meet due to low interest rates on their savings, this is the worst possible time to be squandering this crucial safety net that can mean the difference between life and death for some of our neighbors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelson reminded them that the treaty actually gives Social Security benefits to Mexicans faster and easier than Americans can get them. Americans are required to work a minimum of 40 quarters or 10 years to collect Social Security. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This treaty would allow Mexicans who have not met that minimum to include their alleged work experience in Mexico toward getting our Social Security! In fact,&rdquo; Nelson continued, &ldquo;the reality is that any Mexican need only get across the border for a short time in order to qualify for a lavish retirement paid out of the Trust Fund that was supposed to be safeguarded for American retirees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelson urged every Representative to cosponsor and vote for H.Res.720 immediately. This resolution, sponsored by Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.), allows the Congress, under section 233(e)(2) of the Social Security Act, to disapprove the treaty. Unlike other forms of treaty which have to be ratified by the Senate, this treaty becomes effective 60 days after it is presented to the Congress, unless it takes specific action to disapprove it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, the timing for repealing the treaty couldn&rsquo;t be worse. The President signed it knowing that the Congress is trying to recess and most Repesentatives have their hands full with their reelection campaigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>U.S. Border Control is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization, established in 1986, that is dedicated to education of the public on issues related to the protection of the sovereignty of the United States, including the establishment and maintenance of effective border integrity systems, economic policies, national defense practices, and immigration policies focusing on ending illegal immigration by securing the nation&rsquo;s borders and reforming the border and immigration policies.</p>
