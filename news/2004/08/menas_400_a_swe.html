<h1>Men&rsquo;s 400 A Sweep For The U.S.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Rosen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Aug. 23</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><span class="caps">ATHENS,</span> Greece &mdash; As Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Born in the <span class="caps">USA</span>&rdquo; blared over the Olympic Stadium loudspeaker Monday night, three athletes in red, white and blue began a slow victory lap.</p>
<p>Moments earlier, they had covered the distance considerably faster while running into the record book: Jeremy Wariner, Otis Harris and Derrick Brew gave the United States a 400-meter-dash sweep for the fourth time in Olympic history and the first since 1988.</p>
<p>They also saw three American flags raised together for the first time in the Athens Games, jump-started the medal count for the struggling <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Olympic track-and-field team and gave a positive spin to the 400 meters, an event that has been tainted by doping scandals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have actually restored dignity to the 400 meters,&rdquo; said Michael Johnson, who still holds the world record of 43.18 seconds. &ldquo;These guys have brought it back in great style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wariner, a 20-year-old from Grand Prairie, Texas, has a style that includes sunglasses &mdash; day or night &mdash; and diamond stud earrings.</p>
<p>With a time of 44 seconds flat, he became the sixth straight American to win the 400 meters and won the 18th <span class="caps">U.S. </span>gold medal for that event in the 25 Olympic Games since 1896. Wariner followed a trail blazed by Johnson, a fellow Baylor University Bear who won in 1996 and 2000.</p>
<p>When Wariner came off the track, the first thing he told Clyde Hart, who had also coached Johnson, was &ldquo;I broke the school record.&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s time of 44.21 seconds had stood at Baylor since 1990.</p>
<p>Hart told Wariner that he had to surrender his left shoe, just as Johnson did when he won the Olympics.</p>
<p>Wariner&rsquo;s time was the eighth-best performance of all time. Had he ever had a bigger moment in his life?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides being born, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Harris&rsquo; time of 44.16 seconds was a personal best, while Brew, 26, had a season-best of 44.42.</p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/wariner.JPG" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> The three Americans will join forces for the 1,600-meter relay Saturday. The United States has not lost a 1,600-meter relay final it has entered since 1956.</p>
<p>The trio had discussed a sweep in the days leading up to the 400-meter race. They just didn&rsquo;t know what the order would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was definitely my goal to win a gold medal,&rdquo; said Harris, 22, &ldquo;but if anybody was going to beat me, I&rsquo;m glad it was one of my teammates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The homestretch became a duel between Wariner and Harris, who had led for most of the race. When Wariner crossed the finish line first, he raised his arms in victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fastest white guy I&rsquo;ve ever seen run,&rdquo; said Alleyne Francique of Grenada, who finished fourth.</p>
<p>Wariner is the first white American to win the Olympic gold medal in the 400 since Mike Larrabee in 1964.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what race, gender or ethnicity you are; it&rsquo;s your ability,&rdquo; said Wariner. He said he has heard the issue raised so many times that he&rsquo;s lost count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Athletes are athletes,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;Obviously, we&rsquo;re different because of cultural and racial difference and physiological makeup&hellip; It&rsquo;s been a question for ages. So there&rsquo;s no reason for us to now start trying to use Jeremy as a lab rat and figure it out with him. It is what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Americans&rsquo; victory celebration was as restrained as the United States team had been at the opening ceremony, although they did wave <span class="caps">U.S. </span>flags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want to do anything to disrespect our country,&rdquo; Harris said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew deep down that we&rsquo;re excited, and just the expressions on our faces were all we needed to show,&rdquo; Wariner said.</p>
