<div align="left"><i>Rachel L. Swarns, New York Times, Aug. 10</i></p></font>
<p><font size="3"><p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 &mdash; Citing concerns about terrorists crossing the nation&rsquo;s land borders, the Department of Homeland Security announced today that it planned to give border patrol agents sweeping new powers to deport illegal aliens from the frontiers abutting Mexico and Canada without providing the aliens the opportunity to make their case before an immigration judge.</p>
<p>The move, which will take effect this month, represents a broad expansion of the authority of the thousands of law enforcement agents who currently patrol the nation&rsquo;s borders. Until now, border patrol agents typically delivered undocumented immigrants to the custody of the immigration courts, where judges determined whether they should be deported or remain in the United States.</p>
<p>Homeland Security officials described the immigration courts &mdash; which hear pleas for asylum and other appeals to remain in the country &mdash; as sluggish and cumbersome, saying illegal immigrants often wait more than a year before being deported, straining the capacity of detention centers and draining critical resources. Under the new system, immigrants will typically be deported within eight days of their apprehension, officials said.</p>
<p>Immigration legislation passed in 1996 allows the immigration service to deport certain groups of illegal aliens without judicial oversight, but until now the agency only permitted officials at the nation&rsquo;s airports and seaports to do so. The new rule will apply to illegal aliens caught within 100 miles of the Mexican and Canadian borders who have spent 14 days or less within the United States. The border agents will focus on deporting third-country nationals, rather than Mexicans or Canadians, and they are expected to begin exercising their new powers on Aug. 24 in Tucson and Laredo, Tex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a concern that as we tighten the security of our ports of entry through our biometric checks that there will be more opportunity or more effort made by terrorists to enter our country through our vast land borders,&rdquo; Asa Hutchinson, the undersecretary for border security at the Department of Homeland Security, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognize that we have to secure those and that&rsquo;s the president&rsquo;s first principle of immigration reform,&rdquo; Mr. Hutchinson said. &ldquo;America must secure its borders and this is a part of that effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision was hailed by officials who have long complained that the nation&rsquo;s porous borders represent a serious threat to national security. But it prompted a flurry of criticism from advocates for immigrants who warned that the new system lacked adequate safeguards to ensure that people fleeing persecution, American citizens lacking paperwork or other travelers with legitimate grounds would not be improperly deported.</p>
<p>Mr. Hutchinson said that border agents would be trained on asylum law and that immigrants who demonstrated a credible fear of persecution would be sent to see immigrant judges, not returned to hostile governments. &ldquo;That right,&rdquo; he said of the right to apply for asylum, &ldquo;is very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Homeland Security officials provided little details about the training, and advocates said that they feared that mistakes would be made when border agents decide who will be deported and who will not, often in the vast, inhospitable plains of the southern deserts.</p></font>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this profiling?  </p>
<p>Imaginary border patroler: &#8216;Oh, I see that you are a Mexican, so I won&rsquo;t arrest you, however, the guy across the street over there is Arab, so he will be arrested&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>If someone is an illegal alien, they should be arrested no matter where they came from, end of story.  Why do we always have to waste our time walking on egg shells trying to please the Mexicans?  This is becoming ridiculous!  Let&rsquo;s just put our foot down and arrest anybody and everybody that is illegal, whether they are Ethiopian, English, Egyptian or Ecuadorian.  Then that way no one will have anything to complain about.  </p>
<p>I think the Dutch have the right thing going on right now.  If America becomes Mexico, I might just immigrate to Holland, (that is if they let me in, God Bless them).</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>This may be overly optimistic   &mdash;   but just maybe Dubya is getting the message that there are a lot of rightists out there   &mdash;   many former supporters   &mdash;   who are steamed up enough about his kowtowing to the left on immigration issues to stay home on Nov. 2.</p>
<p>Notice that his advisors obviously feel that he needs to be PC and frame the action as motivated simply by terrorism concerns.  God forbid he point out that illegal Mexican immigrants are committing crimes at a horrifying rate and taxing the Southwest&rsquo;s water resources to an alarming degree, among other contributions.  But if the result is positive, I&rsquo;m pleased.  Now   &mdash;   and I&rsquo;m much more skeptical about this   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s see if this is actually put into action.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>There are plenty of reports of third-country folks getting matricular consulars which state that they are Mexican Nationals. I&rsquo;m sure al Qaeda is up to getting these documents; and other such documents testifying that they are of Mexican ancestry. </p>
<p>In that case, only profiling will do so that these folks documents can be further investigated to determine their true nationality. If profiling is illegal, then every illegal must be returned.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>We definitely need to close the borders and stop nonwhite immigration cold or else America will lose its identity. This identity which many brainwashed people find hard to take is white, European and Christian.  These brainwashed have been so filled with egalitarian propaganda that it is very hard for them to make any distinctions at all between ethnic groups, cultural groups or religions or even classes.   I think there is nothing wrong at all with wanting America to be restored to its natural white self.</p></font><p>Posted

  <font size="3"><p>   Well, it is much deeper than race. This isnt about <span class="caps">RACE.</span> We embrace races. This is about respecting our laws, our people, our traditions. We would not go to Mexico and force them to try to accomidate the 4th of July, show blatant disregard for their laws, or customs. Why must anything that America is or was be denounced to be politically correct? I would like to see immigrants taken much further to gain citizenship. I would require them to take and pass the US Constituition. Just like we must. They should know our history before they make their stolen home here. Legal immigrants have become lumped in with illegals. They are taking all immigrants down with them. <br>
 We are chock full of immigrants, so much that MY <span class="caps">AMERICAN </span>sons will have no work when they are old enough. They should never have to compete with illegals who entice with low wages. <br><br>
 Kill the plant at the root, punish severly those who hire them. If it means shutting them down, then so be it. Regard and obey the law then, and you will have no problems. </p></font><p>Posted
