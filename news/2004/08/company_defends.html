<h1>Company Defends Itself Over Toy Resembling 9-11 Attacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WFTV.com (Fla.), Aug. 27</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><span class="caps">ORLANDO,</span> Fla. &mdash; Channel 9 prompted some quick action after we found a children&rsquo;s toy that had a plane between two towers. Lisy Corporation officials are defending their company and say they feel they were tricked into putting the toy in their candy bags. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how the little toy could make it into the hands of children. It shows a jetliner flying into a set of Twin Towers. </p>
<p>Moises Soto is just 11 years old, but he doesn&rsquo;t need school to know right from wrong and good toys from bad. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked like a plane crashing into the Twin Towers,&rdquo; he says. </p>
<p>Moises knew immediately what this toy was all about when he saw his 2-year-old nephew, Isa, playing with it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not appropriate. It was a tragedy that happened and it&rsquo;s not good to have a toy like that,&rdquo; Moises says. </p>
<p>The toys are packaged with candy sold at Hispanic groceries. They were distributed as far away as Boston. </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/911toy.gif" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> The company that sold them, but now has recalled them, is called Lisy Corporation, a Miami-based spice, snack and candy company. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave our people, immediately, the authority to get it from the stores and to send it back,&rdquo; comments Luis Padron, Lisy Corportation. </p>
<p>Upon realizing the nature of the toy, and the product number 9-0-1-1 on each toy, Lisy Corp. sent a letter to stores saying the toy &ldquo;resembles the Twin Towers and an airplane. [It is] &ldquo;totally inappropriate&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lisy says they were sold the toys by <span class="caps">L&M</span> Import and Export. The product was coded as a plastic swing play set and sent in two versions, one with a man swinging between the towers. The product was packed in bulk, with the airplane version out of sight. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So when they packaged it, that box has many toys inside and they never realized it, &lsquo;cause they called it a swing set,&rdquo; says Padron. </p>
<p>Lisy Corp. says they are angry and blame <span class="caps">L&M.</span> They believe the product was manufactured in China. </p>
<p>For the second day in a row, the importer of the toy, <span class="caps">L&M</span> Import and Export refused to comment. But, they told Channel 9 they didn&rsquo;t think it was a big deal, saying they consider it just a toy for children and don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s inappropriate.</p>
