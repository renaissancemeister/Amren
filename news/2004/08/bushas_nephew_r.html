<h1>Bush&rsquo;s Nephew Rips Armed Border Guards</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Stevenson, AP, FortWayne.com, Aug. 21</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MEXICO CITY &mdash; President Bush&rsquo;s nephew, campaigning for overseas votes in Mexico on Saturday, called the federal policy of arming U.S. Border Patrol agents with plastic pellet guns &ldquo;reprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking in a mix of English and sometimes-halting Spanish, George P. Bush said his uncle was not to blame for the gun policy, which has angered Mexicans. He instead blamed it on &ldquo;some local INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) guy who&rsquo;s trying to be tough, act macho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there has been American approval for this policy, that is reprehensible,&rdquo; Bush said of the guns, essentially paintball projectiles filled with chile powder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of barbarous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pellet guns, which were approved at the federal level, have been used on a trial basis since 2001 in California and Arizona. The U.S. Border Patrol fired the pepper-balls in 81 instances in 2002-03 and reported no deaths or severe injuries.</p>
<p>President Bush&rsquo;s Hispanic nephew &mdash; he&rsquo;s the grandson of migrant worker Jose Maria Garnica &mdash; is in Mexico on a week-long visit to drum up support for his uncle among the estimated 1 million Americans living there.</p>
<p>The younger Bush, whose father is Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and mother, Columba, is originally from Mexico, acknowledged at a news conference that the war in Iraq is not popular in Mexico but defended the military action, saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re almost done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that &ldquo;there are some people in our (Republican) party who don&rsquo;t see the benefits of immigration,&rdquo; but promised that President Bush was a proponent of immigration reform.</p>
<p>He called Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez &ldquo;a dictator&rdquo; and cast doubt on his victory last week in a recall referendum, saying Chavez had &ldquo;a long history of fraud.&rdquo; Outside observers, including former President Jimmy Carter, have endorsed the Venezuelan vote counts.</p>
<p>Christopher Fussner, global chairman of Republicans Abroad, which funded Bush&rsquo;s trip, called Mexico &ldquo;the most important country&rdquo; for getting overseas votes.</p>
<p>Fussner said Republicans are advertising in overseas English-language newspapers around the world in hopes of capturing expatriate votes.</p>
<p>Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry&rsquo;s campaign also has enlisted family members to woo voters in Mexico. His sister, Diana Kerry, chairwoman of Americans Overseas for Kerry, visited Mexico City in July.</p>
<p>Kerry supporters also held a voter-registration and ballot-request drive in Guadalajara on Thursday.</p>
