<h1>Woman Fired For Eating &lsquo;Unclean&rsquo; Meat</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>local6.com (Fla.), Aug. 4</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><span class="caps">ORLANDO,</span> Fla. &mdash; A Central Florida woman was fired from her job after eating &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; meat and violating a reported company policy that pork and pork products are not permissible on company premises, according to Local 6 News. </p>
<p>Lina Morales was hired as an administrative assistant at Rising Star &mdash; a Central Florida telecommunications company with strong Muslim ties, Local 6 News reported. </p>
<p>However, 10 months after being hired by Rising Star, religious differences led to her termination. </p>
<p>Morales, who is Catholic, was warned about eating pizza with meat the Muslim faith considered &ldquo;unclean.,&rdquo; Local 6 News reported. She was then fire for eating a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, according to the report. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you telling me they fired you because you had something with ham on it?&rdquo; Local 6 News reporter Mike Holfeld asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Morales said. </p>
<p>Holfeld asked, &ldquo;A pizza and a <span class="caps">BLT </span>sandwich?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Morales said. </p>
<p>Local 6 News obtained the termination letter that states she was fired for refusing to comply with company policy that pork and pork products are not permissible on company premises. </p>
<p>However, by the company&rsquo;s own admission to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that policy is not written, Local 6 News reported. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever sign to or agree to anything that said I will not eat pork?&rdquo; Holfeld asked Morales. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Morales said. &ldquo;When I got hired there, they said we don&rsquo;t care what religion you are.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Attorney Travis Hollifield is representing Morales in a lawsuit against the company. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just un-American,&rdquo; Hollifield said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in compliance with the laws of this country.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Local 6 News reported that the case has precedent-setting issues because it addresses employee rights and religion in the workplace. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic case of religious discrimination,&rdquo; Hollifield said. &ldquo;They have not articulated a single reason other than religious reason behind the policy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The <span class="caps">CEO </span>of Rising Star, Kujaatele Kweli, told Local 6 News that they have tried to create an office that accommodates anybody&rsquo;s religion &mdash; not just Islam. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly you&rsquo;re accommodating,&rdquo; Holfeld said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kweli replied. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have an ecumenical philosophy,&rdquo; Holfeld said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kweli replied. </p>
<p>&ldquo;(Then) shouldn&rsquo;t you be able to accommodate all faiths in the same lunch room?&rdquo; Holfeld asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We do, we can,&rdquo; Kweli said. </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/kweli.JPG" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve dismissed one of your employees for eating pork in the lunch room,&rdquo; Holfeld said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, pork is considered unclean,&rdquo; Kweli said. </p>
<p>The Koran forbids Muslims from eating pork. And according to Kweli, Morales and every employee at the company is advised of the no pork policy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our point of view is to respect the laws of the land and the laws of the land as I understand it is to the accommodate people&rsquo;s right to practice their religions if you can,&rdquo; Kweli said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it impacts other people?&rdquo; Holfeld asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it always impacts other people,&rdquo; Kweli replied. </p>
<p>Orlando attorney Mark Nejame is close to the Muslim community, Local 6 News reported. He said Kweli&rsquo;s intentions may cross constitutional parameters, according to the report. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re making it seem that if you don&rsquo;t follow a certain set of religious practices and beliefs then you&rsquo;re going to be terminated and that&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Nejame said. &ldquo;If this case prevails, what it will mean &mdash; the implications of this case &mdash; is it will eliminate accommodations of religion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Both sides are steadfast in their belief that they are right. Morales is taking the company to court charging discrimination, Local 6 News reported.</p>
