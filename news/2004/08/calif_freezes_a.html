<h1>Calif. Freezes Assets of School for Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOXNews.com, Aug. 9</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. &mdash; California has joined other states in acting against a private school that claimed to award high school diplomas while teaching its immigrant students a curriculum riddled with errors, including the wrong years for World War II and the wrong number of states.</p>
<p>The California Alternative High School in Los Angeles targeted Hispanic immigrants, charging $450 to $1,450 for a 10-week course it said would lead to a valid diploma and help them get into college, find better jobs and get financial aid, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said last week.</p>
<p>But the school&rsquo;s certificate isn&rsquo;t recognized as a high school diploma, Lockyer said, and school officials ignored a previous court order that banned them from telling consumers it was.</p>
<p>Lockyer said the curriculum consisted of a slim workbook riddled with errors, including:</p>
<p> &mdash; The United States has 53 states but the &ldquo;flag has not yet been updated to reflect the addition of the last three states&rdquo; &mdash; Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p> &mdash; World War II began in 1938 and ended in 1942.</p>
<p> &mdash; There are two houses of Congress &mdash; the Senate and the House, and &ldquo;one is for Democrats and the other is for the Republicans, respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s chief executive officer, Daniel Gossai, claimed to have a teaching credential and two doctorates, but prosecutors said they found no evidence that he does. He was a teacher at Victor Valley Community College in the late 1970s, but was fired for immoral conduct, dishonesty and being unfit for service, Lockyer said.</p>
<p>The organization claimed to graduate 1,500 students every 10 weeks from 78 schools across the country.</p>
<p>Indiana Attorney General Steve Carter is investigating six complaints received since May, said spokesman Staci Schneider. &ldquo;All of them focus on misrepresenting the terms of a contract, or the school&rsquo;s courses,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Judges in Nebraska and Iowa ordered the school this year to stop enrolling students.</p>
<p>A consumer protection lawsuit filed by Lockyer last week seeks full restitution for students who paid for the course, civil penalties of $32 million and a permanent injunction against school chief executive officer Daniel Gossai and other school officials.</p>
<p>There was no comment from the school or Gossai. Messages left at school offices in Lomita, Los Angeles and Huntington Park last week were not returned, and Gossai&rsquo;s attorney, Scott Furstman, also didn&rsquo;t return a call.</p>
