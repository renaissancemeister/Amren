<h1>L.A. Hospital Staff Failed To Count Surgical Tools After Operations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Sign On San Diego, Jul. 29</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LOS ANGELES &mdash; Medical staff at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center failed to check whether they left instruments inside patients after hundreds of surgeries, according to the county health director. 		<br>
A metal clamp was found last month inside a patient at the hospital for 10 days, revealing the widespread failure of hospital staff to count surgical tools after operations.</p>
<p>County health director Dr. Thomas Garthwaite said a review of several hundred surgeries performed at the hospital over the last five months showed no documentation of instruments being counted. </p>
<p>Garthwaite said he couldn&rsquo;t explain why staff violated hospital and industry rules that call for them to count instruments before and after all surgeries. </p>
<p>Studies show that leaving tools inside a surgical patient is rare, occurring in about one in 1,500 abdominal surgeries. But it happened to Jeffery Baber, who had a five-inch clamp left in his body after surgery last month. </p>
<p>Baber, a 42-year-old Compton mechanic, underwent an emergency trauma operation June 22 for multiple gunshot wounds. </p>
<p>An X-ray technician discovered the clamp while preparing Baber for a separate surgery on his leg. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They did another X-ray and another X-ray,&rdquo; Baber said. &ldquo;It showed plain as day, they had one of the clamps just sitting there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Dr. Anthony McCloud, the surgeon who first operated on Baber, performed another surgery to remove the clamp, a scissors-like instrument used to cut off blood flow to certain areas. </p>
<p>Baber said he was thankful the error didn&rsquo;t kill him, and that no one has apologized to him for the mistake. </p>
<p>The clamp error is the latest in a series of patient-care lapses identified in the last year at King/Drew Medical Center, a county-owned hospital in Willowbrook, about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Only six months earlier, the health department brought in a crisis team and outside consultants to oversee changes and address systemic concerns about nursing care at the hospital. </p>
<p>Garthwaite said surgeons are ultimately responsible for what goes on in their operating rooms. </p>
<p>Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, president of the National Quality Forum, a patient safety group in Washington, D.C., said King/Drew may never know how many instruments were left in patients because surgical staff members weren&rsquo;t following basic rules.</p>
