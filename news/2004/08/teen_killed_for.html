<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vanderbijlpark &mdash; A young gymnast was stabbed to death for a cellphone he didn&rsquo;t have while helping a friend find her missing dog in a local park. </p>
<p>Eldau-Rico Wright, 17, was stabbed twice in the chest. </p>
<p>Megan Coetzee, 11, told on Monday how she bumped into Eldau-Rico in the street and asked him to help her look for the family&rsquo;s miniature Dobermann, Tammy, who had disappeared earlier in the day. </p>
<p>Megan and Eldau-Rico both attended Destinata School, a school in Meyerton for children with learning disabilities. </p>
<p>Megan said: &ldquo;Eldau-Rico and I walked to the park near our house in Maasdorp Street and young guys shouted at me &lsquo;Hey baby&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t answer, but they came closer and asked Eldau-Rico for his cellphone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>According to Megan, Eldau-Rico said he did not have one. The next minute, one of the youths pulled a knife out of his sleeve and stabbed Eldau-Rico twice in the chest. </p>
<p>&lsquo;He collapsed in our street&rsquo; </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/eldaurico.JPG" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> They then apparently ran off towards Sharpeville. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Eldau-Rico looked out for me and said I must be careful that they didn&rsquo;t hurt me. We should run away.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But, the whole time we were running, he wa saying, &lsquo;Please, please&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He collapsed in our street (Maasdorp Street). He stood up again. But, then he fell and didn&rsquo;t get up.&rdquo; </p>
<p>According to Linda Rumble, a neighbour of Megan&rsquo;s family, the child ran to their house in hysterics and screamed &ldquo;my friend has been stabbed with a knife&rdquo;. </p>
<p>According to Rumble, Eldau-Rico was still alive when her husband, Neville, got to him. They phoned the police and called an ambulance, but the teenager died about 10 minutes later.</p>
