<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two French journalists have been taken hostage in Iraq by Islamic militants demanding the lifting of a ban on the Islamic headscarf in French schools. </p>
<p>According to the Arabic satellite news channel, Al-Jazeera, the kidnappers are members of the Islamic Army in Iraq, the same group that claimed responsibility for killing Italian journalist, Enzo Baldoni. </p>
<p>Al-Jazeera has identified the hostages as Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale and Georges Malbrunot of the Paris daily newspaper, Le Figaro. </p>
<p>The group has given France 48 hours to rescind the ban on Islamic headscarves in schools. The ban is due to come into effect in September. </p>
<p>The journalists had been missing for nine days. Their employers had expressed hopes they would be safe as France had been an outspoken opponent of the war on Iraq. </p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac earlier this year signed the law, forbidding religious apparel and conspicuous signs of a student&rsquo;s religious affiliation. </p>
<p>The Islamic Army of Iraq described the ban as an &ldquo;aggression on the Islamic religion and personal freedoms&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www9.sbs.com.au/theworldnews/region.php?id=92975&amp;region=3"><div class="title">France Firm On Headscarf Ban</div></a></p>
<p><em>SBS, Aug. 30</em></p>
<p>France has vowed it will not repeal a law banning Islamic headscarves in schools, despite the demands of Iraqi kidnappers holding two French journalists captive. </p>
<p>Government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope said the law will come into effect as planned at the start of the academic year on Thursday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The law will be applied,&rdquo; Mr Cope said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;These are values of tolerance, respect and above all the principle that in France anyone can exercise his or her religion, while respecting those of others,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>The law bans religious symbols in schools, including Jewish skullcaps and Christian crosses, in a bid to strengthen France&rsquo;s separation of religion and state. </p>
<p>The Islamic Army in Iraq said late on Saturday it was giving France 48 hours to rescind the headscarf ban. </p>
<p>Although it did not explicitly threaten to kill the men, it murdered an Italian journalist last week after Rome ignored an ultimatum to pull its troops out of Iraq. </p>
<p>France has sent Foreign Minister Michel Barnier to the Egyptian capital Cairo to press for the hostages&rsquo; release. </p>
<p>Mr Barnier said a top ministry official will visit Baghdad soon to further pus for the freeing of Radio France&rsquo;s Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper. </p>
<p>The pair disappeared in Iraq on August 20, the day they were to have left Baghdad for the Shi&rsquo;ite holy city of Najaf, the scene of fierce fighting between US forces and Shi&rsquo;ite militia loyal to radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. </p>
<p>On Saturday Arabic-language Al-Jazeera television broadcast images of the two men &mdash; both Middle East experts with years of experience in the region &mdash; along with the ultimatum from the Islamic Army in Iraq. </p>
<p>After a series of crisis meetings, French President Jacques Chirac on Sunday dispatched Mr Barnier to the region. </p>
<p>He is to meet with General Omar Suleiman, head of Egypt&rsquo;s secret service, who has been following events in Iraq closely, and Arab League Secretary General Amr Mussa. </p>
<p>The head of Radio France, Jean-Paul Cluzel, said Mr Barnier will also use the trip to explain the rationale behind the law banning religious insignia to the Arab media. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He will explain that the values of human equality &hellip;  apply to all our fellow citizens,&rdquo; said Mr Cluzel.</p>
