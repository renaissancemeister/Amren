<h1>Splintered Plank</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Krikorian, National Review Online, Aug. 26</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before the draft Republican platform was released yesterday, the immigration plank was being billed as an independent effort, not directed by the White House. The selection of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Rep. Melissa Hart to head the subcommittee that would address immigration was <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040815-120531-6211r.htm">spun</a> last week as a concession to pro-control conservatives, despite her mediocre <a href="http://grades.betterimmigration.com/testgrades.php3?District=PA04&amp;VIPID=932">voting record</a> on immigration. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, the platform committee co-chairman, denied that the White House was writing the platform immigration plank, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040823-121521-2852r.htm">telling the <i>Washington Times</i></a> that &#147;I have talked to Karl [Rove] about the platform for a total of less than two minutes since I began working on this in the last month.&#148;</p>
<p>They must have packed a lot of information into those two minutes, because the draft platform&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040824-115347-2012r.htm">immigration section</a> echoed in every particular the president&rsquo;s call for a massive guest-worker amnesty. It included the very same language, about matching &#147;willing foreign workers with willing U.S. employers,&#148; and the same disingenuous disavowal of amnesty.</p>
<p>Nor were there any substantive challenges to the wording. During last night&rsquo;s platform committee deliberations, only trivial semantic changes were offered. This despite the fact that Tom Tancredo, head of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, has floated three important amendments: to oppose any form of legal status for illegal aliens (whether or not it&rsquo;s called &#147;amnesty&#148;), to call on states to bar illegals from obtaining driver&rsquo;s licenses, and to oppose the administration&rsquo;s recent agreement with Mexico to provide Social Security payments to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that the draft language on immigration went unchallenged, since each member of the platform committee was screened on his views&mdash;immigration being one of the most prominent&mdash;before he was given a subcommittee assignment, in order to avoid ideological deviationism.</p>
<p>Of course, in one sense, the specifics of any platform aren&rsquo;t really all that important. The 2000 platform, for instance, discussed such momentous issues as &#147;wellness&#148; and the Samoan land-tenure system. But a look at immigration in the past several platforms highlights this year&rsquo;s radical departure from the views of the Republican rank and file:</p>
<p><a href="http://reagan2020.com/platforms/republican/rep.992.html"><b>1992</b></a><b>:</b> &#147;Illegal entry into the United States, on the other hand, threatens the social compact on which immigration is based.&#148;</p>
<p><a href="http://reagan2020.com/platforms/republican/rep.996.html"><b>1996</b></a><b>:</b> &#147;Republicans believe that by eliminating the magnet for illegal immigration, increasing border security, enforcing our immigration laws, and producing counterfeit-proof documents, we will finally put an end to the illegal immigration crisis.&#148;</p>
<p><a href="http://reagan2020.com/platforms/republican/rep.2000.html"><b>2000</b></a><b>:</b> &#147;We therefore endorse the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform,&#148; including more resources for interior immigration enforcement and an end to extended-family legal-immigration preferences.</p>
<p>Compare these with this year&rsquo;s draft, referring to the president&rsquo;s amnesty plan: &#147;This new program would allow workers who currently hold jobs to come out of the shadows and to participate legally in America&rsquo;s economy,&#148; and &#147;would allow men and women who enter the program to apply for citizenship in the same manner as those who apply from outside the United States.&#148; Notice the lack of the word &#147;illegal&#148; with respect to illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s effort to choreograph the platform&rsquo;s approach to immigration&mdash;an exertion greater than those undertaken in behalf of other platform issues&mdash;clearly shows that the White House knows its views are not shared by most Republicans. David Frum <a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2004/back404panel.html">tells</a> of being on tour for his most recent book when the president made his amnesty speech in January, and in Frum&rsquo;s radio interviews &#147;it was like being there on the first day of the Somme when the machine guns opened; I mean, every show you did, every question.&#148; He and many, many others called the administration to tell them, in Frum&rsquo;s words, that &#147;there&rsquo;s a problem up here in Americaland; the Americans are unhappy about this.&#148;</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that voters out in the real world hate amnesty, the policy complications also keep piling up. A Center for Immigration Studies <a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2004/fiscalrelease.html">report</a> released yesterday found that the net fiscal cost imposed by illegal-alien households on the federal government (i.e., federal services used minus federal taxes paid) is more than $10 billion, and that the figure would nearly <i>triple</i> if the illegals received legal status.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so long a party can divorce itself from the views of &#147;Americaland&#148; without losing support. The White House understands it has an immigration problem, but is trying to stage-manage its way out. The simpler solution would be to embrace better immigration policies.</p>
