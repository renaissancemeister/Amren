<h1>Activist Charges Officials Promoting Guest Worker Plan With &lsquo;Treason&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chad Groening, AgapePress, Aug. 17</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An immigration reform activist is calling comments made by Homeland Security undersecretary Asa Hutchinson nothing but political pandering to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Times, Hutchinson wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that President Bush&rsquo;s guest worker program would help eliminate sleepless nights for illegal aliens who are worried that a single misstep might result in their deportation.</p>
<p>But Susan Tully of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) accuses Hutchinson and the Department of Homeland Security of failing to look out for American citizens. &ldquo;These people are not representing you and I,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They are representing foreign nationals, and they are out there in the forefront representing and advocating for them every day of the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully wonders why these government officials apparently do not care about American taxpayers&rsquo; sleepless nights. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anybody up there saying &lsquo;What about those who can&rsquo;t afford to pay their taxes and their sleepless nights?&rsquo; Are they going to let us off the hook?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Is anybody going to advocate on our behalf, where about 50 percent of everything we earn is now being taxed by the United States government. Where is help for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The midwestern field director for FAIR says the recent comments by Hutchinson represent the &ldquo;treasonous&rdquo; kowtowing of many U.S. government officials to illegal aliens. &ldquo;These people are elected, they take an oath that they are going to serve the citizens of the United States, and all I see is pandering to illegal aliens by all of them,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Tully says hardworking American taxpayers are expected to be honest and honorable, even while they are being forced to pay the bills for those who break the law &mdash; and she asks, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s advocating on our behalf?&rdquo; Officials like Hutchinson are not representing American citizens, Tully insists, but instead are constantly acting on the behalf of foreign nationals.</p>
