<h1><a href="https://politics.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11375,1274253,00.html">BNP Faces Internal Revolt And Financial Turmoil</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Taylor, The Guardian, Aug. 2</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National party, which fielded a record number of candidates in this year&rsquo;s local and European elections, is in disarray, with senior figures leading a revolt against the chairman, Nick Griffin, and growing concern about the organisation&rsquo;s financial situation. </p>
<p>The BNP got more than 800,000 votes in the European elections in June and has 21 councillors. But it failed to create the &ldquo;political earthquake&rdquo; Mr Griffin predicted and he has come under renewed pressure from activists who are uneasy with his attempts to portray the BNP as a respectable political party. </p>
<p>In the past few months one branch and several organisers have been suspended for openly supporting Mr Griffin&rsquo;s opponents and many activists in the north-west and London are now opposed to his leadership. </p>
<p>The Guardian has also learned that there is growing speculation about the party&rsquo;s finances. This month Barclays closed all of the BNP&rsquo;s accounts and on Friday the party failed to meet a second deadline to hand its accounts to the Electoral Commission, leaving it open to prosecution and a Â£5,000 fine. </p>
<p>Last night a spokeswoman for the commission said the original extension had been granted in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But as of Friday [the second deadline] we had not received the BNP&rsquo;s statement of accounts.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A BNP spokesman, Phil Edwards, said the delay was &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; and had been caused by the large number of people who had made donations since the elections. He said: &ldquo;There is nothing wrong with our finances: these rules have been put in place by the Electoral Commission to catch us out.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tensions within the BNP have been heightened by the arrest of six members after a BBC documentary which revealed an organisation riven by racism and violence. </p>
<p>It is thought the programme, in which a BNP council candidate revealed how he had conducted a series of attacks on an Asian business, has put off comparatively moderate supporters, who back Mr Griffin&rsquo;s leadership and provide the BNP with crucial financial help. </p>
<p>The internal revolt is being led by a BNP founder and hardliner, John Tyndall, and his deputy, Richard Edmunds. Although banned from speaking at BNP meetings by Mr Griffin, they have been welcomed by several branches. </p>
<p>This month Mr Edmunds spoke at a Rochdale BNP meeting, which resulted in the whole branch being suspended by Mr Griffin. Earlier in the year Mr Tyndall spoke at a meeting in Clitheroe, which resulted in further suspensions. </p>
<p>Since the elections Mr Tyndall has also been a guest at a far-right meeting in Leeds and other branches in south and north-west London are openly supporting him, leading to claims that Mr Griffin is losing his grip on the party. </p>
<p>Nick Lowles, from the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight, said: &ldquo;Griffin is under pressure. There are now large sections of the party in the north-west, London and the south-east which are openly opposed to his leadership. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a lot of demoralisation among activists who be lieved that by following Griffin&rsquo;s moderate line they would have MEPs and London assembly members, and the fact that has not happened is leading to widespread anger.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A split over whether to allow non-whites to become members &mdash; a move backed by Mr Griffin but bitterly opposed by most of the rank and file &mdash; has been the focus for anti-Griffin sentiment. Last week Mr Griffin, who had insisted that allowing non-white members was essential to avoid a potential legal challenge, was forced to climb down in the face of fierce opposition. </p>
<p>Writing on the National Vanguard website Mr Tyndall said: &ldquo;I have ventured the opinion that the agenda is one aimed at splitting the BNP, and that all these various liberal postures &mdash; of which this [allowing non-white members] latest one is clearly the last straw &mdash; have been aimed at driving genuine racial nationalists out of the party so that it can be reshaped and reinvented in a way that bears not the slightest resemblance to the intentions of its founders.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is thought that Mr Tyndall intends to stand against Mr Griffin as soon as the party&rsquo;s constitution allows. Mr Edwards said the Tyndall faction was &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; and its aim was to destabilise the party. Mr Griffin&rsquo;s position may be safe for now because of a lack of suitable candidates. But Mr Lowles said the disenchantment with him could prove fatal in the long run. </p>
<p>&ldquo;His internal opponents scent blood and seem determined to expose any wrongdoing, whether political, financial or personal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
