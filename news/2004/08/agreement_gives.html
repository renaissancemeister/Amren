<h1><a href="https://www.carryingcapacity.org/">Agreement Gives Illegal Aliens $50 Billion In Social Security Benefits!</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrying Capacity Network</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the <b>Social Security Totalization Agreement</b> recently endorsed by President Bush, <b><u>ANY</b></u> Mexican national who can <b>&#147;prove&#148;</b> he worked in the US for <strong>5 years</strong> will be entitled to draw Social Security benefits. </p>
<b><i><p>(Recall that illegal aliens can &#147;prove&#148; anything with forged documents, that Social Security is notorious for poor record-keeping, in part because of the &#147;identity theft&#148; these illegals practice by using others&rsquo; Social Security numbers). The Congress has limited time [and the clock&rsquo;s been ticking] to rescind this Agreement. </p>
</b></i><p>Commissioner Barnhart, of the U.S. Social Security Administration and Dr. Santiago Levy Algazi, Director General of the Mexican Social Security Institute, signed a U.S.-Mexican Social Security agreement at a ceremony held in Guadalajara, Mexico, on June 29, 2004.</p>
<p>This pending agreement between the United States and our southern neighbor, Mexico will dramatically reverse the current prohibition of providing Social Security benefits to illegal immigrant workers from Mexico. Indeed, there is even correspondence proving that it was on a fast track to be established, which included plans for erecting a huge new building at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City just to deal with the swarms of people anticipated to sign-up for this raid on our Social Security Trust Fund.</p>
<p>An alien may receive payments outside the United States, including benefits based on unauthorized work in the United States, if he or she is a citizen of a country with which the United States has a totalization agreement.</p>
<p>A totalization agreement with Mexico is different than with the other 20 countries for several reasons. First of all, none of those countries have public policies that encourage illegal immigration to the United States.</p>
<p>Second, because other countries have sent relatively few workers to the United States over the years and very few illegal workers, illegal immigration from these countries is essentially a nonissue. That is, there are insignificant numbers of illegal aliens residing in the United States from such countries as Switzerland, South Korea, Australia, Germany, or Spain, which have had totalization agreements with the United States for many years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.house.gov/">We urge you to write, e-mail, phone call and fax your Representative</a>, urging him or her to cosponsor <b>H. Res. 720</b>, the resolution that rescinds this agreement that literally gives away our Social Security Trust Fund to Mexico. <b>This is no exaggeration.</b> Conservative estimates state it will <b>drain</b> as much as<b> $50 billion </b>out of the fund.</p>
<b><p>There is only a 60 day window when Congress can revoke this agreement, so we have to act now.</p>
</b>
<p>The few days we have to repeal this agreement are the same few days preceding the November election, when every Congressmen is campaigning hard for reelection and the Congress is seldom in session.<em> The good news</em> is you can catch your congressperson while they are back in your district to tell them, in person, you dissaprove of this agreement and to ask them to co-sponser H. Res.720.</p>
<p>To stop this agreement, it is absolutely essential that we generate maximum <u>grassroots opposition</u> to this agreement, since &#147;the powers&#148; in both parties support it. </p>
<p>BUT, WE CAN STOP THIS AGREEMENT <b><u>if</b></u> each and every one of us does just three things:</p>
<p>1) <a href="https://www.house.gov/">Write, call, and fax your Representative and Senators and urge them to oppose the Mexico Social Security Totalization Agreement and co-sponser H. Res. 720)<b>.</b></a> And,</p>
<p>2) Encourage your Representatives and Senators <b><u>to support a</b></u> <b><u>moratorium</b></u> on all immigration in excess of 100,000 per year. Pushing a moratorium makes it clear where you stand, and creates leverage to defeat the Social Security Totalization Agreement. And, </p>
<p>3) MOST IMPORTANT, <b><u>MOBILIZE grassroots support</b></u> for the defeat of the agreement. <u>We can defeat this agreement only if we increase grassroots support</u>.</p>
<u><p>Give gift memberships in Carrying Capacity Network to <b>each and</b> <b>every person</b> who might be encouraged by this gift to oppose this agreement</u>. </p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.carryingcapacity.org/">www.carryingcapacity.org</a> to give gift memberships online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.house.gov/">Write, e-mail, phone call and fax to your senators and congressmen to kill this agreement.</a></p>
