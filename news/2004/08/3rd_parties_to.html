<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=40124">3rd Parties To Merge Into 1?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily.com, Aug. 25</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><p>Representatives of so-called &#147;third parties&#148; are discussing the possibility of merging in hopes of creating more influence for those voters disenchanted with the two major political parties. </p></p>
<p><p>A recent meeting organized by the Clarion Call to Converge Committee included national chairmen or representatives from the <a href="http://www.theamericanparty.org/">American Party</a>, <a href="http://www.americafirstparty.org/">America First Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.usiap.org/">Independent American Party.</a> According to meeting organizers, the <a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com/">Constitution Party</a> chairman planned to attend the Aug. 14 powwow but was unable to due to Hurricane Charley complications. </p></p>
<p><p>&#147;We were able to share points of view that will lead to future talks toward the goal of merging,&#148; said conference MC Jeffery J. Cole in a statement. </p></p>
<p><p>The participants in the meeting, which was held in Plainfield, Ind., identified core principles all parties involved could build a merger upon. They included being &#147;pro-Christian, pro-family, pro-life and pro-Constitution,&#148; said the statement. </p></p>
<p><p>Cole reportedly began the meeting by stressing the &#147;urgent&#148; need of a merger to take place. If like-minded third parties were to merge, proponents argue, the united party would have much more political clout than smaller individual groups. </p></p>
<p><p>Cole told the participants: &#147;The Clarion Call Committee has been witness to hundreds and perhaps thousands of comments from citizens who are disenchanted with the two-party system. And the more politically astute of those citizens have asserted the question: &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the third-party movement merge together?&rsquo; It is a fair question. </p></p>
<p><p>&#147;Based upon this, and the sense of urgency most of us feel, the slippery slope our nation is on sliding toward totalitarianism, does it not behoove those  &hellip;  who hear the godly call toward liberty to mobilize the sentiment in uniting our endeavors?&#148; </p></p>
<p><p>Cole said third parties must unite if they expect to become a viable force against the Democrats and the Republicans. </p></p>
<p><p>According to the committee&rsquo;s statement, its chairman, Bob Solomon, stressed the need to united so as to better combat globalization. </p></p>
<p><p>Solomon said, &#147;You can stay divided and lose all your parties to a one-world government, or join together and make us a viable force against the political system that is ignoring our Constitution and leading us into a one-world government.&#148; </p></p>
<p><p>Not all participants were excited about the idea of merging. According to the committee&rsquo;s statement, John Hey of the America First Party expressed concern that certain religious biases could prevent various factions from coming together. </p></p>
<p><p>Another meeting of party representatives is planned for Nov. 6, the statement indicated. <a href="mailto:jthfrancis@earthlink.net">John Francis</a> is the third-party liaison for the Clarion Call to Converge Committee. </p></p>
<p><p>The current issue of WorldNetDaily&rsquo;s popular magazine, Whistleblower, is entitled &#147;Revolt on the Right: Why the Republican Party is losing conservative voters.&#148; It explores how some voters are abandoning, or considering abandoning, their traditional political home, the Republican Party, in favor of a third party. </p></p>
