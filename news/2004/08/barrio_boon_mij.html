<h1>Barrio Boon: Mijos Figures Are All The (Commercial) Rage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Macias, Sacramento Bee, Aug. 3</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the toy aisles at Wal-Mart, Baby Boy is now in the same neighborhood as Barney the Dinosaur. </p>
<p>The 6-inch figure is an inner-city Latino kid sporting fat sneakers, baggy overalls and a bald head. His fellow Mijos (&ldquo;little ones&rdquo; in Spanish) have nicknames that come straight out of the barrio, such as &ldquo;Spooky,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lil Dre&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brownie.&rdquo; And they&rsquo;re ready for a play date with Middle America. </p>
<p>This month, the first series of six Mijos figures will be shipped nationwide to Kmart, and they will be on shelves at Target and Toys &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us later this year. Toy Play, the company that manufactures the 6-inch Mijos for a suggested price of $6.99 each, says 250,000 figures have been sold at Wal-Mart since May. </p>
<p>These icons from Chicano &ldquo;cholo&rdquo; culture are going mainstream, building on a strong fan base of Latinos who have nearly $171 billion in buying power in California. </p>
<p>Mijos enjoy a street credibility you can&rsquo;t find on Sesame Street, and in a toy market that thrives on fantasy, the scrappy Mijos live in a bittersweet world, working toward a better life. </p>
<p>Two-inch versions of Mijos and their once controversial counterparts, the Homies, can be found in gum-ball machines. Pop in 50 cents at a Mexican market or a corner store, twist the knob, and if it&rsquo;s your lucky day, maybe DJ Jokachild will fall into your palms. This sought-after Homie comes poised behind a set of turntables. </p>
<p>Jose Montoya, a prominent Chicano artist from Sacramento, can&rsquo;t resist when he has a pocket full of quarters. He&rsquo;s collected about three dozen Mijos and Homies toys. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think these do a good job of capturing our &lsquo;cholitos&rsquo; (little cholos),&rdquo; says Montoya, 71. &ldquo;Everybody needs an identity, and sometimes the way we dress becomes our &lsquo;placaso,&rsquo; our tag. It&rsquo;s one way of people demystifying old notions about people. </p>
<p>&ldquo;(Forty years ago) being a Chicano was weird in Iowa and Nebraska,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;You go through there now and it&rsquo;s all &lsquo;raza.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re everywhere.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Collectors of Homies and Mijos also are everywhere, and they take the toys seriously. Hazel Weatherford, a former Sacramentan who lives in the Bay Area, is building a staircase for her Mijos and Homies collection. Elaine Casillas, a deputy district attorney in Stanislaus County, has Homies and Mijos decorating her home and office. </p>
<p>Benito Dimas, a math teacher at Sacramento High School, boasts perhaps the area&rsquo;s ultimate Homies and Mijos collection. He owns about 200. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up cholo in (Sacramento&rsquo;s) south area,&rdquo; says Dimas. &ldquo;The Mijos are great because they have their little nicknames, like &lsquo;Spooky&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mocoso.&rsquo; These are the names that kids grow up with. A lot of Chicano kids don&rsquo;t understand the old-school style of growing up.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mijos and Homies are created by David Gonzales, a graphic artist and designer based in the East Bay. He&rsquo;s brought Chicano-centric products to the shopping mall, first with T-shirts that were sold at <span class="caps">J.C.</span> Penney, Miller&rsquo;s Outpost and Hot Topic. </p>
<p>Gonzales says Mijos mythology is a mix of hi-jinks and hard knocks. My Little Pony and Bob the Builder are child&rsquo;s play compared with the Mijos&rsquo; world. </p>
<p>Lil Dre, based on one of Gonzales&rsquo; sons, is the wide-eyed leader of the Mijos. He loves Chicano art and strives to be mayor so he can uplift the Mijos&rsquo; neighborhood. Some of his fellow Mijos need the help. Poor Boy always is broke and hopes <span class="caps">BMX </span>bike riding will wheelie him to a better fortune. Chorriyo is a toddler with a perpetually dirty diaper because his parents are never around. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Their world is real,&rdquo; says Gonzales, during a call from his Emeryville studio. &ldquo;Their feet get stuck on gum. They read the graffiti on the walls. They live in Oaktown (Oakland). There&rsquo;s a cynicism about the kids, where, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s our world, but don&rsquo;t feel sorry for us. Our friends are with us.&rsquo; They don&rsquo;t quite realize yet that their life is tough.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Still, most Mijos are like kids who can be found on any elementary school playground. Spooky is the resident scaredy cat, Chunky Chaz is a junk-food junkie, and Bubba bullies the other Mijos for lunch money. </p>
<p>In Gonzales&rsquo; third Mijos book for Scholastic, the crew takes a field trip to Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco. The mischievous Mijos accidentally break the shark tank and flood the aquarium. </p>
<p><img src="/news/2004/08/mijos.JPG" alt="" class="left" style="float:left;padding-right:2em" /> &ldquo;I grew up a big &lsquo;Peanuts&rsquo; fan, and I just like drawing kids,&rdquo; says Gonzales. &ldquo;With Mijos, I wanted a universal thing where anyone in the country could relate to what their lives are about.&rdquo; </p>
<p>With long eyelashes and baby faces, the Mijos are less hardcore than their Homies counterparts. Willie G, the Homie most coveted by collectors, is an ex-gangbanger and disabled youth counselor who sits in a wheelchair. He is accompanied by a pet pit bull. The Tennishoe Pimp, another neighborhood Homie, is decked out in a purple suit and grips a wad of $100 bills. </p>
<p>Not everyone saw the Homies as fun and games. Five years ago, as the Homies hit $1 million in sales, the Los Angeles Police Department claimed the toys were glorifying a gangbanger lifestyle. As a result, the Vallarta supermarket chain pulled Homies from its stores. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Homies are low-riders from East <span class="caps">L.A. </span>where it&rsquo;s all about looking cool and having the baddest car,&rdquo; says Gonzales. &ldquo;(Mijos) is just a fun group of kids. I don&rsquo;t want a bad image with retailers. They don&rsquo;t want edgy items, and that&rsquo;s not what this is. They&rsquo;re just growing up in Oakland instead of the suburbs. So far, there hasn&rsquo;t been any controversy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Toy Play is eyeing 6-to 11-year-old boys for its prime Mijos demographic. Given their roots in Chicano subculture, the Mijos are expected to sell well with urban Latinos. The Mijos&rsquo; manufacturer also is thinking of audiences beyond the barrio. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big believer in urban and hip hop,&rdquo; says Jonathan Breiter, vice president of the Betesh Group, the parent company of Toy Play. &ldquo;Our research shows that everything is meshing together. The superstars of music today are hip-hop/pop singers. It&rsquo;s crossed over &mdash; white, black, Hispanic, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Subcultures can be watered down once they enter the mainstream. Some Mijos collectors are in a quandary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that they&rsquo;re mainstream, it&rsquo;s not like, &lsquo;Ooh, you&rsquo;ve got that? That&rsquo;s neat,&rsquo; &ldquo; says Dimas, the local collector. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s just at the store. It takes away the novelty of it. (I&rsquo;ve) spent $20 in a gum-ball machine trying to get two or three characters.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mijos mania is just beginning. Mervyn&rsquo;s is carrying a line of Mijos clothes, and kids soon will be able to scoot around in Mijos shoes by Buster Brown. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When my kids were 5 years old, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy them a shirt that said &lsquo;Homies,&rsquo; &ldquo; says Gonzales. &ldquo;But I would buy them something that said &lsquo;Mijos.&rsquo; &ldquo; </p>
<p>Gonzales also is planning a Mijos cartoon series and video game with Electronic Arts (EA), the makers of &ldquo;Madden <span class="caps">NFL</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup.&rdquo; Breakdancing and talking Mijos are on the drawing board as well. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Gonzales envisions his Mijos characters being licensed on pretty much anything that kids can get their hands on, including night lights, alarm clocks and bedding. </p>
<p>Hold the quarters and grab some dollar bills. The Mijos have graduated from the gum-ball machine.</p>
