			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>news24.com (SA), Aug. 8</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harare &mdash; Famine has claimed the lives of 152 people, mostly children, in the western Zimbabwe city of Bulawayo, it was reported on Sunday. </p>
<p>The weekly independent Standard newspaper quoted from records of the Bulawayo city councils city health department records as saying that 29 people had died of malnutrition in July. </p>
<p>It brings to 152 the number of famine-related deaths reported in Bulawayo this year, although the records did not show the number of deaths in April. </p>
<p>Bulawayo is the only large urban centre in Zimbabwe where authorities monitor deaths caused by malnutrition. In Harare, however, the capitals council this year reported a substantial increase in chronic under-nutrition, especially among children. </p>
<p>The latest deaths come after orders by President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s government to Western aid agencies to end famine relief operations. </p>
<p>It claims a record harvest of maize, the national staple food, has been harvested this year, despite United Nations forecasts that about 4.5m people will need food aid to avoid starvation. </p>
<p>In the last two years, the UN has kept up to six million people at a time alive with food aid deliveries after the country&rsquo;s once abundant agricultural industry was devastated by a campaign of massive and illegal seizures of land owned by the highly productive white commercial farming community. </p>
<p>Mugabe&rsquo;s critics say they fear he plans to use food as a political weapon to force starving people to vote for his ruling party in parliamentary elections scheduled for March next year. </p>
<p>The Bulawayo health department report said that of the 29 people who died in July, 21 were children under the age of five. </p>
<p>In September last year, the World Food Programme estimated that 2.5m of the country&rsquo;s urban population needed famine relief. The agency concentrated its food deliveries to rural areas, while food distribution in towns and cities was done by smaller independent agencies, but on a much smaller scale.</p>
