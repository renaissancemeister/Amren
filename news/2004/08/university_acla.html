<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040803-110117-6379r.htm">University &lsquo;Clarifies&rsquo; Its Policy On Course</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Richardson, Washington Times, Aug. 4</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DENVER &mdash; The University of Colorado at Boulder announced yesterday that it no longer would restrict an education course to minority and first-generation college students after receiving complaints that the restrictions violated equal-protection laws.</p>
<p>Educators had limited fall enrollment for the Friday section of &ldquo;School and Society&rdquo; to &ldquo;students of color&rdquo; and first-generation college students, saying the restriction offered &ldquo;a much safer and open environment&rdquo; in which to discuss issues of race, class and the sexes. </p>
<p>After three students threatened last week to take the university to court, however, Lorrie Shepard, dean of the School of Education, issued a &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; stating that the course would be open to all students, although &ldquo;underrepresented&rdquo; students were specifically encouraged to enroll. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the intention of the School of Education to recruit students of color and first-generation college students to participate in a special section of [the course] for the purpose of creating a critical mass of such students,&rdquo; said Lorrie Shepard, dean of the School of Education. </p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the language of the e-mail which restricted enrollment exclusively on the basis of race was in error and is against university policy,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Robert Corry, a Denver lawyer representing the students, called the university&rsquo;s decision &ldquo;a total victory.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very happy. All our demands have been satisfied,&rdquo; Mr. Corry said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a victory for equal protection and nondiscrimination at CU.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Corry had said he would file a federal lawsuit unless the university opened the class to all students. University officials had argued that the restriction complied with anti-discrimination laws because the same course also was offered to white students who were the first in their families to attend college. </p>
<p>They also stressed that the course was offered to all students on different days and times. But critics said that such a rationale mirrored the arguments used to justify &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; schools for black students in the decades before the civil rights era. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen this before &mdash; it was called &lsquo;Brown versus the Board of Education,&rsquo; &ldquo; said Brad Jones, a Colorado senior, referring to the 1954 Supreme Court decision that struck down &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; educational facilities. </p>
<p>&ldquo;School and Society&rdquo; is mandatory for education majors, but the course is also popular among non-majors because it fulfills the university&rsquo;s general graduation requirement for &ldquo;culture and gender diversity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In her statement, Miss Shepard continued to stress the importance of creating a classroom environment welcoming to &ldquo;students of diverse backgrounds.&rdquo;</p>
