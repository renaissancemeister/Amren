<h1>Miami Herald Pulls Features Magazine</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, Tallahassee.com, Aug. 12</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MIAMI &mdash; The Miami Herald pulled its daily features magazine from Tuesday&rsquo;s editions because it contained what could have been perceived as racially insensitive content, the newspaper said Wednesday.</p>
<p>A small story on the front page of Tuesday&rsquo;s Herald informed readers that the newspaper&rsquo;s Tropical Life section would not run that day and its content could be found elsewhere in the paper, but gave no details on why it didn&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>The concern was over a headline that was juxtaposed over an illustration for a story on Olympic athletes and doping. The headline &ldquo;How they will cheat&rdquo; was placed over an illustration of a bulked-up athlete with a dark complexion.</p>
<p>Much of the magazine&rsquo;s content was moved to other sections in Tuesday&rsquo;s edition, including its daily puzzles, advice column, horoscope and movie listings. Tuesday&rsquo;s comic strips ran in Wednesday&rsquo;s Tropical Life, and Thursday&rsquo;s magazine was to run two days&rsquo; worth of comics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magazine Tropical Life had an editorial production issue that could have been perceived by some readers as being racially insensitive,&rdquo; said Tom Fiedler, the Herald&rsquo;s executive editor.</p>
<p>Fiedler said the editor who wrote the headline and the illustrator were not working side-by-side on the magazine&rsquo;s front cover, and the decision to pull the section was made only after it was printed and the words and illustration were seen together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the headline was overlaid over the illustration it became a double entendre statement that could be misinterpreted by readers,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Fiedler said he didn&rsquo;t want to risk offending readers by detailing the problem with the magazine in the Tuesday story.</p>
