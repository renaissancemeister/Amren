<h1>Jury Convicts Claremont Professor In Staged Hate Crime Case</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, DailyBulletin.com, Aug. 18</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>POMONA, Calif. &mdash; A Claremont McKenna College psychology professor was convicted Wednesday of falsely reporting her car was vandalized and spray-painted with racist and anti-Semitic slurs while she was speaking at a campus forum on racial tolerance. </p>
<p>She was convicted of one misdemeanor count of filing a false police report and two felony counts of attempted insurance fraud. She faces up to 3 1/2 years in prison when she is sentenced Sept. 17.</p>
<p>Her attorney, Gary S. Lincenberg, issued a statement saying Dunn would appeal the attempted insurance fraud convictions.</p>
<p>The professor claimed her car was spray-painted and its tires slashed March 9. The report prompted college officials to cancel classes at Claremont&rsquo;s five undergraduate campuses the next day as thousands of students took part in demonstrations calling for tolerance.</p>
<p>Dunn called her insurance company that day to report the vandalism.</p>
<p>She became a suspect after two witnesses reported seeing her vandalizing her car. Investigators also said she gave them conflicting reports about what happened.</p>
<p>Dunn&rsquo;s attorney said the visiting professor never submitted a claim to her insurance company, adding the judge barred that evidence from being presented to the jury.</p>
<p>As for the false police report conviction, a Claremont College electrician identified a man who should have been the primary suspect, Lincenberg said.</p>
<p>Dunn, who remains on leave from Claremont McKenna College, maintains her innocence, he said.</p>
