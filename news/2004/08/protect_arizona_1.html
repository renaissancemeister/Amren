<h1>Protect Arizona Now Adviser Denies Racism Charge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yvonne Wingett, Arizona Republic, Aug. 7</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The anti-illegal-immigration group Protect Arizona Now has named a white supremacist to lead it&rsquo;s national operations, an anti-bigotry group charged on its Web site Friday.</p>
<p>In naming Virginia Abernethy a national adviser of PAN, the group has handed her a &ldquo;megaphone to promote racist views,&rdquo; charged the Center for New Community in a nine-page report and in interviews with The Arizona Republic.</p>
<p>Abernethy denied the allegation from her Nashville, Tenn. home. She&rsquo;s a separatist, not a racist, she said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge difference,&rdquo; said Abernethy, 69. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not saying anything about supremacy, not at all. We&rsquo;re saying that each ethnic group is often happier with its own kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Center for New Community based its label on Abernethy&rsquo;s role in what it described as &ldquo;several white supremacist organizations,&rdquo; including the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group that opposed the civil rights movement. Abernethy said she is on the advisory board for the CCC, which addresses constitutional issues, such as the Bill of Rights. The group&rsquo;s Web site promotes segregation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;With charges of racism already swirling around (PAN) &hellip;,&rdquo; the Chicago-based center&rsquo;s report read, the conservative group &ldquo;has taken the surprising step of choosing a leading figure in the white supremacist movement to chair its new national advisory board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abernethy, emeritus professor at Vanderbilt University, has advocated for population control through decreased immigration, and that&rsquo;s how the Center for New Community determined that she&rsquo;s a white supremacist, she said. </p>
<p>The group has resorted to name calling and spouting inflammatory propaganda, she said, because it has no valid arguments against the measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever an advocacy group for immigration is losing an argument, they call (us) the label of the day,&rdquo; Abernethy said. </p>
<p>PAN, also known as Proposition 200, would force Arizonans to prove their citizenship when registering to vote and to show identification when casting a ballot at the polls. It would also make it a crime for public employees to fail to report suspected undocumented immigrants seeking public benefits. </p>
<p>Organizers have filed 190,887 signatures with the Arizona Secretary of State on behalf of PAN; state elections officials are verifying if the group has the needed 122,612 valid signatures.</p>
<p>The initiative is not about racism or discrimination, supporters have said, but cutting taxpayers&rsquo; costs to accommodate undocumented residents. </p>
<p>Kathy McKee, PAN director, said her group would not involve a known racist. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve all been called that and it&rsquo;s really getting to be old.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;(Abernethy has) been considered the grande dame of the anti-immigration movement,&rdquo; McKee said. </p>
<p>The Center for New Community says Abernethy&rsquo;s involvement in the measure will introduce racist ideas to the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing such an important role in a ballot initiative like (PAN) helps legitimize white supremacists,&rdquo; said Devin Burghard, director of the group&rsquo;s building democracy initiative.</p>
