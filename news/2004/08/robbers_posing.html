<h1>Robbers Posing As Cops Prey On Recent Immigrants To Valley</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yvonne Wingett, Arizona Republic, Aug. 17</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Smooth-talking criminals posing as law enforcement agents are targeting Hispanics for robbery, especially recent immigrants, Phoenix authorities have warned Spanish-speaking residents.</p>
<p>The pseudo cops have struck three times across the city, robbing drivers and residents, according to Phoenix police reports and officers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We think there&rsquo;s more victims out there, but people are afraid to call the police,&rdquo; said Detective Icela Brown, of Silent Witness Inc. &ldquo;It could be because they&rsquo;re not here legally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brandishing a state Department of Public Safety-style badge, two men earlier this summer pulled over a driver near 35th Avenue south of Bethany Home Road. The imposter searched the victim, robbed him and took him to Phoenix Baptist Hospital for &ldquo;fingerprinting,&rdquo; according to a police report. </p>
<p>In a June 29 incident, another victim was robbed by two Latinos claiming to be officers driving an unmarked car. After pulling over the victims with a rotating roof light, the suspects robbed the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guy took their wallet and then they took off,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t normally ask for wallets. We&rsquo;ll ask for driver&rsquo;s licenses, registration and insurance.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In another instance, three men were dressed in black shirts resembling those worn by FBI agents, Brown said. They ordered everyone down and again demanded money.</p>
<p>The crimes are perpetuating distrust of public safety officials among recent arrivals from Mexico and South America, authorities said. That frustrates police because it has been a challenge to persuade immigrants to report crimes.</p>
