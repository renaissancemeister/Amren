<h1>Feds Nab 64 Convicted Alien Sexual Predators</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nina Pineda, WABC (NY), Aug. 18</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Authorities in New York City today went out in force, grabbing convicted sexual predators off the streets. They say many of those arrested may not even belong in the country. </p>
<p>Nina Pineda reports from Lower Manhattan. </p>
<p>These convicted child molesters were made a priority for deportation because of the risk they pose to the general public. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security characterized the individuals arrested as the worst of the worst. </p>
<p>The pedophiles were surprised by the federal agents who slapped handcuffs on 64 convicted sex offenders in total &mdash; 63 men, and one woman. They will now be deported back to 19 countries. </p>
<p>Martin Ficke, Department of Homeland Security: &ldquo;When you look at the crimes they&rsquo;ve been convicted of, it&rsquo;s senseless and mind-boggling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The offenses &mdash; rape, sodomy, sexual abuse &mdash; all involve sex acts with children, most of the time their own. Sometimes the child of a family friend. </p>
<p>Hector Benitez, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no description of a predator, he looks like you and I. He could be your nextdoor neighbor. There&rsquo;s not a signal for predators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Operation Predator is a nationwide Homeland Security initiative with Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement agents in all 50 states protecting kids from criminal alien sex offenders. Twenty of the offenders were in this country illegally, 47 had green cards. </p>
<p>All were convicted, yet placed on probation. None served any jail time until now. They&rsquo;re being held without bail, before being returned to their home countries.</p>
<p>John Ulianko, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement: &ldquo;I think it is a form of terrorism  &hellip;  how does the family members, when they find out about this. It is a form of terrorism, in which all law enforcement agencies have to combine and work together to make the homeland safe. And I think removing these peoples from the streets makes New York City, makes New York, makes the United States a little safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agents looked for 67 individuals today, and were able to arrest 64 people, and they have leads for two of the others. Except for a man named Kingsley Patterson, from Grenada. He is wanted for sexual offenses against a minor. Anyone with information is asked to contact with the ICE.</p>
