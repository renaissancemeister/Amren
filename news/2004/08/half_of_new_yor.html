<h1><a href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=855">Half of New Yorkers Believe US Leaders Had Foreknowledge of 9-11</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zogby News, Aug. 30</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the eve of a Republican National Convention invoking 9/11 symbols, sound bytes and imagery, half (49.3%) of New York City residents and 41% of New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders &ldquo;knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act,&rdquo; according to the poll conducted by Zogby International. The poll of New York residents was conducted from Tuesday August 24 through Thursday August 26, 2004. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of +/-3.5.</p>
<p>The poll is the first of its kind conducted in America that surveys attitudes regarding US government complicity in the 9/11 tragedy. Despite the acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and over 38% of those who described themselves as &ldquo;very conservative&rdquo; supported the claim.</p>
<p>The charge found very high support among adults under 30 (62.8%), African-Americans (62.5%), Hispanics (60.1%), Asians (59.4%), and &ldquo;Born Again&rdquo; Evangelical Christians (47.9%).</p>
<p>Less than two in five (36%) believe that the 9/11 Commission had &ldquo;answered all the important questions about what actually happened on September 11th,&rdquo; and two in three (66%) New Yorkers (and 56.2% overall) called for another full investigation of the &ldquo;still unanswered questions&rdquo; by Congress or Elliot Spitzer, New York&rsquo;s Attorney General. Self-identified &ldquo;very liberal&rdquo; New Yorkers supported a new inquiry by a margin of three to one, but so did half (53%) of &ldquo;very conservative&rdquo; citizens across the state. The call for a deeper probe was especially strong from Hispanics (75.6%), African-Americans (75.3%) citizens with income from $15-25K (74.3%), women (62%) and Evangelicals (59.9%).</p>
<p>W. David Kubiak, executive director of 911truth.org, the group that commissioned the poll, expressed genuine surprise that New Yorkers&rsquo; belief in the administration&rsquo;s complicity is as high or higher than that seen overseas. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re familiar with high levels of 9/11 skepticism abroad where there has been open debate of the evidence for US government complicity. On May 26th the Toronto Star reported a national poll showing that 63% of Canadians are also convinced US leaders had &lsquo;prior knowledge&rsquo; of the attacks yet declined to act. There was no US coverage of this startling poll or the facts supporting the Canadians&rsquo; conclusions, and there has been virtually no debate on the victim families&rsquo; scores of still unanswered questions. I think these numbers show that most New Yorkers are now fed up with the silence, and that politicians trying to exploit 9/11 do so at their peril. The 9/11 case is not closed and New York&rsquo;s questions are not going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas Levis of NY911truth.org, an advisor on the poll, agrees, &ldquo;The 9/11 Commission gave us a plenty of &lsquo;recommendations&rsquo;, but far more plentiful were the discrepancies, gaps and omissions in their supposedly &lsquo;final&rsquo; report. How can proposals based on such deficient findings ever make us safe? We think these poll numbers are basically saying, &lsquo;Wait just a minute. What about the scores of still outstanding questions? What about the unexplained collapses of WTC 7, our air defenses, official accountability, the chain of command on 9/11, the anthrax, insider trading &amp; FBI field probes? There&rsquo;s so much more to this story that we need to know about.&rsquo; When such a huge majority of New Yorkers want a new investigation, it will be interesting to see how quickly Attorney General Spitzer and our legislators respond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SCOPE: The poll covered five areas of related interest: 1) Iraq &mdash; do New Yorkers think that our leaders &ldquo;deliberately misled&rdquo; us before the war (51.2% do); 2) the 9/11 Commission &mdash; did it answer all the &ldquo;important questions&rdquo; (only 36% said yes); 3) the inexplicable and largely unreported collapse of the third WTC skyscraper on 9/11 &mdash; what was its number (28% of NYC area residents knew); 4) the question on complicity; and 5) how many wanted a new 9/11 probe. All inquiries about questions, responses and demographics should be directed to Zogby International.</p>
