<h1>Police See Surge In Gang Attacks Using Machetes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, WHDH-TV (Boston), Aug. 16</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BOSTON &mdash; Police say they are seeing a surge in the number of gang-related attacks involving machetes, the huge knives that are a ubiquitous tool in rural Latin America, with blades as thick as an axe and nearly as long as a sword.</p>
<p>The troubling trend has led some departments to crack down on machetes, and not just in urban areas. Some suburban communities have also enacted new laws to ban the knives. </p>
<p>Last month, during a sweep of gang members in Boston, Lynn, Revere, Chelsea, Everett and Somerville, police seized not just machetes, but more exotic weapons, including Chinese throwing stars and a Japanese metal chain whip. </p>
<p>But machetes, which can be easily obtained at garden stores or over the Internet, are by far the most popular of the alternative weapons. </p>
<p>The surge in machete attacks has gained less attention than recent gun-related homicides in Boston parks, despite a spate of attacks that have left at least four Massachusetts men hospitalized this spring and summer from machete wounds. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be that machetes are the weapon of choice,&rdquo; Detective Brian Kyes, a spokesman for the Chelsea Police, told The Boston Globe. &ldquo;In the past couple of years, we&rsquo;ve confiscated at least 50 machetes that have been used in crimes in the city.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Some Hispanic community leaders say the use of machetes in crime has tarnished the image of a useful tool used to cut sugarcane or clear underbrush. </p>
<p>&ldquo;For people in El Salvador, the machete is not looked at as a weapon,&rdquo; said Luis Morales, who grew up in El Salvador. He is now the pastor at the Vida Real Evangelical Center in Somerville. </p>
<p>Members of Boston&rsquo;s Hispanic community often hang machetes on living room walls as a reminder of home or gardening. </p>
<p>Some say they are dismayed that the machete is increasing being seen a weapon. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What about baseball bats? They are also used in gang-related attacks. Even a shoe can be considered a weapon if someone uses it to hit someone else,&rdquo; Morales said.</p>
