			<h1>
				City Engineer Accused of Racist Comments 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>News4Jax.com, Mar. 29</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				JACKSONVILLE, Fla. &mdash; City officials say a city engineer who was fed up with &ldquo;stupid questions&rdquo; from contractors made comments that some are calling racist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				City engineers oversee many projects in Jacksonville, and questions from contractors are typical. But questions from B.A. Wilson, the minority contracting company building a park on the Westside, were met with hostility. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bernard Wilson, who owns the company, said when they asked a question about the blueprints, he could not believe the answer he got from a city engineer. The reply read, &ldquo;You people are asking too many stupid questions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to some, the phrase &ldquo;you people&rdquo; has very negative connotations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;You people&rsquo; has a history of being a discriminatory remark, and that is how Mr. Wilson took it,&rdquo; said attorney Robin Roberts (pictured, left), who&rsquo;s representing Wilson. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The engineer, Bobby Henderson, also wrote in his reply that he had too many projects to manage and &ldquo;not enough time to waste on your uninformed questions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I could not believe a city official would actually put something like this in writing,&rdquo; said Roberts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Other city officials couldn&rsquo;t believe it either. Ed Hall, a deputy director for the Public Works Department, said the comments were unprofessional, but not racist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We pride ourselves in being very professional with our contractors and contract-related issues. Unfortunately, Mr. Henderson did not do a very good job of that and has since apologized,&rdquo; Hall said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a copy of the apology obtained by Eyewitness News, Henderson says, &ldquo;I would like to apologize for any comments that may have been harshly made in my responses back to you. These comments were not intended to be a personal attack on your company or your company&rsquo;s employees. It was simply me expressing my frustration with what I consider to be issues or questions that were extremely elementary.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Roberts&rsquo; company has not yet seen the apology. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Well, right now nothing has happened,&rdquo; explained Roberts. &ldquo;We are waiting for a response from the city and we are going to go from there.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, some council members are wondering if further action should be taken. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very distasteful to me for you to say &lsquo;you people,&rsquo; but the city has to deal with this type of situation,&rdquo; said Councilwoman Pat Lockett-Felder. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The contractor is now demanding an investigation into this and other problems they say they&rsquo;re having with the city.
