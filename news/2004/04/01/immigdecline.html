				Illegal Immigration Said to Be Declining  
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Suzanne Gamboa, AP, Mar. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WASHINGTON &mdash; Illegal immigration appears to be declining as the United States takes better control of its borders, the head of the Customs and Border Protection Bureau said Tuesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Arrests of illegal immigrants have been declining in recent years, and those figures generally serve as a measuring stick for estimating illegal entries, said Commissioner Robert Bonner. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are, I believe, getting control over our border,&rdquo; Bonner told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee for homeland security. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His depiction of border security contrasted with the view of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who said illegal immigration is out of control. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are losing the war against illegal aliens,&rdquo; Shelby said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, the Border Patrol logged 931,557 arrests. That compares with 955,310 arrests in 2002 and 1.3 million arrests in 2001. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bonner said the &ldquo;marginal decline&rdquo; in illegal immigration has resulted from increased enforcement along segments of the Texas and California borders and better equipment to help agents detect illegal migrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since October, however, arrests have been rising, to 502,000 over roughly the past six months, compared with 426,853 during the same period a year ago, said Gloria Chavez, a spokeswoman for the bureau, part of the Homeland Security Department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When Shelby asked whether the challenge of controlling illegal immigration is too great, Bonner responded, &ldquo;We can do this.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				President Bush has requested $64 million to develop and obtain more technology to assist with border protection. Another $10 million has been requested to develop and deploy unmanned aerial vehicles, essentially drones, that would look out for illegal border crossers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By late spring or early summer, the agency hopes to deploy some of the drones along the Arizona border, where arrests have risen recently. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bonner said Bush&rsquo;s proposal for a temporary worker program could relieve some of the illegal immigration pressure on the border. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bush has proposed allowing legal and illegal immigrants to work in the country under renewable three-year permits. The legislation is given little chance of being enacted in this election year.
