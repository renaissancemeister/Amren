			<p>
				AMSTERDAM &mdash; Seven out of 10 native Dutch believe the Netherlands has its own culture, but a majority of these people believe the nation&rsquo;s cultural identity is threatened and that immigrants must be compelled to learn the language and local culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 75 percent of native Dutch people who took part in a TNO/Nipo survey said the Netherlands had its own specific culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Queen&rsquo;s Day, Sinterklaas and skating are three of the main trademark symbols of Dutch culture, according to a survey to be featured on the KRO Reporter television programme on Wednesday night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some 85 percent of this group said Dutch culture was &ldquo;very important&rdquo; for them. Some 86 percent said they were personally proud to be Dutch, newspaper Trouw reported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				People of Surinamese and Antillean origins were slightly less proud of Dutch culture &mdash; 67 percent and 69 percent respectively. Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles were colonised by the Dutch. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Respondents from the other two main national groups in the Netherlands, Moroccans and Turks at 52 percent and 54 percent were even less positive about Dutch culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some 66 percent of native Dutch and 42 percent of newcomers said Dutch culture was at risk. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among Dutch people, 27 percent singled out immigration as the greatest threat, 16 percent blamed failing integration and 18 percent pointed the finger at the EU. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigrants opted instead to blame poor upbringing/education (20 percent). Integration failures came in second place on 15 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some 60 percent of Dutch people feel that newcomers should be forced to learn the Dutch culture and language and about half said the Dutch border should be sealed to new immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Reporters programme (in Dutch) is on Nederland 1 at 11.15pm on Wednesday. Click <a href="https://www.expatica.com/source/forum_thread.asp?channel_id=1&amp;thread_id=5723&amp;top">here</a> to take part in a discussion on Dutch culture on Expatica&rsquo;s Forums.
