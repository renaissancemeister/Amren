			<h1>
				&lsquo;I&rsquo;m Fascinated by Hip-Hop,&rsquo; Says Prez Candidate John Kerry 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Rich Rock, SOHH.com, Mar. 31</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fascinated by Rap and Hip-Hop&rdquo; said Democratic presidential candidate, <b>John Kerry</b> during an MTV Choose or Lose forum. Offering up a heavy dose of street credibility, Kerry defended gangsta rap, freedom of speech and the realities of street life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kerry spoke with MTV&rsquo;s Gideon Yago and took questions from the audience last night in MTV&rsquo;s annual Choose or Lose forum. The youth voting movement this year endeavors to get 20 million new voters to the polls and impact what is projected to be a tight presidential race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Boston-born heir by marriage to the Heinz Ketchup fortune, offered his perspective on rap music as the voice of the streets. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of poetry in it. There&rsquo;s a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you&rsquo;d better listen to it pretty carefully, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				When questioned about offensive rap lyrics, Kerry said there is a line to be drawn, but defended freedom of speech. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think that there is a line you draw between government intervention and the right of speech and the right for people to express themselves, but do I think there are standards of decency in that? Yes, I do. Do I think that sometimes some lyrics in some songs have stepped over what I consider to be a reasonable line? Yeah, I do. I think when you start talking about killing cops or something like that, it bothers me.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Calling rap a &ldquo;reflection of life&rdquo;, Kerry empathized with the struggles reflected in the music. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still listening because I know that it&rsquo;s a reflection of the street and it&rsquo;s a reflection of life, and I understand all that. I&rsquo;m not for the government censoring or stepping in. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s inappropriate occasionally to talk about what you think is a standard or what you think is a value that is worth trying to live up to.&rdquo;
