			<h1>
				Former Rep. Barrett Wins Milwaukee Mayor Race 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>FoxNews.com, Apr. 7</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				MILWAUKEE &mdash; Former U.S. Rep. <b>Tom Barrett</b> (<a href="https://clickit.go2net.com/search?cid=307797&amp;site=srch&amp;area=is.clicktracking&amp;shape=link&amp;cp=info.foxnws&amp;clickurl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.foxnews.com%2Finfo.foxnws%2Fredirs_all.htm%3Fpgtarg%3Dwbsdogpile&amp;ext_qcat=web&amp;ext_qkw=Tom%20Barrett">search</a>) ended acting Mayor <b>Marvin Pratt&rsquo;s</b> (<a href="https://clickit.go2net.com/search?cid=307797&amp;site=srch&amp;area=is.clicktracking&amp;shape=link&amp;cp=info.foxnws&amp;clickurl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.foxnews.com%2Finfo.foxnws%2Fredirs_all.htm%3Fpgtarg%3Dwbsdogpile&amp;ext_qcat=web&amp;ext_qkw=Marvin%20Pratt%27s">search</a>) dream of becoming the city&rsquo;s first elected black mayor, winning a bitter contest marked by racial divisions and accusations of campaign finance violations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In speeches delivered after results were in late Tuesday night, Barrett and Pratt both talked about the need to bring the community back together. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have to remember our diversity is our greatest strength,&rdquo; said Barrett, who won with about 54 percent of the vote. &ldquo;I will unite our community.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pratt, who got about 46 percent, told supporters they too have to work to bridge Milwaukee&rsquo;s racial divide. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is not the end of me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is the beginning of a new campaign, of a new crusade.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The election became bitter after the February primary when reports surfaced about problems in Pratt&rsquo;s campaign finance reports. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He accused the media of unfair coverage. After civil charges were filed against him, he said the investigation was politically motivated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pratt, who ran on the slogan &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Time,&rdquo; was charged last week with four civil counts of filing a false campaign finance report and another of failing to deposit personal campaign contributions in a campaign account. He faces a forfeiture of $2,500, which he said he will pay. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The primary reflected the city&rsquo;s racial division, with blacks coming out in support of Pratt, and whites and Hispanics for Barrett, who is white. Milwaukee&rsquo;s population is 50 percent white, 37 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic and 4 percent other groups, census figures show. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About 47 percent of voters turned out Tuesday, a bit less than expected, said Julietta Henry, executive director of Milwaukee&rsquo;s City Election Commission. She said the highest turnout was in two areas where the majority of residents are white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Barrett repeatedly tried to use the investigation to his benefit, saying Pratt couldn&rsquo;t be trusted with a $1 billion budget. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pratt admitted to carelessness in campaign finances and said he accepted responsibility for the mistakes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pratt became acting mayor in January when Mayor <b>John Norquist</b> (<a href="https://clickit.go2net.com/search?cid=307797&amp;site=srch&amp;area=is.clicktracking&amp;shape=link&amp;cp=info.foxnws&amp;clickurl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.foxnews.com%2Finfo.foxnws%2Fredirs_all.htm%3Fpgtarg%3Dwbsdogpile&amp;ext_qcat=web&amp;ext_qkw=John%20Norquist">search</a>) left four months early after 16 years as mayor for a job in Chicago in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal and an admission that he had an extramarital affair. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pratt has been an alderman of a largely black district since 1987. Barrett served five terms in Congress before leaving in 2002 when he made an unsuccessful bid for governor.
