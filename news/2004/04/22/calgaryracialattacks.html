				<a href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/CalgarySun/News/2004/04/17/425600.html">Cops Fear Racial Pot Is Boiling</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Melissa Ridgen, Calgary Sun (Canada), Apr. 17 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spate of racial attacks among teens, including a recent stabbing, has cops bracing for a bloody &mdash; possibly deadly &mdash; fallout. A 14-year-old Lebanese teen was stabbed in the head and neck by a white teenage boy after a verbal dispute between the two Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Rundle LRT station. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The victim &ldquo;is lucky to be alive,&rdquo; according to District 5 Det. Gord Robertson, who is concerned about a racial pot that&rsquo;s reached the boiling point. &ldquo;The victim is well-known to us as being involved in these kinds of racial incidents and there&rsquo;s a history between (him and his attacker),&rdquo; Robertson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The victim is being unco-operative in our investigation and we&rsquo;re expecting some sort of retaliatory action.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police obviously can&rsquo;t predict when and where, and Robertson fears they won&rsquo;t know until it&rsquo;s too late. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Since the New Year we&rsquo;ve seen a surprising number of incidents of conflict among adolescents along racial lines,&rdquo; Robertson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Iraqi, Lebanese and Afghan teens &mdash; mostly male, between age 14 and 18 &mdash; have aligned themselves in conflict with both white and East Indian teens, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The result have been violent conflicts, often involving weapons. The disturbances occur in places where teens congregate such as schools, malls, LRT stations, and often in spots predetermined by teens for organizing fights between factions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re worried it&rsquo;s going to get worse. There seems to be so many weapons of opportunity involved in these attacks and there might not be a planned and deliberate murder, but it&rsquo;s our fear that sooner or later, that will be the end result of one of these incidents,&rdquo; Robertson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The suspect in Thursday&rsquo;s aggravated assault is a white male, 15 to 17 years old, 5-ft.-6 to 5-ft.-10, with a slim build and blond hair. He was wearing a black cap or toque with green stitching, a black jacket, and blue jeans.
