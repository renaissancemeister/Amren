			<h1>
				Berkeley Chancellor: Admissions Figures &lsquo;Unacceptable&rsquo;
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>foxreno.com, Apr. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				BERKELEY, Calif. &mdash; For the first time in more than 40 years, the University of California will not be able to accept all eligible in-state freshmen for the upcoming fall term. 
			</p>
			<p>
				State budget cuts have forced the prestigious system to turn away thousands of qualified students this year, reducing admissions by nearly 7 percent from last fall. Meanwhile, black admissions dropped 15 percent, worrying administrators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an area of great concern for us,&rdquo; said Susan Wilbur, UC&rsquo;s director of undergraduate admissions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wilbur, who called the 2004 admissions process a difficult year for students and the university, said officials are &ldquo;certainly hoping that this situation is temporary and that we will be able to resume finding a place for all UC-eligible students in the very near future.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This year&rsquo;s admissions decisions came amid financial crisis. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has asked UC to cut enrollment by 3,200 students, offering those students a guarantee of transferring as juniors if they go to community college for the first two years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, controversy has been brewing over how UC students are admitted. The chairman of UC&rsquo;s governing board of regents, John Moores, has accused flagship Berkeley of discrimination under UC&rsquo;s two-year-old system of &ldquo;comprehensive review&rdquo; admissions, which takes socio-economic factors as academics into account. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, Moores wrote a report based on 2002 data in which he criticized Berkeley for turning away thousands of students with high SAT scores while accepting several hundred students with low scores. Many of the lower-scoring students were black or Hispanic, underrepresented minorities at UC, causing Moores and others to question whether UC was skirting a state ban on affirmative action in college admissions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Tuesday, Chancellor Robert Berdahl issued a statement calling the 2004 admissions figures for his campus &ldquo;flat-out unacceptable.&rdquo; Berdahl, who is retiring at the end of the school year, said he will spend the rest of his term trying to find ways to increase the number of underrepresented students who apply. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All major ethnic groups saw declines in admissions and looking at overall totals, blacks, Hispanics and American Indians increased very slightly as a proportion of overall admits, from 19.8 percent last year to 20 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the actual number of underrepresented minorities admitted was down, particularly for black students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wilbur said applications from black students were also down, a trend reflected nationally. She said explanations are still being sought for the decline, but may include fee hikes and cuts in recruitment programs. Wilbur said there was no way to know whether controversy over the Moores&rsquo; report discouraged some minorities from applying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At Berkeley, 211 black students were admitted for fall, down about 29 percent from last year&rsquo;s 298. For Hispanics, the decline was about 7 percent, from 1,030 last year to 955. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I am profoundly saddened and disappointed that so many of these students, especially African American students, will not receive the exceptional education and experience that this public institution has to offer,&rdquo; Berdahl said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have to think about new strategies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We understand the will of California voters, that admissions should not include racial preferences, but I cannot believe the will of the voters would be to deny us the right to provide targeted programs to prepare more underrepresented students for admission to Berkeley.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				For all eight undergraduate UC campuses, the figures released Tuesday, which are admissions offers, not actual enrollment, include 7,600 guaranteed transfer offers. Overall, just under 47,000 state residents were offered freshman admission to UC this fall compared to more than 50,000 last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An additional 2,661 students were offered delayed admission for the winter or spring terms and 1,120 students who didn&rsquo;t get into the engineering programs they applied to were offered the chance to study engineering at UC Riverside.
