				<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1196973,00.html">Pro-Stoning Imam Faces Expulsion</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jon Henley, The Guardian (UK), Apr. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The French justice minister yesterday ordered the expulsion of an Algerian-born Lyon imam who declared he was in favour of women being stoned, wives being beaten and France becoming an Islamist republic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dominique de Villepin said he wanted the repatriation order against Abdelkader Bouziane implemented immediately &ldquo;as a public order measure aimed at protecting the national interest&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The minister said: &ldquo;The government cannot tolerate remarks being made, in public, that run counter to human rights and human dignity.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Bouziane, the imam of the al-Forquan mosque in the largely immigrant suburb of V&eacute;nisseux, said in an interview with Lyon Mag this weekend that the Koran authorised husbands to hit their wives, &ldquo;but not just anywhere &hellip; not on the face, but on the legs or stomach. And he can strike hard, to frighten her off reoffending.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also said that he was in favour of polygamy, that women should not be allowed to share a workplace with men because &ldquo;they could be tempted into adultery&rdquo;, and that music was a sin. Asked whether he approved of women being stoned, he replied: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The moderate Muslim Council condemned his remarks.
