			<h1>
				Hamtramck May Approve Muslim Prayer Call
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Longtime residents say proposal is affront to city 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Ron French, Detroit News, Apr. 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>HAMTRAMCK </b> &mdash;  Along with pierogi and paczki, Hamtramck may soon be known for its Islamic calls to worship. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The City Council is expected today to pass a noise ordinance amendment permitting mosques to issue the traditional call to prayer over loud speakers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s another sign of change in this traditionally Polish community of 23,000, which has become a magnet for immigrants of all colors and creeds in recent years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For decades, Hamtramck has been predominantly Polish. But in recent years, store signs in Polish have been joined by signs written in Bengali and Arabic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the request by the Bangladeshi al-Islah mosque for permission to air the Arabic call to prayer via loudspeakers five times a day has revealed tensions among the groups. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They can believe whatever they want to, but I&rsquo;m against them pushing their content into my head like brainwashing,&rdquo; said Joanne Golen, 68, a lifelong Hamtramck resident. &ldquo;There are seven mosques in the city, and I&rsquo;ll be in the middle of all of them.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The five daily calls to worship last about two minutes. The recorded calls are broadcast over loudspeakers at mosques in Dearborn, which has one of the largest concentrations of Arab-Americans in the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people in the city of Hamtramck are going to be annoyed,&rdquo; said Imad Hamad, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, based in Dearborn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a loud noise.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the calls to worship are in Arabic, Golen said she&rsquo;s offended by words that praise Allah. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my true God,&rdquo; Golen said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay locked in my house with cotton in my ears every time they do it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Hamtramck should live up to freedom of religion and religious expression, and celebrate our rich diversity and tolerance,&rdquo; Hamad said.
