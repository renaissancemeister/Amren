				<a href="https://www.startribune.com/stories/389/4732525.html">ICE Officials Frustrated With &lsquo;Bad Guy&rsquo; Image</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Kristin Tillotson, startribune.com (Minneapolis), Apr. 22</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents say they are frustrated at being portrayed as bad guys, when they often go out of their way to be generous to potential deportees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We get painted in this bad light, but in reality our role is much more supportive,&rdquo; said Scott Baniecke, field office director for the regional office in Bloomington, which oversees Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. &ldquo;We get thank-you notes from people who have been deported, thanking us for treating them kindly.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The legal terminology for deportation is now &ldquo;removal.&rdquo; Congress in 1996 combined two procedures, deportation and exclusion. The number of people in the five-state area who have been found in violation of the law and in the removal process is about 13,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Baniecke and ICE spokesman Tim Counts cite instances in which they have stretched legal limits to accommodate a deportee&rsquo;s circumstances &mdash; such as releasing an eight-months-pregnant woman on her own recognizance, and giving people extra time to get their affairs in order. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Too often, he said, people forget that ICE agents are the enforcers, not the lawmakers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a perception that we have a huge amount of leeway in who we deport and who we don&rsquo;t depending on our mood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we are carrying out the orders of a judge, because we&rsquo;re obligated to. Every person who is removed has had full access to the due process of the law.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Bloomingotn ICE office also offers each detainee a chance to sit down with a lawyer before seeing a judge. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to get arrested for violating immigration law, do it here, because this is a strong pro bono state,&rdquo; Baniecke said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More than 75 percent of ICE arrests involve criminal behavior, Counts said. &ldquo;In reality, we don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to take on some of these noncriminal cases, but we have to abide by the courts&rsquo; decisions.&rdquo;
