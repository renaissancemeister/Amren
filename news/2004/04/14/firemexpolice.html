				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3621073.stm">Mexican State Sacks Entire Police</a> 
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Federal police have taken over security in central Mexico&rsquo;s Morelos state after a governor dismissed its entire police force. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Apr. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The state&rsquo;s 552 policemen were sacked after the arrest of two top officers for allegedly protecting a drugs gang. 
			</p>
			<p>
				State governor Sergio Estrada said all the policemen had handed back their weapons while each one&rsquo;s record in the job was being scrutinised. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The two officers are accused of helping the Juarez cartel smuggle cocaine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				State police chief Jose Augustine Montiel and his operations director, Raul Cortes, are being held on suspicion of cutting a deal with the gang, which gets its name from a town near the US border where it is apparently based. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Five other suspects &mdash; also state employees &mdash; are on the run. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prosecutors say planes ferrying cocaine from Colombia were allowed to land at an airport in Morelos state&rsquo;s capital, Cuernavaca. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They further allege that consignments of cocaine would leave the airport in police vehicles, before being sold. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Juarez cartel is said to be one of the country&rsquo;s major drug trafficking organisations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Lie-detector tests </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Morelos state&rsquo;s governor, Sergio Estrada, pledged to restructure the force to ensure officers were well-trained and respectful of ethics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said all new recruits to the force would face regular lie-detector tests, as well as drug and alcohol checks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mexico has a number of federal, state and local police forces. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Correspondents say police corruption is a serious problem.
