			<h1>
				Former El Monte &lsquo;Citizen of the Year&rsquo; Sentenced to Prison for Assaulting Family 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Associated Press, MercuryNews.com, Apr. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>POMONA, Calif. &mdash; </b>A man once named El Monte &ldquo;Citizen of the Year&rdquo; was sentenced Monday to 985 years to life in prison for assaulting his family last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rocky Sanchez, 36, was convicted last month on 41 felony charges, including rape of his wife and teenage stepdaughter, assault, attempted torture, aggravated mayhem and weapons-related counts. He was also convicted of a single misdemeanor count. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prosecutors said Sanchez began terrorizing his family last summer. He raped and repeatedly beat his wife after she confessed to having an affair near the end of the year, prosecutors said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Superior Court Judge Thomas Falls on Monday also added 17 years to the sentence, including 10 years for two prior felony convictions and another seven for weapons-related enhancements. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities said they found handguns, rifles, shotguns and at least one homemade cannon at Sanche&rsquo;Zs home. As a convicted felon, he was barred from owning a firearm. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1998, the El Monte City Council honored Sanchez for giving police a license plate number in a gang-related shooting and testifying in court against the suspected gunman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pomona is located about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and about 10 miles east of El Monte.
