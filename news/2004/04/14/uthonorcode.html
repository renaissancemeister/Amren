				<a href="http://www.collegiatenetwork.org/stp-perma.php?bid=179">Texas Students Oppose Recommendations by the Task Force on Racial Respect and Fairness</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Brian Bodine, The Collegiate Network, Mar. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A coalition of student groups at the University of Texas at Austin have united to oppose the major proposals of the Report of the Task Force on Racial Respect and Fairness [The Diversity Report], submitted to UT President Larry Faulkner in January, 2004. The student groups include the College Republicans, Contumacy, Students for American Values, Students for Academic Freedom, Young Conservatives of Texas, and the Students for a Colorblind America. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among the events planned to oppose the Report are a student panel on diversity and a rally on March 26th, which will be sponsored by The Students for American Values. Both events will raise questions about the Report&rsquo;s effects if its proposals are implemented. Other organizations in the coalition will be supporting the rally, which will include public speakers, and some students participating in the rally will burn copies of honor codes in a trash barrel in order to demonstrate their opposition to the Taskforce Report. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The recommendations opposed by the coalition include: (1) the return to race-conscious admissions and financial aid policies to increase the &ldquo;recruitment, retention, and advancement of historically underrepresented students, faculty, and staff;&rdquo; (2) A new required course relating to a &ldquo;non-U.S. Culture&rdquo; for all University undergraduates; (3) The required signing of affidavits pledging allegiance to a tolerance &ldquo;honor code&rdquo; by all admitted University freshmen; (4) The development of a new &ldquo;University standard of behavior&rdquo; regarding diversity issues for all registered student organizations which would publicly ostracize any student group that declined to officially endorse the University&rsquo;s codified &ldquo;diversity standard;&rdquo; and (5) the relocation of statues along the Main Mall to a &ldquo;more appropriate place.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Report proposes that the University &ldquo;establish a comprehensive &lsquo;Honor Code&rsquo; that addresses interpersonal as well as academic behavior.&rdquo; The Report also recommends that the University &ldquo;establish an &lsquo;Honor Council&rsquo; to include students, faculty, and staff who will oversee the enforcement of the proposed &lsquo;Honor Code.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The Honor Code provision of the report is incredibly vague and could prove disastrous for student organizations engaging in free speech. The taskforce has recommended that words such as &lsquo;fairness and respect for diversity&rsquo; be included in the Honor Code,&rdquo; said College Republicans at Texas Chairman Brian Bodine. &ldquo;Such terms are highly subjective, and being that UT has a mostly leftist faculty and student body, those terms might be incorrectly construed in order to condemn certain forms of political speech.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Although not quite the Inquisition, the honor council is surely the best way to intimidate students from saying anything remotely politically incorrect. Since when did the university adopt orthodoxy of thought? Who decided what speech is okay and what is heresy?&rdquo; said Brendan Steinhauser, Media Director of Students for Academic Freedom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Report also recommends that the University incorporate a &lsquo;University standing&rsquo; for student organizations registered at the University, which would be designed to inform parents and entering students of those organizations that do not meet the University standard of behavior. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Employing a diversity litmus test for all registered student groups automatically renders suspect student groups who oppose a return to racial quotas and race-conscious University policies,&rdquo; said Yehya Mohammed Gouda, an editor for Contumacy, a student journal for culture and politics at the University of Texas .&rdquo;The implementation of some of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations could have adverse effects on UT student groups with conservative ideologies.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the same lines, the Report proposes that the University &ldquo;notify incoming and prospective students that the application process requires the signing of an affidavit to be returned with their acceptance of admission. The affidavit will state that they must adhere to the principles of the &lsquo;Honor Code&rsquo; and understand the consequences of not abiding by them.&rdquo;
