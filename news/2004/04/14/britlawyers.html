				Immigration Lawyers Face Campaign of Fire-Bombing and Death Threats 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Robert Verkaik, independent.co.uk, Apr. 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lawyers representing asylum-seekers have had their offices fire-bombed in what police believe may be part of a racist terror campaign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Others have received death threats and hate mail while one firm has closed down its website after racist hackers broke into a secure area. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the worst incident so far, a south London law firm was fire-bombed after a series of break-ins in which the intruders daubed racist graffiti on office equipment. Russell Stanley, a firm with about 1,000 clients in Camberwell and Peckham, has had to temporarily shut its office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Emenike Mgbemena, 36, who runs the firm with eight colleagues, said he was in no doubt that the attack was related to work his firm did with asylum-seekers in the community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;First I received letters saying that Africans should go home, then they started breaking into the building and vandalising the equipment by pouring water over it and writing messages like &lsquo;Africa is shit&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mr Mgbemena, who came to Britain from Nigeria in 1989 and qualified as a solicitor six years ago, said that his practice was vital for asylum-seekers who lived in the area. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police are also investigating a complaint by a senior partner of an immigration law firm in north London who received a death threat. The caller said that he would be killed if he continued representing asylum-seekers. The victim, who is one of the Legal Services Commission&rsquo;s assessors for immigration work, said that he did not want to be named because he feared reprisals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In another case, Wesley Gryk, a north London immigration solicitor, has shown <i>The Independent</i> racist material sent to him by the British National Party (BNP) which calls on the public to &ldquo;fight the influx of asylum-seekers&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Solicitors working outside London have also been targeted by racists. Ruth Bundey, a leading immigration and human rights lawyer working in Leeds, received racist hate-mail after representing Asian families. She says that she has also been named by the racist website Redwatch. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Raj Joshi, of the Society of Black Lawyers, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrific that in this day and age we are having to deal with this kind of racist offence. Immigration lawyers represent some of the most vulnerable people in our society and must be protected from this kind of violence.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that officers were investigating the fire-bombing and continuing to monitor the situation. 
			</p>
			<h1>
				Immigration Advisers To Be Set Ethics Tests 
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				In the second of a new series on racial tensions spreading in Britain, Robert Verkaik reports on the crackdown on abuse of legal aid 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>independent.co.uk, Apr. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				All immigration lawyers are to undergo strict new checks in a bid to weed out unscrupulous ones who take on clients who have no reasonable hope of winning asylum in Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the tests to be announced today, solicitors will engage in role-playing exercises to show them how to spot bogus asylum-seekers and give advice. Solicitors who fail or who are shown to be unscrupulous or incompetent will be excluded from practising under the legal aid scheme. The assessments, which include tests on immigration procedure, law, and ethics, are part of a wider clampdown on abuses of the &pound;174m-a-year legal aid system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Crispin Passmore, head of immigration services at the Legal Services Commission, which has joint responsibility with the Law Society for the compulsory assessments, said: &ldquo;We must make sure the public has confidence in the system and solicitors are not just making money out of vulnerable people.&rdquo; A private company would perform the tests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				From April 2005, the commission will require all advisers working in immigration &mdash; solicitors and non-solicitors -to pass the tests. Accreditation will consist of three levels: accredited caseworker, senior caseworker and advanced caseworker. Advanced-level advisers with high levels of knowledge and skills will earn a 5 per cent rise. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Janet Paraskeva, the Law Society&rsquo;s chief executive, said: &ldquo;We are determined to identify and root out poor-quality advisers taking advantage of the system.&rdquo; Clare Dodgson, chief executive of the Legal Services Commission, said: &ldquo;Legal aid should be a first-rate service that offers quality advice to people in need. It is also about rewarding those who drive up standards for immigrants and asylum-seekers, who are frequently forced to flee oppressive situations in their home countries.&rdquo;Last month a senior judge attacked lawyers who string out legal appeals for failed asylum-seekers to keep them in Britain as long as possible. Mr Justice Collins accused them of &ldquo;delaying the inevitable&rdquo; by leaving it to the last minute to lodge appeals and requests for legal aid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are concerns that the legal system is being widely abused. Even asylum-seekers with the most hopeless cases cannot be deported until they have exhausted the lengthy appeal process.
