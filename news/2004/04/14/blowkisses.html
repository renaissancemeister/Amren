				Killer Blows Kisses at Victim&rsquo;s Family 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Alan Gomez, Palm Beach Post, Apr. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				WEST PALM BEACH &mdash; Before Octavious Wade was escorted out of a downtown courtroom Tuesday, he sent one last message to the family of the 17-year-old boy he killed with a gunshot to the face. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wade blew them two kisses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It took a deputy to control the ensuing chaos, as the boy&rsquo;s stepfather went after Wade and deputies rushed Wade out of the courtroom. But the brief scene showed the kind of emotions family members were trying to avoid by accepting a plea bargain for Wade instead of going to trial on a charge of first-degree murder. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I hope this animal burns in hell,&rdquo; the dead boy&rsquo;s mother, Jamie Lauter, said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wade, 21, faced a life term in prison &mdash; or the death penalty &mdash; on one count of first-degree murder with a firearm and five counts of robbery with a firearm. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and the robbery charges in exchange for a 40-year prison term. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He must serve a minimum of 25 years in prison, then must serve at least 85 percent of the remaining 15 years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wade was arrested on Feb. 26, 2001, in connection with a store holdup. But after he confessed to the robbery and several others, investigators said Wade, without any prompting, also confessed to killing Royal Palm Beach High School senior Aaron Lauter, 17. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wade said he and a friend, Lawrence Walker, both had guns when they got into Lauter&rsquo;s car to sell him a pound of marijuana. They then stole the $500 Lauter had brought for the marijuana, took his pager and wallet and ordered the teen out of the car. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s when Wade said Walker told him to &ldquo;go ahead and do it,&rdquo; and Wade shot Lauter in the face before driving off. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Walker also was arrested, but was later released. Prosecutor Terri Skiles said Tuesday they could not successfully prosecute him because the only piece of evidence against Walker was the testimony of Wade &mdash; a co-defendant already facing a slew of felony charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Skiles said Wade&rsquo;s actions leaving the courtroom Tuesday proved to her that she made the right choice because the boy&rsquo;s fragile mother couldn&rsquo;t have handled that level of emotion throughout a lengthy trial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wade&rsquo;s attorney, Bert Winkler, called Wade&rsquo;s actions an &ldquo;emotion of the moment that should not be taken sincerely&rdquo; and that he has expressed remorse for the shooting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Lauter&rsquo;s family did not agree. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After Wade blew them kisses, the boy&rsquo;s stepfather, Eric Ott, jumped out of his seat and tried to attack Wade. Jamie Lauter bear-hugged him, trying to hold him back as a bailiff drew his Taser gun and ordered him to sit down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After several yells and curses, Ott finally did settle down as Jamie Lauter clenched him in her arms and softly repeated: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
