				Tax Rap Is &lsquo;Murder&rsquo;
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Murray Weiss, NY Post, Apr. 28</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				IT&rsquo;S the biggest empire in rap music &mdash; and it&rsquo;s headed for a major fall. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal prosecutors are set to indict hip-hop impresario Irv (Lorenzo) Gotti &mdash; the founder of the powerful Murder Inc. label, who boasts superstar clients like Ja Rule and Ashanti &mdash; on tax charges, law-enforcement sources told The Post. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lorenzo, who changed his name to Gotti in admiration for Gambino family crime boss John Gotti, is expected to soon be hit with charges involving million-dollar tax-evasion schemes, the sources said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the charges &mdash; expected to be made public in the next few weeks &mdash; would be only the tip of the iceberg in the feds&rsquo; overall case against Gotti and his close pal, notorious imprisoned drug kingpin Kenneth &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo; McGriff, sources said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Probers are also looking at: 
			</p>
			<p>
				* As many as nine murders, including several here. Those slayings range from the 1995 execution of a 33-year-old convicted murderer and drug dealer outside a Jamaica, Queens, sports bar, to the 2003 slaying of an up-and-coming rapper who had signed a contract with Murder Inc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				* Whether the nation&rsquo;s largest hip-hop label was launched with proceeds from McGriff&rsquo;s murderous drug empire.

			<p>
				Gotti and McGriff &mdash; boyhood chums from Hollis, Queens &mdash; as well as Gotti&rsquo;s brother, Christopher, are in the crosshairs of Brooklyn federal prosecutors and agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as the IRS. 
			</p>
			<p>
				* Allegations involving at least two New York lawyers who were used to win bail set for a suspected drug courier caught with two kilos in North Carolina in 2001. The courier was assassinated in Maryland along with a cohort just days later. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a highly unusual step, prosecutors called one of the lawyers in front of a grand jury to testify in the case. The prosecutors wanted to make sure the lawyers had not been aware of the assassination plot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				* A lifelong friend of both Gotti and McGriff, who reportedly once told the feds that he was a strong-arm collector for Murder Inc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The man &mdash; Tyran &ldquo;Ta-Ta&rdquo; Moore, the ex-lover of Sandi &ldquo;Pepa&rdquo; Denton of the hit group Salt &lsquo;N&rsquo; Pepa &mdash; later denied he made the incriminating remark. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the tax case, the feds are zeroing in on allegations that Murder Inc. failed to report revenues from the sale of concert-related items such as tickets, promotional advertisements, T-shirts, hats and CDs from its wildly successful stable of artists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gotti, in his 30s, also allegedly doled out hundreds of thousands of dollars in unreported &ldquo;salary&rdquo; and corporate expenses to McGriff, 42, during the time the crack-cocaine czar was freed from jail in the mid 1990s. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McGriff&rsquo;s perks included access to free flights &ldquo;throughout the country,&rdquo; stays at posh Four Seasons hotels and even a $1,200 limousine ride while he was visiting a cousin in a Texas federal jail, court records show. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Until now, the focus of much of the investigators&rsquo; scrutiny has been McGriff&rsquo;s symbiotic relationship with Murder Inc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Court papers allege that the label used McGriff&rsquo;s &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; to intimidate competitors, while providing him with cover to launder his drug money and use credit cards and two-way pagers to facilitate his multistate operations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The court papers claim that McGriff&rsquo;s unrestricted access to Murder Inc.&rsquo;s office came complete with a set of keys to locked cabinets and drawers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McGriff served 10 years in federal prison for running one of New York&rsquo;s most violent and lucrative drug rings in the 1980s. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He is now serving a 37-month federal prison stretch after pleading guilty last June to possessing a weapon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another probe is looking into what possible role the coke kingpin might have had in the 2001 Maryland executions, which took place outside a drug-stash house. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Investigators suspect that McGriff orchestrated &mdash; or carried out &mdash; the twin killings because he feared one or both of the victims were contemplating cooperating with the government. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McGriff&rsquo;s fingerprints were found in the stash house, along with out-takes from a $1 million video co-produced by Murder Inc. and McGriff called &ldquo;Crime Partners.&rdquo; The footage captured McGriff stuffing large-denomination bills down his pants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to being eyed in the slayings, McGriff is under scrutiny for allegedly using his role as producer of the &ldquo;Crime Partners&rdquo; video to collect an under-the-table payout from Murder Inc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the overall probe also involves federal agents tracing a weapon once found on McGriff to Chris Gotti, after McGriff was stopped in July 2001 in a BMW in Harlem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The .40-caliber handgun was in McGriff&rsquo;s waistband, along with about $10,000 in cash and a New Jersey driver&rsquo;s license bearing his photograph and the name Lee Tuten. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McGriff told the cops his name was Rick Coleman and that he was an executive of a record company, Island Def Jam, the parent of Murder Inc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal agents traced the weapon to Las Vegas, where it had been purchased by Chris Gotti. Investigators believe the gun was given to Irv Gotti, who passed it to McGriff. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Adding to both Irv Gotti&rsquo;s and McGriff&rsquo;s troubles are Moore&rsquo;s comments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last year, Moore found himself in the midst of a two-hour standoff in Brooklyn with NYPD negotiators after being mistakenly suspected of shooting an NYPD captain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While talking to the FBI afterward, Moore said, &ldquo;People just give me money when I show up&rdquo; &mdash; referring to his alleged job as an enforcer &mdash; according to a federal source. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Moore later denied making the incriminating statement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Irv Gotti has denied any wrongdoing, claiming his relationship with McGriff is only one of a friend helping another friend and that McGriff never helped found Murder Inc. &mdash; which recently changed its name simply to Inc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gotti&rsquo;s lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, declined to comment on &ldquo;the continual flow of leaks,&rdquo; referring to the allegations. Gerald Shargel, who represents Chris Gotti, also declined comment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				McGriff&rsquo;s lawyer, Robert Simels, said his client has been the victim of wild innuendo. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;[McGriff&rsquo;s] name seem to come up with every unsolved crime,&rdquo; Simels said, insisting if the government &ldquo;had the goods&rdquo; they would have brought more charges against him. He now faces one firearms charge.
