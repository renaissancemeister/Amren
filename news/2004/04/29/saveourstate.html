			<h1>
				Immigrant Measure Won&rsquo;t Make Ballot
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				An attempt to deny benefits didn&rsquo;t get enough signatures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Aurelio Rojas, sacbee.com (Sacramento CA), Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The author of Proposition 187 conceded Monday his campaign will not have enough signatures to qualify another ballot measure designed to deny public benefits to illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to be on the ballot in November,&rdquo; said Ron Prince, who plans to make an official announcement today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Orange County accountant blamed the leadership of the Republican Party and vowed to mount a fund-raising drive to qualify the proposed constitutional amendment for the March 2006 ballot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The Republican Party establishment does not support this issue, (but) Republican voters certainly do and would like to have this on the ballot,&rdquo; Prince said in a telephone interview. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike 1994, when the GOP supported Proposition 187 &mdash; which was gutted by the courts after voters overwhelmingly approved it &mdash; the party steered clear of the new version. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Duf Sundheim, chairman of the state Republican Party, recently said the GOP was focusing on other issues, including re-electing President Bush and gaining seats in the state Legislature. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But political observers noted that after Proposition 187 passed, the GOP lost Latino votes and seats in the Legislature. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Democratic state Sen. Gil Cedillo, who is trying to persuade Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign legislation that would allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses, welcomed the latest news. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prince had predicted that if the measure qualified for the November ballot, Schwarzenegger would not sign Cedillo&rsquo;s bill &mdash; SB 1160 &mdash; and voters would decide the issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prince&rsquo;s measure would have prohibited illegal immigrants from obtaining driver&rsquo;s licenses and other public benefits, such as subsidized housing, food stamps and health care. 
			</p>
			<p>
				State and local agencies also would be barred from accepting consular-issued cards as proof of identity. But unlike Proposition 187, the measure would not have barred illegal immigrants from public schools &mdash; a power the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled states do not have. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cedillo lauded the GOP for declining to support Prince&rsquo;s campaign, which like Proposition 187 was grandly titled the &ldquo;Save Our State&rdquo; initiative. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The (Republican) leadership has taken the position that says, &lsquo;Look, we don&rsquo;t want to fight this on the margins and the extremes. &hellip; Let&rsquo;s be a little more thoughtful,&rsquo; &ldquo; Cedillo said, 
			</p>
			<p>
				Supporters of the proposed initiative needed to turn in 598,000 valid signatures to election officials by this week to qualify for the November ballot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prince had set a goal of collecting 800,000 signatures to ensure enough valid signatures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, he estimated the campaign had collected 483,000 &mdash; despite becoming a staple of radio talk shows and using the Internet to circulate petitions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We learned that even with the new technology, you still need professional signature-gatherers,&rdquo; said Prince, who raised less than $50,000 &mdash; not nearly enough to hire workers to circulate petitions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1994, Prince raised more than $400,000 with the backing of conservative politicians and organizations to qualify Proposition 187. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He estimated 30,000 people volunteered this time to circulate petitions, most of which were downloaded from the campaign&rsquo;s Web site, <a href="https://www.save187.com/">www.SAVE187.com</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The campaign, he said, also e-mailed 1.3 million petitions to interested organizations and sent out another 100,000 petitions by conventional mail. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prince expressed disappointment that not enough petitions were returned to the campaign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Timing worked against the campaign, said Prince, who hurriedly organized it after former Gov. Gray Davis signed Cedillo&rsquo;s SB 60 last September. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That measure would have allowed illegal immigrants to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses. But Schwarzenegger, who accused Davis of pandering to voters, persuaded the Legislature to repeal the driver&rsquo;s license measure after Davis was recalled in the October election. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to go through the incremental steps (including raising money) that you normally would go through if the circumstances were under your control,&rdquo; Prince said of the planned 2006 ballot measure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s negotiations with Cedillo on a new driver&rsquo;s license bill, which the senator says would require applicants to undergo background checks and obtain insurance, has angered many conservatives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Prince said only three Republican legislators &mdash; Sens. Tom McClintock and Roy Haynes and Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy &mdash; expressed support for his proposed ballot measure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prince said other GOP lawmakers were frightened of bucking the party&rsquo;s leadership. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The GOP, he maintains, dismissed an issue that would have energized voters and increased Bush&rsquo;s chances of carrying the state. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If this initiative were on the ballot, Republican turnout would be much higher than it otherwise will be,&rdquo; Prince said.
