			<h1>
				<a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,1-1090412,00.html">Blair Vows to Tighten Immigration System</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Philip Webster, Times Online (UK), Apr. 28</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A REVIEW of immigration was promised &ldquo;top-to-bottom&rdquo; by Tony Blair yesterday as he battled to restore his authority after the most difficult few weeks of his premiership. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prime Minister admitted that there was rising public concern caused by &ldquo;real and not imagined abuses of the system that lead to a sense of genuine unfairness&rdquo;. He spoke of abuse in particular countries or in particular schemes &ldquo;which the public quite rightly expects us to deal with&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His speech at the London Business School was a month after the resignation of his immigration minister Beverley Hughes for unintentionally misleading the public about East European entry scams. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her forced departure was a serious blow to Mr Blair and has been followed by an equally damaging dispute over his decision to call a referendum on the European constitution. That continued yesterday as prominent Blairites called on him not to give any more ground to the Eurosceptics. It was the most explicit recognition by any Labour leader in recent years of public worries on one of the most sensitive issues facing governments. He said Britain was at a &ldquo;crunch point&rdquo; on the issue and said concerns were not just &ldquo;figments of racist imagination&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also gave his strongest support so far for introducing compulsory identity cards as &ldquo;perhaps the most significant new measure on the horizon&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He confirmed new rules to stop people from anywhere in the enlarged EU coming to Britain just to claim benefits or housing, and the same would apply to migrants from elsewhere in the world. &ldquo;Whether they come to work in our hospitals or in our banks, they must be self-sufficient.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also promised: 
			</p>
			<p>
				A tightening of migration channels to ensure that overseas students come to Britain to study only if they choose institutions on an accredited list. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colleges may be required to notify the Home Office if any students fail to attend the course they came to study. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Third country nationals will have to apply to designated registry offices before they can marry in Britain and registrars may be given greater powers to refuse to marry those they believe falsely use marriages to abuse the system. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Consideration of measures to stop abuse of temporary employment routes and improving the enforcement and removal of illegal entrants and the rules in relation to appeals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We will neither be fortress Britain, nor will we be an open house,&rdquo; Mr Blair said. &ldquo;Where necessary, we will tighten the immigration system. Where there are abuses, we will deal with them, so that public support for the controlled migration that benefits Britain is maintained.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The &ldquo;vast bulk&rdquo; of British people were not racist &mdash; but expected the Government to respond to their worries, the Prime Minister said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That is why we have begun a top-to-bottom analysis of the immigration system.&rdquo; 
			</p>
