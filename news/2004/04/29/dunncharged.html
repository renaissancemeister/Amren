				<a href="https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?storyID=4944949">Calif. Professor Charged with Hate Crime Hoax</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Reuters, Apr. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LOS ANGELES (Reuters) &mdash; A Southern California college professor who received wide media attention when she claimed that racists had vandalized and defaced her car with ethnic slurs was charged on Monday with filing a false police report and insurance fraud. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kerri Dunn, a professor of psychology at Claremont McKenna College, east of Los Angeles, portrayed herself as a victim of racists angered by her message of tolerance at a campus forum when she reported the vandalism on March 9. She then put in a claim with her auto insurer for damages to her car. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her story drew media attention and prompted hundreds of students to rally in her name, joined by civil rights activists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But police and FBI agents who investigated the incident began suspecting Dunn of a hoax after witnesses came forward to say they had spotted the 39-year-old professor vandalizing her own car. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She was charged with one misdemeanor count of filing a false police report and two felony counts of insurance fraud. She faces three years in prison if convicted at trial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;False accusations that imply hate crimes prey on the legitimate concerns of the public who truly abhor violence based on race, ethnicity or sexual orientation,&rdquo; Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said in a statement. &ldquo;And those who make false claims should realize there is a penalty for doing so.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				After Dunn&rsquo;s car was found covered in racial slurs, its tires slashed and windshield shattered, college officials offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Claremont President Pamela Gann has said the college would conduct its own investigation before deciding whether to retain Dunn, whose contract expires later this year.
