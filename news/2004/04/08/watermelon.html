				Wigging Out, Racist Molecules, Language Lessons 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Scott Norvell, FoxNews.com, Apr. 5</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				State officials in Tennessee pulled a public health ad from the radio waves there after listeners complained that it played to racial stereotypes by mentioning the word watermelon, reports the Nashville Tennessean. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ad, placed on 10 stations statewide by the <b>Tennessee Department of Health</b> (<a href="http://clickit.go2net.com/search?cid=307797&amp;site=srch&amp;area=is.clicktracking&amp;shape=link&amp;cp=info.foxnws&amp;clickurl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.foxnews.com%2Finfo.foxnws%2Fredirs_all.htm%3Fpgtarg%3Dwbsdogpile&amp;ext_qcat=web&amp;ext_qkw=Tennessee%20Department%20of%20Health">search</a>), encouraged listeners to &ldquo;try baking your chicken, eating a fresh tossed salad on the side and scrumptious watermelon for dessert.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was intended to have any racial overtones,&rdquo; said Diane Denton, spokeswoman for the department. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want to offend anyone. We want to be culturally sensitive.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But even some African-Americans contacted by the paper thought the reaction was overkill. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wonderful advertisement. Tell them to put it back,&rdquo; said the Rev. Enoch Fuzz, who heads the health committee of the local <b>NAACP</b> (<a href="http://clickit.go2net.com/search?cid=307797&amp;site=srch&amp;area=is.clicktracking&amp;shape=link&amp;cp=info.foxnws&amp;clickurl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.foxnews.com%2Finfo.foxnws%2Fredirs_all.htm%3Fpgtarg%3Dwbsdogpile&amp;ext_qcat=web&amp;ext_qkw=NAACP">search</a>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;African-Americans are dying at a much higher rate than other populations, and we&rsquo;ve got to turn that around. That&rsquo;s a stereotype we&rsquo;ve got to get past. We can&rsquo;t get sensitive.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Do as We Say, Not as We Do</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The president of the <b>University of Central Florida</b> (<a href="http://clickit.go2net.com/search?cid=307797&amp;site=srch&amp;area=is.clicktracking&amp;shape=link&amp;cp=info.foxnws&amp;clickurl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.foxnews.com%2Finfo.foxnws%2Fredirs_all.htm%3Fpgtarg%3Dwbsdogpile&amp;ext_qcat=web&amp;ext_qkw=University%20of%20Central%20Florida">search</a>) was forced to apologize after a picture of him and a university trustee wearing Afro wigs appeared on the front page of the campus newspaper, reports the Orlando Sentinel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				UCF President John Hitt said he was merely mimicking the many UCF basketball fans who have taken to wearing wigs in support of Dexter Lyons, a black student who wears his hair in a combed-out Afro. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lyons himself said he was honored that the president wore the wig, but critics on campus accused Hitt of perpetuating racist stereotypes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Truth Hurts (cont.)</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				European Union officials who rejected a study that blamed rising anti-Semitism on the continent on Muslims have issued a new version of the report, this one blaming neo-Nazis and white kids for the problem, reports the <a href="/news/main-jhtml_xml_/news/2004/04/01/wsemit01.xml">Daily Telegraph</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While admitting that some violence was committed by young Muslims of North African or Asian extraction, a summary of the new report by the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia says &ldquo;The largest group of the perpetrators of anti-Semitic activities appears to be young, disaffected white Europeans.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The summary contradicts the main body of the report, which claims, for example, that nine percent of the anti-Semitic attacks in France last year were by traditional, neo-Nazi-like groups. The figures were similar in Belgium. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Victor Weitzel, who wrote a large section of the new study, told The Telegraph that the latest findings had been consistently massaged by the EU watchdog to play down the role of North African youth. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The European Union seems incapable of facing up to the truth on this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything is being tilted to ensure nice soft conclusions &hellip; When I told them that we need to monitor the inflammatory language being used by the Arab press in Europe, this was changed to the &lsquo;minority press.&rsquo;&ldquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Molecular Mayhem</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A teacher at a high school in Seattle has been suspended and faces disciplinary action for stating sarcastically in class that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like black people,&rdquo; reports the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/jamieson/167063_robert31.html">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The science teacher at Cleveland High School was reportedly fielding students&rsquo; questions about why he is so hard on them when he used what the school calls &ldquo;racially inappropriate language.&rdquo; His tone was described as that one would use when mocking a ridiculous assertion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Columnist Robert Jamieson, however, says the teacher erred grievously because he comes from &ldquo;a position of white-male privilege&rdquo; and his audience was &ldquo;primarily poor teens of color and the space all around them swarms with volatile molecules of race.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Offensive Mannequin</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Council on American-Islamic Relations is hot and bothered about a mannequin in a used car dealer in Rochester, Minn., that it describes as &ldquo;clearly offensive and insulting,&rdquo; reports the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4692802.html">Minneapolis Star-Tribune</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The mannequin, which has stood unnoticed in the corner of the office for two years, is dressed in what is described as vaguely Arabic &ldquo;ethnic garb.&rdquo; A belt made of rope and wire holds three empty toilet-paper rolls, made to look like explosives, and the character is holding a gas-tank hose. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;These actions do nothing to promote anything positive between cultures and community,&rdquo; said Rabiah Ahmed, communications coordinator for CAIR. A Winona State student from the Sudan, Wail Kailani, brought the statue to CAIR&rsquo;s attention. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Language Lessons</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A city official in Jacksonville, Fla., is being called a racist for using the phrase &ldquo;you people&rdquo; in response to a contractor&rsquo;s troublesome questions, reports WJXT. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Contractor Bernard Wilson&rsquo;s questions about a blueprint were met with a reply from city engineer Bobby Henderson that &ldquo;you people are asking too many stupid questions&rdquo; and that he didn&rsquo;t have time to waste &ldquo;on your uninformed questions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wilson is demanding an investigation and has hired a lawyer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;You people&rsquo; has a history of being a discriminatory remark, and that is how Mr. Wilson took it,&rdquo; said the lawyer, Robin Roberts.
