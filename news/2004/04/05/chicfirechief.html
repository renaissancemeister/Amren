			<h1>
				Daley Chooses Trotter to Deflect Political Heat 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>John Kass, Chic. Tribune, Apr. 2</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				With racial controversies smearing his Fire Department, Mayor Richard Daley sent his fire commissioner, a white man, into retirement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fire Commissioner James Joyce said he was excited to retire. They&rsquo;re always excited on the way out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Daley replaced him Thursday with Cortez Trotter, a black man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Trotter spent his career on the paramedic side of the department, not the firefighting side. So history is being made on two fronts, not just the obvious one. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yes, Trotter is the first black man to run an overwhelmingly white department, where some firefighters won&rsquo;t like him because his skin is darker than theirs. They might be some of the same idiots who&rsquo;ve gone on fire radios recently, anonymously yelling racial slurs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But what about the other historical front? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Oddly, the new fire commissioner might not be held responsible for fighting fires and probably won&rsquo;t ever take command of a major fire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a paramedic and bureaucrat, he has never spent much time directing firefighters in front of burning buildings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet the mayor insisted that his decision had nothing to do with politics or symbolism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;No, no no,&rdquo; Daley said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a symbol. He&rsquo;s qualified. He&rsquo;s very proud. He&rsquo;s African-American. . . . But he&rsquo;s qualified.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				To prove that racial politics have nothing to do with his promotion, Trotter served notice that diversity is the most important issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In order for every community to feel confident in the Fire Department and EMS [ambulance] service they receive, our department must reconcile our operational issues,&rdquo; Trotter said sternly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But more importantly, we must address our human relations and diversity problems.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also warned white firefighters who might have a problem with a black boss. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate any shenanigans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Let me serve notice to those who wrongfully believe that the department is a haven for small-mindedness, offensive behavior and stagnation,&rdquo; Trotter said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We are entering a new era for the Chicago Fire Department. Please recognize that for what it is, or be prepared to face the consequences of your actions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				For too long, the Chicago Fire Department has been a club for white guys, with the top jobs handed from grandfather to father to son. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That doesn&rsquo;t work anymore in a city that is mostly black and Latino. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It especially doesn&rsquo;t work when the city is run by a white mayor-for-life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But make no mistake, this appointment is about covering Daley&rsquo;s flank, not the Fire Department&rsquo;s flank. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though Daley controls minority politicians, he&rsquo;s got a problem coming. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This summer, Daley&rsquo;s friends, the Outfit-connected Duffs, will go on trial in federal court. A grand jury has charged that they fraudulently received $100 million in affirmative action contracts, though they were white guys. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In effect, they stole $100 million from black, Latino and female-owned firms. And I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can believe that $100 million in deals leaves City Hall without Daley&rsquo;s OK. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So having Trotter and other minorities out front in high profile positions, getting TV time, can&rsquo;t hurt the mayor. It can only help. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Trotter, executive director of the Office of Emergency Management and Communications, faces other political challenges too. The vast majority of 911 calls don&rsquo;t involve fires; they involve ambulance requests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This move reflects the changes in the department,&rdquo; said a paramedic commander who happens to be white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is not about black and white, it&rsquo;s about paramedics and firefighters, and it&rsquo;s about time that our side of the department got some clout,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Trotter will give us that.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The fire commissioner&rsquo;s job is political and administrative, yes. But it is also about fighting fires and saving lives, not only of fire victims, but also the lives of firefighters under his command. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Daley has made the political decision that extensive fire command experience isn&rsquo;t necessary for the top fire job. If you&rsquo;ve got questions on that front, take it up with him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The tragic and needless deaths at the 69 W. Washington St. fire may be attributed to a lack of command experience by some fire bosses at the scene. If Trotter had been commissioner then and it was found he had little if any fire command experience, he&rsquo;d be the one forced to resign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a paramedic, Trotter will have to earn the respect of firefighters. As a black man, he has decided to push affirmative-action policies while dealing with a union opposed to racial preferences. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Trotter will need all his political skills to succeed. He&rsquo;s been given a terribly tough job. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s all about fire, the political kind.
