			<h1>
				Fight over Reparations Turns into Brawl at City Council 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Doug Miller, 11 News (TX), Mar. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A noisy argument erupted Tuesday afternoon at Houston&rsquo;s City Hall over slavery reparations. And it ended up with Houston&rsquo;s mayor ordering police to remove black activist leaders from the city council chambers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Slavery reparations supporters want Mayor Bill White to put a resolution on the city council agenda. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It started out quietly enough with slavery reparations supporters demanding the mayor put a resolution on the city council agenda. But what activists call a fight for justice turned into a free-for-all as supporters of reparations for descendants of slaves forced a confrontation with the mayor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stand here until we get a date,&rdquo; said Kofi Taharka with the National Black United Front. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the mayor doesn&rsquo;t want to vote on slavery reparations. And a couple of the speakers refused to leave the podium unless the mayor set that date. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not gonna leave the podium until we get a date,&rdquo; said Taharka. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you want the police to escort you out we&rsquo;ll be happy to do that,&rdquo; said Mayor White. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If that means I got to jail today, then I&rsquo;m down with that,&rdquo; said Taharka. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to touch any of these other brothers and sisters, don&rsquo;t touch any of these other brothers and sisters. But I&rsquo;m not leaving this podium until we get a date or you take me out of here to jail.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The speakers wouldn&rsquo;t budge. So the mayor finally told police to take the speakers who refused to leave the podium out of the council chamber. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall for this man,&rdquo; activist Quanell X said to the officers. &ldquo;Let them bring the white boys in here.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Council members hastily adjourned to a back room as police led a couple of the slavery reparations supporters out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It ended up with a noisy shoving match, a confrontation between police and black activists with police trying to remove them from the lobby outside. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Somehow, somebody ended up on the ground complaining the cops had knocked him down and hurt his spine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And after all the sound and fury the wheels of government quietly rolled on. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The mayor describes the idea of slavery reparations as a distraction and says he believes the citizens of Houston would prefer their council to talk about the nuts and bolts issues like traffic, transportation and fixing the streets. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the bottom line is the resolution supporting a national commission to study slavery reparations is not on the council agenda. And right now it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t look like it will be anytime soon.
