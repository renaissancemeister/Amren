			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>IndustryWatch, Mail on Sunday (UK), Mar. 21 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				FOR more than 100 years it stood proudly as the centrepiece of England&rsquo;s oldest public park before being decapitated during a Second World War air raid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now a row has broken out after plans to replace Derby&rsquo;s historic Florentine Boar statue were abandoned for fear of offending Muslims, whose religion considers pigs to be &lsquo;unclean&rsquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A replica of the statue, a crouching wild boar, was intended as the jewel in the crown of a Pounds 5 million National Lottery-funded restoration of the city&rsquo;s Arboretum Park. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But councillors have called for the proposal to be scrapped amid sinister warnings that the statue would be vandalised or stolen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Florentine Boar statue stood from 1840 until 1942 when it was beheaded by a German bomb. But it was last week branded &lsquo;offensive&rsquo; during a meeting of Derby Council&rsquo;s minority ethnic communities advisory committee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Councillor Suman Gupta, a Labour representative for Derby&rsquo;s Derwent ward, told the meeting: &lsquo;If the statue is put back in the Arboretum, I have been told it will not be there the next day, or at least it won&rsquo;t be in the same condition. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;We should not have the boar because it is offensive to some of the groups in the area.&rsquo; The park is in an area known for its large Pakistani community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Shokat Lal, a community leader, said at the meeting: &lsquo;In Normanton the majority of residents are Pakistani Muslims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;I&rsquo;m not saying we have to lose the boar, but we could put the boar in the city centre so it does not cause offence to people.&rsquo; Local historian Christopher Harris told The Mail on Sunday: &lsquo;We are living in a multicultural society and I hope that would include English culture. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;If the boar had never been destroyed in 1941, these people would have grown up with it and would not have noticed it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;Activists have jumped on the chance to make a statement. It is one that damns English culture-But the wild boar is part of Derby&rsquo;s culture.&rsquo; He said a small minority of Muslims with extreme political views had issued veiled threats to the council over the statue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The land for the park was donated to the council in September 1840 by Joseph Strutt, the first mayor of the Borough of Derby, a wealthy cotton mill owner who wanted to give the public a place to exercise. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He commissioned architect J.C. Loudon to landscape the area. The hollow ceramic boar was donated by Mr Strutt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sculpted on commission by W. J. Coffee &mdash; and based on drawings of a similar statue in the Market Nuovo in Florence &mdash; it was intended as a gift to the working classes of Derby. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last week&rsquo;s committee meeting proposed that a statue of Mr Loudon should be erected at the Arboretum with a new site for the boar in the city centre. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last night, Councillor Gupta told The Mail on Sunday: &lsquo; Communities change.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tory leader Philip Hickson said: &lsquo;The community is strong enough to stand a statue of a boar in a park. But we live in an age where sometimes things are a little more politically correct than they ought to be.&rsquo;
