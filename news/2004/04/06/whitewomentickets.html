				White Women More Likely Ticketed when Pulled Over 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Ian Demsky, Tennesseean.com, Mar. 4 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ticket in hand, Richard Taylor stood outside Nashville traffic court and spoke his mind about who he thinks gets a ticket and who gets off with a warning when stopped by police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most likely to get a ticket? 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Young black men,&rdquo; said Taylor, 39, an African-American. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And most likely to get a warning? 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Old white people,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But a Tennessean analysis of Metro police traffic stop data from 2003 shows that perception is not true. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the data, white women were most likely to get ticketed when pulled over by police &mdash; 93.3% of the time. By comparison, black men were ticketed 88.2% of the time they were stopped. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The newspaper&rsquo;s analysis compared only the percentage of stops in which motorists were ticketed &mdash; not the overall numbers of tickets given to different demographic groups. Of 126,000 stops last year, motorists were ticketed 91% of the time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ticketing rates do not vary greatly for different racial and gender groups &mdash; they were within 6 percentage points of each other. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Those numbers seem to indicate balanced enforcement,&rdquo; said Jack McDevitt, associate dean of College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Massachusetts. &rdquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all looking for.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				McDevitt also said the rate of citations was fairly high compared to other parts of the country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Metro Police Chief Ronal Serpas, who has stepped up traffic enforcement since taking over the department in January, said he doesn&rsquo;t expect the percentage of stops that lead to tickets to grow significantly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My message to my officers is that I don&rsquo;t expect them to issue a citation to everyone they stop,&rdquo; he said. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s built on discretion.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Deciding when to issue a ticket and when to give a warning is left to individual officers and is not regulated by police policy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The officers are using their experience and knowledge. I can&rsquo;t second-guess every decision they make,&rdquo; Serpas said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Giving a warning can also help remind people to pay more attention to their driving, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re out to do is change behavior,&rdquo; Serpas said. &rdquo;The No. 1 predictor for collisions is failing to pay attention.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				So far this year, injury crashes in Nashville are down about 8%, Serpas said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Statistics that only describe who gets a ticket don&rsquo;t tell the whole story, experts say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				David Harris, a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law and author of Profiles in Injustice: Why Racial Profiling Cannot Work, said there are subtle ways police bias can affect who gets stopped for a ticket. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Harris said bias can sometimes be found in the types of people officers stop for having a cracked tail light, a headlight out, tinted windows or items hanging from the rearview mirror. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Police might also have a tendency to stop some motorists to a greater or lesser degree than they are represented in the population of drivers. For example, the Tennessean analysis showed far more men pulled over than women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Taylor, the motorist outside traffic court in Nashville, said he&rsquo;s received about half a dozen tickets over the years and has never been let off with a warning. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They got me for speeding,&rdquo; he said with a smile Wednesday afternoon. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s OK. I was speeding.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kim Newson, 38, an African-American, who was with Taylor on Wednesday, said she had &rdquo;never, never, never&rdquo; been given a warning either, &rdquo;just tickets.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to police figures, Newson is less likely than a white woman her age to get a ticket if stopped &mdash; but she said she doesn&rsquo;t believe it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Serpas said the police department faces a challenge changing public perceptions because people are much more likely to discuss bad experiences with police than good ones. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Most importantly, we need to remind ourselves that 97% of cops are getting it right,&rdquo; he said. &rdquo;Some are getting it wrong. We need to correct their behavior so those 3% don&rsquo;t hold the other 97% hostage.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another common perception is that women, especially young and pretty ones, are more likely to be given warnings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2003, women got tickets in 92.3% of stops, compared to 90.3% for men &mdash; although almost twice as many men were stopped, the data showed. Motorists age 16-25 got tickets in 91.85% of stops, compared to 88.7% for those 61-70. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Women in almost every age and racial category were more likely to get tickets than their male counterparts. But Hispanic women ages 16-25 and 36-45 were less likely than Hispanic men to be ticketed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a group, white women were more likely to get a ticket than anybody else. 
			</p>
			<p>
				White women between 16 and 25 were the second-most-likely demographic to get a ticket. Asian women between 36 and 45 were more likely to get ticket when stopped. But they were stopped fewer times &mdash; 54 for the year, compared to 8,359 for white women 16 to 25. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Veteran Metro traffic officer Foster Hite said he hardly ever gives breaks to anyone stopped for a moving violation, such as speeding or running a stop sign. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The warnings he gives are usually to people who have a broken headlamp or tail light. They most likely make up many of those 9% of people who, on average, don&rsquo;t receive a citation, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And Hite said he always checks to see whether they&rsquo;ve been stopped for the same thing previously. If they have, there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll get a ticket. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I try to treat everybody the same,&rdquo; said Hite, who has at times written more than 300 tickets a month. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If anything, Hite is more likely to write a ticket to young violators in an attempt to curb their errant behavior early. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If I write them a ticket and they attended a safe driving video, it may benefit them more than letting them go,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Occasionally Hite will give a break to an interstate speeder who fails to drop from 70 mph to 55 mph on the highways approaching Nashville. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Attitude does have a lot to with it,&rdquo; he said. &rdquo;But we&rsquo;re just trying to slow people down and save lives.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hilario Navarro, 24, a Hispanic man, was on his way to see his father who was leaving for Mexico the next day when he was stopped for going 41 mph in a 30 mph zone. He also spoke to The Tennessean outside traffic court. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Navarro said he was kind and respectful as he explained to the officer that he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention and didn&rsquo;t notice the speed limit had changed. It didn&rsquo;t help. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The way I talked to him, I think he would have given a ticket to anybody,&rdquo; Navarro said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Getting busted 
			</p>
			<p>
				We asked visitors to Tennessean.com who they thought was the most likely to get off without a traffic ticket during a stop by police. Most who responded indicated that women and white and older drivers would be more likely to get off. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Metro police figures show that people&rsquo;s perceptions don&rsquo;t match reality. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Who do you think is more likely to get off without a traffic ticket? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Women, 86.8%; men, 13.2% 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whites, 73.2%; minorities, 26.8% 
			</p>
			<p>
				Old, 88%; young, 12% 
			</p>
