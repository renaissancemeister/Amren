				$100 million tale earns only $9.2 million in opening weekend 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>WorldNetDaily.com, Apr. 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rallying cry of &ldquo;Remember the Alamo&rdquo; is suddenly &ldquo;Forget &lsquo;The Alamo&rsquo;&ldquo; &mdash; at least when it comes to the new Disney film which took in a meager <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=alamo.htm">$9.2 million in its opening weekend</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked, quite honestly, at the number,&rdquo; Chuck Viane, Disney&rsquo;s head of distribution, told USA Today. &ldquo;If I could only figure out what went wrong, you&rsquo;d never let it happen again. The movie deserved better than it did.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The $100 million epic, which recounts the last stand of American heroes including Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, finished in third place behind a resurrected &ldquo;Passion of the Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hellboy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The poor box-office showing of &ldquo;The Alamo&rdquo; comes on the heels of a WorldNetDaily report last week focusing on allegations the film is filled with revisionist history and political correctness. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The movie reads more like a Disney fairy tale and promotes a politically correct revisionist agenda aimed at destroying a traditional American hero,&rdquo; said B. Forrest Clayton, a visiting fellow with <a href="https://www.freedomalliance.org/">Freedom Alliance</a>, a pro-military nonprofit organization. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Clayton says he obtained a screenplay of the film in advance and found it to be &ldquo;full of inaccuracies.&rdquo; He says Davy Crockett is portrayed as a &ldquo;frightened wanderer&rdquo; who wanted to escape &ldquo;over the wall&rdquo; in the dark of night during the historic battle, but felt paralyzed and trapped by his own undeserved heroic reputation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The fact that the film tanked upon debut &ldquo;is noteworthy and ill-timed because Disney and its chief executive officer, Michael Eisner, are under heavy pressure to meet or exceed the company&rsquo;s financial targets in the wake of a shareholder revolt,&rdquo; according to Dow Jones Newswires. &ldquo;At Disney&rsquo;s recent annual meeting, 43% of the shares voted opposed Mr. Eisner&rsquo;s re-election to the board. The board stripped Mr. Eisner of his chairman title as a result, and his ability to hang on as chief executive is now tied closely to Disney&rsquo;s performance in coming months.&rdquo;
