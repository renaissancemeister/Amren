				<a href="http://www.washingtondispatch.com/article_8616.shtml">When Representatives of Congress Don&rsquo;t Represent Americans</a> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Frosty Wooldridge, Washington Dispatch, Apr. 1</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last week, Project USA, an immigration reduction group paid for billboards in Utah that asked the House of Representatives Chris Cannon R-Utah, a huge question all over Salt Lake City. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Congressman Chris Cannon wants amnesty for illegal aliens. Do you?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Latest Zoby and Roper Polls show that 80% of Americans want illegal immigration stopped. What is it that the Congress can&rsquo;t see or read in those figures? 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s important to understand that Chris Cannon in the House and his counterpart Orin Hatch in the Senate have done nothing to stop illegal immigration before 9/11 or since. In their native Utah, over 65,000 illegal aliens have disrupted school systems, bankrupted medical services and put a lot of Utahans out of work or depressed their wages. Utah suffers the most underfunded education system in the country. It&rsquo;s paving 16,000 acres of farmland annually. It does not have enough water. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a wild reply, Cannon called the billboard creators every name in the book. They were &ldquo;racists and anti life.&rdquo; He must not have read the sign, which clearly stated the word, &lsquo;ILLEGAL&rsquo;. He was so distraught he asked people to call his personal cell phone at: 801 362 8300. Since this writer lives in Colorado where we have over 150,000 illegal aliens costing us thousands of lost jobs for Coloradans as well as over $140 million annually for educating illegal alien children K-12, I gave Cannon a call. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To his credit, he listened when I asked how come we have 13 million illegal aliens in this country? What about &lsquo;carrying capacity&rsquo; being overwhelmed by importing the Third World into our country and creating an added 200 million people? What about species extinction? What about standard of living and quality of life being denigrated as hordes of illegals crossed over our borders? What about the 16,000 cases of MDR tuberculosis and 7,000 new cases of leprosy brought into the USA in the past four years by illegals that avoided health screenings at our borders? What about stolen jobs and lost wages? What about the lack of water when Colorado adds five million and California adds 20 million via immigration? Mr. Cannon, what about the rule-of-law illegals break? 
			</p>
			<p>
				This writer was not prepared for the astounding if not amazing lack of comprehension of Cannon&rsquo;s answers. I can say unequivocally that Representative Chris Cannon of Utah lacks the basic common sense and mental acuity of a bucket of water. He said that America could add millions of people, which will create even more wealth. He felt the Mexican illegal immigrants were providing greater opportunities for all Americans. He noted they had added $30 billion to US coffers from their work last year. I responded they cost US taxpayers $90 billion in our taxes to pay for their use of our schools, ESL and medical services. I noted that 1/3 to 1/2 of them work under the table. He didn&rsquo;t hear me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He went on to say that Africa was underpopulated. They needed more population. He further said that, &ldquo;Look at France. They are underpopulated. They are being taken over by Muslims because France has a stable population, but immigration will make them a Muslim state in 50 years.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				I asked him what the French thought of their country speaking Arabic and becoming a Muslim state? Did that mean France would no longer be French? That France would be the new Iraq? He didn&rsquo;t have an answer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He felt that God would take care of America no matter what our population. I asked him what was the point of adding a billion or two billion people to America? Hadn&rsquo;t the 129 million people in Bangladesh with a landmass the size of Utah proven that overpopulation makes everyone miserable? Was God taking care of Bangladesh where over 50% of the children die before age five? That question zoomed right over his head. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As I listened to this man for 15 minutes, I got the distinct realization that Chris Cannon was out of touch with what is happening to Americans. He either does not understand this crisis or he is blind to its implications. He and Senator Orin Hatch are doing everything they can do to encourage illegal aliens to come into this country and remain here. In other words, both elected officials are working for people from foreign countries. They are not representing American citizens much less Utahans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They are not carrying out their sworn duty to uphold the US Constitution. They are breaking INS Law: &ldquo;A person (including a group of persons, business, organization, or local government) commits a federal felony when she or he assists an illegal alien she/he should reasonably know is illegally in the U.S. or who lacks employment authorization, by transporting, sheltering, or assisting him or her to obtain employment, or encourages that illegal alien to remain in the U.S. by referring him or her to an employer or by acting as employer or agent for an employer in any way, or knowingly assists illegal aliens due to personal convictions. Section 8 USC 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv)(b)(iii).&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet Hatch and Cannon both support the Dream Act that gives illegal aliens instate tuition to taxpayer funded schools. They support illegal aliens obtaining driver&rsquo;s licenses. Does anyone remember the 9/11 terrorists who enjoyed driver&rsquo;s licenses? Cannon and Hatch support K-12 education for illegal alien kids. Further, they have done nothing to stop illegal immigration at the borders nor have they supported the Border Patrol. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cannon and Hatch support people from other countries breaking into our country against our laws. Yet, they swore on the Bible to &ldquo;Uphold the Constitution of the United States.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				After hanging up the phone, I had talked to a US Congressman who was serving Mexico more than America. When I think of the 3,000 people who died at the WTC on 9/11, I now realize why it happened. When I see the outsourcing, offshoring, wage depression, language chaos in our schools, accelerating drugs coming across our borders and the outright fraud enveloping our country, it all comes clear. One look at California shows you the bow of the United States of Titanic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Is it any wonder that Hormel in Austin, MN has hired thousands of illegal aliens? What about Tyson Chicken in Iowa? How about paving firms, construction and fast foods that hire millions of illegals? What about Wal-Mart? How about the Dream Act pushed by Hatch, Udall and Degette of Colorado and Cannon of Utah? What about Mexican ID cards? Whose country is this anyway? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our own elected representatives in the Congress are more interested in power and money for corporations &mdash; than American citizens. They are more interested in turning America into another Third World nation. In the meantime, you and I must contend with our country not being represented by our elected officials. I suggest Chris Cannon resign his office and run for the cabinet of Vicente Fox. Cannon can learn Spanish and have his kids running around neighborhoods with ample drugs, loud music and five cars parked in every yard. He can enjoy cockfights and horse tripping on Sundays, instead of the NFL. If his kids catch tuberculosis, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll get plenty of medical aid from Mexico&rsquo;s excellent hospitals. His kids will receive outstanding education from Mexico&rsquo;s excellent schools. Yes, since you aren&rsquo;t representing Americans Mr. Chris Cannon, I invite you to move to Mexico where you&rsquo;ll be of more help to President Fox. Maybe they will raise a new billboard, &ldquo;THANK YOU GRINGO CHRIS CANNON FOR MAKING MEXICO ALL IT CAN BE BY SENDING OUR POOR, UNEDUCATED MASSES TO AMERICA SO THEY CAN STEAL AMERICAN JOBS AND SEND BACK $15 BILLION ANNUALLY TO FILL MEXICAN COFFERS.&rdquo;
