			<h1>
				Welcome Back, Khadr!
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Paul Fromm, C-Far Newsletter</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dear Immigration Reformer: 
			</p>
			<p>
				Truly, this is Absurdistan. Veteran Toronto Sun columnist Robert MacDonald provides a good overview of the outrageous al Qaeda family, the Khadrs. Yes, they belong to us. This Egyptian family, because of our idiotic immigration and refugee system, are actually Canadian citizens. The sons and father have been al Qaeda guerrillas. The 14 year old son Abdul Karim Khadr was wounded in a firefight with Pakistani security forces. He&rsquo;s now back here with his mother to get patched up. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ma Khadr, Maha Elsamnah told the Globe and Mail (April 10, 2004): &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice,&rdquo; to be back in Canada. Of course it is. Our tax slave saps will pay to patch up and medicate her junior warrior. Our handouts and medicare are fine. For the rest, well, quite frankly, she hates us. &ldquo;Last month, in a TV interview from Pakistan, she praised her late husband as a martyr for Islam and said he chose the right path for her four sons. Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and its training camps instilled proper values, she said. She insisted that the time the Khadrs spent in the compound with Mr. bin Laden was better than a life in Canada, where her boys could have become homosexuals or drug addicts.&rdquo; (Globe and Mail, April 10, 2004) 
			</p>
			<p>
				Isn&rsquo;t it time we considered stripping these vipers of their Canadian citizenship. Yes, it&rsquo;s a serious step. However, for reasons of ethnic vengeance and politics, our federal government is spending millions trying to denaturalize frail, aged Germans and Slavs for not having answered questions about their connection with the losing side in WW II &mdash; questions they may not have actually been asked and the transcripts of which interviews have long since been destroyed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Khadr family hate us and our way of life &mdash; well, all except for the medicare and handouts. It may well be they lied in their applications for status in Canada. If so, they should be stripped of their citizenship and sent back to some Islamic despotism more in keeping with their beliefs. 
			</p>

				Directo CANADA FIRST IMMIGRATION REFORM COMMITTEE 
			</p>
			<p>
				From the Toronto Sun, April 11 2004 
			</p>
			<p>
				FAMILY AND friends of the 24 Canadians killed in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 must be shocked to learn that members of an &ldquo;al-Qaida family&rdquo; have been allowed back into Canada. I&rsquo;m referring to the arrival Friday at Pearson airport of Maha Elsamnah and her 14-year-old son, Abdul Karim Khadr. They are the wife and son of Egyptian-born Ahmed Said Khadr, a top official in Osama bin laden&rsquo;s al-Qaida terrorist network. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only did the family &mdash; including three other brothers &mdash; live near the terrorist training camps of bin Laden in Afghanistan, but they were involved in fighting against anti-terrorist forces that included Canadians. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The father, Ahmed, was killed recently in Pakistan in fighting with security forces. Karim ended up shot and paralyzed in the same firefight. 
			</p>
			<p>
				GUANTANAMO BAY 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another son, Omar, 17, is being held by U.S. forces at Guantanamo Bay. He&rsquo;s charged with killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan during a battle against al-Qaida and supporting Taliban forces. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another brother is still on the loose, believed to be an al-Qaida-Taliban commander in the Afghanistan &mdash; Pakistan region. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And a fourth brother, Abdurahman Khadr, was released from a U.S. jail and allowed to return to Toronto. When he was interviewed by CBC-TV last month, he commented: &ldquo;We are an al-Qaida family.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				His mother and a sister, interviewed in Pakistan, said they were proud of their family&rsquo;s connection to al-Qaida. The mother said she&rsquo;d be happy if her children died the same way as her husband &mdash; an al-Qaida Muslim &ldquo;martyr&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What&rsquo;s really shocking about this family&rsquo;s return is that the federal Liberal government &mdash; both under Jean Chretien and now Paul Martin &mdash; has been so helpful to them over the years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Back in 1995, Ahmed Khadr was arrested in Pakistan for his role in a deadly embassy bombing. Later, on a visit to Pakistan, Prime Minister Chretien appealed to the Pakistan president to have him released. It was done. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Apparently, a so-called aid program headed by Ahmed Khadr received help from a Canadian federal government agency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And what did Khadr do? Why, he ended up heading back to bin Laden &mdash; along with the whole Khadr family. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And now, these years later, the Paul Martin-led Liberal regime has gone out of its way to help these recent Khadr family members return to Canada. Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham&rsquo;s office interceded and gave special visas to the mother and son to return to Canada. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No wonder Conservative foreign affairs critic Stockwell Day declared: &ldquo;The whole thing is outrageous &mdash; that she (Mrs. Khadr) would be afforded the full rights of Canadian citizenship when she and her family &hellip; have been involved in the training fields and the killing fields of al-Qaida.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Which brings us to that terrible day of Sept. 11, 2001 when a group of Arab-Muslim terrorists connected to al-Qaida hijacked civilian airliners and slaughtered more than 3,000 men, women, and children, including two dozen who were Canadians. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They included the likes of Ken Basnicki, a 48-year-old father of two killed in the north tower of the World Trade Center. The last word from him was a cell phone call to his mother at 8:55 a.m. from the burning tower. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And there was David Barkway, a 34-year-old executive from Toronto who was visiting a client on the 105th floor of the north tower. Before dying, he sent an electronic message to colleagues in Toronto, saying he was in trouble. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;A BIG HEART&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				There was Christine Egan, of Winnipeg, visiting her brother in the south tower. &ldquo;She had such a big heart,&rdquo; recalled friend Sharon Judd. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The truth is that the paralyzed Abdul Karim Khadr needs special medical care. And just as soon as he meets the residency requirements &mdash; some say three months &mdash; he&rsquo;ll be eligible for OHIP support paid for by Ontario and Canadian taxpayers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And some of those taxpayers will be the still-grieving families and friends of those ruthlessly murdered 24 Canadians. That is really outrageous. Thanks goes to Martin and his always vote-seeking Liberals. (Toronto Sun, April 11 2004)
