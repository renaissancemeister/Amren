			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Edward Hegstrom, Houston Chronicle, Apr. 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most days, teams of Latino immigrant workers swarm over the townhouses under construction near Gulfgate, filling the air with the buzz of power tools and orders shouted in Spanish. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the site was nearly silent Thursday. Instead of dozens of workers, there was just a handful, mostly Anglo contractors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Like dozens of work sites across greater Houston, construction at the Gulfgate site was nearly brought to a standstill because the immigrant workers had fled, likely after hearing rumors of government immigration raids. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The crews have just scattered, sometimes leaving their tools at the site,&rdquo; said Allen Griffiths, a plumbing contractor who busied himself talking on a two-way radio Thursday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just brought construction to a halt.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rumors &mdash; which the government denies &mdash; have spread throughout greater Houston, affecting work from Pasadena to Tomball. Other businesses &mdash; like groceries, meat markets, lawn services and taquerias &mdash; have also lost workers and customers because of the rumors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rumors have been spreading for about a week, workers said. But they gained momentum Wednesday afternoon, when Houston Spanish-language radio stations and then television began reporting the news. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides recounting rumors of buses and helicopters used to raid work sites, some immigrants say they have heard of agents setting up roadblocks on Houston-area freeways. Those interviewed do not know where the rumors began. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this got started, but it just spread like wildfire,&rdquo; said Luisa Aquino-Deason, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, formerly the INS. &ldquo;Our detention and removal officers have not been out rounding people up&rdquo; from work sites, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigration officers always work at capturing fugitives, Aquino-Deason said, but they typically visit specific homes in search of criminal immigrants instead of raiding work sites. Immigration agents may visit a work site in search of an illegal immigrant who is also a criminal fugitive, she said, but they would not arrest others there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some immigrant-rights activists said they have become so mistrustful of the federal government that they don&rsquo;t believe the official denial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A lot of times, the (government&rsquo;s) public relations is very different from the reality,&rdquo; said Adriana Cadena, an activist with the Service Employees International Union, which is working to organize immigrants. &ldquo;The question is: Why aren&rsquo;t they acknowledging this?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cadena and other activists had a news conference Thursday morning to denounce the alleged raids. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A visit to some of the sites supposedly raided Thursday turned up no evidence. At a work site along Spring Cypress Road near Tomball Parkway, a worker with a cellular phone said he had just talked with someone who saw a raid taking place at a site a few miles away, at FM 2920 and Kuykendahl. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At that location, workers said they had seen a helicopter hovering low. But the site is near Hooks Airport, where civilian helicopters were seen flying Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, those who showed up for work on the homes there said they had little to do Thursday. Guadalupe Rivas, a bricklayer, sat idly. The six men who normally work with Rivas didn&rsquo;t show Thursday, and he could not work without the crew. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same all over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The carpenters, the concrete layers, the Sheetrock workers &mdash; everyone left.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				There also were rumors of a raid at a meat market on the east side of town. The manager denied that he had been raided but said the persistent rumors have hurt his business. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one butcher working,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;Normally, I have six or seven.&rdquo; The others did not show up because they fear being deported, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The manager did not want his name used because he was essentially acknowledging that some employees may be in the country illegally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, there was less work to be done at the meat market. The lunchtime business was down because workers did not show up at nearby construction sites, he said. And the owners of taquerias have been buying less meat because they, too, are doing less business, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The government has not mounted general workplace immigration raids for years in the Houston area, Aquino-Deason said. Raids occurred at two local Wal-Mart stores last year and at Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2002. But both of those operations were tied to specific national investigations, and they resulted in the deportation of fewer than 100 people locally. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, both the airport operation and the Wal-Mart raids caused widespread fear among illegal immigrants throughout the area, said Nelson Reyes, head of the local office of the Central American Refugee Center, or CARECEN. Though there have not been many workplace raids in recent years, immigrants constantly worry that the trend could be reversed, Reyes said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of the estimated 8 million illegal immigrants in the country have lived here for years, and some have children who are U.S. citizens. Even without legal documents, some workers have been able to settle down, buying furniture on credit or even homes, Reyes noted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the more illegal immigrants settle in, the more they have to lose, which causes a constant edginess, Reyes said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is a terror of being separated from your loved ones,&rdquo; Reyes said. &ldquo;There is a fear that an (immigration) official in a green uniform could come and take away your future.&rdquo;
