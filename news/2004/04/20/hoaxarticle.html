			<p class="subhead">
				Campuses often provide conditions that can cultivate false reports of racist or anti-gay acts, experts say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Nora Zamichow and Stuart Silverstein, L. A. Times, Apr. 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Colleges across the nation have become the stage for hate crime hoaxes that thrust the purported victim into the limelight and twist campuses into turmoil. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At San Francisco State, two black students reported racial epithets scrawled in their dorms. At Northwestern University, a freshman told police that someone grabbed him from behind, held a knife to his neck and uttered an anti-Latino slur. At the College of New Jersey, the treasurer of a gay organization said someone sent threats on his life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In each instance, police said, the alleged victims turned out to be the perpetrators. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although such incidents occur everywhere, experts say college campuses can provide the perfect petri dish for cultivating a hoax: a community capable of rallying to correct a perceived injustice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A person who is a victim of a hate crime can probably expect to get almost universal sympathy on a college campus. Out in the world at large, that&rsquo;s not necessarily true,&rdquo; said Mark Potok, who has researched hate crime for the Southern Poverty Law Center. &ldquo;But on a college campus, you are very likely to get the support of the administration, the faculty and virtually all the students. It tends to put you in the limelight very quickly.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month, classes halted at the Claremont Colleges as students and faculty rallied in support of Kerri Dunn, a visiting professor of psychology whose car was vandalized and spray-painted with anti-Semitic slurs after a forum denouncing intolerance. A hate crime, Claremont police first said. But a week later, police alleged Dunn did it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dunn has denied any wrongdoing. The FBI and the Los Angeles County district attorney&rsquo;s office are investigating. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Campus hoaxers are usually students, experts said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;A professor is part of the power structure,&rdquo; said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. &ldquo;A professor also has much more to lose.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Motivation varies. Some believe their cause is so worthy that any means of getting attention is justified. For others, it&rsquo;s revenge. Still others are mentally ill, experts say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In several cases, the perpetrator was attempting to divert attention from a personal problem or cover a mistake. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes hoaxes are staged for what seem like relatively trivial reasons. A San Francisco State student, Allison Jackson, now 21, reported to police in September that someone wrote &ldquo;black bitches&rdquo; on a dorm room door. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Later in the month, after being confronted with a handwriting analysis, Jackson said she faked the incident, according to a campus police report, because she wanted &ldquo;a roommate change&rdquo; and housing officials were taking too long to respond. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I was given the advice that in order for the roommate move to be taken seriously, things needed to occur,&rdquo; Jackson said, according to the report. She wrote on the door, she told police, &ldquo;because that was the drastic event that was going to get us moved.&rdquo;
