			<h1>
				City Secretary Guilty of 4.5m Pound Fraud
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Vik Iyer and Ju-lin Tan, PA News, Independent.co.uk, Apr. 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Top City PA Joyti De-Laurey was today found guilty of fleecing her bosses of nearly 4.5 million pounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The jury at Southwark Crown Court in London convicted De-Laurey of four counts of using a false instrument and 16 counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception. The total of value of her fraud was 4,303,259 pounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The panel had been considering its verdicts since last Wednesday afternoon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				De-Laurey, 35, of London Road, North Cheam, Surrey, denied the charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The prosecution alleged that she forged her bosses&rsquo; signatures on cheques and cash transfer authorities to raid their savings secretly and embark on a string of spending sprees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				De-Laurey&rsquo;s husband Anthony, a 50-year-old former chauffeur, was convicted by the same jury of four counts of money laundering but cleared of four other related charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The defendant&rsquo;s mother, Dr Devi Schahhou, a 68-year-old GP of King Henry&rsquo;s Road, Hampstead, north west London. was convicted of four counts of money laundering and cleared of one count. 
			</p>
			<p>
				De-Laurey, who was convicted by a majority of 11-1 on each count, was guilty of fraud on a &ldquo;massive scale&rdquo; and went on what the prosecution described as &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo; spending sprees. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She led a life of luxury after stealing from a succession of leading bankers, betraying their trust over the years and indulging in a prolonged shopping spree that included Cartier jewellery, expensive cars and a 750,000 pound Mediterranean villa as well as other properties. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She even wrote &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; letters to God, apparently asking for divine intervention to help her escape detection by multi-millionaire financier Edward Scott Mead and other victims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In one heaven-bound plea, the jury was told the mother of one begged for &ldquo;protection&rdquo; and for her relationship with her employers &mdash; blue chip investment bank Goldman Sachs &mdash; to survive &ldquo;untarnished&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Please look after me and keep my family safe and happy and without money worries,&rdquo; she was said to have written. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In another &ldquo;Dear God&rdquo; missive discovered in her office following her arrest, she prayed: &ldquo;I need one more helping of what&rsquo;s mine upon my return and then I must cut down and cease in time all the plundering.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She went on: &ldquo;Please ensure my job is safe and my integrity is unquestioned on my return &hellip; and that these remain secure throughout.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sentencing was due later today. 
			</p>

				Trusted Secretary Did Not Know When To Stop Stealing
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Melvyn Howe, PA News, Independent.co.uk, Apr. 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				To her bosses, Joyti De-Laurey was the perfect secretary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Self-assured, poised, extremely efficient and apparently totally trustworthy, they regarded her as the best PA money could buy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But beneath the polish of her private education and ready smile lurked a woman riven by jealousy, consumed by greed and burdened by debt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The multi-millionaires she worked for at Goldman Sachs inhabited a world she felt should be hers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She lusted after their luxury villas, servants and party-planner social life, their top-of-the-range cars, first class flights and five-star holidays. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of them &mdash; Ron Beller &mdash; blew more than 86,000 pounds on &ldquo;personal travel&rdquo; in 2000 alone. The same year wine soaked up a further 17,800 pounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her insatiable greed began soon after she joined the blue chip investment bank in May 1998 as a recruitment agency temp. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But her husband Anthony, a 22,000-pound-a-year chauffeur for Lloyds Register, could never hope to bankroll her desires. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A former Royal Naval rating, who then specialised in torpedo and anti-submarine sonar, he later joined the Ministry of Defence police guarding such places as Aldermaston and Porton Down. Sometimes he was armed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spell as a chauffeur for the Bahrain royal family followed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time the couple met in a BMW car showroom where she worked, he had a similar driving job with Lloyds Register. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They married in 1995 &hellip; several times. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ever one for the grand statement, she decided that as his third wife it was only fitting they have three weddings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The first was at a register office, the second was a traditional Hindu affair &ldquo;for mummy&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;, while the third took place at the Chapel of Love during their Las Vegas honeymoon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 25-minute ceremony &mdash; at which the cab driver who drove them there doubled as a witness &mdash; was conducted by a black Elvis Presley &ldquo;lookalike&rdquo; complete with quiff, cowboy boots and all-white outfit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They were in love and, in due course, were blessed with a son. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as the union would never provide her with the serious wealth De-Laurey hungered after, she &ldquo;coldly calculated&rdquo; a solution &mdash; rampant dishonesty. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Becoming a permanent staff member in August 1999 and PA to her first victim, Jennifer Moses, not long afterwards, provided the means. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Behind a smokescreen of imaginary cancer and a large helping of sympathy, she embarked on a &ldquo;massive&rdquo; betrayal of trust that shocked the City and made uneasy reading for bosses the world over. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And if her seven-figure dishonesty brought a guilty twinge or two, a few thousand to the occasional charity and some treats for the &ldquo;gals&rdquo; in the office did wonders for smoothing out any inconvenient kinks in her conscience. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With each cheque and money transfer request she forged, she came ever nearer to the &ldquo;lavish lifestyle&rdquo; she craved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By August 2001 she had managed to milk more than 1.1 million pounds from Jennifer Moses and her husband Ron Beller, both managing directors at the bank. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although at one point he thought his investment account might be &ldquo;one or two million light&rdquo;, he could find nothing wrong and decided he was mistaken. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If De-Laurey had decided to call it a day at that stage, she might have got away with it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But like many fraudsters before her, she did not know when to stop. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She wanted much more, and after they left the company, still unaware what she had done, she targeted their even wealthier successor Edward Scott Mead. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He, too, trusted her implicitly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She had already siphoned off 113,970 pounds from one of his investment accounts when the banker decided to add a multi-million pound apartment in New York to his growing collection of homes on either side of the Atlantic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The PA immediately realised it would provide the perfect cover for her single largest theft. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her regular contact with the &ldquo;private wealth management team&rdquo; that looked after the huge investments belonging to Goldman&rsquo;s top executives, and the trust she enjoyed, could not have made her dishonesty easier. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After casually informing one of the team&rsquo;s client analysts that the apartment&rsquo;s vendor lived in Cyprus, she forged Mr Mead&rsquo;s signature on an authentic-looking transfer request, and asked for that apparent purchase cash to be sent there &mdash; all 2.25 pounds million of it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Theresa Voight, who processed the transfer on January 26 2002, never once suspected the J Schahhou account it went to was one De-Laurey had set up in her maiden name. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She waited just over three weeks before she decided she had got away with it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Between February 20 and April 26 &mdash; six days before her arrest &mdash; she pocketed a further &pound;1.1 million. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By that time her boss was nearly 3.4 pounds million the poorer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A combination of her unstoppable greed and his generosity sealed her fate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On May Day he asked the wealth management team to make a sizeable donation to Harvard, his former college. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He was shocked to learn he did not have enough, and was further stunned when he was told of unauthorised transfers to Cyprus. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By that time De-Laurey had already handed in her notice and told him she was moving to the island as the Archbishop of Nicosia&rsquo;s new assistant. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Mead suspected her immediately and the following day she was arrested. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if she had managed to flee to the 750,000 pound seafront villa bought with the banker&rsquo;s cash, her choice of destination contained a fatal flaw. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of those who helped bring her to justice believes she may have chosen the Mediterranean idyll after hearing it lacked an extradition treaty with Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But unlike alleged swindler Asil Nadir of Polly Peck fame, it seems she failed to appreciate that only applied to the Turkish-controlled northern sector. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Greek-governed south she had her heart set on would have happily heeded a British extradition request for her return.
