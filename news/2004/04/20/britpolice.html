				<a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1193861,00.html">Met Plan to Fast Track Black Recruits</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Vikram Dodd, Guardian (UK), Apr. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Britain&rsquo;s biggest police force is urging positive discrimination in favour of black recruits in one of the most radical reforms in nearly 30 years of race relations law, the Guardian has learned. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Metropolitan police wants to &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; ethnic minority people into its training schools ahead of some white candidates to make its force more representative of London&rsquo;s racial mix. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Met believes its plan for positive discrimination would be illegal under the 1976 Race Relations Act as it stands. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The force says if the proposal is blocked, the government target to have 25% of its officers from the ethnic minorities by 2009 will be missed by &ldquo;light years&rdquo; despite having had a decade to succeed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Met is more white than the population it serves, and the target was set after the force was branded institutionally racist by the Macpherson report into the Stephen Lawrence scandal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Within the next fortnight Met chiefs will meet the Commission for Racial Equality to ask for its advice and backing. If secured, it will seek the support of the home secretary, David Blunkett. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Martin Tiplady, the Met&rsquo;s head of human resources, told the Guardian: &ldquo;We need to change the Race Relations Act so that we are allowed to positively discriminate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This plan is the one that needs the most work, it is the most radical and would have the best chance of success.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Guardian understands that CRE chiefs believe they should have the power to exempt an institution from the act if that would make it more representative. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics of the Met have accused it of doing too little to crackdown on racism in the ranks, which deters ethnic minority people from joining. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Met insists that the plan would not cause a drop in the quality of recruits and promises that no suitable white applicant would be turned away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Successful recruitment campaigns mean there are now more suitable applicants than there are training places. This has resulted in a wait of up to a year for a place. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Met wants the right to select ethnic minority candidates to start training right away while some white applicants would wait. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Although a quarter of Londoners are from ethnic minorities, the proportion within the Met is only 6.5%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since 1998 the force has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers, but Mr Tiplady said: &ldquo;If we carry on with 1% growth a year it will be light years before we have a workforce that is representative of the people we serve. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If we have an ethnic minority candidate and an indigenous candidate, then we can only select on merit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We want to explore, if we can recruit not just on merit, but also on ethnicity.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The law allows positive action, such as encouraging applications from disadvantaged groups, but positive discrimination is unlawful. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Glen Smyth, chairman of the Met&rsquo;s Police Federation, said he understood the scheme&rsquo;s aims, but had reservations: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t solve one problem by creating another. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What we mustn&rsquo;t do is create an artificial situation that creates further difficulties and resentments. If some people have had an unfair advantage we&rsquo;re actually placing a burden on them.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Leroy Logan, chairman of the Met&rsquo;s Black Police Association, denied the plan would be unfair: &ldquo;There is an obvious imbalance in the force and it needs to be corrected so we can do our job properly.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But he said with ethnic minority officers four times more likely to leave the force in their first two years than white ones, more would needed to be done: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about numbers. We need to sustain and retain people who are in the force already. We&rsquo;re haemorrhaging black staff.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lawyer Makbool Javaid, a discrimination specialist and the CRE&rsquo;s former principal legal officer, said an institution could offer extra help to underrepresented groups, but once they compete for jobs merit is the only lawful criterion: &ldquo;The CRE cannot grant an exemption. Since completing the training course leads to a job it would need a change in the law.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The CRE is already investigating all 43 forces in England and Wales after the BBC&rsquo;s Secret Policeman programme revealed shocking levels of racism among recruits. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An earlier plan to boost recruitment by offering a &pound;350 &ldquo;bounty&rdquo; for black recruits was dropped after critics said it had overtones of slavery. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Guardian has learned that a plan for an all black intake for a year at Hendon has also been shelved.
