				Late-night &lsquo;Uncut&rsquo; offers uncensored, explicit versions of clips 
			</p>

			<p>
				NEW YORK &mdash; Given all the barely clad women that are booty-shaking, grinding and gyrating on BET during the day, it&rsquo;s hard to believe things could get any wilder after dark. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as the rap group Whodini once rhymed, &ldquo;the freaks come out at night.&rdquo; And on BET &mdash; already criticized for showing videos with a high T&A quotient &mdash; the videos become even more graphic during the wee morning hours on &ldquo;BET Uncut.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While outright nudity is blurred out, the clips still contain enough sexual content to make R. Kelly blush. There&rsquo;s Ludacris&rsquo; &ldquo;Booty Poppin&rdquo;&rsquo; video, featuring close-ups of jiggling posteriors as women take it all off in a strip club. And in Nelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tip Drill&rdquo; video, women shake so wildly that bikini bottoms pop off, and a posse of leering men grab various body parts. Later, the women simulate sex acts with themselves. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s doing them. I think it&rsquo;s a helluva promotional tool,&rdquo; said Luther &ldquo;Luke&rdquo; Campbell of 2 Live Crew fame, widely considered the godfather of scandalous music videos. &ldquo;It gives an artist a chance to express themselves a little bit more.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the hip-hop world, sex has long been part of that expression. Campbell&rsquo;s early '90s videos had bikinied women doing the butt-jiggle when &ldquo;dirty dancing&rdquo; was considered shocking. Tupac Shakur&rsquo;s &ldquo;How Do You Want It&rdquo; video in 1996 featured real porn stars (although they didn&rsquo;t have sex on camera). And these days, everyone from Snoop Dogg to Lil&rsquo; Jon to G-Unit&rsquo;s Lloyd Banks are promoting videos that are actually X-rated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Before, artists were mostly making sexually oriented material for the underground market &mdash; providing them to strip clubs, or selling them as part of videos or DVDs. Now, they&rsquo;re bringing them directly to television, through places like &ldquo;BET Uncut&rdquo; and the Playboy network. And more outlets are growing for those who want to see more &mdash; or less &mdash; than a bikini. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like the other videos are like foreplay and the uncut videos are the act themselves,&rdquo; says video director Nzingha Stewart, a woman who has directed clips for artists ranging from ODB to Common to Joss Stone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Another outlet for artists</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We all want to see videos uncut,&rdquo; says music producer Jermaine Dupri, who makes a cameo appearance in Nelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tip Drill.&rdquo; &ldquo;We hate making clean versions &mdash; I do. So &lsquo;Uncut,&rsquo; they don&rsquo;t let us play the lyrics, but they let us do videos however we want to do it, so, it&rsquo;s another outlet for us.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Explicit videos aren&rsquo;t exclusive to rap. There were topless women on Motley Crue&rsquo;s 1987 video &ldquo;Girls, Girls, Girls,&rdquo; which was recently featured on an uncensored rock videos DVD from Interscope. Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Erotica&rdquo; video from 1992 featured the singer completely naked, obscured only by strategically placed black bars. (MTV played it, but only in the early morning hours.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the videos on &ldquo;BET&rsquo;s Uncut&rdquo; make Madonna seem as tame as Clay Aiken. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They typically feature full-figured black women dirty dancing at a frenetic pace. Close-ups are reserved not for faces, but for voluptuous posteriors. In Nelly&rsquo;s video, he swipes a credit card between a women&rsquo;s buttocks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even Big Boi of OutKast &mdash; an avid strip-clubber who had a stripper pole built into his house &mdash; has been taken aback by some of the content. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Some of it is getting really distasteful &mdash; it&rsquo;s like giving it a bad taste, it&rsquo;s really exploiting women,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What they&rsquo;re doing now it&rsquo;s kind of like soft porn. I saw some (stuff) the other day. &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t even know they could do that on TV.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The show started in September 2000, and airs Wednesday through Friday at 3 a.m. ET. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Stephen Hill, a senior vice president for BET, said &ldquo;Uncut&rdquo; is for adult eyes only &mdash; a disclaimer runs before the naughty videos air. &ldquo;Any kid up at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, their biggest problem is not BET,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Nothing new to TV</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hill insists that &ldquo;nothing that we run on &lsquo;Uncut&rsquo; is not seen in prime-time television.&rdquo; There is plenty of blurred nudity on regular television today, from CBS&rsquo; &ldquo;Survivor&rdquo; to MTV, which has even shown naked couples licking whipped cream off each other. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Typically, though, such content is not presented in such a raw fashion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;BET just gets more of a rap for it because critics focus more of their attention on BET,&rdquo; Hill says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Stewart complains that uncensored videos promote negative stereotypes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there should necessarily be censorship of the images of women, but it&rsquo;s an extremely one-sided look at women. There&rsquo;s no other images to counteract it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the last video I saw where a black woman had a job, and that&rsquo;s really more our experience than black women being strippers.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				More is on the way &mdash; the Playboy network started their &ldquo;Buckwild&rdquo; show this year. Hosted by Ken &ldquo;Buckwild&rdquo; Francis, it plays uncensored videos with full nudity in between saucy segments with various hip-hop artists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a demand to get anything without censorship,&rdquo; says Francis, who also produces his own line of &ldquo;Buckwild&rdquo; videos, sort of like a black &ldquo;Girls Gone Wild.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you put a blur there, you create a demand, because people are nosy by nature.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And the Playboy network plans to start a block of hip-hop programming called &ldquo;H.Y.P.E&rdquo; later this year, as a precursor for a network of the same name (Universal Music Group was reported to be starting its own uncensored music video network, but a spokeswoman called that premature). 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re 21 years old, you&rsquo;re ready to see the videos the way they were meant to be,&rdquo; says Tracy Lawrence, President of H.Y.P.E. TV. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to have them edited like they are for outlets where they have teens watching.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Mirroring the lyrics</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lloyd Banks of G-Unit, fronted by 50 Cent, says uncensored videos allow the artists to make videos that mirror the content of their lyrics, which typically carry a parental advisory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If we were to shoot the &lsquo;Groupie Love&rsquo; video, there would have to be an &lsquo;Uncut&rsquo; video. If you&rsquo;re not thinking of sexual acts, there&rsquo;s something wrong with you,&rdquo; says Banks, who&rsquo;s coming out with an &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; porn DVD later this year that allows the viewer to choose what sex acts women do. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Artists have made videos for sexually explicit songs for years. Why are the videos finally catching up? 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People want more. The sex is definitely in the music, and sex is in all aspects in the music,&rdquo; says Campbell. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He credits underground videos like his &ldquo;Luke&rsquo;s Freak Fest,&rdquo; a popular video series featuring nude women, and Snoop Dogg&rsquo;s foray into hosting porn videos with injecting soft porn into videos. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether we&rsquo;ll ever see Britney Spears &ldquo;Uncut&rdquo; is doubtful. But BET&rsquo;s channel already has fans among the mainstream set. 
			</p>
			<p>
				R&B hitmaker Usher, who counts himself as a viewer, says he might even consider doing one &mdash; but only if its &ldquo;tastefully done.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, he admits it&rsquo;s a guilty pleasure: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind of in the wrong for even watching it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s crazy about it, after it&rsquo;s off, the inspiration of the day comes on,&rdquo; he says, referring to the BET&rsquo;s block of religious programming, which starts at 4 a.m. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve got to get &lsquo;prayed up&rsquo; after watching it,&rdquo; he laughed.
