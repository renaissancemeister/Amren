			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Civil-rights action includes assault charge for confrontation 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>WorldNetDaily.com, Mar. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A California appeals court has allowed a black leader to pursue six claims against Jesse Jackson, including assault, battery and civil rights violations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The claims against Jackson, his son Jonathan, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and Judge Gregory Mathis was brought by Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, who held his fifth annual &ldquo;National Day of Repudiation of Jesse Jackson&rdquo; event in Los Angeles on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Peterson&rsquo;s rally, held outside Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow/ PUSH office, aimed to &ldquo;show the contrast between Dr. King&rsquo;s dream and Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s nightmare.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawsuit alleges the defendants, during a Dec. 10, 2001, public meeting to discuss the awarding of minority-oriented contracts by Toyota, surrounded and assaulted Peterson, calling him a &ldquo;nigger.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that the courts have ruled in our favor,&rdquo; said Peterson, founder and president of <a href="http://www.bondinfo.org/">the Brotherhood Organization of A New Destiny</a>, or BOND. &ldquo;Jesse Jackson now knows that he has to answer for his crimes. I&rsquo;m looking forward to facing him in court.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The public-interest law firm <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/">Judicial Watch</a>, assisting Peterson, will now return to Los Angeles Superior Court to pursue the claims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said, &ldquo;The court ruled Jesse Jackson, Judge Mathis, and the rest of their gang can not hide behind the First Amendment when they assault someone.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The December 2001 incident arose when Peterson heard Jackson had encouraged Toyota to create a minority outreach plan, administered by one of Jackson&rsquo;s good friends. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the public meeting, Peterson tried to ask whether Toyota would discriminate against conservative black-run organizations such as BOND. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Soon after the question was posed, Jackson&rsquo;s son Jonathan shoved Peterson, blocked his exit, and along with Jesse Jackson, Judge Mathis, and other Rainbow/PUSH associates surrounded Peterson, screaming, threatening and taunting him. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Peterson said, trapped in the center of a violent mob, he feared for his life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jackson and the other defendants brought a special motion to strike the lawsuit, claiming it arises from the defendants&rsquo; right to free speech. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The trial court allowed the assault claim to proceed but dismissed the civil rights and certain other claims. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Judicial Watch appealed, arguing the actions of Jackson and his co-defendants had nothing to do with free-speech rights. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The appeals court essentially agreed and March 10 ruled in favor of Peterson, concluding six of the seven claims at issue could not be dismissed on account of Jackson&rsquo;s free-speech rights. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Peterson&rsquo;s recent book, <a href="http://www.shopnetdaily.com/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1319">&ldquo;Scam: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America,&rdquo;</a> he shows how the civil-rights establishment, led by Jackson, has made a lucrative career out of keeping racial strife alive in America. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Peterson reveals how establishment black leaders endlessly promise solutions to the problems of America&rsquo;s inner cities, but deliver only ineffective Band-Aids. From the dismal failure of the welfare system, to the farce of the slavery-reparations movement, to the problems within black churches and the hypocrisy and corruption of current black &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; Peterson argues the real crisis we face is spiritual, and that no economic solution will suffice.
