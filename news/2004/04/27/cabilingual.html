			<p class="subhead">
				O.C. Grand Jury criticizes continued focus on bilingual teaching. District officials deny they&rsquo;re ignoring state law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Joel Rubin, L. A. Times, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				After being battered for years over how it teaches its Spanish-speaking students, the Santa Ana Unified School District took another hit Monday when the Orange County Grand Jury sharply criticized it for continuing to overemphasize bilingual education. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The focus on teaching in Spanish, the grand jury&rsquo;s 20-page report said, is slowing students&rsquo; progress and contrary to the intent of a state law requiring students to be taught primarily in English. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Santa Ana Unified &ldquo;has fostered an atmosphere that has encouraged resistance to implementation of Proposition 227,&rdquo; the jury concluded, referring to the 1998 law that requires all California students to be taught in English unless their parents request a waiver. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though the district is only compelled to respond publicly to the report&rsquo;s findings, the jury&rsquo;s conclusions are certain to reopen the debate over bilingual education in Santa Ana. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you look at this report, you&rsquo;ll see an ideology,&rdquo; said Supt. Al Mijares, who criticized the jury&rsquo;s conclusions. They suggest, he said, that the district was showing &ldquo;insubordination to the law and a resistance to it. And that is absolutely not true.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The debate over bilingual education has been a contentious one in Santa Ana, where more than two-thirds of the 60,000 students are designated as &ldquo;English learners.&rdquo; The issue was at the center of the 2003 recall of district trustee Nativo V. Lopez, who was accused by many of encouraging schools to flout Proposition 227. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The jury&rsquo;s report concluded that, since the law&rsquo;s passage, Santa Ana has promoted multiyear, bilingual programs while not properly reevaluating students in the programs. It also faulted the district for exempting from the law far too many students who would otherwise attend classes taught in English.
