			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Channing Gray, Providence Journal, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Composer Richard Wagner went to great lengths to tell the tale of the Flying Dutchman, the cursed ship&rsquo;s captain condemned to sail the seas for all eternity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Playwright Leroi Jones, taking considerable liberties with the legend, has told the story in far less time, with far less punch. At least that&rsquo;s the case with the production of Dutchman that opened in previews last week at Providence Black Repertory Company. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The show, directed by Julia Murphy, boasts a catchy set and a fine performance from Lauren Lovett, who plays Lula, the subway-riding she-devil who ensnares a studious young black man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Lamar Gregory, as the nerdy black man, has trouble pulling off his big moment in the spotlight, as he finally explodes after being taunted by Lula. Gregory, a Johnson &amp; Wales marketing major, is a newcomer to the stage with a lot of natural ability. He&rsquo;s fine as the shy, retiring Clay. But when he becomes enraged &mdash; the high point of the play &mdash; his actions seem forced and his words are hard to make out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Distant kin to the myth 
			</p>
			<p>
				But then, Jones&rsquo; script is often hard to decipher. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones, who in the late 1960s changed his name to Amiri Baraka to reflect his Muslem beliefs, has based his play very loosely on the myth that Wagner turned into an epic opera. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the opera, the Dutchman, already damned for cursing the heavens during a storm, comes ashore to find the love that will set him free. In Jones&rsquo; pithy one-act play, the Dutchman takes the form of a white temptress who rides the subways, preying on blacks. Those who mess with her are doomed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dutchman dates from the early '60s, and is layered with bare-knuckle language and references to black repression and white domination. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Clay tries to fit in, wears a suit and tie, and politely tolerates the seductive Lula&rsquo;s advances and her increasingly demeaning insults. Lula toys with Clay, gets him aroused, then questions his manhood and calls him the &ldquo;n&rdquo; word. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pushed to the breaking point, Clay finally finds his voice and turns on Lula, only to meet his undoing. In other words, blacks in Jones&rsquo; America just don&rsquo;t count, and when they do stand up for themselves, they get shot down. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Short trip by train 
			</p>
			<p>
				For this production, Black Rep has turned its downstairs performance space into a rumbling subway car, complete with sound effects. The cast sits on sterile metal benches, as rectangles of light flash on the wall behind them, creating the illusion of a train lurching through a darkened tunnel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A nice thing about the show is the closeness of the quarters. Sit in the front rows, and you feel like you&rsquo;re sharing the train car with the characters. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A drawback is this is one very short play, only about 45 minutes in length, if that. Black Rep should have definitely found a companion piece to fill out the evening. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While the play focuses on the cat-and-mouse game between Lula and Clay, zombie-like creatures wearing masks come and go on the train. Presumably, these are the ghostly crew members of legend, although in Jones&rsquo; retelling their role is a little less clear. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s this mixing of myth with a hard-hitting clash between the races that takes some of the kick out of the play, that makes it seem like a bad Twilight Zone episode. Had Jones just stuck with the encounter between Clay and Lula, Dutchman might have been stronger. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Temptress with teeth 
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, Lauren Lovett, a strong presence with considerable New York theater experience, is worth catching. She turned in a wonderfully mercurial performance Saturday night, at one moment flirting, the next slashing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There were funny little details to her portrayal, like checking the bottom of her shoes while waiting to board the subway. But it was the overall shape of the role that was most impressive, as she transformed herself from loopy seductress to something truly ugly and dangerous. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dutchman runs through May 30 at Providence Black Repertory Company, 276 Westminster St., Providence. Shows are Thursdays at 7 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets are $15. Call 351-0353.
