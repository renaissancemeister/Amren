			</h1>

				<i>Business Day, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				EXTREME poverty in sub-Saharan Africa defined as people living on less than $1 a day has almost doubled in 20 years, according to the latest World Development Report, published by the World Bank. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This was in contrast to the overall trend in developing countries, where poverty has declined, mainly due to faster economic growth in China and India. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the World Bank, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in developing countries dropped from 40% to 21% of global population between 1981 and 2001. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the bank&rsquo;s report highlighted &ldquo;worrisome trends&rdquo; in subSaharan Africa, where the number of people in extreme poverty climbed to 314-million in 2001 from 164-million in 1981. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Moreover, Africa represented the one region where the proportion of very poor people increased, rising to 46,5% in 2001 from 41,6% of the population in 1981,&rdquo; the bank said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The main reason for the rise in poverty was a 15% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the region over the 20 years. In contrast, GDP per capita in China rose by more than five times since 1981. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fran&ccedil;ois Bourguignon, the bank&rsquo;s chief economist, said China and India&rsquo;s growth performance helped deliver a &ldquo;dramatic reduction in the number of poor&rdquo;, which could result in the development goal of halving poverty worldwide by 2015 being met. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the goal which was agreed by 189 countries at the United Nations in 2000 may be beyond the reach of some poorer countries, the bank&rsquo;s report said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bank&rsquo;s president, James Wolfensohn, said at a press briefing that the objective of poverty eradication was being sidelined as the countries focus on issues of global terrorism. With Sapa-AFP
