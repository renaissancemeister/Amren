				<a href="https://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/topstory/2532937">Immigrant Roundup a Myth, Officials Say</a>
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				But few at meeting calmed by promises 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Edward Hegstrom, Houston Chronicle, Apr. 26 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The meeting was intended to calm fears and assure immigrants that federal officers were not conducting mass raids to round up undocumented workers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But most of the 400 indignant Latinos at the meeting Monday night simply did not believe it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The raids are happening,&rdquo; said Cristobal Hinojosa, a leader of Mexicans in Action, who drew cheers from the crowd gathered in the gym of the Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans on the Gulf Freeway. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The meeting was called in response to panic in the greater Houston immigrant community caused by rumors of raids in recent weeks. The rumors virtually shut down some construction worksites and also affected many businesses as illegal immigrants stayed in their apartments or in some cases fled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Top local officials from the federal immigration service assured the audience that they are not conducting raids, and representatives from the Houston City Council and Congress all backed up the claim. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have not been conducting mass raids of apartment complexes&rdquo; or of construction sites, churches or schools, said Joseph Webber, special agent in charge of the Houston office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the crowd wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. Norma Luz Hernandez told representatives her brother-in-law was picked up outside his job. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They hunted him like a rabbit,&rdquo; Hernandez said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An immigration official asked Hernandez if her brother-in-law might have been picked up because he has a criminal warrant, but she denied it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My brother-in-law is not a criminal,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the meeting was conducted in Spanish without translation. The English-language comments of Webber and U.S. Rep Gene Green were translated into Spanish. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While denying they are conducting raids, immigration officials acknowledge that they continue to do regular enforcement actions, typically involving searches for immigrants who are convicted criminals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rumors of raids began circulating among construction workers in late March, when a helicopter was spotted at a worksite along Texas 288 south of Houston. But the rumors became widespread panic around the second week of April, partly because they were picked up on Spanish-language radio, some experts say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly 200 students failed to show up one day last week at Manuel Crespo Elementary School near Gulfgate after rumors spread of a raid at the apartment complex across the street. Families scrambled to gather what they could and leave the complex. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In other instances, the rumors have caused many illegal immigrants to stay home, which has affected businesses that market to Latinos, according to Abel Sanchez, a representative of C&aacute;mara de Empresarios Latinos de Houston, a Latino business group. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have received a lot of complaints in the past few weeks,&rdquo; Sanchez said in Spanish. He said business owners were complaining that neither workers nor customers were showing up. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of those called to the meeting to calm fears let people in the audience know they understood how this has affected the community. Harris County Constable Victor Trevi&ntilde;o told the crowd about how his U.S.-born 10-year-old grandson had asked if he could get taken away because he is Hispanic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When the children are talking about this, that is not right,&rdquo; Trevi&ntilde;o said in Spanish, to cheers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Trevi&ntilde;o and a representative of the Houston Police Department said local police would not ask immigrants for their immigration documents. The department has a policy against enforcing immigration law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Webber, who enforces the immigration laws, noted that someone in the country illegally does run the risk of being deported. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If you are violating the law, you are exposing yourself to possible investigation,&rdquo; Webber said in response to a question about illegal immigrants recently arrested at an airport in Newark, N.J. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Green noted that the chances of getting picked up are low. Federal officials are worried mostly about protecting national security, the congressman said, &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t get in trouble with the law, you probably won&rsquo;t get picked up.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In his prepared remarks, Mexican Consul General Eduardo Ibarrola told the crowd that he had not found any evidence that the raids were happening. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Everything indicates that what we are dealing with is only rumors,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But when moderators opened the floor to questions, a few speakers criticized the consul general, accusing him of being misinformed. He responded by noting that he had never flatly denied the rumors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The consulate has not said that there are no raids,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hipolito Acosta, head of the local office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, repeatedly assured the crowd in Spanish there were no raids and was repeatedly booed in response. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of the crowd seemed to leave the meeting more convinced that the raids are taking place. At the closing of the meeting, AAMA representative and local attorney Jacob Monty thanked the crowd for coming. 
			</p>
			<p>
				From the back, someone shouted: &ldquo;Thank you for lying.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				At a news conference earlier in the day, immigrant-rights advocates said they have spent the last 11 days investigating the reports of raids. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We could not prove there were raids,&rdquo; said Fernando Garcia of the Coordinating Committee for Human Rights of Houston. &ldquo;So it appears they did not happen.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the activists noted that they did document 25 incidents that they believe caused some of the panic. They spoke with two people who reported having immigration agents appear at their address looking for a specific person. In one case, an immigrant woman who lived in the house was detained even though she was not the person agents had been seeking, the activists said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They also said they documented seven incidents in which immigration agents were spotted at worksites. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The groups said they had heard credible reports of immigration vans and buses being left in neighborhoods, perhaps to intimidate residents of mostly Latino areas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This creates the panic,&rdquo; said Omar Velez, an attorney with the immigration rights group Puerta del Sur.
