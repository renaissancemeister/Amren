				State&rsquo;s Prisons Declare a Crisis
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Department enacts emergency measures to cope with overcrowding, angering lawmakers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Evan Halper, L. A. Times, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SACRAMENTO &mdash; The state prison system has declared a state of emergency and begun triple-bunking prisoners in two-person cells in response to an increase in the number of inmates, which is approaching historical highs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a memo obtained by The Times, the Department of Corrections says 1,200 unexpected inmates, most of them destined for maximum-security facilities, are streaming in from financially strapped counties that can no longer accommodate them in their jails. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The emergency declaration took effect April 1 but was never made public. It sparked angry criticism from lawmakers who learned about it only Monday and highlighted concerns about continued cost overruns at the department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result of the declaration, the department is enacting emergency overcrowding measures in five facilities, a move likely to drive up overtime for prison guards as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to dramatically cut back on those costs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The counties are moving inmates into prison more quickly than they generally would because they have no room,&rdquo; said Margot Bach, a department spokeswoman. She said the department has yet to determine how much the extra overtime will cost. Officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department said an increase in arrests is also contributing to the overcrowding. 
			</p>
			<p>
				California has the largest state prison system in the nation. The department memo, signed by Chief Deputy Director Richard A. Rimmer, said &ldquo;spring projections indicating a decrease in population&rdquo; have not materialized. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As of April 14, there were 162,456 inmates in the state prison system, an increase of 2,592 over the same time last year. With the influx from the counties, Rimmer said the prison population &ldquo;is approaching historical highs.&rdquo;
