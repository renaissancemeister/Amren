				New Homes Block Is for &lsquo;Asians only&rsquo;
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Paul Waugh, Evening Standard, ThisisLondon, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Race watchdogs have been called in to investigate a state-of-the-art London housing block that is being reserved for Asians only. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The development, which will provide sheltered housing for 40 Muslim &ldquo;elders&rdquo; when it opens in the East End this summer, has triggered controversy because white pensioners will be excluded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Commission for Racial Equality has now been asked to check whether the Sonali Gardens project breaks the Race Relations Act. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Criticism of the project comes from both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Tories warned today that the block was a form of &ldquo;segregation&rdquo; that could be seized on by the British National Party in its bid for votes in the capital, particularly in the East End. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 40 new homes, together with a day centre, have been built in a joint project by Tower Hamlets council and Circle 33 housing association on the site of an old people&rsquo;s home that catered for all communities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Three other new sheltered housing blocks in the borough are not earmarked just for Asians. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics point out that its specialist services, such as halal meals, Bengali-speaking carers and Islamic praying facilities, could be offered within a mixedrace development. Lib-Dem councillor Janet Ludlow said: &ldquo;The most important thing is to make sure we are acting legally.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 1976 Race Relations Act and its 2000 amendment state that a discriminatory service can only be offered if an authority can prove that a specific need is not currently being met. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But a recent council report admitted that the level of need among elderly Bangladeshis was &ldquo;a hidden need&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: &ldquo;There would rightly be outrage if a council offered a whites-only housing block. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I firmly believe that we should look to achieve integration rather than segregation in our society. This is the sort of thoughtless policy that feeds extremism.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sirajul Islam, lead councillor for social services at Tower Hamlets, said: &ldquo;We certainly do not advocate segregation in Tower Hamlets. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But the &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to public services is no longer acceptable in 21st century Britain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Tower Hamlets is fortunate to have a diverse mix of communities and the council strives to ensure that its services are responsive to the differing and changing needs of its residents.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokesman for the CRE said: &ldquo;We would seek to understand the full facts of why someone was doing this and on the basis of those facts whether it was within the law or a breach of the law.&rdquo;
