				<i>Karin Roodt, censorbugbear, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				April 27, 2004 &mdash; PRETORIA, OLD BOER REPUBLICAN PARLIAMENT, CHURCH SQUARE &mdash; A group of Afrikaners and Boers hoisted the old Boer Transvaal Republican flag on Church Square in Pretoria yesterday and sang the old Boer Anthem &ldquo;Kent Gij dat Volk&rdquo; after dispersing peacefully from a jam-packed meeting in the Old Boer Republican Parliament Building (&ldquo;Ou Raadsaal&rdquo;). Police had been on hand to accept the petition drawn up for the ANC-president&rsquo;s office by the meeting. As arranged days earlier, the police undertook to deliver the ten-point petition to the newly inagurated president&rsquo;s office. Some of the people who attended the meeting carried the old Boer-Republican Vierkleur flag with them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Afrikaans newspaper Beeld however, inaccurately described this &ldquo;Vierkleur&rdquo;flag as an &ldquo;apartheid-era flag&rdquo; in their report &mdash; although the Boer Republics, which were defeated by the British colonial powers in 1902, had never had any system of apartheid whatsoever. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Apartheid was officially started in 1948, whereas the Boer Republics had been defeated 46 years earlier &mdash; in 1902. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Vierkleur was thus last hoisted officially in Pretoria in 1902 and had never had antyhing to do with apartheid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Afrikaners and Boers who had attended the jampacked, peaceful meeting were threatened by a large crowd of aggressive blacks as they dispersed yesterday. Ms Roodt reports that the hall and its galleries were so full that people were spilling over onto the sidewalk, trying to watch the proceedings inside. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside, the police were already waiting to accept the &ldquo;volksraad&rsquo;s&rdquo; official petition which was to be handed over to the president&rsquo;s office.

			<p>
				As the meeting started dispersing peacefully &mdash; with many small children and women amongst them,, and families spilling onto the sidewalk calmly walking back to their cars &mdash; a large crowd of at least 1,000 ANC-supporters, all young males and very aggressive, arrived from the railway station and started shouting insults at the Afrikaner families, such as &ldquo;Hello Dogs&rdquo; in the Nguni-language Zulu. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Afrikaners who were departing did not pay attention to them, writes Ms Roodt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Suddenly thousands more black males came running towards the Afrikaners on the sidewalk from the railway station, carrying ANC-flags and shouting insults &mdash; and the police became very tense, loading up their shotguns and putting on their bullet-proof vests,&rdquo; she writes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They asked the people who were still waiting to leave inside the Ou Raadsaal to immediately disperse, as quickly as they could, because they were afraid that they would not be able to control this large crowd of aggressive people from attacking them.&rdquo; Dan Roodt of PRAAG immediately asked everyone to leave to avoid a direct confrontation but &ldquo;it was very close&rdquo;, she writes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The people inside the hall were not afraid as they left and dispersed peacefully, carrying the Boer-Republican flags with them.&rdquo; Before this incident, at the meeting inside the hall, people were told not to support business of ethno-European South Africans who &ldquo;bend the knee before communist terrorist gangs&rdquo; by accepting name changes of historic Boer-Republic towns and villages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For instance the city of Pretoria itself &mdash; founded and built by Boers &mdash; is in the process of being unilaterally renamed Tswane after an unimportant tribal chief who had never lived in the region and had had nothing to do with its founding or building. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The largest number of ratepayers in Pretoria are Afrikaans-speakings and they have mounted large protests against the unilateral plans by the ANC-regime. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We should refuse to use new names in addresses. If they don&rsquo;t want to deliver the mail, we will do it ourselves. &ldquo;We have enough people who drive up and down,&rdquo; said Theuns de Wet of the Afrikaner Cultural Bond at the meeting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another speaker, Henk van de Graaf of the House of Orange, encouraged the audience to &ldquo;fill the cradle&rdquo; to ensure the future of &ldquo;the nation&rdquo;. When the group started singing the anthem of the old Boer Republic &mdash; &ldquo;Kent Gij Dat Volk&rdquo; &mdash; journalists who reported about this meeting did not know the historic significance &mdash; instead writing that this song came from the &ldquo;old apartheid era&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the Boer Republics never had any form of legal segregation of the races and tens of thousands of Boer women and children had died in British concentration camps before the Boers surrended to the British colonialists in 1902. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The large black crowd shouted a lot of abuse and chanted &ldquo;Viva ANC&rdquo; at the dispersing group of peaceful Afrikaners. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Journalist Jan-Jan Joubert of the Afrikaans newspapers Beeld wrote in his second-hand report that Dan Roodt had replied to them with the comment: &ldquo;viva se moer. We will be free again&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Karin Roodt said Dan never shouted &ldquo;viva se moer&rdquo; at all &mdash; and and noted that the Beeld journalist Jan-Jan Joubert had not been present, he had rewritten the report from a second-hand source, namely another journalist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This journalist alsofailed to mention that the large group of black protestors had been aggressive and insulting &mdash; and that the Afrikaners had been asked to leave by the police to prevent them from being attacked. The Beeld report instead implied that the police had asked the Afrikaners to leave because they were carrying the Boer-Republican flag with them&hellip; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Jan-Jan Joubert sounds in his report as if he was quite sorry that the huge black crowd didn&rsquo;t actually attack the group of fellow-Afrikaners. Of course children and old people would have been the first to suffer if this had happened,&rdquo; writes Karin Roodt of <a href="mailto:PRAAG.praag@yahoogroups.com"><b>PRAAG.praag@yahoogroups.com</b></a> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Beeld claimed however that &ldquo;police asked the few diehards to leave.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This Afrikaans-language newspaper&rsquo;s historically-incorrect and severely slanted story can be read on:
