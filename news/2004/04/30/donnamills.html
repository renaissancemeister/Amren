				No Other Stain
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>John Derbyshire, National Review Online, Apr. 30</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The story of Donna Mills, the black New York judge acquitted by a Bronx (that is, black and Hispanic) jury of drunk driving after backing her father&rsquo;s Rolls Royce into two parked cars, staggering out, and refusing to take a breathalyzer, reminded me of an old legal story from the days when Britain ruled Ireland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Irish juries did not always take kindly to circuit-court judges coming into their counties to try local people. They sometimes did pretty much what that Bronx jury did. The county of Limerick was, for some reason, particularly notorious for this kind of jury favoritism. There is supposed to have been a case of a defendant acquitted and sent home by the judge with the following words ringing in his ears: &ldquo;You have been found Not Guilty by a Limerick jury, and leave this court with no <i>other</i> stain on your character.&rdquo;

				Manhattan Judge Cleared in DWI Case
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>1010WINS.com, Apr. 1</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Manhattan civil court judge was acquitted Thursday of driving while intoxicated in a July 2002 incident in which she backed a Rolls-Royce into two parked cars in the Bronx. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A Bronx state Supreme Court jury deliberated over two days before clearing Justice Donna Mills, 50, of wrongdoing in the accident. Mills smiled widely as the verdict was returned and later thanked the judge and jury for a fair trial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mills was arrested around midnight July 22, 2002, in the parking lot of a Loehmann&rsquo;s department store in the Riverdale section. While trying to back out of a parking space, she struck the two cars, authorities said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A complaint by the arresting officer described her as &ldquo;unsteady on her feet,&rdquo; with bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. Prosecutor Jenna Rizzo told the jury that Mills &ldquo;reeked of alcohol&rdquo; on that night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The key witness in the case, Tracy Mendelsohn, said she spent five hours drinking with the judge before the accident. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But defense attorney Paul Gentile charged that Mills was targeted because she is black, and he accused police of lying about what happened. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If convicted, Mills, a former criminal court judge in the Bronx, could have faced up to a year behind bars and disciplinary action by the state Commission on Judicial Conduct.
