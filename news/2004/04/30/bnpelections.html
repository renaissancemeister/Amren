				<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/04/27/bnp.europe/">Euro Poll May Boost UK Far Right</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Hector Wells, CNN News, Apr. 27 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				LONDON, England (CNN) &mdash; Public unease with immigration and a proportional representation voting system have presented the far-right British National Party (BNP) with a chance of winning seats in the European elections in June. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kate Taylor of anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, which is conducting a Stop The BNP campaign, concedes there is a &ldquo;big risk&rdquo; of them making significant gains. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By analyzing results from the 1999 elections, Searchlight estimates that the BNP could gain an MEP in the north-west region by polling as little as nine percent of the vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A YouGov survey published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper in early April found that 16 percent of the British public would consider voting for the BNP. 
			</p>
			<p>
				BNP spokesman Phil Edwards says elected members to Brussels would explore the possibility of joining other, far-right MEPs from across Europe to form a voting bloc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The party is campaigning on an anti-immigration, pro-white platform in all the UK regions, and see themselves as the only viable alternative to the mainstream parties, who Phil Edwards says are &ldquo;traitors to Britain.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The party has attempted to reform itself by creating a more media-friendly image and insists it is not racist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Taylor believes the changes are superficial: &ldquo;On the surface level they&rsquo;ve got rid of a lot of the street element, but there&rsquo;s still the same old people in charge.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The makeover has seen the party ditch its policy of compulsory repatriation for non-whites and rid itself of many other links with the past &mdash; including the former leader John Tyndall, who was expelled. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a speech in Burnley, where the BNP has seven councilors, Conservative leader Michael Howard took the opportunity to remind voters of the criminal history of the party&rsquo;s top brass. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In 1998, Griffin (Nick, party leader) was found guilty of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a two-year suspended jail sentence,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He is not alone in his Party in having criminal convictions. Tony Lecomber, the Director of Group Development, has convictions under the Explosives Act. He was also imprisoned for wounding a Jewish teacher whom he beat up on the day of the BNP&rsquo;s annual conference in 1990,&rdquo; he added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In spite of these stubborn, historical stains, observers say the BNP can win votes if they remain focused on their main campaign issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The UK has been the top recipient of asylum claims within the European Union since 2000, and in spite of a worldwide fall in levels, had more claims (61,050) in 2003 than any other industrialized country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Stories of bogus claimants and passport fraud in Britain&rsquo;s press have made the Labour government extremely wary, and vulnerable &mdash; immigration minister Beverley Hughes resigned after becoming entangled in a Romanian visa scandal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tony Blair ordered government auditors to check asylum figures in the wake of Hughes&rsquo; resignation, but observers say he faces an uphill struggle to convince voters of his determination to deal with the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eighty percent of respondents in the newspaper survey said the government were not hard enough on immigration and asylum-seekers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Against this background it&rsquo;s easy to see how the BNP&rsquo;s policies might appeal to a section of the population. Phil Edwards says the party &ldquo;will give a voice to the public who are concerned with uncontrolled immigration.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The BNP&rsquo;s only previous successes have been at local level where they have 17 councilors, but they have been unable to break through on a national or European level. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Far-right parties in continental Europe have had greater success. Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the Front National party, reached the second round of the French presidential election in 2002. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Austria, the FPO (formerly headed by Joerg Haider) is a member of the government coalition, as are the National Alliance and Northern League in Italy. Vlaams Blok of Belgium and Front National have MEPs in Brussels. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The hysteria surrounding the immigration debate and historically low voter turn-outs could work in the BNP&rsquo;s favor, but Kate Taylor says &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t have that level of social acceptability&rdquo; and hopes traditional British values of tolerance and social conservatism will hold. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Culturally Britain has far less extremist views when it comes to voting.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The election is on 10 June.
