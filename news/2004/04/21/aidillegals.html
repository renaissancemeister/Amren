				Volunteers Plan to Aid Migrants in Desert
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Stephanie Innes, Arizona Daily Star, Apr. 20</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				PHOENIX &mdash; Inspired by the biblical lesson of welcoming the stranger, volunteers are planning to staff round-the-clock desert camps to aid illegal border crossers coming into Southern Arizona this summer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The &ldquo;Arks of the Covenant&rdquo; desert camps, which will provide water, food and medical help, are part of a larger effort by Arizona&rsquo;s religious groups to curb what has become a crisis of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexican border on foot only to die of heat exposure and thirst. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;All our efforts are within the federal provisions of humanitarian assistance,&rdquo; said the Rev. John Fife, pastor of Southside Presbyterian Church, 317 W. 23rd St. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Andy Adame, a representative of the Tucson sector of the U.S. Border Patrol, said he couldn&rsquo;t comment on the planned volunteer desert camps because he did not know enough about them. Federal law prohibits anyone from aiding illegal immigrants &ldquo;in furtherance of their illegal entry,&rdquo; including sheltering them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fife was one of at least 150 religious leaders from across the state who gathered on the lawn of the Arizona Capitol Monday morning to sign a statement of solidarity against the federal government&rsquo;s border policy. The leaders agreed on a list of policy recommendations and pledged to step up education of their parishioners about the annual string of deaths in the desert. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Today we put our faith into practice,&rdquo; said Jorg&eacute; Montiel, a parishioner at St. Andrew the Apostle Catholic Church in Chandler and a member of the East Valley Interfaith organization. &ldquo;Our spirituality includes shaping public policy.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some leaders at Monday&rsquo;s gathering said the show of solidarity recalled the Sanctuary movement of the 1980s, when churches and other religious groups aided people fleeing war-torn Central America. The movement began in Tucson but quickly spread nationwide. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is a big deal,&rdquo; Fife said of the current effort. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But this time, Fife said, the movement is acting within the law. In the 1980s, Sanctuary workers helped smuggle the immigrants into the country, resulting in a federal felony conviction for Fife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Organizers say the Arks of the Covenant will be set up on Memorial Day weekend and will remain at least through July. The camps&rsquo; locations had not been determined. Fife said it is a version of the existing faith-based Samaritan Patrol, a program beginning its third year of sending teams in vehicles into the desert to offer food, water and medical help to border crossers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Christian Peacemaker teams will provide between six and eight people to staff at least one of the Ark camps, said Rich Meyer, a member of the international organization. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Sometimes the example of church leaders can lead the government to change laws,&rdquo; Meyer said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;As Arizonans, we have a special responsibility to reach out to and welcome our brothers and sisters as members of God&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; Gerald F. Kicanas, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson, told Monday&rsquo;s gathering. &ldquo;We cannot remain silent as these deaths continue to mount on our doorstep.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Tucson Sector of the Border Patrol reported 139 deaths in the desert for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2003.
