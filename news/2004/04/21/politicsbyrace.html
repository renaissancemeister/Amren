				Nonwhites in California Underrepresented in Civic Participation
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Justin Pritchard, AP, sacbee.com, Apr. 21</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SAN FRANCISCO (AP) &mdash; It&rsquo;s not just Election Day. Nonwhite Californians are underrepresented in nearly every phase of the daily civic-political process, from attending rallies to writing campaign checks, a sweeping new study reports. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, the disproportionate political influence white Californians wield in a state where they are no longer a majority is unlikely to change for a generation, according to researchers at the San Francisco-based Public Policy Institute of California. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The situation already involves significant racial inequality,&rdquo; said Karthick Ramakrishnan, lead author of the study on public participation released Wednesday. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s significant about this report is that we can see these trends persisting.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Historically, whites have been more likely to vote than nonwhites. That has held in recent years, when about 60 percent of white adult Californians say they vote, while it&rsquo;s closer to 50 percent of blacks and 40 percent of Hispanics or Asians, according to the study. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the disparities went beyond voting. The study used a survey of more than 5,000 Californians to highlight stark differences by race in a range of grassroots activities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whites were up to twice as likely as Hispanics, blacks or Asians to sign petitions, write elected officials, contribute to a campaign, attend a rally or volunteer for a political party. Whites also were almost twice as likely to volunteer for nonpolitical organizations as Asians of Latinos &mdash; though their rate was only 30 percent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though whites make up less than 50 percent of the state population, they represented 63 percent of California&rsquo;s total adult citizens in 2002. Even so, they accounted for roughly 70 percent of all the political activity the study measured. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The consequences go beyond egalitarian ideals. Whites often set the political table in California and may decide &ldquo;what are legitimate issues, and what are not legitimate issues,&rdquo; said Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the flip side were Hispanics, the state&rsquo;s second largest group but one that hasn&rsquo;t yet asserted political clout commensurate with its numbers. Though Hispanics were more likely than any group &mdash; including whites &mdash; to attend meetings on local or school issues, they were less likely to participate in every other aspect of the democratic process. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The study&rsquo;s broad findings roughly track what&rsquo;s known nationally about civic-political participation rates among nonwhites. But in California, the issue is even more significant because of how heavily the state relies on ballot initiatives to craft public policy, Ramakrishnan said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While Hispanics will rally against a perceived injustice such as the denial of benefits or drivers&rsquo; licenses to undocumented immigrants, they are not proactively crafting an agenda, according to Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, D-Los Angeles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We know very clearly what we&rsquo;re against, I think we have a much more difficult time defining what we&rsquo;re in favor of,&rdquo; Nunez said. &ldquo;Obviously, we need to do a better job to encourage young people to be involved.&rdquo;
