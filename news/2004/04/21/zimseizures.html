				Zim: More Prime Farm Land Seized and Machinery Confiscated
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Caiphas Chimhete, Zimbabwe Standard, Apr. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				While government says its land reform programme has been successfully completed, fresh farm seizures and confiscation of farm equipment from the few remaining white commercial farmers continue unabated in what analysts see as an election subterfuge to keep the emotive land issue alive until next year&rsquo;s general elections. Mired in controversy over multiple farm ownership and other improprieties exposed in a government inquiry led by former secretary to the Cabinet, Charles Utete, analysts say the land redistribution drive has taken a dive and Zanu PF is keen on &ldquo;firing-up&rdquo; the campaign in its quest to ensnare gullible voters ahead of the crucial 2005 plebiscite. But they were quick to warn that the move is likely to frustrate efforts by newly appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono to win back the confidence of international investors in the country&rsquo;s economic policies. In complete defiance of a provisional High Court order granted by Justice Karwi in February, the army and riot police last week sealed off Charleswood Estate, owned by opposition MDC legislator Roy Bennett. On the same day, scores of heavily armed riot police, the army and members of the dreaded Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) allegedly brutalised and evicted farm workers from Kondozi Farm in Odzi. Both are productive and export their produce, bringing in the much-needed foreign currency. As if to demonstrate its renewed vigour in expropriating more land, the government last week announced that it would acquire at least 49 sugar cane estates in the Lowveld. The estates are part of Hippo Valley Estates, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s largest sugar producer. &ldquo;The latest farm seizures are a blow to government&rsquo;s own efforts to resuscitate the economy and efforts to regain international confidence which we desperately need,&rdquo; said a University of Zimbabwe political scientist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His sentiments were echoed by Transparency International Zimbabwe (TIZ) chairman, John Makumbe, a known critic of Mugabe&rsquo;s administration. He said the current seizures by Zanu PF are meant to sustain the land exercise into 2005 as part of electioneering but the timing could work against the country&rsquo;s economic revival efforts. &ldquo;Zanu PF&rsquo;s timing is unbelievable and worrying, Gono is trying to woo the IMF and World Bank but on the other hand the government is shooting itself in the foot for the sake of winning an election,&rdquo; said Makumbe, also a University of Zimbabwe political scientist. Gono last month publicly pleaded with the international community, including the IMF and the World Bank &mdash; which Mugabe at one time said Zimbabwe could do without &mdash; insisting that the country needed foreign assistance to revive its collapsing economy. Lovemore Madhuku, another University of Zimbabwe law lecturer, said Mugabe wants to keep the land issue &ldquo;as a permanent item on his agenda&rdquo; until next year and would use it as an &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; to perpetrate human rights abuses to consolidate his rule. If he (Mugabe) stops the land grab there will be no justification or excuse for human rights abuses, especially against white farmers accused of supporting the opposition MDC,&rdquo; said the lecturer. He added that the on-going land seizures were &ldquo;a mopping up exercise&rdquo; after Zanu PF realised there were some white farmers, who had set up blacks as fronts in an effort to keep their properties. Another analyst said: &ldquo;The attempt to politicise the land redistribution process at this juncture is total misreading of where we are as Zimbabwe by Zanu PF. We are tired of the black and white rhetoric which is being peddled everyday.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Others believe renewed farm seizures could work against Mugabe&rsquo;s election plans, as more people &mdash; even within Zanu PF circles &mdash; are sympathetic with the evicted farm workers, many of whom know no other home away from the farms. In the case of Kondozi Farm and Charleswood, workers were brutalised by riot police, evicted from the properties and dumped on the roadside. &ldquo;Generally, farm workers are not happy with the way the issue of land has been handled because most of them have not benefited. Apart from that they are being brutalised by the police and thrown out of their homes. It&rsquo;s a constituency Mugabe is losing,&rdquo; said an official with a local non-governmental organisation that deals with farm workers. Commenting on the eviction of workers from Kondozi and Charleswood Farms, University of Zimbabwe political commentator Heneri Dzinotyiwei said matters concerning harmless civilians should be dealt with by the police and not the army. He said that under normal circumstances, the army should only be summoned to deal with riotous or armed people and not a handful of defenceless farm workers. &ldquo;Generally, every country would want to be cautious when dealing with incidents of this nature because it would be dangerous to create the impression to the international community that we are using the army for duties that the police can handle,&rdquo; said Dzinotyiwei. Mugabe&rsquo;s critics say while his continued land and equipment grab may may help him gain political mileage, it is most certainly going to worsen the country&rsquo;s food situation. Zimbabwe, already in the throes of a serious food shortage, will be forced to import huge qualities of food this year despite the relatively good rains. &ldquo;We will definitely run out of food because the government has seized land and agricultural equipment but it can not seize expertise. We will import food for the foreseeable future,&rdquo;said Makumbe.
