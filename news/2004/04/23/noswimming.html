			<h1>
				North Miami PD Drops Requirement in Bid to Recruit Blacks
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>AP, Local10.com (Miami), Apr. 23 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				NORTH MIAMI, Fla. &mdash; The North Miami police department dropped a swimming requirement for applicants, saying they need new officers and want to encourage blacks to sign up. 
			</p>
			<p>
				North Miami Police Department swimming requirement survey Do you agree with the department&rsquo;s decision to eliminate its swimming requirement? Thank you for participating in our Local10.com survey. Yes No North Miami police say they are dropping the requirement for a year. They say few departments require swimming and their officers rarely save people in water. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our swimming requirement may give the false perception that we are not serious in our efforts to hire Haitian police applicants,&rdquo; police chief Gwendolyn Boyd-Savage wrote in a memo explaining the decision. Boyd-Savage is black. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They have been intimidated because they don&rsquo;t swim, very few of them swim,&rdquo; said Mayor Joe Celestin, who is Haitian-American. &ldquo;They have the ability to learn how to swim, but many of them are not that great of a swimmer as the standard, current requirement that we have. We want to bring them in and give them a chance to learn.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The requirement is for police recruits to swim 150 feet without stopping while wearing all clothing except shoes, assistant police chief Doug Brown said Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Critics say race and ethnicity are not factors when it comes to swimming. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Assistant Police Chief Doug Brown said, &ldquo;We are not here to make any type of cultural assessments. We are looking to attract both minority and non-minority candidates who would normally not apply.&rdquo;
