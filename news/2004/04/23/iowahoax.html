				Victim Becomes Suspect in Alleged Hate Crime
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Former Housemate Accused Of Terrorizing Family 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>TheIowaChannel.com, Apr. 23 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				DES MOINES, Iowa &mdash; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A case of alleged hate crime in Des Moines has a bizarre ending. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several times over the winter, the Hermasillo family (pictured, left) thought they were the targets of hate crimes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two of the family&rsquo;s cars were set on fire and their house at 317 S.W. Watrous Ave. in Des Moines was broken into and vandalized. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The house was a mess, graffitti on the walls &mdash; KKK, wetbacks, go back to Mexico &mdash; on the door here, was a Nazi sign,&rdquo; Luis Silva told KCCI in February. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Silva (pictured, right) lived in the house with the Hermasillo family, but he was later kicked out of the house. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Des Moines police now say Silva is accused of doing the vandalism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He fabricated everything,&rdquo; Sgt. Tony Steverson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Steverson said Silva burned cars and vandalized the Hermasillo&rsquo;s home in an effort to convince the family he was needed as protection. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Silva is charged with arson, stalking, criminal mischief and filing false police reports. He is being held in the Polk County Jail.
