			<h1>
				Teacher Ousted for Own Safety
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Allison L. Bruce, Post and Courier, Charleston.Net, Apr. 22</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A teacher who spoke out about problems at Brentwood Middle School was told to leave Wednesday for her own safety. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Elizabeth Kandrac was told to pack her things and was put on paid leave for the rest of the academic year. The decision came a day after Kandrac found that someone had punctured the tires on the bicycle she rides to school every day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				District officials confirmed Wednesday that Kandrac was put on administrative leave with pay because of safety concerns. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We feel like it&rsquo;s the best thing for the entire school environment,&rdquo; said Rod Spaulding, spokesman for the district. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kandrac had learned the previous week that she was not invited back to teach next year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All of it, she believes, is tied to her outspokenness about problems at the school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the beginning of April, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the state&rsquo;s Human Affairs Commission, citing several incidents in which she was threatened or assaulted by students. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kandrac said students used foul language and misbehaved. One threw a desk at her. She said the school&rsquo;s administration did not follow through on her discipline referrals and criticized her for asking for help too often. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since she filed the complaint, the school administration has jumped to take action on her discipline referrals, she said. She also has not been left alone in her classroom, something she said was done to ensure her safety. So she was surprised when she was told to pack. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Brentwood has a reputation for being a tough school with a history of academic shortcomings and discipline problems. Some criticize the school&rsquo;s administration for not making the necessary changes to turn the school around. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last school year, about 61 percent of the school&rsquo;s students were suspended at least once, and 3.4 percent of the students were expelled. Brentwood was one of 22 Charleston County schools selected for a grant because they had problems with school suspensions, expulsions, violent and criminal incidents and academics. Brentwood also had an unsatisfactory state report card. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A state team reviewed the school this year and recommended that the principal be replaced with a principal specialist next year who would be paid by the state. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kandrac is not the only teacher at Brentwood to file a discrimination complaint recently. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Science teacher John Smith filed a complaint this week, saying he was discriminated against by the school&rsquo;s administration. He also was not invited back to Brentwood for next year and said he was told he didn&rsquo;t fit in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Both teachers are white at the predominately black school, and both cite race as an issue in their complaints against the administration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Smith is retired military, but even serving as a submarine chief didn&rsquo;t prepare him for the middle school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I had no idea it would be like this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The troublemakers lack any self-discipline and respect for adults and teachers and for each other.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Smith said he didn&rsquo;t receive the kind of threats that Kandrac did and wasn&rsquo;t concerned about his safety. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said he finally felt like he was starting to connect with his students before the winter break. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I want to continue that. I want to help these kids,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that I&rsquo;ve been treated right.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who complain about discipline problems said their main concern is the environment it creates for students. Teachers cannot teach and students cannot learn. Both are constantly worried about being cursed at or assaulted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The teachers do the best they can, but they don&rsquo;t get the support they need,&rdquo; said Deborah Mood-Hardeman, who left Brentwood after stress from the job precipitated a heart attack. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The discipline was just awful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To buzz the office was a waste of time. They weren&rsquo;t going to come.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some students say there isn&rsquo;t a discipline problem. Some say the reason students act up is because the teachers make them mad. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They&rsquo;re cruel and rude to us,&rdquo; one student said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Charleston County school board member Hillery Douglas said Brentwood is like any other middle school that has students making the transition from childhood to the teen years. He said he hadn&rsquo;t heard that Brentwood had any more discipline problems than any other middle school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You will have some of them acting out,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Parent Kim Bennett said her eighth-grade son has not had problems. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He never comes home and says there is any violence (or) any reason to be afraid,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Bennett criticized the school&rsquo;s principal for not making needed changes at the school. &ldquo;The teachers, what they&rsquo;re trying to get out is (that) they are under poor leadership,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert Patterson, whose granddaughter is an eighth-grader at the school, said he has heard some students talking back to teachers or using foul language. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to come to school to learn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				School nurse Beth Jones described the school as &ldquo;total chaos.&rdquo; Jones worked at Brentwood last year but works at a different school now. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said the problems at Brentwood are even more apparent after seeing a well-run school. She remembers teachers at Brentwood coming to her after a stressful day to have their blood pressure checked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many students never went to class, but simply hung around school all day, she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The decibel level in the halls when there was supposed to be class going on &hellip; it was unbelievable for a school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was very hard for me to do my work in that environment. In my opinion, there&rsquo;s no way a child could concentrate.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said she supports Kandrac&rsquo;s push to create a better school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;School needs to be a safe haven,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That place is totally out of control.&rdquo;
