			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Allan Little, BBC News, Apr. 17 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>&ldquo;Trafficking in human beings&rdquo; is a phrase guaranteed to cause a sharp intake of breath among listeners from the liberal and affluent and concerned West. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The view of trafficking in Nigeria is somewhat different. In fact, it is seen as an everyday part of West African life. </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				It starts with the promise of a better life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The parents are taken in. The children are persuaded. When they leave home they do so willingly, with some excitement, not trepidation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The trafficker has promised a good job, a schooling, a regular income. But that is not how it works out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One young woman told me she was promised regular work in the Nigerian countryside. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Discernible shame </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				She found herself transported overland through the north of Nigeria, to Mali, then to Algeria, then Morocco. 
			</p>
			<p>
				From there she was smuggled into Spain, at night, in a small boat, and from there, on forged papers, into Italy by train. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They took her to a house in Turin where she lived with other girls, some, but not all, Nigerian like her, and under the control of a madam, also Nigerian. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She was put to work as a prostitute, something she speaks of now with a discernible shame. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After seven months she had earned enough money to pay off what she owed the traffickers for taking her in the first place. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The streets of Nigeria are teeming with trafficked children </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				When that debt was paid, her trafficker shopped her to the Italian immigration authorities and she was repatriated, home to Benin City, Nigeria with nothing to show for her ordeal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There was a second young woman with a similar story. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not yet out of her teens, her traffickers took her to Verona where she worked as a prostitute. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She spoke without shame. She spoke with anger. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Just when I had paid off my debt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just when I was about to start working for myself, the police caught me.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the pattern. The traffickers do not want their working girls setting up on their own, taking custom away from their girls. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Turnover &mdash; in human traffic &mdash; is everything. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Oil rich cities </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unicef estimates that human trafficking is more lucrative than any other trade in West Africa except guns and drugs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The streets of Nigeria are teeming with trafficked children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the hundreds of thousands of street kids living rough in Nigeria&rsquo;s oil rich cities, perhaps 40% have been bought and sold at some time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The girls most frequently sold into domestic service, or prostitution, the boys into labour in plantations, or to hawk fruit and vegetables for 12-hours a day in an open air market. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some work as washers of feet. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Nigeria children enter the labour market almost as soon as they can lift and carry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We watched a skinny boy in a dust bowl of a quarry carrying stone blocks on his head ferrying them from where they were cut from the earth to where they were broken down into usable pieces for the construction industry. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He worked here alongside his heavily pregnant mother. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He earned 40p (70 US cents) a day, which his mother used to buy food for her five younger children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy was nine-years-old and he had been working at the quarry since he was seven. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unicef believe there are 15 million children working in exploitative labour in Nigeria. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a 21st century slave trade. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What is most striking is the tacit support that human trafficking enjoys at almost every level of society. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Trafficking has the tacit collaboration of the victims&rsquo; own families </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Lagos middle class have a bountiful supply of house boys and house girls, brought from villages in the north by helpful aunts and uncles who pocket the cash and disappear. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No-one asks questions. No-one wants to know the answers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For human trafficking is not something that happens on the criminal fringes of Nigerian society. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It is woven into the fabric of national life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Benin City, in the oil rich Edo state, east of Lagos, I met an articulate 15-year-old girl who said many of her friends had been trafficked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Their parents are involved,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They say to the girls: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go with this man and work. We have no money, we have nothing to eat. You can send us money.&rsquo; And so the girls go.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				And that is the problem. That trafficking has the tacit collaboration of the victims&rsquo; own families. That it is not seen as criminal activity at all but as a normal and even respectable way for a family of &mdash; say &mdash; seven or eight children to boost its meagre income. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Root cause </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have filmed for BBC television news in many countries of Africa over the last decade. But I have never had an Oscar winning Hollywood movie producer carry my tripod before. 
			</p>
			<p>
				David Puttnam &mdash; who made Chariots of Fire, Midnight Express, The Killing Fields &mdash; knows a lot about trafficking. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As president of Unicef UK he has seen it across Asia as well as in Africa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What frustrates him here, in Nigeria, more than the poverty that is its root cause, is the attitude that accompanies it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Half of you feels sympathy,&rdquo; he told me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;But the other half wants just to shake the people here and say look &mdash; this is a large, wealthy, powerful country. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Put the structures in place. Develop some determination. And this exploitation of children could be tackled and Nigeria could be a really successful nation&rdquo;.

				<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3652021.stm">Scale Of African Slavery Revealed</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>BBC News, Apr. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The trafficking of human beings is a problem in every African country, says the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (Unicef). </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report, which covers 53 African nations, says children are the biggest victims in what is a very complex phenomenon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It describes how they are forced into slavery, recruited as child soldiers or sold into prostitution. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In Africa, children are twice as likely to be trafficked as women. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Trade </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The BBC&rsquo;s Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the report found that 89% of the countries had trafficking to and from neighbouring countries, but 34% also had a human trade to Europe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Poverty, traditional migration and conflict are blamed for the traffic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The trade in people is frequently regional. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the countries surveyed, 26% said trafficking was taking place to the Middle East. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And the trade is often in both directions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nigeria, for example, has received trafficked people from 12 African countries, but trafficked Nigerians have been found in a dozen countries too. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Complicity </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Much of this trade in children often has the tacit collaboration of the victims&rsquo; own families where it is seen not so much as criminal activity but as a way for a large family to boost its poor income. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The story of Joseph in Benin is fairly typical. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When he was 13 years old, a stranger arranged with his parents for him to go to neighbouring Togo for a better life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, he was put to work from 0500 to 2300 each day as a domestic help and was regularly beaten. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It took him three years of saving money to be able to phone home and be rescued by an uncle. Now 16 years old, he is back in school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I was so happy to see my little brother again when I returned home to Benin,&rdquo; he says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Complexity </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report&rsquo;s director, Andrea Rossi, says trafficking is a complex issue with many causes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Trafficking can start as slavery, children and women are sold, but it can also start as a migration process where children want to move. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The only way they have to move &mdash; because for example it&rsquo;s illegal, because you cannot move, or it&rsquo;s difficult &mdash; the only option they have is to go through trafficking patterns.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are no reliable figures for just how many people are trafficked in Africa, but it is likely to run into the millions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unicef is presenting its report to a meeting of African ministers in Benin. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The hope is to adopt an action plan to combat trafficking, one which will place the rights of the child at the centre of all future policy.
