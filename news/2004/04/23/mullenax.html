				A Racial Double Standard

				Dave&rsquo;s Diatribe &mdash; Unfair and Unbalanced 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i><a href="mailto:david@davesdiatribe.com">David Mullenax</a>, Augusta Free Press, Apr. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				I confess that I&rsquo;m a news junkie. Each and every morning, I browse numerous local, state and national newspapers. Now, I don&rsquo;t read them all, but I peruse the topics and headlines that are appealing or attention-grabbing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You&rsquo;d be surprised by how many remarkable and controversial stories you never hear about. Yet earlier this month, a story appeared in every local media outlet in the Harrisonburg area, and no one could possibly have missed it. Personally, I heard it on the morning news, on the radio driving to work <i>and</i> read about it in the paper later that day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The story, which garnered so much attention, was of a flyer distribution by a white-nationalist organization known as The National Alliance. Flyers, or handbills, as they are officially called, were placed on residents&rsquo; lawns with the image of a blonde, white woman and the words &ldquo;Love Your Race.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Also printed on the flyer were the organizations name and a Web address. That&rsquo;s all there was to it. Nothing more, nothing less. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea of someone placing flyers in a person&rsquo;s driveway is really not that exciting, when you think about. Our family receives handbills all the time &mdash; from lawn-mowing services, cleaning services, chimney sweeping, painting, etc. My all-time favorite was when we received one telling us we were going to burn in a pool of fire for all eternity, never to escape, if we didn&rsquo;t change our ways and visit the local church. In reality, though, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. The distributors weighted the leaflet down with a rock painted with snail images, so we ended up receiving a free lawn ornament. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there was something else about the local media stories that drew my attention. It was a resident&rsquo;s reaction to the innocent and harmless act of distributing flyers. While walking her dog, a local resident discovered the flyers and was &ldquo;annoyed and disturbed.&rdquo; In order to spare her neighbors from the same anxiety caused by the &ldquo;offensive and racist&rdquo; material, she proceeded to pick up as many flyers as she could. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the point when I start to ask myself questions. Why would a person, telling someone to take pride in their ethnic identity, be labeled <i>racist</i>? Why does the press celebrate ethnic-minority solidarity, but slander white solidarity? Are they not aware of the racial double standard they promote without an ounce of effort to conceal it? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless of one&rsquo;s race, I can&rsquo;t think of a more honorable thing to do than to promote identity, community and empowerment among one&rsquo;s own ethnic group. African-Americans, Hispanics, Jewish groups and now even those of an alternative sexual orientation are encouraged to celebrate what is unique about them, but the same lack of identity is denied &mdash; in terms of acceptability &mdash; to those that are white. Sounds like supremacism by minorities, if you ask me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, on the cover of the March 15, 2004, issue of <i>Business Week</i>, an article appeared entitled &ldquo;Hispanic Nation: Is America ready?&rdquo; In the lead story, Maria Velzaquez stated that she sends her children to Valle de Guadalupe, a small town in Mexico, at least once a year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that they (her children) know where they&rsquo;re from, that their connected to their roots,&rdquo; she said. Really? Is there any difference between that and &ldquo;Love Your Race&rdquo;? Not at all, but the press heralds the Mexican community for their ethnic ties while slandering and degrading whites when they practice the same <i>positive</i> message. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even the AARP commissioned a study by the Gallup organization to question Americans of different ethnicities on civil rights. When asked how they felt regarding whites being a minority in the year 2050, 25 percent of respondents said they were excited. What? Fire and brimstone would rain down from the heavens if a white American said publicly that they were excited that the African-American population was regressing in America. Americans of <i>all</i> ethnic backgrounds would demand their firing, make hate-crime accusations and gather in mob-like fashion necessitating penance. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a test case, I would love to see the NAACP, Nation of Islam or the Anti-Defamation League distribute flyers in neighborhoods with an image of an African or Middle Eastern woman on it and the words &ldquo;Love Your Race.&rdquo; How would the press and, most importantly, citizens react? Want to bet that not a single person would be caught on television proclaiming how offended, annoyed and disturbed they were? I will also bet you that it wouldn&rsquo;t make the local news, radio stations or newspapers. However, if it did, reassured residents would tell you how culturally enriching it was to receive such a flyer and how blessed by diversity everyone has become. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet if a white person says the same thing &mdash; as happened here recently &mdash; about his or her race, they are labeled a bigot, racist, xenophobe or the dreaded &ldquo;N&rdquo; word. That would be the word &ldquo;Nazi,&rdquo; and not the other one you can&rsquo;t say in public without having Al Sharpton, Jessee Jackson or Abraham Foxman show up on your doorstep with more than a friendly flyer.
