			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Matthew Cella, The Washington Times, Apr. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A new D.C. law directs city agencies to produce their documents in a variety of languages for about 38,000 residents who do not speak or read English well. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the Language Access Act, city agencies must provide translation services in languages spoken by at least 500 residents or by at least 3 percent of persons a given agency serves or is likely to serve, whichever is less. Translation services will not be provided for smaller groups of residents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				City officials estimate that the translation services will cost $440,000 a year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think all these issues, language access, voting access, that I support, all these things are important in recognizing that immigration is the glory of our country, and it&rsquo;s added to the vitality and the diversity of our city,&rdquo; said Mayor Anthony A. Williams, who signed the act into law Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of the Springfield-based nonprofit English First, said language-access laws provide no incentive for immigrants to learn the language of their new homeland and encourage them to use the language they are most comfortable with. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When the government says, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a translation,&rsquo; what are people who speak both languages going to do?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What happens is, governments give people a false sense of security.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The new law calls for the hiring of three full-time workers in the D.C. Office of Human Rights, which will coordinate the program. In addition, a part-time language coordinator will be assigned at each of the city&rsquo;s agencies. A portion of each coordinator&rsquo;s salary was figured in to cost estimates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, interpreters will be provided for speakers of all languages, whether that means hiring bilingual staff members, contracting private or telephone interpreter programs or using publicly funded interpreters in community-service programs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neither the Office of Human Rights, nor D.C. Council member Jim Graham, Ward 1 Democrat and sponsor of the language-access bill, returned calls seeking information about the number of languages for which translation services will be provided. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to data from the D.C. public school system, more than 113 different languages are spoken by city residents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 2000 U.S. census showed that 90,417 &mdash; or 16.8 percent &mdash; of the District&rsquo;s 539,658 residents speak a language other than English at home. Of those, 38,236 &mdash; or 7.1 percent &mdash; indicated they speak English less than &ldquo;very well.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Boulet said that when language-access laws do not provide translation services to speakers of more obscure languages, as the District&rsquo;s law does not, they belie their purpose, since those persons are likely to be more isolated and more in need of public services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He also said language-access laws also open jurisdictions to liability lawsuits stemming from inaccurate translations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The more important a benefit or a service, the more exacting a translation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is going to be litigation.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Implementation of the law will be staggered over 31/2 years. In addition to staff salaries, additional costs will include $60,000 in written translation services, estimated at $60 per page, for an estimated 1,000 pages of government documents each year above what agencies already produce in different languages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Implementing the law will cost $140,000 for the remainder of this year, according to a fiscal-impact statement prepared in February by the D.C. Office of the Chief Financial Officer. The cost will rise to $300,000 next year, $370,000 in 2006 and $440,000 in 2007, when all agencies must provide translation services. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Each agency with a language coordinator also will be required to collect updated information on the number of limited-English-speaking persons it serves.
