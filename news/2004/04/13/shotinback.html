				Black-on-White Murder from <i>America &lsquo;s Most Wanted</i> 
			</h1>
			<p>
				Malaika Tamu Griffin is wanted for the murder of 25-year-old Jason Horsely. In the winter/spring of 1999, Griffin was renting a room in a house next door to Horsely and his girlfriend, Deborah Loiselle. On April 20, 1999, Loiselle had her first encounter with Griffin as the two women were standing in their front yards separated by a fence. Loiselle says Griffin, whom she&rsquo;d never seen nor met before the day, immediately threatened to kill her dogs and began cursing and hurling racial slurs. Horsely and Loiselle are white. Griffin is black. Over the next 28 days, Griffin had several other run-ins with Horsely and Loiselle that they say she initiated over parking on the public street and Horsely unloading his tools on the public sidewalk in front of her house. 
			</p>
			<p>
				None of the arguments made any sense to Horsely and Loiselle because they insist they never trespassed on her property and the parking spaces should have never been a matter of dispute because Griffin didn&rsquo;t ever own a car. Griffin&rsquo;s car had been repossessed. On the evening of May 18, 1999, Horsely was organizing his carpentry tools on the sidewalk in front of Griffin&rsquo;s house when she came outside and began screaming at him. Loiselle heard the commotion and came out of her house to stick up for Horsely. After a brief, but intense argument, both women stormed back into their respective homes and Horsely continued organizing his tools. Police say Griffin came back outside minutes later, armed with a laser-sighted 9mm pistol, and shot Horsely in the back at point-blank range. He never saw her coming. The bullet pierced Horsely&rsquo;s heart and killed him almost instantly.

				Then, detectives say, Griffin ran to the home of an acquaintance, Monique Thomas, and carjacked her at gunpoint. Griffin abandoned the car in Iowa and hopped a bus to Chicago where her trail went cold. When police searched Griffin&rsquo;s room in Denver, they were shocked to find a stockpile of ammunition, diffused hand grenades, a 9mm assault rifle and books commonly associated with terrorists, The Anarchists&rsquo; Cookbook and The Poor Man&rsquo;s James Bond. They also found spiral notebooks full of Griffin&rsquo;s secret writings about a coming race war and the killing of white people. None of her colleagues or close friends ever heard her express the types of racist rhetoric she wrote about in her notebooks. Griffin is a world-traveled lady with a Magna Cum Laude degree in chemistry. She has worked in laboratories and a pharmacy in the past.
