				The Left Seizes &lsquo;The Alamo&rsquo; 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Don Feder, FrontPageMagazine.com, Apr. 13</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are episodes in America&rsquo;s history that deserve to be retold to each generation as examples of the patriotism, heroism and the sacrifices made to keep us free &mdash; Valley Forge, Gettysburg, Bataan, D-Day, Iwo Jima and The Alamo. Of these, the Alamo is perhaps the most tragic, and the most inspiring &mdash; doomed men who willingly went to their deaths for the cause of liberty. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some day, a movie may be made which does justice to their struggle &mdash; some day, not now. The Disney remake, released on Friday, is a disappointment in every way imaginable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It is as inauthentic and foolish as the 1960 John Wayne-version. But, while the earlier film at least tried to deliver a pro-American message, the updated &ldquo;Alamo&rdquo; is both marred by political correctness and devoid of even a hint of patriotism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s as if those associated with the film (Ron Howard, among others) couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of portraying a group of pioneers nobly, and so had to throw in the standard litany of America&rsquo;s sins. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus we have Jim Bowie&rsquo;s slave telling another black man, when the hopelessness of the situation is grasped: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough that we have to fetch their water; we don&rsquo;t have to die for them!&rdquo; Hollywood could make a movie set in fourth century Bulgaria and still find a way to insert a message on the unparalleled evils of American slavery. For the record, a freedman fought and died with the other Alamo defenders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There&rsquo;s also a scene where Tejano (Spanish Texan) volunteers survey a group of rowdy Texians (AKA, white men behaving predictably). One of the former comments in Spanish: &ldquo;Santa Anna just wants to rule Mexico, these disgraces want to take over the world.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But if the Tejanos felt that way, what were they doing <i>inside </i>the Alamo? Among those who died defending the old Spanish mission were men with names like Juan Badillo, Carlos Esparza, Antonio Fuentes and Jose Maria Guerrero. I doubt any of them thought their comrades-in-arms were rapacious SOBs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As they face the final assault, Davy Crockett (improbably portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton) recounts a massacre of defenseless Indians during the Creek War, as if to say, &ldquo;You think Santa Anna&rsquo;s bad? Well, what about the way we treated the Indians?&rdquo; In this latest Disney revisionism, the Alamo is besieged by political correctness and multiculturalism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Equally inevitable, given Hollywood&rsquo;s politics, is the absence of a discernible message in the midst of this blood and bravery. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly 200 men chose death over surrender. Why? The film is silent on the subject &mdash; other than offering travelogue commentary on the scenic wonders of Texas and some last words expressing familial devotion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As Disney demonstrated with its preposterous &ldquo;Pearl Harbor,&rdquo; Hollywood has a pathological aversion to expressions of patriotism. Because it finds America (both in history and today) unlovable, it can&rsquo;t imagine anyone loving America enough to die for her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, while it&rsquo;s easy for Hollywood to deliver tedious lectures on the evils of slavery or mistreatment of the Indians, it&rsquo;s impossible for screenwriters to make a case for America. (Like the scene in &ldquo;Sgt. York,&rdquo; where Gary Cooper decides to fight after reading a book of American history on a mountainside during a thunderstorm.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even recent films about some of the most inspiring moments in our past &mdash; &ldquo;Pearl Harbor,&rdquo; D-Day (&ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo;) and &ldquo;The Alamo&rdquo; &mdash; are cleansed of patriotism &mdash; no talk of freedom, democracy, representative government or love of homeland is allowed. (The sole exception is Mel Gibson&rsquo;s 1999 movie &ldquo;The Patriot,&rdquo; which was unabashedly pro-American.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				John Wayne&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Alamo,&rdquo; which suffered from its own flaws (namely that it was a standard-issue John-Wayne Western that happened to be set in the Texas war for independence), at least tried to say something from the heart. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The critics savaged it, in part because they loathed Wayne&rsquo;s anti-Communism, notably manifested in his support for the House Un-American Activities Committee and his refusal to shed tears for the Stalinist Hollywood Ten. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wayne, who was president of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in the late '40s (a group started by Hollywood conservatives like Ward Bond and &mdash; ahem! &mdash; Walt Disney), never did penance for his supposed transgressions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I never felt I needed to apologize for my patriotism,&rdquo; Wayne confessed. &ldquo;I felt that if there were Communists in the business (show business) &mdash; and I knew there were &mdash; then they ought to go over to Russia and try enjoying freedom there.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mention of The Duke, or memories of his films, still provoke snickers from the establishment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In his New York Times review of the new &ldquo;Alamo,&rdquo; Elvis Mitchell can&rsquo;t resist getting in a dig at Wayne&rsquo;s &ldquo;hilariously simple-minded 1960 &lsquo;Alamo&rsquo; which he directed and in which he seems to be looking for Khrushchev.&rdquo; Oh, haw, haw. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In an interview for his book, John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth, Michael Munn asked Wayne if his Alamo movie was a vehicle for his anti-Communism. The actor replied: &ldquo;It was, in part. But it was more than that. I hoped to convey to people all over the free world that they owed a debt to all men who gave their lives fighting for freedom&hellip; I was always inspired by the story because I don&rsquo;t know of any other moment in American history which portrays the courage of men any better.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the movie he also produced and starred in, Wayne made the connection between the heroism of the Alamo&rsquo;s defenders and Americanism, with dialogue &mdash; delivered by The Duke, naturally &mdash; about the eternal fight for freedom and the meaning of a republic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, as noted earlier, what could have been a fine film got bogged down in nonsense &mdash; comic brawls, unlikely forays outside the Alamo&rsquo;s walls and buddy-movie humor. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The new &ldquo;Alamo&rdquo; also has its share of silliness &mdash; with Crockett/Thornton shooting an epaulet off Santa Anna&rsquo;s shoulder and serenading the besieging Mexican army with his fiddle from the Alamo&rsquo;s battlements. All that was missing was Billy Bob delivering karate kicks, a la Jackie Chan, in the climactic battle scene. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The most interesting element in the new film is Mexican actor Emilio Echevarria&rsquo;s portrayal of the self-styled Napoleon of the West, Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, as a strutting sadist &mdash; Juan Peron meets Saddam Hussein. Pity Hollywood can&rsquo;t portray good as aptly as it delineates evil. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Like most Hollywood epics of today, &ldquo;The Alamo&rdquo; is all show and no substance. In its dogged determination to deliver no message (other than fashionable political correctness), the entertainment industry once again offers a spectacle that fails to inspire. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As I left the theater after enduring two hours and seventeen minutes of this, I couldn&rsquo;t help but reflect on the Americans who died in Iraq that very day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In vain, some would say. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time, some thought the same of the deaths in San Antonio. At San Jacinto, Sam Houston proved them wrong, when he overwhelmed the remnants of Santa Anna&rsquo;s army in 18 minutes (due in no small measure to the time bought for him by the Alamo&rsquo;s defenders). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Monday morning quarterbacking is always easier than fighting for your country. Making a movie full of sound and fury is easier than explaining why it all matters.
