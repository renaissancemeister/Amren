				Support Wanes for Initiative

				GOP refuses funds to Save Our State 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Stephen Wall, sbsun.com (CA), Apr. 11</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Less than a week before their self-imposed deadline, backers of an initiative that would deny state services and driver&rsquo;s licenses to undocumented immigrants have failed to drum up enough support for their effort. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The California Republican Party has refused to put its money behind the Save Our State initiative, a proposed measure similar to Proposition 187, which was approved by voters in 1994 but thrown out by courts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re losing sleep over this,&rsquo; said Andy Ramirez, spokesman for Orange County-based Save Our State. &ldquo;There are a lot of people losing sleep over this.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ramirez refused to concede defeat. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It may be a bit more difficult and challenging process,&rsquo; Ramirez said, &ldquo;but it can still happen.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Proponents have collected 405,000 signatures, about half the number they were hoping to receive by their Thursday deadline. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To qualify the measure, the group needs 598,105 verified signatures by April 29. But, as is the case with most initiative campaigns, supporters need about 200,000 extra signatures because many turn out to be invalid. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lack of support for the effort headed by Tustin accountant Ron Prince is in sharp contrast to what happened a decade ago with Proposition 187, which prohibited public services such as education and health care to undocumented immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At that time, the Republican Party pumped $300,000 into a petition drive to qualify the measure. Former Gov. Pete Wilson championed Proposition 187. Ads showing scores of undocumented migrants running across the Mexican border into California were shown with a narrator intoning, &ldquo;They keep coming.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				While Proposition 187 passed with 59percent of the vote, it ended up costing Republicans in future statewide elections. Thousands of immigrants became naturalized citizens and helped Democrats gain control of both houses of the state Legislature and the governor&rsquo;s mansion from 1998 until last year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The campaign on 187 wasn&rsquo;t totally perfect,&rsquo; said Mike Spence, president of the California Republican Assembly, a group that is helping Save Our State collect signatures. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t draw enough distinctions between legal and illegal immigration. As a result, it looked a bit mean-spirited.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fearing another backlash, the party has been silent on the new proposal, which bars undocumented immigrants from receiving welfare and non-emergency health care. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, illegal immigrants are already prohibited from getting welfare and most health benefits under federal legislation passed in 1996. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike Proposition 187, the new proposal doesn&rsquo;t deny public education to students who are in California illegally. Courts struck down the education provision of 187 as unconstitutional under federal law. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Save Our State initiative requires public employees, except teachers and emergency medical providers, to report immigration law violations or face misdemeanor criminal charges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The measure also prohibits official acceptance of identification cards issued by foreign governments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ramirez said the campaign has received about $50,000, much of it in small donations made on the group&rsquo;s Web site, <a href="http://www.save187.com/">www.save187.com</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, put up nearly $2 million toward the recall of former Gov. Gray Davis last year, Save Our State doesn&rsquo;t have money to pay signature gatherers or buy ads on radio and television. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not looking for somebody popping in a million bucks for signatures at the last second,&rsquo; Ramirez said. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t going to happen.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				California Republican Party spokeswoman Karen Hanretty said the proposed initiative isn&rsquo;t a priority for the party. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is not where the state party is going to spend its financial resources,&rsquo; Hanretty said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our resources are being spent to register voters so we can win elections in November. If there is overwhelming support for Save Our State, I&rsquo;m sure Ron Prince will have no problem getting the requisite signatures.&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Political analysts say Republican Party leaders are reluctant to offend Latino voters who President Bush is trying to woo for his re-election. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They got burned with Wilson,&rsquo; said Mike LeMay, a political science professor at Cal State San Bernardino. &ldquo;It bit them in the butt for the last decade. They don&rsquo;t want to do things to revive that backlash.&rsquo;
