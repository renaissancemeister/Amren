			<h1>
				Barrett Was Duped, Deputy Argues
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Jones says he never thought sheriff wasn&rsquo;t going to &lsquo;get the money back&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Steve Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Apr. 18 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett&rsquo;s top deputy said Sunday his office was &ldquo;duped&rdquo; out of a $2 million investment in part because he never dreamed a Florida group would dare con a law enforcement agency. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Chief Deputy Caudell Jones said he and the sheriff believed that Florida investment broker Byron Rainner was placing the money with MetLife, a reputable insurance company that Rainner represented. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I knew these guys aren&rsquo;t going to mess with law enforcement money &mdash; nobody is that crazy,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;It never dawned on me that we weren&rsquo;t going to get that money back.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Barrett, who will not comment on the advice of her lawyer, has maintained that she was duped. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones is scheduled to meet today with federal prosecutors and agents investigating the investment deals. He said he is willing to testify before a grand jury without a grant of immunity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The sheriff originally wrote a $2 million check in March 2003 to MetLife, but scrapped it and wrote a new one to Provident Capital Investments Inc. in Hollywood, Fla., at the direction of Rainner, Jones said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jones said he only co-signed the check at Barrett&rsquo;s direction, but he insisted he thought the company was part of MetLife because Rainner had given a PowerPoint presentation to the sheriff on MetLife investments and brought another MetLife representative to a meeting with Barrett. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The sheriff wrote a $5.2 million check to MetLife in April 2003. The county auditor has deemed both investments illegal under laws governing public funds. MetLife has returned the money at the sheriff&rsquo;s insistence, but Provident Capital has said it lost the $2 million in risky loans to start-up businesses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The money came from funds in which the sheriff collected deposits from such sources as sales of property to satisfy back taxes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				About $925,000 of that money went to pharmaceutical businessman Lancelot James, who often traveled with Rainner to meet with Barrett in Atlanta, Jones said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				James wanted a contract to supply pharmaceuticals to the Fulton County Jail but was unsuccessful, Jones said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ed Marger, one of Jones&rsquo; lawyers, questioned why the sheriff had his client co-sign the check to Provident Capital but didn&rsquo;t insist he co-sign the larger check to MetLife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The lawyer said the transactions look suspicious, but he suggested that Barrett and Jones were fooled because they were not too savvy about investments.
