				<a href="http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595056417,00.html">Cannon&rsquo;s Bill Has Utah County in Uproar</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Frank Pignanelli, deseretnews.com, Apr. 18</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Utah County has a humorous reputation for a unique flavor of politics and other idiosyncrasies. But recent election activities in the 3rd Congressional District have cast a not so comical, malicious blemish on &ldquo;Happy Valley.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Congressman <b>Chris Cannon</b> is a true soldier for the GOP. Various right-wing organizations rate him as one of the most conservative House members, and his lifetime assessment by the American Conservative Union is 96 percent (highest in the Utah delegation). Yet, some constituents are attacking the lawmaker for actions that apparently smell liberal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cannon recently introduced legislation that would provide permits for undocumented workers (&ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo;) to work legally in various agricultural operations. This proposal has bipartisan support from<b> President Bush, Sen. Edward Kennedy</b>, business and farm associations and labor unions. Note: 75 percent of the farm workers in this country do not have proper documentation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the recent legislative session, former Rep. <b>Matt Throckmorton</b> and his anti-immigration buddies lobbied for state restrictions against illegal immigrants and their children &mdash; prohibiting driver&rsquo;s licenses and resident college tuition. Throckmorton has filed as a Republican challenger to Cannon, employing the emotional appeal of &ldquo;immigration reform.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Utah County anti-immigration extremists are receiving assistance from militant out-of-state organizations that are targeting various members of Congress for cosponsoring Cannon&rsquo;s legislation. These groups are funding television commercials in other states that are reminiscent of &ldquo;be scared of people with darker skin&rdquo; advertisements that plagued prior elections &mdash; i.e. the Willie Horton ads in the 1988 presidential race and Sen. Jesse Helms in his final campaign implying African-Americans were stealing jobs from white folks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These bizarre entities have entered Utah County in a big way. They are behind vicious radio commercials that paint even legal newcomers as parasites to Utah taxpayers, blaming them for overcrowded classrooms and water shortages. The strategy is to disparage the Cannon bill and characterize immigrants as a threatening horde. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I am the grandson and great-grandson of immigrants to this country. I cannot say with certainty that all of my ancestors entered legally, but they worked hard and contributed to the nation and this community. The United States is a superpower and will continue to be so, because of the determination and entrepreneurial spirit of people with different skin hues and diverse cultural backgrounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Allowing individuals from other countries to work in our economy, mostly in jobs that Americans don&rsquo;t want, makes sense (food at the local supermarket is cheaper because of their sweat). This issue is above liberal or conservative labels. It is a matter of human dignity combined with practical capitalism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Utahns across the political spectrum are crossing fingers that even Utah County conservatives have limits and repudiate the twisted philosophy of anti-immigration fanatics.
