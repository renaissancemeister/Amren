				Dear Immigration Reformer: 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outfitted with letters of passage to replace the latest in a long string of &ldquo;lost&rdquo; passports, Maha Elsamnah and her paralyzed Jihadi son breezed into Pearson Airport on Good Friday. On that day, the natural malice of Canada Customs settled instead on a returning snowbird: Walking on canes, a frail 92-year-old woman was strip-searched by Canada&rsquo;s gatekeepers. (See Toronto Sun, April 16, 2004 story below.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture? Not a thing, by Liberal Party &ldquo;standards.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the print edition of the Globe and Mail article below, Maha Elsamnah stares out at you with her veil, looking like an unfortunate escapee from Mel Gibson&rsquo;s latest movie. Whew, it was a close one, but defying a growing chorus of Canadians, the Liberal Government has no plans to consider revoking this West-hating, medicare munching Islamic fanatic&rsquo;s Canadian citisenship and entitlement status. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of what we are and I&rsquo;m proud we&rsquo;re in Canada now,&rdquo; says this veiled wonder who considers Canada evil and corrupt, but good enough to provide her parasite son medicare in perpetuity. She&rsquo;s clearly not wearing the veil for shame to hide her hypocrisy of hating us yet feasting off our largesse. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She&rsquo;s lucky, she&rsquo;s not a German or Ukrainian, 80 or 90 years old, who fought on the losing side in World War II. Ottawa, ever sensitive to the politics of ethnic vengeance, would quickly find a way to try to strip the feeble old person of his citizenship. We&rsquo;d like to know just what Maha in the veil said on her citizenship application. Was she entirely frank? If not, why not strip her of her citizenship and rid ourselves of these Canada-hating parasites.

				Khadr&rsquo;s Citizenship Safe, PM Says 
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Despite past ties to bin Laden, family has same rights as others, Martin says 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Kim Lunman and Colin Freeze, Globe and Mail, Apr. 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				OTTAWA and TORONTO &mdash; The Khadrs can call Canada home despite their past ties to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, Prime Minister Paul Martin said yesterday, after days of public demands for his government to strip the Toronto family of their citizenship. Mr. Martin told reporters in Halifax that the Khadrs enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other Canadian citizens. Maha Elsamnah, widow of al-Qaeda supporter Ahmed Khadr, returned to Canada last Friday from Pakistan along with her 15-year-old son Abdul Karim, who was injured last year in a gun battle with U.S. forces. Another son, Abdurahman, returned to Canada last fall after being released from U.S. custody in Afghanistan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When you break the law or obviously threaten the nation, then there are means to dealing with that and obviously [the government] would exercise those means &mdash; but fundamentally, there are rights of citizenship,&rdquo; Mr. Martin said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The family applied for public health insurance in Ontario this week, even as an on-line petition circulated demanding that they be stripped of their citizenship. In an interview, Ms. Elsamnah said she has picked up health-care forms for Karim, who remains in a wheelchair after suffering a bullet wound to his spine, kidneys and spleen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just been to the [Ontario Health Insurance Plan] office. That&rsquo;s it. They said we have to fill out forms,&rdquo; Ms. Elsamnah said, adding that her son was not a fighter in the battle and was unarmed when shot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The family has no prognosis for Karim&rsquo;s chances of walking again. Ms. Elsamnah said her son will have trouble waiting out the three-month residency term required to qualify for publicly funded health care. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ontario Health Minister George Smitherman confirmed yesterday that the family will be entitled to publicly funded health care as long as Ottawa allows them to stay. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my decision to make,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The law is well established here. The Canadian government determines eligibility for Canadian citizenship and the [Ontario] Health Insurance Act, regulation 552, determines further eligibility.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ms. Elsamnah, of Palestinian heritage, came to Canada in the mid-1970s. Her six children are all Canadian citizens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of what we are and I&rsquo;m proud we&rsquo;re in Canada now,&rdquo; she said yesterday, although she has been critical of Canadian social values in the past. &ldquo;Believe me, I will not force myself on anyone as a Canadian citizen. . . . I&rsquo;m demanding for my kids? Is that wrong? Is that a crime?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The RCMP would not say yesterday whether the family is being investigated under the anti-terrorism act introduced following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say yes or no,&rdquo; said Sergeant Gilles Deziel, citing the Privacy Act. &ldquo;We never confirm there&rsquo;s an ongoing investigation.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Conservative MP Stockwell Day was among those calling for a closer examination of the family&rsquo;s background. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Our entire anti-terrorism legislation is now seen as a joke,&rdquo; Mr. Day said. &ldquo;They have triumphantly admitted to breaking anti-terrorism laws. They should not have been allowed into Canada. At the very least, they should be brought in for questioning.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Canada has revoked citizenship for about 50 people since 1977, including six war criminals from the Second World War era.

				Oh Those Khadrs, They&rsquo;ve Taken Chutzpah to New Heights  
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Margaret Wente, Globe and Mail, Apr. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				What would we do without those wacky, lovable Khadrs? Start with dad, friend of the poor, doer of countless good works, who died tragically as a martyr for Islam. I see him as a kind of Jimmy Stewart type. Then there&rsquo;s mom, worried sick about her stricken youngest son, Abdul Karim. He was just trying to earn his Junior Jihad badge when somebody shot back. What&rsquo;s a mother to do? Health care in Pakistan is not always the greatest. But Canada could turn him into a raging homosexual! She chose Canada. There&rsquo;s no substitute for medicare. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Then there&rsquo;s that idealistic daughter, Zaynab, who says it&rsquo;s good to die by blowing other people up. She&rsquo;s the kind of person who sees a good side to everyone. She says Osama has been misunderstood. He&rsquo;s really a kind, devoted family man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All kids get into scrapes now and then, and the Khadr kids are no different. One kid is in Gitmo. One got in trouble when he was suspected of blowing up some Canadians in Afghanistan, but fortunately the bomber&rsquo;s severed head belonged to someone else. Mom&rsquo;s real worry is the second-eldest son, Abdurahman. He&rsquo;s the black sheep in the family. He was kicked out of al-Qaeda training camp. He&rsquo;s not interested in jihad. He sneaks beer and cigarettes. The next thing you know, he&rsquo;ll be into drugs and hanging out with homosexuals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Who would not be filled with admiration for Mrs. Khadr, Maha Elsamnah? She has redefined the meaning of chutzpah. She knows that having a Canadian passport (even though you&rsquo;ve managed to mislay it how many times?) means never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry. It means asking not what you can do for your country, but what your country can do for you. It means demanding free airfare so that your whole family can fly back to Canada to get free medicine, free schooling and free welfare, plus maybe some subsidized housing and free counselling for post-traumatic stress. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But Canadians are no pushovers. She didn&rsquo;t get the airfare. And the family&rsquo;s brand-new passports are only temporary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Khadrs are people who know how to make their government work for them. When dad was detained in Pakistan after some unfortunate misunderstanding, Jean Chr&eacute;tien himself personally intervened to get him back. William Sampson can&rsquo;t say that. Nor can any of the other 3,000 Canadians stuck in foreign jails. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meantime, granny is suing the Canadian government on behalf of Omar, the kid who&rsquo;s stuck in Guantanamo. We all know how awful that place is. Some Afghan kids who were recently released recounted horror stories about how they were forced to play soccer, eat good food, and learn how to read and write. The lawyers say Omar&rsquo;s Charter rights were violated, and they want $100,000. Maybe legal aid will pay their retainer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Khadrs know Canadians are nice. We believe that everyone is welcome here, and that everyone has a right to his or her own opinions. Even terrorists. We&rsquo;ve welcomed Tamil Tigers, a guy who tried to hijack an airplane in Athens, a guy who trained the folks who bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, a guy who tried to blow up the Los Angeles airport, and a guy who was connected to the bombing of the Western housing complex in Riyadh. So the Khadrs will really feel as if they&rsquo;re coming home. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Except for the black sheep. Abdurahman&rsquo;s grandma kicked him out of the house after he ratted out the family on the CBC. God knows, they did their best with him. His father even got a radical cleric to sit down with him to persuade him to become a suicide bomber. They told him he could be the pride of the family. But the kid just wouldn&rsquo;t listen. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe in blowing myself up and killing innocent people,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The leader of the Khadrs&rsquo; mosque in Scarborough says he doesn&rsquo;t know whether or not to take the family back. But according to Abdurahman, it&rsquo;s already too late. Some of his former friends are mad at him for going on TV and causing Muslims such humiliation. Others just tell him he will burn in hellfire for selling out. &ldquo;For them, America is the enemy, and Muslims are victims,&rdquo; he wrote in this newspaper a few weeks ago. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kids. No matter what you do, sometimes they just break a mother&rsquo;s heart.

				92-Year-Old Woman Strip-Searched At Airport Advertisement 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Canadian Press, azcentral.com, Apr. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				THE GRANDSON of a 92-year-old woman says she was strip-searched at Pearson airport after returning from a winter in Florida on the same day a family with alleged terrorist links was allowed back into Canada with the federal government&rsquo;s help. &ldquo;I was infuriated, I was absolutely infuriated,&rdquo; Marty Kann said yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What infuriated me even more was this admitted terrorist family (the Khadrs) coming back into this country, and there are (customs officials) nailing this 92-year-old woman walking into the airport with canes.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kann, a plumber in Pickering, said he learned about his grandmother&rsquo;s Good Friday ordeal while he was at his father-in-law&rsquo;s house for Easter Sunday dinner. 
			</p>
			<p>
				DISTRAUGHT 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said his grandparents are so distraught over their experience, they refuse to discuss it in detail. However, he knows this much: His grandmother, who uses two canes to walk, and his grandfather, who was outfitted with a prosthetic leg after suffering an injury while fighting in the Korean War, were returning to Toronto after spending the winter in Florida. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While going through customs, authorities decided to do a thorough search of his grandmother, Kann said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have no idea what the whole-case scenario is &mdash; all my grandfather told me was they strip-searched her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous. You have to understand she can&rsquo;t even walk without her two canes, or a walker or a scooter. 
			</p>
			<p>
				WANTS APOLOGY 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they would do this to this woman, or any woman in the same physical capacity or obvious physical impairment that she has,&rdquo; said Kann, adding he wants airport or government officials to apologize to his grandparents. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like she had a gun hidden in her canes.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokesman with Canada Border Services Agency said she couldn&rsquo;t discuss specifics of any case. However, &ldquo;personal strip searches aren&rsquo;t something we take lightly,&rdquo; said Patrizia Giolti, who&rsquo;s with the government agency&rsquo;s Greater Toronto Area division. &ldquo;We do follow strict procedures and we would discuss that with our manager before we proceed.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kann&rsquo;s grandparents landed at Pearson the same day Maha Elsamnah, the widow of Ahmed Said Khadr, an admitted al-Qaida financier and confidant of Osama bin Laden, returned to Canada with her paralyzed 14-year-old son, Karim. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ottawa helped arrange emergency passports for Elsamnah and her teenaged son so he could try to get medical help. Karim was injured when his father was killed in a shootout at a house in Waziristan near the border with Afghanistan. (Toronto Sun April 16 2004)

				<b>Family Steeped in al-Qaida Hatred Right under Canada&rsquo;s Nose</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Daniel Pipes, Chicago Sun Times, Mar. 17</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;We are an al-Qaida family.&rdquo; So spoke one of the Khadrs, a Muslim Canadian household whose near-singleminded devotion to Osama bin Laden contains important lessons for the West. Their saga began in 1975, when Ahmad Said al-Khadr left his native Egypt for Canada and soon after married a local Palestinian woman. He studied computer engineering at the University of Ottawa and engaged in research for a major telecommunications firm. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Khadr went to work for Human Concern International, an Ottawa-based charity founded in 1980 with the purported aim to &rdquo;alleviate human suffering,&rdquo; but with a record of promoting militant Islam. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1985, in the course of working in Afghanistan, Khadr met bin Laden and became his close associate. Sometimes Khadr was described as the highest ranking of al-Qaida&rsquo;s 75 Canadian operatives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The federal Canadian government, living up to its naive reputation, contributed $325,000 to Human Concern International During 1988-97 in particular, HCI was simultaneously receiving Canadian taxpayer funding and working with al-Qaida. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The bureaucratic ingenues in Ottawa continued to find nothing wrong with Khadr even after his arrest by Pakistani authorities in 1995 for siphoning off HCI funds to pay for an al-Qaida terrorist operation that year &mdash; an attack on the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan that killed 18. Quite the contrary, Canada&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jean Chretien took advantage of a state visit to Pakistan to intercede with his Pakistani counterpart on Khadr&rsquo;s behalf. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This highly unusual step succeeded; Khadr was released and returned to Canada. In 1996, he and his wife set up an Islamic charity &rdquo;Health and Education Project International.&rdquo; When the Taliban took control in Afghanistan a few months later, the parents and their six children decamped to there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As he worked closely with bin Laden, Khadr became known for his militant Islamic vitriol, leading one Frenchman in Afghanistan to observe about him, &rdquo;I never met such hostility, someone so against the West.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Like other al-Qaida leaders, Khadr disappeared from view soon after 9/11. He spent two years on the lam, reappearing only in October 2003, when Pakistani forces unexpectedly found that the DNA of one unrecognizable corpse from a bloody shoot-out matched Khadr&rsquo;s. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The terrorism-related activities of other Khadr family members &mdash; wife, one of two daughters, three of four sons &mdash; complement their patriarch&rsquo;s record. 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Wife Maha Elsamnah took her then-14-year-old son Omar from Canada to Pakistan in 2001 and enrolled him for al-Qaida training. 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Daughter Zaynab, 23, was engaged to one terrorist and married, with Osama bin Laden himself at the nuptials, an al-Qaida member in 1999. Zaynab endorses the 9/11 atrocities and hopes her infant daughter will die fighting Americans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Son Abdullah, 22, is an al &mdash; Qaida fugitive constantly on the move to elude capture. Canadian intelligence states that he ran an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan during the Taliban period, something Abdullah denies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Son Omar, 17, stands accused of hurling a grenade in July 2002, killing a U.S. medic in Afghanistan. Omar lost sight in one eye in the fighting and is now a U.S. detainee in Guantanamo. 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Son Abdul Karim, 14, half-paralyzed in the October 2003 shoot-out that left his father dead, is a prisoner in a Pakistani hospital. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fortunately, there is also one positive story: 
			</p>
			<p>
				*Son Abdurahman, 21, reluctantly trained with al-Qaida, was captured by coalition forces in November 2001 and agreed to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in Kabul, Guantanamo and Bosnia. He returned to Canada in October 2003, where he denounced both extremism (&rdquo;I want to be a good, strong, civilized, peaceful Muslim&rdquo;) and his family&rsquo;s terroristic ways. 
			</p>
			<p>
				While an unusual case, the Khadrs&rsquo; horrifying history serves as a warning, pointing to the danger of Muslim parents in North America and Europe who stray so deeply into militant Islamic currents that, Palestinian-style, they seek to turn their children into militant Islamic weapons to be turned against their own countries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This pattern is yet rare, but it might well become more widespread as the second generation of Islamist children in the West come of age. The key in the Khadr case, as it will likely be for others, is isolation within a militant Islamic environment &mdash; schools, media, social life. Preventing such self-segregation must be an urgent policy goal throughout the West.
