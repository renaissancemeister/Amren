			<h1>
				Woman got Boot for Speaking Truth about Black-White Dating
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Gregory Kane, BlackAmericaWeb, Apr. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				You have to give it to Raqiyah Mays for daring to go where few go these days. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mays is a former DJ for radio station WWPR in New York City. She was fired in March after being afflicted with an attack of honesty. During a show in which listeners were called on to make personal confessions, Mays made one of her own. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My confession this hour is that I&rsquo;m a racist,&rdquo; Mays said according to several news reports. &ldquo;I really am. I have a problem with white people. Not all white people, but a lot of white people. I can&rsquo;t tell if they are being real with me or not. And then I hate when the black guy is walking down the street with the white girl. I hate both of them. C&rsquo;mon, there&rsquo;s a man shortage.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those words got Mays the boot. She has since been hired by WQHT, a rival station of WWPR. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Two weeks ago Mays went on Fox News Channel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hannity &amp; Colmes&rdquo; show, where these two white guys presumed they were able to feel the sistah on her views about interracial dating. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Newsflash, Messrs. Hannity &amp; Colmes. You can&rsquo;t feel Mays, or any other black woman, on this one. Your race and gender preclude that. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Taken in its entire context, Mays was clearly talking about a situation where black men &mdash; already in short supply for black women looking for husbands or boyfriends &mdash; snub eligible black women to chase after white women. What would either Hannity or Colmes know about that? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Trust me, I know what Mays is talking about. I saw her on &ldquo;Hannity &amp; Colmes,&rdquo; and the sistah is as fine as they come. She&rsquo;s probably tired of seeing black men not just with white women, but ugly, chubby white women at that. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah, I said it. And I&rsquo;m not sorry, because what we&rsquo;re talking about here is rejection. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Most guys, whether they want to admit it or not, know all about rejection. And we all know that it&rsquo;s not being rejected by women we desperately want that hurts. It&rsquo;s the knuckleheads we get rejected for that makes us bristle. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Black women, especially the drop-dead gorgeous ones like Mays, probably feel the same way when they see a black man with a white woman so ugly they figure the brother is only with her because he lost a bet. Mays had the guts to stand up and say how she felt. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I prefer her honesty to the way Hollywood producers and writers approach the subject of interracial romancing. Have you noticed it? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nine times out of 10, in a television show or movie, the black-white romance is one involving a white man and a black woman. The black man-white woman liaison is shown only rarely, but the Hollywood muckety-mucks figure they&rsquo;re being cutting edge by presenting the &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; subject of interracial romance with a white man/black woman combination. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But as the late Strom Thurmond proved, the white man/black woman romantic liaison has never really been taboo. Oh, it was said to be, but that was with the proverbial wink-wink and nudge-nudge. That&rsquo;s why Halle Berry has done a string of consecutive films in which her love interest was a white man. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Can anybody tell me the last time Berry kissed a black man on-screen? 
			</p>
			<p>
				I thought not. Now suppose Denzel Washington had done a string of movies with a white woman as his romantic lead. He hasn&rsquo;t, and couldn&rsquo;t if he wanted to. Those same Hollywood honchos who are only too happy to promote the white man/black woman romance would see that his career ended pretty darned quick. Black women wouldn&rsquo;t be too happy with him either &mdash; and rightly so. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But brothers aren&rsquo;t supposed to mention what&rsquo;s clearly happening in the case of Berry. We&rsquo;d be considered, at best, poor sports if we did. Mays, who approached the dilemma from the black man/white woman side, was considered less than a poor sport. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If she is, you can probably put perhaps thousands of other black women in that category with her.
