				Some Want to Change UNC Award Named after Alleged White Supremacist
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Cornelia Phillips Spencer Known For Efforts To Reopen University After Civil War 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Scott Mason, wral.com (NC), Apr. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				CHAPEL HILL, N.C. &mdash; Cornelia Phillips Spencer&rsquo;s portrait hangs in Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There is also a dorm named after her and she is buried in the Chapel Hill cemetery, but some people say the university should take a second look at the individual and her accomplishments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Spencer is remembered most for leading the effort to reopen the university after the Civil War. She was a respected leader, who history suggests, had racist views. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Cornelia Phillips Spencer felt that whites should be superior to blacks in the post-Civil War South,&rdquo; said Harry Watson, of the UNC Center for the Study of the American South. 
			</p>
			<p>
				UNC also has the Cornelia Phillips Spencer Bell Award. Every year, it is presented to a woman who has made outstanding contributions to the university. Now, some want the name changed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The woman that the award is named after is a white supremacist, and that should cause people to stop and think and not do business as usual,&rdquo; graduate student Yonni Chapman said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get the university to take its history and look at it honestly and not flinch and deal with it.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				It is not the first time the past has haunted the present. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got Silent Sam, the Confederate statue. You&rsquo;ve got Saunders Hall back here, which is named after the leader of the Ku Klux Klan,&rdquo; Chapman said. &ldquo;I mean the stone walls around the university were built by slaves. Our history is the present.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember it &mdash; to talk about it, but not necessarily to lose our heads over it,&rdquo; Watson said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This fall, the university plans to hold campuswide discussions about its racist history, about Cornelia Phillips Spencer, opting not to bury its past. 
			</p>
			<p>
				UNC Chancellor James Moeser has also commented on the controversy. He said, &ldquo;We cherish the times in our past when this university acted as a force for enlightenment and progress. But the shameful institution of human bondage is part of our past, too.&rdquo;
