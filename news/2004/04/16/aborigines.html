				<i>Rod Mcguirk, AP, Kansas City Star, Apr. 16 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>CANBERRA, Australia &mdash; </b>One of Australia&rsquo;s most respected Aborigine leaders warned the government on Friday that its move to abolish the country&rsquo;s commission on Aborginal affairs could produce a violent backlash. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In a sweeping reform of the government&rsquo;s indigenous policy, Prime Minister John Howard said Thursday he will introduce legislation in Parliament next month to dissolve the 14-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The commission, widely referred to as ATSIC, advises all levels of government on indigenous issues. With 17 commissioners elected by Aboriginal voters and a budget of more than $600 million, it administers government-funded projects aimed at improving their way of life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Created by a Labor government, it has for years been accused of mismanagement, corruption and nepotism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We believe very strongly that the experiment in elected representation for indigenous people has been a failure,&rdquo; Howard said. &ldquo;We will not replace ATSIC with an alternative body.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				In place of ATSIC, the government wants to appoint a panel of Aboriginal experts to advise them on indigenous needs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Aborigines number about 400,000 in Australia, a country of 20 million. The poorest, sickest and least-educated minority group, they receive $1 billion a year in welfare and other payments &mdash; about $4,500 per person. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The board is the top elected body for Aborigines, who were given the vote only in 1967 after they rose up against the government. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Alison Anderson, one of the board&rsquo;s most respected commissioners and its only woman, warned that the loss of an elected indigenous voice would herald a return to those violent days. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Aboriginal people are living in creeks, living without (running) water, they&rsquo;ve been cornered and without a voice, they&rsquo;ll come out in the only way that they know and that&rsquo;s violence,&rdquo; Anderson told The Associated Press. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A few weeks ago, dozens of police were wounded in a clash with hundreds of Aboriginal rioters in a crime-ridden ghetto in Sydney. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Anderson said the commission was paying the ultimate price for campaigning on behalf of Aborigines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s ashamed of the good work ATSIC&rsquo;s done in showing the world how disadvantaged we are and highlighting the racist attitudes of a lot non-indigenous people and governments,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another senior indigenous leader, Pat Dodson, said Howard&rsquo;s conservative government was using the ATSIC as a scapegoat in an election year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many Aborigines live in squalid camps in the Outback or garbage-strewn neighborhoods on the fringes of towns and cities. They suffer health problems such as low birth weight and trachoma that are more commonly associated with developing nations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their life expectancy is about 20 years lower than the rest of Australian society, and substance abuse and domestic violence are rife. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Abolishing ATSIC would help efforts to stamp out such problems, Howard said, adding that his government&rsquo;s goals were to improve Aborigines&rsquo; health and education and employment opportunities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Howard&rsquo;s government has long been critical of how the commission spends its money on what the prime minister dismisses as symbolic issues like fighting for land rights and for squandering funds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the money&rsquo;s been wisely spent,&rdquo; Howard said in a radio interview. &ldquo;I think the culture of favoritism and nepotism that has surrounded that body has become notorious.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dodson likened the advisory panel&rsquo;s role to that of Aboriginal trackers who helped the Europeans colonize Australia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The notion of being an adviser is long gone,&rdquo; Dodson told The Associated Press. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like being a tracker on the trail, showing the boss which way to go and then the boss gets all the glory for blazing the path &mdash; it&rsquo;s a nonsense.&rdquo;
