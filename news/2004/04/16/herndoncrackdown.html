			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>S.A. Miller, Wash. Times, Apr. 16</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Illegal immigration has become a key issue in town elections in Herndon, where some candidates have pledged to stop allowing illegal aliens to receive taxpayer-funded aid and reside in the town&rsquo;s overcrowded group homes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not opposed to having an immigrant population, but I am concerned that our services and our resources are being taken advantage of by people who are not contributing to the community through taxes or a regular job,&rdquo; said Herndon Town Council member Connie H. Hutchinson, a candidate for mayor in the May 4 nonpartisan general election. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We have a history of welcoming people and encouraging diversity,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I think it has probably gone beyond the realm of what we can accommodate.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The immigration issue has been brewing for at least five years in Herndon, a town of 22,000 residents with a burgeoning Hispanic population that exceeded 5,600 &mdash; more than 25 percent &mdash; in the 2000 census. It came to a head last summer over a proposal to build a shelter for day laborers &mdash; a town-sanctioned alternative to the parking lot of the 7-Eleven store in the middle of town, where as many as 100 laborers currently gather every morning to await work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite support by the majority of the council, the proposal died amid public outcry. Then the council authorized day-laborer shelters in the zoning code and made plans for a $1.3 million center for social service programs, most of which apparently do not check recipients&rsquo; immigration status &mdash; moves that galvanized candidates opposed to illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We pay the highest taxes in the state of Virginia, and I don&rsquo;t think we should be funding social programs for illegal aliens,&rdquo; said Ann V. Null, one of the 12 candidates for six seats on the town council. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Null, a 46-year-old homemaker who home-schools her two sons, gained prominence as a community activist fighting the shelter initiative. Now she wants illegal immigrants weeded out of the day-laborer pool, cut off from taxpayer-funded aid and rounded up by the Herndon Police Department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A state law that takes effect July 1 permits police in Herndon and every jurisdiction in Virginia to detain suspected illegal aliens and gang members for up to 72 hours. Mrs. Null and other anti-illegal alien candidates relish the prospect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Entry into our country without permission is a crime, and we should be prosecuting all crimes,&rdquo; Mrs. Null said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Town council member Dennis D. Husch, who along with Miss Hutchinson cast the only votes against zoning for day-laborer shelters, also said he looked forward to a police crackdown on illegal aliens. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Husch, who is running for re-election, said he supports a shelter or hiring center for the day laborers, except he wants the facility operated by the Virginia Employment Commission, which would check the immigration status of prospective workers. 
			</p>
			<p>
				David A. Kirby, a candidate for town council who opposes providing illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded programs or a day-laborer hiring center, said home overcrowding is his pet issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is causing the home values to depreciate, it is upsetting the people of Herndon and it is mostly caused by illegal aliens,&rdquo; said Mr. Kirby, 56, who works as an information technology manager for Raytheon Corporation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the issue was the same whether addressing day laborers, social services or home overcrowding. &ldquo;If I look the other way when we suspect there are illegal aliens among these people, then I would not be upholding my oath of office,&rdquo; Mr. Kirby said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Herndon Mayor Richard C. Thoesen said the anti-illegal alien candidates were exploiting the fear and prejudices of a community in the throes of a demographic transformation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mean-spirited and it is shortsighted,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Are we going to ignore or turn our back on a large segment of the population on the pretense that some of these people are illegal?&rdquo; asked Mr. Thoesen, a longtime political figure in Herndon who is not running for a second term as mayor. &ldquo;It is in the long-term best interest of the community to help these people help themselves.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He said the town&rsquo;s aggressive pursuit of illegal immigrants would risk alienating the Hispanic community. &ldquo;They are trying to raise families and help their children do better, just like I did,&rdquo; said Mr. Thoesen. &ldquo;Are you telling me that 26 percent of our population is illegal? That&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo;
