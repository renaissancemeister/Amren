				Texas A&M Works to Improve Diversity on Campus
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Jeff Brady, WFAA-TV (TX), Apr. 12</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Texas A&M has long been criticized for its lack of racial diversity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lawmakers have threatened to punish the school financially if things don&rsquo;t change, so the school has launched an aggressive outreach to develop diversity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A select group of seniors at Skyline High School received more than $200,000 in scholarship offers to attend A&M. They are minority student-scholars &mdash; most of whom have not yet decided where they will go after graduation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If I had to decide today, I am leaning toward Rice University,&rdquo; said Skyline senior Angel Brown. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Also Online</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If I had to choose today, it would be UT,&rdquo; said senior Jaime Martinez. 
			</p>
			<p>
				All of the seniors at a recent assembly have already been admitted, however, to Texas A&M. The challenge for the second-largest school in Texas is now to get those students to commit to enrolling this fall, at a campus where only about 2.5 percent of the undergraduates are black, and nine percent are Hispanic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That compares to three and ten percent at Texas Tech, three and fourteen percent at UT Austin, and 15 and 20 percent minority enrollments, respectively, at the University of Houston. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s a diversity disadvantage the Aggies are trying to change&hellip; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There are no quotas anywhere, and the question is whether you take race specifically into account in admissions,&rdquo; said Texas A&M President Robert Gates. &ldquo;Frankly, we want to admit kids because of who they are, not what they are.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The A&M effort includes unique welcomes and tours for minority applicants who visit the campus, along with former students speaking to potential new students during Gates&rsquo; high-school visits. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried to make sure that students understand that if they come to Texas A&M, that they find family,&rdquo; said Texas A&M presidential chief of staff Rodney McLendon.
