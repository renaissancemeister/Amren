			<h1>
				Council Member Wastes No Time Reviving MLK Issue
			</h1>
			<p align="center">
				<b>Proving she will make good on her City Council campaign promise, Gina King adds the item to the upcoming agenda</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Molly Moorhead, St. Petersburg Times, Apr. 22</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				ZEPHYRHILLS &mdash; In her first meeting as a City Council member, Gina King will attempt Monday to overturn the renaming of Sixth Avenue after Martin Luther King Jr. 
			</p>
			<p>
				King put the issue on the agenda late Wednesday afternoon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I request time on the agenda &hellip; to recommend that we restore the name of the street and right-of-way currently known as Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue to its original name of Sixth Avenue thus preserving the historic numeric grid system already established within the city,&rdquo; King wrote in an e-mail to the city. 
			</p>
			<p>
				City Council members tipped over a hornet&rsquo;s nest last fall when they renamed the street at the request of a group of mostly black residents, some of whom live outside city limits. The council voted twice, passing the measure 4-1 the first time after numerous people spoke in opposition at the meeting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hundreds of people quickly mobilized, signing petitions to implore the council to abandon the renaming and to recall the members who voted for it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, council member Cathi Compton, after hearing the objections of many residents, brought the issue back hoping to work out a compromise. Her motion failed 3-2. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The issue prompted the formation of a task force to address racial divisions in the city, and it changed the makeup of the council. 
			</p>
			<p>
				King defeated incumbent Lance Smith in last week&rsquo;s election on the platform of the street issue, and veteran member Liz Geiger narrowly won re-election over R.J. Morgan, another foe of the renaming. Both Geiger and Smith consistently supported the renaming. 
			</p>
			<p>
				King said Wednesday that the people who voted for her are expecting her to bring the issue back. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really see the need in waiting to move to have the street name restored,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She was referring specifically to people who live on the street, but said the issue affects all of Zephyrhills. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think all the residents of Zephyrhills were generally disgusted with how the name of the street was changed, regardless of whether or not they live on Sixth Avenue,&rdquo; King said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During her campaign, she said, she heard a lot of the same complaints. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Most of them were angered by the fact that City Hall didn&rsquo;t listen to their own citizens,&rdquo; King said. &ldquo;That seems to be the hot point.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The City Council will meet at 6 p.m. Monday at City Hall, 5335 Eighth St.
