				Authorities Jail Farmworker Infected with Tuberculosis for Disobeying Quarantine Order
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>AP, tbo.com, Apr. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) &mdash; A man health officials believe infected 56 people with tuberculosis was jailed for refusing an order to be quarantined. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Feliciano Morelos, 19, a farmworker from Oaxaca state in Mexico, was being held in a jail cell equipped with special air filters so other inmates do not breathe the same air, according to the District Attorney&rsquo;s office. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tuberculosis, which is deadly if not diagnosed early and treated, is caused by bacteria and transmitted through droplets spread by coughing and sneezing. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Morelos is believed to be the first person jailed in Santa Barbara County for disobeying an isolation order from a public health officer and endangering public safety, officials said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He was really posing a very serious public health risk,&rdquo; said Paige Batson, the county&rsquo;s disease control and prevention manager. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities say Morelos refused on two occasions to remain quarantined. He told the Santa Barbara News-Press for Sunday&rsquo;s editions that he left quarantine at his uncle&rsquo;s urging and did not realize he was not supposed to leave. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand the laws here. I won&rsquo;t escape again,&rdquo; he said. He told the paper he hoped to be moved to a hospital. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Health officials believe he infected 56 people, mostly family members in California and Washington. Nine people have developed an active case of the disease. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A total of 14,871 cases of active TB were reported in the United States last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 2 million people around the world die annually of TB.
