			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>news24.com (SA), Apr. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				San Francisco &mdash; Being white is not grounds for a couple from South Africa to gain asylum in the United States, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed an asylum application from a white couple who claimed they lost the jobs they held under apartheid and fear they won&rsquo;t be able to find work if deported from the United States. The husband also claimed he would be subjected to criminal activity if deported because he is a white. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The unanimous decision came as South Africa prepares for its 10-year anniversary on Tuesday from the fall of a white-ruled government under apartheid. The governing African National Congress scored its biggest election victory on April 14, securing about 70% of the parliamentary vote. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The San Francisco-based appeals court said the couple, Michael and Edith Gormley of Bainbridge Island, Washington, failed to establish they have been or will be persecuted if returned to South Africa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Reverse discrimination</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the Gormleys suffered, at most, what may be perceived as reverse discrimination which resulted in some adverse economic consequences,&rdquo; Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote for the panel. She was joined by Judge William Candby and Ronald Gould. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The couple claimed they lost their long-time jobs &mdash; he was a construction supervisor and she was a government employee &mdash; because of South Africa&rsquo;s Employment Equity Act of 1998, which was designed to ameliorate past discrimination and give jobs to blacks. They said they were denied new employment because of their race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The couple legally entered the United States in 1999 as visitors and sought asylum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Three men stole cellphone</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The husband said he feared being victimised by criminals if returned. He said three black men stole his cellphone in 1998 and later six black men wielding knives stole his watch and phone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The appeals court said such criminal activity does not rise to the level of persecution and the granting of asylum. &ldquo;Robberies of this sort are an all too common by-product of civil unrest and economic turmoil,&rdquo; Wardlaw wrote. The judge added that the husband was unable to prove to US immigration officials that he was criminally victimised on account of his race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The couple work at a local market packing groceries and were not immediately available for comment. A community fund-raising effort for the couple generated at least $13 000 for legal expenses.
