				Va. Seeks New Role against Illegals
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Police to Enforce Immigration Law 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Mary Beth Sheridan, Wash. Post, Apr. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The federal government will soon grant a group of Virginia State Police officers the power to enforce immigration law, making the state the third in the country to adopt the practice since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, local officials said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The tentative agreement between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Virginia State Police, permissible under a 1996 law, is part of a movement across the country to grant local law enforcement officials more authority to detain illegal immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Proponents say the expanded powers will give police more tools to combat terrorism, gang violence and other crimes. But immigrant advocates counter that the practice could lead to ethnic profiling. And some police officials, including D.C. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey, are openly opposed to the idea and say it could discourage immigrants from reporting crimes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The debate illustrates the complexity of improving security in a country that is home to an estimated 8 million or more illegal immigrants. Three of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks were part of that underground population, but so are millions of workers and families in communities across America. Homeland Security, which enforces immigration laws, acknowledges that it does not have enough agents to track down all those undocumented immigrants.
