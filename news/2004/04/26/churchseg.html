				Racial Divide Still Strong in Religion
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				But some say situation is just a result of choice 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Peter Smith, The Courier-Journal (Louisville, KY), Apr. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Sunday mornings, the mostly black congregation of Forest Missionary Baptist gathers at its Newburg church, while the mostly white congregation of Highland Baptist worships at its Cherokee Triangle sanctuary. The racial pattern repeats itself in many churches throughout Louisville and the nation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At first glance, churches seem to have changed little since the 1950s, when the Rev. Martin Luther King lamented that &ldquo;the most segregated hour of Christian America is 11 o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, virtually no church practices official segregation, and most preach racial diversity, yet the vast majority of American congregations consist overwhelmingly of one racial or ethnic group, religion experts say. In nearly 95 percent of American churches, one racial or ethnic group makes up more than four-fifths of the congregation, according to a study by Rice University sociologist Michael Emerson. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In one sense, the persistence of &ldquo;the most segregated hour&rdquo; reflects the racial differences that remain in American culture 50 years after the U.S. Supreme Court began tearing down legalized discrimination with its Brown v. Board of Education decision. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Brown decision on May 17, 1954, said that separate public schools for blacks were &ldquo;inherently unequal.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the situation with churches is different, several scholars and ministers said in interviews. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many blacks have long viewed their churches as bastions of strength. In fact, many black churches were founded by African Americans who refused to accept such insults as being forced to use separate pews, communion cups and even baptismal waters from whites in white-run churches. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People who grew up in the Brown or post-Brown era have trouble understanding that &lsquo;separate&rsquo; is in some ways an act of freedom for black ministers and black congregations,&rdquo; said David Chappell, a University of Arkansas professor and author of the new book, &ldquo;A Stone of Hope: Prophetic Religion and the Death of Jim Crow.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many African Americans feel that other than their own families, &ldquo;the only institution left for the black community is the black church,&rdquo; added the Rev. T. Vaughn Walker, professor of black church studies at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an issue of power, to be very honest,&rdquo; Walker said. &ldquo;If that was lost somewhere in the blending of congregations, the African-American community is concerned that last, viable, free voice would be lost.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				People usually find congregations of their own race because they prefer a worship style and cultural setting they are familiar with, added the Rev. John Crittenden Jr., pastor of Forest Missionary Baptist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;From my perspective, segregation is something you are made to do, you didn&rsquo;t have a choice in it,&rdquo; said Crittenden, who speaks from experience, having grown up in the last years of school segregation. &ldquo;I personally disagree that 11 o&rsquo;clock is the most segregated hour. It&rsquo;s not a mandatory thing, it&rsquo;s a choice thing.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Among Catholics, some African Americans join mixed or mostly white congregations, while others prefer the black traditions of music, liturgy and social activism in historically black parishes, said M. Annette Turner, executive director of the Office of Multicultural Ministry for the Archdiocese of Louisville. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said that unlike past eras when parishes were segregated, members now have a choice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is always good to worship one God together,&rdquo; Turner said. &ldquo;I also realize that there&rsquo;s a tremendous need to affirm the diversity that God has created. What would be a real attribute to this community is for people to recognize that diversity is good and that it really is OK for our Vietnamese to have a Vietnamese Mass and not feel threatened by that, or to have African-American Catholic churches and understand it&rsquo;s not an act of separation.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Partnerships thrive </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rather than push for a merger of their churches, black and white congregations are increasingly forming partnerships for social outreach, pulpit exchanges and other activities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Crittenden&rsquo;s church, for example, recently began holding prayer vigils with members of the Highland church. They gather at homicide scenes throughout the city, praying with victims&rsquo; families and neighbors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Highland&rsquo;s pastor, the Rev. Joe Phelps, said the partnership has brought his church a new awareness of both the struggles and the spiritual traditions of black churches. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Unlike the public schools, where that&rsquo;s something we all hold in common, the black churches are bases of positive power in the black community,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Those of us who care about the black church are hesitant to risk compromising the black church by advocating a sort of blended or multicultural church.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Such partnerships are becoming increasingly common. Some black churches are affiliating with the mostly white Southern Baptist Convention. The mostly white St. Matthews Baptist Church last year became the first to join the General Association of Baptists in Kentucky, a black Baptist association. Southeast Christian Church, Kentucky&rsquo;s largest congregation, has provided grants and volunteer workers to smaller black and white churches. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>A long history </b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Racial separation in American churches dates at least to the late 18th century, when African-American Methodists in New York and Philadelphia broke with their white counterparts who were treating them as second-class citizens &mdash; for example, forbidding black ministers from preaching to racially mixed congregations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the South, white Christians would bring their slaves to church &mdash; sometimes out of concern for their souls, but often to make sure blacks heard Bible verses commanding slaves to obey their masters, Walker said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;That makes me sad, that those who know Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit can&rsquo;t get the race issue right,&rdquo; Walker said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After the Civil War, as slavery gave way to legalized segregation, black Baptists and Methodists in the South formed separate congregations and denominations. Some white congregations enforced segregation strictly, while others allowed small numbers of black members. Later religious movements, such as Pentecostalism, also split racially. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Catholic churches in the South also kept blacks in separate places in pews, at communion rails and in cemeteries. The Archdiocese of Louisville, for example, created separate black and white parishes in the early 20th century. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The tide began to turn in the 1950s. While civil-rights activists mainly targeted segregated schools, buses and lunch counters, some also staged &ldquo;kneel-ins&rdquo; at whites-only churches. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outreach efforts 
			</p>
			<p>
				In recent years, several historically white denominations &mdash; both liberal and conservative in theology &mdash; have formally repented of racism. Virtually all of them have strategies to reach more blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Just last week, for example, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary appointed a new dean of intercultural studies. The Rev. Ken Fentress, an African American who has pastored black, white and mixed-race churches, will evaluate curriculum and recommend ways to foster diversity. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And black churches also need to be open to people of other races, Crittenden said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I believe black racism is as bad as white racism,&rdquo; said Crittenden, whose church has some white members. &ldquo;I have people here that I have to educate that all white people are not bad.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Few are predicting that racial divisions among denominations will go away soon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it will be overcome in our lifetime, because at least in the American context, church has been equated with family,&rdquo; said Stephen Ray, associate professor of theology and philosophy at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. And family usually involves people who look like each other, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ray dismissed the idea that people go to churches with people of the same race because of residential patterns, noting that many people drive for miles to attend churches and that many &ldquo;churches will face death before they will seriously consider changing&rdquo; to reflect changing demographics in their own neighborhood. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Emerson, the Rice sociologist, said that by staying in one-race churches, people tend not to hear other perspectives on race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And since people often get jobs through social networks such as churches, such racial separation helps reinforce economic inequality, he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His conclusion: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to live according to Christian Scripture, then you need to be in integrated congregations where possible.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some churches are trying. As the American population diversifies in ways that were unforeseen in the 1950s, several churches have been adding services in Spanish and other languages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Calvin Presbyterian Church, for example, has both English and Taiwanese services and will soon play host to a Korean congregation as well, said its pastor, the Rev. Paul Detterman. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Detterman said the partnership has taught white members &ldquo;about the radical nature of the gospel, it teaches what it means to be resident aliens.&rdquo;
