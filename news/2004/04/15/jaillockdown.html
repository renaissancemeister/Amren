			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Mai Tran, L. A. Times, Apr. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prisoners at two Orange County jails have been stripped of their privileges after authorities were informed that violence between Latino and Asian gangs was imminent, officials said Wednesday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As the lockdown imposed April 1 on 3,500 inmates of the Theo Lacy Jail in Orange and the Men&rsquo;s Central Jail in Santa Ana winds down, jail privileges will slowly be restored, said Jon Fleischman, spokesman for the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities had said they received tips that some Latino inmates had placed a &ldquo;green light&rdquo; &mdash; a jailhouse term for ordering an attack &mdash; on Asian inmates in retaliation for a pair of gang attacks in Garden Grove. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One incident may have been the March 19 shooting in the parking lot of Mae&rsquo;s Cafe in the 9000 block of Trask Avenue that wounded three people, authorities said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking into it,&rdquo; said Garden Grove Police Lt. Mike Hamilton, &ldquo;but we have not been able to positively make a connection.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Authorities said that unsettled gang conflicts are sometimes dragged inside county jails, heightening the potential for violence among inmates affiliated with gangs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the lockdown, male inmates &mdash; who are placed in modules according to risk level &mdash; are banned from recreational and educational programs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They are served one hot meal a day in the mess hall, as required by state law, during staggered lunch times to minimize communication, Fleischman said. Two cold sack meals are delivered to their cells. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last Friday, inmates at maximum security Theo Lacy Jail were not permitted visitors.
