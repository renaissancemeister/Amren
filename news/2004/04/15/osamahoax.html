			<h1>
				Girl Recants &lsquo;Osama&rsquo; Part of Attack Story, District Says
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Lona O&rsquo;Connor, Palm Beach Post, Apr. 15</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A 12-year-old Boynton Beach student has recanted a key element of her story about four boys attacking her at school because of her religion, according to a spokesman for the Palm Beach County School District. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But a spokesman for the girl&rsquo;s family says she is sticking by her story that she was targeted because of her distinctive Muslim head scarf. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Council on American-Islamic Relations alleged Monday that four boys at Congress Middle School attacked the girl, a seventh-grader of Pakistani heritage, because she wore a <i>hijab</i>, or head scarf. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A council news release said the boys pulled on her scarf and hair, hit her with a belt in the face and called her &ldquo;Osama.&rdquo; The incident took place on April 5, and a relative asked the council for assistance, according to council spokesman Altaf Ali. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ali said he spoke to the girl and her family on Wednesday and the girl still says the attack focused on her religion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She also told him that she had been confronted similarly before, and that students had called her &ldquo;Osama&rdquo; on several occasions. She said she told a sixth-grade assistant principal, who minimized the significance of the incidents. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But when school board investigators questioned the girl this week, she said nobody called her &ldquo;Osama,&rdquo; a reference to Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, considered responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It appears that somebody embellished the story,&rdquo; said Palm Beach County School District spokesman Nat Harrington. &ldquo;This greatly concerns us. We want to get at the facts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Based on what she told the investigators, this may not have anything to do with her ethnicity or religion. When children have a conflict, it&rsquo;s not necessarily because of nationality.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				On Tuesday, the girl&rsquo;s parents made a formal report to the police officer on campus, Ali said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A spokeswoman for the Boynton Beach Police Department said she was unaware of any such report. The school does not have a full-time officer, but a Boynton police officer works part time there, teaching a course called &ldquo;Aggression, Victims and Bystanders,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Council on American-Islamic Relations suggested that law enforcement officials treat the incident as a hate crime.
