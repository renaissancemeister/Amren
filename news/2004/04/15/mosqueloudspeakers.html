			</h1>

				U.S. Muslims liken loudspeakers on mosques to church bells 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>WorldNetDaily, Apr. 15 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A holy war of sorts is heating up in a Detroit suburb, where members of the local Muslim community want loudspeakers on mosques to announce the Islamic call to prayer five times each day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But the idea is running into opposition from other residents of Hamtramck, Mich., many of whom are Christian, who think the prayer calls as early as 6 a.m. and as late as 10 p.m. would be disruptive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When you call to prayer, you are proselytizing, and as a citizen of the United States I don&rsquo;t want to hear it,&rdquo; Bob Golen, 68, told the Detroit Free Press. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It is not my God. My God is Jesus Christ,&rdquo; Caroline Zarski, 81, said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this noise invading my home at 10 p.m.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Al-Islah Islamic Center asked the city three months ago to alter its noise ordinance to allow the calls to prayer. In February, the council reportedly supported the change but sought a public hearing before making any change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to make it a big deal,&rdquo; said businessman Abdul Algazali, according to the Free Press. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a low-pitched voice. It&rsquo;s not going to wake up anybody.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				City Council President <a href="mailto:kmajewski@hamtramckcity.com">Karen Majewski</a> compared the call to prayer to bells ringing on Christian churches, though other residents were said to disagree at Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Majewski says the loudspeaker measure is likely to pass at next week&rsquo;s meeting, and would subsequently take effect in late May. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Petitions have circulated among mainly white and Christian members of the community for weeks asking the council not to amend the ordinance,&rdquo; said Councilman <a href="mailto:sklein@hamtramckcity.com">Scott Klein</a>. &ldquo;Both sides have issued threats of federal lawsuits based on the constitutionality of the ban or the removal of the ban.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				There are five mosques in Hamtramck, and three others just over the border in Detroit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On its <a href="http://hamtramck.us/">website</a>, the city says it provides &ldquo;A Touch of THE WORLD In America,&rdquo; touting itself as &ldquo;the home of the most varied ethnic mix of people and customs from around the world.&rdquo;
