			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				A few hundred undocumented immigrants are living in crude shanties to avoid paying rent or resorting to city shelters 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Jonathan Schienberg, Newsday.com (NY), Apr. 14</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tucked among tall ferns, twisted tree branches and a thicket of overgrown grass and weeds behind the Supreme Industrial Equipment Co. in Woodside are two arching structures made of wood, cardboard and blue tarps. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Underneath lie mattresses and blankets. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This crude dwelling is what several day laborers from Mexico call home. The immigrants reside unseen by the thousands of drivers, train passengers and pedestrians that pass by every day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With a shortage of city shelters for men in Queens, apartment rents rising, and undocumented immigrants afraid to seek city services, some day laborers have turned to the shanty communities to live, according advocates for immigrants and the homeless. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&rsquo;Serious homeless problem&rsquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;People are just waking up to the fact that we have a serious homeless problem in this borough,&rdquo; said Camilla Williams, director of the homeless outreach program for the Salvation Army of Greater New York. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Though there is no exact count of how many people are living in shanties in New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police, who are responsible for the safety and maintenance of property along the Long Island Rail Road tracks, estimate the number to be in the low hundreds. According to officials, the dwellers are men, many of them immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When MTA police visited the Woodside shanty community on a recent afternoon, the day laborers were out working or looking for work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Policia. Anybody home?&rdquo; Officer James Hidalgo shouted. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Broken eggshells, beer cans, shattered cassette tapes and pans with old food littered the ground among mounds of clothes, dated Spanish-language newspapers, and wedding photos. Shirts, jackets and pants were slung over thin tree branches. 
			</p>
			<p>
				No official comment 
			</p>
			<p>
				MTA spokesman Tom Kelly refused to comment about these crude dwellings, citing pending litigation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The city is being sued for $50 million by a woman who was beaten and raped more than a year ago near the Long Island Rail Road&rsquo;s Shea Stadium station by five men, some of whom were living in shanties. In the criminal case, all five defendants pleaded guilty to rape and other charges and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 20 to 23 years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The issue is &ldquo;a major concern that is being closely monitored,&rdquo; Alexandra Rosa, chief of staff to Queens Borough President Helen Marshall, said about the makeshift dwellings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hidalgo&rsquo;s partner, Officer Robert Koehler, said the MTA has been reaching out to the immigrant dwellers and convincing them to seek help at shelters for the homeless. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When Hidalgo and I started on this beat almost two years ago, we had at least 29 shanty locations in Queens,&rdquo; Koehler said. &ldquo;Now there are about nine left to clean out.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Koehler and Hidalgo, day laborers have been setting up these makeshift living areas in Queens for years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Attempts to help 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried arresting them,&rdquo; Koehler said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve even tried bringing in the Salvation Army to offer them shelter, but many don&rsquo;t want it. They prefer to stay put,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For day laborers, Hidalgo said, location is key. Their value of property has nothing to do with space or having walls. Instead, they prefer a secluded place close to where they can find work. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There just aren&rsquo;t enough shelters in Queens, and for them to go all the way to Manhattan or the Bronx would mean losing work,&rdquo; Hidalgo said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Williams said that with a weak economy, many of the immigrant men are bringing home as little as $20 a day and can&rsquo;t afford to live in apartments and still send money back home to their families in their native countries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For Officers Koehler and Hidalgo, the issue is complex. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The problem is that most of these guys just want to be left alone,&rdquo; Koehler said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They want to make an honest, quiet living similar to the way they did back in their home country,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They do it just so they can put in a hard day&rsquo;s work and send money home to their families. Is that a crime that warrants tearing down their homes and arresting them?&rdquo;
