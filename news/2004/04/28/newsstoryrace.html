			<h1>
				The Ombudsman: Why Don&rsquo;t Some Articles Identify Suspects by Race?
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Tony Marcano (Sacramento Bee Ombudsman), sacbee.com, Apr. 25</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				We&rsquo;ve all heard the maxim that bringing up politics, religion or sex in polite company is a faux pas. But if you&rsquo;re talking about newsrooms &mdash; hardly bastions of polite company &mdash; the subject most likely to touch a nerve is race. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The topic was brought up a few times in the last couple of weeks by readers who wanted to know why some crime articles failed to identify the suspects by race. The question, in some of those instances, was accompanied by accusations of political correctness. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One reader, Scott Neville of Sacramento, cited as an example an April 14 article about a series of home invasion robberies of elderly women in South Land Park. &ldquo;Time and time again,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;the editors of our friendly and helpful neighborhood newspaper would choose to endanger the citizens of our city rather than report the racial characteristics of still-at-large criminal suspects.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				He went on to note that the Sacramento Police Department asked the public to help by calling 911 if they saw any suspicious activity. &ldquo;How can anyone be on the lookout for these bad guys,&rdquo; Neville asked, &ldquo;when the only information your newspaper will print is that they are in their 20s and are of average height?&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				That&rsquo;s the kind of question that can twist an editor&rsquo;s brain into a knot. That&rsquo;s because in one respect, Neville and the other readers who had similar comments are right. What good is a description that says only that the suspects are twenty-something men of average height, which could apply to millions of guys? 
			</p>
			<p>
				About as much good as a description that says only that the suspects were three twenty-something African-American men of average height &mdash; which is to say, not much. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Like many newspapers, The Bee&rsquo;s policy is to identify criminal suspects by race &mdash; and that means any race, not just so-called minorities &mdash; only when it&rsquo;s part of a complete description. For example, here&rsquo;s how a suspect was described in an April 17 article about a police search for a man armed with a black or chrome pistol who robbed four fast-food restaurants: &ldquo;The robber is described as an African American in his mid-20s, 5-foot-8 to 6-foot-2, 180 to 230 pounds with his hair in dreadlocks. He was wearing a hooded black puffy jacket, dark pants, white shoes, black gloves, a black ski mask and a black &lsquo;Nike&rsquo; beanie.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				That description was far from perfect &mdash; 5-foot-8 to 6-foot-2 is a considerable range, and any racial description is problematic. (More on that in a moment.) But at least it had some specific identifying characteristics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Bee Deputy Managing Editor Mort Saltzman said the paper tends to receive three kinds of complaints when the paper does not use race in descriptions of criminal suspects. &ldquo;Some readers call whose reasoning is that the role of newspapers is to give out as much information as possible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a reasonable argument.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem with that argument, however, is that it can hurt the search for a suspect as much as it can help. Witness descriptions are often notoriously inaccurate, as illustrated by the &ldquo;5-foot-8 to 6-foot-2&rdquo; description in the example above. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The second argument, Saltzman said, is that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the liberal Bee being politically correct.&rdquo; But if the purpose of running descriptions is to help the police ferret out suspects, a partial description can result in too many false leads, not to mention the heightened possibility of racial profiling. &ldquo;You call it politically correct,&rdquo; Saltzman said of readers who hurl the PC charge. &ldquo;I call it relevance and the right thing to do.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The third argument, I think, is frankly racist,&rdquo; Saltzman said. &ldquo;Some people who call in want to solidify their own belief that all crimes in Sacramento are committed by African-American men and Mexican-American men.&rdquo; I agree. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I also agree with Saltzman&rsquo;s assessment that The Bee&rsquo;s policy on racial identifications in crime stories is applied inconsistently. That&rsquo;s a real problem, because consistency equals credibility. I&rsquo;ve seen some crime stories with partial descriptions of suspects, others with none at all. I&rsquo;d rather see them go unused than to put out a few vague characteristics that, instead of serving the common good, will unnecessarily generate fear, anxiety, divisiveness and prejudice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But let&rsquo;s put those arguments against using racial identification aside in favor of one, advanced by Saltzman and Assistant Managing Editor Scott Lebar, who oversees Metro coverage, that is much more relevant and much more persuasive. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I think the paper has a larger responsibility than perpetuating misguided and vague identifications via race, a characteristic that has grown increasingly fluid in our culture, particularly in California,&rdquo; Lebar said. &ldquo;Accuracy is still key here and I distrust the accuracy of these descriptions. More, I distrust what we accomplish by using racial IDs, especially ones that are convenient for witnesses and cops. I&rsquo;m not sure identifying someone as African American or white with limited other description helps at all.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neither am I. As Saltzman pointed out, traditional racial descriptions are fast becoming outdated, and thus inaccurate. For example, if I were a crime suspect here on the West Coast, where vast swaths of the populace seem to believe that all men with roots in Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations look like Ricky Ricardo, I have no doubt I would be described solely as African-American, but that would be only partially correct. Back home in New York, I&rsquo;d be pegged as Dominican, Puerto Rican or that catchall phrase, &ldquo;dark-skinned Hispanic.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The point is, my heritage is much more complicated than the woefully inadequate, Census-based, socially biased descriptions that government and law enforcement agencies persist in perpetuating. The same can be said for millions of other Americans. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Race, of course, remains a defining characteristic of life in America, so to abandon all racial descriptions would be irresponsible. But to use them, particularly in crime stories, without an eye toward the very factors that make race a defining characteristic of life in America would be worse.
