				<a href="http://www.collegiatenetwork.org/">Threats and Theft at Wayne State</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>J. Justin Wilson, The Collegiate Network, Apr. 23</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				This week, having just distributed the second edition of the <i>Wayne Review</i>, the staff woke up to find their entire print run missing and replaced by a threatening letter that warned them to &ldquo;not forget what city your are in &mdash; take is back to the &lsquo;burbs!!!!!!!&rdquo; It went on to threaten that, &ldquo;we know who you are, and just as views like those expressed in this showcase contribute to extremities in policies that disproportionately effect people of color in a negative fashion, we will be sure the individuals responsible for this showcase are affected as well.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Stealing papers strikes at the core of the first amendment and only exposes the pathetic nature of the thieves. Rather than air their grievances in a publicly appropriate manner, they sought to censor the <i>Review</i>. This is the same mentality that segregationists used 40 years ago to impede the civil rights movement from making inroads. The hypocrisy is appalling.

				The Wayne Review Distribution Racks, Display Vandalized
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Joe Koss and The Wayne Review staff, South End Online, Apr. 26</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Wayne Review was victim to a series of attacks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Last Thursday, Wayne State University staff members found the distribution rack in State Hall vandalized with flyers containing hate speech and threats. Also, all of the newspapers were stolen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Along with the distribution rack in State Hall, the display case &mdash; which the Review was occupying in the Student Center &mdash; had the same flyer. The flyer was in response to an opinion piece in the second issue that condemned affirmative action on the basis that the policy hurts minorities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Though the views in the Wayne Review are conservative in nature and WSU has a primarily liberal student body, limiting such views is intolerance and bigotry at its worst,&rdquo; wrote Joe Koss, editor-in-chief of The Wayne Review in a press release. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Free speech on a campus or anywhere in America is a principal freedom necessary to ensure democracy, liberty and equality. Diversity in all aspects of humanity is necessary to create a vibrant and progressive atmosphere that fosters new thought and innovation. The attempts to limit free speech are often made by individuals wishing to prevent ideas that are popular or promote diversity. Censorship is the weapon of the intolerant and the enemy of liberty,&rdquo; Koss added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The language and message conveyed within the flyer clearly represent only the views of the perpetrators themselves and their intolerant views. Due to concerns of safety, The Wayne Review is taking action to ensure that the staff and their freedom to express ideas are able to operate in a safe, non-hostile environment, Koss said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Wayne Review is a conservative independent student-run newspaper on the campus. It operates on donations and receives no funding from the University. They publish with grants and donations &mdash; each printing of the publication is difficult and costly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Koss said any vandalism or theft is impossible to replace. And he said those who attacked the Review clearly want to censor freedom of speech, and they feel the way to achieve this is through intimidation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The Wayne Review is committed to intellectual diversity, and when individuals decide to hinder this goal, all those who stand for freedom must denounce such actions in the name of liberty,&rdquo; Koss said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite the recent vandalism, he said the Review will continue to print and fight for freedom, liberty and American principles.
