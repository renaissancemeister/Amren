				<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2845397">&lsquo;Ancestral&rsquo; DNA Clue in Serial Rapist Hunt</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Laura Elston, PA News, Scotsman.com, Apr. 27 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				A groundbreaking DNA technique has brought police a step closer to hunting down a serial rapist who preys on elderly women, Scotland Yard said today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Detectives have turned to an advanced form of ancestral testing to pinpoint the man&rsquo;s background and have discovered his origins lie in the Caribbean. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rapist, who targets lone female pensioners and breaks into their homes, is believed to have been responsible for more than 80 offences across south London, including four rapes and 27 indecent assaults, over a 12-year period. 
			</p>
			<p>
				DNA tests will now be carried out voluntarily on Metropolitan Police officers with proven Caribbean origins to compare profiles and help determine which island the man or his family might have come from. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The technology has never been used in the UK before and has developed out of research which helped detectives discover the roots of Adam, the boy whose torso was found in the River Thames. 
			</p>
			<p>
				DNA found at some of the attack scenes, including semen, was taken to the US and examined by scientists at DNA Print Genomics in Florida, who have developed a way of identifying markers which show ancestral blood lines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The attacker&rsquo;s DNA contains Native American, European and Sub-Saharan &mdash; which originates from slave trade Africa &mdash; strands. The combination is only found in the Caribbean. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The hunt to find the rapist, Operation Minstead, is the largest ever undertaken by the Metropolitan Police. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The man is believed to be around 35 years old and is black, possibly light-skinned. 
			</p>
			<p>
				During his horrific crimes, he enters the homes of elderly women in the early hours of the morning, often cutting electricity and telephone wires and removing light bulbs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He wears a balaclava and a distinctive all-in-one nylon black catsuit, which police now believe may be a motorcycle outfit. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It has also emerged that he may have links to Brighton, after mentioning the area during one of his offences.
