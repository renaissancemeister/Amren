			<h1>
				Bishops Plead for Border Crossers
			</h1>
			<p class="subhead">
				Parishioners urged: See Jesus in their faces 
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Stephanie Innes, Arizona Daily Star, Apr. 24</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Catholic bishops from Tucson, Phoenix and Hermosillo are calling on parishioners to see Jesus Christ in the faces of the men, women and children who continue to make grueling illegal border treks into the United States from Mexico. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Whatever happens to the least of us is what happens to Christ,&rdquo; said Bishop Thomas J. Olmstead of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix. Olmstead was in Tucson on Friday to attend a border and migration conference at Our Mother of Sorrows Catholic Church, 1800 S. Kolb Road. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As part of a stepped-up effort by people of faith to address immigration issues on the border, the Catholic dioceses of Tucson, Phoenix and Hermosillo, Sonora, have fashioned their own program of mobilizing Catholics called &ldquo;Encuentro: Dioceses without Borders.&rdquo; The premise is simple: promoting a faith community that transcends political divisions through a shared gospel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Catholic leaders say they want their parishioners to see the human faces behind the staggering numbers of illegal crossers who are dying in the desert while searching for a better life &mdash; 515 fatalities since 2000, according to Monsignor Tom Cahalane of Our Mother of Sorrows. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Parishioners at Our Mother of Sorrows keep a tally on a simple white cross on the west side of the building that serves as the site of a weekly prayer vigil. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one church and we have to work together. We have to share our power, our experiences,&rdquo; said the Rev. Faustino Armendariz Jimenez, who attended on behalf of Archbishop Ulises Macias Salcedo of the Archdiocese of Hermosillo. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jimenez conceded that promoting greater understanding about the risks of crossing to Mexicans is one piece of a more complex puzzle for Mexico, where the government is often indifferent to a desperate economic underclass. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A &ldquo;Covenant of Solidarity&rdquo; signed by the bishops of all three dioceses in 2002 called for transcending the physical border that divides the United States and Mexico through hospitality and the promotion of economic and social justice in communities in both countries. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This is an opportunity to follow up,&rdquo; said Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas of the Diocese of Tucson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning now to learn about one another and work more collaboratively together.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kicanas said issues on the border have raised a wide range of moral concerns for Catholics, including dignity, protection of human life and reaching out to those who are struggling and in danger. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When there is a policy that leads to so many deaths, one would have to question the effectiveness of that policy.&rdquo;
