				Schools to Teach UK&rsquo;s Six Main Religions
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i> Richard Garner, independent.co.uk, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Children should begin to learn about another religion alongside Christianity from the age of five, according to new government guidelines on teaching religious education published yesterday. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By the time they have finished compulsory education, they should have learnt about the six principal religions represented in the UK &mdash; Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A report drawn up by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) &mdash; the government&rsquo;s curriculum and examinations watchdog, says: &ldquo;It is important that schools make every effort to ensure that during their school life pupils encounter the principal religions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report also calls on young people to study other minority religious traditions, singling out the Baha&rsquo;i faith, Jainism and Zoroastrianism, in particular. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pupils should also consider secular philosophies, such as humanism &ldquo;in considering ultimate questions and ethical issues&rdquo;, the report adds. The document says that pupils should be able to study minority religions that have a following in their community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In different areas of the country, this could mean the study of a different minority sect. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yesterday&rsquo;s report was broadly welcomed by all the faith groups. The Church of England said that it recognised the &ldquo;sensitivity with which the Government and the QCA have handled the process&rdquo; of devising a religious education curriculum. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Muslim Council of Britain and the Muslim Educational Trust said: &ldquo;The Muslim community welcomes this initiative as it seeks to promote a pluralistic society where one can retain both individual integrity as well as share that which is of corporate value and benefit for us all.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The guidelines make it clear that Christianity should be studied by all pupils throughout their schooling &mdash; as the country&rsquo;s main religion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, pupils should also study one other religion between the ages of five and seven, at least two more between the age of seven and 11 and at least a further two between the age of 11 and 14 &mdash; so that they cover all of the principal religions by the time they leave school. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The guidelines add that teachers should aim to develop good relationships that respect the differences of people and warn of the &ldquo;destructive power of prejudice&rdquo; and the challenge of &ldquo;racism, discrimination, offending behaviour and bullying&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Between the ages of five and seven, pupils should visit different places of worship and understand &ldquo;how and why religious people celebrate&rdquo;, the report says. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcoming the guidelines yesterday, Charles Clarke, the Secretary of State for Education, said: &ldquo;Religious education plays an important part in our children&rsquo;s spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. This is why we are making moves to strengthen its teaching in schools.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				The guidance, which is now going out for consultation, is not statutory &mdash; so schools will not be forced to follow it. But many are expected to follow its principles. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr Ken Boston, the chief executive of the QCA, said: &ldquo;Religious education in this country is based on two principles &mdash; that it should be a statutory part of education for all pupils and that it should reflect the particular needs and circumstances of local communities.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>PROPOSED CHANGES FOR RELIGIOUS EDUCATION</b> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Pupils will be taught on the six main religions: Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The three minority religions mentioned in the guidance are: 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Baha&rsquo;i: </b>one of the world&rsquo;s youngest religions,it was practised by Dr David Kelly, the late Iraqi weapons expert. Its followers promote pacifism, gender equality and tolerance of other religions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Jainism:</b> One of the three ancient religions to originate on the Indian sub-continent. Jains believe in reincarnation and believe humans can gain immortality through a life of harmlessness and renunciation. Most followers are vegetarian, many are celibate. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Zoroastrianism:</b> Founded in Persia by Zarathustra between 1500 and 1000BC, its followers believe life is a cosmic power struggle between good and evil. The late rock star, Freddie Mercury, of Queen, was a Zoroastrian.
