			<h1>
				Activist Tells Human Side of Brothers, Her Border Arrest
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Yvonne Wingett, Arizona Republic, Apr. 27</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lizabeth Ramon de Harvey says the story isn&rsquo;t about her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s about two boys, an outdated immigration system and a family torn apart. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though she was arrested and charged with smuggling Carlos Morales-Vera, 20, and his 15-year-old brother into the country, Ramon de Harvey won&rsquo;t back off resuming the role of immigrant activist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We need to stop treating this as just an &lsquo;immigration&rsquo; issue,&rdquo; said Ramon de Harvey, who is helping to appeal the brothers&rsquo; deportation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just do it through lunches and banquets. I&rsquo;m not going away.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said the media, anti-immigration advocates and immigration activists have crucified her for a spontaneous decision that came from her heart, not her head. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With the undocumented brothers hiding in her trunk on April 15, Ramon de Harvey sat behind the wheel of her Chevy Beretta, inching north toward the port of entry in Nogales. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The smell of gasoline permeated the air as she watched children peddling candy and U.S. Customs officials searching some car trunks while letting others drive through to Arizona without a search. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A voice told her to turn back as she pulled up to an inquisitive customs agent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Where are you coming from?&rdquo; he asked the 40-year-old Latina activist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ramon de Harvey was nervous, her heart pounded. She fumbled with the radio dial. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Visiting a sick friend,&rdquo; she lied. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Open your trunk,&rdquo; officials told her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Her heart sank and out crawled Morales-Vera and his younger brother, who had been deported to Mexico from their two-bedroom apartment in northeast Phoenix&rsquo;s Palomino neighborhood a week earlier. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Within seconds, all three were in handcuffs and being led to a cold holding room. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ramon de Harvey, the girlfriend of Phoenix Assistant Police Chief Silverio Ontiveros, was facing federal felony charges, five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She pleaded guilty to attempting to sneak the brothers into the country and faces a year of probation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ontiveros, meanwhile, is under investigation to determine whether he had any role in the smuggling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many have said she hurt the plight of immigrants. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She said the brothers&rsquo; futures were at stake and she will continue to be heard on the matter, especially for young people like Morales-Vera and his brother. 
			</p>
			<p>
				They are fluent in English and spent the bulk of their lives attending school in Phoenix. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Morales-Vera, a top student in the criminal justice program at Paradise Valley Community College, watched his dreams of becoming a law enforcer vanish. 
			</p>
			<p>
				His little brother is a sharp but shy student who laughs a lot, Ramon de Harvey said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The pair, brought here from Monterrey, Mexico, 13 years ago, never asked to come to this country, Ramon de Harvey said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But they were quick to assimilate, learned English and attended school, never fully comprehending the complexities of this country&rsquo;s immigration laws. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Until they found themselves living in Mexico, a country where they were born but which they did not know, eating and sleeping with other young deportees in <i>Albergue de Transicion de Menores Repatriados</i>, a shelter for recently repatriated young males. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When the brothers visited the U.S. Consulate in Nogales, hoping to go back home, they were turned away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I saw (Morales-Vera) over there, he was ashamed, with his head down,&rdquo; remembered Ramon de Harvey, who entered this country illegally two decades ago, crossing three borders from El Salvador to Texas by foot, train and produce truck. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This kid (Morales-Vera) was in pain,&rdquo; she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I feel that he had aged since the last time I saw him. But he did nothing wrong. He did nothing wrong.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				Ramon de Harvey knows she did, but that won&rsquo;t stop her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to continue knocking on doors,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some doors are going to stay open, others are going to stay closed.&rdquo;
