			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, Telegraph, Apr. 1</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Jewish leaders accused the European Union yesterday of covering up the true scale of anti-Semitic violence carried out by Muslim youths, reigniting a controversy over Europe&rsquo;s failure to confront Islamic extremism at home. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A study released by the EU&rsquo;s racism and xenophobia monitoring centre astounded experts by concluding that the wave of anti-Jewish persecution over the last two years stemmed from neo-Nazi or other racist groups. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The largest group of the perpetrators of anti-Semitic activities appears to be young, disaffected white Europeans,&rdquo; said a summary released to the European Parliament . &ldquo;A further source of anti-Semitism in some countries was young Muslims of North African or Asian extraction. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Traditionally, anti-Semitic groups on the extreme Right played a part in stirring opinion,&rdquo; it added. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The headline findings contradict the body of the report. This says most of the 193 violent attacks on synagogues, Jewish schools, kosher shops, cemeteries and rabbis in France in 2002 &mdash; up from 32 in 2001 &mdash; were &ldquo;ascribed to youth from neighbourhoods sensitive to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, principally of North African descent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The percentage attributable to the extreme Right was only nine per cent in 2002,&rdquo; it said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The report on Belgium said most of the fire-bomb and machine-gun attacks on Jewish targets were the result of a spillover from the Palestinian intifada. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The European Jewish Congress accused the EU watchdog of twisting data from the 15 member states to suit its own ideological bias, describing the report as a catalogue of &ldquo;enormous contradictions, errors and omissions.&rdquo; 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We cannot let it be said that the majority of anti-Semitic incidents come from young, disaffected white men. This is in complete contradiction with the facts recorded by the police,&rdquo; it said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The EU suppressed a report last year by German academics concluding that Arab gangs were largely responsible for a sudden surge in the anti-Jewish violence, allegedly because the findings were politically unpalatable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Victor Weitzel, who wrote a large section of yesterday&rsquo;s far more detailed study, told The Telegraph that the latest findings had been consistently massaged by the EU watchdog to play down the role of North African youth. &ldquo;The European Union seems incapable of facing up to the truth on this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything is being tilted to ensure nice soft conclusions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I told them that we need to monitor the inflammatory language being used by the Arab press in Europe, this was changed to the &lsquo;minority press&rsquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Honestly, it&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; he said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Weitzel&rsquo;s 48-page section &mdash; compiled with a Polish academic, Magadalena Sroda &mdash; is the fruit of months of interviews with Jewish leaders across Europe. While far-Right and traditional &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; forms of anti-Semitism still exist, the report homes in on a new form of &ldquo;anti-Zionist Left&rdquo; prejudice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This demonises Israel and subtly leaks into prejudice against all Jews. The study describes Belgium as a country where anti-Semitism has become almost fashionable among the Left-leaning intelligentsia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But most of the report focuses on Jew-baiting by Muslim youths. It paints an alarming picture of daily life for France&rsquo;s 600,000 Jews, the EU&rsquo;s biggest community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In schools, Jewish children are beaten with impunity, and teachers dare not talk about the Holocaust for fear of provoking Muslim pupils, it said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Britain, which saw a 75 per cent rise in incidents last year, was gently rebuked for hesitating to take &ldquo;politically awkward&rdquo; measures against Islamic radicals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The government is very anxious not to upset the Muslim community,&rdquo; the report said.
