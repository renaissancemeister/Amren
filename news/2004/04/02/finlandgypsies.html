				Finland Rejects Nearly All Slovak Asylum-Seekers 
			</h1>
			<p>
				<i>Euobserver.com, Mar. 19 </i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nearly all Slovak asylum-seekers have had their applications refused in Finland so far this year, reports the Helsingin Sanomat. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This year over 200 members of Slovakia&rsquo;s Roma or Gipsy minority have applied for political asylum in Finland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Matti Heinonen of the Directorate of Immigration, nearly all applications have so far been denied. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of these asylum-seekers have applied for asylum in Finland before and 40 percent of them have applied in one other EU member state as well. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yesterday (18 March), another 50 asylum-seekers were expected to arrive in Finland. Finnish police were preparing in advance how to send them back the least expensive way, writes the Finnish daily. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea is to send them back as soon as possible, in order to discourage others to make groundless asylum applications, said Jaakko Heinil&auml; of the Helsinki Police Department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Helsingin Sanomat, the gap of the living standard is so big, that the money the asylum-seekers have been paid by Finland&rsquo;s refugee reception centers is a &ldquo;considerable economic boost when the rejected asylum-seekers return home&rdquo;. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Asylum-seekers very often live in the same area or villages, they often travel by bus to Prague and fly from there to Finland. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A total of 3184 persons sought asylum in Finland in 2003. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Finnish Directorate of Immigration 2443 applicants received a negative decision on their application. They were granted neither asylum nor a residence permit.
