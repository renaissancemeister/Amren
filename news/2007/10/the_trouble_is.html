<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It was a heinous murder that made the best-selling memoirist Ayaan Hirsi Ali internationally famous, but she was neither the victim nor the perpetrator. The corpse was that of Theo van Gogh, a writer and filmmaker who in November 2004 was stabbed, slashed, and shot on an Amsterdam street by a Dutch-born Muslim extremist of Moroccan descent.</p>
<p>The assassin, driven to rage by <cite>Submission,</cite> a short film Van Gogh had made about the poor treatment of women under Islam, left no doubt about his motives. A letter he pinned to his victim&rsquo;s chest with a knife was a call to jihad. It was also a death threat against Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a member of the Dutch parliament. She had persuaded Van Gogh to make <cite>Submission</cite> and had written the movie&rsquo;s script.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Reason: </b>Should we acknowledge that organized religion has sometimes sparked precisely the kinds of emancipation movements that could lift Islam into modern times? Slavery in the United States ended in part because of opposition by prominent church members and the communities they galvanized. The Polish Catholic Church helped defeat the Jaruzelski puppet regime. Do you think Islam could bring about similar social and political changes?</p>
<p><b>Hirsi Ali: </b>Only if Islam is defeated. Because right now, the political side of Islam, the power-hungry expansionist side of Islam, has become superior to the Sufis and the Ismailis and the peace-seeking Muslims.</p>
<p><b>Reason: </b>Don&rsquo;t you mean defeating <em>radical</em> Islam?</p>
<p><b>Hirsi Ali: </b>No. Islam, period. Once it&rsquo;s defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It&rsquo;s very difficult to even talk about peace now. They&rsquo;re not interested in peace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Reason: </b>Having lived in the United States for about a year now, do you find that Muslims in the United States have by and large integrated better here than they have in Europe?</p>
<p><b>Hirsi Ali: </b>Since I moved here, I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time in airports, in airplanes, in waiting rooms, in hotels, doing promotion for Infidel all over the world, so the amount of time I&rsquo;ve actually lived in the U.S. is very small. But yes, I have the impression that Muslims in the United States are far more integrated than Muslims in Europe. Of course, being assimilated doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you won&rsquo;t be a jihadist, but the likelihood of Muslims turning radical here seems lower than in Europe.</p>
<p>For one thing, America doesn&rsquo;t really have a welfare system. Mohammed Bouyeri had all day long to plot the murder of Theo van Gogh. American Muslims have to get a job. What pushes people who come to America to assimilate is that it&rsquo;s expected of them. And people are not mollycoddled by the government.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of white guilt in America, but it&rsquo;s directed toward black Americans and native Indians, not toward Muslims and other immigrants. People come from China, Vietnam, and all kinds of Muslim countries. To the average American, they&rsquo;re all fellow immigrants.</p>
<p>The white guilt in Germany and Holland and the U.K. is very different. It has to do with colonialism. It has to do with Dutch emigrants having spread apartheid in South Africa. It has to do with the Holocaust. So the mind-set toward immigrants in Europe is far more complex than here. Europeans are more reticent about saying no to immigrants.</p>
<p>And by and large, Muslim immigrants in Europe do not come with the intention to assimilate. They come with the intention to work, earn some money, and go back. That&rsquo;s how the first wave of immigrants in the Netherlands was perceived: They would just come to work and then they&rsquo;d go away. The newer generations that have followed are coming not so much to work and more to reap the benefits of the welfare state. Again, assimilation is not really on their minds.</p>
<p>Also, in order to get official status here in the U.S., you have to have an employer, so it&rsquo;s the employable who are coming. The Arabs who live here came as businessmen, and a lot of them come from wealthy backgrounds. There are also large communities of Indian and Pakistani Muslims, who tend to be very liberal. Compare that to the Turks in Germany, who mostly come from the poor villages of Anatolia. Or compare it to the Moroccans in the Netherlands, who are for the most part Berbers with a similar socio-economic background. It&rsquo;s a completely different set of people.</p>
<p>And finally, there&rsquo;s the matter of borders. In America, Muslim immigrants typically pass through an airport, which means the Americans have a better way of controlling who comes in &mdash; a far cry from Europe&rsquo;s open borders. Forty years ago, when Europe began talking about lifting borders between countries to facilitate the free traffic of goods and labor, they weren&rsquo;t thinking about waves of immigrants. They thought of Europe as a place people left. America, on the other hand, has always been an immigration nation, with border controls that have been in place for a long time. I know the southern border is difficult to monitor, but for Arab Muslims and Pakistanis coming to America, it&rsquo;s very hard to enter illegally.</p>
<p>Without passing any moral judgment, those are the differences between the two places.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Reason: </b>Tolerance is probably the most powerful word there is in the Netherlands. No other word encapsulates better what the Dutch believe really defines them. That makes it very easy for people to say that when they&rsquo;re being criticized, they&rsquo;re not being tolerated &mdash; and from there it&rsquo;s only a small step to saying they&rsquo;re being discriminated against or they&rsquo;re the victims of Islamophobia or racism or what have you.</p>
<p><b>Hirsi Ali: </b>We have to revert to the original meaning of the term tolerance. It meant you agreed to disagree without violence. It meant critical self-reflection. It meant not tolerating the intolerant. It also came to mean a very high level of personal freedom.</p>
<p>Then the Muslims arrived, and they hadn&rsquo;t grown up with that understanding of tolerance. In short order, tolerance was now defined by multiculturalism, the idea that all cultures and religions are equal. Expectations were created among the Muslim population. They were told they could preserve their own culture, their own religion. The vocabulary was quickly established that if you criticize someone of color, you&rsquo;re a racist, and if you criticize Islam, you&rsquo;re an Islamophobe.</p>
<p><b>Reason: </b>The international corollary to the word tolerance is probably respect. The alleged lack of respect has become a perennial sore spot in relations between the West and Islam. Salman Rushdie receiving a British knighthood supposedly signified such a lack of respect, as did the Danish cartoons last year, and many other things. Do you believe this is what Muslims genuinely crave &mdash; respect?</p>
<p><b>Hirsi Ali: </b>It&rsquo;s not about respect. It&rsquo;s about power, and Islam is a political movement.</p>
<p><b>Reason: </b>Uniquely so?</p>
<p><b>Hirsi Ali: </b>Well, it hasn&rsquo;t been tamed like Christianity. See, the Christian powers have accepted the separation of the worldly and the divine. We don&rsquo;t interfere with their religion, and they don&rsquo;t interfere with the state. That hasn&rsquo;t happened in Islam.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t even think that the trouble is Islam. The trouble is the West, because in the West there&rsquo;s this notion that we are invincible and that everyone will modernize anyway, and that what we are seeing now in Muslim countries is a craving for respect. Or it&rsquo;s poverty, or it&rsquo;s caused by colonization.</p>
<p>The Western mind-set &mdash; that if we respect them, they&rsquo;re going to respect us, that if we indulge and appease and condone and so on, the problem will go away &mdash; is delusional. The problem is not going to go away. Confront it, or it&rsquo;s only going to get bigger.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Dutch government said that it would no longer foot an annual bill of roughly $3 million for Hirsi Ali while she lives in the United States.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, where Hirsi Ali is a scholar, said that the institute was processing private donations for her protection as of Tuesday and that a second fund has been set up by her Dutch lawyers.</p>
