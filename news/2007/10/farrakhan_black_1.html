<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In a speech that touched on global warming, environmentalism and Georgia&rsquo;s drought, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan drew parallels that as the earth withers, so too do black men, who have little to show for 452 years of bondage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Politics and the racial environment is threatening the human family,&#8221; Farrakhan said. &#8220;But black males, in particular, are endangered. Our attitudes, our ignorance, our savagery are all lending to a plan &mdash; a conspiracy to make the black man, not endangered, but extinct.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If God doesn&rsquo;t intervene, we will be extinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;God made a call for black men to take a stand.&nbsp.;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [We] showed up for atonement and reconciliation,&#8221; said Ishmael Muhammad, the Nation&rsquo;s national assistant minister. &#8220;We accepted 12 years ago the responsibility to be better men, better fathers and better husbands. It was a day never before experienced in our history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farrakhan spoke for more than two hours in a speech that touched on religion, hip-hop, politics and the perception that some successful blacks are being propped up by whites and refusing to reach back and help poor blacks for fear of losing their status.</p>
<p>He said that includes some members of the civil rights movement who abandoned the movement after Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s death in order to be accepted by white America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farrakhan noted that although successful blacks exist, blacks have the lowest level of health care and are losing what they have at an alarming rate. He said that although Oprah Winfrey is one of the richest women in the world, 37 million people are living in poverty and one-third of them are black. He added that although Barack Obama is a presidential front-runner, blacks continue to lose their right to vote because of voter identification laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking about rapper T.I., who is facing federal gun charges, Farrakhan said the charges are less about what he is charged with and more about the fact that his music is influencing white kids, who account for more than 80 percent of the purchases of rap and hip-hop music.</p>
<p>He went on to talk about Atlanta&rsquo;s other fallen son, Michael Vick.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know our brother broke the law. God himself is displeased, because he has given us dominion over his creatures and he doesn&rsquo;t want us to abuse them for sport,&#8221; said Farrakhan, before coming to a near whisper. &#8220;But they didn&rsquo;t have to come down on the brother like that. He is young, black and super rich. And all of those white children were wearing his jersey. White people were losing control of their children to black sports and entertainment figures, and they can&rsquo;t take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to link Vick&rsquo;s crimes to global conflicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is worse?&#8221; he asked, comparing dog fighting to war. &#8220;To send a recruiter into black and Hispanic neighborhoods to offer you money to come into the armed forces to go to Iraq and Afghanistan for political reasons to kill people?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The female members of the Nation stood out as well &mdash; most wearing stark white garments and headdresses. During one portion of the event, thousands of dollars was raised with the name of each person or group that gave at least $100 &mdash; including Smooches Sexy Plus Style Boutique &mdash; being called. At another point, before Farrakhan spoke, Charles Steele, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, broke the podium in excitement as he talked about how the Nation of Islam leader inspired him.</p>

					<p>452 years of bondage?</p>
<p>Ironically, Barack Obama, in the story where we found out that he was Dick Cheney&rsquo;s 8th cousin and George W. Bush&rsquo;s 9th cousin once removed, we also found out that he has slave owners in his lineage but no slaves were.  So if reparations come, will <span class="caps">BHO </span>have to pay?</p>

					<p>Nothing of importance here - just an act, an old act - Farrakhan is old. He throws out little barbs for people to say &#8220;yes that&rsquo;s right&#8221;, but that&rsquo;s very little to the <span class="caps">NOI </span>program besides having some Black men dress in a presentable way to sell the newspaper. If you see the Black men dressed in a presentable way selling the newspaper, it is ok to buy the paper or give them some respect and encouragement, the men who are selling the newspaper are not up to other no good activities. Still the appeal of the <span class="caps">NOI </span>is still &#8220;hate whitey&#8221;, &#8220;blame white people&#8221;, &#8220;make excuses for Blacks like Michael Vick or Hip Hop Black rappers or all of Black Africa.</p>

					<p>The Khan sounds tired- I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s exhausting being a hate monger.  I suppose it is also exhausting preaching the same sermon to the same group of sinning brothas and sistas who just don&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t)get it.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it still comes back to &#8220;blame whitey&#8221;.  So brotha Michael sinned by beating those dogs- the blue eyed devuh&rsquo;s offspring made him do it, and rapper TI?  He wouldn&rsquo;t have all these problems if da devuhs chilren would quit buying his stuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second verse, same as the first&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

					<p>This clown is still alive??<br>
My surprise reflected in the previous sentence aside, I like how he seems to know exactly what God is thinking, and how if God doesn&rsquo;t help blacks, they will die out. A religious person might then point out that blacks are very likely screwed.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize whites had so much power. I wish it  were true, not so I could irrationally harm Mr. Vick but to abandon all the anti-white policies that abound in this nation. Farrakhan does say some things to blacks that really need to be said, however he&rsquo;s just another typical kook from that segment of society-Screwy Louie.</p>

					<p>First and on a humorous take, is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At another point, before Farrakhan spoke, Charles Steele, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, broke the podium in excitement as he talked about how the Nation of Islam leader inspired him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what was that, which &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; Farrakhan spoke about regarding ignorance and destructiveness in his speech, regarding black males? Was it inspirationally improvised by the mini Detroit, that Comrade Steele made of his podium?</p>
<p>If so, while I will continue to hold that &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; Farrakhan is a psychopath, he has impressed me with his cleverness here!</p>
<p>Second and last, is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went on to link Vick&rsquo;s crimes to global conflicts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is worse?&rsquo; he asked, comparing dog fighting to war. &lsquo;To send a recruiter into black and Hispanic neighborhoods to offer you money to come into the armed forces to go to Iraq and Afghanistan for political reasons to kill people?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, is why I continue to hold that this man is at best, a megalomaniacal psychopath!</p>
<p>By perpetuating a myth, that a tsunami &ldquo;of color&rdquo; as united under Islam as the molecules for water and salt are in the oceans is storming the globe, is madness beyond any sane person&rsquo;s comprehension, regardless of race. Yes, the West is threatened by Islam and the rainbow of the Third World, but these are not united forces; heck, in the <span class="caps">USA,</span> The Nation of Islam and Islam as practiced by immigrants from the Third World lands of &ldquo;the prophets&rdquo; followers are not united by any stretch of the imagination. The Nation of Islam is more about interpreting black racial grievances through a radically nonstandard version of  Islam, for obviously political reasons. It is viewed by most followers of non-radical Islam as an embarrassing sideshow of freaks; and by radicalized Islam, as a sideshow of exploitable and profitable freaks.</p>
<p>With Christian American blacks it is something your son or daughter may join while in prison to be in a sanctioned gang, but discouraged at once upon release. With the largely Catholic Hispanic &ldquo;community,&rdquo; who knows? But my best guess is, it will never be more than minuscule fad among the most disaffected and deranged of their number, whether incarcerated or otherwise? Moreover, as the now tangible animosity between Hispanics and blacks grow in this country, a fringe anomaly of the black &ldquo;community&rdquo; will become even less appealing to their Hispanic antagonists.</p>
<p>Or put another way, only the creation of a race of translucent devils by one of Dr. Yakub&rsquo;s evil descendents, brought into being to combat us white devils of his ancestor&rsquo;s creation, could bring about unity among the &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; entitlement combatants.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

					<p>How can Farrakhan led blacks away from oppressive white culture, where they can realize their full potential? Have a million man <span class="caps">PLUS </span>march to Washington and demand one way transportation to Africa, that way they can finally be free at last. If the federal government won&rsquo;t pay he can ask the public for donations, I&rsquo;d bet he&rsquo;d have <span class="caps">MORE </span>than enough money before the sun went down.</p>

					<p>Farrakhan is being contradictory.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he says that black men should take personal responsibility for themselves and their community.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he says that the big bad evil white system was out to get <span class="caps">T.I. </span>and Michael Vick.</p>

					<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Louis Farrakhan become the new Marcus Garvey? With the indisputably higher IQ of American Africans, they should <span class="caps">EASILY </span>become the cognitive elite of Africa. I say, Rhodesia ought to let in American Africans to take over the positions they drove the whites from; let an African nation <span class="caps">BLOOM </span>with the promises American African leadership claims: that since whitey has kept the black man down for 452 years, throwing off the chains of white society would be a Godsend.</p>
<p>Go for it, &#8220;Calypso&#8221; Louis!</p>

<p>&gt; Interesting comment - and since there were blacks in the south who owned slaves will they look them up and make their descendants pay?</p>
<p>But of course the entire idea of reparations is ridiculous.  Let them pound sand.  The white race has paid and paid in blood and treasure for at least 150 years. </p>

					<p>&#8220;we accepted 12 years ago the responsibility to become better fathers, better husbands&#8221;,,,,,</p>
<p>  Oh really? Has there been a drop in the black illegitimacy rate? Is there any statistical evidence to back this up? All the black males I have to work with have packs of illegitimate kids from various women. They are virtually indifferent to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;White kids account for 80% of the purchases of rap and hip-hop&#8221;</p>
<p> I have always thought this was a canard. How do they know this? Do they have a guy stand outside every store in the malls and count off every guy who buys a CD and what kind of music it is? This reminds me of the &#8220;statistic&#8221; in the 1980&rsquo;s that 40 million Americans went jogging every morning. What did they do? Have a guy on every street corner in the country counting joggers going by. Given all the boot-leg sales of <span class="caps">CD&rsquo;</span>s I have seen from blacks with my own eyes I don&rsquo;t think any stated sales figures are believeable.  </p>
<p>  &#8220;Recruiting Blacks to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan&#8221;</p>
<p> Actually the most disproportionate number of casualties have been among Whites.</p>
<p> Still the whole show is typical of blacks. All style, no substance. </p>

					<p>I know this is trivial detail, but I must again take issue with this silly claim that Whites purchase &#8220;80%&#8221; of Rap and Hip-Hop, music.&#8221; This number seems to have taken on a life of its own and everytime I hear it&hellip;it is higher and almost certainly less factual. This Black music on the whole is on a steady, if staggering decline in sales and apparently larger popularity overall(though it is still peddled by the usual suspects mercilessly) - and clearly it is Blacks who cling to this Ghetto noise, much more than misguided, young Whites. </p>
<p>This idea that Whites are overwhelmingly the prime consumers of this Black Thug-music has always struck me as highly suspicious! Yes, they do listen to it - much more than any of us might even wish to imagine - but still this never sounded entirely realistic. It sounds to me a whole lot more like still another way to glorify and &#8220;mainstream&#8221; Black/ghetto culture and Blacks in general&hellip;and in that respect it has been phenomenally successful. But, I sincerely doubt that Whites, especially today, are the chief consumers of this nonsense either way.     </p>

					<p>Farrakhan is about as black as I am. He is nothing more than a mulatto who hates himself. (I don&rsquo;t blame him.) And I urge others here to check out the website of the Jewish Task Force and read the article on the origins of the Nation of Islam, which was founded by a white lunatic and has been maintained by every kind of weirdo imaginable. (I am not posting a link because I do not know if AmRen will allow that.) It is such a ridiculous organization that I could never take it seriously. They are worse than scientologists.</p>

					<p>I wonder if Farrakhan believes that the huge illegal immigrant influx is one of the conspiracies designed to make the black man extinct? </p>

					<p> &ldquo;We accepted 12 years ago the responsibility to be better men, better fathers and better husbands. It was a day never before experienced in our history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RK:  And it did absolutely no good at all.  In fact black males performed worse and committed more crime at greater rates since then, and, as a whole, evidenced not one iota of responsibility, so the mass gathering was a complete and total failure.</p>
<p>This character comes up with some of the most idiotic statements a person has to wonder if he&rsquo;s playing with a full deck or is just the usual low <span class="caps">I.Q. </span>black male.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering who is going to take his place.  Marion Barry might be a good substitute, but he&rsquo;s getting up in years himself.  They&rsquo;re quite similar though.  He&rsquo;s the ex-mayor of <span class="caps">D.C. </span>who said &#8220;All laws are racist.  Even the law of gravity is racist!&#8221;  Sounds like he&rsquo;s right in step with Calypso Louie, doesn&rsquo;t it?<br>

					<p>The more I read his statements the more humor I see in him, I&rsquo;m sorry Master Farrakan, you are a clown. I often visit the <span class="caps">N.O.I. </span>website get some great laughs there.</p>

					<p>Perhaps if this geek, as well as Al and Jesse, stopped getting media coverage, they&rsquo;d just fade away, mumbling &#8220;it&rsquo;s all  whitey&rsquo;s fault. They&rsquo;re akin to Vicente Fox, who&rsquo;s just done a tour of the <span class="caps">U.S </span>(hopefully his last), who blames the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>for his country&rsquo;s failed economy and the reason that his people <span class="caps">HAVE </span>to invade us. Will these people ever  get a life and own up to their own failures? They would rather whine, demand, threaten and blame anyone else than get a little pride and help themselves and their own people. </p>

<i>&ldquo;But black males, in particular, are endangered.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is a very common refrain among blacks today. I hear blacks say it on their talk shows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a subtle way for blacks to say &#8216;we are the source of our problems&rsquo; without saying so directly.</p>
<p>Blacks know they cause their own problems but to say so would let the White man off the hook; and as long as the White man can be made to feel responsible for blacks dysfunction, the money keeps flowing.</p>

					<p>Louis Farrakhan&hellip;Robert Mugabe&hellip;separated at birth? You be the judge, our lines are open!</p>
<p>Seriously, Farrakhan IS America&rsquo;s version of Mugabe, and G-d help us if he ever attains real power.</p>
<p>And speaking of Mugabe, I just had a thought: Maybe we could get him to go hunting with Dick Cheney.</p>

					<p>You know that Farrakhan won&rsquo;t be sensored [BEFORE <span class="caps">POSTING ANYTHING FURTHER</span> ON <span class="caps">THIS SITE, KINDLY LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN </span>&#8220;CENSURED,&#8221; &#8220;CENSORED,&#8221; AND &#8220;SENSORED&#8221; (THE <span class="caps">LATTER</span> OF <span class="caps">WHICH</span> IS <span class="caps">NOT</span> A <span class="caps">WORD</span> AT <span class="caps">ALL.</span>] for this &#8220;truth speech&#8221; the way Watson was&hellip;.  Look at how they cornered that old man until he cried &#8220;uncle.&#8221;  Now, he is denouncing his own comments!</p>
<p>That is how they do it.  Isolated and alone, they can wring a &#8220;confession&#8221; and self denouncement from anyone.  It reminds me of that Twighlight Zone episode when a man is condemned as obsolete because of his out of the &#8220;accepted norm&#8221; thoughts and speech.  In a free society, he comments should have been debated, not silenced.  If they can use facts and logic to show his claims were untrue, we would have all learned the lesson.  Instead, they only say that his comments were &#8220;out of the realm of dissussion!&#8221;</p>

					<p>Vick is responsible for himself, Obama is half-white, and voter ID laws do not deprive anyone of the right to vote. Such laws may make voting inconvenient for some, but these same folks can make it all the way out to Jena, LA from GA to protest blacks&rsquo;being punished rightfully(indeed, too leniently).</p>

					<p>Say what you want about Farrakhan, but at least he speaks his mind and says what he believes regardless of what anyone else thinks. I have respect for people like that. I don&rsquo;t agree with a lot of what he says about White people, and he has said a lot of outrageous things (claiming to be abducted by aliens, claiming that the levees in New Orleans were blown up), but he is right about a lot of things, and his message for Black people to improve themselves instead of blaming racism for everything is a good one, and one that more Blacks should listen to. I certainly respect Farrakhan more then I do people like Jackson or Sharpton. </p>

					<p>This guy is lucky blacks as a group have low intelligence, because if they were just the white average they would be embarrassed at his mindless, unintelligent ramblings that make him appear to be retarded and would ignore him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read such stupid statements from any other leader in my life.  He would make a great poster boy for the people who believe in setting up a colony on the moon.</p>

If you knew how much pain and agony Mr. F&rsquo;s followers have brought into my life simply because I have blue eyes, (i.e. I am the &#8216;blue-eyed devil&rsquo; to his followers) then maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to respect him.

					<p>Considering that his followers are mostly recruited from felons serving state prison sentences, I can see that he would be discouraged.</p>
<p>I wonder why normal, non criminal blacks never join the <span class="caps">NOI</span>?  It is certainly not for lack of missionary activity on <span class="caps">NOI&rsquo;</span>s part.  Could it be that normal blacks are a bit nervous about joining a religion of state prison parolees?</p>
<p>I sure would be if I were black.</p>

					<p>Whites acting like Whiggers is dying fast.  Wasn&rsquo;t there an article posted here about the music industry telling rap &#8220;stars&#8221; to shut-up, because their style and lyrics are not selling as they once did?  I&rsquo;ve seen less and less Blacks hanging with White girls, too. It was the trend or fashion for Whitey to hang with the Black boy but Whites are backpedaling.  And not just because Mom and Dad don&rsquo;t like it; they now are seeing for themselves the ginormous differences between our cultures.  Teens are discerning for themselves that they are comfortable with their own kind.  </p>

					<p>I <span class="caps">LIKE</span> Louis Farrakhan. I enjoy his speeches, I like his ideology, I appreciate what he&rsquo;s trying to do. I wish more blacks would follow his example, you see, I don&rsquo;t want blacks in my neighborhood anymore than Louie wants YT in his. </p>
<p>If we can get blacks to jump on the separatist bandwagon, that means we get our separation as well. At that tipping point, we&rsquo;ll only have to deal with blacks in government controlled settings, and that ain&rsquo;t me having a cup of coffee in a mixed break room.</p>

					<p>Last Sunday, enroute from visiting the family, I stopped off at MacDonalds.  Whilst in the queue, I found myself standing alongside a local white teenage girl with her arms wrapped round an Asian lad of the Indian/Pakistani variety.  </p>
<p>Well, I stood there fuming and stared at both of them with a look that could kill.  </p>
<p>The white female then put her arms around his neck and started kissing him on the lips.  I coughed aloud and gave them another extremely disapproving look full of pure anger.  </p>
<p>He must have picked up on it because he unwrapped her arms and gave her a look of rebuff.  She reacted with embarrassment and recoiled with a hurt look on her face.</p>
<p>It proved that merely casting highly disapproving glances seems to work, at least where Asians are concerned perhaps.<br>
