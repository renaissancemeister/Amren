						<p>A sweeping City Hall corruption probe that has produced federal charges against a dozen black civic and political leaders is renewing suspicions of racism in a city with a long history of combative minority relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes Dallas looks bad,&#8221; said Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins, who is black, &#8220;because people just have the general sense of the city being unfair to people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sixteen people &mdash; 12 of them black &mdash; were named in corruption indictments unsealed this week. Most of them were charged in what the FBI said was a kickback and bribery scheme involving the awarding of contracts to white developers to build affordable housing, mostly in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The two-year investigation &mdash; and the spectacle of some of Dallas&rsquo; most influential black leaders arriving at the federal courthouse to face charges &mdash; dealt a blow to a minority community still struggling to find its political footing.</p>
<p>Some blacks said they suspect the case is an attempt to dismantle Dallas&rsquo; black political leadership.</p>
<p>Among the blacks indicted are a former City Council member, a former city planner, businessmen, state Rep. Terri Hodge of Dallas, and former Mayor Pro Tem Don Hill, who was considered a front-runner for mayor in June but was hurt by the investigation. He was defeated in the first round of elections. Four white developers were also charged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The scandal threatens to reopen old racial wounds in a city less than 20 years removed from a federal civil rights lawsuit that forced it to revamp its government structure. Before the change, minorities had complained it was too difficult to win seats on the City Council. Four blacks now serve on the 15-member council.</p>
<p>More recently, the 2003 firing of the city&rsquo;s first black police chief, Terrell Bolton, led protesters to march to City Hall and shut down a City Council meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Watkins said that the perception of racial bias in Dallas is warranted given the history of its criminal justice system. Watkins said those guilty of the crimes should be punished. &#8220;But the question becomes, well, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you use the same standard for those involved that were there before?&#8221;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price, who is black, said the fact that three-fourths of those indicted are black doesn&rsquo;t give him reason for pause. &#8220;Unfortunately, all the actors who were in a position to make a decision .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were black,&#8221; he said.</p>

					<p>whenever black assume position of power and public trust they abuse it; this holds true for evey black run city in the country.  And whenever anyone takes the trouble to investigate the corruption, the replay is always the same, cries of racism.  If a black official takes bribes totalling millions of dollars somehow that is never a crime and when caught the excuse is always racism.  Racism is the blacks&rsquo; answer to everything.  Only an imbicile would believe it, but the cities&rsquo; black constituents always do.  It just gets somewhat old after a while.</p>

					<p><i>&ldquo;It makes Dallas looks bad,&rdquo; said Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins, who is black.</i><br>
As usual, always avoiding the blame.</p>
<p><i>Some blacks said they suspect the case is an attempt to dismantle Dallas&rsquo; black political leadership.</i><br>
Wow. If whites wanted to dismantle black leadership, why don&rsquo;t they just use pure muscle? That would be easier instead of all these elaborate schemes.</p>

					<p> At the risk of sounding like I&rsquo;m obsessed by this topic, let me say once again: It&rsquo;s an Associated Press article with a racial angle, so White nationalists should examine it with extreme skepticism.<br>
 For instance, with the exception of one sentence from a White <span class="caps">U.S. </span>attorney   &mdash;   one very innocuous sentence which doesn&rsquo;t really answer anyone&rsquo;s charges   &mdash;   all the other direct quotes are from blacks. Not one White person is interviewed saying something like, &#8220;These guys all have a vested interest in screaming &#8216;Racism! Bigotry!&rsquo; &#8221; (or words to that effect). Suggestions by black spokesmen that &#8220;they&#8221; (the white establishment, presumably) want to &#8220;dismantle the black leadership&#8221; are quoted, then left to hang there, unanswered.<br><br>
 And the final sentence is a quote from a black &#8220;political analyst&#8221; that &#8220;Our progress here is cosmetic.&#8221; No explanation of what that&rsquo;s supposed to mean (the reporter didn&rsquo;t ask him; why spoil a good quote?) And no attempt to get a rebuttal from anyone who believes blacks have made real progress in the city. No quote from a black that believes that, even, let alone a (yuk!) White!    </p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.  I saw this article a few days ago on msnbc.com and couldn&rsquo;t believe that this was being made into a racial issue.  After the Jena incident, expect blacks to make every prosecution of criminal behavior a race issue.  If you do the crime you should suffer the consequences.  Why is this so hard for blacks to understand?</p>

					<p>This could happen in any large city in America, set up an <span class="caps">FBI </span>sting operation and you would get the same results, the ones caught, are the most stupid and unable to cover their tracks, the same thing took place in Tennessee not long ago and the results were the same, nearly all perps were black.</p>

					<p>My local &#8220;black chamber of commerce&#8221; is one of the most corrupt in the country. It is so bad I doubt even AmReners would believe much of what has gone on here. One of its members used public money to pay for barbecue and music for his own parties and to take trips to the Caribbean. Another used huge amounts of money to build herself a big mansion in which she used to have drug and alcohol orgies with young blacks and white lesbians. And when anyone complained you can bet they all cried racism, and the stupid whites around here let it slide.</p>

					<p>Atlanta&rsquo;s ex-mayor, Bill Campbell, who&rsquo;s black, snivelled that he was a victim of &#8220;racism&#8221; when he was found guilty of simialr charges and sentenced to prison. I believe he&rsquo;s doing time now. <br>
An E. GA politician made the same fuss because he&rsquo;s black and was found guilty of something, I forget what. Of course, when a white male GA politician was found guilt of whatever, that was <span class="caps">OK.</span> Also, when 2 black guys and a white guy who were Atlanta airport officials were tried for multiple offenses, 1 black guy was acquitted of all but the other 2 found guilty. The blacks still hollered &#8220;racism!&#8221; even though a white was found guilty and 1 black not found guilty.</p>
<p>For the record, when <span class="caps">GA&rsquo;</span>s ex-school superintendent, Linda Screnko, a white woman, was charged with many offenses (and found guilty), her white male attorney claimed she was a victim of sexism. I have no more use for Schrenko&rsquo;s snivelling than I do a black&rsquo;s, although I&rsquo;m a <span class="caps">WASP </span>female, too.</p>

					<p>It is always race is it not?  In Fort Worth Texas this week, a black store clerk named Ricky Young slammed a White customer at his check out stand with a heavy metal tool.</p>
<p>The customer went home and called police.  When the police arrived, Ricky said &#8220;he disrespected me by calling me a racial slur.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police answered.  He is deaf and cannot speak.  How could he possibly have called you a racial slur?</p>
<p>Ricky, well I thought I heard a racial slur so I was justified in hitting him.</p>
<p>That is the standard defense against all black on White crime.  He or she called me a n****r therefore I am justified in robbing, beating or murdering that white victim.  </p>
<p>And government prosecutors then proceed to send the victim of the beating, rape or robbery off to a lengthy term in prison for the crime of being accused of using the n word by a career criminal.</p>

					<p>This is why I advocate voting for African-Americans at all levels in the city of Chicago. In order to rid ourselves of the anti-gun Mayor Richard M. Daley, we must destroy the government by raising taxes to unheard of levels. The African-American voters consider taxes as something white people pay, and that they are the beneficiaries of government largess. Combined with the internal moral compass that blacks practice (only 57% are apparently honest), voting blacks into office means the inevitable collapes of government. So I say, <span class="caps">VOTE BLACK, </span>and sit back while &#8220;Blacks do their <span class="caps">THANG</span>!&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;People of color&#8221;?  If you remember your basic science, black is the absence of any light or color. White is the combination of all colors of the color spectrum.  So black people are not only without common sense and ethics, they haven&rsquo;t any color either!  That is why they refer to themselves as colored!  Always misdirecting the issues in an attempt to avoid the truth and if you tell yourself something long enough, you will start to believe it! Crime, freeloading, whining, rioting, bellyaching, breeding, more crime and the sentence repeats its self.  Arn&rsquo;t they an asset to the planet?</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m sure the comedy team of Jackson/Sharpton will have a march, raise millions, stutter their way around the TV talk shows and find out these people did nothing wrong at all. The long investigation, the proof,and the reality will all be because of discrimination. Isn&rsquo;t that the lingo they learn early? They can talk nonsense, but if they throw in a few remarks with the words: racist, discrimination, dissin&rsquo; me, they can rationalize their own failures. A half-century after integration, they sit side by side with white students and still blame any failure on whitey, the school system, the teachers, etc. I would not be surprised to come back in 100 years and hear the same old, same old.</p>

					<p>Is this one of the typical characteristics of black people?I came from South Africa living in Canada now.We delt with this characteristic of black people in South Africa on a daily basis.It is not new to me.That is the reason why you can not live in one country with black people and share everything with them,they will destroy you with their behaviour.In south Africa we use to say that you can get the blacks out of Africa but you can not get there African behaviour out of them.Even when they are in the <span class="caps">USA </span>for hundreds of years.</p>
