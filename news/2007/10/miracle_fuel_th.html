<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article2748936.ece">&lsquo;Miracle&rsquo; Fuel That Made a Mockery of Mugabe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jan Raath, London Times, October 27, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Nomatter Tagarira, a spirit medium, claimed that she could conjure refined diesel out of a rock by striking it with her staff, ministers in Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s Government believed that they might have found the solution to Zimbabwe&rsquo;s perennial fuel shortage.</p>
<p>After witnessing her apparently miraculous gift they gave her five billion Zimbabwean dollars in cash (worth Â£1.7 million at the start of the year but now worth one seven-hundredth of that) in return for the fuel. Ms Tagarira was also given a farm, said to have been seized from its white owner during Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s lawless land grab, as well as food and services that included a round-the-clock armed guard on the rock in the district of Chinhoyi 60 miles (100km) from Harare, the capital.</p>
<p>More than a year later officials realised they had been duped. Ms Tagarira is now in custody, awaiting trial on charges of fraud or, alternatively, of being &#8220;a criminal nuisance&#8221;. Details from court papers published this week said that over 15 months, until July this year, Ms Tagarira convinced Cabinet ministers, ruling party heavy-weights and top army and police officers that by striking the rock with her staff she could produce enough fuel to supply the country for 100 years.</p>
<p>The legal firm representing her told The Times that she had been refused bail and no trial date had been set yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an outlandish story but the people in government who believed this are the same ones who believe that Mugabe&rsquo;s official policy of printing money will end inflation,&#8221; said an economist, who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>After 27 years of economic misrule, what was once one of Africa&rsquo;s most prosperous countries is in a nightmare of hyperinflation, famine and infra-structural collapse.</p>
<p>According to the police docket at the court, Ms Tagarira, 35, discovered a large bowser of diesel last year, suspected to have been abandoned in the hills of Chinhoyi during the country&rsquo;s civil war in the 1970s.</p>
<p>She laid pipes from the bowser to a point at the bottom of the hill. Whenever she assembled an audience, she would strike a rock and an assistant at the top of the hill would open the tap and lo, fuel would pour out. The bowser eventually ran dry but that didn&rsquo;t stop Ms Tagarira. &#8220;They would buy diesel from lorry drivers and keep it in the pipe on the pretext it was coming from a rock,&#8221; the docket said.</p>
<p>By June the Government had decided the claims were plausible enough to warrant an official investigation. However, where a single geologist would have sufficed, they dispatched a large &#8220;task force&#8221; of politicians and members of the security forces, led by the deputy commissioner of police.</p>
<p>The task force duly reported to Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s politburo, the most powerful body in the country, that the liquid appearing at the rock had been siphoned into lorries and that they had driven off without problem.</p>
<p>However, it was when a second &#8220;task force&#8221; of ministers was sent by the politburo a month later that Ms Tagarira&rsquo;s ruse ended. She &#8220;failed to prove the existence of the fuel&#8221;, it said. She disappeared and was arrested this month. &#8220;It is not the woman who ought to be arrested, it is the idiots who authorised this criminal waste of public money,&#8221; said a lawyer, asking not to be named.</p>
