<h1><a href="https://thefire.org/index.php/article/8555.html">Press Release: University of Delaware Requires Students to Undergo Ideological Reeducation</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), October 30, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The University of Delaware subjects students in its residence halls to a shocking program of ideological reeducation that is referred to in the university&rsquo;s own materials as a &#8220;treatment&#8221; for students&rsquo; incorrect attitudes and beliefs. The Orwellian program requires the approximately 7,000 students in Delaware&rsquo;s residence halls to adopt highly specific university-approved views on issues ranging from politics to race, sexuality, sociology, moral philosophy, and environmentalism. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) is calling for the total dismantling of the program, which is a flagrant violation of students&rsquo; rights to freedom of conscience and freedom from compelled speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;The University of Delaware&rsquo;s residence life education program is a grave intrusion into students&rsquo; private beliefs,&#8221; FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said. &#8220;The university has decided that it is not enough to expose its students to the values it considers important; instead, it must coerce its students into accepting those values as their own. At a public university like Delaware, this is both unconscionable and unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s views are forced on students through a comprehensive manipulation of the residence hall environment, from mandatory training sessions to &#8220;sustainability&#8221; door decorations. Students living in the university&rsquo;s eight housing complexes are required to attend training sessions, floor meetings, and one-on-one meetings with their Resident Assistants (RAs). The RAs who facilitate these meetings have received their own intensive training from the university, including a &#8220;diversity facilitation training&#8221; session at which RAs were taught, among other things, that &#8220;[a] racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist (racist) system. The term applies to all white people (i.e., people of European descent) living in the United States, regardless of class, gender, religion, culture or sexuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The university suggests that at one-on-one sessions with students, RAs should ask intrusive personal questions such as &#8220;When did you discover your sexual identity?&#8221; Students who express discomfort with this type of questioning often meet with disapproval from their RAs, who write reports on these one-on-one sessions and deliver these reports to their superiors. One student identified in a write-up as an RA&rsquo;s &#8220;worst&#8221; one-on-one session was a young woman who stated that she was tired of having &#8220;diversity shoved down her throat.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the program&rsquo;s materials, the goal of the residence life education program is for students in the university&rsquo;s residence halls to achieve certain &#8220;competencies&#8221; that the university has decreed its students must develop in order to achieve the overall educational goal of &#8220;citizenship.&#8221; These competencies include: &#8220;Students will recognize that systemic oppression exists in our society,&#8221; &#8220;Students will recognize the benefits of dismantling systems of oppression,&#8221; and &#8220;Students will be able to utilize their knowledge of sustainability to change their daily habits and consumer mentality.&#8221;</p>
<p>At various points in the program, students are also pressured or even required to take actions that outwardly indicate their agreement with the university&rsquo;s ideology, regardless of their personal beliefs. Such actions include displaying specific door decorations, committing to reduce their ecological footprint by at least 20%, taking action by advocating for an &#8220;oppressed&#8221; social group, and taking action by advocating for a &#8220;sustainable world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Office of Residence Life&rsquo;s internal materials, these programs are described using the harrowing language of ideological reeducation. In documents relating to the assessment of student learning, for example, the residence hall lesson plans are referred to as &#8220;treatments.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a letter sent yesterday to University of Delaware President Patrick Harker, FIRE pointed out the stark contradiction between the residence life education program and the values of a free society. FIRE&rsquo;s letter to President Harker also underscored the University of Delaware&rsquo;s legal obligation to abide by the First Amendment. FIRE reminded Harker of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <cite>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</cite> (1943), a case decided during World War II that remains the law of the land. Justice Robert H. Jackson, writing for the Court, declared, &#8220;If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the university views its students as patients in need of treatment for some sort of moral sickness betrays a total lack of respect not only for students&rsquo; basic rights, but for students themselves,&#8221; Lukianoff said. &#8220;The University of Delaware has both a legal and a moral obligation to immediately dismantle this program, and FIRE will not rest until it has.&#8221;</p>
<p>FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights, due process rights, freedom of expression, and rights of conscience on our campuses. FIRE would like to thank the Delaware Association of Scholars (DAS) for its invaluable assistance in this case.

															<h2><a href="https://thefire.org/index.php/article/8552.html">Excerpts From University Of Delaware Office Of Residence Life Diversity Facilitation Training</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education), October 30, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>Excerpts are taken from from the University of Delaware Office of Residence Life Diversity Facilitation Training document, linked in PDF form below.</p>
<p> &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>&#8220;A RACIST: A racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist (racist) system. The term applies to all white people (i.e., people of European descent) living in the United States, regardless of class, gender, religion, culture or sexuality. By this definition, people of color cannot be racists, because as peoples within the U.S. system, they do not have the power to back up their prejudices, hostilities, or acts of discrimination. (This does not deny the existence of such prejudices, hostilities, acts of rage or discrimination.)&#8221; &mdash; Page 3</p>
<p> &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>&#8220;REVERSE RACISM: A term created and used by white people to deny their white privilege. Those in denial use the term reverse racism to refer to hostile behavior by people of color toward whites, and to affirmative action policies, which allegedly give &lsquo;preferential treatment&rsquo; to people of color over whites. In the U.S., there is no such thing as &lsquo;reverse racism.&rsquo;&#8221; &mdash; Page 3</p>
<p> &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>&#8220;A NON-RACIST: A non-term. The term was created by whites to deny responsibility for systemic racism, to maintain an aura of innocence in the face of racial oppression, and to shift responsibility for that oppression from whites to people of color (called &#8220;blaming the victim&#8221;). Responsibility for perpetuating and legitimizing a racist system rests both on those who actively maintain it, and on those who refuse to challenge it. Silence is consent.&#8221; &mdash; Page 3</p>
<p> &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard a well-meaning white person say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a member of any race except the human race?&rsquo; What she usually means by this statement is that she doesn&rsquo;t want to perpetuate racial categories by acknowledging that she is white. This is an evasion of responsibility for her participation in a system based on supremacy for white people.&#8221; &mdash; Page 8</p>
<p> &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>&#8220;The notion of indigenous people as more akin to animals than human beings is at the basis of U.S. policy toward Native Americans. In 1784 George Washington, famous Indian fighter, large landholder and slave owner, advised the Continental Congress that it would be cheaper for the new nation to buy up Indian land than to make war on Indian people for the land. If you make war, Washington cautioned, &lsquo;the savage as the wolf&rsquo; &mdash; both wild beasts of the forest &mdash; will retreat for awhile and then come back to attack you. Washington&rsquo;s metaphor stuck. The young U.S. nation-state, and all sectors of European- American; began to view the Native American as a wild animal.&#8221; &mdash; Page 10</p>
