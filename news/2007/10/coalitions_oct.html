<p><b>Administrative Reform</b></p>
<p>1. We demand more advisors and counselors for cultural groups, students of color, the LGBTQ community and communities of faith, with student involvement in the hiring process of said personnel. We ask that the Office of Multicultural Affairs be expanded physically and responsibly, and that more support for collaboration between the Office of Multicultural Affairs at Columbia and the Multicultural Affairs Office at Barnard be given by the University administration.</p>
<p>2. We demand a Vice Provost for Multicultural Affairs to administrator and direct the University&rsquo;s policies affecting students within all the schools of the University.</p>
<p>3. We demand that Columbia&rsquo;s Public Safety announce instances of hate crimes when they are reported and issue and an annual report of reported bias incidents and hate crimes and how they have been addressed.</p>
<p>4. We demand that Columbia&rsquo;s Public Safety announce instances of hate crimes when they are reported and issue an annual report of reported bias incidents and hate crimes and how they have been addressed.</p>
<p><b>Ethnic Studies</b></p>
<p>1. Given the inadequate number of core faculty present next semester, we demand the completion of 2 core faculty hires per year for both CSER and IRAAS until each has 12 core junior and senior professors, which must be maintained indefinitely.</p>
<p>2. The academic review of CSER and IRAAS must begin in Summer 2008 where the board must include only ethnic studies scholars from outside institutions as well as Columbia ethnic studies majors. The academic review must also research the steps necessary for the creation of Queer Studies, which has historically been placed under Ethnic Studies at other institutions, as well as Native American Studies which must be considered by the university following the review&rsquo;s completion.</p>
<p>3. Interested Ethnic Studies majors collectively, show through a vote, must be give 1 or 2 votes (depending on committee size) which will be delivered by the current student positions on all hiring committees for junior and senior faculty to increase student presence and determination of CSER&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>4. To maintain the integrity of Ethnic Studies and the very possibility of its sustained growth, the CSER and IRAAS must be granted the ability to make hires autonomously. This is not a call of the immediate departmentalization of Ethnic Studies. Rather it is a call for the Ethnic Studies programs to make hiring decision on their own accord, without the need of outside departments to lead the hire. We recognize that this is unprecedented for centers and institutes throughout the University, but see it as a necessary step in creating Ethnic Studies classes and research initiatives that are accountable to the field and on par with peer institutions.</p>
<p><b>The Manhattanville Expansion and Community Accountability</b></p>
<p>1. Columbia withdraw its 197-C proposal to rezone Manhattanville immediately.</p>
<p>2. After withdrawing its proposal from the review process, Columbia submit its proposal to Community Board 9 for revision in line with the principles of the 197-a plan.</p>
<p>3. After making the relevant changes to its rezoning plan, Columbia negotiate a substantive community benefits agreement which serves to mitigate displacement created by the university&rsquo;s presence and addresses job creation, environmental problems and university-community relations.</p>
<p><b>The Core Curriculum</b></p>
<p>1. The reformation of the Major Cultures requirement to contain a course in a seminar format which challenges students to think critically about the issues of racialization and colonialism, global phenomena which also are at the Core of the &#8220;western&#8221; experience.</p>
<p>2. More student voice and seats within these committees, and that their process of selection be better publicized, so that students&rsquo; passions for changing the Core do not have to flare up in moments of spectacle, but can be incorporated into the constant process of developing the Core Curriculum.</p>

They&rsquo;re always free to start their own institution and teach what they want. But as with all minorities, they&rsquo;d rather destroy what others have built than build anything on their own.</p>

					<p>I guess this is not the kind of hate crime they are talking about at Columbia:</p>
<p>&#8220;On April 13 in New York City, a black man allegedly raped, sodomized, tortured (&#8220;with scalding water and chemicals&#8221; and by slitting her eyelids), and sought to burn to death a Columbia University Journalism School student. The April 16 New York Daily News story on the 19-hour-long attack, Pervert tried to kill her, suppressed the fact that the female victim was white &mdash; obviously endangering white women&rsquo;s lives.&#8221;</p>

					<p>This bunch of marxists should try making demands in any marxist country, like North Korea, China, Cuba or Iran, and see what happens.<br>
Instead of soft, warm, loving media coverage they will get jail then no one will ever see them again.</p>

					<p>These lefto &#8220;student&#8221; morons must be real gluttons for punishment. If they really want to enjoy the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of multi-racialism, all they need to do is stroll through Harlem some night!</p>

					<p>5:39 poster. They won&rsquo;t call is &#8220;QUEER <span class="caps">STUDIES</span>&#8221; for your transcript or attendance. They are far too clever. It will be called something like: &#8220;Comprehensive Graduate Level Advanced Academic World History&#8221;</p>
<p>This is all a job-creation gimmick. This is why the &#8220;professors&#8221; will love it, especially those of color. It gives them a job after have been given a diploma under Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Just think of all the Blacks who can now go to college under Affimative Action, (paid for by the white man&rsquo;s taxes), get free tutors and special testing, graduate and then get a $65,000 to $250,000 at one of these disgusting Universities.</p>
<p>They will have a job for life since it is impossible to fire a person of color, especially in a field as warped and stupid as &#8220;Ethnic Studies&#8221; since there is nothing there to fail at.</p>
<p>This is going to continue and grow. Where else are all these &#8220;ethinc studies&#8221; affirmative action students going to get a job? The government is packed with them and they keep on coming. At least with a University job they wouldn&rsquo;t have to do anything. Teaching &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; has got to be the easiest job in the world. Just make up what you want and blame the white man.</p>
<p>I guess that is the perfect job for the (people of) coloreds.</p>

					<p>&#8220;We demand&#8221; reminds me of the puerile bumper sticker one commonly sees, &#8220;Free Tibet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Free Tibet or else what?  Or else some overgrown adolescent is going to put another bumper sticker on his car?</p>
<p>What are these Columbia students going to do when their demands are ignored?  Drop out and enroll at the University of Delaware?<br>

					<p>On October 31, a swatstika was drawn on the door of a professor at Columbia.  It was all over the news including Drudge report.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the noose hung on the black professor&rsquo;s door?  Columbia should close down and send all its profs and students to a mental health facility.</p>

					<p>Having been taught White&rsquo;s are evil from birth, the students follow the pack in pushing for the marginalization of White people.  I think such perversion will reach a sustained &#8220;high tide&#8221; if we do not stop such institutions from going against our wishes.</p>

<p>I did something like that when I was in college.  I wrote term papers for money.  I made up all sorts of insane drivel and the profs loved it.  The feminazis were the most gullible.<br>

					<p>&#8220;Hate crime&#8221; is a redundant, ridiculous phrase. Furthermore, blacks are far more likely to victimize whites than vice versa. </p>

					<p>Mea culpa, 8:41 <span class="caps">PM. </span> As an undergrad, I wrote termpapers for money as well.  I still have some of Stalin and Lenin&rsquo;s writing, and some translated Mao.  I used their style as a model, so my writing could be shrill enough, in a classical Marxist sense.</p>
<p>One Aztlanista professor of social psychology never clicked to the fact that I was mocking her.  She thought I was merely a neo-Trotskyite.<br>

					<p>The fact that the moniker of &#8220;hate crime&#8221; cannot be applied to a crime involving people of the same race, religion, etc. invalidates its legitimacy and exposes it for the minority empowering communist social stratagem it really is.  The constitution defines this judicial tyranny as &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishment&rdquo;, therefore rendering it unlawful.  It is time we research this newly hatched asinine phrase, expose and punish its originators, and prosecute those who use it as a weapon against whites&hellip;    </p>
