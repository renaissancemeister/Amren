<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The thousands of shipwrecks off Devon and Cornwell are a tragic legacy of this formidable coastline.</p>
<p>But did the treacherous sea once save a village from a fate worse than death? Dan goes to find out.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the remains of a mysterious ship were discovered just off Salcombe in Devon, along with a huge hoard of treasure. This treasure links the ship to a time, 400 years ago, when people were taken from villages all along the south coast of Britain &mdash; to be sold into slavery.</p>
<p>The treasure is now kept at the British Museum and looked after by curator, Venetia Porter. &#8220;It includes over 400 gold coins &mdash; two dated the 17th century, which allows us to date the wreck,&#8221; Venetia tells Dan, &#8220;It&rsquo;s from Morocco, so to find something like this on the seabed off the coast of Devon is pretty remarkable.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the question is, what was it doing off the coast of Devon? Dan heads to Salcombe to find out.</p>
<p>Salcombe today is a peaceful holiday town, but it was very different picture 400 years ago. Back then, pirates from North Africa&rsquo;s Barbary Coast were making daring raids all along Britain&rsquo;s southern shores &mdash; and they weren&rsquo;t just stealing loot.</p>
<p>Coastal communities like Salcombe lived in fear of the Barbary pirates &mdash; with good reason. In 1631, almost the whole of the village of Baltimore in Ireland was captured and shipped off to Africa and sold into slavery.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the shipwreck in Salcombe once belonged to pirates on the hunt for white slaves? Maritime archaeologist Dave Parham is trying to answer that very question.</p>
<p>He takes Dan on a dive to see what&rsquo;s left of the wreck. On the seabed, where most of the gold has been found, the ship&rsquo;s timbers have rotted away, but its guns remain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in front of us we can see the first group of cannons, and there&rsquo;s another group of four canons with a large anchor between them,&#8221; Dave points out to Dan, &#8220;It would suggest that the vessel that was wrecked here was armed with a number of large guns in the back and a number of large guns in the stern.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the same layout as a pirate galley, with cannons at both ends, and space for slaves to row in the middle. It looks like this is a pirate ship. However, other items found near the wreck, including a merchant seal, pieces of pottery and pewter, suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>The items are not from North Africa, they&rsquo;re Dutch, so it might not be a Barbary pirate ship at all. Instead, it could be a Dutch merchant that was trading with Morocco, or smuggling gold out of North Africa.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one other possibility that fits the pirate theory. According to Dave, &#8220;A lot of European seamen captured by the Barbary pirates became pirates themselves. In fact, the pirate vessel that attacked Baltimore in Ireland was skippered by a Dutchman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So what&rsquo;s your gut feeling?&#8221; Dan asks him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t honestly know, is the answer. I would like it to be a pirate vessel &mdash; but I can&rsquo;t put my hand on my heart and say that,&#8221; Dave admits.</p>
<p>So whether it was a ship carrying Dutch traders &mdash; or Barbary pirates, we might never know for sure.</p>
<p>If it was a pirate ship attempting to raid the south Devon coast, then one thing is certain &mdash; the treacherous waters saved the inhabitants of Salcombe from a life in chains on the Barbary Coast.</p>
