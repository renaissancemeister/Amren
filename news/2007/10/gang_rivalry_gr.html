<p><b>Mexican Mafia strategy</b></p>
<p>For years, the two rival gangs resisted outside pressures to go to war, according to those active in Florencia in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Like many black and Latino gangs, they ignored each other during the worst gang years of the late &lsquo;80s and early &lsquo;90s. Instead, they focused on attacking rivals of their own race.</p>
<p>But during the mid-&rsquo;90s, the Mexican Mafia prison gang began directing Latino gangs to stop fighting each other, to &#8220;tax&#8221; drug dealers and to push blacks from their neighborhoods, according to numerous gang members and law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>Florencia, in particular, had warred for years with 38th Street, a Latino gang to the north.</p>
<p>But under the new rules, Florencia was forced to get along with rival Latino gangs and once even played a pickup football game with 38th Street, said one Florencia gang member who requested anonymity out of fear for his safety.</p>
<p>The Mexican Mafia &#8220;didn&rsquo;t understand how it worked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hate 38th Street. I didn&rsquo;t have no problem with the guys from East Coast because I grew up with them. It&rsquo;s kind of hard to say, &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to&hellip; kill this black guy just because he&rsquo;s black.&rsquo; But that&rsquo;s how they wanted to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1996 tensions erupted when members of a gang associated with East Coast Crips, known as the 6-5 Hustlers, killed a Florencia member.</p>
<p>After some retaliation, the gangs held a peace summit at Parmelee Elementary School one night, and that &#8220;kind of squashed everything,&#8221; the gang member said.</p>
<p>But the fighting resumed when word, perhaps mythical, spread about the East Coast Crips&rsquo; drug rip-off of Florencia 13.</p>
<p>Race, gang rivalry and drugs have become impossibly tangled as motives in killings and assaults in the neighborhood, authorities and residents say. The result: a gangland version of racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just see a young man of the opposite race and they shoot,&#8221; said Olivia Rosales, a former hate-crime prosecutor, who prosecuted all the East Coast-Florencia murder cases for the last two years. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t stop to question whether or not they are a member of the gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the 20 cases she prosecuted, said Rosales, who now runs the district attorney&rsquo;s Whittier office, &#8220;most of the victims have not been members of the rival gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demetrius Perry, 22, was shot to death by Latinos yelling a gang epithet as he played basketball in January at Drew Middle School, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to kick it with&#8221; Latinos, said Perry&rsquo;s father, Benny, who is black and grew up in the area. &#8220;Now you constantly hear about it: This is their land first and they&rsquo;ve come to take it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Timothy Slack, who lives a few blocks from Great Hope Fellowship church, said Latino gang members often drive by shooting at blacks. He doesn&rsquo;t allow his kids to go to the store and he never uses alleys anymore.</p>
<p>Slack grew up in Florence-Firestone when it was mostly black and had few Latinos.</p>
<p>Back then, &#8220;they were timid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But as their numbers started getting bigger, then they started trying to be tougher. They started thinking they could demand stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>But non-gang-affiliated Latinos have also been killed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Economy looking up</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But &#8220;the gang war puts a damper on everything that you do here,&#8221; said Joe Titus, 79, who was born in Florence-Firestone and volunteers with several community organizations. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t want to go out at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fewer people ride bikes; fewer children play outside after school. Movable basketball stanchions, once ubiquitous in driveways, are gone.</p>
<p>Irv Sitkoff, a local pharmacist, said people of one race complain if his employees attend faster to people of the other race.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ve got to very careful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Before, we didn&rsquo;t think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitkoff said his pharmacy has sold grim supplies to customers because of neighborhood violence: more colostomy bags, for example.</p>
<p>One Latino mother bought antidepressant medication from him for many months after her son, an innocent bystander, was killed by a black gang, Sitkoff said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&rsquo;t talk directly about it, but there&rsquo;s fear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How could there not be? I have black families who are the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the exodus continues. More black families depart every year for Palmdale or the Inland Empire. Some cliques of the East Coast Crips in the neighborhood don&rsquo;t exist any more.</p>
<p>One former black gang member said he hasn&rsquo;t left Florence-Firestone because he still has family and property there.</p>
<p>But &#8220;it&rsquo;s going to come a time when everybody&rsquo;s going to have to leave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everybody&rsquo;s going to have to go.&#8221;</p>
