<h1><a href="https://www.philly.com/philly/business/20071016_Noose_incident_at_the_Comcast_site_spurs_a_demonstration.html">Noose Incident at the Comcast Site Spurs a Demonstration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacey Burling, Philadelphia Inquirer, October 16, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A. Bruce Crawley, president of Millennium 3 Management, a public relations firm, and former leader of the African American Chamber of Commerce, said he had previously focused on insisting that skilled-trade unions accept more minority workers. &#8220;We were not aware of the pervasive racial harassment on these work sites,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crawley participated in a demonstration yesterday at the Comcast site that was spurred by at Oct. 1 incident involving Paul Solomon, an African American hoist operator, and a white member of the glaziers&rsquo; union. Solomon said yesterday that the glazier shook a noose at him as he stopped his hoist at the 45th floor. &#8220;He looked me in my eyes and told me he wanted to hang somebody,&#8221; Solomon said. He said the man later tried to say he was joking. Solomon said he viewed the incident as a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case is now &#8220;under review&#8221; by the Philadelphia District Attorney&rsquo;s Office, said spokeswoman Cathie Abookire.</p>
<p>Jeanne Leonard, vice president of investor relations for Liberty Property Trust, which owns the Comcast site, said the glazier was removed from his job at that project that day. {snip}</p>
<p>Crawley said &hellip; the Comcast incident&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp; was &#8220;just the tip of the iceberg. It was symptomatic of a broader issue. You could have had that demonstration anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crawley said he wanted to see a &#8220;top-down commitment to ensuring the quality of the work environment.&#8221; The mayor and governor should be held accountable, he said, and contractors who allow harassment should be fined or barred from work. He also called for the establishment of a construction-industry harassment hotline and for a computerized registry of workers who have engaged in harassment. Such employees would be ineligible for work on any City of Philadelphia work site.</p>
