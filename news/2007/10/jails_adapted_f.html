<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Prison Service has converted two jails to hold only foreign national prisoners, it has been revealed.</p>
<p>Bullwood Hall, Essex, and Canterbury Prison, Kent, have been taking foreign offenders since the 2006 crisis over prisoners who had not been deported.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice said the jails, which have immigration and language services, were part of a plan to deport as many foreign prisoners as possible.</p>
<p>More than 11,000 of the 81,000 prison population are foreign nationals.</p>
<p>In 2006 the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke was sacked over the Home Office&rsquo;s failure to process the cases of 1,000 foreign national prisoners in England and Wales who could have been eligible for deportation.</p>
<p>The decision to convert two prisons just for foreign inmates came as the department reviewed its deportation strategy.</p>
<p>But the move to set up the two specialist prisons has come with virtually no publicity.</p>
<p>The names of the jails emerged in a briefing by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers. Bullwood Hall is now holding 172 prisoners, while a further 283 are at Canterbury.</p>
<p>About 11,000 others are detained elsewhere alongside British prisoners.</p>
<p>Ms Owers said the two prisons had been given specific services for foreign inmates, including language support and advice on immigration issues.</p>
<p>She said it was easier to provide these services in one place and the move was similar to other specialist prisons such as those for juveniles.</p>
<p>The Independent Monitoring Board, which reports on prison conditions, said staff at Bullwood Hall had been unprepared for the move, but at Canterbury it was working well.</p>
<p><b>Higher costs</b></p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, which has been responsible for prisons since the break-up of the Home Office, said the two jails each had five immigration officials brought in to speed up deportation procedures.</p>
<p>Ministers would also review how well the two prisons were working to decide if any more should be set up, although the costs per inmate were higher at more than Â£38,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;The foreign national prisoner prisons are higher than the average cost of a category C trainer [prison] due to additional costs for translators and other specialist services,&#8221; said a spokesman.</p>
<p>Justice minister David Hanson said the jails were an experiment to see if deportations could be speeded up.</p>
<p>He said agreements had been set up with more than 100 countries which meant prisoners deported part-way through their sentences could serve the remainder in their home country.</p>
<p>Talks were ongoing to try to establish agreements with more countries including Jamaica, Nigeria and Vietnam, he said.</p>
<p>He told BBC&rsquo;s Breakfast 1,500 foreign criminals were deported in 2005, rising to 2,500 last year and it was expected 4,000 would be deported this year.</p>
<p>The Home Office said it was &#8220;currently taking legislation through the House of Commons to improve the speed with which individuals are identified and processed for deportation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shadow justice secretary Nick Herbert said: &#8220;If the government kept its promise to deport them [foreign prisoners], there would be extra space in our jails and no reason to release other prisoners early.&#8221;</p>
<p>The MP for Canterbury and Whitstable, Tory Julian Brazier, said: &#8220;Our prisons would not be anything like so overcrowded today if they had stopped illegal foreigners coming in and rapidly deported those convicted of crimes at the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former chief inspector of prisons Lord David Ramsbotham said the converted prisons made sense but more were needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Concentrating on foreign nationals in one prison makes it easier for that prison and also lessens the problems elsewhere,&#8221; he told BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when you look at the figures there are a huge number of prisoners in Wormwood Scrubs and Wandsworth, and having two prisons holding about 500 prisoners out of a total of about 11,000 is merely scratching the surface of a bigger problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colin Moses, of the Prison Officers Association, said it would be better to put resources into moving them through the system more quickly and repatriating them.</p>
<p>But Paddy Scriven, general secretary of the Prison Governors Association, said it made it easier to manage the prison purse and stopped foreign inmates from being so isolated.<br><br>
