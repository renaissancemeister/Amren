<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A teenage spat over ice cubes has morphed into a racially charged conflict that has two schools in lockdown, four girls facing assault charges and chat rooms buzzing with talk of a race war.</p>
<p>But administrators representing English-language Lester B. Pearson High School and nearby French-language Henri Bourassa did their best to minimize last week&rsquo;s beating of a 14-year-old girl over a racial slur she uttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to remember this is an isolated case involving only a few individuals,&#8221; Anthony Bernardelli, who heads the school board responsible for Henri Bourassa, told reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>The controversy began Wednesday at a Burger King in Montreal&rsquo;s ethnically diverse north end, where a 14-year-old Pearson student was hit by an ice cube tossed by a group of girls from Henri Bourassa.</p>
<p>The girl, who is white, has admitted to reacting with a racial slur.</p>
<p>A group of about 15 girls, most of them black, later jumped the student and her friend, punching and kicking her repeatedly in a park. Her beating was filmed and posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>The two girls were treated for minor injuries.</p>
<p>A day after the attack, students from Henri Bourassa, which is predominantly Haitian, had to be chased from Pearson by police after breaking several windows.</p>
<p>As many as half of Pearson&rsquo;s students didn&rsquo;t show up for class on Friday with administrators reassuring parents their children would not be marked absent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand their concern,&#8221; said Sylvia Lo Bianco, the school board commissioner responsible for Pearson.</p>
<p>By yesterday, Montreal police had charged four teenagers between 14 and 16 with assault for their role in the attack. They are to appear in youth court later this week.</p>
<p>Although there were no classes at either school yesterday because of a previously scheduled professional development day, representatives from the two institutions met to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to try to return to the daily routine as quickly as possible,&#8221; said Ms. Lo Bianco, who took part in the meetings.</p>
<p>She stressed that dialogue has always been strong between the two schools, and that both sides would work to increase that interaction.</p>
<p>Police have already increased their presence in the area, and will beef it up even more when classes resume today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have community officers who will meet with teachers and students to talk about what happened and to make sure such an incident never repeats itself,&#8221; said police spokesperson Lynne Labelle.</p>
<p>The added vigilance may be welcome given some of the heated rhetoric that viewers of the video have posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>Comments on the website included outright racist remarks about blacks and Italians.</p>
<p>But while tensions appear to be rising &mdash; if only in the virtual world &mdash; local community workers are warning the public, and the media, not to read too much into the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&rsquo;t more racial tensions between youngsters here than elsewhere,&#8221; said William Lamarre, who heads a youth outreach program in the neighbourhood.</p>
