<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The general consensus is that it [the Flynn Effect] is a real effect, and that scores are indeed rising not only in the West, but in the 3rd World as well. From 1925-1995, IQ scores in the West rose about 3 points a decade, or about 20 points. The effect is seen across all racial groups.</p>
<p>There have been many arguments back and forth about this phenomenon. White racists say that the effect is not real and that it is only measuring a &#8220;test-taking effect&#8221;. That is, as people get better and better at taking tests in our test-taking societies, IQ scores will rise, but it is not a real increase in intelligence, it only shows that people are getting better at taking tests.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that these same racists are the very folks who like to bellow about the &#8220;low Black IQ&#8221; of 85, 15 points below the White average. They seem to think that this 15-point difference is real. But IQ tests are either valid or they are not. They either measure real intelligence or they just measure some fake &#8220;test-taking ability&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words, if the Flynn Effect is fake, so are IQ tests themselves. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>Despite a mountain of increasingly Lysenko-like Leftist opposition to the notion that IQ tests measure intelligence, there is increasing agreement among psychometricians that IQ tests do in fact do a good job of measuring intelligence, and are not culturally biased in any way.</p>
<p>Other racists argue that the Flynn Effect is only occurring on the subtests of the IQ test that are lowest in the g factor. The g factor is a hypothetical factor that is thought to be highly genetic and is considered a &#8220;pure&#8221; measure of intelligence. In fact, the Flynn Effect has shown its highest scores in those subtests highest in g.</p>
<p>There have been many theories about what is causing the rise in IQ scores. Some suggest better nutrition, which is leading to taller people with larger heads. Others say it is an increasingly technological society, with computers, videogames and cellphones all making people smarter. Others say that the increased availability and quality of education is making people smarter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Much is made of the present Black IQ score of 85. Racists rant that it is set in stone and use it show why they feel Black societies, including ancient ones, have not accomplished much in their opinion. The 85 score is seen as set in stone for all time. Not only is it the same as it has always been, but it is irremediable, as IQ is, so the racists say, 80% genetic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First of all, one must understand just what an IQ score really is. An IQ score is merely a relative score, and as scores rise, the tests are regularly re-normed at the 100 average here in the US. Therefore, the 20 point IQ rise has been completely masked.</p>
<p>Whites scored 100 and Blacks scored 85 in 1925. In 1995, after a 20 point rise in both groups, Whites scored 100 and Blacks scored 85 once again. Do you follow? The regular renorming of the tests reduced the gains to invisibility.</p>
<p>Further, a score of 85 is not necessarily &#8220;low&#8221; and a score of 115 or even 130 is not necessarily &#8220;high&#8221;. With average set at 100, the scores work like this: 66% of the group will score between 85 and 115. 15% of the group will score between 70 and 85 and another 15% will score between 115 and 130. 2% will score below 70 and another 2% will score above 130.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racists take it further and say that with an average IQ of 70-85 (depending on the region), Blacks are simply incapable of creating decent civilized societies anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>Instead of simply dismissing this argument, we need to take it on head-on. We need to ask these same racists whether the average White American in 1945 was so stupid that he was doomed to the very same pathologies and failures ascribed to US Blacks today. Surely they will say no.</p>
<p>US culture in 1945 was White culture. Blacks were segregated and kept down. US White culture beat Nazism and Japanese fascism and then built up US society into a first-rate industrial power. Illegitimacy, drug and alcohol addiction, welfare use, and unemployment were low. Educational attainment and health status was good and parenting styles were competent and behavior was widely viewed as highly civilized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The IQ is US Blacks today is exactly the same as the IQ of US Whites in 1945!</b></p>
<p>The US Black IQ of 85 today is equivalent to the US White IQ of 100 in 1945, due to a 15 point rise in Black IQ (1995-2005 saw little Black IQ growth).</p>
<p>Which leads us to some painful questions. If US Whites could build, after 1945, one of the greatest Western societies of our time, why could not Blacks, in 2007, do the same? I believe White racism plays some role in Black failure to equal White rates of achievement 60 years before. But there is no way that &#8220;racism&#8221; can explain all or even most of this failure. Much of it must be laid on Black society itself.</p>
<p>What is fascinating is that we also cannot blame Black &#8220;low IQ&#8221; for this failure in attainment. That is because Black IQ in 2007 is not low, unless you think Whites in 1945 were stupid.</p>
<p>Equally fascinating is that the Black pathologies above exploded after 1960. This serious pathology, visible for all to see in the Black underclass, continues today. <b>The explosion in these pathologies coincided with a rise in Black IQ in the US of an incredible 10-11 points!</b></p>
<p>If these pathologies were in any way linked to IQ, we would expect (Dramatically!) rising Black IQ to cause plummets in all of the pathologies bolded above. Instead, as Blacks got smarter, their culture, in many ways, got sicker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The failure of the US Black underclass, and even the failures, corruption and chaos inherent in many heavily-Black US cities, from Detroit to Newark, may have many causes, but Black average IQ cannot be one of them.</p>
<p>The explosion of Black pathologies from 1960 on cannot possibly be related to Black IQ levels, which rose explosively during this period. Rising IQ is linked by many studies to lower levels of all the pathologies bolded above. <b>Therefore, rising Black IQ could not possibly have caused these problems.</b></p>
<p>The increase in these same pathologies coincided with the US Civil Rights Movement and the liberation of US Blacks from segregation and the worst of White societal racism. The decades in the interim have seen plummeting levels of White racism against Blacks, in tandem with rocketing Black pathology.</p>
<p>If White racism caused Black pathology, dramatic declines in White structural racism should have seen plummeting Black pathology. Instead, it shot to the skies.</p>
<p><b>To sum up, neither Black IQ nor White racism are adequate to explain the increase in Black pathologies since 1960, the failure of the Black underclass, and the chaos, corruption and general entropy of many large US Black cities.</b></p>
<p>Things don&rsquo;t happen for no reason. When searching for reasons for these Black problems, we need to look further than the usual scapegoats, White racism and Black IQ scores.</p>
