						<p>The failure of Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan to pay up in a racial discrimination case could bankrupt the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in this crime-plagued city, after a federal appeals judge found Monday that its $3.5 million in assets could be seized to meet the debt.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing dozens of white office workers who successfully sued Jordan for replacing them with black workers said they would use leverage from the finding to force New Orleans officials to include a payoff in the next city budget. The workers are owed $3.65 million in damages stemming from the 2005 case. The city&rsquo;s budget is due on Nov. 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision that&rsquo;s going to have to be made by responsible people in the city is whether they want a D.A.&rsquo;s office,&#8221; said Clement P. Donelon, who represents the 35 former workers.</p>
<p>Donelon said he did not fear community backlash if he took money from the coffers of the office, which already suffers from a low prosecution rate and bungled homicide cases. New Orleans has the highest murder rate in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not us shutting it down. It&rsquo;s the city shutting it down,&#8221; Donelon said, urging the mayor and city council to take action to compensate his clients.</p>

					<p>They haven&rsquo;t paid off the suit because they <span class="caps">HATE </span>that the money is going to &#8220;White folks!&#8221; I,for one,love seeing them get a dose of their own medicine! They are experts at extorting &#8220;free money&#8221; from Whites for some made-up nonsense and have done it as long as I can remember. I think more Whites should do this when givin the chance,I know I will. I don&rsquo;t understand why the Duke boys don&rsquo;t sue the hell out of the naacp,al $harpton, je$$ie jack$on and the &#8220;new&#8221; black panthers!!!</p>

					<p>Can everbody imagine what the proficiency of this office is going to be, filled with low intelligence blacks?  I&rsquo;m asking rhetorically, of course, because I know everybody here is fully aware of what the dismal state of affairs is going to be.  It will be Zimbabwe West.</p>

					<p>Eddie Jordan, Al Sharpton, Orenthal J. Simpson.  Do any of these people <span class="caps">EVER </span>pay up when a civil verdict goes against them?  Have they <span class="caps">EVER </span>taken responsibility for their actions?  Predicting this outcome was like predicting that the sun would rise in the east. </p>

					<p>The only good things coming out of Louisiana in recent years seems to be the election of a new young governor, Bobby Jindal.<br>
Everything else seems terrible, especially New Orleans DA Eddie Jordan.  Instead of addressing the out of control crime wave, Jordan replaced almost all of his experienced white staff with <br><br>
 newly hired blacks.  Now he can&rsquo;t pay the $3.7 million judgment that is growning at $20,000 a month.  This guy is a major league bozo who should be kicked out of that important office.   However, despite being a racist and a complete incompetent, chances are almost certain he will be reelected just because he&rsquo;s black.  Look at how long Charlie Rangel has been in office as proof positive.</p>

					<p>Recently, District Attorney Jordan was involved in an incident where an armed robber took refuge in his home, while he was home, while the police were searching the area for this perpetrator. Whether Jordan actively participated in the harboring of this fugitive or not, this is not conduct becoming of an elected official, nonetheless the sitting District Attorney.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal found that the District Attorney had withheld exculpatory information from the defense in the Danziger Bridge case, violating one of the most sacrosanct tenets of criminal law. In the same case, Mr Jordan attempted to use testimony from police officers testifying to the grand jury under immunity, to charge those same officers with crimes.</p>
<p> District Attorney Jordan&rsquo;s hiring and firing practices when first elected has led to a $3.5 million billion for  the taxpayers of this City by engaging in racially motivated personnel decisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office has been the most dysfunctional part of the Criminal Justice system since Jordan&rsquo;s election, with over 2 thousand arrestees released back to the streets. In 2006 there were 161 murders in new orleans, and less than four convictions for murder.</p>
<p>These are serious departures from the normative behavior in our society. In addition, the public&rsquo;s trust has been deteriorated to the point that nobody has any faith in the District Attorney&rsquo;s ability to get his job done, including his own staff of attorneys. Judges in several courts have commented publicly from the bench regarding the lack of preparation by the D A&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>There have been calls for Mr. Jordan&rsquo;s resignation, but they have been by individuals.</p>
<p>It is time for the public at large to call for Mr. Jordan&rsquo;s resignation. Mr. Jordan&rsquo;s behavior and lack of ability to do the job he was elected to do should be offensive to every member of this community.</p>

					<p>From the Article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;..The decision that&rsquo;s going to have to be made by responsible people in the city is whether they want a <span class="caps">D.A.</span>&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; said Clement P. Donelon, who represents the 35 former workers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this gem:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;..which already suffers from a low prosecution rate and bungled homicide cases. New Orleans has the highest murder rate in the country&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What on earth would be the difference if the office were shut down?  Would anyone notice?   With all the bumbling and ineptitude the <span class="caps">D.A.</span>&rsquo;s office is <span class="caps">ALREADY</span> Zimbabwe West, as Robert pointed out.</p>
<p>What frosts me about this case is the abject lack of publicity via the lamestream press &mdash;  this is why I boycott them wherever and whenever possible, as I would suggest for all Whites.  I believe our shunning of the <span class="caps">MSM </span>is making an impact nationally as I&rsquo;ve gleefully read about major, mainstream papers cutting back drastically if not outright shutting down.  The sooner they die off the better &mdash; may they go the way of the former Soviet Union, whose failed policies they continue to admire so much</p>
<p>Could you imagine the backlash and outrage, the marches, if the races were reversed?</p>
<p>Do I detect the wind blowing in a new direction?</p>

					<p>Mr. Jordan&rsquo;s ineptness in prosecuting criminals (4 out of 161 murders?!) is yet another reason to stay far away from the chocolate city. Just imagine yourself innocently getting caught up in that bungling legal system! You could languish for months in a NO jail. Scary!<br>

					<p>Eddie Jordan was quite frank about his reasons for firing the white employees. He said he was not discriminating on the basis of race, but on political patronage.  He fired white attorneys and staff who did not support his campaign for DA and was replacing them with black people who did support him.</p>
<p>I think the black folk of New Orleans are entitled to have a DA and attorneys of their choice.  If they want to get rid of good white attorneys and put their safety in the hands of black incompetents they are welcome to.  I believe in diversity and multiculturalism and certainly don&rsquo;t want to impose white standards and culture on New Orleans against its will.</p>
<p>I think the white US Attorneys and white National Guardsmen that Louisiana begged to come enforce the law that Eddie and his friends just can&rsquo;t, should be removed from Louisiana, however.  If he really needs white folks to take care of him and his black brethren, he should hire them with his own money. New Orleans should face its own incompetence and wallow in it.  </p>

					<p>Interesting that this county can&rsquo;t come up with the relatively small sum of $3.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>Or have the alternative to welfare affirmative action blacks strip the treasury?</p>
