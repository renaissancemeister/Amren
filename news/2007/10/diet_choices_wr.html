						<p>Our genes and not just our upbringing may play a key role in our food likes and dislikes, UK researchers believe.</p>
<p>Experts from Kings College London compared the eating habits of thousands of pairs of twins.</p>
<p>Identical twins were far more likely to share the same dietary patterns &mdash; like a penchant for coffee and garlic &mdash; suggesting tastes may be inherited.</p>
<p>A health psychologist said this meant childhood food foibles might be harder to put right than previously thought.</p>
<p>Identical twins have exactly the same genetic make-up as each other, so scientists, by comparing them to non-identical twins, can work out the likelihood that their characteristics are due to &#8220;nature&#8221; or &#8220;nurture&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Kings College researchers looked at a total of more than 3,000 female twins aged between 18 and 79, working out their broad preferences using five different dietary &#8220;groups&#8221;.</p>
<p>These included diets heavy in fruit and vegetables, alcohol, fried meat and potatoes, and low-fat products or low in meat, fish and poultry.</p>
<p><b>Coffee inheritance</b></p>
<p>Their results, published in the journal Twin Research and Human Genetics, suggested that between 41% and 48% of a person&rsquo;s leaning towards one of the food groups was influenced by genetics.</p>
<p>The strongest link between individual liking and genes involved a taste for garlic and coffee.</p>
<p>Professor Tim Spector, who led the research, said: &#8220;For so long we have assumed that our upbringing and social environment determine what we like to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has blown that theory out of the water &mdash; more often than not, our genetic make-up influences our dietary patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers suggested that healthy eating campaigns, such as the government&rsquo;s &#8220;five-a-day&#8221; fruit and vegetable initiative, might have to be re-thought in light of the findings, as people genetically &#8220;programmed&#8221; to eat less fruit and vegetables would be more resistant to health messages than thought.</p>
<p><b>Brain &lsquo;rewards&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Professor Jane Wardle, from University College, said that the findings, and other similar research, pointed to genetics playing a &#8220;moderate&#8221; part in the development of preferred foods.</p>
<p>She said that it was possible that genes involved with taste, or the &#8220;reward&#8221; chemicals released by the body in response to certain foods, might play a role.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have always made the assumption that food choices are all due to environmental factors during life, but it now seems this isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also suggests that what parents do to influence eating habits in childhood are not necessarily as important as we thought &mdash; and that a lot of effort may need to be made with young people as they become independent in adolescence to steer them onto the right course.&#8221;</p>
