						<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation says the number of public corruption cases in New Orleans has more than quintupled.</p>
<p>The FBI attributed the rise in cases to a federal initiative targeting corruption in post-Katrina New Orleans and a billboard campaign that urges locals to come forward with information about public corruption, USA Today reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Howard Schwartz, supervisory special agent for public corruption in the FBI&rsquo;s New Orleans&rsquo; office, said 171 people in the New Orleans area were indicted on public corruption charges, including bribery and fraud, between 2003 and the middle of September 2007. He said more than 80 percent of those indicted were convicted or pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>Schwartz said most of the indicted were public officials, including police officers, city councilmen and a former school board president.</p>

					<p>Could the increase in corruption have anything to do with the combination of a black city government and a lot of federal hand out money?  Just a thought.</p>

					<p>Follow the money is the operative axiom here. Big Federal post Katrina relief dollars flowing from Washington to local &#8220;Chocolate City&#8221; &#8220;administrators&#8221; is a sure fire recipe for what we are seeing.</p>

					<p>This is nothing new, I am shocked its even being investigated, all across America there is such a culture of corruption attached to these government programs, just the amount of funds lost to fraud throughout these programs would more than fund the war on terror. </p>

					<p><span class="caps">N.O. </span>is on it&rsquo;s last legs. It&rsquo;s an African Nation similar to Zem-bah-wee&rsquo; whereas the Blacks have ran &#8216;whitie&rsquo; out and now Blacks must try and make all the decisions. It&rsquo;s &#8216;a laugh a minute&rsquo; to watch the judgement calls carried out by these pre/post Convicts pretending to be intelligent. When all wisdom has left the area, all that&rsquo;s left is instinct and the &#8216;me first&rsquo; syndrome. Nagin is first and all others are left to snatch up the curmbs.</p>
<p>Detroit South just &#8216;shut yo mouth&rsquo; and call in a load of dirt. It&rsquo;s over! </p>

					<p>You can&rsquo;t put a band-aid on cancer.<br>
After Katrina and the media&rsquo;s spin to average Joe American,<br><br>
Bush/Congress should have appointed a &#8220;Katrina Czar&#8221; to oversee the operation and dispersal of funding to those affected by the storm. The Corp of Engineers should have/be reprimanded for negligence and profiteering.</p>
<p>But as for the &#8220;woe is me&#8221; tone of the city of <span class="caps">N.O., </span>you raped and pillaged while the flooding occured, there is not a lot of interest in rewarding people for that.</p>
<p>As a side note: The Mississippi Gulf Coast was battered by Katrina. The city of New Orleans just happens to be built below sea level and behind a levee. You take your chances with mother nature sometimes. Sometimes, you are just live stupid.</p>

The unspoken motto of blacks is &#8216;I got mine&rsquo;. Most are bidding their time until the payoff. Once it comes, they could care less about anyone else; &#8216;Movin&rsquo; on up!&rsquo; and all that. It&rsquo;s part of the endemic pathology.</p>

					<p>Katrina must have hit other areas too besides <span class="caps">N.O.</span> What about the gulf coast of Mississippi and Louisiana? You never hear anything about these areas; about how the people there fared and are making out. Did they get back on their feet? Is the media silence because the areas are white? Are they White? Maybe AmRen could do a story about Katrina&rsquo;s <span class="caps">OTHER </span>ignored (non-N.O.) victims.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Schwartz said most of the indicted were public officials, including police officers, city councilmen and a former school board president.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is only to be expected. After all, the indicted are probably <span class="caps">BLACK </span>(Afro-Americans0. Remember the WalMart looting episode in the aftermath of Katrina. Yeah, they were just foraging for food and clean clothes. There is a lot of nourishment to be found in stolen guns, ammo and high-value electronics like plasma TVs, right? And why not steal <span class="caps">EXPENSIVE </span>clothes if you have nothing clean to wear?</p>
<p>Then again, there was that incident of 28 Cadillacs   &mdash;   &#8220;borrowed&#8221; by members of the <span class="caps">N.O.</span> Police Dept.   &mdash;   just to patrol those waterlooged, debris-strewn streets. I mean why <span class="caps">STEAL SOMETHING PRACICAL </span>  &mdash;   like trucks? You&rsquo;re gonna steal, man, steal Cadillacs.</p>
<p>Most likely, this little scandal was probably instigated by the honorable mayor, Ray Nagin. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the stolen Cadillacs were stolen from a dealership owned by a friend or crony of Ragin. With costly insurance claims submitted afterwards, by the dealership.</p>
<p>Then again, there&rsquo;s that Louisiana Congressman, the &#8220;honorable&#8221; Mr. Jeffords. Indited for taking bribes, caught red-handed with a freezer full of (dare I say it)   &mdash;   <span class="caps">COLD CASH</span>!</p>
<p>Seems just about <span class="caps">EVERY</span> Black elected to public office, in a leadership position for his fellow Blacks   &mdash;   invariably turns out to be a crook. Right now we have Barak Obama making a run for the presidency. (If he can win the nod of the democratic party.) Would anyone care to guess how soon those inevitable scandals of theft, corruption in high places would start, should Obama actually win the presidency? </p>
<p>Blacks are to crime, theft, corruption and vice like cold is to icde. Simply inseparable. Right now <span class="caps">EUROPE </span>is being overrun by Blacks from Africa. Predictably, crime and social problems accompany them. Any questions?</p>

					<p>Thank you Jim Letten!  This <span class="caps">FBI </span>investigator is taking them down, one by one.<br>
For the poster who says we need a &#8220;Recovery Czar&#8221;- the Feds thought so, too.  They let Nagin appoint another Nagin crony.</p>
<p>As to all this money supposedly coming in- I wonder where it goes?  I don&rsquo;t see it.  All I see is homeowners and business owners (mostly white) doing it all on their own, using their savings and retirement, and what little insurance settlements they got.</p>

					<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing - I&rsquo;m suprised.  $60 billion for K.  That is more than enough to go around for everybody.  And now they&rsquo;re suing each other?  Oh come on.  Here&rsquo;s my take - I guess the lawyers didn&rsquo;t feel they got enough.</p>

<p>Posted by at 3:31 PM on October 6 </p>
<p>Truly staggering indeed! It is mere monopoly money for our federal Leviathan who continuously bankrolls debt (as though no accounting for tomorrow) who in cahoots with the fraudulent Federal Reserve System manufactures counterfeit money to &#8220;inject&#8221; into our engineered failing economy.  </p>
<p>As an individual who moved from the Mississippi coastal area following Katrina, the contrast between the two states in the immediate aftermath and subsequently is compelling.  For one, Gov. Barbour let it be known immediately that &#8220;looters would be shot.&#8221;  There was little to NO looting. </p>
<p>For anyone interested in a fantastic accounting of Louisiana prior to and after Katrina, I highly recommend Tulane historian Doug Brinkley&rsquo;s &#8220;The Great Deluge.&#8221;  It gives an honest (though he is like virtually all professors a liberal) appraisal of the pre and post Katrina Louisianna.  There are also a few noteworthy contrasts between Mississippi&rsquo;s and Louisianna&rsquo;s handling of the greatest natural disaster to ever hit the <span class="caps">U.S.   </span></p>

<p>Thanks for that link.  When we moved to Pass Christian, MS four years ago, I was surprised to find the exemplary private Catholic school, St. Stanislaus Preparatory College - home to students from over forty countries who board there as well, on the beautiful, oceanfront in Bay St. Louis.  It had been destroyed decades earlier by Camille, and again by Katrina.  Our son attended and graduated from that fine school after two years, and it has since been rebuilt yet again.  We were truly impressed with the quality education our son was blessed to have received there (acquired an almost full scholarship to the U of Miami.)</p>
