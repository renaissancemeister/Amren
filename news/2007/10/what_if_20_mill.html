<p>That&rsquo;s a good question &mdash; it deserves an answer. Over 80 percent of Americans demand secured borders and illegal migration stopped. But what would happen if all 20 million or more vacated America? The answers may surprise you!</p>
<p>*&nbsp;In California, if 3.5 million illegal aliens moved back to Mexico, it would leave an extra $10.2 billion to spend on overloaded school systems, bankrupted hospitals and overrun prisons. It would leave highways cleaner, safer and less congested. Everyone could understand one another as English became the dominate language again.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;In Colorado, 500,000 illegal migrants, plus their 300,000 kids and grand-kids &mdash; would move back &#8220;home,&#8221; mostly to Mexico. That would save Coloradans an estimated $2 billion (other experts say $7 BIL) annually in taxes that pay for schooling, medical, social-services and incarceration costs. It means 12,000 gang members would vanish out of Denver alone.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Colorado would save more than $20 million in prison costs, and the terror that those 7,300 alien criminals set upon local citizens. Denver Officer Don Young and hundreds of Colorado victims would not have suffered death, accidents, rapes and other crimes by illegals.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Denver Public Schools would not suffer a 67 percent drop out/flunk out rate via thousands of illegal alien students speaking 41 different languages. At least 200,000 vehicles would vanish from our gridlocked cities in Colorado. Denver&rsquo;s four percent unemployment rate would vanish as our working poor would gain jobs at a living wage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>*&nbsp;In Chicago, Illinois, 2.1 million illegals would free up hospitals, schools, prisons and highways for a safer, cleaner and more crime-free experience.</p>
<p><b>If 20 million illegal aliens returned &#8220;home&#8221; &mdash; </b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No more push &lsquo;1&rsquo; for Spanish or &lsquo;2&rsquo; for English. No more confusion in American schools that now must content with over 100 languages that degrade the educational system for American kids. Our overcrowded schools would lose more than two million illegal alien kids at a cost of billions in ESL and free breakfasts and lunches.</p>
<p>We would lose 500,000 illegal criminal alien inmates at a cost of more than $1.6 billion annually. That includes 15,000 MS-13 gang members who distribute $130 billion in drugs annually would vacate our country. In cities like L.A., 20,000 members of the &#8220;18th Street Gang&#8221; would vanish from our nation. No more Mexican forgery gangs for ID theft from Americans! No more foreign rapists and child molesters!</p>
<p>Losing more than 20 million people would clear up our crowded highways and gridlock. Cleaner air and less drinking and driving American deaths by illegal aliens!</p>
<p><b>Drain on America&rsquo;s economy; taxpayers harmed, employers get rich</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least 400,000 anchor babies would not be born in our country, costing us $109 billion per year per cycle. At least 86 hospitals in California, Georgia and Florida would still be operating instead of being bankrupted out of existence because illegals pay nothing via the EMTOLA Act. Americans wouldn&rsquo;t suffer thousands of TB and hepatitis cases rampant in our country &mdash; brought in by illegals unscreened at our borders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over one million of Mexico&rsquo;s poorest citizens now live inside and along our border from Brownsville, Texas to San Diego, California in what the New York Times called, &#8220;colonias&#8221; or new neighborhoods. Trouble is, those living areas resemble Bombay and Calcutta where grinding poverty, filth, diseases, drugs, crimes, no sanitation and worse. They live without sewage, clean water, streets, electricity, roads or any kind of sanitation. The New York Times reported them to be America&rsquo;s new &#8220;Third World&#8221; inside our own country. Within 20 years, at their current growth rate, they expect 20 million residents of those colonias. (I&rsquo;ve seen them personally in Texas and Arizona; it&rsquo;s sickening beyond anything you can imagine.) By enforcing our laws, we could repatriate them back to Mexico.</p>
<p><b>High integrity, ethical invitation</b></p>
<p>We invite 20 million aliens to go home, fix their own countries and/or make a better life in Mexico. We invite a million people into our country legally more than all other countries combined annually. We cannot and must not allow anarchy at our borders, more anarchy within our borders and growing lawlessness at every level in our nation.</p>

					<p><span class="caps">HH,</span> I lived briefly in such a place. It was called Germany. In Hamburg I could go out at 3am, with no fear of anything. Even heroin dealers in Hamburg say please and thank you. Bakery on nearly every corner, clean, orderly, and other than a few Turks - its just Germans. Or at least it was in 1993-1994 when we upgraded the credit card &amp; <span class="caps">ATM </span>networks to be able to process international transactions properly (and at all in some areas). </p>
<p>I never felt unsafe there. I never felt I had to look over my shoulder or even care who was coming down the street.  It still had problems, unemployment in certain trades was pretty high, and unemployment was higher than here at the time.  Crime? Not really a problem even on the radar. </p>

					<p>The cost of everything from gasoline to seafood would drop drastically because the increasing number of invaders would not be here to compete with us for our own rapidly dimminshing resources and consequently distort the market for consumer goods.  The oil companies deliberately haven&rsquo;t built a new refinery in America in thirty years so they can restrict supply and constantly boost prices.  Removing the tens of millions of Hispanics from our country would reduce demand for heating oil and gasoline and the oil company racketeers would have no choice but to lower costs…    </p>

					<p>&#8220;Over one million of Mexico&rsquo;s poorest citizens now live inside and along our border from Brownsville, Texas to San Diego, California in what the New York Times called, &ldquo;colonias&rdquo; or new neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>  In my home city, I&rsquo;m not allowed to park on the street after 2 am. I&rsquo;ll be fined if I do. With that said, I wonder how in the world are these people allowed to literally colonize a soveriegn nation with as much &#8220;power&#8221; as we think we have? The feds, with the help of the media, are more interested in vindicating these people and using our wages to satisfy their needs. So I ask, does this lead us to a taxation without representation situation? Remember what happened last time the powers that were imposed that on us?</p>

					<p>Dear God, if only this were true! </p>
<p>My parents lived in a $750,000+ home in a nice Bay Area neighborhood. They were driven <span class="caps">OUT </span>of their home by the man next door (who became a citizen during the last amnesty in &#8216;86) running a flophouse for illegal Mexicans. This guy was collecting up to $800 apiece from each of his 10-12 renters! Tax free! </p>
<p>Calls to the local authorities were practically useless, as were calls to <span class="caps">ICE </span>and immigration. They are overwhelmed. The only one who showed a spark of interest was the <span class="caps">IRS.</span> My mom and dad ended up renting their house and moving to get away from it all.</p>
<p>Go grocery shopping around the first of the month sometime. Or to traffic court. It is positively sickening. I am a fourth generation Californian, but I am seriously considering leaving the state, it&rsquo;s that bad. </p>

					<p>Fed Up:  If your parents had taken matters into their own hands rather than expecting the government to act in their behalf they could have easily inspired their unwanted neighbor to leave the neighborhood if they were willing to take the necessary actions required to make it happen&hellip;            </p>

					<p>Mexicans are a hygenically-challenged, opportunistic, acquisitive group of people.  They have childlike, magical thinking.  How else could a candidate for Mexican presidency promise both to do away with taxes <span class="caps">AND </span>give welfare to all  &mdash;  -and be <span class="caps">BELIEVED</span>!?  How else could they point to a map and say that, since they were in North America and we were the United States of America, they owned America? How else could they ignore the treaties of Velasco and Guadalupe-Hidalgo and <span class="caps">INSIST </span>that the Rio Grande is not the Rio Grande, but the Pecos&hellip;make that the Nueces&hellip;.no, maybe the Colorado&hellip;or the Brazos&hellip;oh, wait a minute: the Mississippi  &mdash;   <span class="caps">THAT&rsquo;S </span>it!? </p>
<p>How else could their Mexican priests convince them that if they come to America, they could live in castles and be able to send money back to the parishes?  Or how else could drug dealers convince them that if they send money to Mexico, they would allow the illegals to survive?</p>
<p>Here in Houston, driving is a defensive exercise.  Our illegally-arrived neighbors have been told that if they can get into an accident with a gringo, they will not only have free medical care for them <span class="caps">AND </span>their super-fecund families, but they will get a <span class="caps">NEW CAR </span>from our insurance.  Sort of like &#8220;Price is Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our local news tried to post a daily list of lawbreakers (&#8220;Wheel of Justice&#8221;), and the lawbreakers read like a who&rsquo;s who of Mexico city until <span class="caps">LULAC </span>demanded some token whites and blacks be added.  But listen to the news, and if you hear of a fire, a horrific traffic accident, a drug deal gone bad, or a murder, five will get you ten you will hear about Jesus, Hector, or Santiago.</p>
<p>A quick trip to a hospital ER will show the gringos standing in line, handing over insurance and verification-of-insurance, blank checks, and credit cards to get treatment for real emergencies.  Meanwhile, the Mexican families are smirkingly ushered in so grandmother&rsquo;s ingrown toenail can be fixed, so cousin can have his headache cured, so this one can take something for his tummy ache, and on and on.  Forget about the dengue fever, malaria, resistant <span class="caps">TB, </span>and polio they are bringing in: they will get free treatment at our expense. </p>
<p>I just got a jury summons written in both English and Spanish. Think about it. How can that <span class="caps">WORK</span>?  And driver&rsquo;s licneses for illegals? What would <span class="caps">THAT </span>accomplish?  In Mexico, one can just buy a &#8220;license&#8221; from someone with a license pad, no laws, no rules, no thought. Driving is a free-for-all.  So if we let them have driver&rsquo;s licenses, one guy would get one; then he&rsquo;d loan it out to hundreds of others. Meanwhile, he and those who &#8220;share&#8221; his name would have a sense of entitlement, an incentive to try to take more, while terroristic illegals would have a breeder document with which to obtain <span class="caps">MORE </span>documents.</p>
<p>Are they hard workers? Only for a little while.  Only for as long as it takes to buy a little tequilla and send some money back to the folks at home.  After hundreds of years of 5-harvests-a-year, they have evolved into a people who can loaf around for 4 harvests, &#8220;acquiring&#8221; needed food and drink from neighbors, taking &#8220;a little now, and a little again at another time.&#8221; That is <span class="caps">NOT </span>the American work ethic. And think of <span class="caps">THIS</span>: if our ultra-liberals got their way and American agricultural workers were all fired, do you <span class="caps">REALLY </span>think that our produce would go down <span class="caps">EXACTLY </span>the amount of money required to switch to illegal workers? </p>
<p>I have read some say that we &#8220;enticed&#8221; them here. So, if I rob a jewelery store, is that OK?  Cause I was, after all, enticed, right? Some say that our friends only come here illegally to feed their families. Gee whiz! Isn&rsquo;t that what a bank robber is doing? So, it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">OK, </span>right?</p>
<p>Oh, I know things in Mexico are lousy.  But it does not happen to be MY fault. It goes back to a relaxed group of people who will believe anything that seems too good to be true. Meanwhile, my taxes are going up to pay for <span class="caps">ESL </span>classes and food for all of our friends; our hospitals are closing because so many illegals are using our medical services for free; our grocery stores are filled with jostling people who eye my wallet; our stores are filled with Spanish-speaking workers who snap, &#8220;SSSSS!&#8221; when we try to ask for help; my auto insurance is rising to pay for all of our friends who wallow into accidents without the means to insure themselves; and I have to keep listening to Spanish every time I make a phone call.</p>
<p>Oh, I know we are a nation of immigrants.  But most of us had ancestors who came here when it was not illegal to do so, and most of us have ancestors who came, waited in line at Ellis Island, had definite jobs and homes to live in, had medical exams, promised (when a promise meant something) to learn English and become a citizen as soon as possible, and had someone here post a bond that they would never become a drain on our medical and educational systems.  These were immigrants who came to build a dream, not to try to steal a dream.</p>
<p>I waited thirty years to get the cash and the insurance coverage to get surgery for a congenital defect.  My first day visiting a highly-qualified surgeon, there was one of my illegal friends, smirking because he could get his surgery for next-to-nothing, with his granddaughter there to translate for him (what does <span class="caps">SHE </span>care if she misses school?  Her teachers will just pass her along).</p>
<p>As long as they can flop across the Rio and pop out a little anchor (right now, the illegal baby delivery rate in Harris County, <span class="caps">TX, </span>is a whopping 80%   &mdash;   talk about over-breeding! And who pays for all of that?), as long as illegals are granted public university tuition breaks not allowed to citizens from other states, as long as we   &mdash;   for whatever misguided, self-flagellating, cut-off-your-own-nose reason   &mdash;   keep coddling them, they will continue to come in and search for the castles and free food and free medical care and free drugs the Mexican priests and drug dealers promise them.</p>
<p>Paying Mexico to take them back would be great.  But it can&rsquo;t happen. Money sent back to Mexico from  the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>is Mexico&rsquo;s second largest supply of income, and for Mexico to accept them back would be killing the goose. </p>
<p>What we need, instead of a lot of politicians flapping their mouths, is to have our armed services (or militant civilians acting like armed services) patrol the border and make it <span class="caps">VERY </span>unpalatable to cross over to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span> We need to send them back: no feeding, no housing, no all-expenses-paid jail time. </p>
<p>We need to have electrical fences. Instead of accommodating them in our schools, stores, and hospitals, we need to turn them away. We need to stop singing Kumbaya. We need to tell them that what was good enough for <span class="caps">OUR </span>ancestors is good enough for them. We need to look at the Fourteenth Amendment and take the words &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the United States seriously because if you are here illegally, you&hellip;are&hellip;.here&hellip;.illegally and not subjecting yourself to any jurisdiction. Eventually, the word will get back that this may not be the place to go to steal dreams, and eventually we can take our country back.<br/>
