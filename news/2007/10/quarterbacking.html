<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>With one tricolored mouthpiece, USC&rsquo;s Mark Sanchez has done more to advance the image of Mexicans in Southern California than a thousand marches could ever hope to achieve.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the sophomore backup quarterback led the Trojans to a 38-0 mauling of Notre Dame&rsquo;s Fighting Irish. Reporters asked Sanchez afterward why he protected his teeth with a plastic mold decorated like the Mexican flag &mdash; green, white and red, with a miniature eagle clutching a snake while perching on a cactus &mdash; right in front of his incisors. The 22-year-old didn&rsquo;t flinch. &#8220;It&rsquo;s my heritage,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>Describing the mouth guard as &#8220;sweet&#8221; and &#8220;cool,&#8221; Sanchez went on to explain that using it was a &#8220;a portrayal of my love for my race&#8221; and hoped that his fashion flair &#8220;inspires&#8221; young Latinos who follow USC to do what he does: quarterback while Mexican. When a reporter told him some Trojans fans already were race-baiting his dental decision on radio and on Internet chat boards, Sanchez remained unfazed. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know it was that big of a deal,&#8221; he told a reporter. &#8220;Was it bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mouthpiece and subsequent interview might not be as iconic a civil rights moment in sports as the raised fists of Olympians Tommie Smith and John Carlos, or Jackie Robinson&rsquo;s first Major League swing, but Sanchez&rsquo;s actions are nevertheless profound. In this era when many Americans fret that Mexican immigrants and their children are destroying this nation, it&rsquo;s stunning that a prominent athlete such as Sanchez professes pride in his spicy roots &mdash; and also does it so nonchalantly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanchez &mdash; who is technically a third-generation Mexican American from ritzy Mission Viejo in Orange County &mdash; notably didn&rsquo;t identify himself as a Mexican American, Chicano or even American. Nope, just as Mexican. The first two qualify his identity, while Sanchez (like so many of his peers, myself included) doesn&rsquo;t feel it necessary to proclaim he&rsquo;s an American. That&rsquo;s kind of a given when you speak fluent English and were born and raised in this country. Giving such a shout-out to your pedigree is akin to Boston Red Sox fans donning Irish green ball caps, or New Jersey wiseguys crooning &#8220;Volare&#8221; along with Dino &mdash; an expression of ethnic solidarity, not sedition.</p>

					<p>Since the Toronto Raptors were admitted into the American <span class="caps">NBA</span> I quit supporting professional basketball and their sponsors.  <span class="caps">NBA </span>stands for National Basketball Association and Toronto, Canada is not part our nation, even though there are traitors who want it to be.  I suppose next they will create and add a Mexican basketball team to the <span class="caps">NBA </span>to complete their seditious North American Community sports cabal. We don&rsquo;t have to put up with having other countries join our national sports organizations and boycotts and letter writing can put an end to it&hellip; </p>

					<p>Well, well, I thought that the longer a non-white was on American soil and exposed to our culture that they would magically turn into Anglophiles.  Such is not the case with third generation mestizo Marky &#8220;Pancho Villa&#8221; Sanchez.  </p>
<p>I think we all know the treatment a white college quarterback would receive by the media and his university if he declared pride in his racial heritage.    </p>

<p>Hernan Cortes, but they hate him. But he was a marvelous leader of men.</p>
<p>Emiliano Zapata was a worthy hero, sincere in his desire to improve the lot of his people (unlike characters like Pancho Villa), but he suffered from that fatalistic variety of Mexican machismo that caused him to ride knowingly (it appears) into an ambush that killed him.</p>
