<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Some Muslim medical students are refusing to attend lectures or answer exam questions on alcohol-related or sexually transmitted diseases because they claim it offends their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Some trainee doctors say learning to treat the diseases conflicts with their faith, which states that Muslims should not drink alcohol and rejects sexual promiscuity.</p>
<p>A small number of Muslim medical students have even refused to treat patients of the opposite sex. One male student was prepared to fail his final exams rather than carry out a basic examination of a female patient.</p>
<p>The religious objections by students have been confirmed by the British Medical Association (BMA) and General Medical Council (GMC), which both stressed that they did not approve of such actions.</p>
<p>It will intensify the debate sparked last week by the disclosure that Sainsbury&rsquo;s is permitting Muslim checkout operators to refuse to handle customers&rsquo; alcohol purchases on religious grounds. It means other members of staff have to be called over to scan in wine and beer for them at the till.</p>
<p>Critics, including many Islamic scholars, see the concessions as a step too far, and say Muslims are reneging on their professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>This weekend, however, it emerged that Sainsbury&rsquo;s is also allowing its Muslim pharmacists to refuse to sell the morning-after pill to customers. At a Sainsbury&rsquo;s store in Nottingham, a pharmacist named Ahmed declined to provide the pill to a female reporter posing as a customer. A colleague explained to her that Ahmed did not sell the pill for &#8220;ethical reasons&#8221;. Boots also permits pharmacists to refuse to sell the pill on ethical grounds.</p>
<p>The BMA said it had received reports of Muslim students who did not want to learn anything about alcohol or the effects of overconsumption. &#8220;They are so opposed to the consumption of it they don&rsquo;t want to learn anything about it,&#8221; said a spokesman.</p>
<p>The GMC said it had received requests for guidance over whether students could &#8220;omit parts of the medical curriculum and yet still be allowed to graduate&#8221;. Professor Peter Rubin, chairman of the GMC&rsquo;s education committee, said: &#8220;Examples have included a refusal to see patients who are affected by diseases caused by alcohol or sexual activity, or a refusal to examine patients of a particular gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that &#8220;prejudicing treatment on the grounds of patients&rsquo; gender or their responsibility for their condition would run counter to the most basic principles of ethical medical practice&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shazia Ovaisi, a GP in north London, said one of her male Muslim contemporaries at medical school failed to complete his training because he refused to examine a woman patient as part of his final exams.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was academically gifted, one of the best students, but gradually he got in with certain Islamic groups and started to become more radical,&#8221; said Ovaisi.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could see there was a change in his personality as time went by. During the final exams he was supposed to treat a female patient in hospital. He refused to do it, even though it would have been a very basic examination, nothing intrusive.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he refused and as a result he failed his exams. I was quite shocked and disappointed about it because I don&rsquo;t see there being anything in our religion that prohibits us from examining male and female patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both the Muslim Council of Britain and Muslim Doctors and Dentist Association said they were aware of students opting out but did not support them.</p>
<p>Dr Abdul Majid Katme, of the Islamic Medical Association, said: &#8220;To learn about alcohol, to learn about sexually transmitted disease, to learn about abortion, it gives us more evidence to campaign against it. There is a difference between learning and practising.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is obligatory for Muslim doctors and students to learn about everything. The prophet said, &lsquo;Learn about witchcraft, but don&rsquo;t practise it&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
