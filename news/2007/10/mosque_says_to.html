<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Toronto mosque is telling Muslims not to say &#8220;Happy Thanksgiving&#8221; or invite friends into their homes for turkey dinner on the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Khalid Bin Al-Walid Mosque says to &#8220;avoid participating&#8221; in dinners, parties or greetings on Thanksgiving because it is a kuffaar, or non-Muslim, celebration.</p>
<p>A two-part article on the mosque Web site says Muslims should also &#8220;stay completely away&#8221; from &#8220;Halloween trick-and treat nonsense,&#8221; Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s, anniversaries, birthdays and Earth Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we bring ourselves to congratulate or wish people well for their disobedience to Allah? Thus expressions such as:Happy Thanksgiving, Happy Birthday, Happy New Year, etc, are completely out,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>In 2003, the Khalid mosque, which mainly serves the Toronto Somali-Canadian community, apologized for a newsletter that compared wishing someone a Merry Christmas to congratulating a murderer.</p>
<p>At the time, a junior employee was blamed for the slight, but the mosque&rsquo;s Web site has since posted similar edicts covering not only Christmas but also virtually every other Western celebration.</p>
<p>Muslims who participate in the holidays are termed ignorant and hypocritical.</p>
<p>While not all are religious holidays, the Internet site says Muslims are required to be different from non-Muslims &#8220;in matters which are representative of them or are characteristic of their identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also banned, it says, are: watching sports or soap operas, walking dogs, family photos, wedding bands, Western hats, mingling and shaking hands with the opposite sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allah and his messenger have warned us against following or imitating non-Muslims in things which are characteristic of their religion or beliefs. This is more emphasized in the case of their eids [festivals] or occasions, which always hold some religious or ideological non-Islamic meanings, and on which the kuffaar indulge in many evil practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Web site also has a question-and-answer section, which advises that Muslims can join political parties only if they are &#8220;able to exert some influence on the direction of the party so that it will take an Islamic direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Q&A; section, it says that, &#8220;with strong determination and patience, the world will God-willing be under the Muslims&rsquo; control.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mosque is run by a federally registered charity. Rival factions within the Somali Muslim community are fighting in court for control of the charity. The mosque president could not be reached yesterday.</p>
