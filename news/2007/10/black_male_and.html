Columbia University&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health</p>
<p>According to a study conducted at Columbia University&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations, blacks and Latinos do not have more mental disorders than whites. Based on the theory that stress related to prejudice would increase risk for mental disorders, researchers typically expect that black lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals face prejudice related to both racism and homophobia and therefore would have more disorders than their white counterparts. Contrary to this expectation, however, the Mailman School study found that black lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals had significantly fewer disorders than white individuals. Latinos had a prevalence of disorders similar to whites. The findings will be reported in the November 2007 American Journal of Public Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest that black lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals have effective ways to cope with prejudice related to racism and homophobia&#8221; noted Ilan H. Meyer, PhD, associate professor of clinical Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study.</p>
<p>The study of 388 white, black and Latino New York City residents aged 18–59 who identified themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual is the first population-based study of its kind to examine the prevalence of mental disorders among black and Latino, versus white, lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals.</p>
<p>By contrast to the findings about mental disorders, more black and Latino gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals than whites reported a history of serious suicide attempts. &#8220;Because these suicide attempts occurred at an early age, typically during the teenage, we can speculate that they coincided with a coming-out period and were related to the social disapprobation afforded to lesbian, gay, and bisexual identities,&#8221; Dr. Meyer said. The findings were consistent with the notion that these problems may be more potent among lesbians, gay men, and bisexual youth in Latino and other communities of color. &#8220;In the absence of higher prevalence of mood disorders in this population, these findings pose challenge to mental health professionals&#8221; said Dr. Meyer. &#8220;If this is indeed the case, public health professionals should address what prevention efforts are required to reduce suicide risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths in these communities&#8221; Dr. Meyer said.</p>
<p>The study also found that, across all race/ethnic groups, younger cohorts of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (those in age groups 18–29 and 30–44 as compared with 45–59 years old) had lower prevalence of almost all mental disorders categories, and the difference was statistically significant for mood disorders. Younger cohorts also had fewer serious suicide attempts than did older cohorts (but this was statistically significant only for the middle cohort).</p>
<p>&#8220;The finding regarding younger cohorts of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals is consistent with social stress theories that predicted that the liberalization of social attitudes toward homosexuality over the past few decades can lead to a decline in stress and related mental disorders and suicide among lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals&#8221; said Dr. Meyer.</p>
<p>In other findings, the study reported that bisexual identity was related to higher prevalence of substance use disorders but not of anxiety or mood disorders and it confirmed previous observations that among gay populations, men and women do not differ substantially in disorder prevalence.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>

					<p>With all the problems in the world today   &mdash;   in this country today   &mdash;   this maniacal group from higher education focuses on something whacked out like this.  No wonder we&rsquo;re falling apart at the seams.</p>
<p>If true which I highly doubt it is, the difference is more likely based on the fact that whites are held to a higher standard than minorities.  Therefore, the burden is greater for them!<br>

					<p>&#8220;Black homosexuals have better mental health than white homosexuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such an honor, as well as a vitally important statistic.  This should make the national talk topic for about a month on all the stations.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they might want to erect (If you&rsquo;ll pardon the pun) a statue of one of their heroes.</p>

					<p>This is laughable.  Columbia finally tackles the race issue and this is what they study.  </p>
<p>I wonder how they define mental disorder?  Because according to many liberals, racism is a mental disorder. Some liberals define racism as any opinion that deviates from liberal doctrine.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that they have redefined grooming and stalking behavior as a sign of the best mental health!</p>
<p>And why should those people not be having lower stress levels and disorders? Everything in their &#8220;host nation&#8221; supports them. No request is too absurd &hellip; including alone time in schools with strangers children.</p>
<p>Personally I have seen five mental health professionals in my life in the mistaken belief that they actually care and have helpful information for people who are feeling down or need some guidance. Out of that number three womyn made passses at me. I reported it to their minders and they couldn&rsquo;t have cared less.</p>
<p>These trust mongers are not for white straight people. I say if you can&rsquo;t know anything about the personal belief systems of people you are asking questions of then you have no idea if what they are suggesting to you is even logical or valid for you personally.</p>
<p>White people have the highest mental disorders &hellip; better check the new manual under the heading of &#8220;Whiteness Disorders.&#8221;</p>

					<p>I can tell you for a fact: I never chose to be &#8220;gay&#8221; or homosexual. I have three loving brothers   &mdash;   all of whom are heterosexual and who plan to have large families. We are white and my brothers&rsquo; girlfriends are white too. Thankfully, they love me. We are not a White Supremacist family, but we are what you would call &#8220;racially aware&#8221;. </p>
<p>I tried to force myself to date women, but it never worked as the attaction wasn&rsquo;t there. After awhile, I decided not to have children at all because - if there&rsquo;s a chance that being gay is hereditary - I don&rsquo;t want to pass it down to another generation.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think we gay people are nature&rsquo;s way of purifying the white race. As it turns out, I have always had more health problems than my brothers when we were growing up&hellip;I think all of the bad genes went to me (the least likely to reproduce) and all of the better one&rsquo;s went to them. But I AM the best-looking of all my brothers! <span class="caps">LOL. </span></p>

<p>It could very well be there is a correlation between sexual orientation and general health (mental and physical).  Homosexual behavior in both males and females is now believed by most authorities to have both genetic and prenatal as well as environmental factors involved in its formation.  The evidence certainly leans in that direction.</p>
<p>http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/551076/sexual_orientation_of_men_determined_before_birth/index.html?source=r_health</p>

<p>Since homosexual behavior is &#8220;abnormal&#8221; (it&rsquo;s neither typical or average in any major human population) it&rsquo;s entirely possible that variants (alleles) in hereditary factors producing it might also produce other effects (some undesirable) as well.</p>
<p>There is a high, positive correlation between lesbianism and polycystic ovarian syndrome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256D55004E57FD" rel="nofollow">http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256D55004E57FD</a></p>
<p>Lesbians also seem to get breast cancer much more often than heterosexual women.</p>
<p>http://www.gaysouthafrica.org.za/lesbian/breastc.asp</p>
<p>Up until 1973 the American Psychiatric Association officially classified homosexuality as a mental illness.  It changed that not due to any &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; but merely because of pressures from the homosexual lobby (though interestingly they still classify it as a &#8220;gender identity disorder&#8221;).</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements#1969_-_1974" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements#1969_-_1974</a></p>
<p>As any psychologist will tell you, many types of mental illness have high rates of co-morbidity.  For example: there is a high rate of co-morbidity between social anxiety disorder and panic disorder.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Anxiety_Disorder#Comorbidity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Anxiety_Disorder#Comorbidity</a></p>
<p>Homosexuals are far more likely to commit suicide than heterosexuals.  Gay rights advocates will be quick to blame &#8220;homophobia&#8221; for this phenomenon, and while it may indeed explain part of it, it&rsquo;s interesting to note no one is willing to even entertain a possible biological explanation as well.</p>

<p>Homosexual behavior offers the individual no evolutionary advantage and is actually a detriment to the species as a whole, since homosexual males at least, act as a reservoir to a host of <span class="caps">STD</span>s.</p>

					<p>Until the psychologists address the mental disturbances that cause Whites to imagine that Blacks are equal in the face of all evdence to the contrary, they have nothing worth saying.  Until they investigate the reason that 90% of Black/White couples are Black males and fair-haired females, why this disparity exists, they have nothing to say.  Until they can explain how Whites can support their own disposession by lawless foreigners, they know nothing worth hearing.  Until they have examined the mechanism that allows people to praise diversity, yet put their kids in private schools, they are too ignorant to be allowed to speak in adult company.  Which is why, I gather, that they spend their time on childish thngs.</p>

					<p>The conclusion is: homossexuality is a mental disorder if it occurs in whites, but is not a mental disorder if it occurs in blacks&hellip;</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s see how liberal science works. The expectations of the &#8220;the stress related to prejudice&#8221; theory don&rsquo;t pan out, so do we count this as evidence against, and discard the theory? Of course not. In liberal science, theories about matters like race cannot be altered on the basis of anything so flimsy as contradictory evidence. After all, the moral and political certitudes of liberal thought trump fact.</p>
<p>Instead, contradictory evidence only serves to illustrate the extraordinary fortitude of non-white people, who, in certain spheres of life such as athletics and homosexuality, are able to overcome the hardships of prejudice, and surpass their white oppressors. In other spheres of life, such as academic success, economic success, intellect, and the ability to resist criminal behavior, drug use, parental delinquency, etc. non-white people are forced down by the invisible hand of prejudice. The logic is unassailable. If non-whites fail, it proves that prejudice is at work. If non-whites succeed, it illustrates the extraordinary nobility of non-whites to overcome prejudice. It&rsquo;s the liberal&rsquo;s &#8220;Heads I win, tails you lose,&#8221; principle applied to science.</p>

					<p>&#8220;I can tell you for a fact: I never chose to be &ldquo;gay&rdquo; or homosexual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noone chooses same-sex attractions, but you do choose whether to act on them, and therefore feed them, or to seek help to reduce them and develop opposite-sex attractions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to force myself to date women, but it never worked as the attaction wasn&rsquo;t there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you in a long-term relationship?  What will you do when the steamy romance is gone? Will that be a reason to seek another partner?</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m not trying to be preachy, I&rsquo;m just curious.  I know men who say they have tried monogamy, but it never worked.  They think it is okay to live a playboy lifestyle because that is what comes naturally to them.  Others say it is very difficult and unnatural, but they do it anyway because it is the right thing to do.  How are they different from you?  Please explain.  I just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>All of them do.  What I hate more are liberals in position of power (teaching, for example) and always have to rub their agenda in their classrooms. I&rsquo;ve learned if people are really confident with their beliefs, then they&rsquo;d not need to get so nasty and snobbish towards dissenters like liberals do.  Liberals have a big chip on their shoulder.</p>

<p>So maybe you could just choose to not have heterosexual relations?  Good luck with that when you try it. ;)</p>
<p>People, come on, we are all racially-aware adults here.  Let&rsquo;s stick to the main topic of this website, and let&rsquo;s all of us, homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, etc., stick together.  After all, we know that, contrary to what the Far Left tells us, diversity is <span class="caps">NOT </span>our strength&hellip;UNITY is our strength!!!!</p>

					<p>Okay, i am just going to include what i myself think of the homosexual issue. i believe there are at least two kinds, biological and confusion, the biologicals are those that have always been that way, like being born with any other type of disorder, this is no different though of course still an abnormality, I&rsquo;d speculate the biologicals are those more prone to be more like the opposite sex, that is, i believe the &#8220;lesbians&#8221; who are rather masculine and the &#8220;gays&#8221; that are rather feminine, are the ones truly afflicted, i believe such conduct is evidence of which, since their minds are thinking more in the direction of the sex they should be attracted to and as recent studies have shown, they will physically have some vague characteristics of that opposite sex, it may seem irelavent but heres some right here. typically, a mans ring finger is longer than his index, and the female index is longer than her ring, it has been found that many lesbians and gays have that of the opposite sex, rather than their own, which shows to me a definite biological cause to some. then there is confusion, or rather having a synthetic interest in the same sex, which is more like a fetish you&rsquo;ll sooner or later grow tired of, than true biological homosexuality. I believe in either case homosexual marriages shouldn&rsquo;t be encouraged and all the usual liberal mantra, because you shouldn&rsquo;t encourage something abnormal. As some may be &#8220;offended&#8221; by that, sorry, but I&rsquo;m simply speaking what i believe to be the hard truth. though i suppose I&rsquo;ve wandered away from the racial slant of the article haven&rsquo;t i? got a bit caught up there. for the actual theme of the article, i saw they once again tried to somehow still blame racism.</p>

<p>Or perhaps &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;homophobia&#8221; aren&rsquo;t as big contributers as you once thought (hoped) they were? they seem to adamantly refuse to give up &#8220;prejudism&#8221; as an excuse, no matter how their actual results vary, &#8220;If they aren&rsquo;t more mentally unstable do to &#8220;prejudism&#8221; then they simply must be adept at dealing with it!&#8221; time moves on, and the fabric of common sense continues to deteriorate more and more&hellip;</p>

					<p>I think this can be partially explained by the fact that homosexuality is much less common amongst whites than blacks.  White homosexuals (who are more likely to have grown up in conservative Christian families) are very likely to feel ashamed and alienated from their families.  The natural result of this is mental disorders and suicidal feelings.  Compare this to a black culture where anything goes and there are no moral constraints combined with the fact that (according to some studies) up to half of all black men are closet homosexuals.  In other words, homosexuality (on the down low) is accepted in black culture, thus black homosexuals are unlikely to feel ashamed or suicidal.  Just look at the cover of any of the &#8220;hip hop&#8221; magazines that are so popular with black male youths; there is often a homoerotic picture of a rapper with his shirt off and pants sagging well below his hips.  </p>

Chances are far better it was because of her struggles with alcoholism, rather than anything else, but still, this whole article is just so&hellip;inane.</p>

					<p>&#8220;So maybe you could just choose to not have heterosexual relations? Good luck with that when you try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The point is, when you choose to indulge these desires, they grow stronger.  Sex is not like eating or drinking, doing without won&rsquo;t kill you.  My husband had to do without for months while I was studying for the bar, and he was no worse for it, maybe better.  Anyway, what you do in your own privacy is not really my business.  Unlike most conservatives, I do believe there is a constitutional right to privacy.  </p>
<p>However, I would not like to have gays and lesbians discourage my children from seeking help and trying to overcome it if they ever have same-sex attractions.  I don&rsquo;t like the advertising of gay sex that goes on in &#8220;sex-ed&#8221; or &#8220;pride parades.&#8221;  I think it was very, very wrong for gay activists to pressure the <span class="caps">APA </span>into removing homosexuality from the <span class="caps">DSM. </span> Now, it is impossible to get funding to explore possible cures for the condition, all to make gays feel better.  Of course, the <span class="caps">AIDS </span>epidemic, and all those dead gay men was the proximate result.</p>
<p>I think you are right to point out that we should be unified.  I do not consider you any less white for being gay.  You are as much my kin as any other white person, and it doesn&rsquo;t sound like you&rsquo;re a radical.  Christ came for sinners not the righteous, and that includes you and me.</p>
<p>&#8220;typically, a mans ring finger is longer than his index, and the female index is longer than her ring, it has been found that many lesbians and gays have that of the opposite sex, rather than their own, which shows to me a definite biological cause to some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the science indicates that there may be some biological risk factors for homosexuality, none of them are causative.  For example, it is well-known that gay men are more likely to be later-born sons than the general population.  This is not environmental because it only applies if the <span class="caps">MOTHER </span>has born sons before the gay subject.  In other words, older males in the house, like cousins, uncles, or adoptive brothers, do not increase the risk of homosexuality.  It appears that there may be something about the hormonal prenatal environment that is different for sons with older brothers born of the same mother.  </p>
<p>However, it must be remembered that the vast majority of later-born sons are not gay.  Therefore, it is at most a contributing risk factor, not a cause.  </p>
<p>What is troubling about homosexuality for whites as a race is that acceptance of homosexuality tends toward an acceptance of childlessness.  It divorces (loaded terminology intentional) sex and romantic partnership from reproduction.  The most frightening thing about the gay rights movement is not so much that it may encourage more men to become homosexual, though this is certainly true as is very evident from ancient Greece and the thoroughgoing homosexualization of that pagan culture.  Rather, the primary threat is that it encourages heterosexual men to reject traditional fatherhood and bread-winner responsibilities.  If men who have sex with men are entitled to all the perks of casual sex and/or domestic and sexual partnerships without the burden of child-rearing, then why are straight men not entitled to the same?  The next thing you know, 28 year old men are having vasectomies.  (Did anyone see that article on msn.com yesterday?  Of course, he was white.)</p>
<p>Racially conscious homosexual whites could go a long way toward improving their image by standing up for traditional family values, distancing themselves from the gay rights activists, and supporting research into prevention and/or therapy.  </p>

					<p>&#8220;none of them are causative&#8221; oh really? than explain why so many of them have such a rare characteristic, can you? its obviously linked in some way, of course almost exclusively to those who were actually born with the condition, rather than the fools who confuse themselves into thinking they do. (note the rise in homosexuality after its general acceptance into society, ask yourselves, were there nearly as many in the 50&rsquo;s?, i think since its so unabashedly shoved in our faces, this is causing more people to actually trick themselves into it, through a gradual process) </p>
<p>Point being a good portion of them are biologically that way, again this isn&rsquo;t to say im for it, just pointing out a portion of its roots, do i think it can be corrected? most certainly, and there may be more research done into such than you think, a touter of the info on the finger hypothesis is a gay man who wrote a book on such characteristics, that he did is beside the issue, the man is &#8220;worried&#8221;,to quote his very wording, that since science has found such links and are investigating a biological cause, that they could perhaps come up with a cure for the disorder, to put it bluntly. It was funny really to think about, this man of course actually wanted his abnormality to continue on and was afraid of any kind of treatment against it. why do many cling so to it? my guess is because its touted as being &#8220;normal&#8221; (stupidly), id guess the same would be true if any other disorder was preached as being so. but another problem caused by the liberal mantra.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racially conscious homosexual whites could go a long way toward improving their image by standing up for traditional family values, distancing themselves from the gay rights activists, and supporting research into prevention and/or therapy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which would only work on those that are simply fooling themselves. those of the biological segment would need medicine, in my opinion.</p>

					<p>Interesting article, totally useless information, but the poster&rsquo;s comments were good to muse over.</p>
<p>Points to be made:</p>
<p>As historians have long noted, Blacks are basically &#8216;grown-up children&rsquo;. American Statesmen, Livingstone in Africa, social data collectors (some of whom put into print their observations as fiction, which still resonates, 100 years later) from the pens of Lothrop Stoddard, Tom(?)Dixon, Jr,all the way down to Herrnstein and Murray, have noted the gap between black and white- in culture, in racial mores, and most importantly, in IQ scores, which breaks down to declaring one group to possess a less developed mind- in short, a mind that is not &#8216;adult,&rsquo; or at least,is far more childish in its&rsquo; ability to make decisions, think through choices,and to make <span class="caps">MORAL </span>distinctions. A more &#8216;selfish, self-centered, self-justifying&rsquo; mind, <span class="caps">IOW.</span></p>
<p>Whites, <span class="caps">OTOH, </span>are possessed with an innate sense of right and wrong, that only <span class="caps">SEVERE </span>indoctrination via the Public Schools can efface. (And they <span class="caps">HAVE </span>been successful in that, no doubt about it!) Part of that moral awareness is due to their [white&rsquo;s] higher <span class="caps">IQ, </span>part is cultural, and a large part could be (and, as a cleric I have to lean to this) a &#8216;covenantal responsibility&rsquo; that is &#8216;bred in the bone,&rsquo; passed down to the members of the religious &#8216;in-group&rsquo; showing God&rsquo;s favor to those &#8216;on whom his favor rests.&rsquo; [Lk. 2:14] In short, European, White Christian culture and her peoples.</p>
<p>Pagan African societies have long indulged in sodomy, bestiality, cannibalism, fetishistic and animistic forms of aberrant sexuality and bodily masochistic behaviors, and think nothing of it- even to this day (the AR report of blacks finding virgin girls to rape to &#8216;cure&rsquo; <span class="caps">AIDS, </span>is just one example of this mindset).</p>
<p>Christian White Europe [otoh] has <span class="caps">LONG </span>been repugnant to the grossest of these perversions, and has, via the Decalogue, and at least since Justinian&rsquo;s Institutes (acting as a model after the fall of Rome) White societies have sought to curb these evils, as they appear in a &#8216;christian society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Finally, it could be that the &#8216;chayed&rsquo; or &#8216;two-legged beast&rsquo; in the Hebrew OT is of a different &#8216;kind&rsquo; than the &#8220;Adam&#8221; created by God, with a corresponding <span class="caps">LACK </span>of that which makes &#8220;Adamkind&#8221; unique. Self-cosncious Jews have observed this in their talmud for over 1500 years. Some may find this morally abhorrent, but it is merely pointing out that Scripture (and even those who deny it) has categories for all, which includes descriptions of those not &#8216;sons of the Covenant.&rsquo; And Christianity, even to this day, still is considered a &#8216;white man&rsquo;s religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason black sodomites (one thinks of that 1970&rsquo;s icon of sissiness, &#8220;Sylvester&#8221;) have no problems with their sexual perversions, is that they possess NO innate moral consciousness, unlike Whites. Whites have to &#8216;supress the truth in unrighteousness,&rsquo; as St. Paul says, while even [sic] Black Christian Pastors indulge in the&hellip; how do they say it&hellip;. &#8216;down low,&rsquo; and excuse &#8216;theyselves&rsquo; as just &#8216;being natural.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As older English novels of class and culture in a Whiter, saner era noted, &#8220;Breeding will out&hellip;.&#8221;. In this case, it would seem, in &#8216;spades.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;And be ye not unequally yoked&hellip; come out of her, my people, lest ye be partakers of her sins.&#8221;- Holy Bible</p>

<i>&ldquo;These findings suggest that black lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals have effective ways to cope with prejudice related to racism and homophobia&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my theory (for which I will be applying for a large grant).</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have or need &#8220;effective ways&#8221; to cope with prejudice related to racism and homophobia because there is little to none racism and homophobia.</p>
<p>And if White gays are experiencing mental illness related to stress, that&rsquo;s understandable because Whites <span class="caps">ARE </span>under stress from multiCULTuralism.<br>

					<p>If stress and anxiety experienced by homosexuals was allegedly previously due to societal nonacceptance, just watch it make a big time comeback upon all manner of perverts and their self-hating white Left-Liberal sponsors, if Sharia Law ever does succeed in taking hold in the western world.  (Chuckle, chuckle!)  They had better pray that that never happens.</p>
<p><i>Contrary to this expectation, however, the Mailman School study found that black lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals had significantly fewer disorders than white individuals.</i></p>
<p>What this pseudo Left Liberal piece of propaganda is inferring by innuendo, is that it is white <b>heterosexual</b> men and women who are supposingly likely to be <i>more</i> prone to mental disorders than the adherents of Sodom and Gomorrah lifestyles.  If indeed <i>whites</i>, (meaning, of course, heterosexual whites), suffer more from mental disorders then it must be as a result of perverted Left Liberal propaganda now manifest and recognisable as <b>heterophobia</b> - what else!</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;These findings suggest that black lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals <b>have&gt;/b&gt; effective ways to cope with prejudice related to racism and homophobia&rdquo; noted Ilan H. Meyer, PhD, associate professor of clinical Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study.</b></i></p>
<p>Yes and we know exactly what these <i>effective ways</i> are. Being allowed to scream accusations of homophobia and racism at people, to be precise.<br>

					<p>   I worked routes in black neighborhoods for nearly fifteen years, worked in plants where they were the majority workforce . Take my word for it, the blacks have their share of nut cases . If a certain denigrating lifestyle,whether it&rsquo;s some form of promiscuity or just anarchy and general lawlessness doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother them,it is probably because as a whole they have little conscience .</p>

					<p>I haven&rsquo;t known many black gays, but they strike me as sexual gays.  Their sex life is seperate from the rest of their life, even if live with a partner.  Sex is sex. The rest of their life is normal. </p>
<p>But so many White gays are all wound up in the gay life style and gay politics and identifying themselves by their sex life and carrying on about everything from a sexual viewpoint. T</p>
<p>hey also have hitched on to all sorts of movements that have nothing to do with sex.  Extremist environmental activities, violent anti Americanism, hatred of White people even though they are White themselves, anti nuclear power, anti oil and gasoline socialism and communism, witchcraft, neo paganism etc.</p>
<p>Lesbians are often into extreme animal rights activities.  They seem to worship animals.  Of course it is sublimation of normal motherhood instincts.</p>
<p>It seems to me that many White gays are seriously disturbed people whose gay sex life is just part of their mental disorder, liberalism.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Homosexual behavior offers the individual no evolutionary advantage&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I disagree.It is one of  natures birth controls. I am a gay white male from a family with several genetic diseases, some pretty bad. My sister is unable to have children. I will never father any, as I am unattracted to the opposite sex. Nature isn&rsquo;t kind when she insures that genetics will make no mistake.</p>

					<p>I recall reading a book by a Black author on the subject of homosexual intercourse in the Black community and Black culture. The author stated that many successful, straight and even married Black men choose to have sex with other black males, usually co workers. He concluded that this was the reason that many married Black men have <span class="caps">AIDS HIV.</span> The book was advertised on &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; news a while ago. I will post the title on here once I find it.</p>

<p>Homophobia in the Black community is usually based on masculinity. ie: it&rsquo;s ok for a Black man to have gay sex. But, he cannot be the one being penetrated. one of Mugabe&rsquo;s senior officials was also in a row over bisexuality.<br>

					<p>&#8220;Black men suffer the highest rates of <span class="caps">HIV </span>infection in Alabama. However, little is known about the <span class="caps">HIV </span>risks of this sector of the population, primarily because the current public health focus is on women and children. The dearth of research on <span class="caps">HIV </span>risk among black men in Alabama is addressed by drawing on focus group, elicitation, and key informant data from an ongoing epidemiologic study on <span class="caps">AIDS </span>in that state. These hypothesis-generating qualitative interviews were used to identify three high-risk scenarios: &#8220;sex for money or drugs&#8221;; &#8220;prison sex&#8221;; and &#8220;sneaky sex&#8221; by married or nominally heterosexual men. It was found that covert and unprotected sex among bisexually active black men was commonplace for reasons that included prostitution, habituation to same-sex relations during incarceration, and the desire to maintain a facade of heterosexuality in homophobic communities. It was concluded that bisexual activity is highly correlated with secrecy and unprotected sex. The risks of bisexuality among black men are exacerbated by incarceration, homophobia, drug use, and the prison and public health focus on surveillance rather than prevention, [black men, bisexuality, <span class="caps">AIDS,</span> Alabama]&#8221;</p>

					<p>When I was in a college in NY with a large african American community. &#8220;Gay Sex&#8221; and Bi sexuality had a high acceptance rate amongst young Black males. In fact, during Speech class an African American student gave a lecture about sex and handed out condoms. He also made reference to how he, and many of his friends had gay sex. He had alot of African American friends in school and none of the other Black students in the class objected to his statements.   </p>

					<p>Young Black males are more exposed to Homosexual sex. Because of their extremely high rate of incarceration. </p>
<p>I am not trying to be offensive. But, if there is an epedemic of prison rape and mostly Black males are in the prisons. Then statisically there would be greater exposure  of Young Black males to homosexual sex.</p>
