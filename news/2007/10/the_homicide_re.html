						<p>Two LAPD South Bureau homicides last night</p>
<p>LAPD 77th Street Division: A black man probably in his 50s was shot and killed near the intersection of West 59th Street and Estrella Avenue at about 11:50 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 15. Officers responding to a radio call of a shooting in this cul-de-sac found him lying dead in the middle of the street, said LAPD Lt. Lyle Prideaux. People nearby had heard an argument, then gunshots. More information to come.</p>
<p>LAPD Southwest Division: Moises Enriquez Arias, 22, a Latino man, was shot and killed by a black man or youth who got out of black Acura-like car in the 2800 block of South Bronson Avenue at about 5:50 p.m. Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Police said Arias was riding a bicycle with a companion just before the shooting. They said the car pulled up and an argument ensued, perhaps after the occupants asked Arias where he was from. One assailant then chased and shot him. The attacker&rsquo;s companion fled. Officers responding to a shooting call found him dead between parked cars. Detectives are seeking information. Dets. Sean Hansen and Chris Luna are at (213) 485-1383.</p>

<p>Victims, Oct. 9-14, 2007</p>
<p>The following series of posts comprises the weekly list of homicide victims in Los Angeles County for this period. A slow week &mdash; until Sunday, that is, when at least seven people were killed, including two in LAPD&rsquo;s Pacific Division, which covers Venice and parts of the Westside, one of the lowest homicide areas in the city. Reports from days past are updated here: The information is from law enforcement, the Los Angeles County coroner, and families. Above, the cousins of Julio Lizano, Echo Park victim from Sunday, light a candle next to the bloodstain on the sidewalk where he fell.</p>

<p>Julio Lizano, 22</p>
<p>Julio Lizano, 22, a Latino young man, was shot multiple times at 2113 W. Sunset Boulevard in Echo Park at about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 14, and died about an hour later at County-USC. Lizano was inside the Brazil tobacco store near Burrito King (below), and had some kind of confrontation with two suspects, said LAPD Northeast Det. Percy Morris.</p>
<p>The suspects walked out, and Lizano did too. The trio faced off again on the sidewalk a few paces from the store, and one of the suspects pulled out a gun and shot Lizano. The suspects then ran on Sunset, and up Alvarado. Lizano had been documented by police as a gang member, but was rumored to have been recently &#8220;jumped out&#8221; &mdash; allowed to part ways with the gang after a ceremonial fight. He wanted to get away from it, and had plans to move out of the neighborhood. Detectives are at (213) 847-4261.</p>

<p>Armando Mariscal, 33, a Latino man, was shot while riding in a car waiting at a traffic light at Lincoln Boulevard and Maxella Avenue on the Westside between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 14. He later succumbed to his injuries. He was the second of two LAPD Pacific Division homicide victims to die in one weekend.</p>
<p>A second person in the group inside the car was wounded, but not seriously, Lt. Richard Mossler said. The group drove a few blocks trying to get Mariscal to a hospital before police and paramedics took over. The incident may have involved an earlier quarrel, investigators said.</p>

<p>Omar Bourdet, 22</p>
<p>Omar Eliceo Bourdet, 22, a Latino man, died at California Hospital early Sunday, Oct. 14, after being shot at a quinceanera party at a rental hall in the 2800 block of East Olympic Boulevard in LAPD&rsquo;s Hollenbeck Division. The shooting took place at about 11:40 p.m. Oct. 13, Det. Gustavo Barrientos of Hollenbeck said.</p>
<p>A brawl had erupted at the party, and spilled outside, where someone pulled out a gun and fired. Bourdet was the only one struck. Other partygoers drove him to California Hospital, left him there and fled, according to detectives. Trauma surgeons were unable to save him. Since doctors had been left in the dark about where their patient had come from, or who had dropped him off, it took some time for police to piece together what happened. Bourdet was the father of an 8-month-old baby, and unemployed, police said.</p>

<p>Elsy Molina, 36, a Latina woman, was found dead in the sleeping area of the tractor-trailer truck she operated in the 2800 block of Victoria in Carson on Friday, Oct. 12, at about 10 a.m., said Sheriff&rsquo;s Lt. Dan Rosenberg. Her throat had been cut. When Molina, who worked alone as a truck driver, did not come home Thursday night, her sisters went to look for her. They found the truck, and Molina inside. She was the mother of as many as three small children. Authorities do not believe she was raped or robbed; it&rsquo;s possible her attacker knew her.</p>

<p>Dekweinte Hunt, 14</p>
<p>Dekweinte Hunt, 14, a black youngster, died some hours after being wounded in a party shooting that also killed 26-year-old Deandre Turner (below), making this Compton incident a double homicide.</p>
<p>The shooting happened at 623 S. Long Beach Blvd. in Compton at about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 11, according to Sgt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County sheriff&rsquo;s homicide bureau. Dekweinte&rsquo;s death at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood occurred at about 10:30 a.m., about eight hours after Turner died. A third victim, a black man or youth, remains hospitalized in serious condition.</p>
<p>Wegener said the victims were at a large party. As the party broke up and people flowed outside, there was an argument, then a shooting. Some gang members were involved in the occasion in some way, police believe, though it was not clear what led to the argument. About 200 people attended the party; not one remained to give information to detectives when they arrived, Wegener said.</p>
<p>Wegener and his partner Det. Richard Biddle are seeking clues of any kind, including anonymous ones. They can be reached at (323) 890-5500.</p>

<p>Another weekend homicide</p>
<p>LAPD Southeast: Guy Scott, 48, a black man, was shot in an alley at 101st and Figueroa streets at about 4:30 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 13, said LAPD South Bureau Det. Sal LaBarbera. Police were called to UCLA-Harbor hospital, where he died. They learned that Scott &mdash; described as a transient &mdash; had stumbled out of an alley where neighbors said he had been sleeping with a gunshot injury, and made it to 102nd and Figueroa where someone called an ambulance for him. Paramedics asked him what happened. He told them he had been shot and pointed to the alley. Those were his last words. He was recently out of prison. (This homicide has not yet been listed by the coroner.)</p>

<p>Dispatch: &lsquo;Like he didn&rsquo;t even exist&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;When does this stop hurting?&#8221; Althea Mizell wailed.</p>
<p>She had begun sobbing while recounting her son&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>It has been almost a year since Marcellus D&rsquo;Angello Mizell, 36, was shot at 57th and Western Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Angello, as his family called him, was &#8220;not an angel,&#8221; his mother said. She recalled the day she learned he&rsquo;d joined the gang: He was standing silhouetted against the light of the kitchen, and she saw a large bump on the back of his head. He had been hit &mdash; jumped into the gang without her knowledge.</p>
<p>They knocked out a couple of teeth too.</p>
<p>After that, he was in and out of jail. No arguments swayed him. &#8220;You are not my mom. The Crips are my mom!&#8221; he had snapped at her during one quarrel. But when he went to jail, she was the one he called.</p>
<p>His long rap sheet included trespassing, drug sales and drug possession. He was never home from prison longer than a year, she said. &#8220;Every one of these white hairs is D&rsquo;Angello,&#8221; his mother said, plucking at gray strands in her brown hair.</p>
<p>She was alone. After two tours in Vietnam, D&rsquo;Angello&rsquo;s father had ended up on the streets. In the early 1980s, he became a homicide victim in Inglewood.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Angello eventually reached the age when she could no longer influence him. So Althea Mizell would unplug her phone at night. It was a small measure of control over the constant dread she felt. &#8220;If he was dead at eleven he would still be dead at five,&#8221; she reasoned.</p>
<p>In the end, the news came by a knock at the door.</p>
<p>He was still alive at the hospital when she got there. He had been shot, execution-style, through the eye, exposing his brains.</p>
<p>When she saw his mangled head, she could go no further than the end of his bed. Her legs wouldn&rsquo;t carry her. An orderly was holding her up. She touched his feet and retreated.</p>
<p>Two days passed. He remained on life support so that his organs could be donated.</p>
<p>Althea Mizell treasures the organ-donor certificate they gave her &mdash; a piece of crisp parchment paper in a blue paper cover. &#8220;It is the proudest thing I have from him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Three people&rsquo;s lives were saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, she has been, as she puts it, &#8220;a mess.&#8221; The pain seems to get worse, not better, she said.</p>
<p>Over and over, she mulls the details of his death, the way his head was blown open, the way he lay for so long on the street.</p>
<p>She is preoccupied with the fact that the case is unsolved.  She talks of not caring whether she dies, and of going to hell so she can find his murderer. &#8220;This is killing me,&#8221; she said, between gasps.</p>
<p>She has a sense that people see him as having had little value, she said. No one has come forward to help solve the case. Even well-meaning friends tell her she should have expected it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s like he didn&rsquo;t even exist,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want anyone to think he didn&rsquo;t matter. He did matter! He was a human being! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want people to know that someone cares about Marcellus D&rsquo;Angello Mizell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcellus D&rsquo;Angello Mizell was killed early on Nov. 19, 2006, at W. 57th Street and Western Avenue. There is a $50,000 reward for information on this homicide. LAPD 77th Street Division detectives are at (213) 485-1383. Photos, Althea Mizell, D&rsquo;Angello, and D&rsquo;Angello&rsquo;s bedroom, last week, which his mother has left untouched since his funeral. His shoes are still lined up against one wall, as they were the day he died.</p>
