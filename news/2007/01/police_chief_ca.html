<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6296789.stm">Police Chief Calls On Communities</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nasreen Suleaman, BBC News, Jan. 24, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The police are considering proposals to share intelligence and information with Muslims before launching anti-terror operations.</p>
<p>The plans, announced by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair, are part of a wider vision to engage more with British Muslims whose support police need in fighting terrorism.</p>
<p>At a conference on Islamophobia, Sir Ian told his largely Muslim audience that combating the threat of extremism and terrorism was something his officers could not do alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not be the police and intelligence services that defeat terrorism, it will be communities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most single important component in the domestic defeat of terror in the next decade is the ability of the police to work with communities to do just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But how easy is that going to be?</p>
<p>A few months after the 7 July attacks, when four British Muslim men killed 52 people in a series of suicide bombings, a senior police officer told me that in the aftermath of the tragic attack the police could ask for whatever help they wanted and Muslims were quick to respond.</p>
<p>That willingness to assist, he said, had since been eroded.</p>
<p>His comments came before the shooting of a man during an anti-terror raid in east London.</p>
<p>That incident further fractured relations between the police and Muslims with the latter angry &mdash; not only with the shooting &mdash; but what they saw as heavy-handed police tactics.</p>
<p><b>Full-time officer</b></p>
<p>As a measure of their seriousness, the police have just appointed a full-time officer to lead their work on community engagement.</p>
<p>Commander Richard Gargini has been in the police service since 1976 and has extensive experience in dealing with high-risk police operations dealing with murder and other serious crime.</p>
<p>But this job could be his most challenging yet.</p>
<p>In his first interview since his appointment, Mr Gargini explained what he intends to do to heal the rift and restore trust.</p>
<p>He says that the next 12 months will be crucial in broadening and strengthening the links with Muslim communities.</p>
<p>One of his key tasks, and perhaps a controversial one, is to develop a policy whereby Muslims will be consulted before an anti-terror raid happens.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Influential leaders&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;What we intend to do is invite selected, influential leaders from the Muslim community to come in and assist us when we are planning and dealing with new information &mdash; this has worked extremely well in the black community and the shootings that have taken place amongst black men,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Gargini is referring to Operation Trident, where police tackle gun crime and violence amongst London&rsquo;s African-Caribbean community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly when I was investigating crimes in those communities I could not have done it unless I had the support of community members. It is important and I have personal evidence of that actually working,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Commander Gargini says, under their proposals, in some cases police would share intelligence with some local people and, if necessary, consult them on anti-terror raids in their area.</p>
<p>He would not be drawn on what police might have done differently in the Forest Gate shooting, if they had operated under this proposed guideline.</p>
<p><b>Reassurance</b></p>
<p>But they hope what will happen is that the people they consult will act as spokespeople, to reassure the rest of their community that police action is proportionate and justified.</p>
<p>There are many pitfalls to this plan not least the accusation, perhaps from fellow police officers, that this is interference in police work.</p>
<p>Mr Gargini says it is a valid point but adds: &#8220;What actually matters here are the outcomes and if it delivers a safer community that is the best outcome for everyone&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for what happens if the advice they are given contradicts or conflicts with how the police eventually proceed &mdash; he says that they would not necessarily take the advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we did on occasion say &lsquo;thank you but we do not think that is likely to happen&rsquo; that would be our responsibility not that of the person who came into assist us. So we would control and be fully accountable,&#8221; he said.</p>
