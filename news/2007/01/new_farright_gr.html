<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The European Parliament&rsquo;s first-ever group of right-wing deputies outlined a tough programme on immigration and future enlargement of the European Union, saying that their common basis was to be a &lsquo;union of patriots.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The new group, expected to be officially formed next Monday, will be named &lsquo;Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty&rsquo;, its prospective leader, Euro MP and deputy chief of France&rsquo;s National Front party Bruno Gollnisch told reporters. </p>
<p>Gollnisch, member of the EU parliament since 1989, is waiting for a verdict on charges of questioning the Holocaust. </p>
<p>Europe needed a new policy aimed at &lsquo;reversing the migration flows&rsquo; of immigrants from outside Europe, Gollnisch said, adding: &lsquo;It is racist to have immigrants coming into Europe to do the work that Europeans don&rsquo;t want to do.&rsquo; </p>
<p>He also said that the EU should take a &lsquo;circumspect view against future enlargement&rsquo; of the now 27-member bloc, arguing that further opening up the union&rsquo;s borders could lead to an influx of workers seeking jobs in the member states. </p>
<p>Ironically, the creation of the new 20-member right-wing group became possible only with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU on January 1. </p>
<p>With five Euro MPs from Romania&rsquo;s anti-Roma xenophobic Greater Romania Party and one from Bulgaria&rsquo;s extreme Ataka party, the new group managed to get just the threshold number of deputies needed. </p>
<p>The EU parliament&rsquo;s rules stipulate that an official caucus in the assembly needs a minimum of 19 members. </p>
<p>The diverse group from seven different countries also includes Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France&rsquo;s National Front, Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of the former Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and the leader of Belgium&rsquo;s separatist Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang, Frank Vanhecke. </p>
<p>Another prominent member is Andreas Moelzer, ex-aide of the former pioneer of the modern right, Joerg Haider of Austria. </p>
<p>&lsquo;We want to defend the identity of our nations peacefully and legally,&rsquo; said Gollnisch. He said that the group had chosen to be a &lsquo;union of patriots,&rsquo; a motto heralded by Le Pen. </p>
<p>Gollnisch said his group would work for the interests and the sovereignty of each EU member state and was committed to Christian values &lsquo;and the heritage of Europe&rsquo;s traditional culture.&rsquo; </p>
<p>He also said the new caucus was opposing &lsquo;a single bureaucratic and monolithic European super-state.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The group plans to formally announce its creation in the parliament&rsquo;s full plenary session in Strasbourg next Monday. </p>
<p>From then on, the group will be entitled to EU funding and some positions within the European parliament, such as a vice-presidency of a law-making committee. </p>
<p>Conservative French MEP Joseph Daul, newly-elected leader of the parliament&rsquo;s biggest political group, said Tuesday that the creation of the right-wing caucus was a signal for politicians to watch their messages and not to fuel extremism on the left or the right. </p>
<p>Separately, the leaders of the parliament&rsquo;s green group said that setting up a political organisation would not increase the influence of right-wing Euro MPs in the 732-member EU assembly. </p>
<p>However, such a group would be &lsquo;the antithesis of the very values this parliament stands for,&rsquo; green MEPs Monica Frassoni of Italy and Daniel Cohn-Bendit of Germany added.<br>
