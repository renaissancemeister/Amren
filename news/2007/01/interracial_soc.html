<h1>Interracial Social Networking: Blackenize</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PRWeb Press Release, January 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Back in January 2003, a clever black man, named Byron Veasey, decided to start a new interracial community for black men and white women. He really had no thought of what to call it. This black man, named after the poet, Lord Byron, then went back and re-read some of his posts on another message interracial community, WF4BM.net. He had been a moderator on that forum but wanted an online community that was friendly and supportive. He had posted a humorous story with the name Blackenize. He decided that the word Blackenize had such a strong meaning, he decided to use it for his new community. Blackenize was born. This interracial community for black men and white women went from being an MSN community to becoming Blackenize.com in March 2003. The idea was t o have an online interracial group focused on friendship and being a support group for interracial relationships between black men and white women. He operates the community, with the co-manager, Dee Waller.</p>
<p>In January 2007, a decision was made to not close down the site, but to continue it. A decision was made to turn Blackenize into a web portal. An economic decision was made to change web hosting companies and forum software. The Infopop Eve forum software was dumped for vBulletin. The webhosting co mp any was changed from Groupee/Infopop to SiteGround. The monthly charges to lease the board software and for web hosting of $114 a month now because $4.95 a month. It included 40,000 MB Web space and 900 GB of Traffic.</p>
<p>The migration from Infopop Eve fo rum software to vBulletin took place from January 3rd to January 7th. The vBulletin software was able to import the members and posts from Infopop Eve. But the decision was made to start the board with fresh content rather than bring over 180 mb of pre vio us posts. The migration of the photo albums took place as well. The photo albums from Infopop eve were converted to Photopost PHP Pro. The matchmaking software on the site was converted from Profile Manager Premium to vbMates. Later in 2007, the video voice chat will be migrated from Paltalk to Flashchat.</p>
<p>January 2007 marked the rebirth of Blackenize.com. Inactive members were purged from the membership rolls. 1300 inactive members were terminated and 900 members were now part of the new Blackenize.c om. Veasey and Waller plan to expand the reach of Blackenize.com https://www.blackenize.com and make it a more active community.<br>

								<h2>Man In Schuylkill Jail For More Than 180 Days To Stay Put</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Chris Parker, The Morning Call (Phoenix), Jan. 5, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A New York City man charged with shooting at his ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s new boyfriend through the third-floor kitchen window of the woman&rsquo;s Tamaqua apartment lost his bid to get out of jail Thursday because he faces a new charge of perjury for allegedly lying at a November bail hearing.</p>
<p>Kareem Mills, 24, who faces attempted homicide and related charges in the March 13 shooting, asked Schuylkill County Judge John E. Domalakes to free him because he&rsquo;s been jailed for more than 180 days.</p>
<p>State law says inmates mu st be tried or freed after that amount of time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mills&rsquo; lawyer, public defender Christopher M. Riedlinger, was set to argue that the court could not impose conditions on a defendant&rsquo;s release after 180 days without trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mills faces a preliminary hearing at 11:30 a.m. today before District Judge James K. Reiley, Pottsville, on charges that he lied under oath at his Nov. 28 bail hearing.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit and court testimony, police were called to an apartment at 36 W. Broad St. at 9:08 p.m. on March 13 for a report of a man with a weapon trying to enter an apartment. They were met by Kelly Dalessio, who told them the man was her ex-boyfriend, Mills.</p>
<p>According to police, Dalessio said Mills called her and said he wanted to come to the apartment to get his clothes. She told him he couldn&rsquo;t come there now because she was with her new boyfriend, and that she would bring the clothes out to him, the affidavit said.</p>
<p>She then heard a loud bang, and thought Mills kicked in the door to the main apartment building. She then heard a bang on the kitchen window. Her new boyfriend, Donald Watts, accompanied by Dalessio&rsquo;s two young daughters, went into the kitchen to investigate. Dalessio stayed in a bedroom.</p>
<p>Watts opened the blinds to see M ills point a gun at him, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Mills fired at least once, then came through the shattered window, brandishing the gun, the affidavit says. The girls hid behind a bed and Watts jumped out another window, the affidavit says. Watts w as taken to St. Luke&rsquo;s Miners Memorial Hospital, Coaldale, where he was treated and released.</p>
