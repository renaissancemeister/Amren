<h1>N.S. Protesters Force &lsquo;Race Realist&rsquo; To Cancel Controversial Talk</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Patten, Canadian Press, Jan. 16. 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shouting &#8220;Nazis aren&rsquo;t welcome here,&#8221; a mob of protesters shoved a self-described &#8220;race realist&#8221; from a Halifax hotel conference room Tuesday night where he was about to give a controversial speech.</p>
<p>A couple of dozen people prevented Jared Taylor, who critics have described as a white supremacist, from speaking. Taylor, who argues against the mixing of races, insists he&rsquo;s not a racist and doesn&rsquo;t espouse hatred.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor, a self-described race realist, is surrounded by protesters in Halifax, N.S. on Tuesday. (CP/Andrew Vaughan)</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame on you,&#8221; a young woman shouted at Taylor, a director at the National Policy Institute, a self-described U.S. research group that promotes the separation of the races.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re trying to separate yourself from diversity, separate yourself from people of race, then you are completely ignoring people of colour,&#8221; the woman continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no difference between a white supremacist and a white separatist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident occurred at the Lord Nelson Hotel, where Taylor had booked a room to speak before sending out notices to the media.</p>
<p>The protesters, most of them young and white, surrounded Taylor, destroyed his pamphlets, and replaced them with posters that read: &#8220;Racist scum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two police officers eventually escorted most of them from the hotel. There were no arrests.</p>
<p>A smiling Taylor later posed for photographers, holding the poster.</p>
<p>Hotel management, who said they were unaware the room had been booked by Taylor, told him to cancel the event and offered him a refund.</p>
<p>It appeared only a handful of people actually showed up to hear the speech, including a black university student.</p>
<p>Efrem Gebrehiwet said that while he believes Taylor is &#8220;repugnant,&#8221; he should have been given a fair opportunity to speak &mdash; and be challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we should have been given a chance to shut down his opinions ourselves,&#8221; Gebrehiwet said as he stood among shreds of Taylor&rsquo;s torn-up pamphlets.</p>
<p>Taylor was originally supposed to appear at Dalhousie University for a debate with David Divine, the Halifax school&rsquo;s chair of black Canadian studies.</p>
<p>The university called off the event after concerns were raised about Taylor&rsquo;s beliefs.</p>
<p>Taylor said he was surprised by the demonstration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fully expected to make my remarks,&#8221; he said outside the conference room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve spoken at many universities, many public meetings. Never, ever, have I been prevented from speaking.&#8221;</p>
