<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>In her latest statement to investigators, the accuser in the Duke lacrosse rape case changed her account again about when the alleged gang rape occurred, who attacked her and how.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys filed the statement in court today, arguing that it was more evidence that the woman is an unreliable witness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The statement layers new and contradictory accounts over the woman&rsquo;s previous statements:</p>
<p>* In her latest statement she said the attack ended at midnight.</p>
<p>In previous accounts, the woman said the gang-rape ended shortly before she left in the car driven by Kim Roberts, the second dancer. Roberts called 911 as she was driving away at 12:53 a.m., according to police records. This new account leaves 50 minutes unaccounted between the end of the rape and the departure from the party.</p>
<p>The new statement runs contrary to time stamped photos of the party, which show the two women dancing between 12:00 and 12:04 a.m. in the living room of the house at 610 N. Buchanan Blvd.</p>
<p>* In the latest statement, the woman says she arrived at the party at 11:10 p.m. on March 13 and that the rape began at 11:40 p.m. Her cell phone records show that she was on phone with her father and others up to one minute before the rape allegedly started.</p>
<p>* The woman now said her alleged assailants used multiple names.</p>
<p>In previous accounts, she said she was assaulted by three men named &ldquo;Adam&rdquo;, &ldquo;Brett&rdquo; and &ldquo;Matt.&rdquo; She has given conflicting descriptions of the three men and contradictory accounts of how they assaulted her. </p>
<p>In the Dec. 21 interview, she said for the first time that the players used multiple names. &ldquo;Dan, Adam and Brett was used by Dave Evans,&rdquo; Wilson wrote. &ldquo;Adam and Matt was also used by Reade Seligmann. She does not remember a name being used for Collin Finnerty or if he was called by a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* The accuser has changed her description of Evans. On April 4, she viewed a photograph of Evans and said it looked like one of her assailants, except that the assailant had a moustache. In the Dec. 21 statement, the woman said the assailant had a five o&rsquo;clock shadow, not a moustache. Evans has a visible five o&rsquo;clock shadow in the photograph.</p>
<p>* In her recent statement, the woman said that Evans stood in front of her and made her perform sex on him. In past statements, she said that Seligmann did this.</p>
