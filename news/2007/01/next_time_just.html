<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A Judge stunned his courtroom yesterday with an outspoken attack on the prosecution of a man who racially abused an Asian doctor.</p>
<p>Paul Darlow was hearing the case against Matthew Stiddard, who was charged after calling a police surgeon a &#8220;****ing Paki&#8221;.</p>
<p>The judge condemned the case as &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and said Dr Imraan Jhetam should have let the insult &#8220;roll off his back&#8221;.</p>
<p>When a prosecution lawyer insisted the doctor was entitled to protection from racial abuse, the judge remarked: &#8220;Next time call him a fat bastard and don&rsquo;t say anything about his colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night Dr Jhetam, a South African who is 5ft 4in and 15st, refused to comment.</p>
<p>But colleagues at Devon Police jumped to his defence and said judges should not be undermining the &#8220;dangerous&#8221; job of a police doctor.</p>
<p>Lawyers at Exeter Crown Court were clearly surprised by Judge Darlow&rsquo;s remarks in the case, in which Stiddard had pleaded guilty to causing racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.</p>
<p>The judge said it was inappropriate for the court to be dealing with a verbal insult and that to charge 36-year-old Stiddard for his comments was a &#8220;nonsense&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what this is doing in the Crown Court,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a single sentence to a man who should not have taken it so seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a man of some considerable standing in society and I cannot see that it caused him any distress or hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;To charge it in the first place rather than say let it go by with a caution strikes me as rather odd.</p>
<p>&#8220;We let people hit each other and break into people&rsquo;s homes and they are not charged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutor Ann Reddrop hit back, saying: &#8220;When there is a burglary and it is in the public interest there will be a prosecution. This was a police surgeon and he is entitled to the same protection as anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge replied: &#8220;So next time call him a fat bastard and don&rsquo;t say anything about his colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we have an overstretched police force and an overstretched CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) one wonders why we are sitting here with long faces dealing with one verbal sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court heard that the abusive comments came after Stiddard had spent time in a pub near his home in Dawlish, Devon.</p>
<p>Several police officers arrived and asked him to step outside where, the court heard, he became abusive and aggressive, leading to his arrest for public disorder.</p>
<p>Stiddard was taken to the police station where he later complained of back pains and asked to see a doctor.</p>
<p>When Dr Jhetam arrived, Stiddard shouted: &#8220;**** off you Paki. I want an English doctor, not a ****ing Paki&#8221;.</p>
<p>Judge Darlow gave him a two-year conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £45 towards prosecution costs of £150.</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s police colleagues questioned the wisdom of the judge&rsquo;s comments last night.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man was extremely aggressive to Dr Jhetam, who deserves protection in what can be a difficult and dangerous job,&#8221; said one.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sort of abuse cannot be tolerated and should not be undermined by a judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Judge Darlow defended his remarks last night, saying they were &#8220;not intended to make light of racist remarks&#8221;.</p>
<p>But when &#8220;made by a drunk towards an obviously highly professional, educated and respected member of society in a position of clear authority over the defendant, I found it hard to conceive that it could be taken as seriously upsetting abuse.&#8221;</p>
