<h1>Quebec Man Sentenced To Prison For Racist Website</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CTVA.ca, Jan. 23, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 30-year-old neo-Nazi has become the first man in Quebec history to be sent to prison for promoting hate on the Internet.</p>
<p>Quebec court Judge Martin Vauclair said there is a risk Jean-Sebastient Presseault may offend again, and sentenced him to a six-month prison term Tuesday.</p>
<p>Presseault&rsquo;s website urged hatred against Jews and blacks, and Vauclair stressed he also had a violent history.</p>
<p>Last May, Presseault was arrested for threatening to kill a judge and possessing an illegal handgun.</p>
<p>Crown prosecutor Thierry Nadon had asked for a one-year sentence and said he was disgusted the website&rsquo;s content, which included racist cartoons and songs.</p>
<p>The defence lawyer had asked for a three-month sentence to be served in the community.</p>
<p>But Moise Moghrab of B&rsquo;Nai Brith Canada said the judge&rsquo;s sentence was too lenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Presseault) was actively recruiting hate mongers, so I think six months will not discourage anyone like him from doing another website,&#8221; he told CTV Montreal.</p>
<p>Presseault is only the third Canadian to be sentenced to prison for spreading hatred on the Internet, and Nadon said the courts are too lenient with such crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A maximum of two years is considered one of the least serious crimes in the Criminal Code,&#8221; said Nadon.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we want to send a stronger message, then the maximum should be higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, legal expert Sunny Handa at McGill University argued that law enforcement officials lack the resources to tackle hate websites.</p>
<p>&#8220;The growth is dramatic,&#8221; said Handa. &#8220;And you have to keep in mind the police have not had the growth in budget increases, and the manpower assigned, to keep up with all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presseault leaves behind his wife and two-year-old daughter, but could be eligible for parole within two months.</p>
