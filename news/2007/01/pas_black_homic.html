<h1><a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07030/757911-85.stm">Pa.&rsquo;s Black Homicide Victim Rate Leads Nation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Majors, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Jan. 30, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new analysis of unpublished FBI data shows that the homicide rate among blacks in Pennsylvania ranks as the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>The report, released yesterday by the Violence Policy Center in Washington, D.C., is based on uniform crime reports from 2004 &mdash; the most recent data available from the FBI &mdash; and shows that handguns are used in an overwhelming majority of the homicides.</p>
<p>According to the report, there were 398 black homicide victims in Pennsylvania in 2004 &mdash; 348 male, 50 female. Based on population figures, that is a homicide rate of 29.52 victims per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The states that come closest to Pennsylvania&rsquo;s rate are Louisiana, with 29.48 victims per 100,000; Indiana, with 29.30; and California, with 28.95.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s rate is more than 11/2 times the national average of 18.71 victims per 100,000 people, said Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center and co-author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, the toll that homicide exacts on black teens and young adults in America, both male and female, is disproportionate, disturbing and undeniable,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homicide is the leading cause of death of blacks ages 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 34.</p>
<p>In comparison, homicide ranks as the third-leading cause of death for whites in age groups 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 &mdash; the top two causes are accidents and suicide. Among whites ages 25 to 34, homicide drops to the fifth-leading cause, behind accidents, suicide, cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But according to one expert, there are several factors that need to be kept in mind when considering Pennsylvania&rsquo;s high ranking.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, if you look across the top 10 states, the numbers aren&rsquo;t all that far apart,&#8221; said Alfred Blumstein, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and director of the National Consortium on Violence Research at the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the data for Louisiana has obviously changed since then because [of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005].&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, the study does not include Florida because that state does not submit information to the FBI database.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Blumstein said, &#8220;Philadelphia would be, by far, the largest component of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s statistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Allegheny County medical examiner&rsquo;s office, there were 83 homicides here in 2004. Sixty-three of those victims were black.</p>
<p>In 2003, however, those numbers were much higher. Of the 125 homicides, 92 victims were black.</p>
<p>Last year, Allegheny County had 95 homicides, 74 of them black victims.</p>
