<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6226305.stm">Catalans Grapple With Migrant Influx</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marian Hens, BBC News, Jan. 3, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mohammed Chaib says he is not an example, but he is certainly an exception.</p>
<p>Last November, he became the only Muslim MP elected to the Catalan Parliament &mdash; a unique event in the region and in Spain.</p>
<p>His election came as the debate about immigration in Catalonia and its impact on national identity deepened.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Spain has absorbed around four million immigrants. Just less than a quarter have settled in prosperous Catalonia.</p>
<p>It has been a sudden and dramatic change for Catalans.</p>
<p>And &mdash; as in the rest of Spain &mdash; immigration has become the main concern, ahead of terrorism and unemployment.</p>
<p>But in this region there is an additional element of unease.</p>
<p>Catalonia has recently gained more autonomy with a new statute approved by the Spanish Parliament, and nationalists are worried immigrants will dilute their hard-fought Catalan identity.</p>
<p>Mohammed Chaib arrived in Catalonia as a child some four decades ago.</p>
<p>He says he wants to help Muslim immigrants find a balance between cultures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to promote understanding between the Catalan people and immigrants &mdash; mainly the Moroccans, but also the North Africans and the Pakistanis, who have come in large numbers to Barcelona,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But he is finding that pushing for the integration of Muslims into Catalan life is not an easy task.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Catalans&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suspicion thrives &mdash; as Mr Chaib found during the regional elections in November.</p>
<p>As part of its campaign, the main nationalist party, Convergencia i Unio, suggested that only immigrants who could prove a good knowledge of the Catalan language and Catalan culture should have the same access to social services as other Catalans.</p>
<p>And the party&rsquo;s campaign head stated they favoured recruiting workers from Eastern Europe but not from North Africa because Muslims found it harder to integrate.</p>
<p>Moderates branded these remarks xenophobic.</p>
<p>The nationalists were forced to backtrack. But Mr Chaib remains critical of an attitude he finds still prevails among certain politicians &mdash; and even some employers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they want? To pick and choose immigrants of a certain type &mdash; white with blue eyes? For me this is a really racist message,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they continue along these lines, we will have a problem living together in Catalonia,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where would we draw the line on saying who is Catalan and who isn&rsquo;t? We would create a society of good and bad Catalans. I think this is totally inappropriate.</p>
<p>&#8220;No culture is better than others. What we need to do is identify the positive characteristics of each culture and share them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Message of hope</p>
<p>And that is the agenda of Ibn Batuta &mdash; a cultural centre located in Mr Chaib&rsquo;s constituency, at the heart of the Raval, an immigrant neighbourhood in Barcelona&rsquo;s medieval quarter.</p>
<p>Over the last few years it has experienced something of a renaissance with shops and cafes set up by some of the many newcomers.</p>
<p>Ibn Batuta &mdash; where Mr Chaib is director &mdash; offers Catalan classes, legal advice and even workshops on identity.</p>
<p>He says he is trying to help people in his constituency to fit in. The message he sends out as an elected MP is one of hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;If my presence in the Catalan Parliament can teach young people that you can succeed in politics in Catalonia even if you are an immigrant, then I will be very satisfied,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if Catalan people can see a person called Mohammed, Ahmed or Mustapha and believe they will defend the interests of Catalans equally, I will be really happy.&#8221;</p>
