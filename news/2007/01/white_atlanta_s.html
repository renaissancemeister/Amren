<h1>White Atlanta Suburbs Push For Secession</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Gross, AP, Jan. 23, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A potentially explosive dispute in the City Too Busy to Hate is taking shape over a proposal to break Fulton County in two and split off Atlanta&rsquo;s predominantly white, affluent suburbs to the north from some of the metropolitan area&rsquo;s poorest, black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Legislation that would allow the suburbs to form their own county, to be called Milton County, was introduced by members of the Georgia Legislature&rsquo;s Republican majority earlier this month.</p>
<p>Supporters say it is a quest for more responsive government in a county with a population greater than that of six states. Opponents say the measure is racially motivated and will pit white against black, rich against poor.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it gets to the floor, there will be blood on the walls,&#8221; warned state Sen. Vincent Fort, an Atlanta Democrat and member of the Legislative Black Caucus who bitterly opposes the plan. Fort added: &#8220;As much as you would like to think it&rsquo;s not racial, it&rsquo;s difficult to draw any other conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation calls for amending the Georgia Constitution to allow the return of Milton County, which succumbed to financial troubles during the Depression and was folded into Fulton County in 1932.</p>
<p>The former Milton County is now mostly white and Republican and one of the most affluent areas in the nation. Atlanta and its southern suburbs are mostly black, are controlled by Democrats and have neighborhoods with some of the highest poverty rates in America. (Buckhead, a fashionable Atlanta neighborhood of clubs, restaurants and mansions, would remain in Fulton County.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Milton County would have a population of about 300,000, instantly making it Georgia&rsquo;s fifth-largest county.</p>
<p>Residents of north Fulton represent 29 percent of the county&rsquo;s population of 915,000 but pay 42 percent of its property taxes, according to a local taxpayers group. A split would lead to the loss of $193 million in property taxes alone for Fulton County.</p>
<p>About 25 miles to the south in downtown Atlanta, the Rev. J. Allen Milner said he is afraid the tax revenue loss would have a devastating effect on those who need government help the most.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While other Southern cities erupted in violence a generation ago, Atlanta came through the civil rights movement with little strife, earning the nickname The City Too Busy to Hate. It is now home to one of the nation&rsquo;s largest black middle-class communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure would require the support of two-thirds of both the House and Senate. Then it would have to put to a statewide vote. Also, residents of what would become Milton County would have to endorse the plan.</p>
<p>While Republicans have majorities in both chambers, they would need to win over three Democrats in the Senate and 14 in the House to get it passed.</p>
