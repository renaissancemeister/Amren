<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oprah Winfrey&rsquo;s poke at the short-sighted materialism of some low-income students has delighted conservative commentators, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Liberals love to &#8220;speak truth to power,&#8221; but the powerless need to hear the truth, too. Knowledge, after all, is power. Don&rsquo;t keep it to yourself, I say. Spread it around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Queen of Daytime Talk did poor folks a favor when she candidly explained in a Newsweek interview why she decided to build her lavish new school for impoverished teenagers, the $40 million Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, in South Africa instead of the United States. South Africa&rsquo;s students, she said, show a greater need and appreciation for education, even though American schools are free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I became so frustrated with visiting inner-city schools (in America) that I just stopped going. The sense that you need to learn just isn&rsquo;t there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you ask the kids what they want or need, they will say an iPod or some sneakers. In South Africa, they don&rsquo;t ask for money or toys. They ask for uniforms so they can go to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having reported from South Africa at various times since the 1970s and as the parent of a black American teenager, I agree with Winfrey. She&rsquo;s not blaming the victims. Our kids don&rsquo;t know anything except that which they are taught by parents, peers, teachers and other role models. My folks didn&rsquo;t need college degrees to know that &mdash; as they let me know on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Yet, those sentiments sound so politically incorrect these days that it&rsquo;s easy to understand why Fox News Channel&rsquo;s John Gibson sounded shocked &mdash; Shocked! -at Winfrey&rsquo;s quote. &#8220;Uhh, just asking, but can anybody else in America say that and get away with it?,&#8221; he opined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A similar &#8220;Cosby-esque&#8221; frenzy has swirled up in recent days around Herman Badillo, the first native-born Puerto Rican elected to Congress, for writing in his new book, &#8220;One Nation, One Standard,&#8221; that too many of his fellow Hispanic-Americans are stuck in poverty because they don&rsquo;t value education enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education is not a high priority in the Hispanic community,&#8221; wrote Badillo, 77, a Democrat-turned-Republican and former mayoral candidate. &#8220;Hispanic parents rarely get involved with their children&rsquo;s schools. They seldom attend parent-teacher conferences, ensure that children do their homework, or inspire their children to dream of attending college.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet, instead of discussing the worthy points Badillo raises, many will try to shout him down. Bronx Democratic leader Jos√© Rivera already has blasted Badillo in a New York Post interview as a &#8220;total insult&#8221; to Latino parent-advocates. That&rsquo;s OK, Badillo says. He wanted to stir up a dialogue. The controversy will help him sell a few more books, too. Puerto Ricans certainly are not the only Americans who need to read it.</p>
