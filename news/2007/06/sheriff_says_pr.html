						<p>A police officer is accused of killing his pregnant girlfriend in her home, where furniture was found overturned, bleach spilled on the floor, and her 2-year-old son was left alone, a sheriff&rsquo;s complaint said.</p>
<p>Jessie Davis&rsquo; body was found Saturday in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, still carrying her dead, nearly full-term fetus, a girl she planned to name Chloe.</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo; boyfriend, Canton Police Officer Bobby Cutts Jr., the father of her son, was charged with two counts of murder and due in court Monday. Davis&rsquo; relatives have said they believed Cutts also was the father of her fetus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davis, 26, of Lake Township near Canton, was reported missing after her mother found her grandson home alone, with bedroom furniture toppled and bleach spilled on the floor. The boy, Blake, gave investigators some of their first clues, saying: &#8220;Mommy was crying. Mommy broke the table. Mommy&rsquo;s in rug.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of Cutts&rsquo; former high school classmates, Myisha Ferrell, was jailed for allegedly hindering the investigation and also due in court Monday. She is accused of giving false statements to investigators, according to an inmate biography form.</p>
<p>Ferrell, 29, was arrested and jailed Sunday, but authorities declined to release other information, including whether she had a lawyer.</p>
<p>Also Monday, Davis&rsquo; father, Ned Davis, thanked the thousands of volunteers who helped search for his daughter and said he was overwhelmed with grief.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been, at best, it&rsquo;s been very, very difficult,&#8221; Ned Davis said on NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Today&#8221; show. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe I can really quantify what our family&rsquo;s feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The loss of Jessie has been overwhelming. There are no words,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies and FBI agents with a search warrant broke down the door of Ferrell&rsquo;s apartment Saturday night, agent Scott Wilson said. She was not home during the search.</p>
<p>Justin Lindstrom, 27, an upstairs neighbor of Ferrell&rsquo;s, said officers spent two hours searching the woman&rsquo;s apartment Saturday night before leaving with several full, brown paper bags and bottles of bleach from the basement. Authorities would not describe what the deputies seized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cutts also has a 9-year-old daughter with another woman, Nikki Giavasis, who now lives in Los Angeles. The two lived together for awhile, but when she began seeing another man in 1998, Cutts was accused of breaking into her home while she was inside with former NBA player Shawn Kemp of the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Cutts pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge and was sentenced to three years&rsquo; probation. Giavasis told police she feared for her safety. The pair are involved in a custody dispute.</p>
<p>Giavasis told The Associated Press they were together about four months, and confrontations began after she broke off their relationship. Giavasis said the two had several physical confrontations.</p>
