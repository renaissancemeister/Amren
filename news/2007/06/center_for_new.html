						<p>For Immediate Release<br>
June 20, 2007</p>
<p>Center for New Community Releases &#8220;Indecent Proposals: Top 10 Most Offensive Quotes&#8221; from Anti-Immigrant Groups and Supporters</p>
<p>Members of Congress Urged to Disavow Virulent Rhetoric from Extremist Groups As Reform Effort Nears Homestretch</p>
<p>Today, the Center for New Community, a faith-based human rights group that tracks anti-immigrant activity, released &#8220;Indecent Proposals: Top 10 Most Offensive Quotes from Anti-Immigrant Leaders.&#8221; The list captures some of the most offensive rhetoric being propagated and endorsed by anti-immigrant groups and their supporters on talk radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;This nation desperately needs informed, reasoned debate on this issue,&#8221; said Rev. David Ostendorf, executive director of the Center for New Community.  &#8220;The anti-immigrant groups and their supporters are clearly not interested in helping our nation move forward &mdash; all anyone has to do is turn on the radio to hear that these groups&rsquo; values do not represent the values shared by the vast majority of Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Congress reintroduces this legislation, we urge all members, regardless of where they stand on the particulars of the bill, to clearly and forcefully denounce and distance themselves from these groups and their baneful rhetoric which has no place in our public square,&#8221; he finished.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the &#8220;Top 10 Most Offensive Quotes from Anti-Immigrant Leaders&#8221; and their supporters.  The list is also available at http://www.buildingdemocracy.com/</p>
<p>WARNING: Graphic, offensive and otherwise inappropriate language follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Indecent Proposals: Top 10 Most Offensive Quotes from Anti-Immigrant Leaders&#8221;</p>
<p>1.) &#8220;We need the National Guard to clean out all our cities and round them up&hellip;. They have no problem slitting your throat and taking your money or selling drugs to your kids or raping your daughters, and they are evil people.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p>Chris Simcox, co-founder of the Minuteman Project and president of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.  As quoted in the <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy"><cite>Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Intelligence Report</cite></a> magazine, Summer 2005.</p>
<p>2.) &#8220;Mexican men have a reputation for leering and worse at little girls, which shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us, since sex with children is socially acceptable in Mexico.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p>Brenda Walker, California anti-immigrant leader and publisher.  From VDARE.com article titled &#8220;Top Ten Reasons Why the US Should Not Marry Mexico,&#8221; January 1, 2007.</p>
<p>3.) &#8220;My message to them is, not in two weeks, not in two months, not in two years, never! We must be clear that we will not surrender America and we will not turn the United States over to the invaders from south of the border.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p>Rep. Virgil Goode (R- Va.), at the March for America, Washington, DC, June 18, 2007.</p>
<p>4.) &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care if Mexicans pile up against that fence&hellip;. just run a couple of taco trucks up and down the line&hellip;.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p>Neal Boortz, anti-immigrant talk radio host on WSB-AM in Atlanta on June 18, 2007.</p>
<p>5.) &#8220;Terrorists are also walking in unopposed; our southwestern border is littered with Arabic papers and Islamic prayer rugs. &#8220;[5]</p>
<p>Jim Gilchrist, founder of Minutemen Project. From a press release announcing the forthcoming publication of a new book co-authored with Jerome R. Corsi, February 2006.</p>
<p>6.) &#8220;The brown toxic cloud strangling Los Angeles never lifts and grows thicker with every immigrant added. One can&rsquo;t help appreciate the streets of Paris will soon become the streets of LA. However, Paris&rsquo; streets erupted while LA&rsquo;s shall sink into a Third World quagmire much like Bombay or Calcutta, India. When you import that much crime, illiteracy, multiple languages and disease-Americans pick up stakes and move away.&#8221; [6]</p>
<p>Frosty Wooldridge, anti-immigrant author and activist. Summarizing an address by a KABC-AM talk radio host to the Federation for American Immigration Reform director&rsquo;s meeting, Fall 2005.</p>
<p>7.) &#8220;What we&rsquo;ll do is randomly pick one night every week where we will kill whoever crosses the border &hellip; step over there and you die. You get to decide whether it&rsquo;s your lucky night or not. I think that would be more fun.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p>Brian James, anti-immigrant talk radio host with KFYI-AM in Phoenix.  Suggesting a solution to the immigration problem in Arizona while filling in for the regular host, March 2006.</p>
<p>8.) &#8220;Shoot him.&#8221; [8]</p>
<p>Phil Valentine, anti-immigration talk radio host, WWTN in Nashville.  Advising Border Patrol agents to shoot undocumented immigrants during an anti-immigrant rally in Franklin, Tennessee, April 27, 2006.</p>
<p>9.) &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to make it in this country so (immigrants) can&rsquo;t exist here&hellip;. We&rsquo;ve got to rattle their teeth and put their feet to the fire!&#8221; [9]</p>
<p>Terry Anderson, anti-immigrant talk radio host with KRLA in Los Angeles.  Speaking at a &#8220;Hold Their Feet to the Fire&#8221; anti-immigrant rally organized by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, April 22, 2007.</p>
<p> 10.) &#8220;Our enemies are bloodied and beaten.  We cannot relent.  Our boot is on their throat and we must have the willingness to crush their &lsquo;throat&rsquo; so that we can put our enemy down for good. The sovereignty of our nation and the future of our culture and civilization is at stake.  The United States is a beacon of salvation unto the rest of the world.  Our freedoms, our culture is mans salvation.  If we perish, man perishes.&#8221;[10]</p>
<p>Joseph Turner, Save Our State (S.O.S), now a staff member with the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Message sent to Save Our State supporters on October 7, 2006.</p>
