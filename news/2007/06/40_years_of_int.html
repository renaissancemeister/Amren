<h1><a href="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070611/NEWS/706110327">40 Years Of Interracial Marriage</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dionne Walker, AP, June 11, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Reporters no longer beat a path to the modest white house just over the Caroline County border &mdash; and that&rsquo;s fine with its owner, a soft-spoken 67-year-old who never wanted the fame her marriage brought.</p>
<p>Born Mildred Jeter, she&rsquo;s known mostly by the name she took when she &mdash; a black woman living in segregated Virginia &mdash; dared break the rules by marrying a white man named Richard Loving.</p>
<p>The union landed the Lovings in jail, and then before the U.S. Supreme Court, and finally in the history books; 40 years ago Tuesday, the court ruled in favor of the couple, overturning laws prohibiting interracial unions and changing America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the rest of the Jim Crow South struggled to divide the races in the early &rsquo;50s, blacks and whites in tiny Central Point had long been intertwined. They worked together on farms, raising chickens and tobacco. They drag-raced together.</p>
<p>And often, they were intimate, explained Edward Clarke, who grew up in the town an hour outside Richmond, today little more than vast fields, ragtag homes and weed-choked farm houses.</p>
<p>Standing in the hilly cemetery where Richard Loving is buried, he swept his hand out over markers reading Jeter, Byrd and Fortune &mdash; black folks, he explained, many so pale they could pass for white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was in this setting that a skinny 11-year-old nicknamed &#8220;Bean&#8221; met a 17-year-old boy who was a family friend, according to Phyl Newbeck, a Vermont author who detailed the case in the 2004 book, &#8220;Virginia Hasn&rsquo;t Always Been for Lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over several years, friendship led to courtship &mdash; but their relationship took an abrupt turn when an 18-year-old Mildred became pregnant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And so, they drove some 80 miles to Washington, D.C., in 1958, married, and returned to Central Point to start a new life.</p>
<p>Within a month, they were in jail.</p>
<p>Now 84, Garnett Brooks vividly recalls bursting into the Lovings&rsquo; home at 2 a.m., rousing the couple out of their sleep and hauling them off to face the law. Word of their marriage &mdash; nobody&rsquo;s sure who complained &mdash; had reached the commonwealth&rsquo;s attorney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 28-year-old Phil Hirschkop was just a few months out of law school when he overheard a professor discussing the Lovings with another lawyer, Bernard Cohen.</p>
<p>It was 1964, and the Lovings had spent the past few years living in exile in Washington after being convicted on charges of &#8220;cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,&#8221; according to their indictments. Laws banning racially mixed marriages existed in at least 17 states.</p>
<p>The couple had avoided a year in jail by agreeing to a sentence mandating, &#8220;both accused leave Caroline County and the state of Virginia at once, and do not return together or at the same time to said county and state for a period of 25 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The frustrated young wife had written to then Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who referred her to the ACLU for help returning to Virginia permanently. Cohen filed a motion to vacate the 1959 sentence against the couple, but hit a dead end when the courts refused to respond.</p>
<p>American courts had proven tough on race-mixing in the past: A handful of cases similar to the Lovings&rsquo; had come up before in other places, but were stuck in a thicket of state-sanctioned racism and red tape.</p>
<p>But lawmakers had just passed the Civil Rights Act, and across the South, blacks were defying Jim Crow&rsquo;s hold.</p>
<p>Hirschkop was convinced the Supreme Court was ready for change, too &mdash; but the right case had to come before the justices, free of any legal loopholes the state could seize upon. The Lovings presented just such a case.</p>
<p>Hirschkop argued that laws must treat each citizen equally, and that &#8220;when a law is based on race, it is immediately suspect and the burden is shifted to the state to show there is a compelling interest to have that sort of racial differentiation.&#8221;</p>
<p>On June 12, 1967, the court agreed.</p>
<p>Richard, by all accounts a stoic, blue-collar man content to let Mildred do the talking, moved his family into a small house on Passing Road, and tried to live happily ever after.</p>
<p>That ended when a drunken driver struck their car in 1975, killing Richard and costing Mildred her right eye. The small cemetery where he is buried is a few minutes from their home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each June 12, Loving Day events around the country mark the advances of mixed-race couples. Mildred doesn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the grasroots celebrations, or to today&rsquo;s interracial pairings &mdash; &#8221;You see so many&#8221; &mdash; and she doesn&rsquo;t do anything special to mark the date of the Supreme Court ruling.</p>
