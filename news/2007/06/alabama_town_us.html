<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>When Harper Lee wrote &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird&#8221; she could not have known it would be hailed as a classic, much less that it would shape the way her hometown viewed its past.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s novel has put Monroeville, Alabama, on the map and acted as a magnet for tourists. It has also stimulated debate in the town about the legacy of racial segregation that prevailed in the south until the 1960s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Published in 1960, it was an instant sensation. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has sold at least 30 million copies and a film of it starring Gregory Peck is hailed as a classic.</p>
<p>But sales only tell part of the story. U.S. readers often cite it as their favorite novel. It ranked second only to the Bible in a reader survey of books that had affected them the most. Library Journal voted it the novel of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Every spring, thousands of Mockingbird tourists flock to Monroeville to visit locations associated with Lee&rsquo;s life, the book and the courthouse used in the film.</p>
<p>They also come to watch a stage adaptation of Mockingbird. Act One takes place in the grounds of the court but for Act Two the audience and players move indoors to the original oval-shaped courthouse where the book and film are set.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>FALSELY ACCUSED</b></p>
<p>Lee may have based her story on an actual rape trial that took place in Monroeville&rsquo;s old courtroom, according to Jane Ellen Clark of the Monroeville County Heritage Museum.</p>
<p>In 1934 Walter Lett, a black man, was tried for the rape of a white woman. He was sentenced to death but according to records recently uncovered, white citizens wrote anonymously to Alabama&rsquo;s governor to say he had been falsely accused.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>George Thomas Jones, a former businessman who writes local history, went to school with Lee and remembers her as a tomboy similar to the character of Scout, the novel&rsquo;s narrator.</p>
<p>Jones, 81, said he could understand why the all-white juries of the time would have returned a guilty verdict in such cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;People were called &lsquo;nigger lovers.&rsquo; Regardless of the circumstances they would have been branded and they would have been social and economic outcasts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jones said relations between blacks and whites were in some ways better at that time despite injustices against blacks, and the social climate had been misunderstood.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was mutual respect and we didn&rsquo;t have racial problems back in the &rsquo;20s and &rsquo;30s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People that were good at heart on both sides had no problem in getting along.&#8221;</p>
