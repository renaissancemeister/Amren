<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>While Pinal County officials in Florence were announcing arrests in a gruesome murder, Teresa Galinberti was laying flowers at the Queen Creek-area home of Amber LeAnn Hess. She said she was friends with both the teenage victim and the suspects.</p>
<p>Nicolas Castillo and Todd Hoke, both 16, were arrested in the killing of Hess, whose burned body was found Monday in the desert near Florence, Pinal County Sheriff&rsquo;s officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a tearful press conference Wednesday morning in Florence, parents Michael and Candy Hess thanked the community for helping deputies identify the suspects.</p>
<p>Candy Hess said Hoke was one of her daughter&rsquo;s best friends, who spent hours in their home playing video games and watching movies. He would call constantly, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was like a brother to her, which makes this even more confusing to us,&#8221; Candy Hess said.</p>
<p>Galinberti, who was placing flowers at the Hess home Wednesday morning, said Hoke and Castillo were &#8220;nice guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;d just hang out together,&#8221; said Galinberti, describing her friendship with the two boys and Hess.</p>
<p>She said they would go swimming or have water balloon fights.</p>
<p>Galinberti said she had talked with both Hoke and Castillo and they were crying, telling her they didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Candy Hess said her daughter had a falling out with Hoke, who had called the girl a disrespectful name. The mother emphasized the boy wasn&rsquo;t her daughter&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically they just didn&rsquo;t like her and for whatever reason were planning to kill her,&#8221; Pinal County Sheriff Chris Vasquez said. &#8220;They went to her home and through a combination of beating, stabbing and choking, killed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teens were booked in connection with first-degree murder charges, with other charges are likely, Vasquez said. The teens likely will be charged as adults.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The assault is believed to have happened late Friday or early Saturday. Detectives aren&rsquo;t sure if Hess let the two boys into her home or if they forced their way inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I&rsquo;m told this girl fought for her life in that home, and she didn&rsquo;t die easy. It was very brutal,&#8221; Vasquez said in an interview from Salt Lake City, where he is attending a law enforcement convention. &#8220;If they had been adults, I would be screaming for the death penalty in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Search warrants were served at the boys&rsquo; homes Tuesday, and &#8220;quite a bit&#8221; of evidence linking them to the crime was seized, Vasquez said. He said the crime was one of the most vicious he has seen in 30 years in law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;She just didn&rsquo;t die quick enough for them. So they just kept doing different things to her,&#8221; the sheriff said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s amazing in today&rsquo;s society how vicious 16-year-olds can get,&#8221; he said.</p>
