<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Eighteen-year-old Emily Jane Hilscher was one of the first two victims to be identified in the Virginia Tech massacre, along with 22-year-old Ryan Clark.</p>
<p>The pair were neighbours in rooms 4040 and 4042 on the fourth floor of the West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory where a gunman began the first of 33 campus shootings on Monday morning just after 7am, US time.</p>
<p>The gunman was identified by federal law enforcement authorities late last night as Cho Seung-Hui. He was described as being a 23-year-old South Korean male student who lived on campus, but no other details about him were released last night.</p>
<p>Witnesses to the shooting said that the gunman was involved in an argument with a girlfriend and had later stormed out of the dormitory building.</p>
<p>A counsellor &mdash; believed to be Mr Clark, who was also a resident adviser &mdash; was called to calm the situation at the dormitory.</p>
<p>The gunman returned at 7.15am and shot Ms Hilscher and Mr Clark. US media reported that Mr Clark had been shot in the neck.</p>
<p>More than two hours later the murderer &mdash; armed with two hand guns &mdash; stalked the corridors and classrooms of a college building in another separate part of the campus for about 20 minutes, killing 30 more people.</p>
<p>A further 20 students were injured, either by gunfire or jumping out of the massacre building.</p>
<p>The gunman was wearing a vest holding ammunition, witnesses said. He carried a 9mm semi-automatic and a .22-calibre handgun, both with the serial numbers obliterated, according to federal law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>He turned his weapons on himself before police could arrest him.</p>
<p>Police decided against closing down the college after the first shootings occurred, believing the killer had left the scene and was &#8220;off campus&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then, two hours later, gunshots erupted from a separate building about 1km from the scene of the first murders.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech student Chen Chia-hao told Taiwan cable TV about the first shootings.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had a big quarrel in the West Ambler Johnston Hall and he shot her. Then the RA (dormitory supervisor) came, and he shot the RA,&#8221; Mr Chen said.</p>
<p>Witnesses told how the gunman calmly roamed the classrooms inside Norris Hall, a building housing a science and engineering school, firing his weapon as students and teachers vainly tried to flee.</p>
<p>Wearing a black leather coat and maroon hat, the gunman used chains to lock the doors to the building from the inside before beginning his killing spree.</p>
<p>Friends of Ms Hilscher and Mr Clark last night posted messages on internet social-networking site &#8220;Facebook&#8221; and other blogs remembering her as a vibrant girl with an engaging personality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emily was a wonderful person who always put a smile on my face,&#8221; wrote friend Jessica Gould.</p>
<p>Mr Clark &mdash; a prefect in the dormitory &mdash; was in his fifth year at Virginia Tech and a leader in the school&rsquo;s marching band.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was such a friendly person,&#8221; said friend Sarah Davis, 21, a trombone player in the band.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came in as a freshman I was scared to death. He was always really friendly. If he didn&rsquo;t know you, he&rsquo;d introduce himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Columbia County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in Georgia confirmed 22-year-old Mr Clark from Georgia was one of the first shooting victims.</p>
<p>Ms Hilscher was confirmed dead by local law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear about people in other places mourning the loss of a child of great potential and great hope, and now we&rsquo;re the ones that have to bear that great loss,&#8221; an official said last night.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hilschers are strong people, and this is a strong community, and they&rsquo;ll have our support. The best we can hope for is a time of healing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The list of the dead is known to include at least four staff members.</p>
<p>A message on the school&rsquo;s engineering department website paid tribute to two of the staff.</p>
<p>It read: &#8220;In Memoriam. Professor Kevin Granata and Professor Liviu Librescu who died on April 16, 2007 while serving Virginia Tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Granata was killed while teaching his course in the Norris Hall building.</p>
<p>Professor Librescu, originally from Romania, was killed alongside Professor Granata.</p>
<p>A third instructor in the engineering department, Professor G.V. Loganathan, was also killed.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush addressed the nation in the hours after the shootings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools should be places of safety and sanctuary and learning. When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community,&#8221; he said.</p>
