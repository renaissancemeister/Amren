<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Fadela, Afef, Naima and Yasmine all grew up in North African families in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, and all want a policy of firmness on immigration and welfare reform from France&rsquo;s next president.</p>
<p>For centuries Marseille has acted as a melting pot, absorbing waves of immigration from Italy, Armenia, eastern Europe and France&rsquo;s former African colonies that made it the country&rsquo;s most ethnically-mixed city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marseille is a land of welcome. People here say they are &lsquo;Marseillais&rsquo; first, and French second,&#8221; said Myriam Salah-Eddine, the 35-year-old daughter of Moroccan immigrants and a deputy to the city&rsquo;s centre-right mayor.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a real sense of belonging,&#8221; forged in loyalty to the local football team and star player Zinedine Zidane and helped by a sunny climate and urban planning that managed to avoid immigrant ghettoes, she said.</p>
<p>But among established North Africans, estimated at around 150,000 people out of a population of 800,000, there are signs that attitudes towards immigration are toughening.</p>
<p>Fatima Arazi, a 51-year-old photographer who moved to France from Morocco 30 years ago, runs a tea room and women&rsquo;s association in an immigrant district of central Marseille.</p>
<p>Though she belongs to a network campaigning for an amnesty for illegal immigrants already settled in France, Fatima has come to back a radical line on immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;North Africans are sick of seeing their countrymen living in misery. There just isn&rsquo;t enough work here,&#8221; said Fatima, who runs co-development schemes in African villages &#8220;to persuade people not to come here in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The going rate for illegal immigrant workers in the neighbourhood is 15 euros a day for a woman, 20 for a man &mdash; how can you live on that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She says she cannot bear to see Muslim women in their 50s forced to work as prostitutes in the neighbourhood and advocates &#8220;one big amnesty and then we stop everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>For Yasmine Mendy, 21, a catering student who arrived in France from Morocco as a baby, &#8220;We need to stop immigration and sort out our own problems first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Algerian-born Fadela Garbi, also 21 and training to become a laboratory technician, agrees there should be &#8220;no more immigration at all&#8221;, admitting that she doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;want immigrants pinching my job&#8221;.</p>
<p>Only Samia &mdash; a 21-year-old biotechnology student whose parents arrived illegally from Tunisia &mdash; said she supported further immigration &#8220;if it can give people a chance, like I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others deny any affinity with the far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who calls for zero immigration, the deportation of all illegal immigrants and the scrapping of welfare protection for foreigners.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Le Pen wins, my suitcases are ready &mdash; I&rsquo;ll get straight out of here!&#8221; said Fatima with a rueful laugh.</p>
<p>But an ethnic minority vote for the FN exists in the Bouches-du-Rhone region around Marseille, where Le Pen clocked up one of his highest scores in the run-off against Jacques Chirac in 2002.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people from minorities do vote for the FN, though it&rsquo;s hard to put a figure on it,&#8221; said Salah-Eddine, who belongs to the UMP party of Nicolas Sarkozy, the right-wing presidential frontrunner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many black and Arab people have real trouble accepting a small fraction of their community that soils their image &mdash; like Islamic extremists &mdash; and they imagine that Le Pen targets only those people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked who they would back in Sunday&rsquo;s vote, the women in Fatima&rsquo;s tea room gave short shrift to the Socialist candidate Segolene Royal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Segolene&rsquo;s just trying to pull the wool over our eyes,&#8221; said Yasmine, while Fatima worried &#8220;no one knows how she plans to pay for all these promises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People think &lsquo;I&rsquo;m North African so I have to vote for the left&rsquo;,&#8221; said Naima Yahia-Berrouiguet, a 30-year-old secretary of Algerian parents. &#8220;But Segolene just wants to raise taxes &mdash; with the left we&rsquo;re going to sacrifice people on middle-incomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>All approved of Sarkozy&rsquo;s campaign pledge to make work pay more than welfare &mdash; and were unfazed by his description of young troublemakers in immigrant suburbs as &#8220;racaille&#8221; (rabble). &#8220;Guys here boast about being &lsquo;racailles&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not even an insult,&#8221; Fadela said.</p>
<p>Fatima said she &#8220;agrees with seven out of 10 things Sarkozy says&#8221;, complaining that &#8220;France&rsquo;s welfare system has created a culture of layabouts &mdash; once you add up all the different benefits, it&rsquo;s not even worth getting a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she and the others were also uncomfortable with his blunt style &mdash; Fadela reproaching him for always &#8220;taking the side of the police&#8221; and Naima warning &#8220;for young people, it would be like a Big Brother society if he&rsquo;s elected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afef, 43, a soft-spoken mother of five who arrived in France from Tunisia as a toddler and works as a school caretaker, said: &#8220;I agree with Sarkozy&rsquo;s ideas, on tax and jobs for young people &mdash; but he scares me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So four of the six women said they were preparing, without much conviction, to vote for the centrist Francois Bayrou because, in Samia&rsquo;s words, &#8220;There&rsquo;s no other choice. Sarkozy has lots of good ideas &mdash; but his methods just aren&rsquo;t right&#8221;.<br>
