<h1>Forrest 1 Step Closer To Gone</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Patton, Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville), April 10, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Climaxing the latest chapter in an argument that has lasted for more than a quarter-century, the School Advisory Council at Nathan Bedford Forrest High School voted Monday night to recommend changing the school&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The 8-6 vote to change the name is nonbinding. The issue will now go before the Duval County School Board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Monday night&rsquo;s meeting, which was attended by about 35 people, many wearing name tags identifying themselves as supporters of the current school name, no comments from the public were allowed.</p>
<p>One member of the SAC, James Colwell, a Forrest parent, made a passionate appeal to change the name, arguing that the school&rsquo;s namesake is too closely associated with the Ku Klux Klan, which some accounts credit him with founding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the association you want the school to have?&rdquo; Colwell asked.</p>
<p>Forrest, who rose through the ranks to become a Confederate general, has long been a controversial figure. Besides having been involved with the KKK, Forrest was a slave trader before the war and has been accused of allowing his men to massacre black Union soldiers during the 1864 capture of Fort Pillow. As with Forrest&rsquo;s role in the KKK, his responsibility for what happened at Fort Pillow has been the subject of debate.</p>
<p>Forrest&rsquo;s name was originally chosen for the Westside high school in 1959, at a time when many Southern school boards were digging in their heels against the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1954 decision ordering school desegregation.</p>
<p>Although there was no reported debate in choosing the name Forrest over Valhalla, the original choice, controversy over the name has flared several times over the last quarter-century. It became an issue again last fall when Steven Stoll, an adjunct social science professor at Jacksonville University, began campaigning for a name change.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Forrest name, such as businessman Bodie Catlin, who came to the meeting toting a huge notebook devoted to the issue, argue that Forrest was a great military tactician, a man of his times, and, near the end of his life, he reconciled with black Americans.</p>
<p>Todd Thompson came to the meeting carrying a proposal to place a plaque at the school entrance quoting from an 1875 speech in which Forrest told a largely black audience: &ldquo;We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color but not in sentiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thompson argued that changing the name &ldquo;will only offend a different group of people.&rdquo;</p>
