<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>As part of its well-meaning quest to rid itself of racism, the Seattle School District has found a program it considers racially biased.</p>
<p>Summer break. The 10-week hiatus from school is institutionally racist, said the district&rsquo;s Equity and Race Relations director. That means it&rsquo;s something that &#8220;results in less access to services and opportunities of a society based on race.&#8221;</p>
<p>The premise is that summer break disrupts the school year, thereby deterring students of color from catching up academically.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t struggling white students benefit from more time in school, too? Can&rsquo;t students who need to catch up go to summer school now?</p>
<p>If we want to extend the school year, then let&rsquo;s talk about that. What&rsquo;s skin color got to do with it? More importantly, how will declaring that summer break is racist actually lead to any better education for kids?</p>
<p>This obsessive focus on race in Seattle schools has gone too far. It&rsquo;s killing us.</p>
<p>You may have seen a story in this newspaper last week titled, &#8220;Race, class splinter a school.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was about how white people started enrolling their kids in a black school, but then left in a case of white flight.</p>
<p>I am one of those white people. After four years of fundraising and volunteering at our local school, Madrona K-8, we transferred our kid to a school a mile away, McGilvra Elementary.</p>
<p>We did it because there were 31 kids crammed into our first-grade class. They got little to no recess. And the administration seemed to be resistant to the arts, music and foreign-language study. And was ambivalent, sometimes hostile, to our efforts.</p>
<p>We were sad to leave. There are many great things at that school, such as dedicated teachers and outstanding families.</p>
<p>But the degree to which race has come to dominate the story is eye-opening. Especially since much of the race-baiting comes from school-district employees.</p>
<p>First, there was an e-mail, sent from the vice principal&rsquo;s computer to a departing white parent. It said the school wanted to get rid of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you enjoy your wonderful educational experience aboard the Mayflower,&#8221; it read.</p>
<p>At a community meeting last week to talk about the issues facing the school, it seemed everything was about race.</p>
<p>A former Madrona principal, now a principal at another Seattle school, said white people in and around the school make her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A Madrona school official talked of his suspicion of &#8220;white charity.&#8221; He dismissed the concerns of parents who had left as &#8220;BS&#8221; and said he wouldn&rsquo;t attend another meeting about it.</p>
<p>And a Seattle high-school teacher and coach declared that the real problem with white people is they don&rsquo;t want to go to school with blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question race matters. We don&rsquo;t live in a colorblind society. But this school district is so focused on race it&rsquo;s fueling an atmosphere of division. It&rsquo;s blinding the district to what matters even more than race &mdash; its job to educate any kid who walks in the door.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
