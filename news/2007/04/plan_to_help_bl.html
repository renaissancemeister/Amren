						<p>Schools, parents and pupils must do more to improve the attainment of black Caribbean boys, a union has said.</p>
<p>A charter on the issue published by the National Union of Teachers stresses the responsibilities they all have.</p>
<p>It says the boys themselves must develop their own learning and parents must support them and their schools.</p>
<p>Schools must encourage them to have high expectations and have &ldquo;a moral commitment&rdquo; to raise and promote their achievements, the NUT added.</p>
<p>The charter, published at the union&rsquo;s annual conference, in Harrogate, was compiled with the collaboration of groups of black boys in London, Birmingham and Manchester.</p>
<p>Expectations</p>
<p>One of them, 16-year-old Dillon Max-Grant, who is taking his AS-levels, said he got involved because he knew people who were not achieving as well as they should be.</p>
<p>He said the often quoted issue of family breakdown and absentee fathers in black communities was &ldquo;not really the issue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to them to try to succeed,&rdquo; he said, but added that parental expectations were important.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because of their social circumstances, their expectations did not match the abilities of the students and the capabilities of the schools that taught them.</p>
<p>A co-author of the charter, education expert Gus John, said: &ldquo;If there is a theme that runs through the report, the theme is let us all live up to our responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That applied to everyone &mdash; but youngsters themselves had to be responsible for their own learning along with &ldquo;their mums and dads and their schools&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s nothing short of a national scandal that, 60 years after the Empire Windrush brought some 300 people from the Caribbean to these shores, young black boys, Afro-Caribbean boys, are still underachieving at the rate at which they are,&rdquo; Mr John said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mayhem&rsquo;</p>
<p>That culture contributed to &ldquo;the sort of mayhem in our communities that we have seen in the past weeks&rdquo; &mdash; with black boys being stabbed to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some parts of the country the life expectancy of young Afro-Caribbean males is 25,&rdquo; he said &mdash; such as in his home city of Manchester.</p>
<p>There was a culture of low expectations on the part of the boys themselves and those who taught them, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the parents themselves who have children in schools now have been schooled in a culture of low expectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need to organise themselves to demand much more of the school system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NUT general secretary Steve Sinnott said: &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t get the changes that are required unless everybody does their part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That includes the youngsters. They can&rsquo;t turn round and point the finger and blame everybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unwitting racism&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kay Hampton, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said the NUT should not focus solely on underachievement among black boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue of underachievement is not restricted to African-Caribbean boys as such but to a wide range of people, including for example Gypsy traveller communities and other minority communities for example females within certain communities as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the idea is a good one, but we would urge that the bigger picture of underachievement in education is taken into consideration as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently the Department for Education and Skills published a report which said black pupils were routinely punished more harshly, praised less and told off more often in English schools than other pupils.</p>
<p>It said staff in many schools were &ldquo;unwittingly&rdquo; racist.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the department said: &ldquo;Black pupils demonstrated nationally the greatest progress in GCSE results of any ethnic group, improving more than twice as fast as the average, with promising results for 11 and 14-year-olds boding well for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we fully recognise that there&rsquo;s more to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we are working even harder to remove the barriers to their learning, engage with these children and give them an extra push they need &mdash; particularly in deprived areas where many ethnic minority children live.&rdquo;<br>
