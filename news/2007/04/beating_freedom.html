<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>On Thursday, April 12, a gang of Somali thugs on a downtown Oslo street attacked Kadra, a Somali woman who now lives in Norway, and beat her senseless, breaking several of her ribs. They were enraged at her for her recent statement that the Qur&rsquo;an&rsquo;s views of women needed reevaluation. They also might have been angry because of her role in revealing the widespread support among imams in Norway for female genital mutilation; Kadra exposed their support for this horrific procedure using a hidden camera in a 2000 documentary for Norwegian television.</p>
<p>As they beat her, Kadra&rsquo;s attackers shouted Allahu akbar &mdash; Allah is great &mdash; and recited verses from the Qur&rsquo;an. &#8220;I was terrified,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While I lay on the pavement they kicked me and screamed that I had trampled on the Koran.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following Tuesday, two men in Mississauga, Ontario, attacked journalist Jawaad Faizi, who writes for the Pakistan Post, a newspaper based in Mississauga. The attackers told Faizi to stop &#8220;writing against Islam,&#8221; and particularly to stop criticizing an Islamic organization, Idara Minhaj-ul-Quran, and its leader, a Muslim cleric named Allama Tahir-Ul-Qadri.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;writing against Islam,&#8221; or being perceived as having done so, has always been dangerous, as Salman Rushdie and many others can attest. The New York Times reported in 2002 that a professor at the University of Nablus in the West Bank, Suliman Bashear, who &#8220;argued that Islam developed as a religion gradually rather than emerging fully formed from the mouth of the Prophet,&#8221; was for this novel and, from the point of view of traditional Islam, heretical teaching, thrown out of a second-story window by his students. In 1947, the Iranian lawyer Ahmad Kasravi was murdered in court by Islamic radicals; Kasravi was there to defend himself against charges that he had attacked Islam. Four years later, members of the same radical Muslim group, Fadayan-e Islam, assassinated Iranian Prime Minister Haji-Ali Razmara after a group of Muslim clerics issued a fatwa calling for his death. In 1992, the Egyptian writer Faraj Foda was murdered by Muslims enraged at his &#8220;apostasy&#8221; from Islam &mdash; another offense for which traditional Islamic law prescribes the death penalty. Foda&rsquo;s countryman, the Nobel Prizewinning novelist Naguib Mahfouz, was stabbed in 1994 after accusations of blasphemy. Under Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy laws, many non-Muslims have been arrested, tortured, and sentenced to die on the slimmest of evidence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attacks on Kadra and Faizi show that there are many others in the West today who believe that they must likewise act upon Allah&rsquo;s commands and victimize those whom they deem to have offended Islam.</p>
<p>This is a challenge to all Western governments, for it is a challenge to the freedom of speech that is rooted in the constitutions and laws of Western states, and ultimately is intimately connected with the freedom of conscience and the Judeo-Christian view of the dignity of the human being before God. Western leaders should move now to make it abundantly clear that attacks on &#8220;blasphemers&#8221; and &#8220;heretics&#8221; will not be tolerated; that those who believe that Sharia should be the highest law of the land are not welcome here; and that the West will defend our Judeo-Christian culture and heritage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, only one thing is certain: there will be many, many more such attacks.</p>
