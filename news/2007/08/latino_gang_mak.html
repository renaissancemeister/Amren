<p>[Nickson] Gilles, an African-American from Florida, was shot in the neck, shoulder and left eye Sept. 3 after the Pierce Brahmas&rsquo; first game of the season. It was just one of many attacks against blacks that landed Canoga Park Alabama on L.A.&rsquo;s list of most dangerous gangs.</p>
<p>The Latino gang hasn&rsquo;t hidden the fact that it targets African-Americans in this community, which just two years ago earned the prestigious All-AmericaCity designation, largely due to its racial diversity.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s gang list and another that branded Gilles&rsquo; accused assailant, Fernando Araujo, one of the city&rsquo;s most wanted gangsters offer little solace to Gilles, who has undergone three eye surgeries and hasn&rsquo;t played football since he was shot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since July 2006 there have been 12 shootings targeting Canoga Park blacks. Following two recent attacks, police have stepped up warnings to African-Americans to be wary of Canoga Park Alabama.</p>
<p>Some blacks in the community, as well as educators working with African-American students, said they have felt the wrath of the gang&rsquo;s racist campaign of violence firsthand. But other blacks paint a more idyllic picture of Canoga Park, one that helped it become the first Los Angeles community to win the All-America honor in the award&rsquo;s 58-year history.</p>
<p>Once a predominately white community, today Canoga Park is about 50 percent Latino, 28 percent white, 15 percent Asian and 4 percent black, according to a 2005 American Community Survey listed in a California State University, Northridge, report.</p>
<p>Although police can&rsquo;t pinpoint why &#8220;CPA&#8221; has focused on blacks, one possibility is street culture emulating prison life, where black and Latino inmates have repeatedly clashed as they align themselves along racial lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the last two attacks on blacks in and around Lanark Park separated by mere days and feet, police want African-Americans to be on alert for any trouble.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most recent shooting occurred about 10:40 p.m. on June 13 when a 23-year-old African-American man drove into the parking lot of Lanark Park.</p>
<p>His attackers, believed to be several Latino males who remain at large, walked up to the car, asked where he was from &mdash; a common gang challenge &mdash; shouted racial slurs and shot him in the chest and shoulder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite recent criticism of the city&rsquo;s anti-gang efforts in the Valley, which has seen about a 15 percent increase in gang crime so far this year, Smart said a gang injunction and suppression efforts have been effective &mdash; until recently.</p>
<p>After CPA, with about 400 active members, was put on the city&rsquo;s most-dangerous gangs list, the additional manpower from the department&rsquo;s violent crime task force and other agencies led to dozens of arrests and helped bring the gang&rsquo;s attacks under control for a while, Smart said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did go five months without any reported shootings because of all the suppression and energy we&rsquo;ve poured into there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We created what we thought was a safe community, and now it has reared its ugly head again.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Clashes near campus</b></p>
<p>Karen Cano is principal of the Coutin School, a small alternative education center in Canoga Park serving elementary through high school students with behavior or academic problems.</p>
<p>She said CPA has increasingly become a problem as mostly young, teenage members challenge her black students and others through the school&rsquo;s fence. Now, she doesn&rsquo;t let her black students walk outside campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re in a constant battle,&#8221; Cano said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve had &nbsp;fights&hellip; .</nobr> They come up to the fence, flash their gang signs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cano said the CPA members said to the black students in the group: &#8220;&lsquo;You n &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; better watch yourselves,&#8221;&rsquo; Cano said.</p>
<p>Following the brawl, Cano received a phone call from the father of an injured CPA member.</p>
<p>He repeated the gang&rsquo;s warning: &#8220;&lsquo;You better watch your n &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;,&#8221;&rsquo; Cano &mdash; a white woman who grew up in Canoga Park &mdash; said the man told her. &#8220;It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I just don&rsquo;t know who thinks that way anymore. I guess they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cano said the situation is exacerbated by the fact that many of her students come from troubled backgrounds themselves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She has tried to reason with the CPA members, even suggesting they attend her school, to no avail. She&rsquo;s hoping more attention recently promised by LAPD gang unit officers materializes into a police presence that she and her staff say has been grossly inadequate.</p>
<p>With some staff members describing the current environment as &#8220;a war zone,&#8221; Cano said there is a sense of urgency to resolve the tension.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Pain and grief</b></p>
<p>Brown-on-black violence in Canoga Park is an obvious concern, but it is rarer than intra-race shootings. Lela Jones knows this firsthand.</p>
<p>Her son, Torrey, 23, an African-American, was shot to death outside her Canoga Park apartment complex in 2003 by a young black man who police say was probably a gang member.</p>
<p>His death is a reminder that the majority of L.A&rsquo;s gang-related homicides are black-on-black and brown-on-brown assaults.</p>
