<h1>More Black Women Marrying Men Of Other Races, Census Reveals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 5, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black women around the country also are reconsidering deep-seated reservations toward interracial relationships, reservations rooted in America&rsquo;s history of slavery and segregation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking cues from their favorite stars &mdash; from actress Shar Jackson to tennis pro Venus Williams &mdash; as well as support blogs, how-to books and interracially themed novels telling them it&rsquo;s OK to &#8220;date out.&#8221;</p>
<p>It comes as statistics suggest American black women are among the least likely to marry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She reflects many black women frustrated as the field of marriageable black men narrows: They&rsquo;re nearly seven times more likely to be incarcerated than white men and more than twice as likely to be unemployed.</p>
<p>Census data showed 117,000 black wife-white husband couples in 2006, up from 95,000 in 2000.</p>
<p>There were just 26,000 such couples in 1960, before a Supreme Court ruling banished laws against mixed marriages.</p>
<p>Black female-white male romance has become a hot topic in black-geared magazines and on Web sites, even hitting the big screen in movies like last year&rsquo;s &#8220;Something New.&#8221;</p>
<p>That film centers on an affluent black woman who falls for her white landscaper, a situation not unlikely as black women scale the corporate ladder, said Evia Moore, whose interracial marriage blog draws 1,000 visitors a day.</p>
<p>It features articles like &#8220;Could Mr. Right Be White?&#8221; and pictures of couples like white chef Wolfgang Puck and his new Ethiopian wife.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She pointed to low rates of black men in college, a place where women of all races often meet their spouses.</p>
<p>Black women on campus largely are surrounded by non-black men: In 2004, 26.5 percent of black males ages 18 to 24 were enrolled in college versus 36.5 percent of black women that age, according to the American Council on Education&rsquo;s most recent statistics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of black women are realizing or feeling that the pickings are slim,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re made even slimmer, grumble many black women, by high rates of successful black men choosing blondes. For some, they argue, white wives are the ultimate status symbol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly three quarters of the 403,000 black-white couples in 2006 involved black husbands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, psychological barriers have discouraged black women from crossing racial lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black women are socialized to stick by their men,&#8221; explained Kellina Craig-Henderson, a Howard University psychology professor who studied 15 black women dating interracially.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But black men are voicing their own frustrations with women they feel regard them with suspicion. &#8220;They treat us all the same,&#8221; said W. Randy Short, a Washington writer who dates across races. &#8220;The rapist on the TV is the same as me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a frustration director Tim Alexander tackles in &#8220;Diary of a Tired Black Man,&#8221; a frank film covering everything from black women&rsquo;s demeanors to their weight. Frustrated by black women, the main character dates a white one.</p>
<p>&#8220;To a certain degree, black people are sick of each other,&#8221; Alexander said. &#8220;It would be better for black men and black women to open their options.&#8221;</p>
