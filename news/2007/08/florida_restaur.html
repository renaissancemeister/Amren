						<p>More people get sick after eating in Florida restaurants than in any other state, according to a new report issued by a Web site that monitors data on government health inspections.</p>
<p>Healthinspections.com said the leading causes of food poisoning were seafood, ethnic food and all-you-can eat buffets.</p>
<p>Florida, with 29,729 restaurants, had 77 separate outbreaks of food-borne illness affecting 300 people during 2005, the most recent year for which statistics are available.</p>
<p>California, with 58,426 restaurants, ranked second with 62 outbreaks, and Ohio was third with 38, followed by Michigan with 35 and New York with 31.</p>
<p>The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association did not respond to an e-mail request for comment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rich Carlish of Hollywood said the industry nationwide has problems. When he eats out locally, Carlish said, he often sees workers at fast-food restaurants failing to wash their hands, one of the main causes of food-borne diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regulators should take this seriously, but they won&rsquo;t,&#8221; said Carlish, author of Restaurants: It&rsquo;s a Dirty Business, who spent 20 years managing restaurants in North Carolina and New Jersey. &#8220;You got a lot of unqualified people managing restaurants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Washing hands a must</b></p>
<p>Chirag H. Bhatt, Healthinspections.com&rsquo;s food-safety director, said managers need to focus more on food safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&rsquo;t think hard enough about how a simple task such as washing hands can make a difference,&#8221; said Bhatt, a registered sanitarian and a former chief of Houston&rsquo;s Health Department. &#8220;Its all about attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nationwide, fish and seafood, including oysters and shrimp, were tied with ethnic buffets, serving items such as spring rolls and tacos, as the most common cause of food-borne illness, followed by lettuce-based salads.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is terrible,&#8221; said Marilyn Shiffer, a retired businesswoman living in Fort Lauderdale. &#8220;I got sick two months ago after eating seafood at a restaurant. I called them to complain, and they offered me a free meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Florida&rsquo;s restaurants may have even more problems than those in other parts of the state.</p>
<p>Hammond of the state&rsquo;s Health Department said the area&rsquo;s dense population, large tourist industry and increasing number of restaurants could all be a cause for South Florida&rsquo;s increase in cases.</p>

					<p>To the Mexican poster:   California is <span class="caps">SECOND </span>on that list and is full of <span class="caps">ILLEGAL</span> Mexicans working in all kinds of food preparations! I have had &#8220;Montezumas&#8221; revenge whenever I have gone to fast food joints or restaurants that hire these people! They are not known for their sanitation practices&hellip;.</p>

					<p>At buffet restaurants it&rsquo;s not only the employees you must worry about, but other customers as well. Everybody in the place is handling the same utensil. I learned to take a bottle of hand sanitizer with me, and I use it right before I touch my fork.</p>

					<p>Mexican American may be right, but whenever I watch Spanish <span class="caps">T.V.,</span> I see mexican flags raised in crowds at outside musical events as well as hearing some in the crowd shouting &#8220;Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!&#8221;  There are more Mexicans there than one might expect&hellip;</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely certain the propensity of restaurant owners to hire cheap immigrant (Hispanic) labor has nothing do do with it. I mean we all are aware that you mention &#8220;sanitation&#8221; to a Hispanic, they figure you&rsquo;re talking about trash trucks, right?</p>

					<p>As far as seafood goes it spoils very quickly. I have some friends who work in the restaurant industry and they tell me many places don&rsquo;t throw out their seafood. They just spray a little water on it to keep it &#8216;fresh&rsquo; and serve it the next day. You want to be especially wary when the restaurant has been closed the day before and it is a buffet. I would also strongly reccomend personal bottles of hand sanitizers. </p>
