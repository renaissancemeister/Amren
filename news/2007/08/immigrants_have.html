						<p>Four in ten homes built over the past ten years have been needed because of immigration, figures have revealed. </p>
<p>Nearly 600,000 properties have had to be constructed because of the new arrivals since Labour came to power in 1997, said researchers at the House of Commons Library. </p>
<p>This is three times more than the number of homes needed for immigrants under the last Conservative government. </p>
<p>The library, a team of independent researchers who carry out work for MPs, said an average of 19,000 immigrant households a year were established between 1992 and 1997. </p>
<p>But the figure has since soared to 66,000 a year, which has helped to price many British first-time buyers out of the market. </p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2005, the latest period for which figures are available, 592,000 houses were needed solely for immigrants. </p>
<p>With Eastern Europeans continuing to pour in over the past two years, this total is certain to have climbed even higher. </p>
<p>The research raises huge questions about Gordon Brown&rsquo;s housebuilding programme. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister is planning to build three million homes by 2020, after accepting it is hard for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder. </p>
<p>He said providing more affordable housing is &ldquo;vital&rdquo; for the country&rsquo;s future and is to raise the annual target for new homes from 200,000 to 240,000 by 2016. </p>
<p>But, based on current levels of immigration, 1.2million &mdash; or 40 per cent &mdash; of the new homes will be needed to house immigrants. </p>
<p>The Government has claimed only a third of demand for new houses &mdash; 33 per cent &mdash; comes from immigrants. </p>
<p>Tory MP James Clappison, who requested the figures, said by reducing the number of immigrants, the Government could build fewer houses and limit the damage to the countryside. </p>
<p>Mr Clappison, a member of Westminster&rsquo;s home affairs committee, added: &ldquo;These figures are a direct result of the polices adopted by the current Government since 1997. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of new migrant households is more than three times the rate of the last years of the Conservative government, and a huge proportion of demand for housing is now the result of migration. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Gordon Brown is having to build more and more houses because of the people his Government is allowing in, and it shows a complete lack of grasp of what is going on.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &ldquo;There are legitimate concerns about managing some of the effects of migration on communities. We are listening to these concerns. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why we have taken a more gradual approach to opening our labour market to people from Bulgaria and Romania by maintaining restrictions and introducing quotas on low-skilled jobs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>2 in 10 immigrants on &lsquo;skilled&rsquo; migrant worker scheme on minimum wage </p>
<p>Immigrants given special visas to fill &ldquo;highly skilled&rdquo; jobs are working here as taxi drivers and food packers. </p>
<p>Two in ten of the 50,000 &ldquo;elite&rdquo; new arrivals are earning below the average wage, Immigration Minister Liam Byrne admitted. </p>
<p>Critics said it is proof the programme has been abused. </p>
<p>From 2002 the scheme offered foreigners the chance to settle in the UK permanently after they had lived here for four years. </p>
<p>To be accepted, migrants had to show qualifications which would allow them to work in jobs such as medicine or engineering. </p>
<p>But there was no requirement for them to have secured a job here first, and many instead entered low-skilled professions. </p>
<p>Last year, Mr Byrne tightened up the requirements to join the scheme and said those who had exploited it could be deported. </p>
<p>But a report by peers and MPs said the changes breach the migrants&rsquo; human rights and should be scrapped. <br>
