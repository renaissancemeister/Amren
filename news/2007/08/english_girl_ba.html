<h1>English Girl Barred From Government Job &hellip; Because She Is Wrong Kind Of White</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Nicol, London Daily Mail, August 6, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teenage science student has been banned from applying for a training programme with the Environment Agency because she is white and English.</p>
<p>The recruitment agency handling the scheme told Abigail Howarth, 18, that there was no point in her submitting an application because of her ethnic background.</p>
<p>But bizarrely she could have applied if she had been white and Welsh, Scottish or Irish.</p>
<p>Abigail, who wanted to join the Agency&rsquo;s flood management programme, saw an advert in a local newspaper offering positions in the Anglia region where she lives, complete with a £13,000-a-year tax-free grant.</p>
<p>It made no mention of the ban on white English applicants, merely noting that candidates from ethnic minorities, such as &#8220;Asian, Indian&rsquo; and &#8220;White Other, e.g. Irish, Welsh, Scottish&rsquo;, were encouraged to put themselves forward.</p>
<p>Abigail, of Little Straughton, Bedfordshire, said: &#8220;I was really disappointed. To be told being &#8220;White English&#8221; ruled me out in my home county shocked me. I know why there are positive action training schemes to assist those who are genuinely discriminated against but when it&rsquo;s broken down to this level it seems crazy to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really wanted to work for the agency and I was very excited &mdash; followed by feeling very disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not have minded had I been beaten for the position by somebody better able than me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abigail, who is awaiting the results of A-Levels in environmental science, geography and geology, emailed PATH National Ltd, the company handling applications.</p>
<p>She asked: &#8220;Am I correct in assuming that as I am English (White) I need not apply as the preference is for the minorities you have listed, or can I apply anyway?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Three days later, PATH recruitment officer, Bola Odusi, replied: &#8220;Thank you for your enquiry unfortunately the traineeship opportunity in [sic] targeted towards the ethnic minority group to address their under representations in the professions under the Race Relations Act amended 2000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a policy may breach Race Relations legislation as employers must prove ethnic groups are under-represented before using positive discrimination strategies.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency admitted it had &lsquo;no evidence that white Welsh, Scottish or Irish workers were under-represented&rsquo; in the Anglia region.</p>
<p>South West Bedfordshire Tory MP Andrew Selous said: &#8220;I think this is complete nonsense and the Environment Agency should be taking the best people, irrespective of their background.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is obviously borne out of some idiotic quota system. Abigail should have been able to apply and been judged on her own merits. I will raise this when I have a meeting with the Environment Agency next month.&#8221;</p>
<p>PATH National&rsquo;s organisational development manager, Mary McDowell, said: &#8220;The &#8220;White Welsh&#8221;, &#8220;White Irish&#8221; and &#8220;White Scottish&#8221; is a technicality in law &mdash; if they are a minority, they are entitled to places on these schemes &mdash; they are not part of the majority group, which is &#8220;White English&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8220;White English&#8221; in this area are the majority group and hence could not apply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way the law is laid. This is a chance for people who might be less employable to gain experience, just experience. Public-sector organisations have a duty to ensure they reflect the make-up of the society they serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Environment Agency says 387 of its 12,000 workers claim BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) status. A spokesman added: &#8220;The Commission for Racial Equality has confirmed we are acting legally.&#8221;</p>
<p>A CRE spokeswoman said: &#8220;The Commission will be checking with the Environment Agency to clarify the current situation regarding their positive action initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Positive action can only be used to encourage or train particular under-represented groups.&#8221;</p>
