<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It probably seemed like a good idea at the time. Stuck for inspiration about what to wear at their village carnival, one group made a last-minute decision to dress up in mock Muslim burkas.</p>
<p>Calling themselves the &#8220;Page Three Beauties from the Ramalama Ding-Dong Times&#8221;, the 17 men and women carried placards with made-up names such as &#8220;Miss Hairyarmpitsbad&#8221;, &#8220;Miss Slackistan&#8221;, &#8220;Miss Notbadinbedabad&#8221; and &#8220;Miss Reallyamanistan&#8221;.</p>
<p>This group caused outrage when they paraded through the streets of Cornwall dressed in Burkas. They also used fake compasses to face Mecca when &lsquo;praying&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As they walked the one-mile parade route, the group knelt down in mock prayer and used fake compasses to try to find Mecca.</p>
<p>Their routine impressed carnival judges &mdash; a mayor, two district councillors and a parish councillor &mdash; and they were shortlisted for the &#8220;best entry&#8221; prize.</p>
<p>But before any awards were handed out, police told the group to leave after complaints about racism.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as one member of the team apologised, the organisers of the annual carnival through the winding streets of St Columb Major, near Newquay, Cornwall, insisted their inclusion was not offensive.</p>
<p>Nina Brenton said: &#8220;We were approached by about six students from out of the area and they thought it was disgusting and offensive to Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;They asked how we could allow it in our carnival, but it&rsquo;s not up to us to dictate what&rsquo;s offensive. We did advise the group in question what had happened and gave them the choice of whether to carry on in the procession, and they did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody was having fun, but in the end the police got involved and moved them on. It was a fun day and no one was offended.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pat Harvey, mayor of the borough of Restormel and one of the judges, said: &#8220;I felt that the community enjoyed their act. The group was excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she added: &#8220;We were made aware their act could have been taken as offensive in certain parts of the community and therefore, given my responsibility, I felt the cup should be given to another group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local religious representatives criticised the carnival entry. Fareed Ahmad, president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association for Devon and Cornwall, said: &#8220;With carnivals it&rsquo;s quite difficult to judge between humour and causing offence, and on this occasion it looks like they have that balance wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Reverend Chris McQuillen-Wright, of St Columb Minor parish church, added: &#8220;One can see the intended humour and the play on words but, in light of the current international climate, it was insensitive and in bad taste.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot believe they thought people were going to laugh. No one would want to curtail freedom of speech, but it&rsquo;s hard to differentiate this from downright bullying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night one member of the group, Dave Holloway, of St Columb Major, apologised but said they had intended to make fun of themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of the carnival is to dress up and have fun,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We were not laughing at anybody, more at ourselves than anything else, and we certainly didn&rsquo;t want to cause any offence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d like to say on behalf of everyone in the group how sorry we are if some individuals found it in bad taste. We were never set out to upset anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite officers moving the group on, Devon and Cornwall police said no action will be taken because no official complaint was made.</p>
<p>The carnival was held 20 miles from Padstow, where the annual Darkie Day &mdash; which involved locals blacking up their faces &mdash; regularly attracted accusations of racism. It is now known as Mummers Day.</p>
