						<p>Parents are sending children to school in stab-proof uniforms to guard against knife crime, it has emerged.</p>
<p>They are paying a firm which makes body armour to line blazers and jumpers with a stab-resistant material called Kevlar.</p>
<p>The precautions are aimed at protecting pupils from knife attacks as street crime spills over into schools.</p>
<p>A wave of stabbings involving teenagers includes the killing of promising footballer Kiyan Prince, who was knifed just yards from his school gates in north London.</p>
<p>Kevlar is a synthetic fibre that can be spun into fabric five times stronger than steel and is used in armoured vests worn by British troops in Iraq.</p>
<p>Essex-based firm BladeRunner produces clothing lined with the material for police and security guards.</p>
<p>But inquiries from parents have now prompted it to modfify school uniforms.</p>
<p>Barry Samms, one of the firm&rsquo;s directors, said the company initially produced stab-proof hooded tops that were bought by teenagers.</p>
<p>It was then asked by parents about the possibility of strengthening school uniforms with Kevlar.</p>
<p>The firm now offers to line blazers and jumpers with the material if pupils send in their uniforms.</p>
<p>Blazers cost £120 to stab-proof and jumpers £60 to £70.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blazers and jumpers have come on the back of the hooded tops which we launched in April,&#8221; said Mr Samms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since then we had a small amount of parents contacting us and asking if we could do something similar with their kids&rsquo; uniforms so we have been modifying them for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have done blazers and jumpers &mdash; we have done about half a dozen so far. It&rsquo;s something that we can do and it&rsquo;s something we are offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said parents who had inquired about stab-proof clothing were genuinely fearful for their children&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;From what I can gather and from speaking to parents it&rsquo;s just peace of mind for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke to a lady yesterday whose son was mugged on a bus coming home from school. She has also got two daughters, but she always sends them to school with no money on them and no jewellery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police chiefs said the precautions were an &#8220;extraordinary step&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality of course is that crimes involving knives are proportionately very very low&#8221; Alf Hitchcock, of the Association of Chief Police Officers told BBC News Online.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we do recognise some parents have that fear and some feel they need to go these steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seven boys under the age of 16 have died in knife attacks in the space of just two months this year.</p>
<p>Teachers are also demanding to be equipped with stab-proof vests to protect them from attack as they frisk pupils for knives and guns.</p>
<p>New laws which recently came into effect will allow staff to conduct forcible searches of students suspected of carrying offensive weapons.</p>
<p>But members of the Professional Association of Teachers are saying they should not be made to carry out searches unless they are provided with body armour.</p>
