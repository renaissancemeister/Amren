<h1><a href="https://buchanan.org/blog/?p=826">PJB: The Color of Crime</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick J. Buchanan, buchanan.org, August 21, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The arrest of Jose Carranza in that Newark massacre, amid reports he had Hispanic accomplices and the murders may have been part of a gang initiation, has also elevated the issue of the black-brown war raging in U.S. big cities.</p>
<p>In the Aug. 10 Washington Post story that covered the Carranza arrest, the same page had two related articles. One was headlined, &#8220;Study: Almost Half of Murder Victims Black,&#8221; the other, &#8220;Slaying of Popular Editor Stuns Blacks in Oakland.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second headline reveals an ideological slant. One would assume that everyone in Oakland was stunned by the daylight execution of African-American editor Chauncey Bailey, allegedly by a teenage foot soldier at Your Black Muslim Bakery, which Bailey was investigating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly half the people murdered in the United States are black,&#8221; declared the opening paragraph, &#8220;part of a persistent pattern in which African-Americans are disproportionately victimized by violent crime, according to a new Justice Department study.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among other conclusions reported by the Post:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Blacks are more likely than whites or Hispanics to be victims of crime.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Blacks are more likely than any other group to be victims of &#8220;serious violent crime,&#8221; such as rape, assault and robbery.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be confronted with a firearm during a crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Black victimization is a real problem, and it&rsquo;s often black on black,&#8221; said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Toledo who studies crime statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often&#8221;? Correction, Harris. As the Post reports and Justice concedes, in more than nine out of 10 cases, black victims are murdered by fellow blacks.</p>
<p>Utterly absent from the Post story and Justice Department stats is anything about white victims of crime. Not a word. Do white folks not count, though they are two-thirds of the population?</p>
<p>Yet, in &#8220;The Color of Crime: Race, Crime and Justice in America,&#8221; produced by the &#8220;right-leaning&#8221; New Century Foundation in 2005, using the same FBI and Justice surveys, startling facts emerge:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&#8220;Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against other blacks.&#8221; Forty-five percent of the victims of violent crime by blacks are white folks, 43 percent are black, 10 percent are Hispanic.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Blacks are seven times as likely as people of other races to commit murder, eight times more likely to commit robbery and three times more likely to use a gun in a crime.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&#8220;Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit violent crime against a white person than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.&#8221; (If decent black folks have trouble hailing a cab, and they do, these numbers may help explain it.)</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Black-on-white rape is 115 times more common than the reverse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What do these statistics tell us? A message the Post will not report. The real repository of racism in America &mdash; manifest in violent interracial assault, rape and murder &mdash; is to be found not in the white community, but the African-American community. In almost all interracial attacks, whites are the victims, not the victimizers.</p>
<p>Why does the Post not report such statistics? My guess: Because the stats would shatter the Post&rsquo;s cultivated image of America as a land where white racism is the great lurking malevolent monster. Stories that conform to the image get play. Stories that contradict it are buried.</p>
