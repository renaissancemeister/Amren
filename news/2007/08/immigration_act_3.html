<h1>Immigration Activist Arrested Outside L.A. Church</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, August 20, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal immigrant who stayed in a Chicago church for a year to avoid separation from her 8-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, was arrested Sunday and being processed for deportation. </p>
<p>Elvira Arellano, who arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday after leaving her sanctuary to campaign for immigration reform, was arrested around 1:30 p.m. outside Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church where she had been speaking to reporters, said the Rev. Walter Coleman, pastor of Adalberto United Methodist, the Chicago church. </p>
<p>Arellano was &#8220;being processed for removal to Mexico based upon a deportation order originally issued by a federal immigration judge in 1997,&#8221; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a news release. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anti-illegal immigrant groups said the arrest was long overdue. </p>
<p>&#8220;Just because the woman has gone public and made an issue of the fact that she is defying law doesn&rsquo;t mean the government doesn&rsquo;t have to do its job,&#8221; said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors limits on immigration. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arellano came to Washington state illegally in 1997. She was deported to Mexico shortly after, but returned and moved to Illinois in 2000, taking a job cleaning planes at O&rsquo;Hare International Airport. </p>
<p>She was arrested in 2002 at O&rsquo;Hare and convicted of working under a false Social Security number. She was to surrender to authorities last August. </p>
<p>She sought refuge at the storefront church on Chicago&rsquo;s West Side Aug. 15, 2006. She had not left the church property until deciding to be driven to Los Angeles, Coleman said. </p>
