<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Virtually every newcomer to Multnomah County since 2000 has been Latino, radically changing the growth pattern of the state&rsquo;s urban core, new U.S. Census figures show.</p>
<p>While the slow-growing county remains largely white, 94 percent of new growth in the past seven years has been Hispanic. That means that 18,600 of Multnomah County&rsquo;s 19,800 new residents were Latino.</p>
<p>Data also show that a trend of losses in the white population since 2000 appeared to begin reversing itself in 2006. That could be from a boost in jobs and the migration of young professionals, but experts say it is too soon to tell whether that shift spells a long-term change in course.</p>
<p>In Washington County, the Latino community continues to see just as much growth as it has in recent years, with the non-Latino white population gaining just as much ground. And in Marion County, Latinos now make up 21 percent of the area&rsquo;s total population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the Hispanic population still makes up 10 percent of Multnomah County&rsquo;s 661,584 residents, the new presence of Latinos has been felt, said Nathan Teske, family services program manager for El Programa Hispano, a leading Latino outreach organization with offices in Portland and Gresham.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the program&rsquo;s funding and staff have doubled to about $2 million and more than 30 employees. Today, the agency serves an estimated 12,500 Latinos across the county.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen the growth, and we&rsquo;ve experienced it,&#8221; said Teske, adding that El Programa&rsquo;s crisis hot line and tax preparation program face the most demand from Latino clients. &#8220;As a culture-specific provider, we still have programs turning some people away because some are stretched to the max.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others aren&rsquo;t as content with being part of the county.</p>
<p>Jovina Rosario moved to Gresham&rsquo;s Rockwood neighborhood six months ago from Beaverton. The single mother of two is out of work, and her neighborhood is heavy with crime and gangs.</p>
<p>On the west side, she worked odd jobs at Pizza Hut and Subway, but she no longer could afford to pay rent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As seen for years, the growth of Latinos continues to overshadow that of other groups because of high birth rates, said George Hough, director of Portland State University&rsquo;s Population Research Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s Latinos ages 0 to 17 where we really see change,&#8221; Hough said. &#8220;That dramatic change is what will say what our futures are going to look like.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Moving west</b></p>
<p>Across the Portland area, the growth of many counties is being shaped by Latinos. To the west, the bulk of Hispanics continues to gravitate toward Washington County.</p>
<p>There, Latino growth has remained steady at about 36 percent or 24,000 new residents since 2000. Non-Latino whites are growing at a similar pace. Asians also have diversified the area, adding 12,700 residents since 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among those most affected by the Latino boom is Marion County with a population of 374,230. One out of every five residents in the area is Latino.</p>
<p>In Woodburn&rsquo;s downtown, along four blocks that surround the city&rsquo;s center, a public square with a fountain known as &#8220;La Plaza&#8221; sets the stage for some of the most visible changes in Marion County.</p>
<p>Latino-owned businesses that have revitalized a once-vacant downtown anchor every corner, their colorful hand-painted facades speaking to the dramatic transformation of this city of 23,000 in the past two decades as the city&rsquo;s Hispanic population has ballooned to more than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Now included in the minority pool of non-Latino whites is Tammy Alloway. Over the years, those around her have looked less and less like her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no white people here,&#8221; says the 48-year-old as she exits one of downtown Woodburn&rsquo;s four Mexican bakeries with a bag of baked goods. &#8220;Not a single one.&#8221;</p>
