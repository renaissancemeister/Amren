						<p>Jackson County Prosecutor Jim Kanatzar announced Saturday that Ollie F. Thompson, 17, has been charged with first degree statutory rape.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the victim, a 3-year-old female, reported the incident to her foster parent. The child was given an examination and was discovered to have contracted two sexually transmitted diseases from the incident.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have requested Thompson be held on $250,000 cash bond.</p>

															Baby on Life Support After Rape, Police Say 
						</div>
										<p>
						<i> 
								Jill King Greenwood, Pittsburgh Tribune Review, November 17, 2007
							</i></font>
						</p>
										<p>
						<p>A 10-month-old Troy Hill girl was on life support Friday after police said her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend beat and sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>Clinton Smith, 30, was arraigned on charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, rape and endangering a child, according to an arrest affidavit.</p>
<p>He is being held in the Allegheny County Jail without bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>The baby was taken to Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Oakland with severe bruising to her face, arms and legs. Police said she was bitten on the chest.</p>
<p>"The doctors are telling us it doesn&rsquo;t look good," city police Lt. Daniel Herrmann said. "If the baby survives, she may be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life."</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Janet Squires, chief of the Child Advocacy Center at Children&rsquo;s Hospital, said most child abusers don&rsquo;t "wake up in the morning and decide they&rsquo;ll hit a child."</p>
<p>"They react to stress and get angry with a crying child or they just lose it," she said. "And sometimes two lives are ruined as a result."</p>
<p>Smith was awaiting trial on an unrelated June charge of simple assault, court records show. In a separate September 2006 case, a woman was granted a protection-from-abuse order against Smith after she said he came to her home and attacked her.</p>
<p>Brandy Lamison, 21, who wrote in a court document that she had a 2-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son with Smith, said he smacked her so hard she almost fell off a balcony. When the couple&rsquo;s daughter tried to run to her mother, Smith knocked the child to the ground, Lamison wrote in the PFA application.</p>
<p>"He grabbed me and strangled me, leaving bruises on my neck," she wrote. "I fear for the safety for myself and kids."</p>

					<p>Suprise, suprise. Just reading the headlines, I knew it was either blacks or mexicans. What depraved beasts these people are. This also happens in Africa daily, if you ever read the news from Africa. These people need to be shipped out of this country and let them have their own island somewhere! Just looking at their pictures gives me the creeps. Talk about Black women and their boyfriends! They will &#8220;date&#8221; just about anything, and allow their kids to be sexual playthings to these animals. They ought to put these women in prison also. Wonder how much more of this stuff is going on in the black community that we don&rsquo;t hear about? Also the Mexican community.</p>

<p>Once again, the statement is incomplete.  It should finish &#8220;Or they simply react as we have seen thousands of other times.&#8221;  The baby was probably doing something awful like crying for food, or because of teething.  Bad baby.</p>

					<p>Gee folks, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t mention either of these child- molesting animals&rsquo; names and the word &#8220;noose&#8221; in the same sentence.  There are places in this country where you could get charged with a felony.</p>

					<p>The first case is surely wrongly charged.  That&rsquo;s not statutory rape, that&rsquo;s probably child molest first or seconed degree, or rape of a child in the first or second degree.  Statutory rape usually implies having consensual sex with someone who&rsquo;s underage by two or three years.   </p>

					<p>There will be no chance to avoid greater rates of crime in the future unless blacks who commit the largest percentage of violent crime are incarcerated for at least 15 years on the first offense and 25 to life on the second offense.  1st degree misdemeanors should be punished with a minimum of five years.  No Parole.</p>
<p>Shifting the black population into prisons is the only sane way to keeping society free from these violent repeat offenders who are responsible for the majority of crime in the <span class="caps">US.</span></p>
<p>Once criminal adult blacks are in jail, we need to build juvenile detention centers for their criminal kids, so we can get them off the streets and incarcerated before they get a chance to maim or kill innocent people.</p>
<p>Remember!  No society is safe that has criminal blacks on the streets.  Diversity guarantees violent crime.</p>
<p>Prison is the only answer.</p>

					<p>Sex crimes against young Black females is incredibly high.  As is <span class="caps">CONSENSUAL </span>sex between older men and under-18 females.  But what&rsquo;s even more disturbingly high is the lack of response against it.  I wonder if the parent and foster parent who reported these crimes were White.  </p>

<p>Exactly! Nancy Grace was ready to lynch the innocent Duke lacrosse players but apparently a grown man raping a 10 month old baby is no big deal, not even newsworthy. Thank God for the Internet or I would never hear about any of these crimes.</p>

<p>Yeah, the guy who raped and beat a 10-month old baby to death had his life ruined too.  He&rsquo;s the real victim here.</p>
<p>What a crock.  His life was obviously ruined a long time ago.  He ruined it.  I hope he&rsquo;s sentenced to dance the &#8220;Newgate Hornpipe&#8221;, as they used to call it.</p>

You are so right. If this guy had been white (or Asian too, I suspect) white females across the country would be ready to launch into a tirade about evil blue-eyed honky male devils. It wouldn&rsquo;t even matter to them if he was guilty or innocent-just so long as he is an accused white male. Let the monster be black or chicano and white females won&rsquo;t say one word. <br><br>
Also, I wonder how he is going to play the race card in this situation since his victim is black? Perhaps he will say that living in a world dominated by evil white males drove him mad, or that child rape is a black thing that whitey just doesn&rsquo;t understand. (Which will no doubt elicit applause from the <span class="caps">NAACP, </span>chicanos, Marxists and white women who will appreciate his brave efforts to defend his culture.)<br><br>

					<p>This happens so often in South Africa that we now make jokes about it. This story pales in comparison to kind of things black African men do here to babies. No other race, including dark-skinned races, in South Africa does this.</p>

					<p>Where are the Reverends Jackson and Sharp? Obviously these spurious allegations are nothing more than a slanderous calumny leveled against this poor black by the &#8220;man&#8221;. </p>
<p>This is simply an effort to smear a whole group of people based on the false allegations leveled against one individual. We all  know that blacks are intelligent, civilized, well behaved, and an asset to society.</p>
<p>We need to allow more of these folks to migrate here from Africa, Haiti and all the other third world hellholes we can find. OH! I forgot, president shrub is already doing that by allowing our borders to remain wide open.</p>
<p>What we need to do now is pass legislation to prevent anyone from using the word &#8220;noose&#8221;. </p>

Oh, no. They are violent <span class="caps">BECAUSE </span>they have been in prison, you see. I happened to catch an ad for an &#8220;investigative report&#8221; on the subject.

					<p>&ldquo;BOTH men should have been held without bond. Nooses aren&rsquo;t necessary. We know what happens to child molesters in prison.&rdquo;<br>
Posted by at 9:27 PM on November 20 </p>
<p>Sadly, this is no longer true. Today blacks are all in prison simply because whitey hates them according to their mentality. Back before the praise of diversity when white morality still rubbed off on the black community these sorts of crimes were more rare and other blacks could still see the dire effects of predators like this. Now they are locked in a brotherhood of hate whitey anytime he interferes in their private lives.  These people now totally ignore massive amounts of black on black crime and protest the extremely rare white on black crime or simply protest any rule of law they are subjected to. One mention of the huge amount of black on white crime sometimes motivates them to mention black on black crime only to slap the face of white victims of black crime. Diversity has actually given black morally cover and allowed the true content of their character to flourish.  <br>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t lump all white females into the same catergory. I am outraged everyday of life over the fact that we &#8220;white people&#8221; are being discriminated against everyday. White males have been taking a beating for far too many years and it is high time for them to stand up and be counted! Our race is dying and I don&rsquo;t know if we can save it? </p>

<p>True enough. But you forgot to include Mexicans   &mdash;   who&rsquo;s pedophilia and incest have [dis]graced our Houston news far too often the last decade. You might add to your comment this addenum:</p>

<p>Yet our genious &#8220;elites&#8221; are steadily importing hundreds of thousands of more like these from the dark continent each and every year. May they be heartily remembered and well rewarded for their own and their African &#8220;friends&#8221; contributions to civilized society. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, white females such as yourself and Stephanie are few and far between.  It would be a blessing if more would stand by their men against this avalanche of PC reigning down on the heads of white males.  It just doesn&rsquo;t happen.  Especially from the younger white women that have grown up in this PC era.  In their minds, there is no higher calling or noble cause than to participate in the destruction of white men.  You are correct when you say, &#8220;White males have been taking a beating for far too many years and it is high time for them to stand up and be counted!&#8221;  I&rsquo;ll tell you, the day that white women once again publicly stand up and support their men, without shame, will be the day that we overcome this white racial assault.  It&rsquo;s tough enough for white males in this age of political correctness, without having to be challenged by your own women as well. </p>

					<p>Here in Atlanta they just had a case where three boys, 8 and 9, took an 11 year old female playmate into the woods and raped her.  Of course they do not release the race of the individuals but they are almost certainly black. One of the boys fathers has said &#8220;the sex was consentual, the girl changed her story&#8221; as if it was no big deal. A few years ago in the same area some 20 black males ranging from 13 to 29 gang raped a mentally retarded 12 year old girl.</p>

<p>Cop:  Point well taken.  I&rsquo;ll never understand how many woman can be married to White men, have White sons, and still support Affirmative Action and liberal politics.  How do they reconcile that in their minds?  By being moral relativists with no grounded principles can be the only rational explaination.  Even back in my 20&rsquo;s taking classes at the U of <span class="caps">TX,</span> I flirted with liberalism (manifested in years of animal rights and protection activism), but never embraced Affirmative Action.  Even then, I understood it to be a total betrayal to my White husband (and eventual) White son.</p>
<p>I do find it heartening and so encouraging to see more and more White women aboard AmRen.  Thanks for the compliment too.  Our White men&rsquo;s plight IS our plight <span class="caps">TOO. </span> Any White woman who doesn&rsquo;t <span class="caps">UNDERSTAND THAT </span>is a <span class="caps">FOOL.</span></p>

<p>I disagree. White women in general aren&rsquo;t going around trying to destroy white men. PC has afflicted both men and women pretty much the same. You forget that this immigration crisis is the result of the mostly male congress who care more about votes and their business interests than the country. There are also far more racially aware white women than you realize.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course they do not release the race of the individuals but they are almost certainly black.</p>
<p>Which you can pretty much take as a given, any time you hear of a particularly horrible rape case   &mdash;   usually involving torture, murder or rape of a very young girl. Which fact also tends to explain the reluctance of the media to release the race of the criminal rapists. (Fear of White backlash and wrath.)</p>
<p>What in the name of hell is it with our liberal lunatic fringe   &mdash;   that they cannot understand the near automatic propensity of Blacks to gravitate to crime, rape, mindless violence at the drop of a hint? To those of you pooh-poohing my comment, let me refer you to the endless horror stories in our daily news about the African homeland. Genocide, mass starvation, butchery, yes, even <span class="caps">CANNIBALISM </span>  &mdash;   has been in the news. Less than a month ago, I posted a link to a story about pygmy tribes complaining to the <span class="caps">U.N. </span>that rebel troops were kililng them   &mdash;   <span class="caps">AND EATING THEIR CORPSES</span>! But then again, the perps are <span class="caps">AFRICANS</span>! What more can be said?</p>
<p>I do have to concede, however, many rapes, even cases of incest and sexual abuse of children (including <span class="caps">FAMILY MEMBERS</span>) are done by Mexicans. Yes, here in Houston that type of news is far from uncommon. The weekend before last Christmas, a Mexican grandfather was arrested for raping his two young granddaughters. With the Mexican population, however, it&rsquo;s that &#8220;macho hombre&#8221; mentality, coupled with the mindset a woman simply does not have the right to refuse the man&rsquo;s unwanted advances.</p>
<p>To any White lady living alone, regardless of her reasons   &mdash;   I can only urge her to keep a <span class="caps">LOADED HANDGUN </span>safely hidden but raadily accessible in her home or apartment. There&rsquo;s nothing like a .38 bullet or two   &mdash;   in the abdomen   &mdash;   to give the would-be rapist&rsquo;s mind something far mor painful (to him) to think about.</p>

					<p>If the perp was white, or if a white man did this to a 3yr old white girl it would be all over the <span class="caps">MSM. </span> The pejoratives &#8220;white trash&#8221; and &#8220;redneck&#8221; would be used like they were going out of style.  It would be yet another case that most whites are just inbred, deviant, hicks and all the more reason why white women should seek the noble non-white male for marriage.   </p>
<p>I, like others, will be waiting with baited breath to see what the defense will be.  I&rsquo;m sure it will revolve around being a victim of white racism that made him commit such a disgusting act.   Either way Africa has truly arrived on American soil.        </p>
