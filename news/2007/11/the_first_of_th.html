<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>With enthusiasm that belied their numbers, the first 100 men committed to encouraging thousands of African Americans to become community activists took to the street yesterday in a &#8220;field training&#8221; exercise.</p>
<p>On a sunny, brisk day, the initial public patrols of &#8220;10,000 Men: A Call to Action&#8221; set out from the Vare Recreation Center at 26th and Morris Streets to canvass about 16 blocks of South Philadelphia and Point Breeze.</p>
<p>Trained to be polite and nonconfrontational, the men walked the neighborhoods and distributed printed door-hangers introducing the outfit, which was organized in reaction to a violent crime wave that has affected black neighborhoods more than most.</p>
<p>&#8220;There won&rsquo;t be conflict,&#8221; said Anthony Murphy, one of the leaders of the organization&rsquo;s field operations. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to be friendly black men. It&rsquo;s important.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organizers said they were not disappointed at the turnout; about 200 men who were trained as &#8220;vanguard&#8221; leaders had been expected to show up for the initial outreach. The men who patrolled yesterday are expected to supervise squads of about 10 men in the coming months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 10,000-men organization was introduced to the public last month amid substantial fanfare &mdash; and some skepticism that the effort would be short-lived and fizzle. Using volunteer labor and private contributions, organizers are methodically building the group as quickly as possible, they say, to prevent a loss of fervor among the more than 11,000 people who have registered with the organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Sylvester M. Johnson, who said he was committed to helping the organization after his retirement in January, said the group was determined to live up to the mostly positive attention it had received.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Encouraged to wear black, the men yesterday were fitted with armbands and baseball caps that sported the organization&rsquo;s red-black-and-green logo, an African shield with crossed spears.</p>
<p>The logo is intended to be nonpolitical and nonreligious, said Abdur-Rahim Islam, the organization&rsquo;s general manager. &#8220;The common denominator for us all is that we&rsquo;re all from Africa,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The organizers say their aim is to encourage African American men to take a more active role in their neighborhoods and families.</p>
<p>The unarmed field patrols will function as a kind of hybrid town-watch organization that will patrol neighborhoods and encourage young men &mdash; who commit much of the violent crime, and are its victims &mdash; to put down their arms and pursue a more productive path. The volunteers will attempt to steer the men toward services such as job-training programs.</p>

					<p>These &#8220;vanguards&#8221; will be minimally trained and with little or no background checks, I&rsquo;d wager. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see what becomes of this program. Does anyone else sense a disaster in the making?</p>

<p>100?  When compared to the 10,000 they wanted, then this effort has all the mathematical acuity of the &#8220;million man marches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Really?  I bid them read this, and see if they still want to be so &#8220;friendly.&#8221;</p>

					<p>This is a good attempt by the Black community to help itself, and I hope they can do it. After all, the racial conciouseness of Blacks is their most salient quality; a good model for most whites nowadays who can use a lesson or two about racial awareness. Good for the Blacks, we are rooting for this to work out for them.</p>

					<p>So I start reading this&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be conflict,&rdquo; said Anthony Murphy, one of the leaders of the organization&rsquo;s field operations. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be friendly black men. It&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;and I think, <span class="caps">OK, </span>so far so good. Maybe we should give this thing a chance. At least they&rsquo;re putting aside the malt liquor, getting off dey phat boo-tays, and trying to do something positive for a change, right? And then I get to this part&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Encouraged to wear black, the men yesterday were fitted with armbands and baseball caps that sported the organization&rsquo;s red-black-and-green logo, an African shield with crossed spears [&hellip;] said Abdur-Rahim Islam, the organization&rsquo;s general manager. &ldquo;The common denominator for us all is that we&rsquo;re all from Africa,&rdquo; he said.&#8221; </p>
<p>&hellip;and I say to myself, &#8220;Uh-oh!&#8221; </p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d rather they stayed sitting on their boo-tays with their malt liquor. Still socially dangerous, yet   &mdash;   but not as dangerous as blacks marching around in black uniforms with African-spear armbands, under the command of an Afrocentrist named Islam. There is no way <span class="caps">THAT </span>could be good for white folks   &mdash;   even if it did make some small dent in the crime rate over in Da Get-Toe.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Encouraged to wear black, the men yesterday were fitted with armbands and baseball caps that sported the organization&rsquo;s red-black-and-green logo, an African shield with crossed spears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am yet again amazed, at the black inability to realize their own collective foolishness. The logo on the cap could serve as emblem for this sad state of confused &ldquo;ingenuity,&rdquo; in toto. Indeed, were I to design a logo for a &ldquo;nonconfrontational&rdquo; organization&rsquo;s uniforms, I would consider a great many things, but crossed spears would not be one of them. </p>
<p>This whole idea is laughably pathetic, but that communal &ldquo;blazon&rdquo; of Afrocentric unity likely portends how it will all end. This would be with one or more of these &ldquo;friendly black men,&rdquo; either committing an act of violence, or being the victims of some of the same. I can almost read the headlines now:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tragedy, 10&rsquo;000 Men member participates in (or is killed while)&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fill in the blank anyway you like, just use your imagination!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>Hahaha. I don&rsquo;t know what I find more amusing: the fact that the blacks had to be <span class="caps">TRAINED </span>to be polite and nonconfrontational or the fact the this ebony blockwatch brigade has about a snowball&rsquo;s chance in Hell of going more than a month (probably a week) without one of the blacks punching someone out. </p>

Instead I think it&rsquo;s just a cover to radicalize the &#8220;inner city&#8221; thugs into one unit to fight the &#8220;real&#8221; problem- - you know &#8220;the man!&#8221; It will be something along the line of- - &#8220;why are brothas killin brothas when we need to be killin &#8220;the man&#8221; for puttin us in this situation!&#8221;</p>

					<p>I have done my best to read this story without laughing but cannot. It&rsquo;s a second incarnation of Marcus Garvey and his African Legion, by way of Amos and Andy and Jesse and Al. (Won&rsquo;t Al look splendid in his jaunty armband and baseball cap.)</p>
<p>But the matter also alarms me. Can anyone, and I mean anyone, imagine the shrill screams and low moans that would follow an effort to put ten thousand lightly armed white guys on the streets in an effort to lower the incidence of violent crime?</p>
<p>It may well turn out to be the first American echo of the black police states in Africa - if police be the right word. No matter what you call them they will be ten thousand vigilantes on the streets, their ranks packed full of the thugs and felons they are allegedly trying to stop, and on their minds a single conviction - that Whitey owes them.</p>
<p>This bunch puts us a step closer to street fighting and the last hope of compromise. Will no politician, scholar, civil libertarian or journalist speak out against this terrible idea?</p>

					<p><i>&#8220;The logo is intended to be <b>nonpolitical and nonreligious,</b> said Abdur-Rahim Islam, the organization&rsquo;s general manager.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>But I seriously doubt your motivations are &#8220;nonpolitical and nonreligious,&#8221; Abdur-Rahim? I&rsquo;ve never seen a photo of this guy, but I&rsquo;m quite sure that his wardrobe includes bad suits, red bowties, and those fancy &#8220;intellectual spectacles&#8221; that every <span class="caps">NOI </span>terrorist owns.</p>
<p>This is basically a rogue group of black mercenaries allowed to terrorize and intimidate the city where our fledging nation was born and nurtured.</p>
<p>And the local government not only allowed it, but encouraged it. I realize that the demographic elements of that part of town caused it, but leaving them to their own devices in matters like this may have a chain effect.</p>
<p>The next step is kicking the &#8220;racist&#8221; police force out of the &#8216;hood completely for self-rule. A template for autonomous black seperatist communities everywhere (yet no doubt our tax dollars will still flow in to help the &#8216;disadvantaged&rsquo;). </p>
<p>If this takes off, prepare to see more of it, maybe in a town near you.</p>

<p>10,000 black nationalists patrolling the streets? I feel safer already. I wonder how long until this citizens brigade morphs into a street gang and starts trying to control the local drug trade? - My guess is about 2 weeks.</p>

					<p>Encouraged to wear black?  Studies show that sports teams that wear black are penalised the most.  Psychologically they couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a worse &#8216;colour&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;d have thought white would have been the least confrontational, perhaps with a hint of apricot.  There&rsquo;s no mention of hats. I think something stripey with a bell on top would be nice.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;d like to know about the two ends of the money trail.  The article claims that &#8220;private contributions&#8221; are being used.  This, however, is how Jesse Jackson has always operated.  In other words who will be leaned on for money?  The words &#8216;extortion&rsquo; and &#8216;shakedown&rsquo; come to mind. </p>
<p>At the opposite end of the transaction, who will pocket this dough if the work is being done by &#8220;volunteers&#8221;.  Will these volunteers be paid?  If not, who will be pick up the cash for providing &#8216;training&rsquo;? </p>
<p>As one of my fellow posters alluded, this article would be hilarious if it weren&rsquo;t for the ever-present stench of corruption that surrounds every African enterprise. </p>
<p>I guess we shouldn&rsquo;t look for Philly to be removed from the ranks of the most dangerous cities list.</p>

					<p>What&rsquo;s fascinating is that once a perspective is developed, every single new fact fits the framework. The ideology becomes impossible to disprove, as everything only serves to confirm existing beliefs. The psychological term for this effect is called the &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221; and study of it may help you to understand the psychosis of some racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is basically a rogue group of black mercenaries allowed to terrorize and intimidate the city where our fledging nation was born and nurtured.</p>

<p>Polite and unarmed black men attempting to stop crime and instead encourage economic development are hardly &#8220;black mercenaries&#8221; (besides which, they&rsquo;re unpaid volunteers) and only am abject coward would be &#8220;terrorized&#8221; by the mere presence of a black man.

<p>If you don&rsquo;t think blacks are capable of being civilized, why not just state plainly that you advocate genocide? You won&rsquo;t win many converts with such a statement, but at least then your views will be honest and free of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Polite and unarmed black men attempting to stop crime and instead encourage economic development are hardly &ldquo;black mercenaries&rdquo; (besides which, they&rsquo;re unpaid volunteers) and only am abject coward would be &ldquo;terrorized&rdquo; by the mere presence of a black man. If it is corrupt and inefficient and doomed to failure, the only sensible reaction can be regret that blacks have not bettered themselves.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often afraid of black men because I&rsquo;ve been mugged a few times by black men, and didn&rsquo;t care for it. The guy who held the gun to my temple and pulled back the hammer made me shy away from diversity whenever possible. Next time I&rsquo;ll look around for a guy with crossed spears on his hat. </p>
<p>The reason these guys are a threat to the public safety is that they will morph into the uniformed street fighters that put facist and nazi governments in power in the 20th century, and could easily do so in this century, should H. Rodham-Clinton or B. Hussein Obama be elected to high public office, or if they are able to sue their way into office when the public rejects them.</p>
<p>And just because these guys don&rsquo;t draw pay does not mean they won&rsquo;t find ways to use their new status as hired muscle men to enrich themselves. At the very least, there is the $ that will be paid to equip and dress them, much of which will go the way of the Jena Defense Fund.</p>
<p>You say that anyone who doubts the ability of blacks to sustain such an undertaking must also advocate genocide. That accusation provides a perfect example of why this enterprise will fail. It is a burst of hysteria and insult meant to conceal the fact that your argument can not be supported by logic or example of past success. Things haven&rsquo;t worked out for peace seekers in Darfur, Congo, Zimbawe, Rhuwanda or South Africa, and genocide in those places wasn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t perpetrated by anyone white. </p>
<p>The only sensible reaction to the squalor, tension and turmoil this bunch will generate is a dread of all the ways in which innocent and uninvolved people will be blamed for the mess the vigilantes make.</p>
<p>Finally, this: Do you think such a plan as this could stem the tide of murder in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Sorry if my comments induced hysterics, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re looking at the entire article nor the implications this might hold if it succeeds. </p>
<p>And no, I am not threatened by the mere presence of a &#8220;friendly&#8221; black man, and at the surface, I agree this idea seems sound, sort of like the Guardian Angels.  If you pay attention to the details however, you can clearly see that the organizers of this movement were an incompetent police force and militant black nationalists. The uniforms and &#8220;Afrikan&#8221; armbands are clearly signs of a politically charged, black seperatist motivation, and being led by someone named &#8220;Islam&#8221; shows that the <span class="caps">NOI </span>or some other black power party is heavily involved. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read history and this is how they played politics in the streets of post-WWI Europe: uniformed, organized civilians marching in the streets, performing &#8220;civic duties&#8221; for the masses while spreading their politics. Back then they called them Red Brigades and Brownshirts.</p>
<p>If you think that these are grown boy scouts, or Mrs. Miller from the neighborhood watch looking out the window for trouble, you need to look again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read some of the other remarks and they made me rethink my position. If they only got 100 so far, it is probably another &#8220;Million Man March&#8221; scenario, and is doomed to fail. The culture that would lead them to pursue such a cause does not bode well for creating morally conscious citizens.</p>
<p>I really wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with it if it didn&rsquo;t stink of a recruiting program for groups like the New Black Panthers. The ultimate goal of those types of groups is not eliminating black crime - eliminating whitey is.</p>
<p>As for your comments being deleted, I post just like you and sometimes my comments don&rsquo;t end up on the board either. Just go with the flow.</p>

<p>This just proves that blacks are about separatism not integration. This also proves that minorities have a basic resistance to assimilation. Blacks want integration when they want to siphon our power, but then they steal the power they return to their black nationalist agenda. I guess no white people are allowed to join?

The problem for blacks is that they don&rsquo;t fit in White cultures which is why they feels the need to do things differently. Doing things differently (the non-white way) also dooms them to failure.</p>
<p>Blacks look at our justice system and see the large number of blacks who are caught in the system. The reason they&rsquo;re there, as I noted, is because blacks don&rsquo;t fit in White societies. No matter how much they try to act White or conform to White standards, they can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re not White. They will never fit into a majority White society any more than Whites will fit into a majority black society.</p>
<p>What blacks then do is say, &#8216;we need our own community standards; standards that our based on our beliefs and our systems&rsquo;. They then attempt to do things the black way but the black way is the wrong way. It&rsquo;s doomed to fail.</p>
<p>The White systems works because it works for Whites. The White system doesn&rsquo;t work for blacks because it can&rsquo;t. Further exacerbating the problem is that the black alternative of social, judicial, and criminal justice can&rsquo;t work either. Blacks refuse to believe that blacks are criminals. They firmly believe that society made them criminals and that society is to blame and society must be made to change.</p>
<p>The problem for blacks is not that there are too many blacks in the criminal justice system but that there aren&rsquo;t enough. Blacks need to remove the criminal element from their communities quickly, swiftly, and permanently. But they can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re obsessed by a nebulous ideal of &#8216;social justice&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s the black community that suffers for having black criminals in their communities.  </p>

<p>And we all know where black Americans convert to Islam: state prison.</p>
<p>Also, why are they encuraging gangbangers to become activists?  Why not do something useful?  They could wait at bus stops at night and walk women home.  They could hang out in big parking lots and escort people to their cars. Or patrol areas around schools in the afternoon to prevent the thugs from killing each other. So why are they going door to door?</p>
<p>But recruiting people to be activists?  Sound like 1965 all over again.</p>
<p>The blacks are absolutely panicking because of affirmative action, money and favoritism for hispanics.  Move over black activists, you had your 25 years of privilege.  The elites have found another race to favor.</p>

<p>Posted by at 10:54 AM on November 28 </p>
<p>Yep. Exactly.</p>
<p>But not only that.  What Blacks also have to deal with is the fact that many Whites who are not part of the Elite (which obviously is the majority of Whties) have long since given up them.  </p>
<p>Those Whites are exhausted from the whole race experiment gone bad thing.  They either have Compassion Fatigue or are just plain fed up.</p>
<p>And they would be that way even if things were going well in America.  But they are not.</p>
<p>Our own culture is not in the best shape from Family to Education to the Workplace to our relationships with Business and Government and back again to the most important relationship of all, ie; The relationship we have with ourselves, as individuals, and as a group.</p>
<p>Then there are the problems of the economy, created by outsourcing, the War in the Middle East, and of course, immigration.  Not to mention the relentless browbeating of the <span class="caps">MSM </span>and their insults, threats, or worse.</p>
<p>We are really up against it, and simply have no choice but to do something about it and quick.</p>
<p>With all of that going on, Who has time to continue engaging in this twisted, no-win relationship of enabling a people who despise us?</p>
<p>It might not be the best analogy but it will serve.  Anyway, the relationship between Whites and Blacks today is that of a couple who have split because one of them dumped the other.  And they dumped the other because their behavior and attitude was out of control.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call the one dumped the guy and the one doing the dumping the girl.</p>
<p>Immediately after dumping the guy for obnoxious behavior the girl goes through a personal crisis.  Thinking the guy is out of her life he shows up at the door, TO <span class="caps">ARROGANTLY DEMAND</span> TO BE <span class="caps">TAKEN BACK.</span> No regard for her present dilemna, nothing.  Just take, take, take or &#8220;gimme, gimme, gimme.&#8221;</p>
<p>For me, as someone raised in the 70&rsquo;s to think my lifes goal was to help Black people (in spite of being poor myself) Blacks are as dead as the Right and the Left.  </p>
<p>And I have the same feeling of relief that one has when they dump a boyfriend or girlfriend.  I feel NO guilt, no shame, none of the compulsory emotions.  Instead I have my own emotional and intellectual life and it&rsquo;s great!</p>

					<p>I think that this 100-man &#8220;vanguard&#8221; will do an excellent job&hellip; just long enough to secure federal funding for their program.  Then they will start using the money that they receive to distribute guns and drugs, just like that Muslim Bakery did in California.</p>
<p>They will basically become a federally funded gang.</p>

					<p>Ric Blair, I appreciate your willingness to at least engage some of my points, and make some counterpoints of your own. As you may have surmised, I have a response. My views are somewhat unorthodox, so I think most of the standard arguments made against liberals, feminists, marxists, etc. will not be relevant here, and we can all save time by not airing them.</p>
<p>To answer your question: The situation in New Orleans right now is so dire in the black areas that I think a militia, even a corrupt and sometimes violent militia, would make things better. Some kind of order needs to be restored, by some means within the black community. The fatal truth is that stability is require for growth, and the current city government and black leadership of New Orleans are unable to provide it.</p>
<p>Back to Philadelphia:<br>
If a poor, nearly all white area was facing drug problems, gangs, etc, I wouldn&rsquo;t want state employees, predominately of other races, carrying guns and trying to resolve the situation through the use of violence against both legitimate criminals and innocent people.</p>
<p>This is the exact situation that Blacks in America face. And I think the brownshirts represented a basic improvement over the insolvent Wiemar Republic, and that the Red Guards represented a basic improvement over the backward and incompetent czarist regime <span class="caps">AND </span>the &#8220;democratic&#8221; non-government that followed it. </p>
<p>Almost all &#8220;democratically elected&#8221; black leaders are incompetent buffoons who have failed to understand the political wisdom of black leaders like W. E. B. Dubois or Malcom X, who despite some narrowness of vision, at least made progress. Instead, they&rsquo;re part of the same corrupt patronage machine that possesses no idea but one: keep getting re-elected.</p>
<p>If any black community is to deal on equal terms with others, they need to stop celebrating their criminals, take responsibility, and combine discipline with education. Maybe this can be a small step. </p>
<p>Extremist rhetoric from other black groups is essentially meaningless,  because they lack power to do anything other than make cosmetic changes that line the pockets of a few elites. All the while black males commit roughly half of all crimes, and while they prey on other races, it is other blacks who must endure the greatest part of this. Helping the black man change his culture and purge deviant elements from it helps everyone else, and I&rsquo;d rather deal with red guards than bloods, as I see substantive differences between the two. You can&rsquo;t have a cold war or detente with criminals, whereas politics is above all about practical activity.</p>

					<p>I really like the &#8220;Crossed Spears and the Shield&#8221; thing. They can now encourage &#8220;da youfs&#8221; to stop killing each other with guns. We&rsquo;ll be finding more White corpses with <br>
Assegais in their backs.<br><br>
A Muslim leading them. Another brilliant stroke! (No pun intended). </p>

					<p>&#8220;only an abject coward would be &ldquo;terrorized&rdquo; by the mere presence of a black man&#8221;. </p>
<p>Only an abject coward&hellip; and anyone above a one hundred IQ</p>
<p>&#8220;If a poor, nearly all white area was facing drug problems, gangs, etc, I wouldn&rsquo;t want state employees, predominately of other races, carrying guns and trying to resolve the situation&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>If a poor, nearly all white area was facing drug problems, gang problems, etc&hellip; every black within 500 miles would be literally salivating to move there and it wouldn&rsquo;t stay all white for long. Which ones have?</p>

<p>Absolutely not. Never, never never.  My favorite music is country western, celtic music and bagpipes and gregorian chant, Hayden, Handel, Mozart, Scarletti and anything medieval and renaissaince. All White heritage music.</p>
<p>And now that the hispanics have established a perimeter defense around my White (immigrant White, but White) neighborhood I don&rsquo;t even have to listen to occasional rap music howling and grunting from passing cars any more.</p>
<p>Rhyming is easy.  Just write the alphabet vertically on a piece of lined paper.  One letter for each line.  Then just go done the alphabet.  Take the word Care.  A air B bare or bear D Dare<br>
F Fair. Do it a few times and you no longer have to write it down.</p>

					<p>&#8221; I wouldn&rsquo;t want state employees, predominately of other races, &#8220;</p>
<p>And yet Whites are supposed to accept with enthusiasm a situation whereby every government agency is staffed by non Whites, many of whom don&rsquo;t even speak English.  </p>
<p>We are supposed to accept those surly, disfunctional black women who staff every government office and do everything possible to avoid doing their job when a White taxpayer needs something from medical records to a tax refund, anything at all.</p>
<p>We are supposed to go happily to the unemployment office to apply for unemployment and find that every person in the office is some sort of affirmative action non White female, most of whom are immigrants of dubious legality.</p>

					<p>What kind of backgrounds are these &#8220;10,000&#8221; going to have? Blacks who have grown up in ghetto/prison culture have a certain outlook that has ended up prevailing when something like this is tried  &mdash;  Nation of Islam is a good example.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see what they can do this time, and hope for a (pleasant) surprise.</p>

					<p>Instead of training their neighborhood watch commandos to be &#8220;friendly and nonconfrontational&#8221; they should have focused on their young thugs and taught them the same lesson from birth. Friendly and nonconfrontational young blacks wouldn&rsquo;t rob, rape, carjack, steal, sell drugs etc, etc, etc. </p>

					<p>It makes me sick how many of you are negative about this. We all complain about how violent blacks are, then you all complain when they are trying to do something about it.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t win in some of your eyes, it&rsquo;s scary.  I totally hate black culture and what it has done to our country, but damn, if they acted responsibly than I wouldn&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>This may or may not work, but bravo for the effort.</p>

					<p>  A lot of what I post is deferred or declined, not censored . They choose what&rsquo;s pertinent . It&rsquo;s a thousand times more civilized . The liberal sites that post everything are barbaric melees .And if conservatives ever just give up without resisting that is what our lives will be like .</p>

<p>These guys are black muslims.  Their do gooderism is just a front. The black muslims are a criminal gang heavily into exortion, drug and gun dealing, fencing stolen goods, hijacking cars welfare and disability fraud etc.</p>
<p>According to some White philly police officers, the muslims created this as a way of eliminating other criminal black gangs.</p>
<p>Also by presenting themselves as a non profit do gooder group, they are eligible for millions of dollars in tax empt funding.</p>

					<p>Waage:</p>
<p>	I&rsquo;m not sure what your point is, so I can only speak to individual parts of your message.</p>
<p>	First, Hitler was brought to power by Ernst Rohm and his Storm Troopers, who generated enough confusion to convince people to accept Hitler, hoping he&rsquo;d deliver peace and quiet. What he did in fact deliver was a world war, extermination camps, book burning, massive repression, ruined cities all over the world. To say it was &ldquo;better&rdquo; than what had prevailed in the Weimar Republic is to say that economic security is better than human rights of any sort, no matter how feeble they might be. (And while we are on the subject, are you, the man making excuses for Nazi storm troopers, the same guy who accused your opponents of being genocidal two days ago?)</p>
<p>	Second, if you believe there is justice to be had from hired muscle, or for hired muscle, remember the case of Ernst Rohm, who was murdered by Hitler when he assumed power, because Adolph didn&rsquo;t care for the prospect of paying his political debts. His army of thugs was then hunted down and exterminated by legitimate agents of the state. Which is exactly what happened to the Old Bolsheviks who brought Lenin to power.</p>
<p>	Third, the people of New Orleans put themselves in the jackpot when they declared it was the government&rsquo;s job to rescue them from the folly of their refusal to face reality. They did not decamp, they were forced from their homes and they sat awaiting handouts from Uncle Sam, making no attempts to help themselves. The misery was amplified by the jungle atmosphere that prevailed in the sports arena where so many sought refuge, and where so many were victimized by the robbers and rapists among them. That savagery still prevails in the city, and vigilantes could only worsen things. Confusion can be remedied only when all citizens agree to obey the law, and to support those who enforce the law, without exception or excuse.</p>
<p>	The danger presented by uniformed thugs lies in the attitude that makes them possible, the public declaration that because the law has not been enforced to their satisfaction the law no longer applies to them. That conviction makes private armies a certainty and civil disorder unavoidable. When a free people lose faith in their government it languishes; when they withdraw support from those who keep order, it shatters and dies. In that, I agree with you. Stability is the first priority. But street gangs can&rsquo;t establish stability, no matter what logo they have on their hats.<br>
