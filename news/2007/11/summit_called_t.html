<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Every time state schools chief Jack O&rsquo;Connell thought he was doing something to close the achievement gap, a new round of test scores showed that black and Latino students had gained no ground on their white and Asian American peers.</p>
<p>Like many educators, O&rsquo;Connell assumed the culprit was poverty. Then he noticed an even wider ethnic disparity among students who were not poor.</p>
<p>The realization was a jolt: Being black or Latino &mdash; not poor &mdash; was what the low-scorers had in common. And it changed everything.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell now believes that widespread cultural ignorance within the California school system is responsible for the poor academic performance of many black and Latino students in school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The achievement gap is &#8220;absolutely, positively not genetic,&#8221; O&rsquo;Connell said. &#8220;All kids can learn. I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that until last year, he presided over a school-ranking system that let ethnic groups of students achieve at a slower pace than schools as a whole had to do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell and top educators in the California Department of Education have taken hours of racial sensitivity training, which O&rsquo;Connell wants to extend to teachers statewide. He&rsquo;s also reorganized the state Department of Education to focus on raising the test scores of black and Latino students.</p>
<p>And now he is taking it to the people with a two-day conference on race and the achievement gap.</p>
<p>Hundreds of experts from around the country will offer 125 different panels with such titles as &#8220;A Mindset is a Difficult Thing to Change,&#8221; and &#8220;Policies that Support the Academic Development of Urban Black Males.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some 4,000 people &mdash; teachers, principals, lawyers, school secretaries and others &mdash; will pack into the Sacramento Convention Center on Tuesday and Wednesday for what is being billed as an Achievement Gap Summit.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include talk-show host Tavis Smiley; &#8220;Stand and Deliver&#8221; actor Edward James Olmos; and Nicolina Hernandez, who founded the San Joaquin Valley University Project while in high school to help students apply to college.</p>
<p>Also on center stage will be Glenn Singleton, the coach O&rsquo;Connell hired for the Education Department&rsquo;s racial sensitivity classes. Singleton runs a San Francisco consulting firm called Pacific Educational Group and is the author of &#8220;Courageous Conversations about Race: a Strategy for Achieving Equity in Schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrary to widely held views that parents play a strong role in whether their children do well academically, Singleton believes the schools, not parents, are the biggest influence.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we were to say that black or brown kids don&rsquo;t perform as well because of their parents, we&rsquo;re saying black and brown parents aren&rsquo;t as effective as white parents,&#8221; Singleton told The Chronicle. &#8220;That&rsquo;s pretty much a racist statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>At schools with large numbers of black and Latino students, white teachers are not only culturally unfamiliar with their students, they are often the &#8220;least seasoned and skilled&#8221; at teaching, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think we believe that race is the issue,&#8221; said Dean Vogel, vice president of the vast California Teachers Association, who speculated that O&rsquo;Connell is using the topic to gain exposure for a possible run for governor.</p>
<p>Vogel disputed one of the most common examples of inequity cited by Singleton and others: that labor contracts &mdash; which let experienced teachers choose where they work &mdash; contribute to the achievement gap because the veterans typically aim for high-performing schools with few black and Latino students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard people say they don&rsquo;t want to work with those kids,&#8221; Vogel said. &#8220;They say, &lsquo;I want to work somewhere where I have enough materials, where the heater works and the roof doesn&rsquo;t leak, and where there&rsquo;s a manageable class size.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>By coincidence, he said, that isn&rsquo;t where most black and Latino students go to school.</p>
<p>Fixing those inequities &mdash; not focusing on race &mdash; is the way to close the achievement gap, Vogel said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet another cause of the racial achievement gap is neighborhood violence, say school counselors and mental health experts.</p>
<p>That topic is missing from O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s achievement gap conference. But student mental health is the &#8220;pink elephant&#8221; in the room that no one talks about, said Pia Escudero, of the Los Angeles Unified School District&rsquo;s Crisis Counseling and Intervention Services.</p>
<p>About 30 percent of children living in violent urban neighborhoods have post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, according to the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a division of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

<div class="infobox"><h3 style="infobox">English scores illustrate gap </h3><p>To see a measure of the achievement gap, The Chronicle looked at the English portion of the 2007 California Standards Test, taken by 4.7 million students last spring.
