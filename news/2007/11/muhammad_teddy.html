<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A British schoolteacher has been arrested in Sudan accused of insulting Islam&rsquo;s Prophet, after she allowed her pupils to name a teddy bear Muhammad.</p>
<p>Colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, 54, from Liverpool, said she made an &#8220;innocent mistake&#8221; by letting the six and seven-year-olds choose the name.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons was arrested after several parents made complaints.</p>
<p>The BBC has learned the charge could lead to six months in jail, 40 lashes or a fine.</p>
<p>Officials from the British embassy in Khartoum are expected to visit Ms Gibbons in custody later.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in contact with the authorities here and they have visited the teacher and she is in a good condition,&#8221; an embassy spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the naming of the teddy happened months ago and was chosen by the children because it is a common name in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;This happened in September and the parents did not have a problem with it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Very sensitive&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The school has been closed until January for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>Fellow teachers at Khartoum&rsquo;s Unity High School told Reuters news agency they feared for Ms Gibbons&rsquo; safety after receiving reports that men had started gathering outside the police station where she was being held.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s director, Robert Boulos, said: &#8220;This is a very sensitive issue. We are very worried about her safety.</p>
<p>They came up with eight names including Abdullah, Hassan and Muhammad</p>
<p>Mr Boulos said Ms Gibbons was following a British national curriculum course designed to teach young pupils about animals and this year&rsquo;s topic was the bear.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons, who joined the school in August, asked a seven-year-old girl to bring in her teddy bear and asked the class to pick names for it, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came up with eight names including Abdullah, Hassan and Muhammad,&#8221; Mr Boulos said, adding that she then had the children vote on a name.</p>
<p>Twenty out of the 23 children chose Muhammad as their favourite name.</p>
<p>Mr Boulos said each child was then allowed to take the bear home at weekends and told to write a diary about what they did with it.</p>
<p>He said the children&rsquo;s entries were collected in a book with a picture of the bear on the cover and a message which read, &#8220;My name is Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Book seized</b></p>
<p>The bear itself was not marked or labelled with the name in any way, he added.</p>
<p>It is seen as an insult to Islam to attempt to make an image of the Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p>Mr Boulos said Ms Gibbons was arrested on Sunday at her home inside the school premises after a number of parents complained to Sudan&rsquo;s Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>He said police had seized the book and asked to interview the girl who owned the bear.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s state-controlled Sudanese Media Centre reported that charges were being prepared &#8220;under article 125 of the criminal law&#8221; which covers insults against faith and religion.</p>
<p>No-one at the ministries of education or justice was available for comment.</p>
<p>Mr Boulos told the BBC he was confident she would not face a jail sentence.</p>
<p>One Muslim teacher at the independent school for Christian and Muslim children, who has a child in Ms Gibbons&rsquo; class, said she had not found the project offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Gillian and she would never have meant it as an insult. I was just impressed that she got them to vote,&#8221; the teacher said.</p>
<p>In Liverpool, a family spokeswoman said Ms Gibbons&rsquo; grown children, John and Jessica &mdash; both believed to be in their 20s &mdash; were not commenting on her arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spoken with her children and they do not want to say anything and aggravate the situation over there,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rick Widdowson the headteacher of Garston Church of England Primary School, where Gillian worked for ten years, added: &#8220;We are an Anglican school and I know for a fact that Gillian would not do anything to offend followers of any faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly she is also very worldly wise and she is obviously aware of the sensitivities around Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad printed in several European newspapers sparked violent protests around the world in 2006.</p>
