<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>A deadly and highly unusual melee among 30 young women in South Los Angeles was triggered by a dispute over a man who dated two of the female combatants, Los Angeles police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Many of the women, while not gang members, had ties to men who belonged to gangs, police said. The two groups, authorities said, arranged to meet near Slauson and Western avenues to discuss the romantic triangle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the height of the confrontation, a woman from one group got into her convertible, screamed and rammed the vehicle into the crowd, police said. Shontae Treniece Blanche, 22, an expectant mother and part-time student at Cal State Northridge, was struck and killed. A second woman was critically injured.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, authorities announced that they had taken the driver into custody and booked her on suspicion of murder. According to police, the driver, Unique Kiana Bishop, 21, fled the scene but showed up at the 77th Street Division station with her mother. Police officials said Bishop told them that she struck the crowd by accident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gannon said &#8220;the discussion turned to yelling and soon the fists began to fly.&#8221; Witnesses gave varying estimates of the number of women involved in the brawl, which took place in a gas station parking lot, with estimates ranging from 12 to 30 women fighting.</p>
<p>Blanche, Gannon said, went to the gas station with a friend and got involved in the argument. Then, Gannon said, Bishop got into her car and drove into the other group of women, killing Blanche and pinning another woman against another vehicle, injuring her critically. Although authorities initially feared that the injured woman would lose her leg, they said Tuesday that surgeons managed to save the limb.</p>
<p>Police, clarifying and expanding on initial accounts of the incident, said Blanche was trapped under Bishop&rsquo;s convertible after being struck. Gannon said the suspect, apparently trying to free Blanche&rsquo;s body from the car, &#8220;drove backward over her body, running over her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before speeding away.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the eyewitnesses said the suspect screamed as she drove through the gas station &mdash; something to the effect, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get you,&rsquo;&#8221; Gannon said.</p>
<p>Bishop has been convicted twice of burglary and once of petty theft in the last two years, police said. Her latest conviction came after a July 26 arrest for burglary in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>She spent 14 days in jail and was placed on probation after being convicted in the Norwalk branch of Los Angeles County Superior Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Hayes, both of Blanche&rsquo;s parents had been in and out of prison since Blanche was a young child.</p>
<p>Blanche, who was five months&rsquo; pregnant and married to a man in prison, was looking forward to a future as a mother and to graduating from Cal State Northridge.</p>
<p>She hoped to become a parole officer and was 13 classes away from that goal, said a cousin, Argentine Hayes, 21.</p>

					<p>A college student with a &#8220;record&#8221;, felon as parents and a baby daddy in prison.  Yeah I am sure that she would have made a great contribution to society.  I have seen this sort of thing before with the Black women fighting over these thug, losers and it just blows my mind.  </p>

					<p>People who do not live in California or who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Los Angeles, have no idea. No idea at all. It is a place that is beyond most of the middle class&rsquo;s immagination. Forget about the upper classes, they are simply clueless, as they are with illegal immigration and most everything else that is happening in the United States that doesn&rsquo;t involve money.</p>

<p>Guess blacks can&rsquo;t stay away from the criminal justice business, whether working for it or incarcerated by it.  It also proves that education does not develop common sense.  What was a pregnant woman doing near this event?  These people defy all logic.</p>

					<p>All this is illustrative of the educational gap in this country, I honestly think there is no man worth a conflict like thisand I say that as a man. But I don&rsquo;t think Melinda Gates would go bannanas like this if her husband Bill was on an inappropriate Realtime video, even though clearly she would potentially have a greater loss than any of the 50 or so women.</p>

<p>Our tax dollars hard at work.</p>
<p>The sad truth is, all this kind of government spending is not considered as part of the welfare subsidy whites are required to pay to blacks, (or counted towards their demands for reparations).</p>

<p>&#8220;According to Hayes, both of Blanche&rsquo;s parents had been in and out of prison since Blanche was a young child.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have never known anyone who was 5 months pregnant and married to a man in prison.  I have never known anyone who has been in prison.  Neither my wife, nor my daughter ever been involved and a street fight.  </p>

					<p>If anyone wants a glimpse into the life of Unique Kiana Bishop, here is <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=100969256" rel="nofollow">her MySpace page</a>.  She seems like such a demure and refined young lady, it&rsquo;s hard to believe she would be involved in such shenanigans.  Perhaps it was just my White Racist Thoughtwaves that forced her to run over those people.  I&rsquo;m sorry, really.<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, convicted <span class="caps">TWICE </span>for burglary and <span class="caps">ONCE </span>for petty theft? Doesn&rsquo;t that add up to <span class="caps">THREE</span>? I thought California had a <span class="caps">THREE </span>strikes and you&rsquo;re out law. I guess this means you&rsquo;re <span class="caps">OUT </span>on the streets instead of in prison.

					<p>13 classes away from becoming a parole officer?  What&rsquo;s that, two or three years before Shontae Treniece would have plunked her backside in a chair and started working on her pension?  How will her husband support himself when he gets out of prison?  What a loss!<br>
     And poor little Unique, only 21, and only two felony convictions.  I&rsquo;ll bet her parents are just decimated.  <br><br>
     White society has failed these girls, by not sterilizing their parents years ago.  </p>

					<p>In Chicago on Michigan Avenue downtown, I once observed two African-American women fighting (actually, one of the woman had grabbed the other by the hair and wouldn&rsquo;t let go) while the black man they were apparently fighting over was standing beside his car with a grin on his face. Why black women consider black men something worthy of engaging in physical combat over is something I can&rsquo;t fathom.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What IS IT <span class="caps">WITH </span>blacks and the idiotic, ridiculous, imbecelic names they give themselves?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&rsquo;ve been over this many, many times through the years on AmRen (and other places). One of us even compiled an entire list of insane black names. It was one of the more humorous threads on here.</p>
<p>I used to get ticked off at all these names and then I used to laugh at them. For the past few years, I&rsquo;m simply glad they DO give their kids ludicrous names (because their lives are so empty, they have to have <i>something</i> to prop their egos up).</p>
<p>The reasons are obvious:</p>
<p><b>1.)</b> Since the entire <span class="caps">MSM </span>will <span class="caps">NEVER </span>mention the race of a minority criminal (but will trumpet that fact in case the perp is white), just listing the names of any black or brown person will identify them immediately.</p>
<p><b>2.)</b> These people can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t assimilate into our society and this just helps further alienate themselves   &mdash;   which is a <span class="caps">GOOD </span>thing&hellip;</p>

					<p>When I first heard of this, I figured it was between groups of Norwegian and Swedish girls in a dispute over the relative merits of lutefish.  But then I read the names:  &ldquo;Shontae&rdquo; - &ldquo;Treniece&rdquo; - &ldquo;Argentine&rdquo; - &ldquo;Unique&rdquo; - &ldquo;Kiana&rdquo; and abandoned that idea. What a shock!</p>

					<p>Come on, it&rsquo;s not nice to make fun of people. There is a perfectly good explanation why African Americans have these types of names. </p>
<p>They were dragged here as slaves and forced to take the master&rsquo;s name. After being in the US for so long, most African Americans have no link back to Africa and has zero family information.  </p>
<p>The attempt to differentiate oneself, to have something unique to themselves as a culture, to separate one&rsquo;s identity from a hostile majority is very human. U</p>
<p>nfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t very helpful for them when they do use &#8220;black&#8221; names. Many educated African American educators and leaders also bemoan this fact and loss of competitiveness through the use of &#8220;black&#8221; names. Just cut them some slack here. I just don&rsquo;t believe in affirmative action for other areas of life.</p>

					<p>I <b>highly</b> suggest you read the original article from the vastly left-wing and anti-white <i><span class="caps">L.A.</span> Times</i> and the accompanying side articles.</p>
<p>One tiny snippet from the original article (so typical):</p>
<p>&#8220;<i><b>Neighborhood activists</b> joined mourners&hellip;.&rsquo;This says <b>nothing</b> about the neighborhood&hellip;&rsquo;</i>&#8221;<br>
[No, of course not. Nothing ever says anything about &#8216;da hood.&rsquo;]</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; For 40-45 years, there have been these ubiquitous &#8216;Neighborhood Activists&rsquo; in the ghettoes. Next time you take out the garbage, look up and down your block. You see any &#8216;Neighborhood Activists&rsquo; on your block? Have you <span class="caps">EVER </span>seen any &#8216;Neighborhood Activists&rsquo;? Does anybody need to actually answer that question as to why not!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always amazing that there are so many people who are &#8216;Neighborhood Activists&rsquo; in the hood. I mean, without welfare, how exactly would you support yourself as a professional &#8216;Neighborhood Activist&rsquo;?  [sarcasm] I&rsquo;ve applied for that position many times, but I keep getting turned down and I can&rsquo;t figure out why. [/sarcasm]</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even bother me so much if those professional &#8216;Neighborhood Activists&rsquo; actually <span class="caps">DID </span>something worthwhile, other than blame the white man for all their ills. But of course, nothing&rsquo;s ever gotten better. It&rsquo;s so bad now, that people look back on the Watts riots of &#8216;65 as if it were a Sunday picnic.</p>
<p>Death is so ho-hum now, so nonchalant, that it only makes the sidebar of the story above. Like the poster &#8216;Bobby&rsquo; from above said, people not from Cali have NO clue as to what goes on there <span class="caps">EVERY DAY.</span></p>
<p>This is the list of <b><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/homicidereport/" rel="nofollow">Murders for <span class="caps">JUST </span>the Last Two Weeks in <span class="caps">L.A.</span></a></b> for anyone who thinks I&rsquo;m exaggerating or embellishing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the one thing that stands out by its conspicuous absence in that endless report???</p>

					<p>&#8220;Blanche&rsquo;s grandmother and cousin remembered her as a popular girl and bank worker who was determined to avoid trouble. &#8220;She would tell me, &#8216;I&rsquo;m not going to be like my mom,&rsquo; &#8221; said Helen Hayes, 60, who raised her granddaughter. According to Hayes, both of Blanche&rsquo;s parents had been in and out of prison since Blanche was a young child. Blanche, who was five months&rsquo; pregnant and married to a man in prison, was looking forward to a future as a mother and to graduating from Cal State Northridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the description of the innocent victim! (The description of the perp is of course worse).</p>
<p>A cousin of the victim said, &#8220;She didn&rsquo;t carry around guns&hellip;She didn&rsquo;t carry around knives or razors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, a model kid.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s earlier statement is poignant, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to be like my mom.&#8221; (who was in jail). </p>
<p>Children used to often say, &#8220;I want to be like my Mom (or Dad).&#8221; But <span class="caps">THESE </span>kids&rsquo; parents are role models of how <span class="caps">NOT </span>to be. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the numerous little personal details (relatives in jail, married to a man in prison, pregnant, &#8220;&hellip;didn&rsquo;t carry around guns&hellip;knives or razors,&#8221; prior convictions for the perp) in this article that make it such a wonderful description of exactly what black ghetto society is now.</p>
<p>Oh, excuse me, I&rsquo;m wrong about that:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This says nothing about the neighborhood,&rsquo; said Noreen McClendon, executive director of Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>

					<p>This country once sought to reach for the stars, to be tops in everything we undertook. Now, stories like this prove that we have sunk to the depths. Hopefully, there is a way out. But, for some reason, ourleaders will not step up and set an example. They have abandoned us.</p>

					<p><i>If anyone wants a glimpse into the life of Unique Kiana Bishop, here is her MySpace page. She seems like such a demure and refined young lady, it&rsquo;s hard to believe she would be involved in such shenanigans. Perhaps it was just my White Racist Thought waves that forced her to run over those people. I&rsquo;m sorry, really.</i></p>
<p><i>Posted by <span class="caps">LMWAO </span>at 8:44 PM on November 7 </i></p>
<p><span class="caps">LMWAO</span>:  Wow - thank you for posting that webpage.  Every time I think I grasp the depths of depravity and stupidity of these ghetto mamas, I read something like that MySpace page and am shocked once more.  It&rsquo;s unbelievable!   </p>
<p>Can you even imagine what type of woman has a chance to present a summary of herself on her webage and writes <i>that &#8220;About Me&#8221; description???</i>  It is just beyond my comprehension.  </p>
<p>For anthropological reasons, everyone on Amren should read it - here is another link to that webpage:  <br>
<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=100969256" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=100969256</a></p>
<p>Every white parent in America should read through that little gem - understand that if you send your kids to public schools, or even many private schools that give &#8220;diversity scholarships&#8221;, your kids may end up sitting next to the children of Unique and her diverse buddies.  <i>What kind of stories do you think they will hear from these kids??</i>  How much depravity do you want your kids exposed to?</p>
<p>I dream of the day when all American white children will be homeschooled away from the spawn of thugs.  If you can&rsquo;t homeschool your kids yourself, find a homeschooling family in your community and pay them under the table to teach your child.  Think of it as a super-exclusive mini-private school.  They probably won&rsquo;t charge you very much, and it will help them out as well as providing excellent education to your children.  </p>
<p>The intellectual and moral development of white children is the most important thing in the world right now - it&rsquo;s our only chance for survival as a people.  The &#8220;Shontae&rdquo;, &ldquo;Treniece&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unique&rdquo; thugs are spreading to the suburbs and formerly white areas thanks to government policies and housing subsidies.  Keep your kids away from them!!  </p>

					<p>A poster above named of <span class="caps">LMWAO </span>offers a link to Unique Kiana Bishop&rsquo;s MySpace page. </p>
<p>I would really recommend a visit   &mdash;   at least to anyone with a sick sense of humor like mine. Spelling mistakes, complete lack of grammatical sense, aggressive tendencies, and all-round unmistakable <span class="caps">STUPIDITY </span>that emanates from every corner of her page, is really something to behold. </p>
<p>This lady is Unique, all right   &mdash;   uniquely moronic and uniquely dangerous. I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s off the streets   &mdash;   although I&rsquo;m sorry it took another woman&rsquo;s death to make that finally happen. </p>

<p>This is so typical of all these affirmative action law enforcement and other government workers.  The former police chief of Santa Monica ca. had 2 young adult children in jail at the same time.</p>
<p>Almost blacks have close relatives in the prison system.  If you work in an affirmative action workplace you have to hear them yapping about their baby daddies in prison all day long.<br>

					<p>u people seem to be the non-educated ones. i agree with mostly everything u have to say about blanche and bishop, but when u start disrespecting the whole african-american race then i have a problelm. our parents give us those names because we are unquie we are different and we dont wanna have the same name as everyone else. every white girl i come across name is becky, tiffany, amy, and all those other ridicilous names.u guys have to have give eachother numbers to know who is who becky 1, becky 2, or jennifer a. or jennifer b. we all are different and should embrace it. and if u wanna know where ur momma got the names natasha and jacquline they got it from the african american community. and one more thing you guys wish all african american acted in that matter but they dont. i am an intelligent black queen that has graduated from an accrediated university, and i would love to challenge any of you in a debate(u probablly aren&rsquo;t up for it because everyone knows white peopl are inferior to intelligent african americans.</p>

					<p>When I first heard of this, I figured it was between groups of Norwegian and Swedish girls in a dispute over the relative merits of lutefish. But then I read the names: &ldquo;Shontae&rdquo; - &ldquo;Treniece&rdquo; - &ldquo;Argentine&rdquo; - &ldquo;Unique&rdquo; - &ldquo;Kiana&rdquo; and abandoned that idea. What a shock!</p>

					<p>Talk about stereotypes Beautiful black queen. I know black women call white women Becky&rsquo;s, and not surprisingly you refer to that name in your post. I&rsquo;m White, and haven&rsquo;t known all that many Becky&rsquo;s in my life. However, I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have heard black names I could barely pronounce, that had to be made up in the delivery room. You might call it Unique, I call it Ghetto. I can also assure you of this, and employer would rather hirer a Becky over a Shawntiqua.</p>

So queen,  are Amreners to believe you and your sista Unique are intellectually gifted?  You <span class="caps">DID </span>read Unique&rsquo;s blog didn&rsquo;t you? Where are all the &#8220;intelligent&#8221; blacks with superior intellectual skills?  Are they hiding somewhere?  Why don&rsquo;t they come out and speak out against the low class, low life thuggery so many of their &#8220;sistas&#8221; and &#8220;bruthas&#8221; thrive on?  </p>
<p>Apparently you attended a <span class="caps">HBCU </span>or a particularly &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; leftist institution whose mantra is &#8220;let in the oppressed people of color&#8221;.

College educated individuals normally have sufficient grammatical and spelling skills which enable them to express a thought coherently.  Properly educated individuals with a command of the English language-</p>
<p>1) do not use run on sentences,<br>
2) utilize proper punctuation,<br><br>
3) capitalize the beginning of a sentence,as well as proper nouns, such as an individual&rsquo;s name,<br><br>
4) ensure subject/verb agreement,<br><br>
5) do not use conjunctions to begin a sentence.</p>
<p>You, my dear, are apparently either lazy or lack proper education and etiquette.  When you post to a site, please have the courtesy to write your arguments so that the reader doesn&rsquo;t have to wade through grammatical and spelling errors.</p>

<p>Have you no shame?  The deceased cannot speak for themselves and can do nothing while they are mocked by the living.</p>

<p>White people don&rsquo;t usually dislike blacks because of the color of their skin.  The disdain comes from observed behaviors, first-hand experience, and the <span class="caps">FACT </span>that some blacks can make a living off of telling another race that they are a scourge.  The lack of ambition, care for others, and bad attitudes is the at the core of black America&rsquo;s problems.  Only they choose to blame it all on Whitey.  As I have stated here before, the everyday Amrener is simply looking for blacks to assume responsibility for their own communities, children, and future.  For them to revisit the past on ever possible occassion, to blame the White man, is a screeching record that has been going on for far too long.</p>
<p>The black man is not the White man&rsquo;s worst enemy.  The White man&rsquo;s worst enemy is race trading, spineless, fellow Whites that feel the need to atone for past acts committed by us, at our expense.  The only race that seems to feel the need to be tolerant and bend their rules are Whites.  Luckily, with websites like this one, once shut eyes are beginning to open to this hypocrisy.  </p>

<p>Sorry, Yellow Man. I imagine many of us did feel a twinge of sadness for the victim, but we are gathered here not to pay our respects to the many departed, but to note the patterns of personal and social dysfunction and criminality that dispatch them and that threaten ourselves and the community we&rsquo;d like to build.</p>
<p>Of the 45 comments so far posted, I could find only two (my own and one other) that could possibly be construed as &#8220;making fun&#8221; of the victim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in this strange modern time that we are expected to be wracked with pain for the suffering of every living creature. Sixty years ago this article, with its comments about the victim being married to a prisoner but wanting to become a parole officer, and her being a peaceful person as reflected in her not carrying guns, knives, or razors, would have been regarded as ironical per se, without the need of any ironical comment from readers.</p>

					<p>The names are just another sub-cultural symptom of black racism and hatred of whites, and they chose bizzarre names precisely because they want to avoid giving their children &#8220;white&#8221; names.</p>
<p>See, for them everything truly is based in race consciousness and race revenge - and that is the backward reason so many refuse to integrate themselves and build independent, decent lives within the main culture.  </p>

Your feelings do you credit, but at the same time, people&rsquo;s brains don&rsquo;t turn off when the subject is a dead person. And while you&rsquo;re right that dead people can&rsquo;t defend themselves, it seems to me that more damage is done by making fun of living people, who can still be hurt. The law recognizes this, when it says that you can&rsquo;t libel the dead.</p>
