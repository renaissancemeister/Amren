<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>More than half of new jobs created under Labour since 1997 have gone to foreign workers, it has emerged.</p>
<p>The government had previously claimed the majority of new jobs had been filled by British workers.</p>
<p>This appeared to be supported by figures released on Monday, despite the government admitting it had underestimated the number of migrants.</p>
<p>But it later put out a clarification suggesting 52% &mdash; or 1.1 million &mdash; of new jobs created had gone to migrants.</p>
<p>BBC economics editor Evan Davies said the figures were &#8220;a major admission for a government that has been going on about British jobs for British workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said &#8220;foreign workers create jobs as well as fill them&#8221; and they had benefited the UK economy.</p>
<p><b>Smith apology</b></p>
<p>But the government&rsquo;s figures were &#8220;chaotic&#8221; and they proved it was &#8220;difficult to keep track of everyone&#8221;.</p>
<p>The government has always maintained migrant workers benefit the economy, but that the majority of new jobs are still being filled by the indigenous UK population.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Jacqui Smith earlier apologised for underestimating the number of migrant workers &mdash; but insisted &#8220;many more&#8221; jobs had been filled by British nationals than those coming from abroad since 1997.</p>
<p>Ms Smith told the BBC: &#8220;Of course it is bad that these figures are wrong and ministers have apologised for that, I am sorry about that.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the important point is that actually there are 2.7 million more jobs in this country than there were in 1997.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s more jobs, yes, that have been filled by those that have come from abroad, but many more jobs that have been filled by UK nationals, and vacancies still out there for UK nationals.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that a points-based system for migrant workers would be introduced next year to ensure &#8220;stronger control&#8221; over those coming to the UK.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Shambles&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>On Monday, Labour said 800,000 &mdash; or 30% &mdash; of the 2.7 million jobs created had been taken by migrant workers. It later revised this to 1.1 million.</p>
<p>Then in a further correction, it said the wrong population estimates had been used to calculate the percentage of new jobs taken by migrants.</p>
<p>It said 2003 estimates &mdash; which predict 2.1 million new jobs would be created in the economy &mdash; should be used rather than the 2007 figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of that 2.1 million increase, about 1 million has been accounted for by UK nationals and about 1.1 million by foreign nationals,&#8221; it said in an explanatory note.</p>
<p>The Conservatives described the situation as a &#8220;shambles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: &#8220;It is not good enough for the home secretary to apologise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government should be open about telling the truth before they are pressurised into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration policy has been out of control for a decade and, if you can&rsquo;t count migration, you certainly can&rsquo;t control it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Urgent review&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In a further development, a Parliamentary answer obtained by the Conservatives has revealed 1.5 million foreign-born workers have come to work in Britain in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Shadow Pensions Secretary Chris Grayling said: &#8220;This situation just gets worse; it&rsquo;s clear we simply can&rsquo;t trust the figures or statements put out by the government on migrant workers in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ministers need to carry out an urgent review of how they handle this data and need to clear up once and for all how many people come to work in Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Department of Work and Pensions has said the 1.5 million figure refers to all overseas-born people entering the UK to work since 1997.</p>
<p>It could, for example, mean UK passport holders born abroad who enter the UK to work.</p>

					<p>Here in S. California outside of attorneys and entertainment industry workers, I would have to say that at least 90 percent of jobs go to immigrants.</p>

					<p>The funny thing is that Gordon Brown&rsquo;s big idea was the so-called &#8216;New Deal&rsquo; scheme in which billions upon billions of pounds worth of taxpayer&rsquo;s money was used in an attempt to get the long-term British unemployed into work.<br>
As ever with this wretched &#8216;New Labour&rsquo; Government, the right-hand does&rsquo;t know what the left hand is doing, and the open-door immigration policy has effectively negated the &#8216;New Deal&rsquo; program thus consigning huge wealth directly onto the garbage dump.<br><br>
A similiar story for a whole host of other downright incompetent &#8216;New labour&rsquo; policies from the billions wasted in education on non-performing &#8216;academies&rsquo; - their academic performance is worse than the schools they replaced, and the billions wasted on the <span class="caps">NHS </span>to little effect, other than boosting <span class="caps">GP&rsquo;</span>s salaries.<br><br>
When will the British people finally rumble these half-witted clowns and kick them out?</p>

					<p>Remember who is causing all these two-legged &#8220;imports,&#8221; it&rsquo;s your greedy businessperson who claims that the Natives are stupid, lazy and not compliant enough to kiss the bottom of their tassled loafers.</p>

					<p>The sheer depth of inaptitude, incompetence, deceit (coverup) <span class="caps">AND </span>absolute treachery of our treasonist native elite regardless of political hue, is utterly breathtaking in the extreme.</p>
<p>They just have to be ousted, rounded up and tried for treason.  Such a policy is absolutely imperative no matter how this urgent goal is achieved.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;But the important point is that actually there are 2.7 million more jobs in this country than there were in 1997.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Unless <span class="caps">PROOF </span>can be furnished to substantiate such a claim then it must be deemed false in the meantime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <b>how many more</b> immigrants have invaded the UK in that same ten years?</p>
<p>Well!  </p>
<p>Oh yes, lest we forget, <b>nobody amongst our governing elite has the faintest idea as to what the real figures involved might be!!!</b></p>
<p>In other words, <b>the alleged figure of 2.7m of jobs created since 1997 comes to practically nothing when even only an approximate guess at the numbers involved in the dramatic increase of foreign immigration <span class="caps">AND </span>asylum, (more honestly described as invasion), into the United Kingdom during that same period, is taken into consideration.</b> <br>

<p>Yeah, and the moon is made of green cheese.  Labour havent got a clue about anything.  The last 10 years in Britain has been a big social experiment.  Millions spent on &#8220;initiatives&#8221; and &#8220;enquiries&#8221; while people die by the thousand <span class="caps">AFTER </span>being treated in hospital, from <span class="caps">MRSA </span>and C-Diff.  There is so much wrong in once-Great Britain, its hard to know where to start.  Just think, we gave the world a language, law, culture, railways, engineering, medicine, literature, now its a held together with string and sellotape.  My Grandfathers both fought in <span class="caps">WW2, </span>to keep this country free and British, and its been signed away with the stroke of a pen and the clink of a champagne glass. Gordon Brown, you and your whole government are a bunch of yellow bellied traitors.     </p>

					<p>Yeah I really have to stay the past 10 years of labour government, mass invasion, hate crimes legislation etc. has been an absolute travesty. The most catastrophic period in this countries history since the Norman conquest.</p>

					<p>What I really cannot understand is this:<br>
The British Government when pressed simply holds up its hands and shamelessly says &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t have a clue about the number of legal migrants who have entered the country&#8221;.<br><br>
What utter, utter nonsense.<br><br>
THe fact is that today&rsquo;s business world is dominated by multinational companies with enormous cash turnovers - the turnovers are bigger in fact than the <span class="caps">GDP</span>s of many nations.All his money continually changing hands by the second, through myriads of accounts - it is the lifeblood of the business and extremely important as to what the <strong>exact</strong> sum of assets, liabilities etc are at anyone particular moment for a vast company whose tentacles stretch far and wide. Yet every big company in the worlkd manages to do this without exception - if a chief accountant couldn&rsquo;t find these figures nigh on instaneously, he would be sacked.<br><br>
  One would have thought that keeping a simple count of the travel document details at all ports of those coming in and out was a far simpler task.</p>

					<p>Of course, no real &#8216;Germanic&rsquo; nation (ie Germany, Austria, Switzerland) ever tolerates such slackness, sloppiness and ineptidude in public record keeping for longer than one second.<br>
  It is in these peoples&rsquo; blood to be precise methodical and efficient when keeping recors - especially records that are of such gravity.<br><br>
Try telling a German official that you &#8216;haven&rsquo;t got a clue&rsquo; about the job (you are paid a great deal of taxpayers&rsquo; money for doing) and see what his reply is.<br><br>
To say that you&rsquo;ll get you head bitten off is an understatement.</p>

					<p>Since 1945 Britain&rsquo;s car industry has been wiped out, as has its ship-building industry, its bus and truck industry, the textile industry, the shoe and footwear industry, the computer and electronics industry, most heavy and light engineering, construction is only a shadow of its pre-war strength.<br>
The reason why is primarily sloppy government incompetence as typified by the story above.</p>
