<h1><a href="http://euobserver.com/9/25115/?rk=1_">Far-Right European Parliament Group on Verge of Collapse</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Honor Mahony, EUObserver (Brussels), November 13, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The anti-immigrant far-right political group in the European Parliament is on the verge of collapse following internal fighting over comments made by an Italian member about Romanians and criminality.</p>
<p>The Greater Romania party on Thursday (7 November) announced that it was withdrawing its five members from the Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group following comments expressed by Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of the facist Il Duce, about Romanians after a much publicised murder of an Italian last week.</p>
<p>The suspected perpetrator is thought be a Romanian immigrant from the Roma community and prompted harsh rhetoric from far-right politicians in Italy, including Ms Mussonlini.</p>
<p>In response, a letter by the head of the Greater Romania party, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, states that &#8220;The unconsciousness of this lady [Ms Mussonlini] who makes easily generalisations, leaving to understand that all the Romanians are living like delinquents and are making dreadful crimes &mdash; remind us of her grandfather, the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini&hellip;&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the exit of the 5 Romanian MEPs, who became independent again, the Identity-Tradition Sovereignty group disappears,&#8221; says the letter.</p>
<p>According to Mr Vadim, whose own party has been regularly accused of racism, Ms Mussolini is quoted in Romanian newspapers as saying: &#8220;Breaking the law became a way of life for Romanians. However, it is not about petty crimes, but horrifying crimes, that gives one goose bumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later on Thursday, it emerged that the Romanians were considering trying to stay in the group but get Ms Mussolini removed &mdash; in this way the group would be able to continue to exist.</p>
<p>A decision is to be made next Tuesday. A spokesperson for the ITS group told EUobserver that they are going to &#8220;use the weekend&#8221; for negotiations and that it was &#8220;not possible to say&#8221; yet whether the group would survive.</p>
<p>Under EU assembly rules, a party must have at least 20 members from six member states.</p>
<p>The turmoil in the group &mdash; which was less than a year old &mdash; has already caused a certain amount of schadenfreude among officials and MEPs in the parliament.</p>
<p>Some already sent out press releases announcing welcoming the demise of the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watching these people argue amongst themselves warms the heart,&#8221; said Scottish MEP Alyn Smith in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The European Parliament is a home to Europe&rsquo;s democracy and it is right that all views are represented but I dislike everything these people stand for and am glad to see their group collapse,&#8221; continued the MEP.</p>
<p>The diverse group also houses politicians from France&rsquo;s and Belgium&rsquo;s anti-immigrant National Front and Vlaams Belang, as well as Andrew MÃ¶lzer (an Austrian MEP kicked out of a far-right party in Austria for being too extremist), Dimitar Stoyanov (a Bulgarian MEP who caused a ruckus in the parliament last year when he circulated a derogatory email about Roma people) and two Italian MEPs Luca Romagnoli and Alessandra Mussolini.</p>
<p>Another of its members, UK MEP Ashley Mote, is currently in jail for benefit fraud.</p>
<p>During its months as a group, it has failed to act as a coherent political faction appearing to bear out analysts predictions that its various parts have little to unite them.</p>
<p>Correction &mdash; An earlier version of this article stated that the group had already collapsed following the circulation of a letter stating that the Romanian MEPs had left the group. It has since been amended to reflect the fact that the Greater Romania MEPs have re-entered negotiations on the issue.</p>
