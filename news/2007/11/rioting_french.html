						<p>Police were on alert last night for a new flare-up of violence in the Paris suburbs, after the death of two teenagers in a crash with a police car sparked six hours of rioting by angry youths.</p>
<p>Gangs torched cars and looted shops and buildings in the north Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, injuring 25 police officers, following the death of the youths, aged 15 and 16, whose cross-country motorbike collided with a police car yesterday afternoon..</p>
<p>About 100 angry youths quickly gathered at the crash site, in a flashpoint high-rise housing estate, demanding the &#8220;truth&#8221; about the accident, as rioting spread across the town.</p>
<p>In 2005, the accidental death of two youths allegedly fleeing police in another north Paris suburb sparked three weeks of riots in suburban estates across France, the country&rsquo;s worst social unrest in decades.</p>
<p>Omar Sehhouli, the brother of one of the yesterday&rsquo;s victims, accused police of ramming the motorbike and of failing to assist the injured teens.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a failure to assist a person in danger .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is 100 per cent a (police) blunder. They know it, and that&rsquo;s why they did not stay at the scene,&#8221; he told France Info radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know they will say they left because they were afraid of clashes or of being assaulted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but up until now we have had no apology from the police chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said the bike smashed into the side of their car during a routine patrol of the neighbourhood. Neither youth was wearing a helmet, according to witnesses. An internal police investigation has been opened.</p>
<p>Officials reported at least seven arrests in Villiers-le-Bel as rioters torched two garages, a petrol pump and two shops, pillaged the railway station in neighbouring Arnouville and set fire to more than 20 cars.</p>
<p>Twenty-five police were injured in the violence, two seriously, as well as one firefighter, officials said. A police station in Villiers-le-Bel was set on fire and another in Arnouville was wrecked.</p>
<p>Police said there were reports of &#8220;small groups attacking shops, passers-by and car drivers&#8221; to rob them. One suspect was arrested carrying jewellery from a looted store, they said.</p>
<p>Mr Sehhouli said the rioting &#8220;was not violence but an expression of rage&#8221; and that he wanted the officers &#8220;responsible&#8221; for the accident to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Locals said rampaging youths had burnt cars to prevent police from entering the area. &#8220;Every time they try to do so, the youths charge with whatever they can lay their hands on,&#8221; one said.</p>
<p>Appealing for calm, the Mayor of Villers-le-Bel, Didier Vaillant, said he would ensure there was &#8220;an impartial investigation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Police and politicians warn that many French suburbs remain a &#8220;tinderbox&#8221; two years after riots that exposed France&rsquo;s failure to fully integrate the French-born descendants of African and Arab immigrants. But the national leader of the opposition Socialist Party, Francois Hollande, said the violence proved the &#8220;deep social crisis&#8221; of the suburbs had yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy, a former interior minister who is reviled in the suburbs for his tough stance on law and order and immigration, has promised a &#8220;Marshall Plan&#8221; to tackle exclusion and high unemployment in the suburbs.</p>
