<h1>Ex-NBA Player with at Least 8 Kids Files for Bankruptcy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Eberly, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, November 11, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former NBA player Jason Caffey had two kids with his wife before she filed for divorce in Fulton County last year.</p>
<p>He also has had a slew of children &mdash; at least six others &mdash; with other women around the country, in and around Atlanta as well as in Alabama, Louisiana and Illinois.</p>
<p>Most went to court and got hefty child-support orders from Caffey while he was making millions playing professional basketball. Once he left the NBA in 2003, though, Caffey&rsquo;s well of cash dried up like the shores of Lake Lanier.</p>
<p>But he was still on the hook for the payments. Now he has filed for bankruptcy in Alabama to get the women &mdash; and law enforcement &mdash; off his back.</p>
<p>Caffey&rsquo;s attorney in Atlanta says his client agreed to the high payments because he could afford it. In a 10-year career with the Chicago Bulls, Golden State Warriors and Milwaukee Bucks, the 6-foot 8-inch power forward made as much as $5 million a season.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Altman said he doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to Caffey&rsquo;s basketball money. Caffey did not return a phone message seeking comment.</p>
<p>Caffey, 34, filed for bankruptcy in August, but some of the women&rsquo;s attorneys say he hasn&rsquo;t ponied up in years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to bankruptcy documents, Caffey is nearly $2 million in debt and has about $1.15 million in assets, most of which is tied up in business ventures.</p>
<p>Among his other assets: two NBA championship rings he won with the Chicago Bulls ($10,000) and a 2006 Dodge Charger ($34,000).</p>
<p>Now living in Mobile, Caffey is a businessman, making $11,500 a month from a string of day-care centers and a sports bar, all in his hometown.</p>
<p>But he spends more than he earns &mdash; about $15,000 a month &mdash; forcing him to arrange a $50,000 loan from his mother, documents show.</p>
<p>Altman said he doesn&rsquo;t know if Caffey is currently paying child support to any of the mothers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s a deadbeat,&#8221; said another attorney, Clarence Roby Jr., who is representing a Louisiana woman who had two of Caffey&rsquo;s children. &#8220;If you choose to procreate and have children coast to coast and you don&rsquo;t take care of those children, you&rsquo;re a deadbeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear exactly how many children Caffey has fathered &mdash; and his lawyer&rsquo;s not telling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s more than I have and fewer than what Evander Holyfield has,&#8221; said Altman, who has two children, compared to 11 for Holyfield.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The women listed as creditors in the bankruptcy documents had eight of his children &mdash; five boys and three girls between the ages of 3 and 14.</p>
<p>Two of those children were born to Caffey and his wife. They were married in August 1998 and separated in January 2006, but have not yet finalized the divorce. A settlement included $2,500-a-month child support payments, but Caffey never signed it and has not been paying her, Edwards said.</p>
<p>Locally, Caffey had children with at least two women: LoRunda Brown of Lawrenceville and Nicole Carter of Atlanta, according to court records.</p>
