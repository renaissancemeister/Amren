<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Despite its staggering racial diversity &mdash; seven in 10 teens are not white &mdash; half the high school students in Canada&rsquo;s largest board say they aren&rsquo;t taught about different cultures in class, new research shows.</p>
<p>Yet two-thirds of kids say learning about their own race would make school more interesting, and almost half believe it would help them do better in school, according to a groundbreaking survey released yesterday by the Toronto District School Board.</p>
<p>In the most ambitious demographic snapshot conducted by a school board in Ontario, Toronto asked every student from Grade 7 through 12 at 289 schools highly personal &mdash; but confidential &mdash; questions about their race, sexuality, home life and disabilities on a written questionnaire done in class in 2006, as well their feelings about teachers, school, safety and how welcome they feel in class, in a bid to improve schools.</p>
<p>And while the majority of the 105,000 students said they feel safe and accepted in the halls of their schools, officials are troubled so many admit they don&rsquo;t see themselves reflected in the curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s something we feel very strongly about. When we read that, we were quite concerned,&#8221; said director of education Gerry Connelly, pledging the board will launch &#8220;an aggressive staff development initiative&#8221; to help teachers bring a range of cultural perspectives into class.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s something that helps students feel, and be, valued in their school,&#8221; she said yesterday.</p>
<p>The numbers come as the board grapples with whether to open an alternative African-centred school for students who may feel overlooked in mainstream schools. Roughly 12 per cent of students identify themselves as black.</p>
<p>The survey was designed to help figure out which demographic factors pose roadblocks to learning &mdash; from race to gender, mother tongue to family income &mdash; so the board knows where to steer help.</p>
<p>Trustee Josh Matlow voted against conducting the survey, saying the board should be taking action, not collecting data. He called the results &#8220;interesting reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe students are going to give us the full goods,&#8221; he said, especially on questions of sexuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;The survey was quite a hot topic when we did it in class,&#8221; said Grade 12 student Gerald Mak of Earl Haig Secondary School.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them wondered why their student number had to be left on if it was really confidential &mdash; but I understand why,&#8221; said the student trustee. &#8220;It was so we know where to make improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mak is one of the 71 per cent of high school students whose parents were both born outside Canada &mdash; his are from Hong Kong &mdash; and among the 20 per cent of students of East Asian descent.</p>
<p>Yet he has been taught little about Asia, he said, except a little in Grade 10 geography. &#8220;We&rsquo;re Toronto, we&rsquo;re very multicultural. I strongly agree that we should learn more about different races.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite concerns about school safety after the fatal high school shooting of Jordan Manners last spring, 81 per cent of students say they get along with others at school.</p>
<p>Of particular concern to the board&rsquo;s equity chief, Lloyd McKell, are the gaps between home and school revealed by the survey: the fact just 56 per cent of grades 7 and 8 students report eating breakfast every day, or that 35 per cent say frequent distractions at home prevent them from doing homework.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of these are issues we need to probe deeply,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It suggests to us that there are relationships with the community we need to continue to build.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next week, the board will hold its first student forum, bringing in high school youth to talk to staff about issues affecting their lives.</p>
<p>In its meeting tonight, the board is expected to create a &#8220;student data advisory committee&#8221; of staff, experts and trustees to look at ways to use the survey results to help improve student achievement.</p>
<p>A similar survey will be given next spring to children from kindergarten to Grade 6, to be filled in at home with parents.</p>
<p>Connelly said the board will focus its efforts on students in grades 6, 7 and 8 because they tend to become disengaged before high school.</p>
<p>While it will be months before the board drills down far enough into the data to know which particular students face which barriers, Connelly said the board is &#8220;committed to raising the bar and closing the achievement gap. We have a lot of vulnerable students we need to work with.&#8221;</p>
