<h1>Hairdresser Sued in Row About Headscarf</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Bentham and Anna Davis, This Is London, November 8, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The owner of an &#8220;alternative&#8221; London hair salon is being sued for religious discrimination after refusing to give a job to a Muslim woman who wanted to wear a headscarf at work.</p>
<p>Sarah Desrosiers, whose Wedge salon specialises in &#8220;urban funky&#8221; cuts, says she turned down applicant Bushra Noah because she was &#8220;selling image&#8221; and needed her staff to display their hairstyles to the public.</p>
<p>Ms Noah, 19, is claiming religious discrimination and suing Ms Desrosiers for more than £15,000 for injury to her feelings, as well as an unspecified sum for lost earnings.</p>
<p>Ms Desrosiers, 32, who set up her business in King&rsquo;s Cross 18 months ago, has already spent more than £1,000 fighting the case and says that if she loses she will be forced to close.</p>
<p>She denies any discrimination and says she rejected Ms Noah because she was unwilling to show her hair at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sell image &mdash; it&rsquo;s very important &mdash; and I would expect a hair stylist to display her hair because I need people to be drawn in off the street,&#8221; said Ms Desrosiers. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the nature and style of my salon that brings people in and someone having their hair covered conflicts with that. If someone came in wearing a baseball hat or a cowboy hat I&rsquo;d tell them to take it off while they&rsquo;re working. To me, it&rsquo;s absolutely basic that people should be able to see the stylist&rsquo;s hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a legal letter setting out her employment tribunal case, Ms Noah, from Acton, claims she was discriminated against and treated rudely at her interview in March and wrongly turned down for a job she was capable of doing because of her headscarf.</p>
<p>Ms Noah said today she had attended a total of 25 interviews for hairdressing jobs without success and had decided to take legal action because she had been upset by Ms Desrosiers&rsquo; comments. She said: &#8220;I decided to sue this hairdresser because she upset me the most. I felt so down and got so depressed, I thought if I am not going to defend myself, who is?</p>
<p>&#8220;When I spoke to her on the phone she offered me a trial day. But when I turned up she looked at me in shock. She asked if I wore the headscarf all the time. She kept repeating, &lsquo;I wish you told me over the phone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since I was in high school hairdressing is what I wanted to do. It is sad for them to not give me the opportunity. This has ruined my ambitions. Wearing a headscarf is essential to my beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Desrosiers said she was struggling to find money to contest the hearing, scheduled for January. She said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m being dragged through the mud and pretty much accused of being a racist. I feel it is totally unfair and wrong.&#8221;</p>
