						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that just a few years ago, issues of black vs. white dominated the national discourse. The Rodney King riots and the O.J. Simpson case inspired endless discussions and reams of editorial soul-searching. Affirmative action and racial preferences, multiculturalism, and political correctness were fraught topics. Then the twin towers fell, and suddenly we had a completely new enemy to worry about.</p>
<p>During the Katrina debacle, images of thousands of impoverished blacks jammed into the New Orleans Superdome brought the scandalous reality of black poverty back into view. But the moment passed. Today&rsquo;s most charged racial issue, immigration, doesn&rsquo;t involve blacks at all, but Latinos. The painful legacy of slavery &mdash; which, along with our de facto genocidal campaign against its native inhabitants, is America&rsquo;s primordial racial trauma &mdash; is no longer at the center of the national consciousness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the sidelining of race has also been calamitous. Regardless of the progress made in racial attitudes, the existence of the black underclass is an ongoing scandal. More than 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education ended de jure racial segregation in this country, poor urban blacks continue to be a group apart, plagued by disproportionately high rates of crime, incarceration, drug use, and poor health. Inner-city black children go to bad schools, live in substandard housing, eat bad food, are disproportionately raised by single mothers, and are exposed to a pathological street culture in which aggressive demands for &#8220;respect,&#8221; ugly misogyny and the crudest markers of male machismo are valorized, while education, self-discipline and personal responsibility are dismissed as &#8220;acting white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But this split reality contains within it the possibility of a breakthrough. After spending billions of dollars to try to stabilize neighborhoods in Baghdad, perhaps now Americans will be prepared to invest in the war zones in their own country. This may sound like pie in the sky, but there&rsquo;s reason for hope. Something amorphous but potentially transformative is happening &mdash; and, critically, it&rsquo;s happening within the black community itself. According to a recent NPR/Pew poll, 37 percent of blacks agreed with the statement that blacks today are so diverse they can no longer be considered a single race. Among the youngest respondents, aged 18 to 29, a staggering 44 percent agreed.</p>
<p>This is extraordinary. More than a third of the blacks who responded, and almost half of the young blacks, have rejected the cornerstone of American racial politics: black racial solidarity. If the poll is accurate, the most emotionally charged and immutable racial truth, the one-drop rule, is no longer sacrosanct for a large number of black people.</p>
<p>Almost as noteworthy is that middle-class black Americans have joined most other Americans in dissociating themselves from the values (and, by implication, the behavior) associated with the black underclass. The Pew poll found that there was a growing &#8220;values gap&#8221; between middle-class and poor blacks: 61 percent of the black respondents, and 70 percent of the college-educated blacks, said that over the past 10 years, the values of middle-class and poor blacks have become more different. Just 44 percent said that in 1986. Further confirmation of this values gap is the study&rsquo;s finding that 64 percent of blacks regard hip-hop and rap music as having a bad influence on society. Moreover, the study found that while most blacks believe that they are subject to widespread discrimination, most of them don&rsquo;t blame discrimination for the lack of black progress: 53 percent say blacks who can&rsquo;t get ahead are mostly responsible for their own condition.</p>
<p>These findings are evidence of a coming sea change in America&rsquo;s racial landscape. Together with the explosion of the Latino population, whose racial/ethnic categorization is very much in flux, and the increasing number of people of mixed-race ancestry who refuse to place themselves in traditional racial categories, the crumbling of black racial solidarity shows that race itself is beginning to fade away. And if America can seize the moment and address class inequities, which disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos and which help maintain rigid concepts of racial identity, this country&rsquo;s universalist, cosmopolitan dream could become a reality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But another reason for the erosion of black racial solidarity could be the increasing numbers of mixed-race people like Obama and Tiger Woods. Such people, as David Hollinger noted in his superb book &#8220;Postethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism,&#8221; undermine the very idea of rigid racial categories and the identity politics based on them. {snip}</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons for the finding, some black commentators have seen it as a dire development &mdash; and blamed rich blacks who have lost touch with their racial roots. Molefi {snip}&#8221; Mister Mann Frisby, a former Daily News reporter, told the paper he found the widespread black rejection of racial solidarity &#8220;scary.&#8221; &#8220;When I see studies like this, it makes me cringe because I never want to separate people,&#8221; Frisby said.</p>
<p>In an interview on NPR, Melissa Harris Lacewell, a professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton, said she found middle-class blacks&rsquo; assertion of a values gap &#8220;shocking.&#8221; Lacewell blamed figures like Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby, who are famous for championing an ethos of personal responsibility, for convincing middle-class blacks that the culprit is poor blacks themselves, not &#8220;structural racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these alarmed reactions miss the point. Asante&rsquo;s claim that the values gap is a reaction to wealthy black people &#8220;who live in a whole different world from the rest of us&#8221; seems implausible. There are comparatively few blacks who are that wealthy: Even assuming that they are famous, would their mere existence really lead large percentages of blacks to reject the idea that blacks are a single race? As for Lacewell, she assumes that calling for personal responsibility and acknowledging structural problems in society are mutually exclusive. It&rsquo;s true that a majority of blacks said individuals were mostly responsible for their failure to get ahead, not discrimination. But discrimination is not the same as structural &#8220;racism&#8221; (itself a highly questionable term). {snip}</p>
<p>The real point of the values answer is not that middle-class blacks are turning against &#8220;blackness,&#8221; whatever that is: It&rsquo;s that they are insisting that they have the right to create their own signifiers of blackness. And it&rsquo;s that middle-class blacks &mdash; who suffer from white discrimination that is in part a response to black underclass behavior, and who are far more likely to be the victims of black criminals than whites are &mdash; are no longer willing to simply give every knucklehead in the &lsquo;hood a free pass because of &#8220;structural racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also good because anything that short-circuits traditional racial clichés is helpful. Moving beyond the old formal, guilt-innocence standoff will improve relations between middle-class whites and blacks. Even more important, it will increase white willingness to tackle the huge commitment necessary to solve the problem of the black underclass. Traditional black commentators who decry the poll&rsquo;s findings are clinging, doubtless in good faith, to an old paradigm that doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. The way out of the black-white mess is a shared ethos, not a separate one. If whites feel more connected to middle-class blacks, they will ultimately feel more connected to poor ones.</p>
<p>There are major hurdles to be overcome. The Pew poll found that while large majorities of blacks believe that they are routinely victims of discrimination; most whites believe that blacks are not. This is a fundamental gap that must be overcome.</p>

<p>Frisby never wants to &#8220;separate people&#8221;?  Isn&rsquo;t that the very basis of black racial solidarity?  For years blacks have been saying that all they want is to be a part of the American dream; now that many blacks are starting to realize this dream, &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leaders are telling blacks to reject this idea and maintain racial solidarity.  To me, this just proves what I have always said: the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement was not about equality, it was about black power.<br>

					<p>&#8220;Almost as noteworthy is that middle-class black Americans have joined most other Americans in dissociating themselves from the values (and, by implication, the behavior) associated with the black underclass&#8221; Does anyone really believe it to the extent that this author is trying to imply? If anything, it might seem that middle class Blacks are distant from lower class Blacks because lower-class Blacks have had worse behavior in the past fifty years than in the previous fifty years to that. And since Whites are imitating middle-class Blacks and lower-class Blacks, every group has been dragged down to a much worse level. Besides, if middle-class Blacks were like middle-class Whites and middle-class Asians as much as this author would like us to believe, than Whites and Asians wouldn&rsquo;t be leaving their areas by the hundreds of thousands to pay more in areas that look like them.</p>

<p>Pick up your own trash. Absolutely no one else is capable of repudiating all of their problems - and with such assurity and childishness - like these people.</p>
<p>&#8220;If whites feel more connected to middle-class blacks, they will ultimately feel more connected to poor ones.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">WHY </span>would whites want to connect to <span class="caps">ANY </span>blacks <span class="caps">PERIOD</span>?

					<p>&ldquo;And if America can seize the moment and address class inequities, which disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos and which help maintain rigid concepts of racial identity, this country&rsquo;s universalist, cosmopolitan dream could become a reality&rdquo;</p>
<p>And of course this nonsense,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traditional black commentators who decry the poll&rsquo;s findings are clinging, doubtless in good faith, to an old paradigm that doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. The way out of the black-white mess is a shared ethos, not a separate one. If whites feel more connected to middle-class blacks, they will ultimately feel more connected to poor ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for this shift in black &ldquo;racial solidarity,&rdquo; that could poke holes in Comrade Kamiya&rsquo;s sunny daydream that whites will (or should )be moved by it, to &ldquo;invest&rdquo; in &ldquo;the huge commitment necessary to solve the problem of the black underclass.&rdquo; Moreover, while miscegenation may be in part driving this phenomenon, Comrade Kamiya fails to explore (willfully) just what impact this &ldquo;fashionable trend&rdquo; might have on white attitudes, when taken in tandem with their escalating shift from majority to plurality status demographically. His dangerous assumption being that a vast majority of whites not only accept this, but see it as a desirable outcome for achieving the &ldquo;universalist cosmopolitan dream&rdquo; state, that is the elitist fantasy of their so-called socioeconomic/political leaders.</p>
<p>First, it must be noted that while blacks are historically more &ldquo;unified&rdquo; than whites on some levels, there have always been pigmentation and class splits among them. Blacks who are darker have always tended to resent the lighter of their own numbers; and blacks who achieve economic success, have always tended to feel that the &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; members of their race that they are leaving behind, are of no personal consequence or interest to them. From their point of view &lsquo;I gots mine, you gets yours;&rsquo; or &lsquo;it be up to the government to help them poor suckers,&rsquo; is a largely accepted fact of life. </p>
<p>One strong speculation that could be made regarding the new focus on the &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; ethos of middleclass blacks today, is that it is simply an outgrowth of their angst, in regard to a constricting socioeconomic climate in which they sense their white opposite numbers, are getting a bit restless themselves. A sort of loose &ldquo;class empathy&rdquo; that is selfishly developing in middleclass blacks, that comes from observing that whites in the suburbs simply don&rsquo;t have the ability to spin hay into gold, or grow magic beans in their summer vegetable gardens. With this &ldquo;epiphany&rdquo; may also come the nagging idea (at some level) that if white society (which they are feeding off of) does collapse, they are going down the tubes with it?</p>
<p>Second, it is easy to segue into speculating about shifts (or already hardening) white attitudes about nonwhite social problems/pathologies  and their collective &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; in solving them. While not moving as a monolithic racial group on most issues, whites in the United States have been experiencing a ebbing and flowing reactionary disdain for the Marxist oriented utopian countercultural/multicutural politics aimed at them, for the last 40 years. </p>
<p>Since 1968, when the counterculture of the hippies was at its most frenzied and terrorist pitch, American whites have favored Republicans in the executive branch of government. When they vote for them, are they hoping for an expansion of immigration, integration, or affirmative action, or the reverse? </p>
<p>I would hold that they have been hoping for the reverse; however, time and again they have been failed because of the inherent weakness, greed, and corruption of the leadership as is such in the <span class="caps">GOP.</span> This is most demonstrably demonstrated with the current fool in the White House and the Republican Congressional leadership (1994-2006) that have/had completely refused to propagate and enforce the simplest of white interests, such as a repeal of the 1965 immigration &ldquo;reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This has been the repeated mistake that the Republicans have made, when attempting to become the near &ldquo;one party&rdquo; majority elite in this country. With an almost incomprehensible lack of survival and consolidation instincts, they have squandered victory, after victory (1994 being the zenith among these) to become as much like their &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; party as they could and continue to do so. </p>
<p>The Stupid Party, indeed!</p>
<p>Third and last, one can speculate that the continued onslaught of &ldquo;entitlements&rdquo; and &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; that whites are expected to carry as a &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; group to better the &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo; nonwhites that they are ironically seen as &ldquo;oppressing,&rdquo; will begin to become so unbearable, that traditional political undulations will cease to function as a safety valve. The more our numbers are shrunk through miscegenation, diversity norms, and immigration, the more galvanized we will likely become. It will be at that point, when we hit somewhere between 58% to 48% of the population, that this country will implode. It can&rsquo;t go on forever and it won&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>Why do men become angry and vengeful?</p>
<p>When they are desperate and oppressed beyond all sanity and respite, that is when!<br>
</p>

					<p>Article:  &#8220;Even more important, it will increase white willingness to tackle the huge commitment necessary to solve the problem of the black underclass.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">WHAT</span>?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried that for decades.  We&rsquo;ve tried reaching out with helping hands and have been left with nothing but bloody stubs.  To many, our kindness has been portrayed as weakness, and has fostered an &#8220;in your face&#8221; racial arrogance and contempt from the black community.  Social programs, spending, minority set-asides, etc.  The list goes on and on, yet black attitude has gotten worse as things were suppose to get better due to our attempts at correcting past wrongs.<br>
We have gone overboard trying to tackle the problems of the black underclass, and as a result have been reintroduced to one of lifes eternal truths:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can lead a horse to water&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I, for one, am tired of leading that horse to water.  The damn thing ain&rsquo;t drinkin&rsquo;! </p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;along with our de facto genocidal campaign against its native inhabitants&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just for the record, this often repeated line is a <span class="caps">COMPLETE MYTH</span>: There was NO &#8220;genocide&#8221; against Indians in this country. The number of Indians who were killed by whites in armed conflicts was on par with the number of whites killed by Indians. Far more Indians were killed by other Indians, both before and after the arrival of white migrants. There was NO policy of &#8220;genocide&#8221; by anyone. Many Indians died from disease, but this was NO <span class="caps">ONE&rsquo;S </span>fault. No one understood the nature of disease at that time. Europe&rsquo;s own population had been decimated by such plagues throughout its history.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Even more important, it will increase white willingness to tackle the huge commitment necessary to solve the problem of the black underclass.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There you have it.  Another plea for even more money to be thrown down the &#8220;black hole&#8221;.  As a White middle class man, I don&rsquo;t feel I have anything in common with the black middle class.  You see, I have this perception that they just didn&rsquo;t work as hard as I or anyone else did to get where they are in life.  <br>
Occasionally in my job I&rsquo;m tasked to give <span class="caps">VIP </span>tours of our facilities for potential customers.  It varies, but mostly it&rsquo;s groups of Whites from different companies.  Sometimes there&rsquo;s a black token in the group.  Usually when companies spend money to send these people, they expect them to ask questions and take notes.  The blacks do neither.  They&rsquo;re oddly quiet and hardly say a word.  They just shuffle behind the rest of the group and try to keep out of sight.  I wonder if it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on or they&rsquo;re afraid of opening their mouths and making a fool of themselves.  These people are supposed to be professionals.  <br><br>
I digress though.  Let the middle and upper class blacks take care of their own.</p>

					<p>One thing that all animals, including humans, share is this: an awareness of the pecking order, or hierarchy.  </p>
<p>People from the four corners of the globe know that attaching yourself to the whites and adopting their ways is the surest means to advance up the ladder. </p>
<p>You can see it in the Asian women who go after meek white males, you can see it in the blacks who want to live next to white neighbors, you can see it in the Arabs like Fayed who wanted to acquire English citizenship (and marry his son Dodi into the English gentry), and other examples too numerous to mention. </p>

					<p>Although highly distorted, the article points out something important.  Rich, white liberals are starting to lose interest in promoting the myth of white &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s why you see smiling Al Sharpton making so much noise about absurdities like Jena.  What blacks think about such things really doesn&rsquo;t matter.  For the most part, they are powerless because they simply do not have the qualities or abilities that bring a people real power.  Instead, they rely on deluded whites to give them power.  And that part of the western world (maybe its just the US) has shifted its self destructive impulses towards supporting terrorism.  Worse, in doing so, it&rsquo;s revealing itself as completely balls to the wall insane.  If rich white liberals have lost interest in lobbying for handouts and have revealed themselves as the sinister psychopaths that they are (so, more moderate whites won&rsquo;t have anything to do with the cause), then blacks are in a real pickle.  What are they going to do?  Start voting republican?</p>

					<p>I think the poster at &#8220;6:07&#8221; is onto something. Are Blacks moving up or Whites moving down? With the saturation of American &#8220;culture&#8221; with all things black, ghetto, hip-hop, urban and what have you, it seems all of society is moving backward! Economics aside, the coarsening and ghetto-ization of American culture creates an illusion of cohesion that is more a creation of <span class="caps">TV, </span>movies, music industry, etc. than reality. </p>
<p>No doubt there is some truth to the article. Few can deny that middle-class blacks are a larger, more functionally integrated lot. But they are also still the exception and even at that, are still essentially stuck at that level, with little hope of moving on. Unless they are hip-hop &#8220;moguls&#8221; or sports &#8220;stars&#8221; how many blacks have or can move beyond middle-class? </p>

					<p>There are many, <span class="caps">MANY  </span>silly and/or obviously incorrect and/or deliberately misleading points in this latest temper tantrum from Komrade Kamiya, Kultural Worker at the San Francisco branch of the People&rsquo;s Edukational Kollektive (sometimes known as &#8220;Salon&#8221;). </p>
<p>Although I would richly enjoy slicing-n-dicing <span class="caps">ALL </span>of Kamiya&rsquo;s mentally-ill pronouncements one by one, I&rsquo;ll confine myself to this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the twin towers fell, and suddenly we had a completely new enemy to worry about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering Kamiya has been loud-n-proud in his hope that as many American soldiers as possible get killed in the War on Terror, the only enemy this vicious idiot has <span class="caps">EVER </span>had is White America. Understand this, and the rest of his ridiculous recommendations all fall into place. </p>
<p>Gary Kamiya&rsquo;s ultimate goal is the death of White America. He doesn&rsquo;t want to reform you. He doesn&rsquo;t want you to start being nicer to black people. He wants you <span class="caps">DEAD.</span> Yes, my fellow AmRen readers, this means <span class="caps">YOU.</span><br>

					<p>Wow!  At least with Conservatives you know where you stand when it comes to race.  I can&rsquo;t stand liberals who claim to be doing a service for &#8220;people of color&#8221; only to reveal their fangs later.</p>
<p>There is less Black solidarity than in the past because of one reason.  There are many different types of people in a race, thus you have a different perspective.  Imagine that black people can think as individuals and don&rsquo;t have to consider the impact that their individual decisions have on an entire race.</p>

					<p>&#8220;The Pew poll found that while large majorities of blacks believe that they are routinely victims of discrimination; most whites believe that blacks are not&#8221;. </p>
<p>Discrimination - the recognition of qualities and differences among certain things or persons and making choices based on those qualities.</p>
<p>Using truth is &#8220;common sense&#8221;. <br>

					<p>Surely there is a glaring fact that makes a mockery of this whole study?<br>
I think JohnPM came close to this in the above post.</p>
<p>Whose opinions were taken in the survey? If they themselves used the &#8216;one drop&rsquo; rule, then they interviewed people who were mixed race, or only partially black, as well as surveying people who look wholly black. Many mixed race people, like Tiger Woods, have indeed been considered by society as &#8216;black&rsquo;, but often themselves do not like the term, understandably not seeing why this one aspect of their background should define them. So when a pollster asks them, as a &#8216;black man&rsquo;, about their racial identity, they are likely from a personal perspective to think that blackness is &#8216;too diffuse&rsquo; a concept to define them. People who are more clearly black will still identify their race as important.<br>
The article kind of recognises this by mentioning the increasing number of mixed-race people, but makes a mockery of it&rsquo;s own conclusions by including the same mixed race-people in a poll of black attitudes! Surely the whole lesson of the poll is that these mixed race people dont consider themselves black..SO <span class="caps">WHY ARE THEY BEING INCLUDED</span> IN <span class="caps">THE POLL</span> IN <span class="caps">THE FIRST PLACE</span>!!!<br><br>
It must be the source of ultimate frustration for people like Tiger Woods..</p>
<p>Tiger Woods: I dont believe the black race exists.<br>
Interviewer: and is that your opinion as a black man, Tiger?</p>
<p>In conclusion: this poll does <span class="caps">NOT </span>prove that race is no longer important. People who are really black still consider their race to be important. What the survey <span class="caps">DOES </span>prove is that there is a growing number of mixed-race people who are unwilling to align themselves with the blacks, as before. America is seeing the birth of a new, more complex caste system, with mixed-race people abandoning their black ancestory for a step up the social ladder. Who can blame them?</p>

<p>What is your point Comrade <span class="caps">HTGRM</span>?</p>
<p>Your post is so rambling, I am not even sure you know what the word miscegenation means? How sexual relations and procreation between whites and nonwhites is &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; is beyond me; it is clearly a form of genocide for whites, just as immigration is a form of demographic displacement for them, and blacks too as the primary minority in the <span class="caps">USA </span>(if the truth be told.) But how does that translate into &ldquo;discrimination?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I am amused by your post, but I am also perplexed; please clarify what you are driving at, Comrade <span class="caps">HTGRM</span>?</p>

<p><span class="caps">WHAT</span>?</p>
<p> Why must it always be the white race to come and fix the problems; only to be called racist once it is fixed?<br>
 At what point will the white race realise that you cannot stand alone against an army, that to help your fellow white ( simply because they&rsquo;re white) is Ok? How long will the white race will be forced to pay for the &#8220;sins&#8221; of slavery?<br><br>

<p>I have the same experience with black people. Many of them go into social work and work for the city or county but many don&rsquo;t have degrees but are drug counselor/counselors or clerks with certificates and maybe HS degree. Many of them can&rsquo;t read or write properly. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising to see a black person with a real degree and license to practice even though government and non-profit social work is overwhelmingly black people. These are not normal &#8220;middle class&#8221; people. Even the ones with degrees are not up to par in their work which makes me very angry that the  welfare of families and children are entrusted to people who are obviously unqualified and problematic. </p>
<p>Many of their friends and relatives are criminals and drug users. I was very naive and young when I went into social work and became friends with black co-workers and was shocked at the level of dysfunction in their lives and of their families&rsquo; lives. I had thought before than that there were average black families and poor dysfunctional blacks but now I don&rsquo;t make a distinction unless I know the people very well and that the black people in question have lot of intermixing of middle class white and Asians in their family.</p>

					<p>&#8220;To Comrade honest-to-goodness race mixer&hellip; What is your point Comrade <span class="caps">HTGRM</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that white women are willing to mate with non-white men, and non-white women are unwilling to mate with white men. If the situation were reversed, we&rsquo;d have a growing and lightening population instead of a shrinking white population and a darkening populace.</p>
<p>In some city hospitals, with a half-white population, very few of the babies are being born to a white father, this was especially true in the early 90&rsquo;s, in any case.  </p>
<p>One could argue, it is white men who are discriminating against non-white women, however have we not constantly been told, &#8216;it&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s choice&rsquo;? When it comes to mating and only simple mating, men seem less inclined to discriminate against any female. Regardless, one white man could himself father enough children to even up the numbers for those smarter than us always in search of equality, vibrancy, and &#8216;racial balance&rsquo;, if women so chose. </p>
<p>Simply put, women of all races are discriminating against white men. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done my part, and yes, have fathered a non-white child.</p>
<p>Looking at it the situation from the perspective of an individuals rights, and not the current notion in place of groups rights&hellip; whether every individual has a right to procreate, or even, a responsibilty to procreate, whether or not this is true is debateable. Perhaps this should be regulated; and the diversity managers can tell us, not just: who we can hire, where we must go to school; what we must feel, but should also tell us just who among us can have children, and with whom. </p>
<p>I must ask you, how much longer can &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, discrimination against white men, (and all the double-speak that goes with it)&hellip; how long can affirmative action be justified, as a means of providing preferences to those who are poor, when it&rsquo;s needed, because of discrimination against white men in the first place? Discrimination against white men, in order to rectify the problems caused by discrimination against white men? How long? Not long, after white men have been denied this, &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too. To speed up that day, which seems to be a popular subject on AmRen, I would suggest you begin asking for it.</p>

I&rsquo;ll quite happily call &#8216;it&rsquo; what &#8216;it&rsquo; is, but you will have to explain what &#8216;it&rsquo; is first! How do you think miscegenation has caused the underclass? Surely race-mixng with whites is to their advantage, at least from a genetic point of view? Please clarify!</p>

					<p>To Comrade honest-to-goodness race mixer, </p>
<p>Thank you for your more lucid, if also hideously mendacious response, to my second post in response to you.</p>
<p>You note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply put, women of all races are discriminating against white men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simply put, that is nonsense!</p>
<p>I am going to suggest (given your handle) that since you seem to have found some racially treasonous, vile white &ldquo;woman&rdquo; to whelp a child with, you think the whole world is going that way? Am I right?</p>
<p>Well, here comes the reality check; I am currently involved with a white woman, who does not date nonwhites and never would. Moreover, I work in a female dominated clinic and the white women there overwhelmingly choose to date and marry white men (at a rate of about 99.9%.) The Asian women there (the few of them) pretty much split 35% to 65% on that score, in favor of their own males; of the two married outside of race, it is not to black males, but white men. Ironically (deeply so, if you knew my views of the &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; of Asian women,) one of them is irritatingly expressing her interest in, guess who.</p>
<p>Good luck, honey-san!</p>
<p>There is my personal current experiences, in the world of observed and actual romantic realities. But this rebuttal of your intended disheartening aria, will not halt there, since that would be simply reducing my refuting of it, to your standards.</p>
<p>Thus, here are the general trends in interracial marriage for the <span class="caps">USA</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that landmark Loving v. Virginia ruling, the number of interracial marriages has soared; for example, black-white marriages increased from 65,000 in 1970 to 422,000 in 2005, according to Census Bureau figures. Factoring in all racial combinations, Stanford University sociologist Michael Rosenfeld calculates that more than 7 percent of America&rsquo;s 59 million married couples in 2005 were interracial, compared to less than 2 percent in 1970.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See this AR link:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2007/04/interracial_mar.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2007/04/interracial_mar.php</a></p>
<p>Yes Comrade, from 1970 to 2005 (a 35 year gap) the country had grown from approximately 203 million people (majority white by about 87%) to a country of approximately 297 million people (67% majority white.) </p>
<p>See this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cairco.org/data/data_us.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cairco.org/data/data_us.html</a></p>
<p>Thus, the demographic decline of whites in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>has very little to do with interracial marriage, since in 2005 only 4.13 million (in all combinations, not just white and nonwhite) were matched against 54.87 million that were intraracial. </p>
<p>For whites in the <span class="caps">USA, </span>interracial marriage is a minor problem when compared to all the present horrors of &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; Marxist political incursions and the subsequent future ongoing nightmares they portend, that allow for the current unrestrained Third World &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; invasion and unchecked predatory nonwhite violence in this country!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time and &ldquo;insights,&rdquo; Comrade honest-to-goodness race mixer,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

					<p>Seeing a white woman with a black man turns my stomach. I find it disgusting. I would never date a woman that had been out with a black man, and I imagine many others on this site would feel the same way. White men who go out with black women however- this just strikes me as weird. </p>
<p><span class="caps">HTGRM </span>says black women must be discriminating against white men, otherwise there would be more going out together- &#8220;When it comes to mating and only simple mating, men seem less inclined to discriminate against any female.&#8221;</p>
<p>I dont agree. Even as a child, before I was racially aware, I cannot remember fancying a black woman, in fact I barely regarded them as being sexual beings at all. No more female than, say, a female plant. They just do nothing for me. I&rsquo;m not sure I could raise a smile for them, let alone anything else. I have noticed my friends and work colleagues never name black women when they are talking about their ideal woman, or even ones they just like, so I dont think I&rsquo;m alone.</p>

					<p>It seems to me that, given the legal precedents of truth in advertising and product labeling laws, it ought to be possible to require all Whites who have had voluntary sex with Blacks to be properly labeled.  Perhaps a tatooed warning on the forehead, so that healthy people can keep their distance from the tainted ones.</p>

					<p><i>non-white women are unwilling to mate with white men.</i></p>
<p>Not true. Around these parts, Hispanic women are on the prowl for white men. And who can blame them, given the average Latino male&rsquo;s attitude towards women? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the same thing about Asian women chasing white men, but have never witnessed it personally, probably because I&rsquo;m a working-class person and most Asians are professionals and I simply don&rsquo;t move in those circles.</p>
