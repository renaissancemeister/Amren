						<p>Cook County Board President Todd Stroger can&rsquo;t get his budget passed &#8220;because he&rsquo;s black,&#8221; his floor leader angrily charged Tuesday.</p>
<p>Commissioner William Beavers said &#8220;if Todd was a white man, he wouldn&rsquo;t have half these problems,&#8221; further alleging &#8220;this is a remake of the Harold Washington days&#8221; at City Hall, where racially fueled votes often ended in 29-21 decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&rsquo;s gonna control the county &mdash; white or black &mdash; that&rsquo;s all this is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Beavers railed on that one of Stroger&rsquo;s top critics, Commissioner Tony Peraica, &#8220;hates everybody who&rsquo;s black .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all black elected officials,&#8221; going on to say Peraica used to beat up black people growing up in the Bridgeport neighborhood.</p>
<p>Peraica and others say the comments are not only untrue, they&rsquo;re born of a desperate frustration that Stroger can&rsquo;t pass a 2 percentage-point sales tax hike or other increases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet, prompted by a reporter&rsquo;s question, Beavers yelled not to forget that he&rsquo;s &#8220;the hog with the big nuts and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More jabs at Peraica</b></p>
<p>Name-calling continued as Commissioner Liz Gorman, county Republican Party chairman, ripped into fellow Republican Peraica unprovoked, reading from a list of insults, calling him a &#8220;loser,&#8221; &#8220;pathetic, pathological liar,&#8221; an &#8220;abusive weasel&#8221; who is &#8220;no man,&#8221; and an &#8220;ineffective leader&#8221; who has &#8220;no substance.&#8221;</p>
<p>A shocked Peraica said Gorman has &#8220;no self-respect&#8221; and her attack was &#8220;abominable&#8221; and &#8220;despicable.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then, even Commissioner Joseph Mario Moreno called Peraica &#8220;a jerk.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Interesting situation here. Once again, we&rsquo;ve got another White woman lining up on the side of blacks against a White man.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s something in the water that White women are drinking<br>
that makes them go agaist their race at every opportunity.</p>

					<p>&#8220;`Who&rsquo;s gonna control the county &mdash; white or black &mdash; that&rsquo;s all this is,&rsquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a fool. He&rsquo;s about twenty years behind the times. Neither one has been in charge for a long time. And now with the Mexican invasion, where ever the Mestizos settle in large numbers, that fact will become obvious to all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the Blacks didn&rsquo;t see that one coming. Sigh. I guess we didn&rsquo;t either. </p>

					<p>Darn, little Todd Stroger is dumb. It has taken him so long to play the race card.  If Little Todd is right, than the solution is not to have black politicians and vote for only white guys. I think that is is what todd meant. The fact that Todd wants to raise taxes to a high level after placing many imcompetent family members in has nothing to do with the opposition. If Blacks want to control the county, they should worry about what a certain family name Daley feels about that. Then again the Daleys have white skin and black souls. Lastly, Beavers is the &#8220;hog with the big nuts.&#8221;  Thats priceless, you just can&rsquo;t make this up!                                     </p>

					<p>If a black is ever accused of a crime, whether baseless or well-founded, there are screams of racism.<br>
But blacks instinctively and habitually make baseless accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; against whites. Now if anything is &#8220;racist&#8221; THIS is.</p>

					<p>Remember, if they cooperate with Todd, we can actually cause the collapse of government in Crook County; maybe even drive anti-gun Mayor Daley (The Great Dictator that destroyed our lakefront airport, Meigs Field in the middle of the night) from office!</p>
<p>Vote for Blacks at all levels of government in Crook County and Chicago; their natural level of corruption will <span class="caps">RISE </span>to the occasion with their fingers in all tills!</p>

					<p>Tom, Liz Gorman is a Republican in name only. She ran as a <span class="caps">GOP </span>candidate for the sole reason that the district that she represents has a <span class="caps">GOP </span>majority. All of his relatives are from Democratic backgrounds, including quite a few who are politically active on behalf of Democrats. Moreover, Gorman hates Tony Peraica and never misses a chance to insult him. Gorman&rsquo;s husband is a car dealer who sells to a largely black clientele. The dealership has been sued repeatedly for submitting bad credit applications for car loans. </p>

					<p>I live in the state that gave birth to Reagan, saw Lincoln become a man, and has been graced by Grant, Sandburg, and Altgeld.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got a governor (Blagojevich) who can&rsquo;t control the state legislature, two moron senators in Dick &#8220;Turban&#8221; Durbin and Barry Obama, farcical &#8220;Crook&#8221; County board chairman Stroger who was elected when his father was in a deep coma, and Jesse Jackson on the loose.</p>
<p>Somewhere is a state where my hard-earned dollars could be responsibly spent by conservative honest government.  I can hope&hellip;.</p>

					<p>If Todd possessed an ounce of intelligence, he would not have any problems. His nickname is &#8220;Urkel&#8221; and he may be the stupidest politician ever to be foisted upon the people of Chicago and Cook County. His performance has been so bad that it is difficult to imagine him operating in any American city outside of Detroit or New Orleans.</p>
<p>William Beavers was placed on the County Board to act as Todd&rsquo;s babysitter. The real screaming is going to begin if the rumors are correct: fearing the loss of County Board Presidency, the Democratic Party may not slate Todd Stroger for reelection. </p>

<p>How is it possible to have a civlization in which members of government speak like this? Is this man channeling Cicero, Edmund Burke, or Dr. Dre? It is sheer madness that a person such as this could be in any position of authority. He belongs in the African Bush, not participating in a civilized society.<br>

					<p>Todd&rsquo;s daddy, John Stroger, had no problems getting his budget passed and he is black. Cook county has the highest sales tax in the nation and Todd wants to raise it. Could that be the problem, not race?  </p>

					<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gonna control the county &mdash; white or black &mdash; that&rsquo;s all this is,&rdquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he means is who&rsquo;s going to have possession of the county&rsquo;s cookie jar, because if he believes that the politicians &ldquo;control&rdquo; the people in the county then he is a petty tyrant with delusions of Godhood&hellip;<br>
