<h1>Hightower Student Ticketed for Racial Posters</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rosa Flores, Texas Cable News, November 8, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A sensitive issue at Hightower High School had police giving 11 News a hard time.</p>
<p>The reporter covering the story was not allowed to talk to anyone on the public sidewalk nor the public street that faces the school.</p>
<p>The district e-mailed 11 News a picture and said that an 11th grade student posted the words &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;colored&#8221; over two water fountains.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an interesting detail, school officials say the student who posted the signs is African American.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a surprising twist and I&rsquo;m not quite sure what it could be. But we are concerned that when these symbols are used that we have people use them because of their historical significance,&#8221; said Cominsky.</p>
<p>It is a significance that has parents and students very surprised.</p>
<p>The student who posted the signs was ticketed for disorderly conduct by offensive gesture.</p>
<p>He was also suspended for three days.</p>

						<p>It&rsquo;s a high school shocker &mdash; water fountains found labeled for &#8220;whites&#8221; and &#8220;colored.&#8221; Was it an innocent prank? It&rsquo;s a sign of previous times that is stirring up emotion in Fort Bend County.</p>
<p>The handmade signs were only posted on the wall at Hightower High School for a matter of minutes, but many here feel that being posted for only a matter of seconds is far too long.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two water fountains each had a handwritten sign above. One read &#8220;whites&#8221; and the other read &#8220;colored.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody would find that offensive,&#8221; said Alice Gibson, aunt of a Hightower student. &#8220;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campus police say they caught a 16-year-old student in the act of hanging the signs. School officials sent a letter home to parents on Thursday describing what had happened. The letter also explained that the teen was cited for allegedly committing a class C misdemeanor for disorderly conduct by an offensive gesture.</p>
<p>Nearly 57% of the students at Hightower High School are African American, and so is the student who stands accused of putting the signs on the wall. Some say that doesn&rsquo;t make this act any less offensive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most everyone here agrees, though, that these signs and what they represent is no laughing matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know,&#8221; Gibson explained. &#8220;We all know that we really must be politically correct. No matter what you think, keep it to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Bend ISD officials say the student wouldn&rsquo;t tell them what his motivation was. He has been suspended from school for three days. If convicted in court, he could be forced to pay a fine of up to $500.</p>
