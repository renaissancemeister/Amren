<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Sir Ian Blair&rsquo;s force is spending £15,000 of public money creating &#8220;ethnically diverse&#8221; police mascots after one officer complained that the original white male model was alienating women and ethnic minority staff.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard approved the cost for creating a cast of four police figures including an Asian female community support officer called Sunita.</p>
<p>The decision has sparked a public row and led to some officers claiming the move is a result of &#8220;overbearing political correctness&#8221;.</p>
<p>PCSO Steve, a uniformed mascot complete with over-sized head and equipment, was created by the Metropolitan Police for visits to primary schools.</p>
<p>But one of the force&rsquo;s sergeants slammed the character for failing to represent the capital&rsquo;s communities.</p>
<p>He said the figure, which is white with blue eyes and blond hair, risked leaving Asian and women officers feeling &#8220;isolated&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sergeant cited an incident where an Asian colleague was not able to wear the short-sleeved outfit because his arms were darker skinned than the costume.</p>
<p>Now senior officers have said they will invest £15,000 in the design and production of three new characters.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions from the London Assembly, the Commissioner said staff from the force&rsquo;s diversity unit were brought in to help create the costumes.</p>
<p>Sir Ian said: &#8220;These characters will be more representative of London&rsquo;s population and the diverse range of police personnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The choice of characters will allow the concept of a Safer Neighbourhoods team to be presented to young children as well as delivering an important message about the different roles of PCSOs and constables.&#8221;</p>
<p>The original PCSO Steve costume was created in 2005 and is based on real-life Sutton borough police community support officer Stephen King.</p>
<p>Paid for by a £1,000 sponsorship deal with a local plumbing firm, the character proved a huge hit at schools and other public events.</p>
<p>Despite its success, one officer criticised the mascot &mdash; sparking a force-wide debate.</p>
<p>In a letter to police in-house magazine The Job published yesterday, one officer said the row could damage relations between the police and the public.</p>
<p>Pc Geoff Parker, who works in Islington, said: &#8220;One of the things that is damaging our job and our relations with the community is this constant overbearing political correctness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seem to be taking the issue to the extreme, and pandering to every whim and gripe. We need to take a sensible approach to this and stop over-reacting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another officer, Wahab Mohammed, wrote: &#8220;Being a dark-skinned Asian myself, I think the so-called problem is pathetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to long-sleeved shirts? This is a very good initiative but you always have to have someone criticising the most minute things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I&rsquo;m sure people could spend a bit more time trying to deal with matters that actually affect people. PCSO Steve is a good lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project has now been renamed &#8220;Police Pals&#8221; and police officer versions of the costumes will also be made.</p>
<p>The 12 new costumes &mdash; four for each character &mdash; include PCSO Steve, an Asian woman PCSO named Sunita, and a man and a woman police constable. They are expected to be ready early next year.</p>
<p>The £15,000 bill includes £600 in design costs and £14,400 for the creation of four suits for each of the three characters.</p>
<p>Sir Ian has striven to make the Met more ethnically diverse.</p>
<p>In the month he started as Commissioner in February 2005, the Oxford English graduate replaced the phrase &#8220;visible ethnic minority&#8221; with &#8220;minority group&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last year, he asked his officers to declare whether they are homosexual, a first step to setting up quotas for numbers of gay and lesbian officers.</p>
