						<p>Christmas should be downgraded in favour of festivals from other religions to improve race relations, says an explosive report.</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s favourite think-tank says that because it would be hard to &#8220;expunge&#8221; Christmas from the national calendar, &lsquo;even-handedness&rsquo; means public organisations must start giving other religions equal footing.</p>
<p>The leaked findings of its investigation into identity, citizenship and community cohesion also propose:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&#8220;Birth ceremonies&#8221;, at which state and parents agree to &#8220;work in partnership&#8221; to bring up children</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Action to &#8220;ensure access&#8221; for ethnic minorities to &#8220;largely white&#8221; countryside</p>
<p>*&nbsp;An overhaul of Britain&rsquo;s &#8220;imperial&#8221; honours system</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Bishops being thrown out of the House of Lords</p>
<p>*&nbsp;An end to &#8220;sectarian&#8221; religious education</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Flying flags other than the Union Jack.</p>
<p>The report by the Institute for Public Policy Research was commissioned when Nick Pearce, now head of public policy at Downing Street, was its director.</p>
<p>IPPR has shaped many Labour policies, including ID cards, bin taxes and road pricing.</p>
<p>The report robustly defends multiculturalism &mdash; the idea that different communities should not be forced to integrate but should be allowed to maintain their own culture and identities.</p>
<p>And it says immigrants should be required to acquire some proficiency in English and other aspects of British culture &#8220;if &mdash; but only if &mdash; the settled population is willing to open up national institutions and practices to newcomers and give a more inclusive cast to national narratives and symbols&#8221;.</p>
<p>It adds: &#8220;Even-handedness dictates that we provide public recognition to minority cultures and traditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are going to continue as a nation to mark Christmas &mdash; and it would be very hard to expunge it from our national life even if we wanted to &mdash; then public organisations should mark other religious festivals too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can no longer define ourselves as a Christian nation, nor an especially religious one in any sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;The empire is gone, church attendance is at historically low levels, and the Second World War is inexorably slipping from memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, written by IPPR advisers Ben Rogers and Rick Muir, calls on Ministers to launch an &#8220;urgent and upfront campaign&#8221; promoting a &#8220;multicultural understanding of Britishness&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism can be shown to provide for a fairer and more liberal society and does not necessarily lead to social division and community conflict, as its critics have claimed,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>Councils must act to &#8220;ensure children mix and are able to form friendships with pupils from different backgrounds&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report adds: &#8220;Any liberal state should recast the civic oaths and national ceremonies, or institutions like Parliament and the monarchy, in a more multi-religious or secular form and make religious education less sectarian.&#8221;</p>
<p>The presence of bishops in the House of Lords, for instance, is condemned as an &#8220;anachronism&#8221; that should be removed.</p>
<p>The system in which parents are required to register a new baby at a register office is dismissed as &#8220;purely bureaucratic&#8221;.</p>
<p>The occasion should be transformed into a &#8220;public rite&#8221;, using citizenship ceremonies for immigrants as a model, the report says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parents, their friends and family and the state [would] agree to work in partnership to support and bring up their child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rural Britain, the report complains, &#8220;remains a largely white place&#8221;.</p>
<p>Much more needs to be done to &#8220;ensure access&#8221; to the countryside for black and ethnic minority groups, disabled people and children from inner-city areas.</p>
<p>Sayeeda Warsi, the Conservative spokesman on community cohesion, said: &#8220;Their comments betray a breathtaking misunderstanding of what it is to be British. These proposals could actually damage cohesion.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;You don&rsquo;t build community cohesion by throwing out our history and denying the fundamental contribution Christianity has played and does play to our nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a British Muslim I can see that &mdash; so why others can&rsquo;t just staggers me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she attacked ceremonies to mark the registration of a baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thought of Gordon Brown sharing responsibility with me for bringing up my children sends a shiver down my spine. I thought we got rid of communism?&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Action to &#8216;ensure access&rsquo; for ethnic minorities to &#8216;largely white&rsquo; countryside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all the disheartening articles that I&rsquo;ve read on what&rsquo;s going on in England, this article is the most appalling.  So the English must be pursued by immigrants from one end of the country to the other, lest they be permitted any small measure of refuge among their own kind in their own country!  </p>
<p>I keep waiting for the final straw which will cause the English to rise up against their tyrannical masters and take to the streets by the hundreds of thousands in angry protest.  Is there no limit to their tolerance for traitors?      </p>

<p>I wondered when their collective racial suicide would turn into a state sponsored racial euthanasia.  Seems like this report is the official announcement.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Christmas should be downgraded in favour of festivals from other religions to improve race relations, says an explosive report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another genius that hasn&rsquo;t figured out that race relations wouldn&rsquo;t even be a problem if he had pushed for keeping a mostly homnogeneous country.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m aware that the multicults are a world-wide group afflicted with severe mental disorders, but I can&rsquo;t help thinking that a lot of the multicult process they adapted is because they wanted to be like the big country, America.</p>

<p>Not only did you not get rid of it, you voted it in and have been living under it for the last ten years, if not the last forty.  How odd to think that in the long run Russia may have actually won the Cold War, and Japan may have won World War <span class="caps">II. </span> While those two nations have the courage to maintain pride in their history, heritage and identity, the &#8220;victors&#8221; of the Cold War are all under the thumb of neo-Marxist governments implenting the same destructive policies everywhere.    </p>

					<p>Right now I&rsquo;m feeling too sick(from reading the article)to write up on this. What more can be said,? at least the Daily Mail is a popular and fairly serious tabloid style newspaper, with with a wide readership so it should get read by millions.<br>
  I&rsquo;m taking action and making sure that I send this article to as many people as possible who won&rsquo;t see the <span class="caps">D.M</span>ail.<br><br>

					<p>In Britain we have alot of &#8220;christianity-haters&#8221; (like some on Amren), however the christianity-haters in Britain are usually white liberal atheists. These white liberal atheists denounce christianity as homophobic but at the same time seem to see no problem with the huge growth of Islam in Britain. We live in a world full of strange paradoxes. </p>

Black Bishop, only non-Whites can speak up for Whites in England<br><br>
and still get a hearing. And how noble, this Think Tank! As if<br><br>
they really don&rsquo;t want to get rid of Christianity. And yes, Say-<br><br>
eeda, they would destroy your tradition if they could. But no,<br><br>
Sayeeda, communism has not been gotten rid of. Communism is the<br><br>
only reason you&rsquo;re in Britain at all.</p>

					<p>State birth ceremonies&hellip;hmmm&hellip;we did have suchlikes under the Communists in Czechoslovakia. It was held in a hall in a council house, the mothers with their babies sat in the first row, neighborhood mayor held a speech to assembled families and then every mother was called out, obtained some memorabilia trinkets and a handshake from mayor, while the baby was for the moment laid in an official cradle. They called it &#8220;welcoming of the newborns&#8221;. One got an invitation around 3rd month of the bay&rsquo;s age, but it was not compulsory. And it was definitely nothing very impressive or citizenhood-stimulating. </p>
<p>The artificially introduced ceremonies tend to be like that - just remember the total failure of French revolutionaries in establishing the new religion of Reason.</p>
<p>About Christmas - the Commies also tried to downplay those by inserting Father Frost(you know, that Russian old man clad in red and riding the sledge with reindeers&hellip;). They succeeded to the extent that Christmas lost mostly their religious appeal in favor of the consumer one, but as I understand now, this is the case everywhere. So how do the New Labourists think that the consumerist main harvest can be downplayed more? </p>

<p>Just another Muslim tactic in a cunning attempt to deflect the suspicions <span class="caps">AND </span>fears of the indigenous peoples who happen to be white and Christian, not nonwhite and Muslim.  In other words, pretend empathy and throw them off-guard.</p>
<p><i>Our History!  Our nation!</i></p>
<p>Where nonwhites are concerned both statements are pure lies.</p>
<p>Would this alien nonwhite female, for instance, raise any objections to the white British laying claim to Pakistan and Pakistani history bearing in mind the white British, just sixty years ago, ruled the place with some birthing of offspring there, too? </p>
<p>Well!<br>
 <br><br>
<i>British Muslim</i>!  </p>
<p>A total lie.  There&rsquo;s no such identity.  More correctly, her description of herself should have read - &#8216;Nonwhite Muslim living in Britain.&rsquo; </p>
<p><b>For one to be British, one must belong to white European genetic ancestry, heritage, culture, history and religious belief system/s,</b> ie, European Pagan or Christian.  </p>
<p><b>Brown-skinned Asians like her do not belong in Britain since they are not British by racial origin, ancestral lineage,  heritage, belief system, culture and tradition.</b>  The only ethnicities with entitlement to call themselves British and whose natural and exclusive heritages comprise the territory of Britain and its resources, are collectively the indigenous white British themselves. </p>
<p>Islam, along with Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism, for example, are not British and European belief systems either, Christianity being the exception to the rule, in view of the fact this belief system formed the foundation of the late Roman era British civilisation as well as the rest of Europe up until the present day. </p>
<p>Not even the Moorish conquest of parts of the Mediterranean formed the founding faith and thus civilization of that region either.  Again, Christianity did.  </p>
<p>The Moors rescued and preserved books of Greek antiquity, <b>but unsurprisingly as is highly typical of Muslims, they proceeded to lay claim to them too by virture of having, over some considerable time, improved upon the originals.</b> <br>

					<p>The pseudo-liberal elites have a vested interest in destroying any sense of nation-states as being constituted by shared language, culture, history and - most importantly if most controversially - race. It is no coincidence that so many modern politicians are lawyers, and have consequently drunk deep of the sleeping draught of fundamentalist egalitarianism, which misconceives citizenship as a purely legal relationship which - in the name of &#8220;equality&#8221; - is universal and unlimited in scope; certainly unlimited by ethnic, linguistic and cultural identity. and therefore infinitely transferable.</p>
<p>We fool ourselves, however, if we believe that these pseudo-liberal elites are in any way open to rational persuasion. I will give you an example. The books that are reviewed on Amazon are generally given favourable reviews by their intended readership, with only a few dissentients, if any. This means that a book written from a &#8220;liberal&#8221; perspective will be favourably reviewed by so-called liberals, and the dissenting reviews of conservatives will be rated accordingly (e.g. &#8220;1 out of 25 readers found this review helpful&#8221;). </p>
<p>The opposite is also true, but to a more limited extent; the PC left are far more vigilant and aggressive than the few beleaguered conservatives and PC-sceptics. I recently read one of the few hostile reviews on Amazon of a thoroughly bad book, &#8220;The Progressive Patriot&#8221;, by Billy Bragg, a vaguely leftish folk/punk singer strangely lionised by the PC establishment in the UK (and very close to New Labour). The reviewer, one Neil Saunders, wrote a remarkably articulate and closely-argued critique of the nation-denying PC mentality manifested in Bragg&rsquo;s lamentable book (a sort of appeal for that oxymoron - &#8220;civic [i.e. racially and culturally neutral] nationalism&#8221;). Needless to say, his (extremely persuasive and well-written) review was dismissed as a &#8220;rant&#8221; by one of the other reviewers, and rated extremely low by the readers. The PC pseudo-liberals do not deign to argue with their enemies, but merely vilify them.</p>

How &#8216;bout we all just convert to Islam now. Why delay the inevitable? That seems to be the goal. One nation under Allah (praise be upon Him), no differences, no clash of cultures and religions. Once our differences are eliminated, there will be no conflicts and Islam truly will be the religion of peace.</p>
<p>Some homogeneity is more equal than others.<br>

					<p>I would be in favor of going back to the Feast of Saturnalia instead of Christmas, which &#8220;Christmas&#8221; originally was.  The early Christians should have come up with their own holidays, rather than merely renaming pagan European holidays.  On the other hand, since Christmas offends fourth-world invaders, I&rsquo;m in favor of it, which leaves me in something of a quandry.</p>
<p>Nonwhites have plenty of their own holidays: Kwanzaa, Ramadan, etc.  Perhaps we whites should come up with some new holidays of our own.  I would like to spend the next Noosemas decorating the hanging tree with ornaments crafted of the finest six-strand hemp, exchanging gifts and then eating a nice dinner with my wife.  Schoolchildren could be forced into appropriate clothing and role-playing exercises on Rourke&rsquo;s Drift Day each January 22: biscuit boxes, mealie bags, bayonets, Henry-Martini rifles and .45&#8221; cartridges could be provided for the white children, and spears for the black ones.  An annual celebration of the Apollo-11 landing could be held every July 16.  Backyard barbecues and fireworks might be appropriate.<br>

					<p>The agenda we see at work in this story is about creating a borderless world w/ one central gov&rsquo;t (probably the UN) which is based on Socialism/Marxism.  The leftist elite masters figure people had better start to get along and, thus, forcing people to live together and encouraging &#8220;tolerance&#8221; is the way to do it.  I call these elites the &#8220;hippie globalists&#8221;.</p>
<p>But perhaps the &#8220;hippie globalists&#8221; are merely pawns or useful idiots to the real elite masters, ie. the economic globalists (the Rockefellers, central bankers, etc).

					<p>&#8220;Sayeeda Warsi, the Conservative spokesman on community cohesion, said: &ldquo;Their comments betray a breathtaking misunderstanding of what it is to be British. These proposals could actually damage cohesion.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>You know a Labour Party report is self-hating and anti-British when even somebody named Sayeeda Warsi can regonize it. OF <span class="caps">COURSE </span>such proposals &#8220;could actually damage cohesion.&#8221; It&rsquo;s hard to believe they have any other intention. This is nothing less than ethnic cleansing   &mdash;   OF whites, BY whites. </p>
<p>I concur with previous posters who&rsquo;ve said that Britain has lost its mind. I&rsquo;ve always been a pretty mainstream conservative, not a WN and certainly not any sort of radical or extremist. But if I were living in <span class="caps">UK,</span> I&rsquo;d be voting British National Party. Only Nick Griffin and the <span class="caps">BNP </span>can save that once-great nation now   &mdash;   assuming the local Stalinists don&rsquo;t succeed in their relentless attempts to lock him up for Thoughtcrime. </p>
<p>Would you spare just <span class="caps">ONE HOUR </span>to help your own people survive? Of course you would. So tonight, skip your stupid sitcoms and cop shows and watch <span class="caps">THIS </span>instead: </p>
<p>https://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=1808</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 56 minutes of Nick Griffin on his recent speaking tour of the <span class="caps">US.</span> Unlike the chaos caused by commie hooligans who disrupted Mr. Griffin&rsquo;s talk at Michigan State, the students at Clemson University in SC actually <span class="caps">KEPT QUIET </span>and let the man speak. And <span class="caps">BOY</span> OH <span class="caps">BOY </span>does he <span class="caps">SPEAK</span>! </p>
<p>Griffin gives a remarkable performance   &mdash;   one that&rsquo;s as relevant and important to Americans as it is to Brits   &mdash;   so <span class="caps">PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE </span>take the Incredible Shrinking White Man&rsquo;s advice and check it out. You won&rsquo;t be sorry   &mdash;   and your grandchildren will thank you! </p>

					<p>&#8220;In Britain we have alot of &ldquo;christianity-haters&rdquo; (like some on Amren), however the christianity-haters in Britain are usually white liberal atheists. These white liberal atheists denounce christianity as homophobic but at the same time seem to see no problem with the huge growth of Islam in Britain. We live in a world full of strange paradoxes.&#8221; </p>
<p>Posted by AF (uk) at 8:41 PM on November 1 </p>
<p>I am sorry, you are wrong.  I am against Christianity as I am all relgion, yet do not classify myself as an atheist.  I am against it because I see it as ultimately a betrayal of whites.  These people you and others are constantly calling communists think that they are being good Christians - ask them.  There is a mistaken assuption among many whites that Christianity is part of Western White culture.  I argue that it is not, but historically has inserted itself in the West through mostly force over two thousand years.  Force and a huge amount of deceit.  That it was there when Islam formented another Arabic/Persian drive West is coincidental.  But the situation is changed today.  The East is still pushing West, but it is the modern phenomenae of global and national economics that plagues the West today and makes the survival of Western culture so perilous.  But commerce is a Western/European construct.  Governments are faced with creating a tax base for older whites to draw upon because they did not have enough children to keep the economies growing.  Zero Population Growth used to be practically a religion in the white West, but it never caught on in the rest of the world.  Economies don&rsquo;t want to shrink, it is too painful, so they want new members.  This is why they are letting in so many outsiders.  Is this working?  Perhaps in the short run, but it won&rsquo;t in the long run.  I agree that some religions and cultures and races just can&rsquo;t mix successfully.  One will dominate the other.  However, at some point, we must accept that there is a limit to expansion.  I think we are very near it.</p>
<p>Christmas was first a &#8220;pagan&#8221; holiday celebrating the Solstice in many particular outlooks in Europe.  The Sol Invictus religion of Rome and also the Mithraic form had their high holidays at the solstices.  The winter solstice was perhaps the most important because they sincerely believed that the sun must be beckoned back from its retreat from them.  It is very well documented historically that the early Christians in Rome appropriated that and other holidays like Easter to make Christianity more readily acceptable.  So I celebrate &#8220;Christmas&#8221; - but more as a time to remember the history of the day.  I like all the traditional movies, etc.  I ignore the insistence that it is about Jesus.  I know what it is really about.</p>
<p>But you can count me and probably the other contrarian posters on Amren as more realist than most posters.  Most seem to want to return to the &#8220;Good Ol&rsquo;Days.&#8221;  That will never happen.  The dynamics of communication and population density, etc., won&rsquo;t allow it.  The old Southern Baptist style cross burning, Jew hating, ni&&#r hanging white will gain no traction anywhere.  The &#8220;real&#8221; realist who wants to see the white race survive has to move beyond that and figure out how to have a community in spirit that supports certain personal behavior that results in the survival of the white race.  That Christianity is a part of the white Western culture is a debate I never shrink from.  I would rather that we study pre-Christian outlooks in Europe as our truer spiritual models.  </p>
<p>Yea, there before me do I see my father,</p>
<p>Yea, there before me do I see my mother,</p>
<p>Yea, there before me do I see my sister and my brother.</p>
<p>Yea, there do I see my people who have gone before me -</p>
<p>To Vahalla, where the brave may live forever!</p>
<p>Scientifically, there is no Vahalla, just as there is not heaven or hell, but the spirit needs romance and this is a rallying cry for the white race!</p>
<p>Homework assignment, read &#8220;The Ring of the Nibelungen&#8221; or Beowulf.  Notice how Christianity uses deceit and betrayal to undo the old gods.  These are the oldest European hero epics and they depict the &#8220;first fall&#8221; of white Europe to an invading and pernicious religion.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;Action to &lsquo;ensure access&rsquo; for ethnic minorities to &lsquo;largely white&rsquo; countryside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eh?  Theres cars, trains, buses, hiking trails, cycle paths, public footpaths and roads, and most of the countryside is easily accessable from all the major towns and cities.  All you have to do is get up and go there.  Why do we need to &#8220;ensure access&#8221; to the countryside for ethnic minorities? Are they that dumb that they dont know how to drive, ride a bike, take a bus or train, or don a pair of walking boots?  I can walk 30 minutes north  of where I live, take a 15 minute journey on an open top bus, or take a 5 minute drive, and I am in some of the most beautiful, rolling downland and woodland.  I can see deer, foxes, badgers, kestrels, hawks, and I can take a picnic in a meadow.  Its not that difficult, you just have to do it.   </p>

					<p>&#8220;We fool ourselves, however, if we believe that these pseudo-liberal elites are in any way open to rational persuasion. I will give you an example. The books that are reviewed on Amazon are generally given favourable reviews by their intended readership, with only a few dissentients, if any. This means that a book written from a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; perspective will be favourably reviewed by so-called liberals, and the dissenting reviews of conservatives will be rated accordingly (e.g. &ldquo;1 out of 25 readers found this review helpful&rdquo;).&#8221; </p>

<p>&gt; Might it simply mean that conservatives don&rsquo;t read very much?  Might it also mean that conservative writers aren&rsquo;t read that much?</p>

					<p>&#8220;The agenda we see at work in this story is about creating a borderless world w/ one central gov&rsquo;t (probably the UN) which is based on Socialism/Marxism. The leftist elite masters figure people had better start to get along and, thus, forcing people to live together and encouraging &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; is the way to do it. I call these elites the &ldquo;hippie globalists&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But perhaps the &ldquo;hippie globalists&rdquo; are merely pawns or useful idiots to the real elite masters, ie. the economic globalists (the Rockefellers, central bankers, etc). The economic globalists also want a borderless world w/ one central gov&rsquo;t. They however only seek to enrich themselves and turn the masses of the world into serfs.<br>
Note that economic globalist organizations such as the Rockefeller Fund are the primary funding source for endless &ldquo;hippie globalist&rdquo; organizations. Hence, the economic globalist push/fund &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; and other social engineering simply because they know it will lead to balkanization &amp; conflict and this will tear apart any society in which it (ie. multiculturalism) is practiced&hellip;. the ultimate goal being to destroy all Western countries since the West stands as the biggest obstacle towards global government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&gt; Right on the mark, Mark!  (BTW my firstname is Mark!)</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard on the old hippies though.  I recall the era well.  The baby boom generation was growing up under the constant threat of nuclear annilation.  Their response was to drop out of the world and preach love and peace as a better alternative to blowing the world up.  It was too simple and they (we) were young and naive.  It was later that the Marxists arrived with drugs to stupefy them into radicals.  What we have today is post hippie, feminist mommism that thinks it can make us all behave and swallow the medicine.<br>

					<p>This may well be the hidden labor agenda but it was intended to be hidden.<br>
What it effectively does is to negate the entire history of Britain.  I cannot believe that anyone who is British, except the most insane leftist, would ever accept this nonsense.<br><br>
One interesting point about the one worlders is that they are all european and the nation states that they wish to abolish are also all european.  Since nation states are based on a shared history and race they are a threat to the one worlders.  What they do not understand is that man has no real identity aside from his connection with his nation state, with his past and his race.  If they ever succeed they will be left with a mass of truly alienated souls.</p>

<p>You mean those &#8220;pre-Christian outlooks&#8221; that never got white people anywhere, prevented them from accomplishing anything without the benefit of massive imported slave labor that could not help but eventually destroy them?  I assure you, without Christianity, our intelligence would have been wasted.  If you think Christianity is not burrowed deep in the hearts of white people, go to the movies.  And I don&rsquo;t mean some elitist &#8220;art film&#8221; trash.  I&rsquo;m talking about the movies that white people actually go to see.  You&rsquo;ll find that they are almost always Christian.  If you hate Christianity, you hate white people.<br>

					<p>She added: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t build community cohesion by throwing out our history and denying the fundamental contribution Christianity has played and does play to our nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a British Muslim I can see that &mdash; so why others can&rsquo;t just staggers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Firstly, Ms Warsi, it is not &#8216;our&rsquo; history. Your history resides exclusively in the Indian sub-continent. </p>
<p>Secondly, there are plenty of others who <span class="caps">CAN </span>see what is happening to &#8216;our&rsquo; society-and we regard <span class="caps">YOU </span>as part of the problem. <br>
I suppose you think I should be grateful that you recognise the importance of Christianity to Britain, but do you really think the pathetic bone you are throwing me in any way makes up for the fact that one day your people will be the majority in my-sorry, &#8216;our&rsquo; homeland? <br><br>
I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me where I come from, or who I am. I don&rsquo;t care whether you recognise the importance of Christianity or not, and the fact that your main concern is that this proposed legislation would &#8216;damage cohesion&rsquo; merely shows that your ultimate concern is maintaining your place in my country, not the interests of the British people. </p>

					<p>Huh, Christmas downgraded? I have news for most Christians who might be a bit deluded. They have already accomplished much of the downgrading, all by themselves. Whether it is televangilists, priests, or reverends, pastors, etc. their  defense of the holiday they claim to be so important to their faith, during the past ten years or more during which it has been systematically attacked, has been tried  &mdash;  and found wanting.  </p>

					<p>I suggest the Muslims infesting the UK unite and write a new constitution declaring what is and isn&rsquo;t acceptable to them and that it become the new law of the land.  After all, the British subjects would not oppose it and the British Parliament would declare it to be the finest state document ever written in the history of what used to be their islands&hellip;              </p>
