Two Petaluma store employees and a shopping center customer were beaten by reputed gang members, apparently for wearing red clothing, police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The attacks happened near the Staples office supply store on South McDowell Boulevard, where police said two workers and another person were assaulted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was the second attack in Petaluma over colors in two months. In April, a 12-year-old boy was hit on the head with a skateboard after he refused to take off a red shirt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The three people assaulted at the Washington Square Shopping Center wore red. The Staples employees were dressed in red uniform polo shirts.</p>
<p>None of the victims were gang members, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In one instance, a Staples employee was standing outside the store when the suspects began yelling gang slogans and challenging him to fight, Petaluma Police Sgt. Dave Kahl said.</p>
<p>He started to walk into the store when they began hitting him with their fists, Kahl said.</p>
<p>Another employee came to his aid and also was assaulted, Kahl said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One victim was 18 and the other was 21.</p>
<p>A third victim, whose age was not available, flagged down an officer in the parking lot and said the two suspects were driving a large, light-colored sedan, Kahl said.</p>
<p>Police stopped the car nearby and witnesses identified the occupants as the suspects, Kahl said.</p>
<p>Both were arrested and booked on suspicion of committing battery for gang purposes, Kahl said.</p>
<p>The male suspect also was held on suspicion of drunken driving, Kahl said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Staples spokeswoman said Tuesday it wasn&rsquo;t the first time an employee was beaten by gang members for wearing the company&rsquo;s red attire.</p>
<p>The Framingham, Mass.-based company has 190 stores in California and workers clad in Staples&rsquo; polo shirts have been assaulted at other stores because the color is claimed by gangs, spokeswoman Amy Shanler said.</p>
<p>In some cases, the company has changed the uniform to prevent further attacks, Shanler said. She wouldn&rsquo;t say where the company had changed its uniform colors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have changed the uniform before because of the gang situation,&#8221; Shanler said. &#8220;There hasn&rsquo;t been anything discussed as far as this situation.&#8221;</p>
