						<p>A 14-year-old girl was murdered by a takeaway owner who joked with friends that she had been chopped up and mixed in with the kebabs, a court has heard.</p>
<p>It is alleged that Charlene Downes was killed by Iyad Albattikhi, who owns a fast food shop on Blackpool Promenade.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Charlene was one of a number of girls who had sex with men who worked in fast food shops on the promenade, including Mr Albattikhi.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old, from Blackpool, denies murder at Preston Crown Court.</p>
<p>Tim Holroyde QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Charlene, from Buchanan Street in Blackpool, spent her time hanging around the promenade.</p>
<p>She kissed her mother goodbye on the evening of Saturday 1 November 2003 and vanished off the face of the earth, Mr Holroyde said.</p>
<p>Police started a missing persons inquiry, but later launched a murder probe after being told she had been &#8220;killed and chopped up&#8221;, the jury heard.</p>
<p>No trace of Charlene&rsquo;s body has been found.</p>
<p>Mr Holroyde told the jury a witness heard Mr Albattikhi &mdash; owner of the Funny Boyz fast food shop &mdash; and others talking about &#8220;sex with white girls&#8221;, including a mention of Charlene.</p>
<p>&#8220;He and others present were then laughingly saying that Charlene had gone into the kebabs,&#8221; Mr Holroyde said.</p>
<p>Both Mr Albattikhi, a Jordanian immigrant, and his business partner 50-year-old Mohammed Reveshi &mdash; who is accused of helping dispose of the body &mdash; told police they never knew Charlene.</p>
<p>The pair were joint owners of the fast food shop on Dickson Road where Charlene became a familiar figure hanging around, the court heard.</p>
<p>Mr Holroyde said she was one of a number of adolescent girls who sometimes went at night to an alleyway to meet much older men from the restaurants, sometimes for sex.</p>
<p>Mr Holroyde said that it was the prosecution&rsquo;s case that there was some sexual activity between Charlene and one &mdash; or both &mdash; the defendants.</p>
<p>Both the accused were spoken to after Charlene disappeared but told police they did not know her, the court heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the reason for their lying is that one of them murdered her and the other helped dispose of her body,&#8221; Mr Holroyde told the jury.</p>
<p><b>Property bugged</b></p>
<p>In 2004, Mr Albattikhi fell out with his brother, Tariq, who told a witness &mdash; David Cassidy &mdash; that Charlene &#8220;had been killed and chopped up and there had been a lot of blood,&#8221; Mr Holroyde said.</p>
<p>Mr Cassidy was allegedly warned by Mr Albattikhi that &#8220;he would be dealt with&#8221; if he told anyone, and was later offered £20,000 by Mr Reveshi, the jury heard.</p>
<p>He went to police in December 2004 and detectives bugged their flats, as well as Mr Reveshi&rsquo;s Fiat people carrier.</p>
<p>In one of the resulting tapes Mr Reveshi is heard saying the words &#8220;eat the body&#8221; in a joking tone, Mr Holroyde told the court.</p>
<p>Mr Albattikhi is heard on one tape saying that if &#8220;anything&#8221; was found he had &#8220;had it&#8221;.</p>
<p>The trial was adjourned until Friday.</p>
