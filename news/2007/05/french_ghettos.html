<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>During the first round of France&rsquo;s presidential election, Laurence Ribeaucourt had the surprise of her political life.</p>
<p>A social worker and local councillor in a poor suburb north-east of Paris, she was monitoring the vote and the last place she expected to see the deprived youths she had cared for over the years was a polling station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all of them turned up &mdash; I had never seen such political commitment,&#8221; Ms Ribeaucourt marvels.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a moving moment. For most of them it was the first time they had voted. Some did not even know what booths were for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many youths stayed behind to help count the ballots &mdash; as every French voter is entitled to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took hours because they had to be taught everything. But it was worth it. They got an education in citizenship,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><b>Triumph</b></p>
<p>Turnout at the polling station was 83% of registered voters. This matched the high national average.</p>
<p>But in one of France&rsquo;s worst sink estates &mdash; where usually only about 40% bother to vote &mdash; it was an unprecedented triumph.</p>
<p>The result may have been exceptional &mdash; but it was replicated in other immigrant suburbs.</p>
<p>In nearby Clichy, one of the most deprived towns in France&rsquo;s poorest department, Seine-Saint-Denis, turnout also topped 80%.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, Clichy&rsquo;s teenagers launched a wave of riots that spread to banlieues (suburbs) across France.</p>
<p>Today, local youths &mdash; most of whom have French citizenship &mdash; are eager to air their grievances by casting ballots, not burning cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electing a president is important,&#8221; says first-time voter Alain Djoudjou, 18.</p>
<p>He recalls that in the previous presidential election in 2002, far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen made it to the run-off largely through voter apathy. &#8220;Each votes counts,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In Clichy &mdash; as in many other French suburbs &mdash; the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of Segolene Royal.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the Socialist candidate appeals to banlieue youths.</p>
<p>Unlike her second-round conservative rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, she did bother to come to Clichy during the campaign. She is seen as reassuring and tolerant, and has promised to &#8220;listen to our suburbs where the fire is still smouldering&#8221;. Her pledge to create subsidised jobs strikes a chord in areas where unemployment is sky-high.</p>
<p>Lofti Allag, 22, a plumbing worker from Clichy, is particularly attracted by Ms Royal&rsquo;s pledge to raise the minimum wage by 19%. &#8220;I&rsquo;d feel great about that,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Open season&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>But to most young men in the suburbs, Ms Royal&rsquo;s main attraction is that she is not Mr Sarkozy.</p>
<p>Journalist Nadir Dendoune, who noted the same unprecedented level of mobilisation near Saint-Denis north of Paris, says: &#8220;It was a vote against Sarkozy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As interior minister, he antagonised many people by speaking about cleaning estates &#8220;with a pressure hose&#8221; and called delinquents &#8220;rabble&#8221; &mdash; a word widely used in the suburb but seen as offensive from a minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not like his word,&#8221; says Karim Hamdoune, an 18-year-old from Clichy, who feels that Mr Sarkozy &#8220;branded all Arab youths as criminals&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mehdi Bigaderne, of AC Le Feu, an association highlighting the plight of neglected suburbs, calls Mr Sarkozy &#8220;scary, unpredictable and dangerously divisive&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the former interior minister&rsquo;s legacy, in the eyes of young banlieue voters, is his decision to drop community policing in favour of tough law-and-order measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sniff&#8221;, a 25-year-old from Clichy who says he has been beaten by police officers, blames Mr Sarkozy for the sharp deterioration in relations between police and youths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been parked in sink estates and cops come here to taunt us,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve seen what he did as a minister and I don&rsquo;t want him as president.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Women&rsquo;s vote</b></p>
<p>Many youths say they are much more worried about Mr Sarkozy than they ever were about Mr Le Pen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Le Pen was seen as a troublemaker rather than a serious politician,&#8221; says Akram Belkaid, a journalist with the business daily La Tribune. &#8220;There was never a danger of him becoming president.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some are finding imaginative ways of fighting Mr Sarkozy.</p>
<p>Omar Dawson, who runs a youth association in Grigny, south of Paris, secretly recorded on his mobile phone a meeting between the candidate and activists in February, and posted the clip on the web.</p>
<p>In it, Mr Sarkozy is heard using typically blunt language about his own immigrant origins and the duties of newcomers.</p>
<p>Mr Dawson says he &#8220;wanted to show a different image of someone who might be our future president&#8221; &mdash; although the clip appears unlikely to change anyone&rsquo;s view of the tough-talking former minister.</p>
<p>Concern about Mr Sarkozy, however, is far from universal in the banlieues. In Seine-Saint-Denis, more than a quarter of voters voted for the centre-right candidate.</p>
<p>Many pensioners living near estates support Mr Sarkozy&rsquo;s firm stance on crime &mdash; and so do a large number of women residents.</p>
<p>Sonya Latrache, a 30-year-old mother of five from Clichy, says she finds Mr Sarkozy much more reassuring than his rival.</p>
<p>&#8220;She does not speak with clarity and conviction; it&rsquo;s just hot air. She is nice but she will do nothing,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Sarkozy, you know where you stand. He wants to help people get back to work and stands for discipline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most women around here will tell you that we need him to clean the place up.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Mobilisation</b></p>
<p>And indeed, this is the opinion you generally hear when you speak to young girls and mothers across Seine Saint-Denis.</p>
<p>Elodie, a 22-year-old from Montreuil a few miles from Clichy, says she trusts Mr Sarkozy to improve security. &#8220;In my estate, he is called racist but I don&rsquo;t agree,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, Ms Royal will have the suburbs&rsquo; vote. Whether this will help her capture the presidency is unclear.</p>
<p>But whatever the final result, Ms Ribeaucourt says she is optimistic about the growing political influence of the banlieues.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to take part in public affairs,&#8221; she says. &#8220;On every issue they will remain mobilised.&#8221;</p>
