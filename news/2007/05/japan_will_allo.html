<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Japan will open its borders to more foreign workers to keep the economy growing as its population ages, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Mitoji Yabunaka said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s population began declining in 2005 and the government said earlier this year that it may fall by as much as a quarter by 2050. Japan has never had to rely on mass immigration, unlike countries such as the U.S. and Australia that were founded by migrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Foreigners accounted for 1.6 percent of Japan&rsquo;s 128 million population last year. Almost half of the 2 million people that the government classifies as foreigners are people of Chinese, Korean and Brazilian descent who were born in Japan, said Sakanaka, who is a former head of the Tokyo immigration bureau.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s Yabunaka said the government&rsquo;s decision last September to allow 1,000 Filipino nurses to work in Japan is an example of a more open immigration policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Japanese Test</b></p>
<p>The proposed partnership, still subject to approval by the Philippines congress, requires workers to take six months of lessons in Japanese and nursing, followed by a supervised internship culminating in an examination in Japanese that critics say is so onerous as to make the program impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&rsquo;t address the nursing shortage,&#8221; said Sakanaka. &#8220;Nobody will be able to pass the tests and they&rsquo;ll all be sent home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Japan had six nurses for every 1,000 people in 2004, the most recent year for which government data are available, compared with 8.3 in the U.S. About a fifth of Japan&rsquo;s population is over 65 years old and the percentage is climbing, increasing the demand for health-care services.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&rsquo;s key economic panel last week proposed that the number of foreign students in the country be more than doubled as a way to bring in skilled labor from abroad.</p>
