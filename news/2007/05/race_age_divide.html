<h1>Race, Age Divide Nevada</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Koch and Mary Manning, Las Vegas Sun, May 29, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Once again, Nevada stands out in a new round of statistics about emerging demographic trends.</p>
<p>As a national population, we are polarizing along demographic lines &mdash; older citizens who are mostly white, and younger ones from the ranks of minorities, government numbers show.</p>
<p>The emerging racial generation divide, as sociologists and demographers call it, is more obvious in Nevada than most states, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data released this month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Will an older, white electorate be sympathetic to a large population of Hispanic, black and Asian-American non voting teens over such issues as, say, the need for new schools?</p>
<p>That question will play out next year when the Clark County School District seeks voter approval for a multibillion-dollar school construction bond, the largest such initiative in state history and the first since 1998, when voters approved $4.9 billion for new educational facilities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census Bureau reported that the nation&rsquo;s minority population topped 100 million in 2006 and that about one in three U.S. residents today is a minority.</p>
<p>The racial generation gaps are widest in California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, according to a New York Times analysis of the government&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>Nevada State Demographer Jeff Hardcastle says non whites under voting age in Nevada have increased by more than 116,500 since 2000 and now make up 51 percent of the younger-than-18 population, compared with 44 percent in 2000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he said, the state&rsquo;s white population older than 50 has increased by nearly 140,000. Among Nevadans older than 50, 79 percent are white, compared with 82 percent in 2000.</p>
<p>(The percentage of whites of all ages in Nevada as part of the state&rsquo;s population has dropped to 59 percent in 2006, from 66 percent in 2000.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fernando Romero, president of Hispanics in Politics in Las Vegas, said Hispanic activists struggle for political support from older whites .</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve already seen how it has hurt in recent years when highly qualified Hispanics ran in county wide races and lost,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen white voters with little knowledge of either candidate vote for the opponent of the Hispanic candidate based on name alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Mather, deputy director of domestic programs for the Population Reference Bureau, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, D.C., says the racial generation gap is a relatively recent phenomenon and may not be long-lived because immigrant fertility rates follow historic trends and taper off by the third or fourth generation.</p>
<p>Mather says more than one in five children in the United States either is foreign-born or has a parent who was born abroad. Such demographics have changed the face of Nevada and America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevada is at the cutting edge of America&rsquo;s new demographic shifts,&#8221; said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Frey said such shifts can be attributed to the spillover of Hispanics and Asian-Americans from California, new immigrants and in-migration of aging whites.</p>
<p>As the minority population ages, more are joining the ranks of voters. The Census Bureau found that Nevada&rsquo;s voting-age population boomed 25 percent from 2000 to 2006, with minorities accounting for 63 percent of that increase. School officials say that although that statistic doesn&rsquo;t guarantee smooth sailing, it certainly helps their cause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Veteran local political consultant Kent Oram said larger ethnic groups &#8220;are not voting near to the proportion of their numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>From census information and a search of surnames, Oram estimates that, nationally, white voters outnumber minorities by more than 2-to-1.</p>
