<h1><a href="http://www.townonline.com/watertown/homepage/x1790357232">Man Wants &lsquo;No Place For Hate&rsquo; Sign To Come Down</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Watertown Tab (Watertown, Massachusetts), May 10, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Ralph Filicchia came across a &#8220;No Place for Hate&#8221; sign on a pole outside Town Hall, he was, to put it in his own words &#8220;offended.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he came before the council with a message and a plea to take down the sign and rescind a Town Council proclamation honoring Watertown as a &#8220;No Place for Hate&#8221; community.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proclamation is discriminatory and a violation and infringement upon my civil rights as an American citizen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want the right to speak out without being guilty of a hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within 30 days he wants the sign gone, and the proclamation taken back.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Will Twombly, a co-chairman of the committee with Watertown Police Sgt. David Sampson, sees it in a completely different light.</p>
<p>In 1999, the &#8220;No Place for Hate&#8221; program was created by the Anti-Defamation League New England Region, in partnership with the Massachusetts Municipal Association, to &#8220;provide communities with a solid framework for promoting an inclusive environment while fighting all forms of hate and bigotry,&#8221; according to their Web site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Filicchia is no stranger to speaking his mind. He is a regular contributor to the letters page of the TAB &amp; Press and other area news sources.</p>
<p>Adopted unanimously by the Town Council in 2005, the proclamation commits the town to the criteria to be a &#8220;No Place for Hate&#8221; municipality, with a &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; policy toward bigotry, along with the completion of three activities to be eligible for certification.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No word yet on what action, if any, the town will take on his request.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No Place&rsquo; for a proclamation?</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously in 2005 to adopt the &#8220;No Place for Hate&#8221; resolution, which was supported by the police department, School Superintendent Dr. Steven Hiersche, representatives of local churches, the Watertown Food Pantry, The World in Watertown and the Watertown Commission on Disabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas all acts of subtle or overt racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and ethnic bigotry substantially undermine our communities, schools and the promise of equal justice;</p>
<p>And whereas our nation was founded on the fundamental conviction that all persons are entitled to equal protection, equal opportunity and the enjoyment of civil rights;</p>
<p>And whereas the strength of our nation is derived from the growing diversity of our communities;</p>
<p>And whereas the Anti-Defamation League and the Massachusetts Municipal Association and other coalition members are sponsoring a program designed to help communities develop and take specific actions to combat bias and promote respect for people;</p>
<p>And whereas Watertown, Massachusetts, has committed to fulfill the criteria to become a &#8220;No Place for Hate&#8221; municipality;</p>
<p>And whereas we can work to solve the problem of hate and build bridges to communities only by taking strategic and specific actions to create a feeling of welcome inclusion.&#8221;</p>
