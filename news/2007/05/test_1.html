<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>It&rsquo;s been a brisk season for official apologies.  On February 24th, Virginia  led the pack into the confessional when the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/02/AR2007020201203.html"> state legislature</a> unanimously passed a bill  expressing <b>&quot;profound contrition&quot;</b> for slavery.  Since then, the Maryland Senate, the North Carolina  Senate, and the Alabama legislature have all voted  to  beat their breasts over slavery. Even the board  of the University of Virginia marked the birthday of  the university&rsquo;s founder &mdash; Thomas  Jefferson &mdash; by apologizing because UVA once used  slave labor. There are similar apologies <a href="https://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ/MGArticle/WSJ_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1173350745937"> brewing</a> in the  Georgia and  Missouri legislatures.  </p>
<p>Now that four states of the  former Confederacy have eaten crow, it will look  bad if the rest don&rsquo;t. Expect a torrent.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on? The black sponsors of statehouse  apologies say they want reconciliation. <b>&quot;Some of  us can&rsquo;t move into reconciliation until we have an  apology,&quot;</b> <a href="https://blog.al.com/spotnews/2007/04/senate_house_pass_slaveryapolo.html"> says Hank Sanders</a>, who backed the Alabama  resolution. The Virginia vote was <b>&quot;part of a  healing process,&quot;</b> explains <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=CDP/MGArticle/CDP_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149192673260"> Delegate A. Donald McEachin</a>. &nbsp; </p>
<p>The chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of  Maryland says the same thing: <b>&quot;The first step for  healing to take place is for there to be an  acknowledgment,&quot;</b> says state senator Nathaniel  Exum. [<i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031602551.html">&lsquo;Regret&rsquo;  Over Md. Role in Slavery</a>| State Senate  Resolution Follows Similar Action in Virginia, By  Ovetta Wiggins</i> <i>Washington Post</i> March 17,  2007] </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all for healing &mdash; who isn&rsquo;t? &mdash; but everyone  knows that has nothing to do with it. Even the white  legislators who  obediently hung their heads over  something they never did tried to be careful to  draft resolutions that would avoid  raids on the treasury. <b>&quot;Profound regret,&quot;</b>  and <b>  &quot;profound contrition&quot;</b> were the favorite  formulations that stop short of an outright apology  that might lead to demands for reparations.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good reason to be crafty. In the minds of  blacks, <b>&quot;healing&quot;</b> clearly requires more than <b>&quot;profound contrition.&quot;</b> The Virginia vote was <b>&quot;a good first step,&quot;</b> says Del. McEachin, who  likes to tell reporters his great-grandfather was a  slave.  </p>
<p>Senator Exum of Maryland says the vote on slavery  was nice, but the state must <b>&#8220;recognize  <a href="https://www.flyernews.com/article.php?section=Opinions&amp;volume=54&amp;issue=36&amp;artnum=03">  steps we need to do</a> to get rid of the  lingering effects of it.&quot;</b> Bruce Gordon,  president of the Virginia NAACP, complained that  words don&rsquo;t heal anything. He, too, wants to stamp  out <b>&quot;lingering  inequalities.&quot;</b>  </p>
<p><b>&quot;Don&rsquo;t let it end here,&quot;</b> said state  senator Larry Shaw after the North Carolina vote. <b> <a href="https://www.dailyreportonline.com/Editorial/News/new_singleEdit.asp?individual_SQL=4/8/2007@14515_Public_.htm"> &quot;There&rsquo;s plenty of work to be done.&quot;</a></b> </p>
<p><b>&quot;Work&quot;</b> means money; your money. That is  why  Charles Bishop was one of seven Alabama state  senators who voted against the resolution. <b>&quot;What  I am is somebody who hates to see lawyers take  advantage of the General Fund of the state of  Alabama and suck it like a leech,&quot;</b> he explained.  [<i>Alabama  House, Senate approve slavery apologies</i><i>, </i>By Phillip Rawls, Associated Press, April 24,  2007] </p>
<p>Cowed as they are, whites will still draw the  line at  paying reparations for slavery. Blacks who have  started <a href="https://www.snopes.com/business/taxes/blacktax.asp"> thinking how to spend the check</a> had better hold  off &mdash; for now.  </p>
<p>But these votes of <b>&quot;profound regret&quot;</b> are  far from innocuous, and they have nothing to do with <b>&quot;reconciliation.&quot;</b>  </p>
<p>Stripped of all pretence, what they do is make  whites say to blacks, <b><i>&quot;Our people have been  very, very, very bad to your people, and we will  never forget it. Please forgive us.&quot;</i></b> And  they make whites say it publicly, officially,  formally, in the name of an entire state.  </p>
<p>This is an expression of  naked racial power. It makes it blindingly clear  who are the moral creditors and who are the debtors.  Blacks don&rsquo;t want <b>&#8220;healing&quot;</b>; they want  the moral whip hand. They will never, ever  put slavery behind them so long as they can make  whites feel bad about it. They want every  policy, every conversation, and even every  thought about  race in America to start and end with  white guilt and innocent black suffering. They  will milk white contrition for as much and for as  long as whites let them.  </p>
<p>A few people recognize a stickup when they see  it. When the idea of apologizing for slavery first  came up in the Virginia General Assembly,  79-year-old Delegate Frank Hargrove was having none  of it. </p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been slavery for 140 years, he said,  and <b>&quot;our black citizens should get over it.&quot;</b>  [<i><a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=CDP/MGArticle/CDP_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149192673260">Slavery  apology measure ignites legislative debate</a>, </i> By Bob Gibson, <i>Richmond Daily Progress</i>,  January 16, 2007] </p>
<p>The  wrath of <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16688755/"> all liberaldom</a> descended on Mr. Hargrove, and he  quickly wilted. Not only did he change his mind and  vote for the resolution, he even added an extra bit  of <b>&quot;profound contrition&quot;</b>: He <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/22/AR2007012200958.html"> introduced a proposal</a> that Virginia celebrate <b> &quot;<a href="https://www.juneteenth.com/">Juneteenth</a>&quot;</b> &mdash; June  19, 1865, when the last slaves got word they were  free &mdash; as a  state holiday.  </p>
<p>Blacks will continue this contrition caper  indefinitely &mdash; until whites wake up.<br>
