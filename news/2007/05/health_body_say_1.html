						<p>RACE EXPERTS hit the roof after an institution claimed figures showing Black people 18 times more likely to be mentally ill was an &#8220;under-estimate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mental health professionals are outraged after the Institute of Psychiatry concluded there was no evidence of racism.</p>
<p>A report by the body claimed Africans and Caribbeans suffer from even higher rates of schizophrenia than statistics suggest.</p>
<p>Lee Jasper, chair of the African Caribbean Mental Health Commission, rejected the findings. &lsquo;We are seeing racism on an industrial scale in the mental health service.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you look at the staggering disproportionality of representation within the service then I think there is no other credible explanation to this problem than institutional racism.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>denial</b></p>
<p>Professor Robin Murray from the Institute of Psychiatry has denied existence of racism in mental health for many years. Now he has released a report that fits his predetermined position.</p>
<p>Prof Murray&rsquo;s views have been regarded as controversial, but now he has gained support from Black and Asian professionals who are joining him in denying racism.</p>
<p>Dr Shibalade Smith, who works in the Maudsley hospital, and Professor Swaran Singh both back Prof Murray.</p>
<p>Their opinions are at odds with official figures that show police twice as likely to refer African Caribbeans to the mental health system.</p>
<p>African and Caribbean groups were also up to 70% less likely to be referred for counseling by their GP, and 14% more likely to be turned away than white people when they ask for help from Mental Health services.</p>
<p>The <b>Count Me In</b> study last year also found that 88% of Black respondents had been forcibly restrained as opposed to 43% of white respondents.</p>
<p><b>troubled</b></p>
<p>Despite these figures, the Institute of Psychiatry ruled out racism as a cause, and instead blamed absent fathers, cannabis use and a traumatic upbringing &mdash; all factors which they say disproportionately affect Black communities.</p>
<p>Prof Murray said that psychiatrists were less likely to diagnose Black people with mental illness because they were afraid of being branded &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also alleged that dangerous psychopaths like Christopher Clunis who killed Jayne Zito in 1992 &mdash; were being released into the community because health professionals wanted to reduce the numbers of Black patients.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Psychiatrists are less likely to diagnose psychosis in somebody who is Black than white with the same symptoms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said the causes of mental illness were &#8220;unemployment, living in the city, [being] separated from parents&#8221;, and believes migrant communities are naturally more prone to mental illness.</p>
<p>Dr Smith, whose patients are 77% Black, said she believed the causes were &#8220;poor schooling, troubled childhood [and] cannabis.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;There is no evidence Black patients are likely to get more medication. In fact you are twice as likely to get ECT [electric shock treatment] if you are white than if you are black.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Institute of Psychiatry base their findings on a series of &#8220;blind&#8221; tests where they presented images and imaginary case histories of black and white patients and asked professionals to make a diagnosis.</p>
<p>The findings are a major departure from thirty years of research which suggests that racial prejudices determine how professionals treat Black people with suspected mental disorders.</p>
<p>In 2004 a public inquiry led by former high court judge Sir John Blofeld found that David &lsquo;Rocky&rsquo; Bennett had died of restraint in a psychiatric unit because of institutional racism.</p>
<p>BBC Newsnights&rsquo; Mark Easton publicised the Institute of Psychiatry research earlier this week but failed to offer any critical analysis of the study, accepting the results on face value.<br>
