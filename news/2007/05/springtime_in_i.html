<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Situated within a dense forest at the foothills of the Catskill Mountains on the outskirts of Hancock, New York, Islamberg is not an ideal place for a summer vacation unless, of course, you are an exponent of the Jihad or a fan of Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>The 70 acre complex is surrounded with &#8220;No trespassing&#8221; signs; the rocky terrain is infested with rattlesnakes; and the woods are home to black bears, coyotes, wolves, and a few bobcats.</p>
<p>The entrance to the community is at the bottom of a very steep hill that is difficult to navigate even on a bright sunny day in May. The road, dubbed Muslim Lane, is unpaved and marred by deep crevices that have been created by torrential downpours. On a wintry day, few, save those with all terrain vehicles, could venture forth from the remote encampment.</p>
<p>A sentry post has been established at the base of the hill.</p>
<p>The sentry, at the time of this visit, is an African American dressed in Islamic garb &mdash; a skull cap, a prayer shawl, and a loose fitting <i>shalwat kameez.</i> He instructs us to turn around and leave. &#8220;Our community is not open to visitors,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Behind the sentry and across a small stream stand dozens of inhabitants of the compound &mdash; the men wearing skull caps and loose fitting tunics, the women in full burqa. They appear ready to deal with any unauthorized intruders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other side of the hill where few dare to go is a tiny village replete with a make-shift learning center (dubbed the &#8220;International Quranic Open University&#8221;); a trailer converted into a Laundromat; a small, green community center; a small and rather squalid grocery store; a newly constructed <i>majid;</i> over forty clapboard homes; and scores of additional trailers.</p>
<p>It is home to hundreds &mdash; all in Islamic attire, and all African-Americans. Most drive late model SUVs with license plates from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The locals say that some work as tollbooth operators for the New York State Thruway, while others are employed at a credit card processing center that maintains confidential financial records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Venturing into the complex last summer, Douglas Hagmann, an intrepid investigator and director of the Northeast Intelligence Service, came upon a military training area at the eastern perimeter of the property. The area was equipped with ropes hanging from tall trees, wooden fences for scaling, a make-shift obstacle course, and a firing range. Hagmann said that the range appeared to have been in regular use.</p>
<p>Islamberg is not as benign as a Buddhist monastery or a Carmelite convent. Nearly every weekend, neighbors hear sounds of gunfire. Some, including a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, have heard the bang of small explosives. None of the neighbors wished to be identified for fear of &#8220;retaliation.&#8221; &#8220;We don&rsquo;t even dare to slow down when we drive by,&#8221; one resident said. &#8220;They own the mountain and they know it and there is nothing we can do about it but move, and we can&rsquo;t even do that. Who wants to buy a property near that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Islamberg&rsquo;s Grocery Store</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Islamberg is a branch of Muslims of the Americas Inc., a tax-exempt organization formed in 1980 by Pakistani cleric Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani, who refers to himself as &#8220;the sixth Sultan Ul Faqr,&#8221; Gilani, has been directly linked by court documents to Jamaat ul-Fuqra or &#8220;community of the impoverished,&#8221; an organization that seeks to &#8220;purify&#8221; Islam through violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before becoming a citizen of Islamberg or any of the other Fuqra compounds, the recruits &mdash; primarily inner city black men who became converts in prison &mdash; are compelled to sign an oath that reads: &#8220;I shall always hear and obey, and whenever given the command, I shall readily fight for Allah&rsquo;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, thousands of members of the U.S. branches of Jamaat ul-Fuqra traveled to Pakistan for paramilitary training, but encampments, such as Islamberg, are now capable of providing book-camp training so raw recruits are no longer required to travel abroad amidst the increased scrutiny of post 9/11.</p>
<p>Over the years, numerous members of Jamaat ul-Fuqra have been convicted in US courts of such crimes as conspiracy to commit murder, firebombing, gun smuggling, and workers&rsquo; compensation fraud. Others remain leading suspects in criminal cases throughout the country, including ten unsolved assassinations and seventeen fire-bombings between 1979 and 1990.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By 2004 federal investigators uncovered evidence that linked both the DC &#8220;sniper killer&#8221; John Allen Muhammed and &#8220;Shoe Bomber&#8221; Richard Reid to the group and reports surfaced that <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> reporter Daniel Pearl was captured and beheaded in the process of attempting to obtain an interview with Sheikh Gilani in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Even though Jamaat ul-Fuqra has been involved in terror attacks and sundry criminal activities, recruited thousands of members from federal and state penal systems, and appears to be operating paramilitary facilities for militant Muslims, it remains to be placed on the official US Terror Watch List. On the contrary, it continues to operate, flourish, and expand as a legitimate nonprofit, tax-deductible charity.</p>
