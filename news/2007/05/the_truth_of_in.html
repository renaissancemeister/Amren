<h1>The Truth Of Interracial Rape In The United States</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lawrence Auster, FrontPageMagazine.com, May 3, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Like Ahab&rsquo;s search for the Great White Whale, liberals&rsquo; search for the Great White Defendant is relentless and never-ending. When, in 1988, Tawana Brawley&rsquo;s and Al Sharpton&rsquo;s then year-old spectacular charge that several white men including prosecutor Steven Pagones (whose name Brawley had picked out of a newspaper article) had abducted and raped the 15 year old was shown to be completely false, the <i>Nation</i> said it didn&rsquo;t matter, since the charges expressed the <i>essential nature</i> of white men&rsquo;s treatment of black women in this country. When the Duke University lacrosse players were accused of raping a black stripper last year, liberals everywhere treated the accusation as fact, because, just as with the <i>Nation</i> and Tawana Brawley, the rape charge seemed to the minds of liberals to reflect the true nature of oppressive racial and sexual relations in America.</p>
<p>To see the real truth of the matter, let us take a look at the Department of Justice document <i>Criminal Victimization in the United States, 2005.</i> (Go to the linked document, and under &#8220;Victims and Offenders&#8221; download the pdf file for 2005.)</p>
<p>In Table 42, entitled &#8220;Personal crimes of violence, 2005, percent distribution of single-offender victimizations, based on race of victims, by type of crime and perceived race of offender,&#8221; we learn that there were 111,590 white victims and 36,620 black victims of rape or sexual assault in 2005. (The number of rapes is not distinguished from those of sexual assaults; it is maddening that sexual assault, an ill-defined category that covers various types of criminal acts ranging from penetration to inappropriate touching, is conflated with the more specific crime of rape.) In the 111,590 cases in which the victim of rape or sexual assault was white, 44.5 percent of the offenders were white, and 33.6 percent of the offenders were black. In the 36,620 cases in which the victim of rape or sexual assault was black, 100 percent of the offenders were black, and 0.0 percent of the offenders were white. The table explains that 0.0 percent means that there were under 10 incidents nationally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man.</p>
<p>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the real America, week after week, the newspapers report the rapes of white women by black men &mdash; though, of course, without ever once using the words, &#8220;a white woman was raped by black man.&#8221; Just last week in the <i>New York Post</i> there was a story about a serial black rapist who invaded women&rsquo;s apartments on Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper West Side; you knew the rapist was black from a police drawing accompanying the story, and you knew the victims were most likely white from the neighborhoods where the attacks occurred. But even when news media&rsquo;s reports of black on white rape make the race of the perpetrator evident (which the media only does in a minority of instances), no explicit reference is ever made to the racial aspect of the case. Each story of black on white rape is reported in isolation, not presented as part of a larger pattern. There is never the slightest mention of the fact that white women in this country are being targeted by black rapists. In the inverted world of liberalism, the phenomenon does not exist.</p>
