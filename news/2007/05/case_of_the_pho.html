<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials have discovered 42 wedding albums submitted with 42 different citizenship applications in which the guests in the photos were all the same.</p>
<p>All the weddings had supposedly taken place at the same Wedding Palace in Chandigarh in India&rsquo;s Punjab region.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;d have to believe that 42 weddings had the same guests,&#8221; says Mendel Green, president of Green and Spiegel, who has been practising immigration law for 42 years.</p>
<p>Seeing albums with all the same wedding guests and the same wedding hall is something with which his firm is familiar. &#8220;Yes, people have brought fake photos to us,&#8221; says Ravi Jain, a partner with the firm. &#8220;We have seen people posing in the photos. We have seen same wedding halls, same guests over and over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jain says some people are so bold to admit they have a &#8220;paper marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They do so largely to get a visa because they can&rsquo;t qualify as skilled workers and the only way they can qualify is under the family class,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Liberal MP Roy Cullen, who has 29,000 South Asians in his Etobicoke North riding, says many Indo-Canadians in his riding have expressed concerns over this &#8220;abuse&#8221; of the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are telling me it is becoming like an epidemic and it is being seriously abused and so sometime back I spoke with former immigration minister Monte Solberg. I suggested to him &mdash; and I am soon going to write to his successor Diane Finley &mdash; that immigration rules could be amended to issue spousal visas on a probation of say three to five years and if at the end of this period the couple is still in marital relationship, they should be given permanent landed status.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to people getting illegal immigration status with these phoney marriages, Jain says Canadian immigration officers have also started &#8220;over-scrutinizing all family class applications, genuine marriages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have one case involving a pregnant woman and they are refusing that case,&#8221; Jain says. &#8220;This woman in Canada was divorced before. She went to India to marry a guy who was never married before. She got pregnant by him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration has refused a family class visa to the Indian person, arguing an Indian, who has never been married before, would never marry a divorced woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigration officials believe that this Indian man must have paid the Canadian woman $10,000 to $15,000 just to get the Canadian visa.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the theory of the Canadian visa officer who refuses to give him the visa, which is ridiculous,&#8221; Jain says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just awful and doesn&rsquo;t send a good message to the Indian community in Canada that people are using women in the community basically like the prostitutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toronto&rsquo;s Ramesh Maharaj married an Indian woman, Sudha Arora.</p>
<p>They were both divorced and, according to their own beliefs, part of their Hindu religious marriage vows, didn&rsquo;t perform Saptapadi (taking seven steps round the sacred fire) a second time. It was not termed a legal marriage.</p>
<p>Stephen Green, also an immigration attorney at Green and Spiegel, dealt with one case in which the Indo-Canadian woman was slightly physically handicapped.</p>
<p>She married an Indian man with no physical limitations. That too was termed a phony marriage: &#8220;How can an Indian man ever marry a physically handicapped woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>These are two extremes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, absolutely phony marriages are taking place largely to get visa and those cases should be investigated and refused,&#8221; Jain says. &#8220;We know Immigration is aware of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Statistics show about 60,000 Canadians marry overseas each year and file international spousal sponsorships. About 15% are rejected by Canada Citizenship and Immigration. In the case of India, the rate is 23%.</p>
