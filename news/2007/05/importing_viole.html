<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Over the past several years, the U.S. has seen a large influx of immigrants, both legal and illegal, from countries whose values are opposed to the rights guaranteed by the U.S. constitution. Specifically, there are large numbers of immigrants coming from countries that are misogynistic.  These societies accord women little to no rights, and the idea of violence committed by men against women and children is not unusual.</p>
<p>First, take the concept of &lsquo;rapto.&rsquo; This comes from Mexico where in some areas, it is socially acceptable for a man of any age to abduct a female of any age as long as long as he intends to marry her. That is right. Men can kidnap and rape females.  This is acceptable in Oaxaca where the government continues to view rapto as a minor crime. One legislator even referred to this horrid violation as &#8220;romantic.&#8221; Lest anyone believe such garbage, note that 24 year old Mexican immigrant Eliseo Nunez snatched a 12 year old girl and took her to Mexico to fulfill his erotic desires. Isn&rsquo;t that romantic?</p>
<p>The fact is that South American male attitudes toward females are often archaic and misogynistic. Thus it is not surprising that the U.S. is seeing more attacks against women and little girls committed by these immigrants. In August 2005, illegal immigrant Jose Ramirez from El Salvador was charged with the violent attack of a 15-year-old girl who refused to respond when he whistled at her (Roh, 2005).  Perhaps such primitive behavior stems from the homeland culture. El Salvador and Guatemala have had a string of unsolved brutal murders where young females have been abducted and cut apart. Authorities have found body parts, including heads scattered around. In one instance, two female heads were deposited right in front of a local police station, blood still oozing from the severed heads (Miles, 2003).  Gangs are suspected in these crimes because murdering people is often part of their initiation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps the most grotesque and gruesome crime is the rape and murder of a nun by yet another migrant worker from South America. It is amazing that this story received so little attention when imaginary crimes against illegal immigrants are portrayed on television shows in order to gain sympathy for these criminals (i.e. a T.V. show airing an episode where a Minutemen volunteer hurts an illegal immigrant). Thirty three year old Maximiliano Esparza raped and sodomized two nuns and used their rosary beads to control them during the attack. The Sisters were beaten, raped, sodomized, and finally, Esparza used her own rosary beads to strangle Sister Helen Lynn Chaska to death.  Esparza had needed lodging and checked into the Klamath Falls Gospel Mission in Oregon. This Spanish-speaking migrant had spent his evening getting drunk at a local strip club and encountered the nuns as they were walking and saying prayers. Of note, Esparza had a history of criminal behavior and had served a three-year sentence in a California prison. He had been deported one time, and shockingly, U.S. Border Patrol let him go after detaining him a few months prior to the rape/murder.  It doesn&rsquo;t get more vile and disgusting than this.</p>
<p>And yet, there are more such gruesome crimes. Saul Dos Reis is a Brazilian national who found 13 year old Christina Long in an internet chat room. Long was in what she believed to be the safety of her Danbury Connecticut home. Feeling the typical teenaged desires for freedom, Long was drawn in by the twenty something Reis, and agreed to meet him. The Brazilian had sex with her, strangled her, and dumped her lifeless body, like so much worthless trash.</p>
<p>The carnage has continued year after year. Walter Alexander Sorto was an illegal alien and Salvadorian national. Maybe he was one of those wonderful people who break our immigration laws to fill jobs at wages no U.S. citizen can afford to take. Or perhaps, he was not. Like so many others, 25 year old Sorto is a sex killer. In 2003, he snatched, raped, and slaughtered two women in Houston. Most disturbing is the fact that he had been known to police for his prior offenses which included robbery. He was on probation for his robbery when he butchered the women (Hayes, 2004).</p>
<p>If you are not yet disgusted, you will be. Not only are criminal immigrants coming from cultures that are misogynistic, but they are changing U.S. culture in response to their sickness. Many illegal aliens join violent gangs, which take over neighborhoods and terrorize innocent citizens. These gangs are highly organized with tentacles spread through several countries. The mantra of the deadly MS13 gang is: blood in, blood out. And the chilling effects of the illegal aliens participation in these gangs are very far reaching. For example, on December 19, 2002, Victor Cruz, Jose Hernandez, Armando Juvenal, and Carlos Rodriguez were involved with the drawn out gang rape of an unsuspecting 42-year-old New York woman. These illegal aliens were well known to police for their prior crimes of assault, attempted robbery, drug offenses, and illegal gun possession. No deportation followed their lesser offenses because of the sanctuary policy.</p>
<p>However, woman-hating cultures are not confined to South America. The Middle East is full of misogynists and &mdash; for reasons that many consider sinister &mdash; they are migrating to democratic countries. Why migrate to a country whose norms and beliefs are completely opposed to their lifestyle? The reason is that they hope to change these democratic societies. Instead of adopting and assimilating into countries they choose to migrate, they often cluster together in neighborhoods and bring their hate filled belief systems with them. When examining the lives of Muslims all over the world, it is plain that women do not fair well in Islam. In fact, here is a simple quote from volume 1, book 6, number 301:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In other countries to which Muslims have immigrated, there have been atrocious violent crimes committed against women. Germany is seeing the &#8220;smiley.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t know what a smiley is? A smiley is a cut from the side of the mouth to the ear. It is supposed to serve as a warning to Muslim girls to make them wear a veil. For those who don&rsquo;t, the smiley is the punishment of the day.</p>
<p>And other countries are learning about the dangers of importing some Muslims. Rape is acceptable in the Sunna and in the Koran. In Copenhagen, an Islamic mufti said that women who do not wear headscarves are &#8220;asking for rape.&#8221; Likewise, in Australia, a visiting Pakistani committed rape and said his victims had no right to refuse him because they were not covering themselves with headscarves. But it doesn&rsquo;t end there.  In 2004 in London, visiting Egyptian professor Sheik Yusaf al-Qaradawi said rape victims should be punished if they were dressed provocatively when assaulted!</p>
