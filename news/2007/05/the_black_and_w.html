<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>
							In a new twist in American race relations, a federal court has ruled that a white teacher in a predominantly African-American school was subjected to a racially hostile workplace.
						</p>
						<p>
							The case concerned Elizabeth Kandrac, who was routinely verbally abused by black students at Brentwood Middle School in North Charleston. Their slurs make shock jock Don Imus look like a church deacon.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nevertheless, despite frequent complaints, school officials did nothing to intervene on Kandrac&rsquo;s behalf, arguing that the racially charged profanity was simply part of the students&rsquo; culture. If Kandrac couldn&rsquo;t handle cursing, school officials told her, she was in the wrong school.
						</p>
						<p>
							Kandrac finally filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and subsequently brought a lawsuit against the Charleston County School District, the school&rsquo;s principal and an associate superintendent. Last fall, jurors found that the school was a racially hostile environment to teach in and that the school district retaliated against Kandrac for complaining about it.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							Although Kandrac clearly suffered &mdash; she was suspended from her job shortly after a story about her EEOC complaint appeared in the local newspaper, and her contract was not renewed &mdash; her case didn&rsquo;t meet evidentiary requirements for damages. The judge said a new trial would have to determine damages, but the school district and Kandrac settled for $200,000.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							The key legal question was whether a school could be held responsible for students&rsquo; behavior. In this case, the black children of Brentwood had been given a pass for their behavior because vulgar language was considered normal for their culture.
						</p>
						<p>
							Defense attorney Alice Paylor told jurors that the kids heard this same language at home and there was &#8220;no magic pill&#8221; to make them behave. Paylor is probably right about that, though a magic paddle might have worked wonders.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							Let&rsquo;s be clear: What these children called this teacher is beyond reprehensible and could be only be construed as hostile and threatening. Here&rsquo;s a sample: white b&mdash;, white m&mdash; f&mdash;, white c&mdash;, white a&mdash;, white ho.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							Kandrac&rsquo;s attorney, Larry Kobrovsky, argued that the repeated use of &#8220;white&#8221; made these slurs racist in nature. But school officials insisted that because black students were equally abusive to other blacks, the language wasn&rsquo;t inherently racist.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here&rsquo;s what we know without question: If majority white students had used similar language toward black students and teachers, the case would have been plastered on the front page of The New York Times until heads rolled.
						</p>
						<p>
							A black Kandrac would have a million-dollar book deal, a movie contract and hundreds of interviews to juggle. Her oppressors and those who passively facilitated her abuse would have been pilloried by the media &mdash; their faces all over the evening news &mdash; while the reverends Al and Jesse organized protests.
						</p>
						<p>
							But a white Kandrac &mdash; who faced a daily barrage of insults, who had books and desks thrown at her and her bicycle tires punctured &mdash; was treated like an incompetent wimp. She was just a lousy teacher out for money, the defense attorney said.

							Brentwood Middle School Making A Difference

						<p>
							Elizabeth Kandrac, who is white, has settled out of court with the Charleston County School District. Kandrac was part of a three year legal battle claiming she was the victim of racial hostility at the predominantly black middle school in North Charleston.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							Principal Glears oversees the instruction of 450 students. Ninety-five percent are black, and the remaining five percent are white, Hispanic, or bi-racial.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							Former Brentwood Middle School Teacher Elizabeth Kandrac believes racial hostility was one concern.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;Kids who weren&rsquo;t even in my students would come into the classroom to yell obscenities at me, and curse at me. My own students would do the same thing,&#8221; said Elizabeth Kandrac.
						</p>
						<p>
							Kandrac says the students were out of control in every way.
