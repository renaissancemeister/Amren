<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/21/AR2007072101355.html">Muscling A Web Site Into A Social Movement</a></h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Miroff, Washington Post, July 22, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal immigrant ice cream vendors might be spreading leprosy in Manassas. Prince William County has been infiltrated by &#8220;unassimilated marxist radicals.&#8221; Manassas Park police covered up the predations of five Hispanic men who gang-raped a woman in the street in June.</p>
<p>These claims, among others, have been made in recent months by Greg Letiecq, whose popular blog, Black Velvet Bruce Li, offers &#8220;Blog-Fu for Prince William, Manassas and Manassas Park politics&#8221; &mdash; often making up in passion what it lacks in proof.</p>
<p>But Letiecq (pronounced LUH-teek) is not some mouse-pushing crackpot with a keyboard and an Internet connection. In the past 18 months, Letiecq has leveraged his blog to help elect allies, kill off opponents&rsquo; campaigns and shape local public policy. Peers call his site the most influential local blog in Virginia.</p>
<p>Since April, Letiecq has used his blog to sign up more than 500 members for his anti-illegal immigrant organization, Help Save Manassas, quickly building it into one of the region&rsquo;s most effective social movements. He and his group researched, facilitated and wrote parts of the illegal-immigration resolution that Prince William officials adopted this month, working with the Washington-based Immigration Reform Law Institute.</p>
<p>The resolution &mdash; approved unanimously July 10 &mdash; seeks to deny services to illegal immigrants and sharply increase immigration enforcement by police. Its sponsor, John T. Stirrup Jr. (R-Gainesville), is Letiecq&rsquo;s district representative and also a member of Help Save Manassas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His movement has tapped into a wellspring of simmering anger over illegal immigration and a general unease about the large influx of Hispanic residents who have moved to the region in the past decade, sparking suburban clashes over such quality-of-life issues as overcrowding, language, even lawn care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Letiecq isn&rsquo;t helping write county policy in Prince William, he can be found writing material of a different sort as Black Velvet Bruce Li. Among the ranks of the online martial artists who spin and strike across the so-called blogosphere, Letiecq is a virtual ninja, practicing character assassination, innuendo and exhortation with the skill of a black belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has by far the most well-trafficked local blog in the state and, as far as influencing public policy, one of the most influential blogs in the country,&#8221; said Ben Tribbett, whose Not Larry Sabato blog covers Virginia politics.</p>
<p>David Mastio, who tracks 200 Virginia political blogs on his Blognetnews.com, ranks Letiecq &#8220;the most influential conservative blogger in Northern Virginia&#8221; and among the top three most-influential political blogs in the state. Letiecq&rsquo;s site tallies about 47,000 distinct page views a day and counts 5,000 unique visitors, although he said he earns only about $1.50 a day from the operation because he doesn&rsquo;t have time to sell much advertising.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairfax County Harboring Illegal Aliens&#8221; was the title of a recent, and typical, Letiecq posting. Another warned &#8220;Zapatista Army Affiliate to Protest in PWC Today&#8221; &mdash; taking yet another swipe at a favorite target, the immigrant rights group Mexicans Without Borders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But to dismiss Black Velvet Bruce Li as the rantings of a fringe extremist underestimates Letiecq&rsquo;s reach and appeal. When he isn&rsquo;t fanning anti-illegal immigrant sentiment &mdash; and providing a venue for raw, sometimes bigoted views, on his comment pages &mdash; Letiecq reports on the minutiae of local news and politics to a degree no other media outlet has matched. Gossip, school board meetings, rumors, tax rate analysis &mdash; it&rsquo;s all there on his site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Letiecq&rsquo;s blog is also more media-savvy than most, using video, photos and snazzy graphics. The blog is widely praised for its playful humor, often at the expense of local officials, such as a &#8220;Ham Sandwich for Commonwealth&rsquo;s Attorney&#8221; campaign mocking Democratic incumbent Paul B. Ebert, or the constant referral to a Democratic House of Delegates candidate, Jeanette Rishell, as &#8220;moonfruit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, Letiecq would not say that the anti-illegal immigrant campaign began in his basement so much as on his lawn. From there, he points to his neighbor&rsquo;s house, emanating loud salsa music, where he believes two &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; are living. He doesn&rsquo;t have proof of this, of course, but pronounces his assumption as fact anyway.</p>
<p>Letiecq then points to a house two doors down, saying three families are living there with &#8220;six to eight&#8221; kids. He worries about crime, he said, and about his daughters, Lillian, 5, and Marian, 2, and whether public school resources are being diverted to English as a Second Language programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Letiecq isn&rsquo;t campaigning against illegal immigration, he savages local officials, media outlets (The Washington Post is a favorite target) and candidates who disagree with his views, unafraid to strike below the belt. A Democratic candidate for the Virginia General Assembly, Jeff Dion, withdrew his candidacy in May after Letiecq attacked Dion&rsquo;s &#8220;homosexual lifestyle&#8221; and revealed that Dion had a personal ad on a gay dating Web site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Democrats, illegal immigrants and homosexuals aren&rsquo;t Letiecq&rsquo;s only targets. He has also waged a withering offensive against Faisal Gill, a Republican naval officer and former Homeland Security official of Pakistani descent who is the first Muslim nominee to the Virginia General Assembly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Letiecq has repeatedly derided Gill as a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; because Gill once worked for a U.S. Muslim group whose former leader was convicted of having illegal ties to the Libyan government. Gill was cleared of any wrongdoing by Homeland Security investigators. He calls Letiecq&rsquo;s Web site &#8220;yellow journalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead, Letiecq said, he is like a 19th-century pamphleteer, advancing his views and urging others to action. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like clean, sanitized don&rsquo;t-upset-anybody kinds of discussions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We shouldn&rsquo;t pull our punches.&#8221;</p>
