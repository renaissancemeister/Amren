<h1>&lsquo;I Love My Mixed Race Baby &mdash; But Why Does She Feel So Alien?&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lowri Turner, London Daily Mail, July 12, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s getting very dark, isn&rsquo;t she?&#8221; This is what one of my friends recently said about my much adored &mdash; 12-week-old daughter.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude. But it was a comment that struck me with the force of a jab to the stomach.</p>
<p>Immediately, I was overwhelmed by a confusion of emotions. I felt protective, insulted, worried, ashamed, guilty, all at once. The reason? My lovely, wriggly, smiley baby is mixed race.</p>
<p>Now, I think of myself as pretty &lsquo;right on&rsquo;. My home is on the border of the London Republic of Hackney. I&rsquo;ve been to the Notting Hill Carnival, even if I found the music a bit loud. Yet now I realise what a &lsquo;white&rsquo; world I inhabit.</p>
<p>I am white and I have two sons from my first marriage who are both milky complexioned and golden haired. My twin sister, who I spend a lot of time with, has a Danish partner. As a consequence, she has two boys who are also pale skinned and flaxen haired.</p>
<p>Into this positively Scandinavian next generation, I have now injected a tiny, dark-skinned, dark-haired girl. To say she stands out is an understatement.</p>
<p>My colouring and that of my children has never really been an issue before. However, three years ago I met the man who became my second husband and who is the father of my daughter.</p>
<p>Although born in the UK, his parents came from India in the Sixties. This makes him British-Asian and our daughter mixed race.</p>
<p>There is another more PC term for the plump little bundle I strap to my front. She is &lsquo;dual heritage&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a bit trendy, but I quite like it. It implies a pride in coming from two cultures, rather than the less attractive connotations of &lsquo;mixed race&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The usual time something is labelled &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; is when it&rsquo;s a packet of nuts and they&rsquo;ve bulked out the luxury cashews with cheaper peanuts. I&rsquo;m not sure I want my daughter to be regarded as an adulterated version of some pure original. Still, it is the most accepted description.</p>
<p>The truth is, whatever the label, the fact there is a label proves that my daughter&rsquo;s conflicting parentage matters.</p>
<p>At the more frothy end of the scale, mixed-race children are regarded as pretty dolls &mdash; white kids with a nice tan.</p>
<p>When I was pregnant and people asked me about the child I was having, and I explained her father was Indian, they would often coo something along the lines of: &#8220;Ooh, she&rsquo;s going to be beautiful!&#8221; as if I was discussing a new rose, made from an exotic cross-breeding programme.</p>
<p>On a less benevolent level, mixed-race children can receive a hostile welcome from both white and black communities. Being neither one thing nor another may get you on the cover of Vogue, but it isn&rsquo;t an easy way to make friends.</p>
<p>But this is 2007, surely things are more enlightened than that? I hope so, but I fear not.</p>
<p>One reason for my fear is my own mixed reactions to my daughter. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love her. She is the child I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have after my first marriage broke up. She is the only granddaughter in our family and we all dote on her.</p>
<p>But when I turn to the mirror in my bedroom to admire us together, I am shocked. She seems so alien. With her long, dark eyelashes and shiny, dark brown hair, she doesn&rsquo;t look anything like me.</p>
<p>I know that concentrating on how my daughter looks is shallow. She is a person in her own right, not an accessory to me. But still, I can&rsquo;t shake off the feeling of unease.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise how much her looking different would matter and, on a rational level, I know it shouldn&rsquo;t. But it does.</p>
<p>Evolution demands that we have children to pass on our genes, hence the sense of pride and validation we get when we see our features reappearing in the next generation.</p>
<p>With my daughter, I don&rsquo;t have that. Do black fathers who marry white women and then have paler-skinned children feel my sense of loss? Or maybe Chinese mothers or Middle-Eastern grandparents grieve when they see a child they know to be their own, but whose features don&rsquo;t reflect that?</p>
<p>I worry that, as my daughter doesn&rsquo;t look like me, people will assume she is adopted. After all, it&rsquo;s all the rage in showbiz circles.</p>
<p>Madonna famously scooped up a black child when she wanted to be a mother again and Angelina Jolie appears to be assembling a &lsquo;pick &lsquo;n&rsquo; mix&rsquo; of kids from different countries. It&rsquo;s all very United Colours of Benetton, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>In the real world, I fear for my daughter&rsquo;s sense of self. She has a tiny foot in two cultures. How will she negotiate a path between the two? I worry that my sons will feel less of a kinship with their sister because she is different, although there is no sign of that.</p>
<p>As for myself, there is an inescapable status issue to address. White women who have non-white children are stigmatised as &lsquo;Tracy Towerblocks&rsquo; living on benefits, most of which they spend on lager and fags.</p>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t fit this profile, my daughter&rsquo;s difference definitely points out the fact that my children come from two different fathers.</p>
<p>If I wanted to pass us off as a nice, neat nuclear family, she would blow my cover at once.</p>
<p>But it is more than that. I am frightened, frightened of others&rsquo; reactions to her, as well as my own. I didn&rsquo;t think of myself as racist and yet my daughter has shown me a side of myself about which I feel deeply uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Even admitting to having mixed feelings about her not being blonde and blue eyed, I feel disloyal and incredibly guilty.</p>
<p>I know the obvious comment is that I must have known how a child of our union would look when I married an Indian man, but it is a wise woman who thinks that far ahead when she falls in love.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think about any of this before I got pregnant. I wanted to have a baby. Her colour and culture were immaterial then.</p>
<p>But self-flagellation is not useful. I have more pressing concerns. I am now the mother of a &lsquo;black&rsquo; child, even if she is more the hue of weak tea than espresso.</p>
<p>This is a role for which I am utterly unprepared. Part of me thinks I should be playing sitar music to her in her cot, mastering pakoras and serving them dressed in a sari, but that would be fantastically fake coming from me.</p>
<p>When she was born, pale but with lots of dark hair, I asked the midwife if her eyes would stay blue. &lsquo;Asian genes are very strong,&rsquo; she said in what I took to be an ominous tone.</p>
<p>No more Brady Bunch kids for me. The midwife has been proved right and every day my baby&rsquo;s eyes get a little darker.</p>
<p>Even so, when she looks up at me as I feed her, my heart melts. My love may not be colour blind, but hers is, and that is truly humbling.</p>
