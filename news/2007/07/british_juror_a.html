<h1>British Juror Arrested After Listening To Music Under Hijab</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, July 9, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman in her early 20s was spotted by a fellow juror listening to music as she was meant to be helping try the case of a pensioner accused of bludgeoning his wife to death after 50 years of marriage.</p>
<p>She could now be charged with contempt of court and, if convicted, may be punished with an indefinite jail sentence and an unlimited fine.</p>
<p>Details emerged after the defendant was convicted and Judge Roger Chapple lifted a reporting restriction which prevented previous publication of the details for fear of disrupting proceedings.</p>
<p>The woman had repeatedly arrived late for hearings at Blackfriars Crown Court, central London, and prosecuting lawyer Peter Clarke asked for her to be dismissed.</p>
<p>The judge initially refused, saying it was not necessary, but a day later, he received a note from another juror suggesting that the woman may have been listening to music during the defendant&rsquo;s evidence.</p>
<p>A Metropolitan Police spokesman said that police were called by a judge hearing a case at Blackfriars &#8220;regarding the inappropriate actions of a juror.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman was arrested for contempt of court on the direction of the judge,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Following the conclusion of the trial, the judge has requested that the matter be investigated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawyer Benn Maguire, a member of the team prosecuting the murder case, said: &#8220;It is unique for all those who are connected with this court to experience a situation where the juror is suspected of listening to a MP3 player under her Islamic headgear.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that he expected the woman would go to prison if she was charged and found guilty of contempt.</p>
