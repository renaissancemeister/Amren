<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>How would you feel about some new political parties on the Canadian landscape? What about a party created for the benefit of people of European descent, you know, something along the lines of, say The European Alliance Party? How about a party that wants to focus on issues of interest to Caucasians, such as the Caucasian People&rsquo;s Party? Or a party for British Protestants, such as the Orange Party? No? Well get ready for the inevitable outcome of state-sponsored multiculturalism as it moves toward the total balkanization of the Canada we once all knew and loved.</p>
<p>Recently a new political party was formed in British Columbia, called the National Alliance Party. Though the party&rsquo;s name is pretty innocuous its raison d&rsquo;etre is to bring a Chinese focus into the political scene. There are some 350,000 immigrants of Chinese origin in B.C. and the party&rsquo;s founder Wei Ping Chen wants to involve as many of them as he can in the political process in Canada. Wei laments the fact that many Chinese men are forced to return to Asia to work in order to support their families, as their qualifications and degrees are often not recognized by organizations granting accreditation in Canada.</p>
<p>While Wei&rsquo;s desire to involve Chinese immigrants in Canadian politics is laudable, the founding of a political party that focuses exclusively on the concerns of Chinese Canadians is not desirable, nor even acceptable.</p>
<p>With three or four (depends on where you live) major political parties in Canada already, forming a series of smaller parties that are exclusive to the concerns of certain ethnic, racial or other affinity groups is divisive and official Canadian values call that a no-no.</p>
<p>But then, official multiculturalism is by its very nature divisive, no matter how loudly its proponents proclaim that it is in fact inclusive. To be truly inclusive a culture would assimilate its immigrants and not ghettoize them into small &#8220;multicultural&#8221; enclaves.</p>
<p>The National Alliance Party is the first of its kind in Canada, but I predict not the last, as immigrants are realizing what multiculturalism really means. In Canada, as in Europe, Canadians are insisting that immigrants retain their respective cultures and are prepared to give up their indigenous Canadian Judeo-Christian culture to achieve that end. Consequently certain ethnic, cultural and religious groups are also beginning to realize the importance of having a political voice in Canada. Witness the wooing of Liberal politicians Maria Minna and Paul Martin by the Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils, which has been named by both CSIS and the US Department of Homeland Security as a Tamil Tiger front. Through its involvement with these politicians, the Tamil Tigers were able to continue its fundraising efforts in Canada to support a bloody and terror-filled revolt back in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The inevitable outcome of our policy of state-sponsored multiculturalism will be the establishment of more and more political parties or action groups that concern themselves with the narrow concerns unique to them.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that there will soon be a Canadian Islamic Party or a party that concerns itself solely with issues concerning people of colour. That&rsquo;s because despite our conceit that Canada is one of the most inclusive societies in the world, we are at heart a nation of closed and distant people.</p>
<p>The sentiments that fuel racism are indeed a two-way street, albeit some have argued idiotically that it is impossible for anyone but white people to be racist. Try walking through some of the ethnic ghettos in many of Canada&rsquo;s big cities; the resentment and mistrust displayed by many of our multicultural masses toward the rest of Canada is palpable. And for that reason it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before political parties that deal exclusively with narrow ethnic or racial concerns start spawning here like fish in the sea.</p>
