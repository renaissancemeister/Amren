<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8QKAAQ80&amp;show_article=1">Ill. Student Accused Of Terrorist Threat</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Suhr, AP, July 26, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He seemed in many ways a typical college student &mdash; president of his fraternity at Southern Illinois University, an aspiring rapper who wrote about finding a girlfriend who could cook. His said his favorite book was the Bible. But Olutosin Oduwole also had not-so-typical interests, like buying and selling guns on the Internet.</p>
<p>He allegedly sold a fully automatic M-16 assault rifle he never owned. And a court document says he was seen walking around campus wearing a bullet-resistant vest in May.</p>
<p>Then came the news this week: Police said they found a handwritten note inside his car threatening a &#8220;murderous rampage&#8221; similar to the one at Virginia Tech that left 32 people and the gunman dead.</p>
<p>On Wednesday &mdash; Oduwole&rsquo;s 22nd birthday &mdash; he pleaded not guilty to making a terrorist threat, a felony. He was being held Thursday on $1.1 million bail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That alleged plot was revealed, authorities say, on a piece of paper found inside Oduwole&rsquo;s car July 20. Rap lyrics were scrawled on one side of the sheet and part of the flipside, where authorities found the words that troubled them.</p>
<p>The note, police say, demanded payment to a PayPal account, threatening, &#8220;if this account doesn&rsquo;t reach $50,000 in the next seven days then a murderous rampage similar to the VT shooting will occur at another highly populated university. THIS IS NO JOKE.&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer suggested the shooting would target a &#8220;prestigious&#8221; university, but that word was crossed out. There was no direct mention of the 13,500-student Southern Illinois University in this city about 20 miles northeast of St. Louis.</p>
<p>At Oduwole&rsquo;s university apartment, police said they discovered a loaded gun and, according to a search warrant, a photograph of Oduwole flashing gang signs.</p>
<p>Oduwole was legally entitled to purchase the firearms, but federal authorities, with help from the dealer, intercepted the weapons.</p>
