<h1>A Tale Of Two Nations</h1>

				<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Western Critique, August 25. 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of all the nations in the world, The United States has remained a beacon of fascination to me since my student days. This trip was my seventh visit there since 1990. I chose to foray into the rural heartlands of Kentucky, and West Virginia, states I had never traversed before given they&rsquo;re off the beaten tourist track. I drove a snazzy Chrysler rental car, covering roughly 1500 miles in a loop that took me from Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Ohio and then back up to Michigan. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, aside from the basic similarities that bond the countries together, this essay will later suggest that the rate of decay in Britain is leaving it less similar to the sprit and character of America. As far as patriots are concerned, Britain and the US are rowing the same boat by enduring the transitional side effect pains to enforced multiculturalism. In Western Critiques opinion Britain is faring worse, mainly as it&rsquo;s smaller and densely populated. So after 5 years since my last visit I was keenly intrigued to see how England measured up to America. </p>
<p>Nationalists on both sides of the Atlantic pessimistically assert they&rsquo;re sinking ships. But despite whatever you read about another place, be it a city or country, it&rsquo;s best to visit the place in person to experience it yourself. Usually you can&rsquo;t beat first hand observation. </p>
<p>Throughout this part of the USA I observed the majority of Americans to be civilised and orderly. Not a new observation given it was my seventh visit. It just reinforced the more favourable perceptions of my previous visits, not all of which were necessarily as uplifting. Almost everyone was assertive and emotionally mature. There were <br>
fewer anti-social miscreants about and less litter in the streets of nearly everywhere I went.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a couple of outlets a young lady serving behind the counter sweetly remarked &lsquo;I like his accent&rsquo; to her colleagues. The general reception was positive, which I partly attributed to the fact that I travelled through rural areas where locals were unaccustomed to hearing an English accent. I must admit that I fancied some of the delightful chicks working behind the counters. Moreover, I don&rsquo;t recall any women in America on this trip who turned me off. They&rsquo;re definitely one of Americas greatest assets. In general they tend to outshine English women in beauty and femininity, and I have not found them to be as stuck up, negative or spiteful by comparison.</p>
<p>My only slight criticism of interpersonal interaction in the States was the tendency to keep verbal transactions terse and to the point. I would have preferred a slightly more laid back, chatty demeanour, though obviously not too laid back where manners and etiquette are lowered. I noticed that conversations were initiated mainly for functional purposes rather than casual relaxed banter. It might be influenced by the fast paced nature of American life where time is money and there&rsquo;s no time to waste. Still, I felt more affinity with the mindset and attitude of most Americans than the prevailing attitude in not so merry England. This was a nation that I readily identified with, and one where I feel I would fit in well. I had the impression that if you made an effort you would get somewhere. </p>
<p>I respected the style of social co-operation without the herd like, cliquey behaviour so pervasive in England. This was apparent in the way people associated with each other in public. You might see groups of youths together occasionally, but unlike Britain you don&rsquo;t encounter so many unfriendly teenage gangs loitering around, unless you unwisely or unwittingly strayed into the no go inner city areas. That&rsquo;s also partly due to the fact that there is a higher level of individualism in America, whereas Britain is all about fitting into a group or clique. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During reflections on the trip I was often preoccupied with how different America was from the motherland that principally gave birth to it  &mdash;  different in the social sense I mean. The English playwright George Bernard Shaw once said England and America are two nations divided by a common language. That may have been apparent in Shaw&rsquo;s day, but in my opinion the differences in language and even its usage are relatively trivial compared to the behavioural differences. It&rsquo;s more appropriate to say that England and America are two nations divided by a different psychology. The psychology of America was fresh and healthy to begin it with since many of the early settlers were religious zealots who were seeking greater freedom than they had in England. Ironically, there has not been much improvement three centuries later. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I can only grimly conclude that since the 17th century, the Anglo-Saxon gene pool in England has degraded in eugenic quality, whereas in America they practiced sensible reproductive preferences, even if they weren&rsquo;t consciously aware of it. There is no clear reason as to why this happened. One idea I have contemplated is that the rigid class system in England meant that the individuals with the most blessed genetic inheritance in the upper classes bore few children. </p>
<p>You can find variable quality of people in all socio-economic classes, but it still seems that the upper middle classes are the best behaved, and quite often attractive. Of course people should always be judged by their behaviour rather than by financial status. I&rsquo;m not keen on petty snobbery, though I do prefer people to select suitable compatible partners. Furthermore, in America the European immigrants were not interested in recreating the exclusive class structure in Britain that persisted to the present day. That is not to say there are no divisions in America amongst citizens even of the same ethnicity: approximately 38 million people live at or below the poverty line in America, which represents about 9% of the estimated 300 million population, excluding the illegal alien population.</p>
<p>An acquaintance I know also raised another worthy point. The two calamitous wars better known as World War I and II claimed the lives of some of the best of the British. By contrast, as America was a nation born of idealism with serious, conservative values towards work, morality and drinking, people naturally chose partners who were right for them. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For its part, England has enjoyed its high points and has struggled through adversity before. Its idealistic era probably culminated in the Victorian age of the late 19th century when the British Empire reached its peak. Since then it has assumed a downward descent, with egalitarianism and political correctness in the late 20th century supplanting the adventurous scientific ethos of the Victorian heyday. And the change is not confined to a loss of pride and prestige, but also the behaviour of the people themselves. Years ago in America there once existed a perception of the typical Englishman as a dignified and proud gentleman. Maybe the upper middle class English garnered more attention in the old days. </p>
<p>Now the average young Englishman today is likely to be a mindless, unprincipled lout. The sort you see driving a fast car blaring out loud music with an aggressive apathetic attitude. And as for individualism and true character, forget it. Regrettably the majority of the English subscribe to a herd mentality that expresses itself vulgarly in the ubiquitous anti-social teenage yob gangs that are a stain on public life. It is accurate to say now that the communities I saw in America are saner and more pleasant than many towns in England. I also like the way that Americans have preserved customs and mannerisms since the 17th century.</p>
<p>Both Britain and the USA have adopted politically correct trends since the 1990s. While America is seen as the birthplace of political correctness, Britain is much further down the insidious road of authoritarian PC dogmatism. Although large global corporations have pushed anti-white agendas by grossly over-representing ethnic minorities in consumer adverts, I was pleased to discover that the majority of roadside billboard adverts in the states I travelled through featured attractive white men and women together, particularly blonde women I may add. </p>
<p>Over in Britain, natural wholesome coupling of whites is less commonplace. There&rsquo;s absolutely no excuse for this stance, as ethnic minorities still do not constitute more than 15% of the UK population, even though their population is rising at a faster rate. </p>
<p>Likewise government ads/booklets now feature more ethnic minorities than indigenous white British, not a coincidence either. It&rsquo;s part of the self-hating madness of modern Britain. I attribute the refreshing ads I saw in rural America to be the fact that not only were the areas still majority white, but also that they were put up by local companies. In other words, the inclination of people in those areas is to display model citizens representative of their community, rather than the nefarious multi-national organisations who promote hatred of whites by exclusion. Political correctness and anti-white themes therefore are only the machinations of a small minority in the upper strata of society. They wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if ordinary people weren&rsquo;t susceptible to the messages conveyed in them. As Britain is a small country there is not much scale for independent large scale advertising.</p>
<p>When I was eating breakfast in a McDonalds in a small Ohio Town, I picked up a local newspaper for a quick read. I noticed a 1940s/50s era photo of four local adults, including a couple of women. I can&rsquo;t remember what the article was about. I think it was honouring some local society celebrating an anniversary. But the story was significant in that it reminded me of a similar photo I&rsquo;ve seen in England around about that time. The hairstyles and attire of the people in the photo, as well as their appearance, could have well have been taken in England. But it occurred to me that England has gone downhill so far in tastes, manners, civility, human quality, and behaviour that the two countries are much less similar to each other than they were in mid 20th century after the war. Whereas the Ohio town I visited seemed to have retained its essential character, a comparably sized town in England is coarser than it was just ten years ago. </p>
<p>For the first time on finishing a holiday I didn&rsquo;t relish coming back home. I suppose I saw myself as would be 21st century pilgrim, though on this occasion I was strictly visiting on a I-94 tourist visa waiver. Emigrating to the states incidentally is not easy as many might assume &mdash; Britain is not a country eligible for the Green Card Diversity lottery where 50,000 lucky applicants are selected to win a four-year residency/work permit. Still we all have our dreams. </p>
<p>Settling in the States may take time to adjust at first, but I&rsquo;m convinced the healthy aspects of the culture would lead to contentment in the long run. Upon landing at Gatwick the differences between the two countries were quite palpable. </p>
<p>As I walked out to the arrivals concourse I couldn&rsquo;t help notice listless and unhappy people everywhere, and there seemed to be a stale tatty atmosphere. I eventually reacclimatised myself, but the first day was hard. It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. Like many people in their thirties or older I fondly recall a genteel England of yesteryear which you could be proud of.</p>
<p>Although America may be enduring the bane of large scale immigration into its cities &mdash; both legal and illegal &mdash; I stand to the conviction that the nation is fundamentally a white country in its soul, as epitomised in the small towns. And although it has included a multicultural dimension to its character for some time it still retains an underlying bedrock of European culture as its core foundation. Oh America, please refrain from going as far as Britain on the degenerate path to a stale, mediocre society where white freshness and beauty is being extinguished. Preserve what makes you great. Those small towns were pleasing and tranquil; I shudder to think how they could be spoiled. </p>
