						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the heart of this tale is the procrustean effort by Hispanic activists to impose the black civil rights paradigm on their undocumented amigos. To do this, however, they need black support, and that is slipping away.</p>
<p>Here is how the effort plays out in an overly sensitive town like Kansas City. Earlier this summer, new mayor Mark Funkhouser, a maverick Democrat, picked an Hispanic guy to chair the traditionally blue-blooded Park Board.</p>
<p>Funkhouser, in fact, turned the Park Board into a veritable Mod Squad, adding an eccentric ex-councilwoman, a guy who wants reparations for slavery, a suburban rose-growing grandma, and a black male ballet dancer.</p>
<p>Hispanic activists and their fellow travelers, black and white, were not satisfied with just the chair. They insisted on a board that while &#8220;looking like America&#8221; thought exactly as they did. And one of Funkhouser&rsquo;s picks clearly did not.</p>
<p>Yes, the grandma! To embarrass Funkhouser, an old line Dem rival had ratted out the 73 year-old Frances Semler as a card-carrying member of the not-so-secret organization known as the Minutemen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Councilwoman Beth Gottstein] and her council cronies promptly voted 9-2 to condemn Semler and wish her gone. To his credit, Funkhouser ignored them.</p>
<p>On August 4 th, just a few days after I wrapped up my annual week at the Jersey Shore &mdash; Seaside Park to be precise &mdash; my attention was forced back to New Jersey. All of America&rsquo;s was.</p>
<p>Some unknown killers in Newark had lined up four promising, college-bound black kids, two of them girls. They sexually assaulted the girls, sliced at least one of them with a machete, and put a bullet in the back of all four of the kids&rsquo; heads. Three died.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, so effective have the LA media been in suppressing stories of brown on black violence, now epidemic in schools and prisons, that It was not until early 2007 that one such story escaped their grasp.</p>
<p>What prompted national attention was not so much the murder of 14-year-old Cheryl Green by Hispanic gang members in LA&rsquo;s volatile Harbor Gateway neighborhood, but the killing&rsquo;s gratuitous nature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the New York area, however, the politicos and their media allies are still a little naïve. They did not hesitate to beat their breasts loudly about the multiple killings in Newark, still one more seeming injustice in a city plagued by the same.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When it turned out that the chief suspect was an illegal alien from Peru and his partner-in-mayhem a Nicaraguan whose green card should have been revoked for an earlier crime, it was too late to put this undocumented genie back in the ink bottle.</p>
<p>The truth silenced the amnesty crowd just about everywhere but Kansas City. Here, incredibly, our Cesar Chavez wannabes continued to fret more about a law-abiding grandma than a gang of machete-wielding illegals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This time, as the Star reported last week, &#8220;The nation&rsquo;s largest Hispanic rights group is warning it may cancel its 2009 convention here because of a controversial Kansas City park board member.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;rights group&#8221; in question is <i>La Raza,</i> Spanish for &#8220;the race.&#8221; Whatever that race is, it is certainly not black, and black leaders are beginning to understand that.</p>
<p>Based much more on hope than evidence, the Star reported that the NAACP might also change its convention plans because of Semler.</p>
<p>The reporter had to concede, however, that she had talked to no one at the NAACP and that &#8220;national and local NAACP officials did not return telephone calls Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt, Democratic bosses are leaning on black leaders to pacify the base and keep the coalition together. The base, however, has a mind of its own, and, as black leaders know, it ain&rsquo;t pacified at all.</p>
