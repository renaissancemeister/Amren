<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Lionel Sosa has long been one of the Republicans&rsquo; most potent weapons come election time. A Hispanic marketing guru, he&rsquo;s crafted successful ad campaigns for presidential candidates from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush aimed at drawing more Latinos into the GOP fold. So his presidential pick this time &mdash; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat &mdash; is startling. Part of the reason, he says, is ethnic loyalty: Richardson is the first serious Latino contender. But Sosa, who last worked for Bush in 2004, has also been dismayed by the way many GOP candidates have handled the illegal-immigration issue, advocating policies like building a border wall and employing rhetoric that he says is venomous and xenophobic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That stance appears to be the root cause of a Hispanic migration from the GOP. In 2004, Bush got about 40 percent of that bloc &mdash; a high that largely resulted from an intense courtship by Bush and the now departed strategist Karl Rove. Yet in the 2006 midterms &mdash; held after a caustic immigration debate in Congress &mdash; GOP candidates got only 30 percent of that vote. Polls this year show Latino support for Republicans at similarly depressed levels. That doesn&rsquo;t bode well for the party, since Hispanic registered voters should hit 11.4 million in &lsquo;08, compared with 7.5 million in &lsquo;00, according to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO). Moreover, they live in swing states like Nevada, New Mexico and Florida, where they could determine an outcome. &ldquo;I am worried,&rdquo; Rove told reporters after leaving the White House in August. &ldquo;You cannot ignore the aspirations of the fastest-growing minority in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet that appears to be what the GOP is doing. Unlike the Democrats, all the Republican presidential candidates, except Sen. John McCain, declined to participate in a debate on the Spanish-language channel Univision, possibly to avoid hostile immigration questioning (the network says it&rsquo;s trying to reschedule). They also ditched conventions earlier this year held by high-profile groups like the National Council of La Raza and NALEO. The Republican National Committee has yet to fill a Hispanic-outreach job vacated last November. &ldquo;The RNC seems to have just given up,&rdquo; says Samuel Bettencourt, a Hispanic Republican who has handled outreach for nonprofits. (An RNC spokesperson says Sen. Mel Martinez, the committee&rsquo;s Latino chair, is committed to courting Hispanics. Martinez was unavailable for comment.) Recently, Bettencourt found further cause for gloom: a job he&rsquo;d been offered this summer as executive director of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, a prominent grass-roots group, fell through when the incoming board told him it lacked sufficient funds to pay him. &ldquo;They have no staff, no office &hellip; [and] were even talking about closing,&rdquo; says Bettencourt. (The RNHA&rsquo;s new chairman, Danny Vargas, says the group will remain operative and is developing fund-raising plans.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite these sentiments, some argue the GOP will recover. Once the primary elections are over, the nominee will &ldquo;take a much more focused approach in reaching out&rdquo; to Hispanics, says Rafael Bejar, former director of Hispanic coalitions at the RNC. Already, two of the GOP candidates earn more favorable marks than their Republican peers among Latino politicos: Mitt Romney, who&rsquo;s got an energetic outreach effort led by Al Cardenas, the former chair of the Florida Republican Party; and McCain, who championed immigration reform in the Senate. It will be up to them to undo any damage their party has done.<br>
