<h1>SPLC Stalinists Strike Again, Stupidly</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, Vdare.com, September 13, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>
	You would think an organization with nearly $200 million in the bank and a budget of close to $30 million (according to its filings with the federal government) could do something right. 
</p>
<p>
	But not the <a href="http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=%22southern+Poverty+Law+Center%22&amp;sp-a=sp0a298a00&amp;sp-advanced=1&amp;sp-p=all&amp;sp-w-control=1&amp;sp-w=alike&amp;sp-d=custom&amp;sp-date-range=-1&amp;sp-start-month=0&amp;sp-start-day=0&amp;sp-start-year=&amp;sp-end-month=0&amp;sp-end-day=0&amp;sp-end-year=&amp;sp"> Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC). 
</p>
<p>
	On August 21, commentator  Patrick Buchanan quoted a few statistics from my New Century Foundation study, <i><a href="/newstore/cart_page_color_of_crime.html"> The Color of Crime</a></i><b>,</b> in his syndicated column posted <a href="http://buchanan.org/blog/?p=826"> on his website</a>, on VDARE.COM <b></b> and  elsewhere. He noted, for example, that blacks commit more  violent crime against whites than against blacks, and that they are seven times more likely than other Americans to commit murder. 
</p>
<p>
	This is just the sort of thing the SPLC doesn&rsquo;t want you to know. One of its writers, named Heidi Beirich, went right to work, trying to keep anyone else from<a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams081899.asp"> quoting </a><i>The Color of Crime</i> ever again. 
</p>
<p>
	Did she try to prove that blacks do <i>not</i> commit more violent crime against whites than blacks? 
</p>
<p>
	Or that they are <i>not</i> more likely than other groups to commit murder? 
</p>
<p>
	Of course not; the facts, all from government sources, can&rsquo;t be refuted. Instead she screamed that the New Century Foundation is <b>&quot;white supremacist,&quot;</b> and that our publications and research are racist, racist, racist, racist. (She can&rsquo;t say that often enough  &mdash;  she used it, on average, every 85th word.) 
</p>
<p>
	Just how racist are we? Miss Beirich cites our publication, <i>American Renaissance</i>: <b>&ldquo;A 2002 article, for instance, argued that blacks are inherently pathological, suffering from a &lsquo;personality disorder of which the central feature is lack of a moral sense.&rsquo;&rdquo;</b> [<i><a href="http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2007/08/22/pat-buchanan-again-cites-racist-sources-on-black-crime/">Pat Buchanan Again Cites Racist Sources on Black Crime</a>,</i> August 22, 2007] 
</p>
<p>
	What did <i>American Renaissance</i> actually say? The complete sentence  &mdash;  written by <a href="http://www.rlynn.co.uk/">Prof. Richard Lynn</a>, emeritus of the University of Ulster at Coleraine  &mdash;  was not about blacks at all: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<b>&quot;Psychopathic personality is a personality disorder of which the central feature is lack of a moral sense.&quot;</b>[<i><a href="/ar/2002/07/index.html#cover">Race and Psychopathic Personality</a>: Racial differences in &ldquo;average personality,&rdquo;</i> <i>American Renaissance,</i> July 2002]. 
</blockquote>
<p>
	Lynn then pointed out that, in the 65 years since the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) has been in use, blacks have consistently scored higher than whites on psychopathic personality, while  Asians have scored lower. 
</p>
<p>
	These are the scientific facts Miss Beirich twisted to make it sound as if Prof. Lynn thinks all blacks are <b>&quot;inherently pathological.&quot;</b> 
</p>
<p>
	No wonder her article included live Internet links to other sources, <i>but not to Prof. Lynn</i>. She wouldn&rsquo;t want her readers to know what he really said. 
</p>
<p>
	Even more extraordinary was Miss Beirich&rsquo;s attempt to explain how <i>The Color of Crime </i>got things wrong. An article in the SPLC&rsquo;s very own <i>Intelligence Report,</i> she claimed, soundly refuted it. But the article is seven years old. [<i>SPLCenter.org: Coloring Crime,</i> <i>Intelligence Report</i> Summer 2000] Our research was published in 2005  &mdash;  barely two years ago. Even with $30 million a year you can&rsquo;t refute studies that have not yet been written. 
</p>
<p>
	(Miss Beirich was referring to our earlier report, from 1999 [<a href="/colorofcrime/color.pdf">PDF</a>], which the SPLC tried to refute by asserting, wrongly, that poverty was a more significant correlation.) 
</p>
<p>
	Miss Beirich went on with the SPLC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6989">usual hash </a> of distortion,  smear, and guilt-by-association  &mdash;  throwing in <b>&quot;racist&quot;</b> every 85 words  &mdash;  as she tried to scare Mr. Buchanan away from facts she doesn&rsquo;t want Americans to hear. 
</p>
<p>
	That won&rsquo;t work, of course, because  Mr. Buchanan cares about the truth, not about the SPLC&rsquo;s dishonest yapping. 
</p>
<p>
	Miss Beirich clearly hopes that others may not be made of the same stuff as Mr. Buchanan  &mdash;  that they <i>will </i>be scared off at the possibility she might blast them with her favorite word. 
</p>
<p>
	For that is the SPLC&rsquo;s mission: suppress facts, shout down opponents, stamp out dissent, demonize anyone who disagrees. 
</p>
<p>
	Stalin was good at this. So was Mao. 
</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s what people do when they have neither facts, morals nor  &mdash;  despite the <i>Intelligence Report&rsquo;s</i> title &hellip; intelligence.
