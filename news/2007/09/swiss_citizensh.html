<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6992670.stm">Swiss Citizenship System &lsquo;Racist&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, September 13, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An official report into the process of naturalisation in Switzerland says the current system is discriminatory and in many respects racist. </p>
<p>The report, from Switzerland&rsquo;s Federal Commission on Racial Discrimination, recommends far-reaching changes. </p>
<p>It criticises the practice of allowing members of a community to vote on an individual&rsquo;s citizenship application. </p>
<p>Muslims and people from the Balkans and Africa are the most likely to be rejected, the report points out. </p>
<p>Switzerland has Europe&rsquo;s toughest naturalisation laws. Foreigners must live for 12 years in a Swiss community before they can apply, and being born in Switzerland brings no right to citizenship. </p>
<p>Under the current system, foreigners apply through their local town or village. </p>
<p>They appear before a citizenship committee and answer questions about their desire to be Swiss. After that, they must often be approved by the entire voting community, in a secret ballot, or a show of hands. This practice, the report says, is particularly likely to be distorted by racial discrimination. </p>
<p>It cites the case of a disabled man originally from Kosovo. Although fulfilling all the legal criteria, his application for citizenship was rejected by his community on the grounds that his disability made him a burden on taxpayers, and that he was Muslim. </p>
<p>The report recommends that decisions on citizenship should be decided by an elected executive and not by the community as a whole. But such a move is likely to encounter stiff opposition. </p>
<p>Foreigners are a key issue in the run-up to Switzerland&rsquo;s general election next month. </p>
<p>The right-wing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party, currently leading in the opinion polls, claims Swiss communities have a democratic right to decide who can or cannot be Swiss. </p>
