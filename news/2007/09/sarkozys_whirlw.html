			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Celestine Bohlen, Bloomberg.com, September 24, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Celestin Banya&rsquo;s apartment in the grim, crowded Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois was burglarized three times in one week this summer. The last time, he waited three hours for the police to arrive. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We have cowardly police who are afraid of everyone and do nothing,&rdquo; says Banya, 48, a construction worker who came to France from Zaire about three decades ago. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been two years since angry black and Arab youths went on a rampage in this town of 29,000, igniting riots that spread across France. There&rsquo;s still no sign of the police station then- President Jacques Chirac promised in 2005. </p>
<p>Now France has a new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, 52, who promised to better integrate disaffected minorities. While he&rsquo;s off to a flying start on several fronts &mdash; pushing changes in taxes and pensions, seeking a new treaty for the European Union, attending his first United Nations general session this week &mdash; his whirlwind approach after four months in office hasn&rsquo;t reached Clichy-sous-Bois. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Claude Dilain, the Socialist mayor of Clichy-sous-Bois, says there&rsquo;s an invisible barrier that keeps France&rsquo;s poor, immigrant communities in densely packed suburbs known as &ldquo;banlieues&rdquo; out of sight and out of mind. He calls it the Maginot Line, referring to the French defense that collapsed under German attack in 1940. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard one single statement about the &lsquo;banlieue&rsquo; from our new president?&rdquo; Dilain asks. &ldquo;Neither have I.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Minority Appointments </p>
<p>On France&rsquo;s troubled suburbs and the integration of minorities, Sarkozy&rsquo;s initiative has been to appoint people of immigrant backgrounds to high-profile positions. </p>
<p>Rachida Dati, 41, daughter of North African immigrants, is minister of justice. Senegalese-born Rama Yade, 30, is secretary of state for human rights. </p>
<p>Fadela Amara, whose parents are Algerian, is secretary of state for urban affairs. Sarkozy has charged her with devising a plan for all issues related to low-income projects. Presentation of the results will include a conference chaired by the president at a date not yet determined, says Julia Pronzato, a spokeswoman for Amara. </p>
<p>Sitting in his office just blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, Chenva Tieu, a 43-year-old entrepreneur who came to France from Cambodia in 1975, says the appointments will have an impact. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The kids in the banlieue need symbols,&rdquo; says Tieu, co- founder of the 21st Century Club, a group of young professionals of immigrant origin committed to promoting diversity. &ldquo;They feel excluded from France socially, economically and politically. They don&rsquo;t speak perfect French. They don&rsquo;t have the codes to Paris society. They need to see diversity at the top.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Beyond Symbols </p>
<p>Still, he says, Sarkozy must move beyond symbols if he is to win the confidence of new citizens: &ldquo;If I see nothing else by January, I will be disappointed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>(snip}</p>
<p>Mayor since 1995, Dilain, 58, dismisses the new faces as &ldquo;pure casting,&rdquo; or window dressing that camouflages the absence of a real policy. He has been assured a police station by 2009. He is less sure about money promised to tear down La Forestiere and replace it with 1,700 new housing units. </p>
<p>Rising Crime </p>
<p>Dilain says crime is up in Clichy-sous-Bois. In Seine- Saint-Denis, where the town is located, crimes against people, including assault and rape, jumped 8.3 percent in the year ended July 31, compared with a 2.5 percent rise nationally and a 2.2 percent drop in Paris, according to the Observatoire National de la Delinquance, a crime-statistics agency. </p>
<p>The number of property-related crimes in Seine-Saint-Denis per 1,000 inhabitants was 71.7, compared with 40.5 nationwide. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our situation is difficult and deteriorating,&rdquo; Dilain says. &ldquo;I have a feeling of being abandoned by the police. When they call, our residents are told, &lsquo;The car isn&rsquo;t there,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Manage it yourselves,&rsquo; or simply, &lsquo;Clichy-sous-Bois? You are not our priority.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
<p>Recent clashes in central Paris between bands of youths from the suburbs &mdash; including one last month at Pigalle, a block from the Moulin Rouge cabaret &mdash; have raised alarms about Los Angeles-style gangs emerging in France. Dilain says they could be a wake-up call for a society that has yet to absorb the lessons of 2005. </p>
