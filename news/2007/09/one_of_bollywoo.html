			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Naresh Puri, BBC News, September 25, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 40-second advertisement from India starts like so many others promoting razors or hair dye &mdash; but it&rsquo;s an ad with a very big difference. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a man who has no luck with the girls. He has markedly darker skin than his friends and the girl he is after. In a real song-and-dance Bollywood extravaganza, one of the biggest heart throbs of Indian cinema, Shahrukh Khan, hands over a cream to the hapless chap, along with some mild admonishment. Withing a few weeks, the young</p>
<p>man has turned much lighter-skinned and confident. As he strides down the road like a modern-day answer to John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, the girls start flocking to him and chanting: &ldquo;Hi handsome, hi handsome.&rdquo; Khan comes back into view with the product, Fair and Handsome. </p>
<p>The skin-lightening cream for men, along with its more feminine counterparts, has found its way into Asian supermarkets and stores in the UK. </p>
<p>While Khan&rsquo;s advert has not been shown yet in the UK, it too has made its way to British consumers via YouTube. And the product&rsquo;s success or failure in the British market place may say something about the nature of beauty and the politics of race. </p>
<p>Kiran Kaur &mdash; a Sikh human rights activist in west London, one of the epicentres of Asian cultural life in the UK &mdash; says the arrival of Fair and Handsome, with a Bollywood name in tow, is a step back in time. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Age-old prejudices&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The ad simply reinforces the idea that you&rsquo;ve got to be fair to be anything in life,&rdquo; says Kiran. &ldquo;It says that if you&rsquo;re fair and good looking, you&rsquo;ll be a wonderful daughter-in-law or husband, your skin colour determines how successful you&rsquo;ll be in life. The ad reinforces age-old prejudices.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The skin-lightening industry is worth at least Â£100m in India and the Fair-and-Handsome-for-Men range is the latest product from one of the market&rsquo;s big players.</p>
<p>But what chance do voices like Rani&rsquo;s stand against the screen presence of Shahrukh Khan? Perhaps the best measure of Khan&rsquo;s influence on British Asians is to look at the success of his films. </p>
<p>Dil Se, released in 1998, was the first Bollywood movie to make it into the British box office Top 10. </p>
<p>The film&rsquo;s key clips, including an exhilarating dance upon a moving train, have totted up more than one million hits on YouTube. Khan, a big enough brand to be known just as SRK, is the equivalent of Tom Cruise &mdash; and then some. </p>
<p>His Fair-and-Handsome advert won&rsquo;t be missed by British Asians as they follow every Bollywood move, says Sunny Hundal, the editor of Asians in Media, a website that charts the rise of British Asian culture. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Immoral&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Shahrukh Khan is a huge star in India and his endorsement will no doubt raise the profile of this product,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Impressionable young men will get the idea that if they want to be attractive like him, they should also use it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The cult of media personality, especially cricket or Bollywood stars, is a much bigger phenomena in India and so brands are much more partial to celebrity endorsements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what SRK is essentially doing is confirming and promoting the condescending attitude that many Indians have towards dark-coloured skin. His endorsement is completely immoral.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Neither the manufacturers nor a spokesman for Khan would comment on his involvement in the campaign. </p>
<p>But Manish Shah, a distributor for Fair and Handsome says skin lightening creams are very important because &ldquo;everybody wants to look really good&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not bad for the skin,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If people have an inferiority complex because of their skin colour, then this product will really help. It does what it says. It makes you fair and handsome. There&rsquo;s a lot of interest in this product and quite simply it makes people look really good.&rdquo; </p>
