						<p>Phoenix police Officer Nick Erfle survived two bouts of cancer to put back on his uniform and patrol the city&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a jaywalker shot him in the face and killed him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gunman, an illegal immigrant who had been deported last year, fled after shooting Erfle, commandeering a stopped car at gunpoint and ordering the motorist to drive. About an hour later, a Phoenix police tactical team surrounded Erik Jovani Martinez, 22, on a west Phoenix street and shot him dead as he pointed a gun at the hostage. The hostage was not hurt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Erfle was the second Phoenix police officer killed since July and the third Valley officer killed this year. He was married with two children and had a large extended family.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another tragic day for the citizens of Phoenix. We have lost one of our family,&#8221; said Dave Siebert, the city&rsquo;s vice mayor. &#8220;This has happened way too many times in the city of Phoenix&hellip; . He was one of our finest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martinez, who had three children, was a gang member with a history of drug abuse, police say. He was convicted of theft in 2004 and served a short stint in prison in 2006. Immigration officials confirmed he had been deported in March 2006.<br>
A deadly morning<br>
Police say Erfle, 33, and Officer Rob Rodarme were patrolling in a two-man car around 8:30 a.m. Tuesday when they saw three people jaywalking across 24th Street near Pinchot Avenue, interfering with traffic. </p>
<p>The two officers stopped the three, a man and two women, on Pinchot to talk to them and asked for identification. Police rarely issue citations for jaywalking, telling people instead to just cross at a safer spot in the future, Tranter said.</p>
<p>The man didn&rsquo;t have identification but gave officers a name and birth date that Erfle ran through a police computer. That search turned up a misdemeanor warrant for shoplifting out of Tucson. </p>
<p>Police would later find out the man hadn&rsquo;t given his real name. Martinez likely used an alias because he was trying to hide the fact he had felony warrants for aggravated assault and false imprisonment, stemming from a 2006 domestic-violence incident. </p>
<p>But the officers didn&rsquo;t know any of that and tried to arrest him on the misdemeanor warrant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Martinez shoved Erfle to the ground, pulled a gun and fired multiple times. Police said it all happened in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was three shots, and there was a pause, and then one more shot,&#8221; said Bob Newnum, who lives nearby. </p>
<p>Rodarme ran after the fleeing suspect but couldn&rsquo;t return fire because the area was too crowded, Tranter said.</p>
<p>Police flooded into the area. Newnum said Erfle&rsquo;s body was facedown across a sidewalk, with his feet partly in the street. His partner was kneeling over Erfle, cursing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my God, there was just blood all over the place,&#8221; Elliott said. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t even describe it. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no movement at all&hellip; . I&rsquo;m sure he was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott said it took three officers to pull Rodarme away from his partner. Paramedics pumped on Erfle&rsquo;s chest before whisking him away in an ambulance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just a feeling I will never, ever forget,&#8221; Elliott said. &#8220;I just cannot believe it&hellip; . It&rsquo;s such a stupid thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the shooting, the assailant ran to the intersection of 24th Street and Thomas Road, where he carjacked the sedan. Witnesses were able to give police a description of the vehicle and a license plate. </p>
<p>One hour later, a tactical officer in an unmarked car spotted the stolen vehicle with a passenger matching the suspect&rsquo;s description. Officers began a covert surveillance of the vehicle and managed to box it in near 27th Avenue and McDowell Road. </p>
<p>The suspect raised his gun to the hostage, and an officer fired through a window once, killing him, Detective Bob Ragsdale said. </p>
<p>{snip}<br>
A life cut short<br>
Erfle had been an officer for eight years. He was pronounced dead at 9:30 a.m. </p>
<p>In Erfle&rsquo;s north Phoenix neighborhood Tuesday night, Tiana Iannuzzi, 17, tearfully remembered the officer as a playful and patient family man who never raised his voice. Iannuzzi baby-sat for Erfle&rsquo;s two sons, ages 3 and 5, and said the officer was &#8220;a great guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Erfle had twice battled testicular cancer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He and his wife were still making the plans all young couples make,&#8221; Gordon said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her eyes welled when she heard Erfle had been killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sorry for his family,&#8221; said Roper, whose son-in-law is a Chandler police officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;They work so hard, and their life is always on the line,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just very sad. Very, very sad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gary Dubay watched the aftermath from the parking lot of Phoenix Bicycle, where he works.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how to react to something like that,&#8221; Dubay said. &#8220;He was just stopping those people, and all of a sudden that breaks out. It&rsquo;s pretty crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A series of tragedies</p>
<p>This has been a particularly violent year for Valley police officers.</p>
<p>Glendale police Officer Anthony Holly was shot and killed during a traffic stop in February. Phoenix police Officer George Cortez Jr. was killed in July after responding to a call about a bad check.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
 <br>
&#8220;You can contact someone for anything, a speeding ticket, jaywalking, walking down the sidewalk. What initially may be perceived as a simple contact, you could be dealing with a dangerous suspect.&#8221;</p>
