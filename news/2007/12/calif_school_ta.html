<p>With too many students and too few classrooms, Calexico school officials took the unusual step of hiring someone to photograph children and document the offenders. Santillan snaps pictures at the city&rsquo;s downtown border crossing and shares the images with school principals, who use them as evidence to kick out those living in Mexico. </p>
<p>Since he started the job two years ago, the number of students in the Calexico school system has fallen 5 percent, from 9,600 to 9,100, while the city&rsquo;s population grew about 3 percent. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The community asked us to do this, and we responded,&rdquo; school board President Enrique Alvarado said. &ldquo;Once it starts to affect you personally, when your daughter gets bumped to another school, then our residents start complaining.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Every day along the 1,952-mile border, children from Mexico cross into the United States and attend public schools. No one keeps statistics on how many. </p>
<p>Citizenship isn&rsquo;t the issue for school officials; district residency is. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled illegal immigrants have a right to an education, so schools don&rsquo;t ask about immigration status. But citizens and illegal immigrants alike can&rsquo;t falsely claim residency in a school district. </p>
<p>Enforcement of residency requirements varies widely along the border. Some schools do little to verify where children live beyond checking leases or utility bills, while others dispatch officials to homes when suspicions are raised. </p>
<p>Jesus Gandara, superintendent of the Sweetwater district, with 44,000 students along San Diego&rsquo;s border with Mexico, said tracking children at the border goes too far. &ldquo;If you do that, you&rsquo;re playing immigration agent,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>The El Paso Independent School District in Texas sends employees to homes when suspicions are raised. But spokesman Luis Villalobos said photographing students at the border would be a monumental, unproductive effort. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the thinking in Calexico, a city 120 miles east of San Diego that has seen its population double to 38,000 since 1990. A steel fence along the border separates Calexico from Mexicali, an industrial city of about 750,000 that sends shoppers and farm laborers to California. </p>
<p>Calexico&rsquo;s rapid growth outstripped school resources, resulting in overcrowding and prompting demands that Mexican interlopers be ousted. Taxpayers complained their children were bused across town because neighborhood schools were full, even after Calexico voters approved a $30 million construction measure in 2004. Portable classrooms proliferated. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Calexico residents support the crackdown. </p>
<p>Fernando Torres, a former mayor, was upset when the district said his grandchildren would have to transfer because there was no room in their neighborhood school. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right&rdquo; for U.S. taxpayers to build classrooms for Mexican residents, he said. The district eventually relented. </p>
<p>School board member Eduardo Rivera estimates there are still 250 to 400 students from Mexico attending Calexico&rsquo;s schools. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a continual struggle,&rdquo; Rivera said. &ldquo;You have people who are determined to continue sending their kids over here.&rdquo; <br>

			<p>I work hard, very hard everyday so that low lifes, scofflaws, and illegals can have for FREE what I bust my back for. I sure wouldn&rsquo;t want them to think I was racist now would I? And why should they have to do what&rsquo;s right just because I do?</p>

			<p>&gt; Eventually, this and other illegal decisions made by the courts will put enough of a burden on states that they will start to &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; the decisions. Then, the fun will begin. Most of the federal power over the states, resides with the court. If their decisions are burdensome, and obviously illegal, there is the temptation to simply ignore them and see if the feds have the will to do anything about it (they don&rsquo;t&hellip;.they really don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Guess again. They did it when they desegregated the south with federal troops.</p>
<p>Congress is a different story, though. One of the best-kept secrets of American jurisprudence is that Congress can effectively nullify SCOTUS decisions. It&rsquo;s right there in Article III, Section 2 of the constitution, where Congress is given the power to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the courts. If congress wanted, it could simply forbid the federal courts from heretofore hearing any case involving illegal aliens, and that would be the end of this nonsense. Congress also has other ways of punishing the black-robed tyrants, like cutting their staff and salary, and packing SCOTUS.</p>
<p>Some people on the right are already talking about how Congress needs to start using these powers to put the courts in their place.</p>
<p>Anyway, now you know why most of the ire of the federal courts have historically been directed at the states and local governments, and why they very rarely cross Congress.</p>

<p>Personally, I think their own self interests extend to whatever financial interests they (the people turning a blind eye to this) may have in Mexico.  Some school districts are notorious for having conflicts of interests in financial matters.  However, in this case, it involves a mega-city as a very real threat to what used to be a nice small town.  I remember when Calexico was a nice place to go to relax, and Mexicali was just some city across the border.  Now it looks like Mexicali is the mega-city that lies, fraud and graft built, and Calexico is being run by some people who don&rsquo;t care if they become part of that.  What the heck is &#8220;Superintendent&#8221; Jesus Grandara thinking, and is he in cahoots with someone across the border to let OUR students be in portable &#8220;Classrooms&#8221; instead of a decent school?  Portables are by definition TEMPORARY.  They are substandard, poorly heated and ventilated, noisy, dirty, spider and bug attracting structures.  Why are our children&rsquo;s educations being dumbed down in such places?</p>

			<p>If this article does not arouse a feeling of utter rage in the reader, WHAT, pray tell, does?</p>
<p>The idea of Amerca hosting the students of a third-rate hellhole like Mexico, without the approval of, and very likely, a massive cover-up by local officials&hellip; calls for a complete change in government, and a fence so tight a lizard could not cross the border unchallenged!</p>
<p>We got yet another of those typical, &#8220;poor immigrant woman&#8221; sob-stories in the Houston Chronicle last weekend. How she risked life and limb to trudge through the desert (listen for the violins, please)&hellip; to better things for herself and her family. Etc., etc., etc.   &mdash;   all those usual fine-sounding lies, half-truths and distortions our controlled news media loves to dish out.</p>
<p>What will it take, to organize and effect a march on Washington by TWO MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS AND VOTERS? To demand our crooked politicians get busy, enacting laws aimed at driving ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS back across the Mexican border. WE NEITHER WANT, NOR NEED THEM! Much less the crime, parasitism, animalistic mentality they bring with them.</p>
<p>Has anyone forgotten those stupid, empty faces waving Mexican flags and changing &#8220;viva Mexico&#8221; or some nonsense like that, during the demonstrations in May, 2006? Those parasites come here, greedily sponging off American taxpayers and our American economy. While not having the human decency to show even the slightest loyalty to America. Stupid, abysmally ignorant primitives, who steal their way across the border, then greedily pick the pockets of American taxpayers with their incessant demands for hand-outs, FREE this and FREE that. While hardly being above robbing us blind with millions of burglaries, petty thefts, drug crimes, car jackings, nor overlooking the Mexican penchant for rape, and sexual abuse of children.</p>
<p>Then, adding insult to injury, our controlled media spouts their incessant falsehoods trying to elicit sympathy for the &#8220;poor Mexican and Latin-American immigrants&#8221; who just want their [UNDESERVED] share of the American Dream. While mouthing lies about Americans refusing to do the jobs the Hispanics come for.</p>
<p>DRIVE THE ILLEGALS BACK TO MEXICO! When the corporations and smaller business entities are faced with either paying a fair wage and HIRING Americans or losing business, things will change. But let&rsquo;s get serious, while we&rsquo;re at it&hellip; by FORCING welfare recipients of all kinds to do some meaningful work for what they get. Able-bodied people doing the jobs offered&hellip; or at least baby-sitting the children of those working&hellip; We need to restore the work ethos to America, and re-instill pride in WORKING instead of sitting back and collecting hand-outs. Most of all, to rid our politicians, our controlled news media, and certainly, the business world, that we CAN INDEED survive very well without the so-called &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; from Mexico and points south!<br>

			<p>&#8220;The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled illegal immigrants have a right to an education, so schools don&rsquo;t ask about immigration status.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Supreme Court ruling is an absolute wrong against the citizens of the United States - not only because it requires taxpayers to reward lawbreakers, but lawbreakers who are citizens of a foreign country. This is insanity on stilts. </p>

			<p>The borders must be very different down there.  </p>
<p>As a Canadian crossing into northern New York, I have to show proper I.D. or passport, and undergo a quick interrogation about the nature and purpose of my visit, and possibly a look around my car.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s that stringent at the California border if the same children are doing it five days a week.  </p>

			<p>Excuse me, but I wouldn&rsquo;t denigrate the intelligence of Mexican people. How intelligent is the American citizenries token resistance in the face of massive identity theft, wage depression, forced taxation to pay for education of foreign nationals, forced taxation to pay for anchor babies costs, etc. etc. No my friends, we should tread very lightly when it comes to sizing up others by all standards, successfull actions in bilking the citizenry out of untold resources and well,enough said!</p>

			<p>When we lived in Columbus, NM,my children attended public school there. Most of the children attending that elementary school were from Las Palomas, 3 miles south, just across the border. Everyday, their parents dropped them off, then picked them up in the afternoon. English was hardly ever spoken during the school day. Those children attended a school supported by our tax dollars and received free lunches as well.</p>

			<p>Bobby:  I would call the Mexican illegals who plague our nation parasites rather than intelligent.  This mass invasion from Mexico is new to the American experience and people are in a state of shock and denial.  This state of shock and denial is only temporary and at some point Americans will decide they have had enough.  These Mexican interlopers will then be hunted for sport and then we will see how intelligent they are&hellip; </p>

			<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone hunted for sport, but simply be subject to existing immigration laws. That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s needed. Respect for, and adherence to the laws of the land and the nations philosopy. (Constitution) This is the root problem we are having in this nation that all the rest are growing out of.</p>

			<p>Bobby:  The Mexican illegals are all subject to our laws, however, they have no respect for the rule of law; theirs or ours.  When we deport them they sneak right back in again and again and they relish in disrespecting our sovereignty, nationality; language and culture.  If you happen to have some magic fairy dust that can be sprinkled over their heads to make them return to their own country I wish you would share it with the rest of us.  If not I&rsquo;m afraid we will be forced to use more dramatic means to encourage these invaders to self-deport and leave us in peace&hellip;        </p>

			<p>I agree with what you say about the utter disprespect so many Mexican illegals have. In fact I agree with just about everything you&rsquo;ve written. What my point always is, is that the utter blindness, apathy, laziness, and general unconcernedness for it all by honest taxpaying American citizens,is what just blows me away. It is Americans themselves that seem far too unconcerned about all of the lawbreaking,and disrespect that you mention,that is so amazing to me. I really am getting to believe that most Americans consider their nation really nothing more than an economic zone, and whether or not they can profit from it, just like so many of the illegals. If this is true, is it any wonder at all then, that the politicians sense this attitude and act accordingly  &mdash;  do nothing. For politicians to act, they need massive support by the citizenry. Even when they have it,many don&rsquo;t want to. Afterall, only the most naive people still believe that people who go into politicis do so in order to serve the &#8220;public interest&#8221;.</p>

<p>For politicians to act all they need is an under the table financial incentive from corporate racketeers or foreign government bagmen, because they don&rsquo;t give a damn about the citizenry&hellip; </p>
