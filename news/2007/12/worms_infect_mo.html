						<p>Roundworms may infect close to a quarter of inner city black children, tapeworms are the leading cause of seizures among U.S. Hispanics and other parasitic diseases associated with poor countries are also affecting Americans, a U.S. expert said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Recent studies show many of the poorest Americans living in the United States carry some of the same parasitic infections that affect the poor in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a tropical disease expert at George Washington University and editor-in-chief of the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said the United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars to defend against bio-terrorism threats like anthrax or smallpox or avian flu, which were more a theoretical concern than a real threat at present.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet we have a devastating parasitic disease burden among the American poor, right under our nose,&#8221; Hotez said.</p>
<p>He noted a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, presented in November, found that almost 14 percent of the U.S. population is infected with Toxocara roundworms, which dogs and cats can pass to people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said up to 2,000 new cases of neurological disease caused by tapeworms are diagnosed every year in the United States. More than 2 percent of adult Latinos may be infected, and with 35 million Hispanics in the United States, this could add up to tens of thousands of cases, Hotez said.</p>

					<p>I don&rsquo;t think &#8220;poor&#8221; is the punchline here.  I think non-white is.  And the reason that public health authorities aren&rsquo;t making a bigger deal of it is that they don&rsquo;t want to give right-wingers an epidemiological argument for immigration restriction.</p>

					<p><i>&hellip;with 35 million Hispanics in the United States&hellip;<i></i></i></p>
<p>Reuters is about <b>10 million<b> short on its Hispanic count. </b></b></p>
<p><b>Hispanic Population<b></b></b></p>
<p>44.3 million (as of July, 2006)</p>
<p>The estimated <b>Hispanic<b> population of the United States as of <b>July 1, 2006,<b> making people of Hispanic origin the nation&rsquo;s largest ethnic or race minority. Hispanics constituted 15% of the nation&rsquo;s total population.</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b>About 1<b><br>
&hellip; of every two people added to the nation&rsquo;s population between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006, was Hispanic. <b>There were 1.4 million Hispanics added to the population over the period.<b></b></b></b></b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.infoplease.com/spot/hhmcensus1.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.infoplease.com/spot/hhmcensus1.html</a></p>
<p>1.4 million Hispanics added to the population in just one year!  And that is an official number, which means that the tens of millions of illegals within the US are not included.</p>

					<p>Who is Dr Peter Hotez?  Some of those racist anti-white white and black people blame the <span class="caps">USA </span>for everything.  <span class="caps">AIDS </span>for example was underfunded by the <span class="caps">USA. </span> For every cent the spends on <span class="caps">AIDS </span>it needs to spend a dollar on preventing heart disease and another dollar on preventing diabetes.  The bottom line is <span class="caps">AIDS </span>is not a big deal here.  The only reason it is made to be a big deal is the africans are scared to death of its future effects.  I&rsquo;m not.  I&rsquo;m interested in protecting Americans and not foreigners.  Parasites and worms have been in humans for thousands of generations.  Deal with it and get over it.  </p>

					<p>I had a conversation a few months ago with a Mexican fellow, and he told me how necessary it was to de-worm yourself and your kids twice a year.  He took it as a given that I too, had intestinal parasites.  No, Senor, I wash my hands with soap.  </p>

					<p>Thought for food&hellip; .</p>
<p>Those ubiquitous slop trucks   &mdash;   taco trucks and pushcart vendors starting to <span class="caps">INFEST </span>so many American cities and towns&hellip;</p>
<p>Just imagine what you&rsquo;re likely to catch, eating that slop peddled by Juan, Jose, Pepe and Vincente from those pushcarts and trucks. Mention sanitation to the average Mexican and he&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re trying to get him a job working on the track pickup trucks. Miguel, pushing his little cart along, gets the urge. Unzips while more or less blocking the view with the cart, lets fly. Then when finished, wipes his hands on his pants; moves the pushcart a few yards, and makes a burrito for the next victim (I mean) customer. Here in Houston, the City Council wants to set rules for those truck and pushcart vendors. Needless to say, &#8216;RACISM&rsquo; is the battlecry from those Mestizos affected by the enacted rules.</p>
<p>One of our co-workers wouldn&rsquo;t listen. He bought a couple of breakfast tacos(?) from a slopcart vendor last year. Got a bad case of food poisoning, and was home sick for three days. Now he&rsquo;s got the good sense to to avoid those slopcart vendors like the plague. Any questions?</p>

					<p>Let us not forget the return of the Bedbug! That is another little gift that has been brought back thanks to our open borders. I always check out the beds in any hotel/motel before I even unpack as you never know who slept there before you. Not to mention most of the maids are third worlders. I suggest you do the same or you may bring home these suckers to your family. </p>

					<p>Not just the taco trucks and mexican food restaurants!<br>
Take a look at the kitchen of nearly any restaurant or hotel and see who is doing food prep(that would be preparing salads, and other <span class="caps">UNCOOKED </span>food that you might order from the menu.<br><br>
It&rsquo;s a low skill, low wage job, so guess who is doing it, in most cases?</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;a Mexican fellow, and he told me how necessary it was to de-worm yourself and your kids twice a year.&#8221; (Posted by Schoolteacher at 3:03 AM on December 27)</p>
<p>I was told by Mexicans in Mexico that the de-wormer medicine &#8220;Vermox&#8221; is given to children in their schools once every six months, and that the rest of the family takes the medicine at the same time so that the de-worming will be synchronized for the family, and they won&rsquo;t immediately re-infect each other.</p>
<p>My informant, either telling me the truth or trying to &#8220;impress&#8221; the gullible gringo (I think the former), said that before Vermox was available, Mexicans de-wormed with a certain green plant eaten with milk, but that Vermox was an improvement because the plant de-wormer resulted in children being very frightened at seeing what came out of them.</p>
<p>The doctor in the village I stayed in had trained at the University of Guadalajara, where he said there was an excellent parasitology department where many doctors from Europe studied, since in their own countries there wasn&rsquo;t the same opportunity to see actual specimens of parasites, results of infection, etc. (He had some interesting tales of multi-cultural misunderstandings at Univ. of Guadalajara: Swiss and German doctors asking him if mexican doctors were gay, since the Mexican doctors would put their hands on them while talking to them, and Mexican doctors asking him why the Germans and Swiss were so &#8220;cold&#8221;).</p>
<p>I consulted him when I was preparing to return to the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>for his recommendation for what to take to hopefully kill anything I&rsquo;d picked up while in Mexico. He assumed as a matter of course that I (like everyone in the village) was infected, and said that since I wasn&rsquo;t having any symptoms obviously my body had adjusted to the infection just as the villagers&rsquo; bodies had. He recommended I take Vermox Plus, which kills amoebas as well as worms, etc.</p>
<p>Half of the men in this village were away working in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>while I was there, and more than half of the men who were still in the village had worked in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>at some time, and many were planning to go back.</p>
<p>My host was a strong man almost 80 who still worked his hillside orchard and planted his hillside cornfield. Many of these farmers were very fair-skinned, and my hostess had blue eyes.</p>

					<p>by the way at 11:35 <span class="caps">AM,</span> I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and in fact I have a hotel room routine.  If the room looks halfway decent, I strip off the comforter and throw it in a corner.  Hotels usually clean those only twice a year, and I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with the <span class="caps">DNA </span>samples that undoubtedly reside thereon.  Next, I strip off the pillow cases and replace them with ones I brought.  I then inspect the sheets themselves.  If they appear to be reasonably clean, I&rsquo;ll sleep in the bed.</p>
<p>If the hotel looks really bad, I carefully unroll my sleeping bag and put it on the bed.  </p>

					<p>As if their well-documented propensity to spit in Whitey&rsquo;s food (a la the Reverend Jesse Jackson) were not enough reason to avoid fast foods prepared and served by blacks and Hispanics, we must now reckon on the things that may actually be <span class="caps">SWIMMING </span>in their tolerant and culturally-enriching saliva. It is good that fast-food corporations that peddle high-fat and high-salt content slop should gear their  advertising to Blacks and Hispanics in any case, since Whites who eat in such places are taking risks on many levels.     </p>

					<p>In Vegas, <span class="caps">ALL </span>the kitchen workers are Mexicans and Third World. That includes the dishwashers, pot washers, prep cooks, pantry persons, cooks, bakers, floor cleaners, stewarding, etc. And as a former  food safety and sanitation Inspector at a major Hotel, I can assure you that their sanitation practices are horrendous. Eating anywhere in Vegas nowadays is risky business, especially the buffets and coffee shops. I&rsquo;ve even seen these illiterates drop food on the floor with the actual County health inspector present, and put the item back in the pan like nothing happened. Hand washing is a foreign concept to them, and they never call in sick no matter how sick they are. Can&rsquo;t miss making the dinero you know. What happens in Vegas, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily stay in Vegas. You might bring more home with you than just an empty wallet. </p>

I have to suppose that was  some time ago.  Today, with the Third World invasion that&rsquo;s going on in Europe, they must have plenty of horrible samples and specimens right there at home. No need to go study abroad now!  The World has come to Europe instead.</p>
<p>According to statistics, one third of the [blacks] in the Deep South (of the <span class="caps">USA</span>) are infected with either hookworms or roundworms. The Caribbean and Mexico are much worse.  (There are many, many kinds of worms, flukes,  and other loathsome parasites that attack humans internally and externally.)   If that&rsquo;s the statistic here, where they&rsquo;re better off than anywhere else in the world, then  those &#8220;refugees&#8221;, &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, and &#8220;guest workers&#8221;  that are  pouring in from Africa, Turkey, India,  SE Asia, must be virtually <span class="caps">ALL </span>infected with them.  I would assume that they <span class="caps">ARE.</span></p>
<p>Hookworm, roundworm, whipworm,  pinworm, threadworm,  tapeworm,  trichina  worm, herringworm, codworm,  guinea worm, etc. &hellip;  there are many, many types of parasites that infest humans, mostly found in tropical countries with backward sanitation practices. These countries  are the sources for most (almost all) of the immigration now pouring into the Western world.  Remember, these are the people preparing your foods and washing your dishes in almost any restaurant, not to mention making your beds in every hotel.</p>

<p>The World has come to Los Angeles instead (unfortunately)&hellip;.</p>
<p>Browser:<br>
 <br><br>
It took awhile but I read through every site you posted  &mdash;  scary indeed, especially as I live outside of Los Angeles, capital of the Third World.  Virtually every restaurant, fast-food or otherwise, rich, poor and in between is staffed by Third World Mexicans  &mdash;  God knows what the kitchens look like, let alone the bathroom habits (or lack thereof) of these food handlers.</p>
<p>A trusted health professional told me to <span class="caps">NEVER EVER </span>eat out here and to inoculate myself and my loved ones against Hep A (Hep B is now required for the kiddies here in Cali. thanks to unfettered Third World immigration).<br>
