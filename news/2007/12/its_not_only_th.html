<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Low-skilled workers from outside the EU were yesterday banned from Britain as the Government finally admitted worries about immigration are not confined to &lsquo;Alf Garnetts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Home Office &mdash; which said it could not ignore public alarm over immigration &mdash; also unveiled plans to stop foreigners entering the country on a marriage visa if they fail an English test.</p>
<p>In a further move targeting arranged marriages which take place in India and Pakistan, the age at which a British citizen can bring a husband or wife into the country from abroad will be raised to 21.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said Britain is not a nation of &lsquo;Alf Garnetts&rsquo; &mdash; a reference to the racist television comedy character.</p>
<p>He said the public has legitimate concerns which need addressing, before conceding: &#8220;We ignore concerns about the wider impact of immigration at our peril.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreign workers such as teachers and plumbers from countries such as Poland, which is part of the EU, do not face the new restrictions &mdash; but from outside the EU they would only be allowed in if there was a skills shortage under new plans</p>
<p>Critics say the ban on low-skilled workers will have little impact, because the Government remains powerless to limit arrivals from inside the EU &mdash; including Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Government officials admit the 20,000 low-skilled migrants who will be turned away each year will simply be replaced by Romanians and Bulgarians, who joined the EU earlier this year.</p>
<p>There were also question marks over the crackdown on marriage visas, which allows 41,100 immigrants to enter the country each year.</p>
<p>It is certain to face challenges under the Human Rights Act, which protects a couple&rsquo;s fundamental right to marriage and a family life.</p>
<p>The Home Office is also likely to include loopholes on the English test, allowing some spouses a short period of grace to live in Britain if they fail the exam.</p>
<p>But the language used by ministers &mdash; along with the open confirmation it is not racist to worry about immigration &mdash; shows they are at last admitting the unprecedented influx of arrivals from abroad cannot continue.</p>
<p>Mr Byrne will say in a speech today: &#8220;What emerges from the debate I&rsquo;ve listened to is British reason at its finest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sophisticated, intelligent views and a profound sense of fairness and tolerance for a Britain in which we live and let live and actually try a bit harder to be a bit more welcoming, and a bit less shy about saying hello.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not a nation of Alf Garnetts. But the deal we want to put on the table is not unconditional.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, the rules are unambiguous &mdash; speak the language, obey the law, and make sure you&rsquo;re paying your taxes like the rest of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very British tough-minded fairness.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is a sense in the public mind that the sooner newcomers start on the type of journey we have in mind, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, in her first major speech on immigration, said yesterday: &#8220;For all its undoubted benefits, the increased flow of migration that the UK and other countries have experienced has brought with it important challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ban on low-skilled workers will be included in the introduction of a points-based system for all migrants, due early next year.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Jacqui Smith will call the measures the &lsquo;biggest shake-up of our immigration system in our history&rsquo;</p>
<p>Originally, a tier had been set aside for labourers and fruit pickers from outside the EU.</p>
<p>But that has been suspended for the &lsquo;foreseeable future&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Instead, any unskilled jobs will be taken by EU workers.</p>
<p>Opponents say the Government is &lsquo;closing the door after the horse has bolted&rsquo;, with migrants from Asia and Africa being punished for poor decision-making over EU expansion.</p>
<p>English tests for spouses will also target developing countries.</p>
<p>They were introduced for foreigners taking British citizenship from November 2005 and were extended to those seeking settlement in April this year.</p>
<p>Widening the scope to spouses is expected to have a particular impact on the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, which between them saw 17,000 spouses enter the UK last year.</p>
<p>o Foreign criminals with unspent convictions will finally be barred from winning citizenship, the Home Office said last night.</p>
<p>It follows revelations that one of the July 21 bombers had been handed a passport despite a string of criminal convictions.</p>
<p>Current rules allow foreign criminals to be granted citizenship, regardless of their offence, provided they manage a &lsquo;clear&rsquo; period without breaking the law.</p>
<p>Jacqui Smith said any convict jailed for 30 months or more would be banned. So would anybody guilty of a violent, sexual or drugs crime.</p>
<p>Foreigners guilty of minor misdemeanours would be blocked until their conviction was considered spent.</p>
