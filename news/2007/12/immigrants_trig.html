<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Siobhan O&rsquo;Donahue was in a hurry.</p>
<p>Trying to nail her down for an interview, you get the impression this is a permanent state of affairs &mdash; rushing from one meeting to another, dealing with a succession of increasingly urgent cases.</p>
<p>The director of a drop-in centre that looks after immigrants in Dublin, Siobhan says they are picking up the problems that nobody has sought fit to deal with: schooling, housing, access to healthcare.</p>
<p>She argues that Ireland invited immigrants to come and work, without giving any thought to their wider impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw them essentially as units of labour,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t see them as people with social and community needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The planning and infrastructure wasn&rsquo;t put in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there are plenty of people to cater for. This is a country that had few foreign residents right up until the late 1980s.</p>
<p>But then came an economic boom, and a relatively-poor, agricultural nation became instead the &#8220;Celtic Tiger&#8221;.</p>
<p>The result is that now, more than one in seven people in Ireland was born outside the country. </p>
<p>The largest group are Poles, about 65,000 at the most recent count, but there are Lithuanians, Czechs, and also workers from beyond the EU, from Africa and Asia. </p>
<p><b>Immigrants&rsquo; anger</b></p>
<p>In fact, the percentage of immigrants here rose faster in 10 years than it did in Britain over half a century.</p>
<p>&#8220;The entire system has been based on a declining population,&#8221; says Paul Rowe, the director of an education charity. </p>
<p>&#8220;The system is trying to reconfigure itself for expansion in a very short period of time. It is a huge change.&#8221; </p>
<p>And he should know. Last August, Paul Rowe&rsquo;s charity, Educate Together, had to set up a primary school in just four weeks. </p>
<p>The Education Department had belatedly realised there were not enough places for immigrants&rsquo; children in the town of Balbriggan. </p>
<p>They had been turned down by the local schools. Like most in Ireland, they are run by the Church, and take Catholic children as a first choice. </p>
<p>The result was that they ended up in an emergency facility, one that caters almost exclusively for boys and girls of African or Arab origin. </p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather my children knew how Irish children live,&#8221; says one mother there, disappointed to see her son going to school only with other black children. </p>
<p>Another was more angry: &#8220;They didn&rsquo;t plan it the way it should be,&#8221; she argues. </p>
<p>&#8220;Immigrants are really contributing to the country&rsquo;s economy. They should be provided with the proper amenities.&#8221; </p>
<p><b>&#8216;Enormous turbulence&rsquo; </b></p>
<p>The Irish government insists it takes these complaints seriously. </p>
<p>This year, it appointed a minister for integration, Conor Lenihan. </p>
<p>He is perfectly frank about the challenges Ireland faces, adjusting so fast and so late in the day to mass immigration. But he also sees an advantage - that Ireland can learn from others&rsquo; mistakes. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no one country you can point to that&rsquo;s actually got migration correct. There&rsquo;s a great opportunity for Ireland to choose its course,&#8221; he suggests. </p>
<p>But Mr Lenihan is also aware of the potential tensions if Ireland experiences a downturn, something many economists see on the horizon. </p>
<p>&#8220;The real danger is that employers might let go of Irish workers, as opposed to the foreigners, and that could cause enormous turbulence.&#8221; </p>
<p><b>Recession &#8216;challenge&rsquo; </b></p>
<p>In fact the signs of that turbulence are already apparent. The most thorough European survey of attitudes to immigration showed that Irish people were averagely well-disposed to foreign workers, neither unusually welcoming nor unusually hostile compared to other EU countries. </p>
<p>But ask opinion on a Dublin street corner, and you will hear plenty of individuals whose attitude is decidedly resentful. </p>
<p>&#8220;They take the money they&rsquo;re earning back out of the country,&#8221; I was told by one local. &#8220;The Irish economy is losing.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The money&rsquo;s all being given to foreigners,&#8221; says another. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not fair on the Irish public.&#8221; </p>
<p>Even those who support immigration are apprehensive. The Irish Times columnist Fintan O&rsquo;Toole believes passionately that the mass arrival of foreigners has benefited his country. But he acknowledges the potential difficulties ahead. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s easy to be upbeat and welcoming when the cake is getting bigger all the time. The challenge is when you move into a period of recession. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have to be calm, we have to avoid getting hysterical. The real test of our society is coming.&#8221; </p>
