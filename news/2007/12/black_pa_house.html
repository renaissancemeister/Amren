<p>Just after Rep. Tim Mahoney, D-Uniontown, finished explaining an amendment he wanted to make on Senate Bill 1, the open records bill, the Black Caucus members walked, one by one, to a microphone and said they would be on leave for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could be doing this (walking off) until we get meaningful gun legislation,&#8221; said Rep. Thomas Blackwell, D-Philadelphia. &#8220;Every entity seems to get their business done on the floor except us. Our constituents aren&rsquo;t talking about doing something on open records. They are talking about kids dying in the streets.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We will boycott anything else until our voices are heard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are 203 members of the House. All Black Caucus members are Democrats. Votes can still be taken without them, but it would leave the 102 Democrats in the House with only 86 votes.</p>

					<p>The cities in which a lot of blacks live already have &#8220;meaningful gun legislation&#8221; (i.e. bans or near-bans).  Look how well they worked.</p>
<p>If their absence doesn&rsquo;t preclude a quorum, then in my mind, the Pennsylvania State House can table anything gun-control related forever, thereby meaning the Black Caucus would stay away for that long.  In the interim, maybe they can watch YouTube videos on John Street&rsquo;s iPhone.</p>

					<p>Like the national Democrats, Rep. Thomas &#8220;Black Cat&#8221; Blackwell is out of ideas and out of control.  To make gun legislation &#8220;meaningful,&#8221; you&rsquo;d have to cut off the fingers of half the young, black males in Philly.  Since I live in an armed white community  &mdash;  armed to the teeth, in fact  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve yet to buy my first gun but, sometimes, I google them and read.  That big Remington 12 gauge looks nice.  I&rsquo;d rather read a cosy, British mystery or listen to Schnabel, yet this is the world that the heirs to Camelot have given us.</p>

					<p>I doubt that even these black demagogues really believe outlawing guns will keep their criminals from acquiring them.</p>
<p>They favor banning guns, because they know that if this sky-rocketing black crime continues whites are going to eventually bite back, and they know blacks will be toast if that happens, so what they really want to do is disarm whites.</p>
<p>In short, they childishly believe that by disarming all citizens they will prevent civil war.  But what they&rsquo;re not bright enough to figure out is that the only thing that will keep the tribes from each other&rsquo;s throats is to rein in black violence, and, of course, they can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The wretched curse of any society is having a black population.</p>

					<p>We need &#8221; meaningful black &#8221; legislation,intead of more gun laws; like reinstituting &#8221; separate but equal &#8221; racial segregation survivalists laws. Guns do not commit crimes but humans do; especially non-white ones.</p>

					<p>A couple thoughts:</p>
<p>1)You know that the Left is feeling its oats when they freely choose to do battle with the National Rifle Association.</p>
<p>2) And to minorities visiting this site:  Whether you&rsquo;re black or brown, respectively, you have far more to fear from your brown and black (respectively) &#8216;neighbors&rsquo; than you do 97% of the white population.  Despite this new unfriendly rivalry among peoples of color in the Unitd States, your political leaders of color would have you bring knives to a gunfight &hellip;.. Bon Appetit.</p>

					<p>My goodness!  They are begging you! They are <span class="caps">PLEADING </span>with you!  If you have an ounce of Christian charity in your souls, <span class="caps">GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT</span>!!</p>
<p><span class="caps">PASS</span> A <span class="caps">LAW THAT SENDS BLACK MEN WITH GUNS</span> TO <span class="caps">PRISON</span>!!!</p>
<p>What else can they poor black people do?  They kn who is killing them, they kno who is shooting their babies right off their front steps   &mdash;   it is <span class="caps">YOUNG BLACK MEN.</span></p>
<p>And, yes, I know, they will call yo a racist for sending their youngf men to prison.  they will call your society and your race evil.  They can&rsquo;t help it.  They are black.  If you agree to save them from themselves by preventing black killers from getting guns they will swear at you and chastize you, but for heaven&rsquo;s sake, they are humans nonetheless and even in their ignorance, duplicity and hypocrisy, they deserve to live.  </p>
<p>So save them from their own killer spawn and ban black gun ownership now!</p>
<p>They begged us to save them from themselves in the mid 1980&rsquo;s when they started using crack and killing each other like jungle predators and we did. </p>
<p>We can do it again, and we should.  They canot control their own people or communities and they need us to help.</p>
<p>But charity only goes so far.  If they want to disarm white people, leaving us prey to their depredations, we must answer them No and No.  We cannot become victims to their murderous children.</p>
<p>So let every white gun dealer take a solemn pledge not to sell weapons to black folks.  Let every gun manufacturer swear not to sell guns to any black gun dealer. Le every gun show refuse entry to black people until the scourge of gun violence no longer causes the entire black community to live in fear of their own children.</p>

					<p>The national debate on guns is rapidly taking on racial overtones.</p>
<p>Black legislators blame the pathologies of their urban underclass constituents on middle-class Whites living elsewhere. It sounds as if they are trying to disarm potential <span class="caps">VICTIMS </span>of their criminal constituencies; witness the recent mob action against the Texan who killed two illegal alien burglars. They know the &#8220;criminals&#8221; that middle-class Whites arm themselves against are generally percieved as <span class="caps">NON</span>-WHITE.</p>
<p>What kind of reaction would come forth from the lamestream media if the <span class="caps">NRA </span>published &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; in The American Rifleman?</p>

					<p>&#8220;Meaningful&#8221; is inherently a meaningful word. However, because it has been hi-jacked by the usual suspects, it now has a rather nebulous and quite proprietary meaning. Translated, it now means something like &#8220;Liberal&#8221;.<br>
But of course if only &#8220;meaningful&#8221;(liberal) gun legislation is admissible, it is high time to stock up on ammo.<br><br>
Wittgenstein is becoming increasingly necessary to understand our native tongue, it appears.<br><br>
A parallel example is the concept of progress before and after The Progressives. Now we have it that &#8220;Progress&#8221; is tantamount to &#8216;improvement&rsquo;, which is obviously false, however, through repetition of the same falsehood, the two ideas have become one, at least in the public mind.<br><br>
You may say that I am nitpicking and perhaps to an extent I am. All the same, think of how &#8220;Progress&#8221; was cast as being necessary and how ever after that, everyone had to be in favor of &#8220;Progressive&#8221; ideas, even though the Progressive Party had disappeared into the underground in about 1920.<br><br>
By about 1950-55, since the public had already been duped into confusing progress with improvement, what we had was both parties vying for the upperhand to see who could be the most &#8220;Progressive&#8221; and the party responsible for it didnt even have to field a candidate. Republicans had a more technologically oriented &#8220;Progress&#8221; and Dems, socially.<br><br>
The &#8220;Progress&#8221; we got from the Republicans was &#8220;Urban Renewal&#8221; (destruction) and the Federal Interstate Highway Act which destroyed American rail and made it too easy for us to escape to the leafy suburbs while our neighborhoods were being systematically destroyed.<br><br>
The Dems, of course, gave us the great &#8220;Progress&#8221; of Civil Rights and I will leave off further commentary there for obvious reasons.<br><br>
In short, our enemy advances by manipulation of language.<br><br>
Never lose an opportunity to correct someone when they make dangerous mistakes.</p>

					<p>What does &#8220;meaningful gun legislation&#8221; mean? Does it mean additional jail time for use of a fire arm in the commission of a crime? Or, that when a <span class="caps">THUG </span>is found with a stolen or otherwise misappropriated gun, he can expect to get extra jail time? Or, if a <span class="caps">FELON </span>is caught with a stolen or otherwise misappropriated gun, he can expect his parole/probation vacated and serve extra jail time? I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that those options would be tossed right out because it would be considered racially biased against their &#8220;constituents&#8221;. Instead, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that it means disarming the law abiding citizenry.</p>

					<p>Thomas Blackwell fails to realize that Pennsylvania is a large state - most of it white and much of it rural. Pushing for the regulation of guns is about as popular with non-big-city PA residents as enduring a root canal. </p>
<p>PA already has some of the most devious and underhanded state legislators in the country (they excel at giving themselves midnight pay raises). So a boycott by a few cry-baby, tantrum-throwing, black racist politicians won&rsquo;t make very much of a difference to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>Neither organization requested the sales ban be lifted, which goes to show you&hellip;</p>

					<p>Proposal Will Grab Guns from Young Adults and Youth in Ohio<br>
by Sportsmens Alliance on November 2nd, 2007 in 2nd Amendment Rights and Gun Control Issues</p>
<p>Legislation has been introduced in Ohio that will stop anyone under the age of 21 from hunting or shooting without supervision.</p>
<p>House Bill 354, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Boyd, D-Cleveland Heights, and Sandra Williams, D-Cleveland, prohibits anyone under 21-years-old from possessing a firearm. Under the bill, if an adult or youth who does not meet the age requirement plans to handle a firearm, he or she must do so in the presence of someone 21 or over. Licensed hunters who now take to the woods solo will have to bring a supervisor if the bill passes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If passed, this bill would have a devastating effect on efforts to attract new hunters and recreational shooters,&rdquo; said Rob Sexton, <span class="caps">USSA </span>vice president for government affairs. &ldquo;It is inconceivable that the government would send people between the ages of 18 and 21 to war, but prohibit them from hunting or target shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill sponsors claim that the legislation is aimed at preventing gun violence and accidents; however, hunters and recreational shooters promote safe handling of firearms. Accident rates among hunters and shooters are at historic lows.</p>
<p>For those under eighteen, parents are best equipped to make this decision, not the government,&rdquo; said Sexton.  &ldquo;The proposal will not stop criminals from using firearms, but it will stop hunters from passing on our traditions to the next generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>House Bill 354 has been referred to the House Criminal Justice Committee.</p>
<p>Boyd and Williams are two black politicans who probably have zero youth hunters in their area. This is an example of blacks being unable to manage things that whites can. Do these ladies think this will stop the brothers from killing each other? The rights of whites are stripped away because of black behavior.<br>
Black kids are shooting each other at a record rate? Well the answer is more gun legislation. In the 1960&rsquo;s Cleveland area high schools had rifle ranges in the schools. Try that in a black school.</p>

<p>Tell your constituents in the hood, Mr. Blackwell, that black people are so hopelessly deficient in civilizational abilities that they should immediately turn in their guns to the authorities. &#8220;Meaningful gun legislation&#8221; would be the requirement that all white people arm themselves, at home and in public with open carry or non-permit concealed weapons, in order to defend themselves from your gangbanging constituents.</p>

					<p>What an idiotic idea.  It almost reminds of the story about the Bolsheviks ordering the Red Army to storm the Czar&rsquo;s winter palace.  The Mensheviks were so upset of this that they walked out of the Second Congress of Soviets.</p>
<p>As Trotsky told Martov as his party walked out:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out. Go where you belong from now on  &mdash;  into the dustbin of history!&#8221;.</p>
<p>How different Russian history would have been the Mensheviks had participated in the Second Congress. </p>
<p>If history repeats itself to I think Mr. Blackwell&rsquo;s comments will be prescient:</p>
<p>&#8220;Every entity seems to get their business done on the floor except us.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Mr. Blackwell thinks his legislation is so important perhaps he should spend more time thinking about what he can bring to the table rather than consigning himself and black political power to Trosky&rsquo;s dustbin of history.</p>

					<p>Pardon a poor ignorant &#8216;furriner&rsquo;, but is a Black caucus even legal?  These buffoons have thrown away their party&rsquo;s majority.  Are they not subject to the party&rsquo;s caucus discipline?</p>

					<p>Amendment by amendment, the neo-commies are seeking to strip away the rights granted to Americans for centuries, with the aid of their minority &#8220;civil rights&#8221; group frontmen. Right now it looks like the attacks on the 2nd Amendment and 1st Amendment (hate crime legislation) are well underway. Not to mention the 4th under attack thanks to Patriot Act/War on Terror laws, too.</p>
<p>As for this issue, the main catalyst driving these &#8220;leaders&#8221; is the death of the violent, uneducated, illegitimate offspring of the violent, uneducated, illegitimate offspring before them. These &#8220;victims&#8221;, with few exceptions, are the same offenders who might rape, murder, and steal from you or I in the future. </p>
<p>Add in the criminal lifestyle glorification and brazen &#8220;in your face&#8221; thug attitudes they seem to broadcast 24-7-365, is it any wonder they drop like flies every weekend in Philly, N&rsquo;awlins, or  Detroit? To quote their &#8220;civil rights hero&#8221; Malcolm X (another victim of black on black gun violence): &#8220;It&rsquo;s a case of the chickens coming home to roost.&#8221; </p>

					<p>The <span class="caps">CBC </span>is right, they deserve meaningful legislation; black males should be prevented from owning firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, America doesn&rsquo;t have a gun violence problem, she has a black male gun violence problem.</p>

The issue is not guns. It&rsquo;s impulsiveness and self-control. Even if it was possible to remove every gun from every known violent black, the gun deaths would be replaced with knifing deaths.</p>
<p>The problem for the black community is not too many black men in the &#8216;prison industrial complex&rsquo; but too few.<br>

					<p>&#8220;Meaningful&#8221; gun legislation to be interpreted as Blacks having ready access to guns while Whites are denied the ability to defend themselves if waiting for police to arrive?</p>
<p>What the Black caucus refuses to countenance is the reality Black punks are hardly going to care what gun laws, if any, are passed. A practical question being: How many guns Black gangbangers purchase their guns legally? As opposed to stealing them or buying them from the thief who did steal them? It might be noted Blacks committing burglaries and thefts are hardly a rarity in <span class="caps">ANY </span>city with a Black population.</p>
<p>Take guns away from law abiding citizens   &mdash;   you leave them at the mercy of the criminal element. That old saw: If guns are outlawed then only outlaws will have guns&#8221; has a world of truth to it. But a highly inconvenient truth to gun control nuts like Senators Feinstein, Clinton and Obama.</p>
<p>Granted the shooting of burglars by Mr. Horn, in Pasadena, TX is <span class="caps">NOT </span>the proper way to deal with a crime in progress   &mdash;   but given the perps were Black Colombians   &mdash;   people with a bad reputation for violence and may well have threatened to kill Horn   &mdash;   provoking him to shoot in fear of his own life, when attempting to stop the burglary.</p>
<p>If you think owning at least <span class="caps">ONE </span>handgun, rifle or shotgun and keeping it accessible in your home is either dangerous or morally wrong, reflect on this: You make a 911 call on hearing glass breaking or someone trying to kick your door in. It can take five, ten, sometimes even fifteen minutes for a police officer to get to you. The <span class="caps">NEAREST </span>officers may be temporarily detained by other equally important duties. So those long minutes can literally cost you your life, or the rape and/or death of members of your family   &mdash;   if you have no real means of defense.</p>
<p>Try to explain that to the Black caucus members   &mdash;   but then again, Blacks are not especially noted for a high level of intelligence, unfortunately. A racial trait which also extends to Black politicians!</p>

They are only interested in their own political survival and convincing their &#8220;community&#8221; that they are &#8220;doing something&#8221; no matter how idiotic and worthless it is.<br>

					<p>The so-called black leadership always blames black crime on poverty and firearms.  If you gave every black in America one million dollars they would still continue to murder one another for money.  And if firearms simply disappeared blacks would resort to using knives and spears to commit robbery, rape and murder.  The so-called black leadership refuses to acknowledge that the propensity for blacks to commit crimes is genetically encoded and cannot be changed&hellip;    </p>

If &#8220;kids&#8221; are dying out there, it is because of criminals, and why should the rest of the population have their rights stripped away because of them?<br><br>

<p>You&rsquo;re more right than you know.  There was an article on cofcc.org in 1998, and the author was a white woman.  I think her name was Jennifer Passiamore (?) but I can&rsquo;t be sure.  Her point was that even if it were possible to make all deadly weapons (guns, knives, etc.) disappear, it would still be dangerous for whites, because of the gang/group mentality that blacks have, and the atomized/individualist mentality whites have.  Transpose that to a dark street.</p>

					<p>Very, very few blacks own legally purchased guns.  A very large majority of crimes committed with guns, even domestic violence shootings are committed with illegal guns, both unregistered guns and military type firearms forbidden to the general public.</p>
<p>The gun control laws are incredibly nit-picky and complex, more like a building code, all sorts of major and minor restrictions.</p>
<p>Whites fill out the forms, pay the fees and put up with the waiting period.  Not having felony records, Whites can legaly buy guns. But so many blacks have felony records, that they are restricted from buying firearms.  And even if they don&rsquo;t have records, it is cheaper and easier to buy a gun privately than to buy a gun from a gun shop.</p>
<p>Another thing, well known to law enforcement. Almost all black households have at least one gun.  And rather than in a safe place it is lying about where it can be easily misused in a fit of anger.</p>

					<p>The PA legislature should use this as an opportunity to drastically cut all non-medical welfare in the state. I can understand helping with a broken arm, but putting food on the table is your job. Now that the welfare clients&rsquo; representatives are out of the room their benefits can be cut. This cutoff may even reduce the size of the Black community in <span class="caps">PA, </span>and even slow the growth of an illegal community. </p>

					<p>The true roots of violence and crime among blacks is not to be found in any gun legislation, &#8220;meaningful&#8221; or otherwise. Thus it cannot be the answer anymore then a false diagnosis can be a cure.</p>

					<p>The reason so many blacks are arrested in the course of a routine traffic stop is that the police search the car.  More often than not, there is an open alcohol container, drugs or an illegal weapon in the car. </p>
<p>So the blacks are arrested.  These poverty pimp politicians fail to realize that gun control laws work to put criminals in prison.<br>
Maybe a black jury finds a black defendant innocent of attempted murder and assault but finds him guilty of the lessor charges of illegal possession of a gun and discharging a firearm within city limits.  Often a defense attorney advises an attempted murderer to plead guilty to the lesser charges.</p>
<p>Then the Judge can give the defendant the maximum sentence for the gun violations. And he is off to prison and Whites are a bit safer for a while.  </p>
<p>Just like the crack cocaine laws the congressional black caucus pushed through to attract attention and media coverage, the gun control laws adversely affect and incarcerate blacks because Whites obey the firearms regulations and blacks routinely violate gun regulations.</p>

<p>This is a succinct but excellent analysis of what is <span class="caps">WRONG </span>with our judicial/legal system. That the perp can <span class="caps">KILL </span>someone, that due to not quite enough evidence to &#8220;convince&#8221; the jury of his guilt, a deal is struck, the perp gets off with a light or non-existent sentence!</p>
<p>To hell with plea-bargaining. Time to get tough on criminals and warehouse them. NO to parole, <span class="caps">NO, </span>to lenient judges. It&rsquo;s like that peripathetic whine over the death sentence. Granted, a death sentence hardly is a deterrent   &mdash;   but you have to admit, an excuted killer is highly unlikely to kill another innocent victim! Get the point?</p>
<p>Yes, I AM familiar with the arguments against the death penalty. Just as I am about the claim it weighs more heavily on minorities. But lacking the latter, the corollary   &mdash;   that minority members DO commit far more murders than non-minority members (Whites). Also that minority members invariably have a lengthy rap sheet by the time they are on trial for murder. Unlike the average White murderer.</p>
<p>Here in Houston every time a death row inmate is about to get his just desserts, the local TV stations cover the vigil outside Huntsville Prison, dripping lugubrious prose over the poor, poor felon. While all but blaming <span class="caps">THE VICTIM </span>for leading the poor death row inmate astray, tempting him into his crime with their presence and for daring to have something the bad guy was willing to waste a human life to obtain. But that&rsquo;s the misguided liberal fools in the media for you, I guess.</p>
