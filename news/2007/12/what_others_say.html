						<p>THERE IS OLD SCHOOL, there&rsquo;s the African Big Man &hellip;   and then there&rsquo;s Comrade Jacob Gedleyihiekisa Zuma, who last week won the  presidency of South Africa&rsquo;s ruling African National Congress (ANC). </p>
<p>The boisterous and populist leader&rsquo;s reputation took a beating last year when he was charged with raping an HIV positive family friend. He was acquitted. </p>
<p>Having wrested the leadership of the ANC from Thabo Mbeki, unless he is convicted of corruption given that fresh charges are being brought against him, Zuma is all but assured of becoming South Africa&rsquo;s president in 2009. </p>
<p>With that prospect looming, far-sighted observers are already contemplating what The Times (London) called a &ldquo;pressing problem&rdquo;. That is, which of  Zuma&rsquo;s many wives, not to mention mistresses, would be the First Lady? </p>
<p>An &ldquo;unashamed Zulu traditionalist&rdquo; (according to the Times), Zuma is quite happy to admit publicly  that he is a polygamist. </p>
<p>He has recognised at least 18 children from &ldquo;four official&rdquo; marriages and several girlfriends. Two children have been born to him since his acquittal in the rape trial. </p>
<p>Zuma still does like some of our more old-fashioned fathers used to do. He  has a &ldquo;village wife&rdquo;, Sizakele Khumalo. She is the presumed &ldquo;No 1&rdquo;, and lives at his homestead in Nklanda, Kwazulu-Natal. He has no children with her. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;city wife&rdquo; is Mantuli Zuma, who married the big man five years ago. They have two children. Then there was Kabe Zuma. They had five children. She committed suicide in 2000.    </p>
<p>Diamini Zuma couldn&rsquo;t take his ways much longer. They divorced in 1998. They have four daughters. She is now Foreign minister and, not surprisingly, a Mbeki ally. </p>
<p>He has a true town wife in the person of Thobeca Stacy Mabhija, with whom he has two children. With a name like that, small wonder she works at a mobile phone company. The Times describes her as an elegant woman known for her designer outfits. </p>
<p>As with very many men, there is an old-flame, Minah Shongwe, in the frame. She has a son with Zuma. </p>
<p>Comrade Zuma, by the way, is 65. Truly impressive that he still has so much energy at that age.</p>

&#8220;I found this to be utterly alarming, chilling and repugnant, and to my mind, if elected he goes on to carry out any such threats, South Africa should immediately be invaded by the EU military machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>But first, let the EU military machine, if there is such a thing, invade Europe. There is a massive invasion underway.</p>

			<p>The US Ambassador to Uganda once described Idi Amin&rsquo;s government as &#8220;racist, erratic and unpredictable, brutal, inept, bellicose, irrational, ridiculous, and militaristic.&#8221; Contemplating Africa, I&rsquo;m wondering, is a pattern emerging?</p>

			<p>I know one thing - Comrade Zuma is one ugly dude.  How could such an ugly dude find any women who would want a piece of him?  Also, how many of his children are in prison or have AIDS or have been charged with rape?  Does anyone know?  </p>

			<p>Hey, &#8220;the Black Anarch&#8221; (sic), </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably find inexpensive real estate in a country such as this, where you&rsquo;d happily find people like you running everything.  Just a thought.</p>

			<p>&#8220;this Zuma creature was supposed to have stated words to the effect that if he wins power, he will deal &lsquo;once and for all with the whites&rsquo; of SA including taking young white women&#8221;</p>
<p>- Would organizations like the UN, EU and United States let that happen?  They try to stop genoicide and killing everywhere else so why not South Africa?  But I agree if it does happen some white nation that still has balls(perhaps Russia?) should immediately invade and conquer South Africa to show them who is boss.  I think the U.S and western europe may be too mongrolized and feminized for that task now.  However, Eastern Europeans still have a racial identity and there lands have few non whites.  I personally think Britain should of sent troops to protect/evacuate it&rsquo;s blood kin in Zimbabawe but they lacked the balls to do that.  I mean if the killing of farmers did not even make them consider invading that land, I don&rsquo;t know what will. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate people of other races you just have to look out for your own kind.  It&rsquo;s one of the basic rules of nature, sadly too many whites have forgotten that.</p>

			<p>There is a little company called blackwater that could inject some civilization into SA. Sadly, bhutto&rsquo;s request for blackwater was turned down by pakistan.  Would it not be good if private security(mercenaries) is the answer to these pesky dictators?</p>

What&rsquo;s amazing is that this kind of stuff is just NORMAL to Africans. The (African) columnist doesn&rsquo;t seem shocked by any of it: he&rsquo;s merely reporting the typical facts of (African) life. </p>
<p>In fact, the writer even seems to give &#8220;The Big Man&#8221; an approving wink at the end about the leader&rsquo;s &#8220;impressive energy&#8221; impregnating his various wives, city wives, true town wives, concubines, baby-mamas, rape-victims, etc. </p>
<p>Know what&rsquo;s even more amazing? The rest of the world is expected to regard &#8220;our African brothers and sisters&#8221; as equals   &mdash;   despite the voluminous evidence to the contrary (including the sexual shenanigans of Comrade Zuma). <br>

			<p>Today Kenya is regressing towards the mean of black rule.  But out of a white man&rsquo;s sense of fairness we should look to black success stories to at least chronicle that they do exist and we are not intellectually stunted as a &#8220;civil rights leader.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Zuma will not become prez. US and Britain are helping Mbeki, that prolific pseudo-intellectual stooge, to deal with Zuma. Zuma is threatening the interests of major corporations and mining, which wanted Apartheid out the way so they could make big bucks. </p>
<p>BTW, quite a few white girls are already the concubines of black pols. They don&rsquo;t even have to force them, these chicks do it for the money and the social status. White women are the most prolific integrators of the races, genetically speaking.</p>

			<p>In South Africa&rsquo;s The Herald, Mandla Seleoane has a column dated today (note the reference to Eugene Valberg, speaker at the upcoming AR conference):</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Our Critics Were Right About the Roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;SOME time in the mid-&lsquo;80s, one Professor Eugene Valberg from the United States wrote a mini philosophical treatise on why black people in South Africa deserved to be oppressed and denied political rights&hellip;.He could not trust black people to manage a country, as he said, with five-lane roads, and feared that we might mess up a promising economy.</p>
<p>I wrote, then, a response to the good professor and debated not only what I saw as flawed reasoning processes in his work, but indeed challenged the audacity of an American to think that he could lecture anyone on democracy&hellip;</p>
<p>I would also argue that, on the whole, we have not destroyed a promising economy, but that we seem to have brought it to higher levels than the Nats would ever hope to.</p>
<p>However there is one aspect I would concede to Valberg and it is that we have made a mess of our roads.</p>
<p>I would concede to him that, the way we behave, it would appear indeed that we are not equipped to handle five-lane roads. The sort of things that one sees on our roads post-1994 are absolutely crazy and it is hard to understand why our government seems reluctant or unable to correct the situation.</p>
<p>The other day I was driving out of Silverton in the direction of Pretoria and there was some congestion at the intersection of Pretoria Road and Kraanvoël Street.</p>
<p>I thought that maybe there was an accident, but lo and behold, some fun-loving car-load of compatriots had parked in the middle of the road and were enjoying meat and drinks.</p>
<p>Everyone had to navigate their cars carefully past the party, whilst the revellers went about their pleasure nonchalantly.</p>
<p>When I learned to drive, and it was under the Nats, there were things I was taught you simply didn&rsquo;t do on the road.</p>
<p>I was taught you never operated a car on a public road if it emitted excessive smoke&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, all of these were good rules even though they were made by a system that we disliked intensely&hellip;</p>
<p>Under the Nats we just knew that there would be hell to pay if we did not observe them.</p>
<p>Yet how often do you come across a car that all but smokes you to death, driven with complete impunity on our roads today?</p>
<p>How often do you find people pushing a car on the freeway, and not really trying to get it off the road, but trying to reach some destination that way?&hellip;</p>
<p>So yes, I would give it to Valberg that we don&rsquo;t know how to behave on the sophisticated network of roads that we have and that our government does not appear to have a plan to get us to behave appropriately.</p>
<p>I would also concede that we have messed quite a few of those roads up as well, judging by the potholes that appear to be becoming a kind of permanent feature of our roads.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The author has other interesting past columns  &mdash;  being black, he can say things the white writers cannot, I guess. I &#8220;enjoyed&#8221;:</p>

<p>LOL!  A country controlled by white power, allowing blacks at the helm with strict oversight is a successful black run country?</p>
<p>And you also believe blacks built the pyramids, correct?  And they invented everything but weren&rsquo;t given credit for it, because all of it was covered up by devious whites? LOL!</p>

			<p>And to think our Congress disgraced itself and the American people by allowing Mandela to speak some years past.  We promote these mental midget thugs and abandon our own principles in the process.</p>
<p>Misery is on us and all other freedom loving whites&hellip;and it will never abate.</p>

			<p>He is just one more black african wanting to run a black african country (built by Whites) in black africa. Compare him to all the others, spot the difference. The king of swaziland insists that all teenage girls attend an annual bare-breasted inspection to enable him to select yet another bride. Any family who fails to send their daughter is fined one cow. True civilised behaviour indeed from a &#8216;king&rsquo; who builds a palace and supplies a new mercedes car for each of his new wives (16 so far I think) in his impoverished black african country which depends totally on overseas (White)aid. But all he is doing is impregnating as many black african women as he can, exactly as black africans do in USA/UK everyday and leaves the rest of us to pick up the bill. When will we learn?? Segregate now and send &#8216;em all back.</p>

			<p>Actually, I like the prospects for Africa. However, I was looking something up on Wikipedia the other day, and it mentioned, for this one politician in Africa, when he left power around 1996, it was the first time in history an elected official in Africa had stepped down after being replaced by another elected official. As they say, that&rsquo;s incredible. </p>

			<p>From the article posted by H Dumpty @ 4:34:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;on the whole, we have not destroyed a promising economy, but that we seem to have brought it to higher levels than the Nats would ever hope to.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a fiction.  We are assured that South Africa is experiencing an economic boom, and the statistics support this. If you count only stats of income and consumption, that is.  The truth is, many ANC-connected blacks are drawing huge salaries for jobs that they aren&rsquo;t qualified to do, or just as part of the price of doing business.  The reality is that they are producing nothing.</p>
<p>So, yes, it&rsquo;s boom times for luxury car dealers, but the roads are falling to pieces, power blackouts are a normal feature of life, the civil &#8220;service&#8221; is a bad joke, corruption is endemic. This &#8220;boom&#8221; is not driven by production, but by consumption.  The beneficiaries are living off the carcase of the economy that the Whites built. It won&rsquo;t last.</p>

			<p>Analog man &#8220;This &ldquo;boom&rdquo; is not driven by production, but by consumption.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their human development index (not numbers from S.A. government) has plummeted since blacks took over.  I think this &#8220;boom&#8221; is a complete fabrication.  Like you said, living off the shrinking carcass of what the white man built.</p>

			<p>Zuma is a Zulu.  Doesn&rsquo;t anyone remember that the whites in South Africa were relying on the Zulus to save them versus the ANC?</p>
