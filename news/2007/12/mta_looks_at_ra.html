						<p>Maryland Transit Administration Police said last night that they have found no evidence that the severe beating of a 26-year-old woman on a city bus this week was provoked and that they are investigating the attack as a possible racially motivated hate crime.</p>
<p>Nine middle school students have been charged as juveniles with aggravated assault and destruction of property in the Tuesday afternoon attack on a woman and her male companion on the No. 27 bus.</p>
<p>Police said yesterday that they have determined that there were two additional victims in the case &mdash; a third passenger and the bus operator who came to his assistance.</p>
<p>Investigators were examining video from a surveillance camera on the bus but had not completed their analysis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MTA Northern District Capt. David Marzola said yesterday that the suspects could face additional charges after the emergence of new information about the attack, which occurred about 3 p.m. Tuesday in the 800 block of West 33rd Street.</p>
<p>Jawauna Greene, an MTA spokeswoman, confirmed that investigators were considering racial hostility as a potential motivation for the assault, which left the female victim, Sarah Kreager, 26, with broken facial bones and other injuries after she was punched, kicked and dragged off the bus. Her male companion, Troy Ellis, was also beaten, but not as severely.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greene said the suspects, who have been released to their parents, are African-American while the two originally identified victims are white. Marzola said the suspects are also believed to have menaced an elderly passenger, who is white, and to have assaulted the bus operator, an African-American male who defended his passenger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said no evidence had been found to back up the claims of suspects&rsquo; parents that Kreager or Ellis had provoked the incident by spitting or displaying a knife.</p>
<p>Greene said that at the time the incident reports were taken, no child reported any spitting or knife being pulled. Gavrilis said the operator hadn&rsquo;t mentioned any provocation.</p>
<p>According to police, the operator&rsquo;s response &mdash; to summon police first rather than immediately intervening &mdash; was exactly what he had been trained to do.</p>
<p>Police said Robert Poole Middle School, which the suspects attend, has not been a problem and that they believe Tuesday&rsquo;s incident was the first involving the school this year. Gavrilis said the MTA Police have had an officer on that bus run since Tuesday and that the city schools&rsquo; police force has assigned extra officers to the Hampden school.</p>
<p>Greene, Gavrilis and Marzola said the assault was unusual for a bus system that this year has had no homicides, no rapes and no arsons. There was a non-fatal stabbing on an MTA bus last month in which police are still seeking a suspect, and Gavrilis recalled one non-fatal shooting in Westport last summer in which two suspects were arrested.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of 2007, police said, there have been only 381 crimes of any kind reported on its transit systems, which carry 250,000 riders a day. The vast majority, they said, are property crimes. The police were unable to produce detailed statistics yesterday to buttress their claim, but Gavrilis said he believes crime on the transit systems has been going down.</p>

<p>Greene, Gavrilis and Marzola said the assault was unusual for a bus system that this year has had no homicides, no rapes and no arsons.</p>
<p>In other words rapes, homicides and arson are to be expected when you rode the bus in years past?<br/>

					<p>As far as I am concerend Rosa Parks was a &#8220;Terrorist&#8221;, just look at what she caused. The blacks that robbed and beat her a few years ago rode in the front of the bus getting to her house to do this, just try riding <span class="caps">ANY </span>public transportation in any major city, especially after 4 <span class="caps">P.M..</span> Like I have said many times &#8220;Make <span class="caps">ANY </span>crime of one race on another race an automatic &#8216;Hate Crime&#8221;, just guess who would go crazy over that law?</p>

<p>&#8220;In October, a twice-convicted rapist was accused of yet another rape in an attack upon a woman at the Nursery Road Light Rail station in Linthicum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two rape convictions and he&rsquo;s on the streets. It makes me laugh when people claim the government protects us.</p>

<p><span class="caps">LOL  </span>there&rsquo;s hardly a problem at all. Yes, this is just the tack the paper would take if they could find a white somewhere committing one of these &#8216;crimes&rsquo;. Minimizing it all.  </p>

<p>No doubt this has resulted in quite a laugh among the city&rsquo;s &#8220;Black&#8221; &#8220;youth&#8221; as well as among their parents.</p>
<p>Civilized people are quick to blame &#8220;Blacks&#8221; for their behavior. <br/>
While it is true that White people are no longer safe riding public transportation, (and this is especially so since the corrupt politicians prosecuted Bernard Goetz for defending himself against a mob of &#8220;Black&#8221; &#8220;youth&#8221; while riding in the <span class="caps">NYC </span>subway system), the real blame should be placed on the criminal politicians and their &#8220;legal&#8221; system who enable such conduct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks&#8221; only do that which they know they can get away with. Its about time the real culprits be fingered: the politicians and the foul &#8220;justice&#8221; system that is the root cause of such violence by &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.</p>

It&rsquo;s remarkable that these pathetic slime will tell a story about being provoked, when there actually was a surveillance camera that caught the whole incident.</p>
<p>One aspect of low IQ that seems to come out more and more in news stories these days  &mdash;   low IQ people don&rsquo;t notice when there is a surveillance camera recording their actions. </p>

					<p> Wonder of wonders, a black-on-White attack is actually being called a hate crime, by the powers-that-be in Baltimore, no less! Notice how the parents of the black assailants already have concocted a fairy story about the two White victims &#8220;spitting&#8221; and &#8220;displaying a knife&#8221; (that&rsquo;s sure grounds for a nine-on-two assault, isn&rsquo;t it?) I seem to recall a passage from either &#8220;Tom Sawyer&#8221; or &#8220;Huck Finn&#8221; to the effect that &#8220;Did you ever know a (n-word) that wouldn&rsquo;t lie?&#8221;<br/>
 Well, at least the investigation has begun, without the usual official hokum about &#8220;no evidence of a hate crime.&#8221; Now look for the Revs Jesse and Al to show up and lead some type of a march and protest blaming the whole incident on &#8220;white racism&#8221; or some other such poppycock.</p>

					<p>Look out, here come da bosses, Jesse and Al.  They&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this assault on those kids by that elderly couple and tht white woman.  It can&rsquo;t be a hate crime anyway, since the young students are all black.  Must be some mistake.  </p>

					<p>When you hear the typical yelling and shouting of Blacks, you&rsquo;re listening to people on the very edge of violence. No further progression of steps to settle something is  possible. The next very step is all but certain that violence will follow, and with their lower IQ and higher T-level the result is all but inevitable.</p>

					<p>So, what?  They don&rsquo;t count it as an incident if somebody doesn&rsquo;t die?  They are proud that the bus system hasn&rsquo;t had any murders, rapes or arson?  Hey, folks, look how good we are doing, and how safe you are on our busses?  I remember in MY town growing up, in my entire lifetime from age 5 through 20 my mother and I took the city busses everywhere.  There was not <span class="caps">ONE </span>crime, attack, robbery, altercation, rape, whatever during my entire lifetime on <span class="caps">ANY </span>bus at <span class="caps">ANY </span>time in all those years.  But then, we were a predominantly white area until the mayor invited in the Puerto Ricans as a &#8220;reliable and cheap labor force&#8221;.  <span class="caps">THEN </span>we started having some problems everywhere, even on busses.  Even in those neighborhoods that had some blacks, there might have been problems, but they never got out of hand.  Simple reason.  Blacks surrounded by overwhelming numbers of whites behave.  Or, at least, it used to be that way until the liberals indoctrinated them to believe their inherent criminality was the white man&rsquo;s fault, or an understandable reaction to &#8220;having been slaves&#8221;. Whites surrounded by overwhelming numbers of blacks are merely victims of choice when the blacks aren&rsquo;t preying upon themselves these days.  And when they move into a white neighborhood, crime does also.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the race, folks.  Not the neighborhood.  It&rsquo;s the <span class="caps">RACIAL </span>makeup of a neighborhood which determines how safe or criminal it is.  Can anybody deny that hard, obvious. statistically proven fact anymore?  </p>

					<p>I know 57 other posters will note this&hellip;but if the races were reversed here, there would be NO doubt whatever that this was racially motivated - whether it was or <span class="caps">NOT</span>!! Surely, this is the most naked racial double-standard of our age, which so many dutifully pretend not to notice. </p>

<p>This is the unfortunate reason why the &#8220;big brother surveillance society&#8221; might be halfway justified under our current circumstance.  If not for the cameras, authorities still might be pursuing the &#8220;she brandished a knife&#8221; lie.  Since the cameras probably don&rsquo;t have audio, the thugs will probably resort to the usual street thug <span class="caps">CYA </span>trick and claim that the white woman called them a racial slur.</p>

<p>This is very true. Many of the liberties being taken away from the law-abiding majority are being sacrificed in the name of &#8220;safety&#8221;  due to the actions of a small yet hostile segment of the population. Closed circuit monitoring, workstation monitoring and audible surveillance of phone systems is now a reality most of us have come to accept in any corporate workplace. It&rsquo;s moved into the public sector, and now our every move is watched on buses, airports and shopping malls. </p>
<p>But do these measures prevent these impulsive thugs from acting out their primitive tribal instincts? Apparently not. These intrusions into our daily lives do not protect us; they only provide footage to promote media coverage and discussion on the Internet. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to survive, maybe it will serve as evidence against your attackers, if they&rsquo;re even caught.</p>

(No doubt these black middle school students who attacked the white female bus passenger had been thoroughly indoctrinated at their public school in hate-whitey propaganda.) I guess this is an example of the &ldquo;WHITE <span class="caps">SKIN PRIVILEGE</span>&rdquo; we hear so much about.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another incident that <span class="caps">JUST </span>occurred: In New York, a white male subway train rider minding his own business is harassed and then physically attacked by a gang of black females:<br/>

<p>Earlier this year in Dubuque Iowa black students declared a certain bus stop &#8220;blacks only&#8221; and viciously beat any white student who tried to wait for a bus there. (This news story was linked on AmRen a few months ago. <span class="caps">BTW</span> Remember a couple decades ago the city fathers had bemoaned the absence of a black population in Dubuque and embarked on using taxpayer funds to encourage blacks to flood this community? Well today they are enjoying the fruits of that effort.)</p>
<p>Racial attacks by black racists on whites is a regular feature on public transportation systems now for <span class="caps">DECADES </span>in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Rarely is it <span class="caps">EVER </span>reported. Bernie Getz, after yet one more vicious attack by black youths as he rode the New York subway that sent him to the hospital with permanent injuries, finally had enough and <span class="caps">ASSERTED HIS RIGHT </span>to use the public transportation system, and defended himself from a gang of black youths who&rsquo;d surrounded him with sharpened screwdrivers demanding money. He was railroaded by the New York judicial system for daring to defend his civil rights. But he found out that if you are white in America <span class="caps">YOU HAVE</span> NO <span class="caps">RIGHTS</span>: You are a <span class="caps">SECOND CLASS CITIZEN.</span><br/>

					<p>&#8220;Police said no evidence had been found to back up the claims of suspects&rsquo; parents that Kreager or Ellis had provoked the incident by spitting or displaying a knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dumb violent criminal kids = dumb lying probably criminal parents. </p>
<p>Many normal(non-black) parents that I know want their kids to be ethical, be law abiding, do well in school, and be respectful towards others. Everytime there is any crime or crimes committed by a black person, their friends and family are the first to lie for them. No wonder their society is totally messed up. If the parents shield the criminal and violent kids, the kids figure they have no retraints on their behavior. &#8220;Ma kid dint rape his 8 day old daughter it be all a conspiracy again&rsquo; black men, he be a good boy!! He jus does a litl drugs or deal now n then, he no crackheeeaaad&#8221; <br/>
This is not civilized. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of white/asian parents turning in their own children for shameful criminal behavior. Some even disown their own children that commit horrific crimes and hang their head in shame in public. This is civilized. </p>

					<p>They arent even very good liars. The idea of a 26 year old woman brandishing a knife and spitting at a bunch of black kids is so ludicrous that not even Al Sharpton would buy it. They should have played the race card and said that she racially abused them; if they had then by now she would probably be in custody. Why invent new, improbable lies when the old one works so well? If it aint broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</p>

If not for the cameras, authorities still might be pursuing the &ldquo;she brandished a knife&rdquo; lie.

<p>I wonder how many of these attacks are orchestrated by some unseen hand against us for the specific purpose of creating an Orwellian society.  Gun control, biased &#8220;hate&#8221; laws and intrusion into privacy are the goal.  </p>

					<p>I used to fight for immigration reform but now I see the light just as Trent Lott did.  Hispanics are making big gains on the economic and political ladder.  I have not doubt they will surpass blacks leaving them on the bottom of society.  As they move up into middle class status the service jobs they used to do will once again be the staple employment for blacks.  It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say they will return to the fields.  I just hope I&rsquo;m alive to see it.  All this black on White violence is a drop in the bucket compared to black/hispanic violence that will escalate in the coming years.  A black walking to the corner store to buy malt liquor becomes &#8220;challenging&#8221;.  </p>

					<p>It seems everytime we turn around there are new ugly stories of Black on White crime that the news media only breifly touches on. Just look at the crimes we have witnessed over the last couple years usually involving packs of Blacks ganging up on Whites.  Three young white girls ganged up on, and chased by a horde of blacks while playing basketball in New Jersey. Then, there were the three young white girls in Long Beach, who were visiciously beaten on Halloween night in their own neighborhood, by blacks visiting from the other side of town. The young White couple carjacked, beaten, raped, totured, then brutally murdered by 4 or 5 armed blacks. The 12 year old white girl who&rsquo;s home was invaded by blacks, who shot and killed her after robbing her house. The Jena six victim. And now this! And here with all the their racially based violence, they invite the media to hear them complain that blacks are being targeted and, ethnically cleansed by Hispanics.  Hispanic on Black crime does not begin to begin to compare with the level of Black on White crime. But racial violence is only important when <span class="caps">THEY </span>are the victims.</p>

					<p> We hear the terms White privilege, and Black oppression, more today than at any other time in history. The irony is, today it is whites who are oppressed. Blacks can literally get away with any crimes against whites these days, without them being considered race attacks or a hate crimes, much less being convicted. While all blacks need to do is say they were the victims of white violence, such as with the Duke episode, and instantly our biased media brands Whites as guilty before ever having their day it court. Whites can even be accused of hate crime over ropes and nooses, even when they are planted. Now Blacks are pushing to make it a felony. Now I ask you, which race is privileged today, and which one is oppressed? </p>

					<p>One of the things that strikes me about black assaults is their ferocity. When you see whites fighting, it is usually a few punches, and then it&rsquo;s over. When blacks start to beat someone up (often in a group) there seems to be something frenzied and wild about it. It&rsquo;s like they are not in control of what they are doing. I have read so many stories about them continually kicking and stomping on someone after they have gone unconscious. White people rarely do this. It would be interesting to see some stats/facts about the extent of injuries inflicted by different races..although I doubt such info is readily available, and would only confirm what I already suspect. When races are this different it makes a mockery of having a justice system designed for all. If the young blacks were to argue &#8216;I couldnt help it&rsquo;, could you disagree?<br/>
There was a story in the Daily Mail today about a racist murder in London by two black men. I went on the site to add a link, and they have taken it off (they often only leave such stories on for a few hours) but no matter, because there was another one to take its place. </p>

					<p>Well, well, well  </p>
<p>This does not surprise me.  If the Baltimore <span class="caps">MTA </span>is like every other <span class="caps">MTA </span>in the country it is a 99 percent black organization.  I assume that one or more of the thugs are related to, or perhaps even the child of, an affirmative action <span class="caps">MTA </span>employee.  So now there will be no video.  The thugs will claim she say the N-word.  The all black jury will let the thugs off.</p>
<p>Then the black DA will charge the White victims with hate crime for daring to be involved in a situation where members of the protected, privileged, aristocratic class had to spend a few hours in a police station.</p>
<p>Or maybe the <span class="caps">ADL </span>and Weisenthal Center are already at work to get the thugs off as they exonerated the thugs guilty of last Halloween&rsquo;s racialy motivated beaten of 2 young White women in Long Beach Ca.</p>
<p>Video Of Bus Beating Reported Blank<br/>
Monday, December 10, 2007<br/><br/>
<span class="caps">WBAL</span> Radio and The Baltimore Examiner   wbal.com </p>
<p>There is a report this morning that police investigating last week&rsquo;s beating of a woman aboard an <span class="caps">MTA </span>bus don&rsquo;t have any video of the beating. </p>
<p>The Baltimore Examiner reports that while police believed the beating was caught by the bus&rsquo;s on-board video camera, that tape appears to be blank. </p>
<p>The Examiner quotes a source close to the investigation who says the camera wasn&rsquo;t working properly and the paper reports <span class="caps">MTA </span>police are sending the video to specialists, hoping they can find something on the tape that&rsquo;s not visible to the naked eye.<br/>

					<p> &#8220;Of course, there probably won&rsquo;t be any pics of the &lsquo;misguided&rsquo; and &lsquo;oppressed by Institutional Racism&rsquo; &lsquo;yutes&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Gee wiz, I thought those darn Yoots were a Danish tribe who were once pestering the British.  Now they&rsquo;re terrorizing people on American buses.  Just can&rsquo;t get it out of their blood, can they? They should all go back to Yootland where they came from!</p>

					<p>yes, another terrible racial hate crime against our people, again White women alone - the violent Black criminals are terrible cowards, they only fight when they have 9-1 odds or are attacking our women, elderly people, small, low weight students like the Jena attempted murder.  </p>
<p>Now what to do.</p>
<p>Put together you own contact lists of local - <span class="caps">LOCAL </span>media, elected officials and their staffs. Don&rsquo;t try to go to the top of the top and contact the <span class="caps">CEO </span>of Time Warner Inc. <span class="caps">CBS </span>or some US Senator to listen to your complaint that they are ignoring White victims of racist attacks. Instead cultivate, get to know local people and educate them about the situation - pass on articles about real events and ask if they would consider getting out of the <span class="caps">MSM </span>blackout on real hate crimes.</p>
<p>Be polite and be persistent and knowledge is power. There should be accurate lists, contact information of non White thugs, criminals who think they are getting away with brutal racist attacks on our women and children. Justice can catch up with people later on.</p>
<p>Be patient and strong don&rsquo;t give in to despair and hopeless. This is war, in war we suffer casualties. Look how many casualties the Russians and Ukrainians suffered under Communism and World War <span class="caps">II.</span> WHites are still alive there and coming back strong. We must do the same in places in and around Baltimore, Jena <span class="caps">LA. </span>etc.</p>
<p>Please no whining that the <span class="caps">MSM </span>&#8220;isn&rsquo;t fair&#8221; - duhhh.</p>

					<p>Anywhere this could&rsquo;ve happened those &#8220;kids&#8221; would get a free pass. Remember the subway shooter, what t was his name ? Bernard Getz or something like that ? My ex-wife got shot at by an off duty St.Louis city cop (Black) who was trying to get her into his car.  He claimed she called him a N-word.  How dare a White woman reject the advances of some black thug!!! The guy was carrying a stolen gun and he didn&rsquo;t even lose his job. </p>

					<p>Stop calling for the lynching of these kids. They made a mistake and now is the time for healing. Even good kids mess up now and then. There&rsquo;s no need to ruin these kid&rsquo;s lives forever over something this minor. I marched in Jena, and I hope we don&rsquo;t have another Jena on our hands here.</p>

					<p>As a white male, I encounted endless harassment from young, out of control black shool children. And what could I do about it?Wanna know what I did about it, I moved to Indianapolis. I will always love Baltimore, but stories like stories like these just remind me of why I got the hell out of there!</p>

					<p>This type of incident is typical behavior in a Baltimore City middle school. If you do not believe me, just visit one on any given day. The entire <span class="caps">DJS </span>system needs to be overhauled as our schools are really holding cells during the day, not institutions of education.</p>

					<p>As a blackman,who rode the buses in baltimore,working people always dread the idea of riding buses when the school kids get out of school, there have been times were I feared for the driver of the bus due to the lack of control these children show.</p>

					<p>Here comes the Al Sharpton protest wagon. I am sure it was totally the white lady&rsquo;s fault, I mean how could she do such a thing, I am sure she had a noose or Confederate flag hidden somewhere in her purse. Those poor black kids are just being unfairly targeted. I definitely smell racism here. It should be their constitutional right to beat any white person as savagely as they&rsquo;d like and get thousands of protesters on their side to boot. </p>
<p>I am also sure the elderly white man was very racist in the past so she deserved it too. How dare these white people go and be white in public, bitch should have know better. I was white one time in an Oakland public administration building, I know I deserved all the hard looks and gum smacking those affirmative action ladies gave me. I should have known better also, how could I have been so short sighted to know that being white in public would cause such problems for those poor black public servants. Funny thing is, it isn&rsquo;t that far from the truth. Funny? No, scary.</p>

					<p>&#8220;&hellip;no evidence that the severe beating of a 26-year-old woman on a city bus this week was provoked..&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, &#8216;cause we know how white women just love to go around provoking young black males.</p>

					<p>It is well known that black women, when sexually aroused (see the works of Rushton for example) are very sexually passionate and insatiable.<br/>
As we can see from this case, black women also display levels of physical aggression most usually found in males of other races.<br/><br/>
The link is of course the male sex hormone testosterone, which apart from regualting the libido in both sexes is also the seat of physical aggression - the two &#8216;passions&rsquo; libido and aggression are two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care. Let the blacks do whatever they want to each other as long as it doesn&rsquo;t bother other law abiding races. I have no desire to overhaul anything, let&rsquo;s invest more money into other higher performing white/asian students. They really deserve our attention!!</p>

<p>You tell &#8216;em brother. We&rsquo;re busy ruining a whole country here. Busy, I say. There&rsquo;s no time to quibble over small matters when there&rsquo;s so much more work to be done.</p>

					<p>Fairness sounds so, well, <span class="caps">FAIR, </span>until a person sees how blacks continually behave in grossly unfair and uncivilized ways as a group. The white liberal bleeding hearts usually are well-to-do and they often live in gated communities. Not only is that hypocritical, it is dangerous because they are not able to assess firsthand the reality that is an avalanche of black misbehaviors (by now, so well documented that to refute it is like saying the earth is flat!).</p>
