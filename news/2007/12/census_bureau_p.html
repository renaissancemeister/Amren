						<p>As our nation prepares to ring in the new year, the U.S. Census Bureau today projected the Jan. 1, 2008, population will be 303,146,284 &mdash; up 2,842,103 or 0.9 percent from New Year&rsquo;s Day 2007.</p>
<p>In January, the United States is expected to register one birth every eight seconds and one death every 11 seconds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, net international migration is expected to add one person every 30 seconds. The result is an increase in the total U.S. population of one person every 13 seconds.<br>

			<p>We need a &#8220;TIMEOUT&#8221; on all immigration,legal and ILLEGAL. We need to start deporting ALL ILLEGALS period.</p>

			<p>At 303 million as the US total population with whites at approximately 198 million, we are now officially at about 65.3% of our country&rsquo;s population. This to me is appalling, since we no longer are even 2/3rds of the population; we are in effect, well beyond the point of sustainable minority placating, since that would be 70% or higher. Now, let us become even more morbid in our outlook as we realize that with anywhere from 10 to 25 million worthless illegal invaders in this land, we are really only about between 63.3% and 60.4% of the population. </p>
<p>Way to go Curious George and Comrade Bubba!</p>
<p>In your arrogance and stupidity, you have managed to move your country to the brink of destruction, for some heinously held neo mythology that was brought about by moral decay and drug ingestion by yourselves and your utterly contemptible peers. You both, will go down in the history books as being two of the greatest traitors this country has ever breed. Only the vile Red Rosenbergs come close, to comparing to your calculated &ldquo;deconstruction&rdquo; of this nation&rsquo;s: people, culture, industry, and sociopolitical stability.</p>
<p>However, you are far worse than the Rosenbergs, since neither of those Reds ever swore an oath before God to defend and protect our country and constitution. Heck, Benedict Arnold probably wouldn&rsquo;t even spit on you two, that is how low your treason is!</p>
<p>Neither of you two swine will likely ever get the treason trials and executions you deserve, but you will have to face God on your respective judgment days. </p>
<p>May he have only as much mercy on you, as you both did on your own people, and their safety and security. In other words, I hope both of you worthless and treacherous jackasses land next to Hitler, Mao, and Stalin in the Hades Hilton!</p>

			<p>The U.S. receives an immigrant every 30 seconds&hellip; .</p>
<p>Which probably translates to the U.S. experiences an immigrant perpetrated crime at least once every 30 minutes&hellip; . and at least one demand for welfare or government-funded FREE healthcare every five minutes.</p>
<p>And still the  Mexicans can&rsquo;t understand WHY we want them driven out and our borders sealed airtight.</p>

			<p>The Census doesn&rsquo;t ask a person if they are a citizen.  The twenty million (plus) illegals are counted in that total.  The actual US citizen population is around 280,000,000.  Unless the brakes are put on immigration and illegals deported, you can expect a half billion by 2050.  </p>
<p>Today the Census also released information that they are expecting a mass migration of retirees to the Rocky Mountain states.  It seems they&rsquo;re abandoning traditional retirement havens like Florida and Arizona.  In 20 years, Wyoming will rank No 3 in the number of people over 65 with Montana coming in at No 5.  Reasons cited for moving to the area were less congestion, clean air and lower crime.  It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that race plays a big part in this migration.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;The result is an increase in the total U.S. population of one person every 13 seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the result from that is a country that&rsquo;s seriously tribalized, overpopulated, on the brink of major civil upheaval, with severely declining resources.</p>
<p>Mark my words.  Water and food scarcity will be major issues for this country and the rest of the world, FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.</p>

			<p>303,146,284 that we know of&hellip;  Somehow I just can&rsquo;t quite believe this!  </p>
<p>Our government keeps saying that we have 12 million illegal aliens in this country.  What is it about the number 12 million?  Is it some sort of a magical number?  Why has this number stayed the same for at least the past two years?  Give me a break!  We&rsquo;re not looking at 12 million illegal aliens in this country anymore; we&rsquo;re looking at close to 40 million illegal aliens.  So why should I trust this number 303,146,284?</p>
<p>Also, if this low-ball number of 303,146,284 is to be believed, lucky us!  Just wonderful&hellip;  More traffic, more congestion, more smog&hellip;  More drugs, more gangs, more crime&hellip;  Less land, less water, less natural resources&hellip;  Less social services, less peace, less quality of life&hellip;  More overflowing schools, hospitals and prisons&hellip;  More taxes for us to pay to support all of these &#8220;low-income newcomers&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Our &#8220;globalist elite&#8221; government is flushing us down the toilet, so I&rsquo;m GLAD that We the People are standing up and fighting for our rights!  Our position is snowballing more and more each day, and it&rsquo;s about time!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Census Bureau today projected the Jan. 1, 2008, population will be 303,146,284&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The US population is, in reality, most likely closer to 330+ million.</p>
<p>And despite the wishes of many and the insistence of others, Whites are already at around 51% of the population of America, not 66%.</p>
<p>At current growth rates, whites will be 49% of the population of America in less than 33 months.</p>
<p>In as little as ten years, whites may only account for around 39% of the US population&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;from the Heritage Foundation on May 15, 2006 in regards to the attempted Amnesty (which is happening anyway),</p>
<p>&#8220;If enacted, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act (CIRA, S.2611) would be the most dramatic change in immigration law in 80 years, allowing an estimated 103 million persons to legally immigrate to the U.S. over the next 20 years&hellip;The figure of 103 million legal immigrants is a reasonable estimate of the actual immigration inflow under the bill and not the maximum number that would be legally permitted to enter. The maximum number that could legally enter would be almost 200 million over twenty years.&#8221;<br>

<p>And let us not forget those high fertility rates of the immigrants who are already here&hellip;</p>

			<p>All of the U.S. immigration laws have been written by the democrats, I believe the past 11 or so were authored by Ted Kennedy, the sheer numbers are staggering, but the type of immigrant coming here is the most astounding part of the situation, the chance that an educated white European would become an immigrant is miniscule, even the asian immigrants to the U.S. are of the uneducated class, of course we all know what the majority if immigrants who come here are, we can all see them standing on street corner in the barrio, trying to decide whether to wait on their welfare check or rob someone. Vote Democrat and we&rsquo;ll get even more of this.</p>

<p>I beg to differ.  While traitor Bush is indeed instrumental in this Mexican invasion travesty, it is the traitors in congress who are the primary culprits and they are joined by countless seditious mayors and governors.  Treason is the highest paying enterprise in America today and most of our politicians are all standing in line to receive their pay-offs. <br>

			<p>&#8220;We ought to be opening up our borders to skilled labor from all parts of the world because if we were to do that we would increase the supply of skilled workers that our schools have been unable to create and as a consequence of that we would lower the average wage of skills and reduce the degree of income inequality in this country.&#8221;<br>

			<p>The government attempts to deceive us, by counting mestizos as White. I worked for the Census bureau during the 2000 survey, and I could not believe the arrogance/ignorance of the government in allowing obviously non-White mestizos to be counted as Whites; the goal being to keep the invasion less obvious.</p>

			<p>My wife and I are White citizens of the United States. We are both of Northern European ancestry. </p>
<p>The crux of this story is precisely why we purposefully chose to never have children. We will die someday knowing that we are not leaving a part of ourselves behind for the world that lies ahead. I rest easy knowing our decision was correct.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Profits trump culture. What does that mean? It means that a few very wealthy Whites have ruined civilization by polluting it with undesirables for the purpose of having (a) cheap manual labor, (b) easily placated buyers of low intelligence, and (c) a gullible populace.</p>
<p>My wife and I do not fit their model.</p>

			<p>JJ Björnsson:  You forgot to mention that the Census Bureau also currently uses the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; classifications as the new national population benchmark.  This is unprecedented and unacceptable.  In their treasonous eyes our nation is now comprised of &#8220;fill in the race&#8221; Hispanics or &#8220;fill in the race&#8221; non-Hispanics.       </p>

			<p>Whites have been a minority in my area for at least a decade now. It is no longer safe to send white children to public schools here. Whites have been driven out of thier old neighborhoods and the only way to ensure you won&rsquo;t have to live next to blacks is to buy at least 5 acres of land in a rural area. I do most of my shopping early in the morning while most of the blacks are still in bed because walking into a grocery store in the evening now is like going to a third world country. </p>

			<p>The politicians who promote massive immigration do so because on their six  plus figure incomes their own personal lifestyles are comfortable, and they dont care at all about all of the lower paid working stiffs who pay taxes to support their comfy lifestyles.And worst of all, they dont care about the hell they are creating for the future generations, which will include any of their decendants. </p>

			<p>&#8220;And still the Mexicans can&rsquo;t understand WHY we want them driven out and our borders sealed airtight.&#8221; (Posted by Fed Up at 7:46 PM on December 28).</p>
<p>If you ask them how they&rsquo;d like an army of Americans arriving in their own native villages or towns (without money), I think that would often compute.</p>
<p>I was with a mexicana in Puerto Vallarta who was complaining about American racism, and getting angrier and angrier about Americans in general, and said that when she returned to visit Tijauna where she had lived years ago, it was full of Americans, that she &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t even buy a taco, it was hot dogs and hamburgers everywhere  &mdash;  why do Americans have to invade our country, why can&rsquo;t they just stay in their own country?!!&#8221;</p>
<p>I replied, &#8220;How do you think the people in San Diego feel? They have a way of life also, that they don&rsquo;t like to see disappearing.&#8221; </p>
<p>It took this fairly intelligent mexicana a few moments to readjust her mind to accommodate this strange way of looking at the matter.</p>
<p>They feel entitled, and they also think we don&rsquo;t really have a way of life, in the way that they do. </p>
<p>In any case, if they all end up back in their villages and towns on short rations, no argument is going to make them understand anything.</p>
<p>The idea of having a culture to protect, an idea so common here on Amren (and instinctive to Mexicans, when it comes to their own culture), is foreign to most white Americans, and probably sounds racist to them. EVERYthing sounds racist to them!</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t think of one single reason the United States needs any more immigration. What population does the U.S.A. need? 400 million? 500 million? 600 million? If so, WHY? Why do we need more people? What for? How and why is a population of 400 million &#8220;better&#8221; then one of 300 million? The U.S. now has a population FIVE TIMES the size of France, one of the largest countries of Europe. What do we NEED more people for?</p>

<p>This is the same government&rsquo;s take on population that claims that there are only 12 million illegals here; given that the true figure is more like 30 million, that would make &#8220;net international migration expected to add one person every&#8221; 10 seconds, not every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Since the overwhelming majority of immigrants, both legal and illegal, are non-white and since white birth rates are sustainable or less(2.3 or less per white woman of childbearing age), ALL population growth today and in the forseeable future will be non-white immigrants.  Thus, what is needed immediately is a total cessation of all immigration NOW  &mdash;  after that internal enforcement could do a great deal to reduce the current 30 million non-white illegals.</p>
<p>If we continue on our current path we will have a population of nearly one half a billion by mid century and the entire increase will be due to non-white immigration.  The numbers here are not subject to interpretation  &mdash;  they are very solid.  So any politician who is satisfied with the status quo is endorsing the extinction of whites in America as a minority white population is hardly a workable solution(just as workable as it has proven to be in Zimbabwe and South Africa).  Think about that for a moment when going to the voting booth next election  &mdash;  any politician who just keeps his/her mouth shut is endorsing our extinction.  This is one area in which it is literally true that you are either for or against us; there is no middle ground and has not been for some time.</p>

			<p>Those responsible for immigration in this nation are utter traitors. Traitors to the environment, traitors to crime prevention, traitors to every type of social problem that exists when overpopulation is at issue. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who they are, ethnic lobbies, special interest groups, churches, etc. all traitors.</p>

&gt; I guess that depends upon which God they stand before.  It might be you standing before God in negative judgement.  I never read in the Bible that preservatoin of any race or even people, not even those unfortunate Chosen Ones were guaranteed any special survival privileges.  In fact, that God seems to favor wiping nearly everyone out every once in a while.  Since it must be all part of God&rsquo;s plan, as I was always told, I guess we should just buck up, and get ready for the ride to martyrdom!</p>

Like the &#8220;white couple of Northern European ancestry&#8221; in the earlier comments I want to have NOTHING with leaving my genes to be diluted and eventually wiped out by miscegenation!

<p>It is the Walmarts, Home Depots, etc. that are driving this treason.  The complete list of the treasonous corporations can be found via the URL below. They don&rsquo;t see people as &#8220;immigrants&#8221;; they only see them as &#8220;consumers&#8221; and if we allow it they will pack billions of aliens into our country in order to enhance their bottom line.  Those who place profit above country are called traitors and these corporate traitors and their proxies in congress must be brought to justice&hellip;</p>

that I would strongly recommend for everyone concerned with making our country weaker and weaker by giving it piece by piece to our competitors, adversaries and outright enemies.

			<p>Whiteplight- there is only one God and I understand Johns comments.  He is upset like a lot of us and just shows it on the forum.  God blessed the US for years because of their commitment to him.  With the current trend from the sorry CEO&rsquo;s we have had, we are on the road to destruction.  No where in history has multi-cultures existed, because it DOES NOT WORK!  The rich whites from the white majority is commiting suicide by allowing these things to happen.  Only the decisions of a few are going to bring down the country of many.  What a shame.</p>

A newly formed &ldquo;North American Competitiveness Council&rdquo; composed of 10 leading corporate CEOs from each country, has been directing the SPP process to ensure that &ldquo;governments look to the private sector to tell them what needs to be done.&rdquo; Among the firms represented are Lockheed Martin, Wal-Mart, Exxon, General Motors, Home Depot, GE, Ford, Merck and Chevron.

<p>You must be joking. If not, you need to face reality, my friend. The ship is sinking. Knowing this, why would you bring your children aboard and leave them behind for what awaits? That would be illogical.</p>
<p>By the same token, exactly what favor would we be doing for our unborn children by bringing them into this world? Do you think they would enjoy listening to and experiencing a lifetime of egalitarian nonsense while living in our &#8220;diversified utopia&#8221;; one without a single heritage and cultural identity? We did our children the greatest favor possible, with much love, by leaving them non-conceived and unborn.</p>
<p>We are completely comfortable with the logic of our decision. We are happy knowing that our unborn children will never have to experience any egalitarian browbeating while awash in a flood of undesirables, not to mention the outright betrayal by our own kind. Fortunately, we do we have to worry about the unsavory and self-serving decisions the government makes on our behalf.</p>
<p>We are not alone in our views. Intelligent people know better than to have children under these conditions.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t think of one single reason the United States needs any more immigration. What population does the U.S.A. need? 400 million? 500 million? 600 million? If so, WHY? Why do we need more people? What for? How and why is a population of 400 million &ldquo;better&rdquo; then one of 300 million? The U.S. now has a population FIVE TIMES the size of France, one of the largest countries of Europe. What do we NEED more people for?</p>
<p>I think it boils down to the fact that the government doesn&rsquo;t think it can compete in the long term with other countries with larger populations, militarily or economically.  There are some 342,956,265 males, age 18–49 available for military service in China.  That&rsquo;s more males than we have population.  China and the EU also have larger consumer markets.  </p>

<p>America has an arsenal of mass destruction capable of destroying all life on this planet many times over, so the superior numbers of our enemies count for nothing.  And Red China&rsquo;s larger consumer market is comprised almost entirely of peasant-class slaves who can barely afford to buy rice, so their numbers count for nothing.  Washington is focused on the wages of treason and cares nothing whatsoever about our inability to compete in the marketplace since it is they who are responsible for legislating the outsourcing of our manufacturing and jobs and the insourcing of our jobs that can&rsquo;t be outsourced&hellip;<br>

<p> Undoubtedly there is some truth to what you say. Some people have a mentality where bigger is always better. If two aspirins are good for a headache, then four must be twice as good and eight twice more still. In reality you very rapidly reach a point of diminishing returns. Which countries have a higher standard of living, India and China or Sweden and Switzerland? It is Quality of your country not numerical quantity that matters. But the mentality is always there.   </p>

True again.  But apparently in their optimistic view of  an ever-growing future, they&rsquo;ve failed to stop and consider that. </p>
<p>In the doctrine of absolute equality, all humans are the same and interchangeable.  Therefore, anything else cannot be considered as even a possibility because that would be heresy.</p>

			<p>If corporate America could convince Washington to usher in a half billion Red Chinese &#8220;consumers&#8221; and a half billion East Indian &#8220;consumers&#8221; this year they would do it in a heartbeat.  This would also create a massive labor surplus thereby enabling them to drive domestic wages ever lower.  These corporations have proved they have no reservations about destroying our sovereignty, demographics, and culture in their unrestrained pursuit of profits.  Our congress had turned its back on the American public and now serves these corporate traitors and no one else&hellip;  </p>

<p>I understand there are some religious groups which teach that none of this matters anyway. They believe that the earth is here to use and enjoy because it&rsquo;s all about to go up in flames soon in some sort of divine holocaust. So we better pollute it and use it up while we can.  </p>
<p>These groups are therefore very dangerous to all the rest of us who do not believe that kind of nonsense. They are very much like the cultists who all took poison and killed themselves to go and join the Hale Bopp comet in space, a couple of years ago.  Unfortunately, these types groups have big influence on our present government.   But what about the rest of us who are left here?  Well they say we&rsquo;re not &#8220;saved&#8221; so we don&rsquo;t count! <br>
