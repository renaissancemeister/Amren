<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>He is at the heart of a great culture war in Texas &mdash; and the nation, credited with bringing us prosperity and blamed for abusing our resources. How should we deal with this stranger among us?</p>
<p>He breaks the law by his very presence. He hustles to do hard work many Americans won&rsquo;t, at least not at the low wages he accepts. The American consumer economy depends on him. America as we have known it for generations may not survive him.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t seem to live with him and his family, and if we can live without him, nobody&rsquo;s figured out how. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the Illegal Immigrant, and he&rsquo;s the 2007 Dallas Morning News Texan of the Year &mdash; for better or for worse. Given the public mood, there seems to be little middle ground in debate over illegal immigrants. Spectacular fights over their presence broke out across Texas this year, adding to the national pressure cooker as only Texas can. </p>
<p>To their champions, illegal immigrants are decent, hardworking people who, like generations of European immigrants before them, just want to do better for their families and who contribute to America&rsquo;s prosperity. They must endure hatred and abuse by those of us who want the benefits of cheap labor but not the presence of illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>Especially here in Texas, his strong back and willing heart help form the cornerstone of our daily lives, in ways that many of us do not, or will not, see. The illegal immigrant is the waiter serving margaritas at our restaurant table, the cook preparing our enchiladas. He works grueling hours at a meatpacking plant, carving up carcasses of cattle for our barbecue (he also picks the lettuce for our burgers). He builds our houses and cuts our grass. She cleans our homes and takes care of our children. </p>
<p>Yet to those who want them sent home, illegal immigrants are essentially lawbreakers who violate the nation&rsquo;s borders. They use public resources &mdash; schools, hospitals &mdash; to which they aren&rsquo;t entitled and expect to be served in a foreign language. They&rsquo;re rapidly changing Texas neighborhoods, cities and culture, and not always for the better. Those who object get tagged as racists. </p>
<p>Whatever and whoever else the illegal immigrant is, everybody has felt the tidal wave of his presence. According to an analysis of government data by the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, Texas&rsquo; immigrant population has jumped a whopping 32.7 percent since 2000, a period in which immigration to the United States has exceeded, in sheer numbers, all previous historical eras. Half the immigrants in the state &mdash; 7 percent of all Texans &mdash; are estimated to be here illegally. </p>
<p>Though many would agree that the status quo cannot be sustained &mdash; more illegal immigrants arrive each year than legal ones, a sure sign that the system is a joke &mdash; neither Texas nor the nation seemed nearer in 2007 to resolving this complex crisis. We can&rsquo;t deport 12 million people who already live here, but we can&rsquo;t leave our back door open indefinitely. Compromise comes hard because the issue is tangled up with the most basic aspects of everyday life, down to the core of what it means to be American. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How Texas &mdash; and, by extension, the rest of America &mdash; reacts will be unlike how previous generations handled immigration, given how the nation has changed since the 1960s. Fair or not, core American culture and values have become a popular punching bag. Some have cheered that as refining the American character by embracing diversity, inclusiveness and empowerment of ethnic and other minorities. Others worry that America risks losing itself in the process, especially if it gives up on securing the borders. </p>
<p>Historians say that the distinctly American democratic and middle-class ideals grew out of a specific cultural tradition &mdash; the Anglo-Protestant. Changed slowly over time by immigrants from the world over, it&rsquo;s now challenged by a strong competing culture. </p>
<p>If critics are correct, we could be seeing the advent of the kind of fractiousness that bedevils public life in Canada and other nations where peoples who speak different languages, and come from different cultural backgrounds, live together only with mutual suspicion and unease. </p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps the alarmists are wrong. Maybe these ambitious, hard-working immigrants, whatever their documentation, will write the next great chapter of a story that&rsquo;s still deeply American, though with a different accent. If the optimists are right, much work remains to be done to incorporate all immigrants fully into new cultural traditions. </p>
<p>We end 2007 no closer to compromise on the issue than when the year began. People waging a culture war &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what the struggle over illegal immigration is &mdash; don&rsquo;t give up easily. What you think of the illegal immigrant says a lot about what you think of America, and what vision of her you are willing to defend. How we deal with the stranger among us says not only who we Americans are today but determines who we will become tomorrow. <br>

<p>&#8220;Following this &ldquo;logic&rdquo;, they should elect cheese cocaine (a highly addictive drug manufactured and smuggled from Mexico that Mexicans are very successfully marketing to American school children) a merchandise of the year. It&rsquo;s illegal, its relatively new, it&rsquo;s very popular (among school children), its sales generate $millions+ thus making the economy stronger, and so many people can say that they cannot imagine how could they function without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>    Point well taken. Just a small correction. This stuff they call &#8220;cheese&#8221; is actually extremely low grade heroin and not cocaine.<br>

			<p>As far as the democrat party is concerned, they are the Man of the Year, also they are prospective voters, as they collect their share of the American taxpayers money they become democrats. Illegal immigration is going to continue and escalate as long as democrats control congress, vote Republican, conservative Republican, try to vote as often as your democrat neighbor.</p>

			<p>I agree with some of the earlier posters who see benefit in such an outrageous article by bringing a very strong focus on illegal aliens at election time.<br>
John McCain is surging in the polls despite coupling with  Fat teddy kennedy in trying to pass an amnesty bill. McCain is now spinning his efforts to get an amnesty law by saying it was NOT an amnesty bill.   What do you call it when 20 million illegals are made legal without even closing the  back door they came in through?  Instead of president, a better job for McCain would be as a greeter at WalMart.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Every time I read that phrase, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t just deport 12 (or 20) million people&rdquo;, I want to challenge the liar&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican Government had no problem &#8220;deporting&#8221; 12 (or 20} Mexicans to our country! We can just reverse to process, no?</p>

			<p>I thought Joe Horn had a good shot at being &#8220;Texan of the Year.&#8221; (Not really, of course, but I like to dream).</p>
<p>If TOY had been by popular vote, I wonder how the vote for Mr. Horn would have compared to the vote for &#8220;the illegal immigrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still immensely pleased with the essay  &mdash;  I hope it ignites a firestorm of interest and editorial comment across the country, and appearances for the author, Rod Dreher, on TV shows. I urge everyone to read the original article, and note how many points are enumerated in it that are in our favor.</p>

			<p>One word: Democracy.  A referendum in Texas on the immigration issue is surely the solution.  Is that unconstitutional?  The problem is that liberals have always had an uneasy relationship with democracy because the masses don&rsquo;t generally share their views.  Liberals have seized control of Western civilisation and have been slowly eroding democracy for decades.  Unemployed men, childless professional women, mass immigration and feral youth - this is the legacy of liberalism, a worthy ideology which, unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t translate into reality since its opponent is Nature.   </p>

			<p>Enough of these damned lies!</p>
<p>The claim that Mexicans do jobs Americans won&rsquo;t take is ONLY because the greedy corporations refuse to pay a decent wage! The damned illegals can afford to work for those wages, knowing full well the American taxpayers will be forced to make up the differences in their low wages   &mdash;   With FREE healthcare, with welfare subsidy hand-outs, free schooling for their brood.</p>
<p>Everyone should take the time to FLOOD the Dallas Morning News with protests over this obscenity of an article!</p>

			<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;He breaks the law by his very presence. He hustles to do hard work many Americans won&rsquo;t, at least not at the low wages he accepts. The American consumer economy depends on him. America as we have known it for generations may not survive him.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t seem to live with him and his family, and if we can live without him, nobody&rsquo;s figured out how.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the amusing facets of this story is the way the media unwittingly treats minorities as children, rather than adult men and women. I&rsquo;ve observed similar behavior for years while watching collegiate and professional sports telecasts. When the commentators laud a good play by a minority, they take a tone of voice that one would take when commenting on good behavior from a four year old child.</p>
<p>If you listen, you will note the change in their vocal inflections when they discuss a minority player versus a White player. Their tone changes from normalcy to a false, patronizing cacophony of endless accolades and hyperbole.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Announcer 1: &#8220;What a *very* talented and *very* special receiver Hijuka Jones has emerged to become.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announce 2: (rushing to interject) &#8220;Yes, *very, very* special, Merv&hellip; and he&rsquo;s an incredible young man too. His coaches all beam and their eyes light up when they talk about him. He&rsquo;s one of the *very* best in the game today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announcer 1: &#8220;Ooooh, *absolutely*&hellip; The things he does on and off the field are simply nothing short of *AMAZING*.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announcer 2: &#8220;You know, after his rough start and his off-the-field problems that led to his criminal arrest charges last summer, a lot of people lost faith in this *very* special young man, but his head coach never did. He said he knew all along that he&rsquo;d overcome his adversity. Now, he&rsquo;s the first one to practice everyday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announcer 1: &#8220;Absolutely. What a *very* special story about a *very* special player. We expect to see many more great things out of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announcer 2: &#8220;Yes, indeed. *Very* much so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Of course, the way the media over-actively lauds the &#8220;contributions&#8221; of illegals to society is disturbingly similar.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that they do not intend to treat them like children, but their self-loathing and weak constitutions allow their comments to come out that way&hellip;and it&rsquo;s all quite predictable.<br>

			<p>Funny thing about the saintly illegals selflessly working on home construction here in Oklahoma, things start disappearing in the neighborhoods they work in. Construction equipment, personal property, even pets! Now that OK is shamelessly cracking down on these righteous souls, I&rsquo;m seeing quite a slowdown in progress on homes under construction&hellip; except for the home being built across the street. That builder refuses to use illegals and his crews were out bright and early this morning (Jan 1st) plugging away!</p>
<p>GOOD!!! A real American builder using real Americans willing to do jobs the MSM claims Americans won&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>&#8220;One word: Democracy. A referendum in Texas on the immigration issue is surely the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do we need to have a referendum to determine if other felonies should be permitted?</p>
<p>No, we do not need a referendum. What we need, instead, is for the government to enforce our nation&rsquo;s exisiting laws   &mdash;   period. Illegal immigration is a felony and for good reason.</p>
<p>Consider these facts: A few credit card companies successfully track billions of commerce transactions per day. Meanwhile, public schools successfully bus millions of children to and from school five days per week. At the same time, billions of products are distributed to stores across the country.</p>
<p>My point? Tasks that seem insurmountable seldom are. The idea of finding and deporting all illegal immigrants is very far from an insurmountable task. The government simply refuses to do it. I encourage you not to yield to their heinous actions by floating the idea of reaffirming existing laws.</p>

<p>It was great to see your post.  It was ironic as I was commented to my wife about the exact same thing as we were watching college football today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed how announcers talk about minority players.  Behavior that I take for granted are praised like the minority player just discovered time travel.</p>
<p>Today the two announcers were gloating over some black 20 year old player.  Despite his criminal past and his 2 kids he has kept his head up and now is the best practice player on the team and a joy to be around.  They just kept feeding off one another using the voice inflection people use when talking about a little kid.</p>
<p>They ended with the  &#8220;What a great future he has ahead of him.&#8221; line.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about YOU, but me, I so NO OTHER WAY, short of a revolution, to right the intolerable wrongs done to the American people, by our crooked politicians and the bloodsucking corporate CEOs.</p>
<p>But then, the politicians are owned/controlled by lobbyists   &mdash;   some fronting for big business, others working for OTHER countries than the U.S. of A. </p>
<p>That the CEOs will go to any lengths to preserve their outrageous salaries, perks, golden parachutes, while utterly reprehensible, is understandable. What boils me is the HOLD other nations have on OUR government officials. Think about it!</p>

But PLEASE, tell the DMN how we AMERICANS feel about these parasites and criminals, and equally important, WHY! Flood them with an avalanche of mail, faxes, and e-mail. Let them hear for themselves how we feel about those lies &#8220;doing jobs Americans won&rsquo;t take.&#8221; The crime, the animalistic lifestyle these &#8220;good people&#8221; practice when they get here. Their endless demands for free healthcare, welfare, etc.  (As to that malarky that illegals can&rsquo;t get welfare&hellip; it&rsquo;s the same tactic used to get jobs illegally&hellip; FORGED OR FALSIFIED DOCUMENTATION!<br>

<p>Reality - For Real: Those people DO owe lots and lots of taxes and our government doesn&rsquo;t seem to care just as long as YOU and I pay OUR taxes. I would venture to guess that many, many of these people work under the table for cash, thereby paying no taxes whatsoever. Then, to top it off, they send huge sums of this money back to the &#8220;homeland&#8221; thereby taking it out of our economy altogether. Oh yeah, all the while loathing America and Americans and bankrupting our schools and hospitals. For our government to allow all of this is nothing short of traitorous. Yes, it is possible to deport the illegals. (Notice I didn&rsquo;t say 12 million because I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the number is probably triple what they claim it is.) <br>

At the taxpayers expense and future they promote the ruination of a once great nation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;To their champions, illegal immigrants are decent, hardworking people who, like generations of European immigrants before them, just want to do better for their families and who contribute to America&rsquo;s prosperity.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, perhaps the alarmists are wrong. Maybe these ambitious, hard-working immigrants, whatever their documentation, will write the next great chapter of a story that&rsquo;s still deeply American, though with a different accent. If the optimists are right, much work remains to be done to incorporate all immigrants fully into new cultural traditions.&#8221; </p>
<p>These two excerpts from the article are the typical cliches we&rsquo;re offered, and everyone is familiar with them. </p>
<p>I thought it would be good to highlight them in this post.  Simply because I think that these are the kind of cliches the Pro-Immigration people just will not be able to use this time next year.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong.  And I am hardly interested in making a prediction so that I can say I was right.  A hell of a lot more is at stake than one person being right or wrong.</p>
<p>The point is that by this time next year the sort of behavior of Mexicans, that the MSM is willing to ignore, and that the rest of us are so concerned about, from child-rape to murder by drunk-driving, from assualt and battery to just plain murder, to the continued anihilation of their Black neighbors, and not just in LA, will become impossible to ignore or even filter through the MSM Spin Machine, without the MSM looking crazy themselves. </p>
<p>But old habits die hard.  </p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see. </p>

			<p>&#8220;To their champions, illegal immigrants are decent, hardworking people who, like generations of European immigrants before them, just want to do better for their families and who contribute to America&rsquo;s prosperity.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, perhaps the alarmists are wrong. Maybe these ambitious, hard-working immigrants, whatever their documentation, will write the next great chapter of a story that&rsquo;s still deeply American, though with a different accent. If the optimists are right, much work remains to be done to incorporate all immigrants fully into new cultural traditions.&#8221; </p>
<p>These two excerpts from the article are the typical cliches we&rsquo;re offered, and everyone is familiar with them. </p>
<p>I thought it would be good to highlight them in this post.  Simply because I think that these are the kind of cliches the Pro-Immigration people just will not be able to use this time next year.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong.  And I am hardly interested in making a prediction so that I can say I was right.  A hell of a lot more is at stake than one person being right or wrong.</p>
<p>The point is that by this time next year the sort of behavior of Mexicans, that the MSM is willing to ignore, and that the rest of us are so concerned about, from child-rape to murder by drunk-driving, from assualt and battery to just plain murder, to the continued anihilation of their Black neighbors, and not just in LA, will become impossible to ignore or even filter through the MSM Spin Machine, without the MSM looking crazy themselves. </p>
<p>For a more detailed look at the sort of thing I&rsquo;m talking about here look up&hellip;</p>
<p>Top Ten Reasons Why the US Should Not Marry Mexico<br>
By Brenda Walker</p>
<p><br>
Hopefully everyone will get the picture sooner than later.  </p>
<p>But old habits die hard.  </p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see. </p>
<p>Still, anyone on either side of this fence who actually believes that the Pro-immigration people are acting out of a genuine love for things Mexican is out of their mind.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t deport 12 million people.&rdquo;    &mdash;    &mdash;    Reality: If those 12 million people owed back taxes to the IRS the 12 million people would&rsquo;ve been found AND deported the same week! Posted by Ms Taletha at 10:41 AM on January 2 &#8220;</p>
<p>Excellent, perceptive point by Ms Taletha!  As I mentioned before, some of the most brilliant, devastating points made by readers here are short and to-the-point gems.</p>

<p>Well, you can always move to Taxes- the new name for the North American Union.  Much bigger than Texas&hellip; </p>

			<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t deport 12 million people who already live here, but we can&rsquo;t leave our back door open indefinitely.&#8221;</p>
<p>For school bussing we use every school day 485.000 school busses to transport 25 miljoen children to their indoctrination centers called public schools.</p>
<p>It is not that we cannot, the politicians dont want to give them a one way trip in those school busses to the southern border.<br>
The problem could be solved in one school vacation, like coming Easter, lets do it!</p>

			<p>In further support of our American people seeing Hispanics as a race of criminals and potential criminals&hellip; the mother charged in that Hanna Montana ticket fraud was Hispanic. A Patricia Ceballo. Bottom line being, even &#8220;Americanized&#8221; Hispanics can&rsquo;t seem to stop using every dirty trick or crime to get the freebies they so covet. Go figure, right?</p>

			<p>Dallas is a sanctuary city overrun with Mexican illegals.  The predominantly Hispanic city government has placed statues of Mexican folk heroes in public parks and the Dallas sheriff chief is an admitted lesbian and a proud Mexican.  The fact that their daily propaganda rag endorses Mexican illegals comes as no surprise&hellip;</p>
