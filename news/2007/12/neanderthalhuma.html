						<p>Did modern humans interbreed with Neanderthals and, if so, did the mating result in a half-human, half-Neanderthal hybrid?</p>
<p>The answer is possibly &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the interbreeding but &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the hybrid, according to the authors of a new study that is already making waves among anthropologists.</p>
<p>At the centre of the study, published online in the Journal of Human Evolution, and the current debate, is a 29,000 year old Romanian skull that is one of the oldest fossils in Europe with modern human features.</p>
<p>But those features aren&rsquo;t quite a perfect match with us, which has led some experts to suspect it was a cross between a Neanderthal and a modern human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not so, according to study leader Dr Katerina Harvati, a senior researcher in the Department of Human Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and adjunct associate professor of anthropology at the City University of New York Graduate School.</p>
<p>&#8220;It differs from living people only in subtle ways, and always well within the range of modern human variation,&#8221; says Harvati, who worked with the Max Planck Institute researcher Dr Philipp Gunz and Professor Dan Grigorescu, from the University of Bucharest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Comparing skulls</b></p>
<p>She and her team took detailed 3D measurements of the Romanian skull, called Cioclovina calvaria, and compared these with a similar head shape analysis of Neanderthals, modern humans and fossils of other hominids found in Europe, Africa and countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The researchers also studied animal hybrids and developed an unprecedented list of proposed criteria for evaluating whether or not a fossil specimen is a hybrid.</p>
<p>The criteria include: greater or much smaller size than the parental species, on average; evidence for developmental instability; possible occurrence of rare attributes, such as having extra teeth or bone joints; and possessing an intermediate shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cioclovina did not meet any of these criteria &mdash; a strong refutation of the hypothesis that it represents a hybrid,&#8221; Harvati says.</p>
<p><b>Single origin</b></p>
<p>The scientists support the &lsquo;single origin&rsquo; model of human evolution.</p>
<p>This holds that modern humans evolved between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago in a single location, mostly likely Africa, with subsequent migration displacing archaic hominid populations, including Neanderthals, around the world.</p>
<p>The researchers, however, do not rule out that interbreeding may have taken place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;[If it occurred] it was probably a rare event and the result was not significant in evolutionary terms.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Backing</b></p>
<p>Dr Ian Tattersall, curator in the Division of Anthropology of the American Museum of Natural History in New York says he is &#8220;thoroughly in agreement&#8221; with the new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strenuous search for a Neanderthal-modern human hybrid has yet to turn up any evidence of such a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Delson [Professor Eric Delson, chairman of the department of anthropology at Lehman College] adds that, when combined with recent genetic studies that have found &#8220;indications of low to nonexistent&#8221; levels of Neanderthal genetic imprinting on modern humans, the new findings lead &#8220;us to reject widespread hybridisation and thus a major influence of Neanderthals on later human populations in Europe&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a &#8216;contrarian&rsquo; skeptic on this one: I feel that Neanderthals contributed genetically to some degree [more than 25,000 years ago] to what we now know as the Caucasian race. It&rsquo;s just a hunch &hellip; and the genetic evidence may later bear this out; right now the genetic evidence is FAR too skimpy to be definitive either way. Neanderthals had big brains, fair skin and red hair  &mdash;  -and although that trait doesn&rsquo;t add up to a lineage, I still feel that too many &#8216;white&rsquo; traits simply aren&rsquo;t present in the rest of homo to account for the very distinctive looks of Europeans. So-called superficial racial traits must have extended substantially as far back as pre-archaic homo sapiens.</p>

			<p>Venom and flamethrower I hate to break this to you but it is pretty clear that Neanderthals were not simply another race.  They were a different species.  We need to come to terms with this and realize that, even if we accept that all of our ancestors came from Africa within the last 200,000 years, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that our differences are skin deep.  Humans adapt very quickly to changing conditions and 200,000 years is more than enough time to account for the differences we see today among the races - including behaviors.</p>

			<p>Ross and Rana clearly showed that Neanderthal and Homo Sapiens sapiens (HSS-white man) clearly are NOT inter-related, in their book, &#8220;Who was Adam?&#8221; a nice balanced look at science from neither the darwinian atheist evolutionary model, or the &#8216;We are all one race, the the human race&rsquo; model both the more rabid egalitarian Multiculturalists, and the &#8216;epsitemologically consistent&rsquo; ICR (Institute for &#8220;Creation Research&#8221;) crowd holds to.</p>
<p>All of it is fast becoming a house of cards, that neither the race-mixers of the Evangelical &#8216;convert everyone to Christianity&rsquo; crowd, or the &#8220;Miscegenation is the New Black chic&#8221; Crowd, with their &#8216;what can we do for Darfur?&rsquo; and &#8220;Designer babies&rsquo; of &#8216;rainbow hues&rsquo; that people our grocery store tabloids.</p>
<p>It seems that the Revealed Christian religion, Western science, and the  expanding study of the fossil record show, that the Almighty made Adam&rsquo;s race to &#8216;be ye separate&rsquo; from everything that went before, and from the remaining cross-bred species that still populated this planet, before HSS came along&hellip;..</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;This holds that modern humans evolved between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago in a single location, mostly likely Africa,&#8221; cracked me up. Thirty years ago, Leakey&rsquo;s &#8216;discovery&rsquo; of &#8220;Lucy&#8221; was PROOF positive we all are descended from apes out of Africa. NO discussion, no question. Two generations later, now the pundits say &#8216;Most likely&rsquo;&hellip;. HA!</p>
<p>Fascinating. The more they hope to find the &#8216;missing link,&rsquo; Whatever that &#8216;link&rsquo; is, that will link European/Caucasian/ Western Man with the other races/simioids they envision are our ancestors, all to avoid the verse, &#8220;Let us make man in OUR image,&#8221; the more it is denied them. Truly, &#8220;God laughs them to scorn.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Jewamongyou - this is a re-visitation to some report about 2.5-3 years ago that looked at the DNA basis for the disappearance of the Neanderthal. I wish I could share the name of the report, but I can&rsquo;t remember. Its interesting though how the &#8220;disappearance&#8221; occurred in what is now Austria-Germany and to what is now Europe. Europe&rsquo;s civilizations were the most technologically advanced. I don&rsquo;t think this is mere association but causation.</p>

			<p>The  lineage  that  reached  the  Homo  Sapiens plateau  some  160,000  YA  in East  Africa  is  the  parent  lineage  for  all  of  humanity.  But  contrary  to  what some  posters  are  implying, some members  of that  lineage  did  not  leave Africa  until  some  50,000  YA  &mdash;  only.  And  they  did  not  travel  only  to  Eurasia  but to  Australasia,  Melanesia(Fiji, New  Guinea, etc.)  passing  through  South  Asia  &mdash;  where  some  stayed.</p>
<p>The resaon  why the Neanderthals  are  seen  as  a  separate  species is  that  they  were  a  human  version  of  Homo Erectus  that  travelled  out  of  Africa  some 1 million  years  ago.  They  were  human  because they  had  language, buried their  dead  and  created  technology.  But  they  are  back.  I have seen  them  in  that  Geico  commercial.</p>
<p>I  doubt  that  they  were  killed off  by  anyone  because  they  slowly  faded  away  over a  15,000  year  period.  Perhaps it   was  some  virus  or  other.  After  all,  Eurasia at  that  time  was vastly  underpopulated  and  was  bountiful  in  fruit  and  wild  game.</p>

			<p>To Action Potential:</p>
<p>What you suggest is unlikely if not impossible.</p>
<p>From what I have read the Neanderthal line separated from homo sapiens approxmately 400,000 years ago.  Versus the current separation for the various races being around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Even if there are similar traits this could easily be explained by what&rsquo;s called analogous evolution.  For example bats and insects fly even though they are evoultionarily speaking far apart.  This isn&rsquo;t because bats and insects have the same genes for wings, its because different genes in bats and insects produce the same effect: flight.</p>
<p>Now on the other hand whales have flippers and humans have hands.  This is homologous evoltution because these structures are a result of the same genes.</p>

<p><br>
This sounds like the way physical Anthropologists determine the race of a skeleton today. But, I thought we were &#8220;all the same&#8221;.</p>

			<p>OK, folks. Nothing is &#8216;clear&rsquo;  &mdash;  -merely well exposited. Too early to say. We are speculating, and that&rsquo;ll have to do and be acknowledged for the time being. DNA analysis is expanding rapidly, and the sample sources of ancient Neanderthal DNA are extremely narrow in scope. It&rsquo;s a tantalizing subject, yet either way, we didn&rsquo;t get where we are from some noble plan or behavior on the part of our forebears. Things have been far more random and rough-and-tumble than our sanctimonious selves would wish to think.</p>

			<p>      Occam: a Human version of Homo Erectus? That is very fuzzy<br>
and it assumes the point that is in question. Better sharpen that<br>
razor before you make yourself bleed.</p>

			<p>Hello Yellow Man: I can very well imagine that Neanderthals separated as far back  &mdash;  -or even much further  &mdash;  -than you say. I agree wholeheartedly with you on the prospect of analogous or convergent evolution; in fact, the red hair allele [of Neanderthal] is now seen as just that. Even so, I am suggesting that some of the N. genome got subsumed into the main homo sapiens line through sporadic &#8216;hybridization.&rsquo; Again, the whole available N. genome under study is simply too minuscule for one to make a determination right now: I don&rsquo;t care who wrote a book and did excellent, scientifically, and methodologically sound research.</p>
