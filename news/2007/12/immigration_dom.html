<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>Two decades after he left his native Mexico and eight years after he moved to Iowa, Jose Castillo is tired of being a scapegoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not terrorists,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are not murderers. We are not bad people. A lot of innocent people are being blamed for things just because they&rsquo;re Mexican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo, a parish worker at St. Mary&rsquo;s Catholic Church who says he came to America legally, personifies a demographic earthquake that is reshaping Iowa&rsquo;s culture and politics and shaking up the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Hundreds of miles from the Mexican border, Iowans find themselves on the front line of the bruising national debate over immigration policy.</p>
<p>Running hard toward next week&rsquo;s kickoff presidential caucuses, candidates, especially the Republicans, have seized upon the issue to energize their supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A country that can&rsquo;t protect its own borders cannot remain a sovereign nation,&rdquo; former Sen. Fred Thompson told supporters Thursday at a rally in suburban Des Moines. &ldquo;We have to stop illegal immigration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle cry was greeted with thunderous applause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Numbers help explain why immigration has become such a provocative issue in Iowa. A state that historically was nearly all white now has a Hispanic population of more than 115,000, an increase of more than one-third during the first half of this decade. As many as half of those people came illegally, according to the state&rsquo;s Division of Latino Affairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The whole town is here&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shift is even more pronounced in a handful of small cities such as Marshalltown, where industrial jobs, particularly in meatpacking plants, have been a powerful magnet for immigrants. During the 1990s, the city&rsquo;s Hispanic population increased more than tenfold. Hispanics today make up more than 12 percent of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I moved here, there were maybe three other Hispanic families,&rdquo; said Francesca Fernandez, who moved there 24 years ago. &ldquo;Then a neighbor moved, or a friend, or a relative&hellip; .   Suddenly, it was like the whole town is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life is mostly harmonious &mdash; &ldquo;the white and Hispanic people, they live together, no harassment,&rdquo; Fernandez said. But the community was deeply shaken by a raid last December at the Swift packing plant, one of several in states, including Minnesota, where officials arrested hundreds of illegal workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, a lot of people have left for other states,&rdquo; Fernandez said. &ldquo;Now, sometimes, I feel like I&rsquo;m half-Hispanic, half-American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since the raid, a lot of Hispanics here are very afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To be honest, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with them. Sure, there&rsquo;s riff-raff, but that&rsquo;s just people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidates like [Mitt] Romney want to ship all of them out, but that&rsquo;d be a phenomenal shock to our economy. To run a business anymore, you pretty much have to be bilingual. You adapt or fall off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting the message</p>
<p>With political passions running so high, it is perhaps little wonder that Marshalltown, a city of 26,000 smack in the center of Iowa, has had no fewer than 24 visits by presidential candidates this year.</p>
<p>In general, the Republicans, including Mike Huckabee and Rudy Giuliani, have taken a hard line on illegal immigration, opposing amnesty, guest worker programs and favoring the de facto sealing of America&rsquo;s southern border.</p>
<p>The Democrats, for whom immigration has been a far less important issue, have taken a considerably more conciliatory stance as they&rsquo;ve stumped across Iowa. The Democrats&rsquo; most visible efforts in Marshalltown are Spanish-language campaign brochures found in Hispanic businesses.</p>
<p>A University of Iowa Hawkeye Poll conducted in October found that among Iowans likely to attend the Jan. 3 precinct caucuses, 66 percent of Republicans rated illegal immigration as the top issue, as compared with 35 percent of Democrats.</p>
<p>So Arizona Sen. John McCain found himself viewed as something of a heretic in West Des Moines on Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Back in Marshalltown, the day before, as he shoveled snow off the steps of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Castillo was fuming. &ldquo;I wish people would stop discriminating against people who are just trying to help their families at home in other countries,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to work hard. We have rights, too, right?&rdquo;<br>

<p>That, combined with the high fluidity of candidate choice, is why I can&rsquo;t believe that open-borders fanatic Mike Huckabee will win in Iowa.</p>

			<p>Keep in mind that that is 66% of people willing to admit the anger that probably 95% actually feel. The other 5% are immigrants or those who whistfully hope that the world will some day match the false image of it provided by social engineers. Culturally, Iowa is still one of Americas Whitest states. If only they could overcome their Scandanavian taciturnity they could fully and without shame take complete possession of what is rightfully all theirs (their fundamental identity)</p>
<p>I am very curious about how this fact will be portrayed on tonights news.</p>

<p>I grew up in Riverside County in California and I can tell you that  we probably have more illegals than any other County in America except for Los Angeles.4 With only 115,ooo Hispanics the Iowans are taking the right approach. </p>

<p>Shennanigans. I&rsquo;ve been an Iowan for 48 years. 2o years ago meat packing plants paid $15-20 an hour. Now, with cheap illegals, it&rsquo;s more like $7-$8 an hour. </p>
<p>Make it a felony to hire illegals and the illegal immigration problem will nearly disappear.<br>

<p>The tide is turning, and I am more optimistic these days as to the future of bilingualism, and who is going to have to adapt, and who is going to fall off. 80 percent of Americans demanding enforcement only is not a tide I would care to swim against. Iowa, we will all be counting on you to help define the future of this country. Is America a soulless economic entity we allow to be strip-mined for the profits, or does our home still retain the heart and soul of 1776? I, for one, would not look forward to meeting George Washington, or a few million American soldiers in the afterlife and explaining what a &#8216;good deal&rsquo; we all got when we exchanged their devotion, their lives and their sacrifices, everything, for cheap labor and a big TV.</p>

			<p>sovereign citizens have sovereign rights, legal immigrants have civil rights, illegal immigrants have no rights under our constitutional form of government. illegal immigrants should go back to their home countries before they find themselves unable to cash their checks or wire money home. technicly, every county sheriff, as the highest ranking elected official in a county, could deport illegal aliens to his county line, into another county. his neighboring sheriff could let them stay in his jurisdiction, or deport them to the next county. the only thing stopping them is fear and the aclu. illegal workers could not stay without cooperation from banks,landlords, grocery stores,etc&hellip;</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s a total lie.  Rudy is pathetic on immigration, just like he is pathetic on almost every conservative issue.  Huckabee is a lying snake who is on record as being strongly pro-illegal immigrant.  They can both forget it.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The Democrats, for whom immigration has been a far less important issue, have taken a considerably more conciliatory stance as they&rsquo;ve stumped across Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
This is also a lie.  Every single democratic candidate is rabidly pro-illegal immigrant.  </p>
<p>If you were to grade their positions, most republicans would get C&rsquo;s, Giuliani would get a D and all of the dems would get F minuses (and have gotten together to mug the teacher afterward).</p>
<p>Duncan Hunter would get an A+ but nobody wants to vote for him.  Ron Paul would get maybe a C+ and Fred Thompson would get a B.  Tancredo would have gotten an A but he dropped out of school.</p>

			<p>People don&rsquo;t realize that this is, along with SoCAL agriculture, where illegal immigration started. It began with the breaking of the meat packers union in the late &rsquo;70s. Major packing plants started smaller plants in towns across Iowa and Nebraska. This allowed them to gradually shut down the large central plants. They them bussed the Mexicans in and broke the unions back in complete media quiet. <br>
Several people have pointed out that wages in both agriculture and construction have fallen from $15-20 to the $7-8 today. What they don&rsquo;t point out is the impact of inflation in the 40 year period. That $15-20 would be $70-80 today. And that is a real cost of immigration.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigration (mostly from Mexico) is NOT the most important issue: LEGAL immigration (more and more from Africa and radical Islamic areas) is the REAL problem! Something many of these stupid people find out after the Mexican illegals are run out of the local meat-packing plant by ICE raids and are then replaced by LEGAL black Muslim Somalis, Nigerians, Congolese, Jamaicans or Haitians instead. </p>

<p>&#8220;Back in Marshalltown, the day before, as he shoveled snow off the steps of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Castillo was fuming. &ldquo;I wish people would stop discriminating against people who are just trying to help their families at home in other countries,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to work hard. We have rights, too, right?&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Sure, you have rights   &mdash;   in Mexico. If you are an illegal in America you should have all the rights of a bankrobber, a check-forger, or a rapist&hellip; which is to say, NONE. </p>
<p>Am-scray, Jose. Beat it. Get lost. Go home. You&rsquo;re not wanted in Iowa, or any other US state. Your &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; is frightfully expensive   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s costing us our country. </p>
<p>Also, does anybody want to wager that &#8220;Two decades after he left his native Mexico,&#8221; Senor Castillo made his traitorous and ungrateful comments IN SPANISH which the leftist media helpfully translated (yet neglected to mention)? </p>

I was watching c-span this morning, Washington Journal. The guest was the man representing Rudy Giulianis&rsquo; and his position on immigration. (Giuliani has his own person exclusively working on this issue).</p>
<p>The guy was completely out of touch (as are most mainstream politicians) with the callers who were demanding accountability. This guy just kept repeating the tired old dogma that &#8216;yes, the system is broken but cracking down on illegals is impractical and unworkable so we&rsquo;re just going to have to find a way of making the best of the problem/opportunity and help the good illegal aliens find their place in America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The c-span audience would have none of it but this guy didn&rsquo;t pick up on the extent of the anger. He just kept plugging away in his upbeat presentation.</p>
<p>Before considering Giuliani for President, you would be wise to research his position on immigration. Chances are, if you&rsquo;re an AR reader, you won&rsquo;t like his position one iota.<br>

			<p>First, the only Presidential Candidate that is even mentioning &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; - automatic citizenship, which by the way is a gross misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, is Dr. Ron Paul. But of course this article does not seem to address that. </p>
<p>Dr. Ron Paul is right, America does not need a fence, sensors on the border will work just fine, as long as all the benefits are cut off, i.e., food stamps, free education and medical care, automatic citizenship for the illegal babies, etc&hellip; And furthermore, make it a Felony with enormous fines and jail time for any business or person that harbors illegal aliens. Most illegal aliens would self deport in a matter of 12 months or less when they can not earn any money to wire home and receive free benefits from the honest tax payers.  </p>
<p>The only illegal aliens that would be in need of rounding up is the illegal criminal gangs, i.e., MS-13 and the police department seems to know where they operate, so in other words it would not be to hard to find them and exile them permanently out of the country. </p>
<p>Secondly, LEGAL IMMIGRATION is the biggest threat to this nations survival. 2 million immigrants come to this country legally from third world countries that hate us for everything we stand. 90% of the legal immigrants are non-white people thanks to Traitor Ted Kennedy changing the removing the quotas on immigration in 1965. This is NOT BY ACCIDENT EITHER! Concur and divide. In order for one nation to survive &ldquo;multi-ethnic&rdquo; and diverse populations that live under one roof together without killing each other is to have a DICTATOR in place. </p>
<p>A perfect example, Iraq before the invasion of the USA. Saddem was a brutal dictator, nobody denies that, however take a closer look, the population of Iraq, Sunni, Shiites and Kurds, a very diverse population, they lived together just fine because Saddem was a brutal dictator. And now that he is GONE, they are all trying to kill each other in a civil war – aka: RACE WAR, and are soldiers are over there getting plucked off trying to settle this race war. It is NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Iraq has to have another brutal dictator put back into power.  </p>
<p>WAKE UP WHITE CHRISTIAN AMERICA.  </p>
<p>VOTE FOR RON PAUL! </p>

			<p>The talk must stop. We must secure our borders now. A nation without secure borders is no nation at all. It makes no sense to fight terrorists abroad when our own front door is left unlocked. This is my six point plan:</p>
<p>    * Physically secure our borders and coastlines. We must do whatever it takes to control entry into our country before we undertake complicated immigration reform proposals.<br>
    * Enforce visa rules.  Immigration officials must track visa holders and deport anyone who overstays their visa or otherwise violates U.S. law.  This is especially important when we recall that a number of 9/11 terrorists had expired visas.<br>
    * No amnesty.  Estimates suggest that 10 to 20 million people are in our country illegally. That&rsquo;s a lot of people to reward for breaking our laws.<br>
    * No welfare for illegal aliens.  Americans have welcomed immigrants who seek opportunity, work hard, and play by the rules.  But taxpayers should not pay for illegal immigrants who use hospitals, clinics, schools, roads, and social services.<br>
    * End birthright citizenship.  As long as illegal immigrants know their children born here will be citizens, the incentive to enter the U.S. illegally will remain strong. <br>
    * Pass true immigration reform.  The current system is incoherent and unfair.  But current reform proposals would allow up to 60 million more immigrants into our country, according to the Heritage Foundation.  This is insanity.  Legal immigrants from all countries should face the same rules and waiting periods.</p>

<p>YES, you are bad people.  You broke into our country, you steal some American&rsquo;s social security number to work illegally, you squat down and have several anchor babies and then collect food stamps, welfare, housing subsidies, free K-12 education, free health care, etc.  And&hellip;. you have no intention of ever paying for these services, and thus, by definition, that is called theft (which makes you a bad person).<br>

<p>Maybe, maybe not.  But most of them are guilty of at least one crime: entering this country and working here illegally.  And for that, we can blame them.</p>
<p>*Life is mostly harmonious &mdash; &ldquo;the white and Hispanic people, they live together, no harassment,&rdquo; Fernandez said*</p>
<p>Ms. Fernandez is thinking, of course, of White on hispanic harassment.  Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think the reverse situation - hispanic harassment of Whites - is that trivial.</p>
<p>*&#8221;Sure, there&rsquo;s riff-raff, but that&rsquo;s just people.&#8221;*</p>
<p>But some groups of people have a lot more riff-raff than others, and hispanics tend to be near the top of that list.</p>
<p>*&ldquo;I wish people would stop discriminating against people who are just trying to help their families at home in other countries,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to work hard. We have rights, too, right?&rdquo;*</p>
<p>It appears Mr. Castillo doesn&rsquo;t understand that these people are called &#8220;illegals&#8221; for a reason: they broke the law, and they don&rsquo;t belong or deserve to be here.  They don&rsquo;t deserve most legal rights when they don&rsquo;t respect the legal system that secures such rights.</p>

			<p>My real job is in the health care business. I &#8220;examine&#8221; people, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>My staff (all white) and I can&rsquo;t stand it when our new &#8220;Americans&#8221; call for an appointment and WE CAN&#8221;T UNDERSTAND A THING THEY SAY yet they get mad at us.</p>
<p>Well, rather than get mad, we play a wonderful and fun game. We simple say, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, can you repeat that again?&#8221;, Over and over. Always polite, always polite.</p>
<p>They get so MAD. We stay calm. &#8220;Can you please repeat that again?&#8221; They hang up. We smile and move one.</p>
<p>Always put the problem on THEM. Never, ever be impolite. Just upset them by letting them have their way. These are some really STuPID people who call  you, they can&rsquo;t even speak your language, but expect to make an appointment. What an idiotic culture this must be.</p>
<p>Fighting back is so much fun. We love it now when one of these new &#8220;Americans&#8221; call us. We love it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As late as 1921, Vice-President-elect Calvin Coolidge wrote an article on immigration called &#8216;Whose Country Is This?&rsquo; in the popular women&rsquo;s magazine Good Housekeeping. He argued that&hellip;&rsquo;Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend.&rsquo;&#8221; (Race and the American Identity (Part II), AR Classic Article, posted December 19, 2007).</p>
<p>The fact that not even the most anti-immigration politician of today feels able to speak in the terms used by Coolidge shows how far we have to go.</p>
<p>But mental attitudes change a step at a time.</p>

			<p>You know that old joke about not being able to tell any non-White apart? It goes something like this.</p>
<p>There was an Arab man who married a Hispanic woman- in the USA, where both had come as &#8216;immigrants.&rsquo; They had boys- twins, as a matter of fact, which they named Amahl and Juan, to be &#8216;properly multicultural,&rsquo; and to &#8216;respect&rsquo; their differing cultural heritages.</p>
<p>No one could tell them apart, not even the father. Whenever the boys would get into trouble (which was often) the father had to go to the mother to determine the offending child&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Finally, after years of this, the mother had had it; wth the father, with the relatives, with the neighbors, with the Public School officials. Whenever one boy did something wrong, her stock response from then on, was:</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does it make? Once you&rsquo;ve seen Juan, you&rsquo;ve seen Amahl.&#8221;</p>
<p>That about sums it up for me. America for Americans! Non-whites, &#8220;raus!&#8221;</p>

<p>Read How the Irish Saved Civilization, by Thomas Cahill. What do you think would have happend to Hellenistic culture had Africans been charged with this task. Asian&rsquo;s could have managed but would they have created the paintings, cathedrals and presses that propelled mankind through the renaissance up to the industrial revolution. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Secondly, LEGAL IMMIGRATION is the biggest threat to this nations survival. 2 million immigrants come to this country legally from third world countries that hate us for everything we stand. 90% of the legal immigrants are non-white people thanks to Traitor Ted Kennedy changing the removing the quotas on immigration in 1965.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Which is exactly why I am AGAINST Ron Paul.  He is weak on LEGAL immigration.  Plus his stance on the border fence is unacceptably naive.  I agree with him that cutting off the benefits for illegals will drive many of them away but the fence is not needed to keep out job and welfare thieves.  The fence is needed to stop the main source of income for immigrants&hellip;.DRUGS.  Drug sales (subsidized by blacks using their welfare money) are the main source of income and power (that means guns and money to run gangs) for illegals.  The drug trade is basically 99% run over our souther border by illegal aliens.  We can cut that off at the knees if we build a fence and are serious about defending it with soldiers.  This would cost a tiny fraction of what it costs to deal with those drugs once they are over the border, destroying our communities and making blacks even more violent than they are just genetically.</p>
<p>To be blunt, Paul pisses me off.  He is the ONLY candidate that endorses certain issues that need to eventually be addressed in this country.  But, on the most important issues, he is simply not good enough.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe your people are NOT terrorists. Maybe not every Mexican is a murderer or rapist&hellip; But far TOO MANY MEXICANS are thieves, burglars, petty criminals. Not to mention drug dealers, drug smugglers, or prone to driving while intoxicated. </p>
<p>MOST MEXICANS are here illegally, as well as here AGAINST THE WILL OF AMERICAN PEOPLE&hellip; who are sick and tired of how Mexicans live, think and act! In other words, Jose Castillo. YOU DON&rsquo;T BELONG IN IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME IN OUR COUNTRY, SO PLEASE PACK UP AND LEAVE!</p>

			<p>Ron Paul is weak on the issue of legal immigration.  I saw him on a pod cast endorsing legal immigration, in a rather generous way.  We need a complete end to all immigration, including legal immigration.  I still support him because he is for so many other things that are correct and necessary.  If he were successful in returning our government to its proper form, a constitutional republic, however, it would not be long before such a government, expressing the will of its people put a stop to immigration.  Thus, I would not take this position of Ron Paul&rsquo;s too seriously  &mdash;  anyone who is for the elimination of the IRS, the Dept of Education, etc need not be perfect, just a million miles ahead of all the rest.  To support anyone but Ron Paul is to simply buy into the same old status quo  &mdash;  platitudes on immigration notwithstanding  &mdash;  and I cannot imagine a worse thing to do.  I support Ron Paul because he believes in the constitution.  There is no place in the constitution where massive legal immigration is endorsed.<br>
The alternatives are so horrible that one would be mad to pick any of them.  Vote Ron Paul  &mdash;  he is our last, best chance at saving our nation, period.</p>

<p>When you sneak into our country illegally? Try looking at it from OUR PERSPECTIVE! The huge amount of crime, by Hispanics. Their insatiable demand for taxpayer-funded hand-outs, including healthcare, welfare subsidies, FREE education for them, their families. Their animalistic lifestyle and mentality   &mdash;   the &#8220;if it was OK in Mexico, why should the Americans be bothered by it&#8221; mentality. Expressed by public urination, trashing of the areas where they live. Drunken driving accidents. Rapes and even killings, by illegal Hispanic immigrants. Ok, the rapes, killings might be small in comparison to the number of thefts and burglaries, but they DO HAPPEN, far too often for us to have to put up with immigration. This is OUR America, and your people have long ago worn out your welcome!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for always being the pessimist, but, despite this very positive news that many people seem to be awakening to this problem, I also see a sinister side to this that I think should be pointed out.    </p>
<p>This is all well and good   &mdash;   that many Americans are &#8220;waking up&#8221; to the illegal immigration crisis   &mdash;   but when will we start hearing these same people become more vocal about *legal* immigration as well?  The real crisis has to do with immigration, period   &mdash;   illegal as well as legal.  </p>
<p>The immigration debate seems always to be framed in terms of it being a problem of legality versus illegality; in other words, if only those millions of blessed Mexicans and others pouring across the border would go through the proper legal processes, then we&rsquo;d welcome them with open arms, because then they would have &#8220;shown respect for America&#8221; by &#8220;obeying the law&#8221;.  This is all the (mainstream) Republicans have to offer on this issue   &mdash;   an argument for the importance of law and order.  Never mind who comes, how many come, and from where.  Whether these people come legally or illegally is not the issue.  And making that the issue, as the mainstream politicians do, is akin to placing all the emphasis on *how* a particular crime is committed rather than what its effects are.  &#8220;As long as the bank robbers come through the front door,&#8221; these politicians might say, &#8220;then it&rsquo;s okay with me if they succeed in robbing the bank.&#8221;          </p>
<p>To my mind, the danger here is that people will be lulled into the feeling that the problem has been solved if and when the borders are secured and illegal immigration is all but stopped.  But that&rsquo;s only half the battle.  </p>

			<p>Tim Kennerly, what was your point?</p>
<p>You mention EUROPEANS as the bearers of civilization, against a joke I merely pass on, about those NOT of that race or culture?</p>
<p>I do not see the point you were trying to make.</p>
<p>If Westeren Civilization has ANY merit, (and I believe it does) it has that merit on a number of fronts:</p>
<p>Christianity - of the fathers, the councils, and the Greek NT.<br>
White racial awareness- the noble Vikings, Germans, Celts that make up large tracts of modern Europe, as well as Canada, teh USA, and Oz.<br>
Intellect- If &#8216;IQ and the wealth of Nations&rsquo; is any clue, the greatest inventions, standard of living, and hope for the future lies with monogamous Whites, not miscegenated mestizos, which is what the joke I merely forwarded on, was meant to allude to!</p>
<p>You merely corroborate my point, rather than refute it.</p>

<p>The ONLY thing missing in Tim&rsquo;s otherwise flawless post is the demand to STRIP THE DAMNED ANCHOR BABIES OF THEIR UNDESERVED CITIZENSHIP.</p>
<p>Hey, if the father robs a bank, gives the money to his adult children, then the father is jailed, you can bet the children will NOT be allowed to keep the loot their daddy stole. So why should anchor babies be allowed to profit from the crime (of ilelgal entry) by their parents. Without even factoring in the reality WE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS got stuck for the costs of birthing and caring for the damned anchor babies, regardless of present age.</p>
<p>It may not do much good. but PLEASE start flooding Congress, as well as State government officials, and surely the newspapers (Letters to the Editor) with our protests, our outrage over immigration, undeserved citizenship and the staggering cost of illegal (as well as LEGAL) immigration laid on the average American citizen. The crime. The social problems. The third-world mentality of immigrants. Mention also that far too many Anmericans (including BLACK Americans) are losing jobs to cheap-working immigrants.</p>
<p>Whether it does much practical good or not is not the issue. MAKE THE BASTARDS LISTEN! At all levels. In all places. We, The American People have a voice, and need to make ourselves heard!</p>
<p>Budget a few bucks for a roll of stamps. Mailed letters have more impact than e-mails, sorry to say. So DO BOTH! This is an Election Year   &mdash;   for Senators, Congressmen, and the Presidency. MAKE THE RATS IN CONGRESS WAKE UP AND LISTEN.</p>
<p>If you learn anything of importance, SHARE it on this website. Also share e-mail and mailing addresses, when they can be put to good use by our readers. We need a grass-roots effort to STOP Hillary Clinton, Barrak Obama, and all those other traitors who believe in listening to the corporate doublespeak rather than the will of the American citizens and voters.</p>

			<p>Fed Up:  Why do so many people claim the president is the one responsible for all of America&rsquo;s problems?  It is the congress who has the final say in authorizing the treachery we face.  Orwell&rsquo;s 1984 explained exactly why countries elect or appoint presidents, kings, czars, emperors, etc as figureheads.  It is because countries are ruled by self-serving organizations and public awareness of this fact makes the individual common man feel politically impotent.  So governments create a single figurehead upon which the individual common man can focus his adoration or hatred on a one on one basis and thusly feel politically empowered.  Today our politicians appear before the public as nothing more than empty two dimensional images put forth by the news media while they spend their terms in office cowering behind armor plating and bodyguards&hellip;  </p>

Its been that way for at least the last 200 years. Notice that they are most active in pushing their genocidal agenda ONLY in white nations. Asians know all about them; thats why they will NOT tolerate these highly intelligent aliens to immigrate and wreck havoc against their nations.</p>
