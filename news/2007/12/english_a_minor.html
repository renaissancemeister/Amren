						<i>James Kirkup, London Telegraph, December 17, 2007</i></font> 
					</div>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The Daily Telegraph has obtained data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families illustrating the impact of high levels of immigration on the education system.</p>
<p>The figures show that in a total of 1,338 primary and secondary schools &mdash; more than one in 20 of all schools in England &mdash; children with English as their first language are in the minority.</p>
<p>In 600 of these schools, fewer than a third of pupils speak English as their first language.</p>
<p>The disclosure led to warnings that the rising number of foreign pupils without a decent grasp of English was putting intense pressure on teachers and undermining education standards.</p>
<p>The figures have fuelled demands from teachers&rsquo; leaders for more money to help meet the costs of teaching foreign-born children.</p>
<p>Teachers&rsquo; unions said educating a single non-English-speaking pupil could cost as much as £30,000 a year.</p>
<p>Coping with large numbers of foreign children risked undermining the quality of teaching given to all pupils, they said.</p>
<p>Philip Parkin, the general secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers, said rising levels of immigration and a lack of multi-lingual teaching staff were &#8220;providing serious challenges&#8221; for schools trying to maintain standards.</p>
<p>Dealing with non-English-speaking children &#8220;makes it much harder to deliver the curriculum&#8221;, Mr Parkin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools that are in that position need considerable support in order to give those children help with English and help with our curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government needs to be looking at funding the employment of teachers or teaching assistants, in addition to the staff they have, who are bilingual or multilingual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the National Association of Head Teachers said some schools were struggling to cope with the influx of foreign pupils.</p>
<p>Mick Brookes, the union&rsquo;s general secretary, told a Lords committee that the situation was &#8220;out of control&#8221;.</p>
<p>A rush of migrants into an area can &#8220;strain or even break the resources of the school&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>Last night, Mr Brookes said the latest figures proved the case for putting additional resources into the areas dealing with large numbers of non-English speakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are children who cannot speak the language,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Others are refugees who may have witnessed some horrible things.</p>
<p>&#8220;These children may not just need support to speak English, but often they require counselling to talk them through the trauma they have witnessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families show that in 574 of the 17,361 primary schools in England, children without English as a first language make up between 51 and 70 per cent of all pupils.</p>
<p>Another 569 primaries have more than 70 per cent who count English as a second language.</p>
<p>In 112 of the 3,343 secondary schools, children without English as a first language make up 51 to 70 per cent of all pupils. In another 83 secondary schools, the proportion is above 70 per cent.</p>
<p>The total number of schools where pupils with a first language other than English make up at least 51 per cent of the population is 1,338.</p>
<p>Following patterns of immigration, children who do not speak English as a first language are heavily concentrated in certain areas of the country, especially London.</p>
<p>The 20 councils with the highest concentration of non-English speaking children are in London.</p>
<p>In the borough of Newham, nine out of 10 schools have a non-English first language majority. The same is true of a third of schools in Leicester and in Blackburn, and a quarter of schools in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown last week repeated calls for immigrants to learn English, but critics say he is not doing enough to fund proper language teaching for immigrant children.</p>
<p>David Davis, the Conservative shadow home secretary, accused the Government of failing to meet the costs of its immigration policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been warning the Government for years now of the consequences for schools of the very high rate of immigration,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This shows how many schools will face real difficulties.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Government said last night that it was properly funding schools facing extra costs from children struggling with English.</p>
<p>A DCSF spokesman said: &#8220;We have listened to the unions&rsquo; concerns and are increasing funding in the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant to £206 million by 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also introduced new guidance for teachers to work with new arrivals. There&rsquo;s actually surplus money in the school system to deal with any &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even Labour MPs have expressed concern that the Government is failing to keep up with immigration.</p>
<p>Phyllis Starkey, the Labour chairman of the communities and local government committee of MPs, last week warned Mr Brown that funding delays risked inflaming &#8220;community conflict&#8221;.</p>
<p>Many of the pupils without English as their first language are the children of the 600,000 eastern Europeans who have come to Britain since the European Union&rsquo;s eastward expansion in 2004.</p>
<p>Official statistics last week showed that one in five births in Britain last year was to a woman from overseas.</p>
