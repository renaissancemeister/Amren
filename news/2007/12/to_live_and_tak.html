						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No, I am referring to the government of the city, the municipality, the hamlet nestled on the historic Potomac. Incredibly, one woman alone is said to have masterminded a scheme in which she and others allegedly stole at least $20 million from the city &mdash; and the city never noticed.</p>
<p>Move over, Illinois. Eat your heart out, Maryland. Doff your cap, New York. Have some respect, New Jersey, or, for that matter, Louisiana, a state long admired for its political corruption. That sort of stuff is old-fashioned. In all those places, it&rsquo;s the politicians who steal from the people. In Washington, it&rsquo;s the people who steal from the people.</p>
<p>Take the scheme that withdrew millions upon millions of dollars from the city&rsquo;s coffers. Not a politician involved. Instead, those accused are all bureaucrats and their alleged accessories &mdash; prominently, a mid-level manager in the Office of Tax and Revenue. All they did was allegedly issue tax refunds to dummy corporations and then cash the checks themselves. They are accused of having done this for years. A Post analysis said the total could be up to $44 million.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, an executive responsible for 17 charter schools took or illegally steered more than $800,000. Others in the school system dipped into student recreation funds, not quite taking candy from babies, just field trips and the like. Again, notice the absence of elected officials or corrupt politicians. Why, one school official took $30,000 from the chess club of a school for emotionally disturbed pupils &mdash; a dark chapter not even Dickens could envisage.</p>
<p>The Santa Clausiness of the D.C. government is almost beyond comprehension. It seems that all you have to do is work there and money just falls into your lap. For instance, The Post reported just last week on how a former principal requested a grant to train teachers and the school system authorized $3 million in a single day. And when she went to pick up the first $1 million, the school system just handed over the money &mdash; no silly, fussy contract or anything like that.</p>
<p>The things that happen in Washington for some reason stay in Washington. They get almost no national attention, even though the town practices corruption on a scale that compares to kleptocracies like Nigeria or kingdoms like Saudi Arabia. In Italy, something like 20 percent of the economy is underground. In Washington, the figure is precisely 78 percent. I made that up, but it feels right.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now Washington has left Maryland in the dust. It is not just the Enronian $20 million, possibly a modern-day record for municipal corruption. It&rsquo;s the democratization of corruption and the sheer heartlessness of it. Am I naive? Would any of the Maryland crooks I covered (and liked) have stolen money from emotionally disturbed children? I don&rsquo;t think so. These people were soft, unimaginative &mdash; conservative gents who embraced tradition, shunned innovation, and by and large thought a gridlock of Jaguars in the driveway was in awfully bad taste.</p>

<p>Speaking of Enron, not long after the Enron scandal, some black administrative head of Sallie Mae (or maybe it was Fannie Mae) was accused of Enron-style book cooking that amounted in the billions, and it was multiple times the amount of &#8220;bad&#8221; money in the Enron scandal.  Yet very little was said about it in <span class="caps">MSM. </span> Someone help me out here for the rest of the details.</p>

					<p>What do you expect when you keep re-electing the same people time after time ? Are term limits the answer ? How about outlawing lobbying ? How about the Government Accounting Office doing an audit on every elected federal official annually ? Will a line item veto do the trick ? Is the federal government so big and complicated that no one knows just what the hell is going on all the time ? You tell me.</p>

					<p>Now you see the Benefits of Diversity!  In the dark of night, the scavengers hunt in packs on the color-blind liberal herbivores.  In the halls of justice, egalitarians deny the racism of the brown mob that commits the crimes against the American people and see to adding darkness to juries for the purpose of dimming the hopes seen by victims and their families.<br>
Where does the money go?  Billions for defense, but the Americans are chased from their lands by invaders!?  Billions for education, but American children go to dilapidated schools and use worn filthy textbooks!?  Billions for healthcare, but the American people wait in long lines after the rest of the world - who have better healthcare because they use our hospitals for free!?<br><br>
Waste?  Fraud?  Abuse?  <span class="caps">NO, JUST PLAIN OLD EMBEZZLEMENT</span>!  The outreach to the poor abused unrepresented criminals has made them all safe from the nasty <span class="caps">LAWS </span>of America!  You need not pay taxes to receive the benefits - in fact only those that do not pay get to receive from The Great Society!<br><br>
The New Deal is this - <span class="caps">ALL TAXATION,</span> NO <span class="caps">REPRESENTATION</span>!  Diversity includes everyone in America except the Americans.  NO <span class="caps">ONE </span>who is White or Male or Christian or Law-Abiding or Productive or Intelligent or Sane <span class="caps">NEED APPLY </span>for a position in the Poppy Flower Power Nanny State!<br><br>
<span class="caps">USA </span>no - <span class="caps">USSR </span>si!  Viva the Towel Wearing!  What could possibly go wrong?  Just so long as nothing ever goes right!  Right no - rights oui! The French had the idea - kill Robespierre and his Reign of Terror will end!<br><br>
PC is good, as long as it means Personal Computer.  10 Commandments and 10 Amendments - no more and no less&hellip;<br><br>
Understand that the future is Now, and I do not mean that man-hater lobby!  Listen well and know what I see is True.  Victory means Defeat for those that say the opposite of what they mean!  Dollars are not backed by Silver or Gold - just the work it causes makes the value of the market.  The Conspiracy Theory is the Real Conspiracy - power comes from the people that do the tasks that need doing.  The Sum of the productive is greater than the parts, but the Product of the dependent always remains the same - such that 1000 &#215; 0 = 0 .</p>

					<p>And so it&rsquo;s racist to be against statehood for this gaggle of antisocial, corrupt, welfare millionares who enrich themselves  at the trough of taxpayer stupidity?  Let&rsquo;s move the capital to, say, Salt Lake City or Lawrence, Kansas, where we&rsquo;ll get a bigger bang for our buck, not banged by brothers for all the bucks. The capital has become a pathological community right before our eyes, but nobody has the orbs to clean it up&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyone with half a brain knows that the most egregious kleptocrats in Wasington DC are the 535 members of congress, the president, vice president and cabinet.  This juvenille stuff listed above pales in comparison.</p>

					<p>Just goes to show how we need to completely revise our tax system.  Instead of everyone paying most taxes federally, then distributed to the states (spreading the graft around), taxes need to primarily be a local phenomenon.  The blacks in DC can then steal from themselves, primarily.</p>
<p>One step in the right direction is the FairTax plan (endorsed by several of the major republican candidates including Ron Paul)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fairtax.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.fairtax.org</a></p>
<p>Basically, replaces our current tax system with a dramatically simpler and more fair, &#8220;national&#8221; sales tax.  It&rsquo;s only a short step from this to a &#8220;state&#8221; sales tax being the primary form of tax, if you catch my drift.  Which is, of course, the real goal of this reform. No one is going to admit it though until years after it&rsquo;s been implemented and people start questioning why taxes collected in my neighborhood have to supplement their neighborhood.  The US isn&rsquo;t there yet, but the way people think is evolving in that direction.  And the stuff going on in DC is a big part of the reason why.  Only racially conscious people are annoyed at their taxes being wasted on people who hate them.  <span class="caps">STOLEN </span>though.  That&rsquo;s another matter.</p>

					<p>A long time ago someone stated that Blacks consider government to be an employment agency; well, Blacks also consider government to be a piggybank with an infinite amount of funds tha can be siphoned off&hellip; as long as they don&rsquo;t get caught. And even if they do, Blacks will vote them back into office!</p>

					<p>This just proves again that the demographic group that controls the <br>
government of <span class="caps">D.C. </span>has no business spending the taxes whites are forced to pay. What percentage of the stolen money came from the &#8220;community&#8221;: 5%? If they want to steal from each other, that&rsquo;s their business. This is essentially stealing from the &#8220;white man&#8221;.I&rsquo;m sure the callousness these parasites exhibited was justified by &#8220;We are just taking money that&rsquo;s owed to us by the white man&#8221;.</p>

					<p>No words are adequate, its&hellip;I can&rsquo;t&hellip;the&hellip;my&hellip; They&rsquo;re turning me into a babbling idiot.  </p>
<p>One thing is clear to me, however.  I can see it on the distant horizon (it&rsquo;s my genetic long-sightedness, don&rsquo;t you know).  I see a great edifice, biblical in size.  I hear wailing and gnashing of teeth. I see bars over the windows&hellip;and what&rsquo;s this?  soft white hands gripping those bars.  But who are they?  Could they be&hellip;?  Yes, they&rsquo;re all journalists - cell after cell stretching to the horizon.  I ask a wise looking old man - no, I implore him to tell me what the crime of these poor people could be.  Perpetuating crime, he tells me. Encouraging fellonies by concealing evidence.  Can you not smell the stench of hypocricy?  And I concede that I am indeed labouring under the affliction of an odouriferous putrefaction.  And as a wander off an old rememberance is awakened.  It is from the book of Revelation, and the words refer to the time when lies are believed and the truth is disbelieved.  I go home and make some falafal.</p>

					<p>The problem in DC started when home rule was established, the most famous mayor of DC - Marion Barry - used the government jobs and money as political &#8216;grease&rsquo;.  He didn&rsquo;t want accountability, so his administration resisted computerizing the financial section of the DC government.  No one could tell where the money went.  The black residents of DC looked upon this as an opportunity to get some of &#8216;what they were owed&rsquo;.  So, government jobs were handed out to political friends and their families - people with no skills or intention of serving the public or the city, only a desire to &#8216;work the system&rsquo; for their own gain. </p>
<p>The people involved in the latest scandal are from that era.</p>

					<p><i>Why, one school official took $30,000 from the chess club of a school for emotionally disturbed pupils &mdash; a dark chapter not even Dickens could envisage.</i></p>
<p>Forget the crook who took the money - how the hell did a school chess club get $30,000 to begin with? I went to a pretty large high school and I&rsquo;m pretty sure if you added up the funds for all the clubs combined it wouldn&rsquo;t have come to much more than that. I know that the two (sizeable) clubs chaired didn&rsquo;t have much money.</p>
<p>And we all wonder how <span class="caps">D.C. </span>manages to do so poorly when it spends so much on its pupils. Well, here&rsquo;s part of the reason.</p>

This is example of democracy in action.  the government will only be as good as those who elect it.  When a city is full of crime it elects criminals.  The defense attorneys are getting all the money for criminal trials and prisons are fast taking tax dollars.  Like <span class="caps">CA, </span>there will be more criminals than room to put them and the costs are rapidly escalating.

					<p>Remember, people in government really do not care about you.  The government, police, military and national guard cannot and will not protect you.  In fact, after Katrina, the National Guard went through New Orleans neighborhoods confiscating guns from homeowners who where sitting in front of, and protecting, their own homes.  </p>
<p>You and your family are on your own.  Know how to protect yourself and your family.  Know how to live and survive outside the established economy, because you may someday need to do that.  Can you get to a safe place?  Can you defend it?  Do you have kin and friends with whom you can ban?  It may not come in our lifetime, but I guarantee it will come.  Massive immigration of Third Worlders will overtake our cities, overwhelming social support systems and our ability to physically maintain the millions and millions of city dwelers.  As oil runs out and infrastructure crumbles, it will be impossible to get to work, heat or cool houses, get food or water into the centers of giant cities, or remove garbage and sewage.  We saw what happened after Katrina, and that was only a week of uncomfortable conditions.  Imagine wshat will happen after 1 month of no food or water or electricity.  Throughout history, all great civilizations have come to an end.  Ours will not be the first nor the last.  Be prepared.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s one black politician who&rsquo;s on the level. He&rsquo;s Cory Booker in Newark. However he hasn&rsquo;t got a prayer of turning Newark around. All the blacks already hate him and want to go back to the old Sharpe (he&rsquo;s under indictment) James ways of doing things. That&rsquo;s the way it is here in <span class="caps">N.J.</span> All the people, White and black want corrupt politicians in charge.</p>

					<p>Clearly if all states were black-run it wouldn&rsquo;t take long before the US resembled sub-Saharan Africa. I read that when Africans acquire a degree of power, no matter how little, they are expected to exploit people for the benefit of their nearest and dearest. Indeed it is shameful if they do not behave like this. It sounds cultural but, looking at blacks in power outside Africa, it becomes manifestly genetic.  Without a doubt I would trust my own children to do a better job.</p>

					<p>It is often erroneously stated that although blacks massively outstrip Whites in the <span class="caps">USA </span>in the commision of crimes of theft, violence and robbery, this fact is vitiated to some extent by an &#8216;over-reppresentation&rsquo; of Whites in crimes of fraud and embezzlement.This &#8216;argument&rsquo; is of course used to impugn the character of Whites and to try to make a &#8216;level playing field of dishonesty&rsquo;.<br>
In fact statistics prove that blacks are over-represented in fraud and deceptio vis-a-vis Whites.</p>

					<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable that this piece was written by Richard Cohen.  He&rsquo;s about as far left as they come, even for the editorial pages of the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Allow me to offer some advice, Commissar Cohen:  If you keep this up, you may find yourself dis-invited to the <span class="caps">D.C. </span>cocktail circuit.</p>

					<p>Next summer the Democratic Convention will again demand statehood for DC with 2 Senators and a voting Representative.  Yet, the city is utterly corrupt.  The liberal media generally fail to draw this to the attention of the nation, for they are too busy promoting the defense of the Jena 6.<br>
Jared Diamond, the academic anti-racist, wrote &#8220;Collapse.&#8221;  Well, what about the collapse of New Orleans levees?  What about the corruption of the city officials in a city run by Blacks since the early 1970s.  Only after New Orleans became a Chocolate City did it collapse.  If DC were not bailed out by the Fedral Government, it too would collapse.  Chocolate cities, like chocolate countries, seem to collapse.  Is there some gener rule we may conclude?  Jared Diamond would not dare say that - for he is too busy denouncing &#8220;racism.&#8221;<br><br>
At present DC does not deserve statehood.  It deserves to collapse.  And the reason is not the academic claptrap propounded by Diamond.  Is is the kleptocracy of the chocolates, and the liberal, vanilla media that refuses to expose chocolate corruption, chocolate rape, chocolate murder.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM   </p>

I have to disagree with you.  Maybe Archer never got caught stealing but he was involved in hampering police efforts to arrest criminals:</p>

<p>On behalf of <span class="caps">NLC,</span> I would like to express my gratitude to you, Mr. Chairman, for introducing S. 989, the &#8220;End Racial Profiling Act of 2001.&#8221; Your leadership on this issue, along with that of Representative John Conyers of Michigan, clearly shows your commitment to addressing this widespread practice of racial discrimination by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sounds great.  The problem is, it&rsquo;s a lie&hellip;.and every single person involved in government and the judiciary, and especially policing, knows it&rsquo;s a lie.  <span class="caps">WELL DOCUMENTED </span>as a lie.  Since Archer knows it&rsquo;s a lie, being responsible for one of the most crime infested hell holes on the planet, what is he engaged in here?  What he is doing is trying to intimidate police into not investigating or arresting blacks, engaged in crime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call that pretty corrupt.</p>

					<p>Re Kenelm Digby at 7:11 AM: I seem to recall that 70% of the acts of criminal fraud in the country are committed by Blacks, but the sums of money stolen add up to a much smaller percent.  That&rsquo;s because Whites with money won&rsquo;t entrust it to Blacks.  But of course, the Whites in Congress who underwrite DC aren&rsquo;t risking their own money.    </p>

					<p>Your Tax dollars at work in Little Nigeria</p>
<p>Harriette Walters&hellip;accused of stealing up to $44M &amp; shopping, shopping &amp; shopping&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
When the <span class="caps">FBI </span>raided the homes of  Harriette Walters and her posse, they found enough bling to put a blush on Paris Hilton&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>There were more than 100 handbags by Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Chanel. Then there was the Bentley, the furs, 100 pieces of  jewelry, 76 pairs of Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo and Ferragamo shoes, titles to several homes and vacation receipts.</p>
<p>Walters, alone,  charged more than $1.4 million at Neiman Marcus. </p>
<p>Walters, 51, was a mid-level manager for the Washington DC office of Tax and Revenue.  She, along with co-worker Diane Gustus and other &ldquo;best friends&rdquo;, forged checks and signatures on bogus tax returns due on non existent commercial properties. The average payment was about $388 thousand and get this&hellip;the activity went <span class="caps">UNDETECTED </span>by Tax and Revenue supervisors, all the way up to the Chief Financial Officer, for about a <span class="caps">HALF DECADE. </span></p>
<p>And not for a small amount of money.</p>
<p>$20 million in fraudulent refund checks have been traced to Harriette Walters and friends.</p>
<p>A Washington Post analysis has found $44.3 million in 160 suspicious property tax refund checks issued by the city.</p>
<p>So&hellip;who brought Walters and &ldquo;crew&rdquo; down?</p>
<p>A suspicious bank teller in Bowie, Maryland brought the scam to light. The alert employee refused to cash a six fugure refund check and called the government.</p>
<p>The rest is history.</p>

<p>Only because they are clumsy enough to be caught and exposed. White<br>
traitors of our nation, on the other hand, are far more sophisticated and surround themselves with a legal wall of immunity <span class="caps">BEFORE </span>they commit their crimes, and negotiate a memorandum of understanding ( spin, obfuscation, silence ) with the <span class="caps">MSM.</span> The Kennedys and Clintons come to mind. </p>

					<p>A chess club for emotionally disturbed pupils? Some $30,000 in the club treasury?</p>
<p>Something here <span class="caps">DOES NOT COMPUTE</span>!</p>
<p>First of all, emotionally disturbed pupils would hardly go for chess to begin with. It takes brains and concentration to play the game. As to that $30,000&hellip;  do they need gold and silver chess games? I mean why would the club need a $30,000 budget unless someone in the school system <span class="caps">INTENDED </span>to steal the money from the club treasury.</p>
<p>It really makes you wonder, doesn&rsquo;t it&hellip; If Blacks are so smart they can embezzle so many millions of dollars, why couldn&rsquo;t they be smart enough to have made money honestly. Like I&rsquo;ve pointed out before, Blacks and crime are about as inseparable as cold and ice.</p>
<p>This is too much like that Black lady defrauding the system to the tune of hundreds of thousands dollars in fraudulently obtained welfare checks.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the war cry to be raised is &#8220;you&rsquo;se only complaining cuz the thieves is Blacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>When i was in school we had a chess club, we even had an international chess champion come in and play the whole club simultaniously at speed chess he beat all but 2 of us.</p>
<p>Our annual budget was <span class="caps">ZERO.</span> We already had the boards and pieces, none of us were paid for playing, stewardship was provided on a volunteer basis by teachers, guest players were volunteers&hellip;. why would we need a budget? Crowd control for over enthusiastic spectators?????</p>

<p>Anyone with half a brain knows that the most egregious kleptocrats in Wasington DC are the 535 members of congress, the president, vice president and cabinet. This juvenille stuff listed above pales in comparison.</p>
<p>You mean 534 members of Congress are kleptocrats.  Don&rsquo;t forget that the 535th is Ron Paul, America&rsquo;s only honest politician.</p>
<p>Anyhow, while congressmen waste billions of tax dollars, for personal aggrandizement it&rsquo;s hard to beat the $20 million haul from the municipal government of Washington <span class="caps">D.C. </span> Congress has oversight over the city government but the day to day governance is done by local blacks, of the same ilk as those who kept reelecting Marion Barry.</p>
