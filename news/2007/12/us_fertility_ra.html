						<p>For the first time in 35 years, the U.S. fertility rate has climbed high enough to sustain a stable population, solidifying the nation&rsquo;s unique status among industrialized countries.</p>
<p>The overall fertility rate increased 2 percent between 2005 and 2006, nudging the average number of babies being born to each woman to 2.1, according to the latest federal statistics. That marks the first time since 1971 that the rate has reached a crucial benchmark of population growth: the ability of each generation to replace itself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Europe, Japan and other industrialized countries have long had fertility rates far below the replacement level, creating the prospect of labor shortages and loss of cultural identity as the proportion of native-born residents shrinks in relation to immigrant populations. In contrast, many developing nations&rsquo; birthrates far exceed the replacement rate, fueling poverty and social unrest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reasons for the unusual U.S. fertility rate are the focus of intense interest. Experts can only speculate, but they cite a complex mix of factors, including lower levels of birth control use than in other developed countries, widely held religious values that encourage childbearing, social conditions that make it easier for women to work and have families, and a growing Hispanic population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s total fertility rate hit a high of nearly 3.8 in the United States in 1957 during the postwar Baby Boom. But it fell sharply through the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of the birth control pill and other trends, including women delaying childbearing to attend college and pursue a career. The rate dipped below replacement level in 1972 and hit a low of 1.7 in 1976, but it started rising again in the late 1970s. It climbed steadily through the 1980s, hovering close to but never hitting the replacement rate throughout the &rsquo;90s. The population rose steadily nevertheless, however, because, in part, of immigration.</p>
<p>The fertility rate finally surpassed the replacement threshold again in 2006, according to a preliminary analysis of birth data released by the government this month. When the report was published, attention focused on a jump in the teen birthrate for the first time in 14 years, but the statistics show that was part of an increase in birthrates across almost all ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teenagers may have had some impact, but the birthrate went up for every group, including women in their 20s, and they account for a huge percentage of the childbearing in this country,&#8221; Ventura said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the increase is explained by immigration. Hispanics have the highest fertility rate &mdash; about 2.9 &mdash; followed by blacks (2.1), Asians (1.9) and whites (1.86). But Hispanics do not represent enough of the population to fully explain the trend, and the fertility rate of U.S. whites is still higher than that of other developed countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For developed countries, a replacement-level fertility rate is considered vital for keeping retirement programs such as Social Security solvent by supplying new workers to pay into the system to support retirees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although many European countries offer women incentives to have children, such as providing lengthy paid maternity leave, guaranteeing their jobs and subsidizing child care, the efforts have had limited impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While being a mother who works outside the home is far from easy for many American women, many experts said the United States is in many ways more amenable to the practice than many other developed countries. The high-octane consumer economy, for example, helps women run households more efficiently in a number of ways, including making prepared foods more widely available, and weekend and late-night shopping possible. American men are also helping more with their children than in the past, experts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s religiosity also contributes to the higher fertility rate, which varies geographically, experts said. Red states tend to have both more religious people and higher fertility rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans are much more religious than Europeans: They believe in God more. They go to church more,&#8221; said Charles Westoff, a Princeton University demographer. &#8220;That sort of religious attitude or set of values is strongly correlated with fertility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, the fertility rate combined with increased immigration is likely to continue to fuel growth of the U.S. population, experts said.</p>

<p>Wrong, daycare and maternity leave does work to boost fertility.</p>
<p>France, and Scandinavia have birth rates at or above 1.8 just like white Americans do.</p>
<p>What baffles me is that the US government has done little to boost the white middle class birth rate, and yet, the white birth rate is still close to replacement and higher than in other white countries that have generous welfare states.</p>
<p>Go figure.<br>

			<p> The report is encouraging   &mdash;   but only up to a point. Whites still have the lowest birth rate of all the identifiable groups, and the report says nothing about whether the White birth rate has grown, or just the overall U.S. birth rate. Hispanics and blacks having significantly higher birth rates than Caucasians can only mean that the U.S. of 2050, say, will be radically different than the one we grew up in. I, for one, don&rsquo;t relish that prospect.<br>
 For those who believe that Whites &#8220;just won&rsquo;t raise large families anymore,&#8221; we have three significant examples to prove that wrong: the Mormons, the Amish, and the Orthodox Jews, all of whom produce children in abundance and manage to feed, clothe, educate and love them well. Religious belief DOES tend to produce larger families, as was stated in the article.  </p>

			<p>I can atest to the fact that &#8220;Americans are more religious&#8221; as being true. We had a foreign exchange student stay with us from Austria, and she was surprised at the number of christian churches ina churches she saw everywhere she looked. She didn&rsquo;t think this was the situation in the U.S.</p>

			<p>The higher rates of fertility in the US for whites is due to religion.  While I&rsquo;m not a Christian, I do appreciate this about Christian whites. I had one friend in the Navy who was an Evangelical Christian and had 6 kids in 5 years of marriage (They had one set of twins).  Him and his wife&rsquo;s attitude was &#8220;we&rsquo;ll have as many kids as God wants us to.&#8221;  He&rsquo;s out of the Navy now and is a pastor of a church and is now expecting another.  They&rsquo;re on pace to having 20 kids?  They&rsquo;re of good stock too.  </p>
<p>This is why, no matter how much I disagree with Christians about many things, I always support them in the issues that concern them.  If the Christians in my town want a Nativity scene during X-Mas, I always support them.  If they&rsquo;re mad about Wal-Mart not saying merry X-mas, I got their back about that too. Thank God for the Christians having kids.</p>

			<p>One interesting thing I heard the other day was that Russia is having a crisis far worse than us.  Only one woman in three, in Russia, has children.  Since they do not have widespread access to birth control, even among the wealthy, that is odd.  It hints at lack of fertility rather than choice.</p>

<p>Herein lies the crux of EVERY problem we are having today with the &#8220;need&#8221; for immigrants which then &#8220;breeds&#8221;, literally, multi-culturalism which then requires us to take &#8220;diversity&#8221; training which then requires us to say &#8220;Happy Holidays&#8221; instead of &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; which then leads us to putting our children into private instead of public schools and build &#8220;gated communities&#8221; and on and on and on.</p>

			<p>60% of all these new kids will be raised in single parent households. They will be taught that having two mommies or two daddies is normal and that birth control is available to any 12 year olds without parental notification.<br>
     They will be taught that the worst thing in America are white males who treat minorities and women like dirt eeeeeeeveen if they don`t know they are so  doing. The &#8221; N&rsquo; word will make Mark Twain unreadable and they will be slaves to the Chineeze or Hindus.<br>
     They will be taught that owning a gun makes you a child abuser and that they should rely on the government for all problems. I am glad I`m raised up and my children are raised up. Their kids have already been propagandized by me. I did terrible things like give my grand daughters dolls and my grand sons gun sets. My liberal daughter -in-law annually is reduced to tears when I sneak the kids to the last gun show before Christmas, an eveent that I will enjoy immensly tommorrow. She really feaked when I gave her a pink handled .25 automatic last year. Merry Christmas, fanatics  one and all.<br>

<p>What would really be interesting, would be to see the breakdowns of: region, religion, education, political orientation, and occupation for whites in the USA. Please remember, that the white population (in spite of what all Marxist academics&rsquo; and other sociopolitical &ldquo;intelligentsia&rdquo; in this country, fantasize to the contrary) is very diverse in its own right. </p>
<p>My best guess is that of our country&rsquo;s whites it is the Midwest and South that have the highest fertility rates. The lowest rates are probably to be found on the coasts. With that said, one need only to travel to either of these regions, to see with their own eyes, that the average number of children among whites isn&rsquo;t 1.86. </p>
<p>It is closer to about 3.5; funny that?</p>

They forgot to add&hellip;.abortion.  A quick peak at the CDC shows that abortion hovers around 1 out of every 4 pregnancies.  That is a staggering number.</p>

<p>White fertility was being compared to hispanic fertility so I doubt that it would be hispanic white.</p>

<p>Everyone should know this, but for those who don&rsquo;t: Welfare, welfare, welfare.  Same argument as decades ago.  Cut the welfare!  </p>
<p>Poor whites will suffer, too, and won&rsquo;t be able to have as many kids, but it will diminish black and hispanic births much more.</p>

			<p>Brithrates do matter and religion helps boost white birth rates. My wife and I are Christian (Catholic).  The only white people we know with four or more children are eitehr Mormon or Catholic.  Secular people tend to have at most two children - if that.  </p>
<p>Also, ponder this. If whites had continued to have the birthrate of the 1950s, there would be 25 million more white children in America, and no need to import Mexico.    </p>

			<p>&#8220;For the first time in 35 years, the U.S. fertility rate has climbed high enough to sustain a stable population,&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly what is the definition of &#8220;Stable Population&#8221; as is implied here? <br>
If anything America is way overpopulated, and beginning to suffer the consequences of it&hellip;</p>
<p>Was America unstable in 1955 when there were only about 150 million people in America?</p>
<p>Is Ireland, with a population of about 5 million less stable than Bangladesh which has a population of 140+ million?</p>

<p>Wrong, daycare and maternity leave does work to boost fertility.</p>
<p>France, and Scandinavia have birth rates at or above 1.8 just like white Americans do.</p>
<p>France also has a LOT of blacks and Muslims who are undoubtedly artificially inflating their fertility rate. White French are probably down in the 1.6-1.7 level, if that. Although, granted, that&rsquo;s still better than Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe.</p>
<p><i>Hispanic white or non hispanic white which one is it?</i></p>
<p>After checking the CDC website, I found out that it&rsquo;s non-Hispanic white. If you include &#8220;Hispanic white&#8221; (i.e., almost all Hispanics), it&rsquo;s actually similar to the overall birth rate   &mdash;   about replacement level. (Big surprise.)</p>
<p><i>For those who believe that Whites &ldquo;just won&rsquo;t raise large families anymore,&rdquo; we have three significant examples to prove that wrong: the Mormons, the Amish, and the Orthodox Jews, all of whom produce children in abundance and manage to feed, clothe, educate and love them well. Religious belief DOES tend to produce larger families, as was stated in the article.</i></p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t forget certain conservative traditionalist Protestants and Catholics. In my town, the Reformed Calvinists appear to be slowly taking over from the aging hippy liberals because of their steady reproduction rate. They also tend to be of a very attractive stock, I might add. (My family is Catholic, but we seem to be the only traditionalist Catholics in town.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because most Russian women have abortions, which can ruin the woman&rsquo;s fertility permanently.</p>

			<p>Be aware that when government stataticians use the term &#8220;white&#8221; this may include all hispanics, or only those hispanics that call themselves white on the census (48% of hispanics self identify as white on the census). You can only trust the govenrments statistics when they use the term &#8220;white-non hispanic&#8221;. Rest assured the more obvious that White Europeans are being cleansed from America, the more your government will lie about it. </p>

			<p>There might still be hope as the Baby Boomers pass on.  Some of the damage to children and familily will correct itself but it is still probably too late.  I remember growing up in the 70&rsquo;s when the Government would encourage women to divorce the fathers of their children by offering much larger benefits for single women with children.  I really feel like I am part of a lost generation.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up too high. Whites are good in that they tend to be relatively kind and lean more toward valuing liberty than other races, but what we really need is smart whites.  Those are the most valuable types of whites to get to reproduce.  We need to make incentives that will make it more worthwile for smart whites to reproduce.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we would have needed them even with the low white birthrate.  They&rsquo;re &#8220;needed&#8221; (in plutocratic terms) because they&rsquo;re cheap labor.  Even if the white population was 30 million more, we would still &#8220;need&#8221; (in plutocratic terms) mass immigration from Mexico and Latin America, because 230 million whites in America would no more want to work cheaply than 200 million.</p>

			<p>As my parents were growing up they were told the world was going to have a population explosion and they needed to limit the number of offspring to two.  Many people did and now they look what they are telling us &#8220;We don&rsquo;t have enough&#8221;.</p>

			<p><i>Whites were producing the vast majority of children in 1976 when the birthrate was 1.76. Now it&rsquo;s 1.86. Hardly much of an increase at all.</i></p>
<p>Back in the 1960s, black Americans had birth rates similar to Africans today&hellip; and in the 1970s, it was still a ways above replacement. Mexicans had very high fertility until the 1980s. A high-fertility subset of a population tends to distort the fertility out of proportion to its numbers.</p>
<p>So, if you subtract the blacks and Mexicans, non-Hispanic white fertility in 1976 was probably about 1.65. If it&rsquo;s now in the 1.85 range, I&rsquo;d say that is a significant improvement. And, as a matter of fact, it was about 1.70 throughout most of the 1980s, and about 1.78 in the early 1990s. There&rsquo;s no increase??</p>
<p>The bottom line is&hellip; white liberals in the United States virtually stopped having children when the Pill became popular. That took fertility down, but it has been going back up as the conservatives&rsquo; children grow up and start having their own.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because Europe does not have too many conservatives, the winnowing out of the liberals will take a lot longer and European whites will take a much larger haircut to their numbers. If this turns out to be fatal, coming as it is in the face of massive Muslim and black immigration, remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>These dismal long trending statistics are probably why miscegenation is promoted so fervently.  It probably explains why black fertility rates had been trending down.  Rather than promote big White families, the liberals attempt to control the nonwhite reproduction rate.  A black man paired with a White woman would have fewer children than with a black woman.  Also, the hope that the offspring would have some of their aggressive tendencies bred out like they did with African honeybees.  Of course they hoped the large number of unmarried black women created by the marriage squeeze would become spinsters.  It only made them desperate and easy (70% illegitimacy rate).  Now that black fertility is climbing again, it&rsquo;s time to try something new that doesn&rsquo;t involve compromising our DNA.</p>

			<p>Well, so the fertility rate is up   &mdash;   but from where? Are we to assume that European women have tossed out their women&rsquo;s lib protest signs and finally remembered why they have a reproductive system?</p>
<p>Or have the female population of Harlem, Oakland, Detroit and barrios from coast to coast decided collectively to replace their quickly dying-from-crime male population? Perhaps it&rsquo;s a little late to worry about how big the US population is getting and time to concern ourselves with the quality of same and how that will affect the American future.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely one issue that we aren&rsquo;t hearing any of the Presidential hopefuls addressing. And won&rsquo;t be.</p>

			<p>&#8221;..Only one woman in three, in Russia, has children. Since they do not have widespread access to birth control, even among the wealthy, that is odd. It hints at lack of fertility rather than choice&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>More fallout from the &#8216;Workers&rsquo; Paradise&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;Russian Abortion Killing and Sterilizing Millions; Demographic Collapse Likely to be Worse than Previously Predicted&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8221;..An English language news magazine from Moscow reports that up to one third of Russian abortions result in the death of the mother&hellip; In addition, after decades of communism which endorsed abortion as a form of birth control, the physical and psychological after effects of so many millions of abortions have yet to be completely felt. Communist Soviet Union was the first nation in the world to legalize abortion in 1920.</p>
<p>Conservative estimates put the Russian abortion rate at 60% of all pregnancies, approximately a tenth of which are on girls under 18. Vladimir Kulakov, the deputy director of the Russian Women&rsquo;s Health Center says that of some 38 million women of childbearing age, about 6 million are infertile, and medical authorities consider abortions a major cause of infertility. </p>
<p>Now a new study shows that the death rate of women seeking abortion is also uncommonly high. Abortion is a dangerous invasive procedure whether legalized or not, but with much of Russian medical facilities working with antiquated equipment, many more women are dying from abortion complications in Russia than elsewhere&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say the scariest part of the article is this:</p>
<p>&#8221;..a replacement-level fertility rate is considered vital for keeping retirement programs such as Social Security solvent by supplying new workers to pay into the system to support retirees&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is going to happen when a non-White majority (circa 2050? 2030?) decides it is NOT going to support majority White retirees, especially after the ponzi-scheme SS collapses?<br>

<p>I hear people say that often.  Do all nonwhites die before they can collect Social Security?  Is that the reason they won&rsquo;t support it?  </p>
<p>Another thing that puzzles me is the dependency ratio or the number of workers it takes to support a retiree on social security. In 1950, there were 16 workers paying taxes into the system for every retiree who was taking benefits out of it. Today, there are a little more than three.  By 2050, it&rsquo;s projected to be one to one.  Our population will be double what it is today and yet I wonder if it&rsquo;s because most of those nonwhites won&rsquo;t be paying taxes or even be in the workforce.  </p>

<p>&gt; Having worked for two years in a Slavic country, I think I can help shed some light on this question.  Slavic women in general, are not promiscuous.  As difficult as it is for a Westerner or American to understand that unmarried women might not engage in that &#8220;Sex in the City&#8221; lifestyle, Slavic women are able to shun men in a remarkable way.  You can&rsquo;t ask them on a date.  If you do, they run away from you, almost literally.  On the other hand, if they are interested in you, it is difficult to ignore them.  And if you decide to break up with them, they will stalk you to the ends of the earth (almost).  I actually had one woman (my age) offer me her 17 year old daughter because she thought I would take her to California and she would have a good life with me.  The girl seemed ready to take on the duties.  Unheard of in the West.  I met young women who would not leave an abusive husband or boyfriend.  It is a different culture among Slavs than ours.</p>

			<p>Remember that fertility rate 2.1 is the replacement level. Each group with fertility less than that is shrinking and each group with fertility more than that is growing.</p>
<p>The only group, according to the above article, that is growing is &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (non-white, I presume). Blacks are stable with their fertility rate 2.1. All other groups are headed to EXTINCTION, compliments of our ruling elite&rsquo;s idiotic immigration/diversity policy, if the current trend continues long enough.</p>
<p>And calling it&rdquo;good news&#8221; is an outrageous lie that any Soviet/Nazi/Communist/Liberal propaganda guru would be proud of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that it&rsquo;s not the white&rsquo;s fertility rate 1.86 that is necessarily bad in itself, but it&rsquo;s the fact that other racial groups have higher fertility rates than whites have. And that is really BAD, particularly because these are mostly whites that are heavily subsidizing other races&rsquo; high birth rates, particularly among &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;. It&rsquo;s really suicidal. </p>
<p>The answer to the above deadly threat is not by increasing whites&rsquo; fertility rates, as it would inevitably lead to overpopulation and dramatic decrease of living standards, but to stop any and all means of subsidizing other races&rsquo; fertility. Should &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; be left without handouts, welfare, tax credits, and other freebies for themselves and their countless kids, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sustain their high fertility rates and threaten whites with extinction. It seems obvious that once the population in already overpopulated areas (virtually all livable areas in the U.S. are overpopulated) drops to rational levels, whites&rsquo; fertility rate will return to the replacement level of 2.1.<br>

What we want to know is the total number of white children being born as compared to other races as well as the white percentage of immigrants. Good luck ever seeing those.

<p>The CDC stats also include data on birth rate per man. For black men, it&rsquo;s about 2.3, and for white+Hispanic men, it&rsquo;s about 1.9. There are no stats for Asian men, but I&rsquo;m sure the only reason the TFR of Asian women is higher than white women is because at least a fifth of them are having children by white men, as well as the fact that the number of Asian (and Hispanic, Indian, and black) women in the U.S. is probably undercounted due to illegal immigration, thereby artificially inflating their TFR.</p>
<p>To answer your previous question, I&rsquo;d guess about 5% of births to white women have a black father, thus knocking our TFR down to about 1.75-1.80. (Hispanics father children by white women somewhat less, and Asians hardly at all.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about births, but I do know it&rsquo;s a fact: among Asians, born and raised in the USA, more Asian men than Asian women go on to marry a white partner. Just like some of the statistics for this article, this, apparently un-PC fact, is usually hidden from view, and easily enough being the large number of white American men marry Asians, imported from Asia. </p>

			<p>For all the talk about whites intermarrying with other groups, the fact is that 97% of whites marry whites. </p>

			<p>&#8220;To answer your previous question, I&rsquo;d guess about 5% of births to white women have a black father, thus knocking our TFR down to about 1.75-1.80.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, since there are 6 times as many white women as black, and since those children always self-identify as black, that estimate you give would increase the net black rate by 6X0.05=0.3. So it not only knocks the white rate down to 1.75 but it also ups the black rate to 2.4. Thanks to ding-a-ling white girls who buy into all the popular culture and school propaganda convincing them to be breeding mares for black males. </p>
