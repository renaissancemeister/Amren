						<p>The eight measures that China&rsquo;s government pledged to help promote the development of Africa have been implemented smoothly, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister ZhaiJun said here Tuesday. </p>
<p>China had provided assistance to 47 African countries and signed agreements with 15 countries to provide preferential loans, Zhai said in an online interview with Xinhuanet.com. </p>
<p>The foundation had been laid for building the conference center for the African Union and construction would start next year, and a China-Africa development fund is operating, he said. </p>
<p>China is working to establish trade and economic cooperation zones in Zambia, Mauritius and Nigeria and had trained 5,000 personnel in various fields for African countries, he said. </p>
<p>China has sent 75 youth volunteers to Africa and increased the number of Chinese government scholarships to African students from 2,000 up to 2,700, Zhai said. </p>
<p>Preparation for building hospitals, agricultural technology demonstration centers and malaria prevention and treatment centers is in progress, he added. </p>
<p>These measures were announced by Chinese President Hu Jintao during last year&rsquo;s Beijing Summit. The aid effort includes a package of major assistance, investment, trade and other key cooperation projects with Africa in an effort to forge a new type of strategic partnership and strengthen cooperation in more areas and at a higher level. </p>
<p>Zhai said China will work closely with African countries to earnestly and steadily fulfill the eight measures so as to benefit African countries and their people.<br>

			<p>China does not export intelligent, educated people all over the world in order to benefit the rest of the world.  These colonists are expected to help the homeland, whether by active spying or technology theft, political activity on China&rsquo;s behalf, or simply intermarrying and putting an appealing, non-threatening face on an alien  presence.  In particular, note the strong Chinese &#8220;American&#8221; support for the Clintons.  That alone is enough to prefer Barak Hussein Obama for the Democrat nomination.  </p>

			<p>An interesting example of collective Malaysian patriotism that forced their native government to do what was right for the indigenous people who elected it.  </p>
<p>It demonstrates the dangers of allowing one&rsquo;s elected leaders a free hand to do precisely as they please because unchecked avarice and uncurbed ambition will invariably enable such leaders to wilfully betray their own nations, homelands and heritages.</p>

Ethnic Upheaval</p>
<p>Malaysia Torn by Drive For More Maylay Rights At Expense of Chinese<br>
So Far, No One Is Satisfied By Government&rsquo;s Actions In Commerce, Education<br>
&#8216;Better if British Had Stayed&rsquo;</p>
<p>BY BARRY NEWMAN</p>
<p>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  &mdash;  This is a lucky country. It has a small population, rich crop-land, abundant natural resources, an efficient civil service and capable planners. Through 20 years of independence, only one thing has held Malaysia back: the race problem. </p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t an ordinary race problem. The Malays, on the one hand, have nearly half the population and most of the political power, yet they have very little of the money. The Chinese, on the other hand, are a minority and hold very little power, yet they have most of the money. </p>
<p>The Malays find themselves in an enviable position for economic underdogs: They can do something about it. With the government under their control, the Malays set about adjusting their anomalous situation a few years ago with an affirmative-action program so forceful it would probably astound black activists in the U.S. </p>
<p>In the process, the concept of equal protection under the law was qualified, racial discrimination in school admissions was legalized, and questioning of the government&rsquo;s racial policies was made an act of sedition. </p>
<p>Widespread Discontent</p>
<p>The result so far is that practically everyone is dissatisfied. Some Malays have made visible strides, but many others haven&rsquo;t seen any benefit. The Chinese, for their part, have encountered palpable privations  &mdash;  most notably their near exclusion from Malaysian universities. </p>
<p>The Chinese are being asked to cooperate, but many here wonder how long they can tolerate the discrimination. &#8220;This is my country too!&#8221; a Chinese cabby yells at his passenger. </p>
<p>&#8220;This feeling of frustration and dissatisfaction with the government,&#8221; says a Chinese chamber of commerce internal memorandum, &#8220;is an unhealthy state of affairs.&#8221; </p>
<p>Malay leaders defend the changes. &#8220;Our leaders have to think how to make this country safe for 2,000 years, not just 20 years,&#8221; says Abdul Kadir Fadzir, a politically active Malay lawyer. &#8220;A lot of people have to make short-term sacrifices. It&rsquo;s a temporary, transitional phenomenon.&#8221; </p>
<p>The British Influence</p>
<p>The Chinese account for 35% of Malaysia&rsquo;s 12.2 million people. They arrived at their unlikely position of economic might and political impotence through a quirk of colonialism. They flocked to Malaysia&rsquo;s tin mines from the north in the late 1800s, and under the British, who didn&rsquo;t leave until 1957, came to control just about everything the Westerners didn&rsquo;t. But because the Chinese were immigrants, they were kept off the land and out of the government. </p>
<p>The Malays, meanwhile, had been here; for centuries. The British ruled through the Malay sultans, granting the &#8220;sons of the soil&#8221; preferred rights of citizenship and land ownership. With independence, the government was passed on to the Malays, who now make up between 45% and 50% of the population. People from India and a variety of jungle dwellers make up the rest of the population. The Malays preserved their favored status in the new constitution and, in an unabashed gerrymander, guaranteed their own political dominance. </p>
<p>But the Malays were poor. Their agrarian ways and Islamic gentility were no match for the aggressive, urbanized Chinese. There was little hope for the Malay to break into the clannish domain of Chinese business; he stayed on the farm, tethered to a line of credit from a Chinese merchant. </p>
<p>Language Barrier</p>
<p>The races never got along. In America, blacks and whites at least speak the same language, wear the same clothes, eat the same food and often go to the same church. The Chinese and Malays haven&rsquo;t any such common ground. To the Chinese, Malays are indolent and incompetent. To the Malays, the Chinese are ruthless and unprincipled. Racial remarks roll off the tongue in Kuala Lumpur as readily as they did in America&rsquo;s Deep South in the 1950s. Years after the Malays gained control of the government, they remained in the economic back seat. Malay households earned only half as much as Chinese households 65% of the Malays lived in poverty, compared with 25% of the Chinese. In 1969, about the time affirmative action for blacks was coming into vogue in the U.S., the Malays rioted in Kuala Lumpur. </p>
<p>In a bloody amok (a Malay word) about 250 Chinese were murdered, along with 50 Malays and Indians. It was an explosion of Malay resentment that exposed, the government later concluded, &#8220;an area of weakness which undermined the very foundations of the nation.&#8221; </p>
<p>A year later, affirmative action came to Malaysia in earnest. The government proclaimed a &#8220;New Economic Policy.&#8221; Its objective: to &#8220;ensure the creation of a Malay commercial and industrial community in all categories and at all levels of operation, in order that within one generation Malays and other indigenous people can be full partners in the economic life of the nation.&#8221; </p>
<p>By 1990, the government resolved, Malays&rsquo; participation in every educational, professional and commercial field would match their share of the population- about half. And Malays would own 30% of the country&rsquo;s capital. If they couldn&rsquo;t buy it themselves, the government would buy it for them. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Two years ago, the government gave itself a more persuasive tool: a sweeping law, tied to the racial policies, requiring licenses for most factories. A manufacturer who doesn&rsquo;t make an effort to comply might end up making nothing.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>When the British were here, for more than a century, they sent Malays to Malay primary schools and taught them in the Malay language. Education ended there. The British &#8220;protected&#8221; the Moslem Malays from Christian missionaries; the Chinese, unprotected, went to mission schools taught in English. The University of Malaya used English from the start and, naturally, the student body was overwhelmingly Chinese. </p>
<p>In 1969, the government decided to make Malay the language of instruction; the switch will be complete in 1982. The university population has since multiplied tenfold, to 31,000, and new students have been predominantly Malays. They now account for 70% of the student population. Of 5,700 freshmen admitted this school year, only 1,200 were Chinese.</p>
<p>The No Merit System</p>
<p>The mechanism for doing this makes American affirmative action pale by comparison. The constitution was simply amended to allow Malays a &#8220;reasonable proportion&#8221; of every entering class. The quality of the competition doesn&rsquo;t matter. &#8220;On strict merit, we could give all our places to non-Malays,&#8221; says Rahim Mohkzani, deputy vice chancellor at the University of Malaya. As it is, thousands of qualified Chinese are being turned away. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While Malay unemployment is down to about 7%, Chinese unemployment is up to around 8%. Domestic investment (most of it from Chinese industrialists) is dropping. Wealthier Chinese students  &mdash;  about 25,000 of them-have departed in droves for universities in the West. Some Chinese with marketable skills are said to have left the country; many others say they would like to. </p>
<p>Potential for Backlash</p>
<p>The government is all too aware of the potential for backlash. Lately, it has softened its rhetoric on Malay privilege and placed fresh emphasis on the need for national unity. Yet, at the same time it is being pulled in the opposite direction by impatient Malays who see the government&rsquo;s programs as benefiting a small group of well-placed entrepreneurs and doing little for the majority still trapped in rural poverty.</p>

			<p>Well, i think we are smart enough to deal with the chinese. Come on, we aren&rsquo;t lower IQ SE Asians. Chinese population never got a major foothold in Korea or Japan and they&rsquo;ve been dealing with them for thousands of yrs. I still have confidence that white society can absorb and nullify chinese immigration but as long as we don&rsquo;t allow too many into America. It&rsquo;s all in the numbers!!</p>

<p> You are wrong. The Japanese have not been dealing with the Chinese for &#8220;thousands&#8221; of years. The Japanese lived for ages as though they were the only people in the world. This only changed in 1854 when Perry went there. As for Korea they didn&rsquo;t call it the &#8216;hermit kingdom&rsquo; for nothing. There is ONE Asian country where the Chinese have been involved for at least a thousand years though, Vietnam. By the way, Vietnamese and Chinese loath each other. You are right when you say it is all about the numbers but here&rsquo;s the problem. Once you let a few of them in, it always becomes more and more. It&rsquo;s like the Camel&rsquo;s nose in the tent.</p>

			<p>The Chinese population appears to be &#8216;exploding&rsquo; all over the UK.  Here in Liverpool, where there&rsquo;s been a small, rather quaint abberation of a Chinese community for a long time, they have suddenly burgeoned.  This has coincided with the entire city getting an ethnic makeover since I left 20 years ago. They fit into the here-to-stay category with the Africans, Arabs, Turks etc. ie, unlike the Poles and Czechs, they&rsquo;re all pushing prams.  I imagine with the Orientalisation of Africa, we&rsquo;ll see Afro-Chinese ethnic conflict in the West. Yet another addition to the pantheon of causes of the fall of Western civilisation.  Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Not entirely so.  It&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>
<p>Actually, Japan had the closed-door policy for only  a couple of centuries (1635-1853).  There was contact with China long before that (and even during it). In the closed period, Japan was mainly closed to the WESTERN powers, which it was well aware were expanding their influence and colonies all around the Pacific Rim, and Japan wanted to avoid the fate of becoming a colony like the Philippines.  But throughout it, Japan still maintained trade and contacts with China.   </p>
<p><i>&#8220;[In] the early part of the 17th century, the shogunate suspected that the traders and missionaries were actually forerunners of a military conquest by European powers.    However, during the period of isolation (sakoku) that began in 1635, Japan was much less cut off from the rest of the world than is commonly assumed.&#8221;</i><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Japan" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Japan</a></p>
<p>As for Korea, it had been invaded by the Mings, Mongols and Manchus, as well as by Japan (1592), even (briefly) by the French (1866) and Americans (1871).  Europeans were not allowed to trade at Korean ports until the 1880s, but it had long been within the Chinese sphere of influence.  China was displaced by Japan only when Japan forced Korea to open its ports in 1876.   During the 19th century, Korea had tried to control foreign influence by closing the borders to all nations but China.  Korea  was a  basically satellite state of the Quing Dynasty (since 1636).<br>

This will show if we deserve to exist as a white society or not. If this is allowed then it&rsquo;s time for whites to give in and merge with the asians. Are we smart enough to survive, this is the question.<br>

<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, its already happened in Far East Russia and Siberia. Where have you been? The Los Angeles Times, the shill rag for the neocons, ran an extensive series of articles on this about 6 years ago.</p>

			<p>Red China is a hard-core communist nation and I don&rsquo;t remember hearing Washington officially announce that communism is no longer a global threat to liberty.  After all, Washington spent literally trillions of our tax dollars to &#8220;defend&#8221; us against a bogus foreign communist invasion during the cold war while ignoring the very real and all-pervasive internal communist threat.  Treason has long been one of the highest paying enterprises in America and it has made our seditious members of congress and our presidents fabulously wealthy&hellip;</p>

<p>?? I think the poster was originally talking about the West. Russia has always been partially Asian &amp; yes they will be ruled by E. Asians pretty soon I&rsquo;m sure. I heard many white Russian women are trying desperately to rustle up Japanese or S. Korean husbands since the Russian men are abusive, alcoholic, and broken. I heard that there are huge influx of Russian prostitutes in these countries and the E. Asians despises them. They now automatically link white women and propstitutes due to these women.</p>
<p>Are u saying that what happens to Russians will happen to us or what is your point?</p>

<p>It seems that concern has been discretely muffled since we&rsquo;ve become such good customers of communist China.  The regimes in power in Peking and Washington are the best of business buddies.   Indeed, we are now their debtors,  in their hock for trillions.</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t my original intention, but now that you mention it, you are actually making a very important point. Because as I see it, the greatest blind spot in white people&rsquo;s eyes is that they don&rsquo;t see the connection between other white nations&rsquo; fate tied to their own. In essence, they rationalize: &#8220;well thats terrible, but we aren&rsquo;t Russian, we aren&rsquo;t French, Dutch, or  Afrikaner, etc.. so why should we be concerned? We are special, it won&rsquo;t happen to us.&#8221;  I believe that this emotional anesthesia toward one another&rsquo;s fate(they use the euphemism:&#8221;individuality&#8221;) is what will doom the white race.   The Russians suffer their fate because whites in the West are deluded into thinking they are the enemy; they engage in great media campaigns for raising millions of dollars for destitute Africans ( TV ads ), while spending millions more for missiles and bombs pointed at their slavic white brothers.  To me, this goes beyond stupidity- it borders on insanity.  It all comes down to whether you have the ability to recognize your own genetic kin.Without this instinctive racial self recognition &#8220;software&#8221; in your brain ( which asians have in abundance )you are vulnerable to manipulation and destruction by other, more cunning races who DO have this ability. </p>
<p>EX: I recently saw a nature program on TV; a Japanese monk who dedicates his life to cultivating European honey bees.  A species of giant hornets regularly intrude on its territory to feed on its larva, and devastate its colony; only a few European bees venture outside to challenge the hornet, to no effect   &mdash;  - ie, the<br>
response is too little, too late.  Another hornet scouts a Japanese bee hive. The response? - the entire hive is instantly alerted; they wait patiently till the hornet is lured inside the confines. Then they suddenly pounce on it in a frenzied, unified swarm; the hornet is literally cooked to death by the rapid rise in temperature produced by the bees.   Perhaps this analogy is imperfect. But I can tell you from my personal interaction with white people; it is this very lack of unified, instinctual reaction that I believe will slowly, imperceptively destroy them and their posterity.<br>

<p>By the way, no sane person &#8220;chooses&#8221; to be a prostitute. This is just a euphemism for slavery, where one racial group conquers another by force, whether militarily or economically, and partakes of the spoils.  White people are extremely uncomfortable with the notion that they can be slaves ( especially in our modern era ), so they contort themselves verbally to come up with less painful labels. &#8221; Prostitute&#8221; is a word that gives them a false sense that somehow it is a voluntary state. The fact is - ANY human on earth, reagrdless of race, ethnicity, or cultural background will fall victim if they cannot defend themselves against other marauding races.  Deep down, everyone knows how serious the stakes are, and thats why a site such as AMREN exists   &mdash;   whites know they are not excempt from the law of the jungle.</p>

<p>You have an excellent point there. But this is just human psychology, not necessarily a white flaw as you imply. <br>
  <br>
There is an instinctual tendency to &#8220;blame the victim.&#8221;   This is well known to psychologists and police officers.   People tend to say, &#8220;Well what were you doing in that part of town?&#8221; or &#8220;What were you doing out at that hour?&#8221;  or &#8220;Why were you dressed in that kind of clothing?&#8221;  Or on that street,  etc, etc.  </p>
<p>The need is to reassure themselves by rationalizing that this awful thing couldn&rsquo;t possibly happen to them because they have more sense than the silly victim who came to grief.  Therefore, their attitude toward the victim tends to be, &#8220;It&rsquo;s all YOUR fault; you&rsquo;re getting what you deserve, you fool.  You MADE this happen to you.  You didn&rsquo;t think ahead  [like I would].  You were just stupid.&#8221;    We all like to hink we&rsquo;re too smart for such things to happen to us.</p>
<p>Consequently, victims (both as individuals and nations) often get very little sympathy from others, unless they are our own relatives or we can see ourselves in their shoes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Then they suddenly pounce on it in a frenzied, unified swarm; the hornet is literally cooked to death by the rapid rise in temperature produced by the bees. Perhaps this analogy is imperfect. But I can tell you from my personal interaction with white people; it is this very lack of unified, instinctual reaction that I believe will slowly, imperceptively destroy them and their posterity.&#8221;Posted by at 8:24 PM<br>

<p>Thanks for an interesting analogy.  It&rsquo;s something to think about. All my life I have read about western society and its achievements being due to our unique emphasis on the individual - going all the way back to the Vikings and beyond to the Greeks of Alexander and to Homer&rsquo;s time.  </p>
<p>By contrast, those books and articles more or less subtly looked down on Oriental and other societies as being too communally oriented, &#8220;communistic&#8221;,  and little more than human ant hills where individualism was suppressed for the benefit of the larger community, implying that this is the reason for their &#8220;backwardness&#8221; or relative lack of achievement.  Among whites you have strong competition. Among Orientals you have strong emphasis on consensus. Aggressive individualism and competitiveness would appear unseemly to them.</p>
<p>In such articles and textbooks, this important difference that apparently elevated us was always assumed to be superior and was praised. Now, you&rsquo;re making me wonder if, just maybe,  that same selfish individualism and lack of community spirit will prove to be our failing.  The bee hive may turn out to be superior after all.</p>

			<p>Africa is not the only place China is on the move. China is strangling Taiwan in Central America, getting Central American nations to disengage with Taiwan and commit instead to Mainland China. Bit of an ugly business. The article is in the Japanese online newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Sept 2007. BTW lots is going on between Japan, Korea, and mainland China, and brave little Japan is trying to fight back, with a series of history articles in Asahi Shimbun. Well, it&rsquo;s brave and it&rsquo;s little, compared to the array forces forming against it, today, including Steven Spielberg making films to remind the Chinese of the awful things the Japanese did to them in the past. Here is the Central America article. <a href="https://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200709060059.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200709060059.html</a>  </p>

			<p>A lot of defeatism on this board. </p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>1) The Russian far East is not the Russian West.  Russia has the largest most homogeneous European population in the World and The largest European cities in the World.  We in American forget that.  Go there and look around.  We in America have the largest European Population but we are saddled with all kinds of garbage like Social Engineering, Neocons in Charge etc&hellip;etc&hellip;</p>
<p>2) No one and I mean no one on earth has American or Russian weapons capability and they are not going to them.  It is genetic  &mdash;  -80% of any European Tribes survival is based on defense NOT birthrates.  We have been killed off by everything imaginable and are still here.  We must go into some kind of consolidation.  We are too spread out over massive tracts of land. </p>
<p>3) The Chinese have one of the most aggressively Asian populations in the World.  And yes, they are taking Africa.  They must have resources.  They cannot take Siberia without getting Nuked.  Furthermore, they can buy things in Siberia.  Africa has no defense. </p>
<p>4)Lets start concerning ourselves with what we are going to do when this current fantasy phase of the West comes to an end.  It will  &mdash;    &mdash;  this will end like Communism with a Self Hating White falling.  The Non-White world is much more afraid of our weaponry then we should ever be of their birthrates.</p>

			<p>I think that, on the pretext of rescuing African Whites from genocide, the White nations should simply seize the habitable parts of the continent, the south and east.  We don&rsquo;t need to rule the locals, just control certain enclaves that will ensure our ability to strike as we need to.  A fig leaf of legality can be purchased from the ruling chiefs, some sort of thousand year leases, and treaties to guarantee us a commercial monopoly.  Let&rsquo;s not be sentimental.  The Blacks are a failed race, and their homeland will be claimed by others.  Our own racial interests require us, if nothing else, to keep the Chinese and Indians out.  They are no worse than us in this regard, it is simply a race to secure resources for our progeny.  Some posters, I know, would rather we washed our hands of Africa entirely, regarding it as a money drain.  But recall the Louisiana Purchase, an enormous expense, for more land than we knew what to do with.  But a healthy, procreative, White society quickly found use for it.  So would we for those millions of square miles of potentially fertile land.  Fertile, that is, when it&rsquo;s filled with Whites.  </p>

<p>Problem is: they are busy acquiring our weaponry, while we are not adquiring their birth rates.<br>
