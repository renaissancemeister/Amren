						<p>Illegal aliens are a net drain on state and local governments, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that found the federal government does not do enough to help offset those costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants,&#8221; CBO said in its review, released yesterday.</p>
<p>The CBO report, which looked at a series of state analyses, said it&rsquo;s difficult to calculate the exact cost, but noted the overall total net loss &#8220;is most likely modest.&#8221; Still, the report said, that varies state-by-state, with some states saying they get more from taxes paid by illegal aliens than they spend on services for them.</p>
<p>Those costs come in three main areas, the CBO found: education, health care and law enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From the other side of the debate, Steven A. Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said while the costs from illegal aliens may be modest, that ignores the costs of their citizen children, who he said must be counted because if their parents weren&rsquo;t here illegally the children wouldn&rsquo;t be either.</p>
<p>Mr. Camarota said the cost of educating illegal alien students runs about $15 billion a year, but that figure doubles if the legal children of illegal aliens are included. He also said the studies don&rsquo;t calculate illegal aliens&rsquo; impact as users of roads and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano signed an agreement committing Arizona to issue enhanced driver&rsquo;s licenses that meet the stricter requirements for international travel, and committing eventually to meet the requirements of Real ID.</p>

			<p>This is no surprise to many and certainly me.  Not mentioned is the cost to Americans of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness (to put it in a real constitutional sense).  I could recount dozens of cases of beating, robbery (myself three times), rape and murder by both illegal and &#8220;legal&#8221; Hispanics.  They are natural gangs because they always have been meek when alone but grow bold and ferocious in groups.  I have noted that all my life as a boy with Mexican friends and later as more poured into California.  A safe life there is almost impossible in many areas now.  And freedom to safely walk the streets, even in daylight is gone.</p>
<p>So I wonder when the tide of public opinion will rise enough to cease any and all Latin American immigration and repatriate all those since Regan&rsquo;s 1986 blunder?  At some point it has to be clear that a slow genocide is underway against whites and the assault is coming from institutions of the government and media as well as the Hisptanics themselves.  It has to be clear that the choice is that is what we are looking at; a reverse to save the native whites of America, or a trade for an expansion of Latin America, eliminating all that went before here.</p>

			<p>Add welfare and all that goes with it to that list. OH, and don&rsquo;t forget the countless crimes they commit and the costs emotionally and in every other way to the families of those victims. Can&rsquo;t put a price tag on that. </p>

<p>While it may be true minorities are an economic liability (who knew?), think of how en&rsquo;rich&rsquo;ed we are to have them here. Surely we are &#8216;rich&rsquo;er for their presence, no?</p>

			<p>If an accurate accounting were made, I think all states would show that the illegals result in a net loss to the states. Most of these people are paid in cash to avoid payment of taxes so that their wages are not subject to the regular taxes. They pay sales taxes but that is about all. The consume public services at an inordinate rate, using emergency room services in place of a personal physician in most cases among other problems. In most cases they drive without automobile insurance, so that if they are involved in a collision, it is the other party that must foot the bill regardless where the blame lies. In short, they do not uphold their part of the the civic contract by virtue of their illegal presence in this country and consequently they cost the country severely. This must come to an end soon.</p>

			<p>Illegals have no rights in our country.  I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re from Mexico, Peru, Venzula, Canada, Lebanon, wherever.  We as American Citizens should not have to educate illegals.  If they come here legally, do the proper paper work to make their stay legal, then God Bless them.  However, if they are illegals they should be removed back to their own country and not allowed to return until they can SPEAK ENGLISH, NO. 1., and are prepared to do the paperwork necessary to stay here legally and abide by our laws.  Our schools, hospitals, jails are overloaded with illegal, the cost of eduction prevents our being able to properly educate our Citizens and provide the best education possible to them.  Our hospitals are loosing millions of dollars annually in care for the illegals, which is never paid back, but we American&rsquo;s have to pay.  Our jails are full, our prisons are full, and it cost each state a great deal of money to house and feed, meet the medical needs and guard these illegal individuals that shouldn&rsquo;t be here to begin with.  </p>
<p>Every dime of the American money being spent as outlined above takes away from the American People.  Look at any court calendar in the country, a high precentage of the names are foreigners, and it&rsquo;s unknown if they are legal or illegal in our country.  The Police Depts. Sheriff&rsquo;s Depts. State Police dont take the time to check it out, and if they did, would they report it to ICE so the individual could be picked up and removed from our country when the time was right?  I seriously doubt that will happen. </p>
<p>Why are Illegals allowed bond for their crimes? </p>
<p>What is the bond for an illegal? </p>
<p>You simply turn them over to the Federal Government, let them hold them, that will save on local housing expenses, but no one does that.  ICE and or Federal Marshall&rsquo;s can transport them to and from their hearings, and if evidence is in hand with the Feds that the individual is in fact an illegal, I believe it would be cheaper for our judges to find them guilty, waive the jail time, unless they are later caught back in our country, they should have to serve the time originally sentenced.  Let ICE take them to the FEDS for Deportation from the U.S.  This would cut down on a lot of local and state expenses for housing, food, medical, guards,etc., and put the expense on our federal government where it should be.  If INS Deports that individual, and he is every found in the U.S. again illegally, then he should serve the max. sentence and be deported immediately upon release.  If necessary, we should implant some type of electronic tracing gadget in that individual before they&rsquo;re deported, and if he&rsquo;s returned, it would be recognized and we would automatically know what to do with them.  This would make it a lot less attractive for them to want to come rushing back to the U.S.  Hey, anythings worth a try.  Put me in charge and I&rsquo;ll write is so everyone understands whats to be done, and I&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s done.  It would take a few months, but we could clean the United States of all illegals, not just the Mexicans.  I&rsquo;m more afraid of every Middle Easterner running every convenience store in our country than the Mexicans, but am willing to start on any street corner and get the job done.</p>
<p>As an ex-Police Officer, I&rsquo;m not the usual &#8220;nana&#8221; but I&rsquo;m lik&#8221;e a &#8220;Tenacious Bull Dog&#8221;  and you can bet the job would be done, and done right.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous. The overwhelming majority of ILLEGALS are either paid under the table in cash, or are making not far from minimum wage. This means the taxes taken from them in their check are returned to them when they file.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those costs come in three main areas, the CBO found: education, health care and law enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this doesnt even include costs like section 8 housing, food stamps, etc. And dont tell me ILLEGALS cant get these services. I know better.</p>

			<p><i>Mr. Camarota said the cost of educating illegal alien students runs about $15 billion a year, but that figure doubles if the legal children of illegal aliens are included.</i></p>
<p>The idea that illegals pay more in taxes than they get in services is preposterous. Any state saying that should be sued for lying to its citizens. A single child of an illegal alien will cost an average of $7,000 a year to educate. In many cases we won&rsquo;t get that money back because the kids of illegals have very high dropout rates.</p>
<p>If the kid ends up going to jail - kids of illegals have very high incarceration rates - he&rsquo;ll cost at least $20,000 a year, not to mention the social cost of whatever crime he committed to send him there.</p>
<p><i>He also said the studies don&rsquo;t calculate illegal aliens&rsquo; impact as users of roads and other infrastructure.</i></p>
<p>Those costs are enormous and real. Widening just a few miles of interstate costs hundreds of millions of dollars. They finished such a project in my town just 5 years ago and it was enormously expensive and already it&rsquo;s suffering from gridlock again.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I guess if you exlcude the burdens illegals put on hospitals, roads, schools, jails, and a few other things - well, yeah they pay more in taxes than they take out. So do I. So does everyone else, in fact. Deficit? We shouldn&rsquo;t have a deficit! We should have a $3 trillion surplus.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Most of these people are paid in cash to avoid payment of taxes so that their wages are not subject to the regular taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they are paid by check, they fill out their W-4 form with 10 deductions.  This means that no state of federal income tax is withheld until about $25,000 per year.  And until about $40,000 per year the income tax is minimal.</p>
<p>So even if they are in the system, they still nothing but sales tax.</p>
<p>I wonder how many pollution spewing $300,000 apiece buses American cities have had to buy in the past 20 years to accommodate the millions of immigrants?  Billions and billions of dollars worth of buses.  And vast amounts of pollution that the earth worshippers refuse to admit is caused by millions of immigrants using millions and millions of cars, trucks and buses ever day.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigration is a priori a net drain on society.  If it wasn&rsquo;t, cities like Los Angeles, Houston, and San Diego would be awash in money, their schools would be incredibly well funded, their hospitals would be the envy of the world, and their social services would be unparallelled.  As it is, many US cities are operating in the red.  The only reason can be the massive influx of taxusers who don&rsquo;t pay back into the system.  Therefore, the argument immigration not only supports itself financially, but benefits the tax coffers, is patently false.</p>

			<p>The only good news I can see in any of this is that &#8220;The Washington Times&#8221; is increasingly reporting honest news about the illegal invasion. They have twice in the last six months published excellent pieces about &#8220;Importing Poverty&#8221; (both in the AmRen archives).  The only downside is that in one of those articles the writer just HAD to pay homage to legal immigration when in fact their is NO difference.  We are importing poverty with BOTH and destroying our country either way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal aliens are a net drain on state and local governments, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that found the federal government does not do enough to help offset those costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a clever, manipulative tactic the Marxists use to help us forget that it is &#8220;we the people&#8221; bearing the unsustainable fiscal and social costs of our our insane immigration policies, and not some benevolent &#8220;federal government.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Hispanics have all of Latin America from Mexico to Argentina in which to live and prosper.  They collectively have far more natural resources than we do.  They have no legitimate reason to invade our country and loot what our people have built for themselves.  They want to colonize the US and Canada to achieve their goal of a totally Hispanic Western Hemisphere.  This invasion of our country by Hispanic aliens is an act of war and as such we have the right and responsibility to destroy these enemies wherever and whenever we find them&hellip;</p>
