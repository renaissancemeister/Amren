						<p>Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe is telling a provincial commission that Quebec must be exempt from Canadian multiculturalism laws so the province can protect its own culture.</p>

&#8220;Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe is telling a provincial commission that Quebec must be exempt from Canadian multiculturalism laws so the province can protect its own culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank goodness there still exist some few White ethnic groups willing to stand up to confront the &#8220;culture of surrender&#8221; of the cowardly elderly 60&rsquo;s 70&rsquo;s &#8220;Better Red than dead&#8221; crowd (now in power) that have so harmed White civilization. </p>
<p>Three cheers to the Quebecquers who refuse to lay down their language and their culture for the sake of a &#8220;peaceful surrender&#8221; of their children&rsquo;s and their posterity&rsquo;s heritage.</p>

			<p>If the Quebecois want to preserve their culture, they should forget about integrating non-Whites and start helping the other Whites to defend their race.  If you teach non-Whites to speak French, you get Haiti or Algeria, or maybe modern Paris.</p>

			<p>It may well turn out to be the Quebecois who save Canada from multicultural anilhilation.  Remember, the Quebecois were there before the British and as a result, have a deep sense of themselves as Quebecois - French Canadians.</p>
<p>Since I am descended from Quebecois, I may be a little biased.  But I just reviewed a great bit of online history of the Quebecois.  They actually decided to use King&rsquo;s French, that is the French used by at the Royal Court in the 17 century when the first French were settling in Quebec.  The problem of many dialects in a small area was solved this way.  So the Quebecois is actually more traditional French than the bourgeoise French that became preferred after the French Revolution.  There is a big movement to preserve that tradition against the erosions and pressures that face it now.  Quebecois, like me are often blue eyed, rosy cheeked, attractive people, who are unmistakeningly white.  Most Quebecois came from Normandy, which is where my own line came from.  If you know your history, the Normans descend from a combination of Franks (German Tribe that founded France) and Viking Scandinavian settlers.  So when considering the French Canadian &#8220;problem,&#8221; it is good to remember that these people are white and just happen to speak King&rsquo;s French and wish to preserve their identity just as English descended whites wich to.  (The other side of my family is descended from very early English setters (Rev. Thomas Carter - 1630), so I can see the impotance and common thread in both colonial linguistic camps of tradition.  But both are faced with a much more insidious and threatening element today; the Canadian goverments insistence on importing third world non-whites and forcing them onto the Canadian population.</p>

			<p>This is from Canada???  What a hoot!  Who would have thought those Socialists would eschew multiculturalism?</p>
<p>Though to be fair, the French Canadians are inherently already eschewing multiculturalism.  How ironic that they are more courageous than their European French brethren&hellip;</p>

			<p>What a scream &hellip; the thin edge of multiculturalism in Canada was the imposition of bi-culturalism and bi-lingualism upon the &#8220;ROC&#8221; = the Rest of Canada, back in the 60s by race traitor Pierre Trudeau<br>
the French Canadians were only too happy that a government class was created just to accomodate them &hellip;. now they don&rsquo;t like it when it comes back to haunt them?</p>
<p>Multi-cultural-ism is nothing but multi-faith-ism in disguise, calculated for over a century to dispossess white people who carry Christianity in our genes</p>

			<p>The Bouchard-Taylor commission is a landmark in Canadian politics.  </p>
<p>For the first time, multiculturalism and immigration have been put on public trial and found to be against the wishes of the majority of whites.  </p>
<p>As an exercise in direct democracy, the people have spoken, and said, &#8220;We aren&rsquo;t afraid of being called racists anymore. Enough is enough&#8221;.</p>

<p>Any politician that believes a nation must adapt any at all to minorities is one that is a worst enemy to its people than any they have faced on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Wow! You know things are getting serious when the Canadian state has to send in two of its most decorated goons. I mean, Taylor wrote the book on Multiculturalism, &hellip;literally. He&rsquo;s basically the pope of Canadian Multiculturalism. </p>

Duceppe says Quebec needs to integrate immigrants to secure the future of the French language and francophone culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>It does not work in the rest of Canada either!</p>
<p>But Duceppe is a fool for saying to integrate immigrants.  The fact is that the new breed of immigrant does NOT want to integrate, they want to takeover!</p>
<p>Trudeau&rsquo;s communist agenda is comming to pass.  And the French in Canada are wasting their effort fighting the English.  As the French continue to push their agenda on the rest of Canada the undesirable trash coming into this country is making the biggest gain.</p>
<p>Canada and Quebec are doomed, unless drastic and draconian action is taken very soon.</p>
<p>In fact Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal as well as some suburbs of these cities are already lost.</p>
<p>Duceppe is just playing the political game, but fully intends to do nothing but to allow things to get worse.  If he was serious he would start talking about stopping immigration and deporting them.  And then following through with ACTION!<br>

			<p>As a Canadian, I am grateful that Quebec is pushing the envelope re: multiculturalism. I just wish this initiative would spread to the rest of Canada and also to the United States. If the politicians could see how ordinary people really feel about multiculturalism and uncontrolled immigration complete with no assimilation, maybe then they&rsquo;d do something about it. Right now, the Canadian newspaper columnists are mostly shocked at the issues arising from the Quebec hearings on cultural accommodation, but I&rsquo;m not. It&rsquo;s called grassroots populism, and those Quebecers who denigrate multiculturalism are simply expressing how I also feel.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What a scream &hellip; the thin edge of multiculturalism in Canada was the imposition of bi-culturalism and bi-lingualism upon the &ldquo;ROC&rdquo; = the Rest of Canada, back in the 60s&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1960s, multiculturalism was sold to English Canadians as a way to fight biculturalism. French Canadians have never supported multiculturalism. If there is one issue that will split Canada apart, this will probably be it. I suspect that many English Canadians will be so blinded by their anti-Quebec bias that they will back a military intervention to &#8220;save&#8221; Quebec&rsquo;s minorities.</p>
<p>I have lived in both parts of Canada and, frankly, I am more optimistic about the future of French Canada. In Quebec, there is open debate about the pros and cons of immigration, &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221;, and multiculturalism. In English Canada, there is no debate. The media blackout is eerily like what used to exist in Eastern Europe. </p>
<p>This is partly because English Canadians are pathologically polite and feel guilty about making &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; criticism of immigrants. This is also because the political and intellectual classes of English Canada feel little kinship with the common, everyday Canadian. The two groups live and move in completely different worlds. This is much less true in French Canada,where there is a strong unity of purpose between the two groups.  </p>

			<p>When whites turn from racism to the idea that multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work for any ethnic group mixture, and that a healthy state reflects culture, language, values and genetics, then victory will be at hand.</p>
<p>Until then, we&rsquo;re batting around ideas in the wind.</p>

			<p>One thing Quebequois have that the reat of White Canada do not is a sense of themselves as a PEOPLE. <br>
 It was, however, one of their own Marxist, elitist politicians, the truly EVIL Trudeau who introduced the odius and divisive Church of Multiculturalism to Canada, as a whole, in the first place.<br>
 As a second point, the leftist Bloc want to preserve only the French LANGUAGE&hellip;.they preferr to import black, and middle eastern muslims who can speak their language but who will NEVER &#8220;integrate&#8221; into Quebec society.<br>
 However I do believe White Quebecers might have a chance to continue to exist if they seperate from the decaying multicultural hell that is the rest of Canada.<br>
 And when they do, Canada as a country will die. The West will follow their lead, and what is left, the stinking marxist multiculti Ontario will quickly spiral down the hole&hellip;.which they are already circling anyway.<br>
 Canada is doomed, as are the sheeple who are the Whites of Canada.<br>

			<p>A few comments.</p>
<p>1) On the one hand we are told that Canada &#8220;IS&#8221; a multicultural county, but Quebec which IS part of Canada is not.</p>
<p>2) It is ironic that Quebec is rejecting &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; when Quebec is almost entirerly responsible for its creation. The non-assimialation of Francophones was an immeasurable disaster for Canada and paved the way for the cultural and racial mess that is Canada today.</p>
<p>3) In general Francophone elites are more connected with the rank and file then has historically been the case with Anglophones. The one exception was Pierre Trudeau. He was a disaster for both communities. He frustrated Quebec national identity while flooding Canada with non-Whites. He was the worst Prime minister ever.</p>
<p>4) The only long-term way for Quebec to preserve it&rsquo;s heritage is to separate. Quebec is steadily losing it&rsquo;s share of Canada&rsquo;s population and this will translate into political impotence at some point. The next census will add 22 seats to the house of commons all OUTSIDE Quebec.</p>

			<p>In Quebec everyone should learn at least minimal French.  It&rsquo;s unreasonable not to expect that anyone, including an Anglophone, should try to learn French if they live and work in Quebec; by the same token, it should be expected that anyone living in the other Anglophonic provinces should learn English and that should include the Quebecoises.</p>

<p> Unfortunately Canada&rsquo;s language laws are exactly the opposite of what you suggest. Instead of having Swiss-style &#8216;territorial unilingualism&rsquo; we have ocean to ocean and U.S. border to North Pole bilingualism, at fantastic cost to the Canadian taxpayers.</p>

			<p>It should be noted that this is an about-face for nationalist Quebec.</p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s, it was the Parti Quebecois, the party of Quebec nationalism, who held the door open for Haitian thugs.  By the 1990&rsquo;s, the Haitians were destroying neighborhoods, pimping underage Quebecois girls and dealing drugs in street gangs.</p>
<p>There are none so fervent as those who&rsquo;ve seen the error of their ways and had a change of heart.</p>

<p>And I find, frankly, that it is eerie even reading about it!<br>
Who would have though this could ever happen to our northern neighbor?  I remember reading a novel, years ago, by Sinclair Lewis, &#8220;It Can&rsquo;t Happen Here&#8221;,  describing a totalitarian take-over of the United States and how patriots and guerrillas were fleeing across the border into a still-free Canada.  <br>
Now, it&rsquo;s starting to look like quite the reverse.</p>

			<p>There is a certain irony here. Traditionally Quebec was the KEY BULWARK for the federal Liberal party. This party was solely responsible for changing Canada&rsquo;s immigration laws, flooding the country with non-Whites and inventing Multiculturalism. Quebec has also given Canada more then it&rsquo;s fair share of wierd or mediocre politicians particularly Pierre Trudeau. Quebec was almost solely responsible for keeping him in power after 1968. He caused immense damage to Canada and also greatly retarded Quebec&rsquo;s national development.</p>
