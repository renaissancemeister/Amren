						<p>Two days after naming its mascot &#8220;PorkChop,&#8221; the Philadelphia Phillies&rsquo; new Triple-A affiliate abruptly dropped the moniker after receiving complaints from Hispanics that it was offensive.</p>
<p>The Lehigh Valley IronPigs, whose mascot is a large, furry pig, had selected PorkChop from more than 7,300 fan submissions. The team, which begins play in 2008, announced Monday that the mascot will be named &#8220;Ferrous&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>General Manager Kurt Landes said he heard from several Hispanics who said PorkChop was derogatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really unaware of any negative connotations with the word &lsquo;pork chop,&#8221;&rsquo; he said. &#8220;If it offended a few, it&rsquo;s a few too many.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guillermo Lopez, vice president of the Latino Leadership Alliance, said he was called &#8220;pork chop&#8221; when he worked at Bethlehem Steel decades ago.</p>

					<p>Allentown, PA (where the Iron Pigs team &amp; stadium is located) has a 24.4% Latino population (growing daily). 25% of its population is below poverty level and Allentown&rsquo;s 2006 crime incidents (murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, arsons, auto thefts) totals 601.1 for the year 2006.  <br>
<a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Allentown-Pennsylvania.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.city-data.com/city/Allentown-Pennsylvania.html</a></p>
<p>Allentown used to be a nice small city (50 years ago) but has deteriorated greatly.</p>
<p>As soon as the &ldquo;PorkChop&rdquo; name was announced, Lehigh Valley whites wondered how long it would take for the Latino population to howl. </p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re waiting for blacks to be outraged because the Iron Pigs mascot has a dark fur face.<br>

<p>There is a Mexican bazaar store in St. Louis City called &#8220;Gringo Jones.&#8221;  They should change it because &#8220;gringo&#8221; is an anti-white slur.</p>

<p>People have called me a &#8220;jerk&#8221; before. Does that mean that &#8220;jerk&#8221; is a racial slur against white people?  And I thought all of the uproar about &#8220;nappy headed hoes&#8221; was ridiculous&hellip;<br>

					<p>When I saw the headline for this story, I assumed that the Muslims were grousing again.  As for Hispanics vs. pork chop, I had no idea.  How nice to receive more education on hyper-sensitivity.</p>
<p>And I could not let this one get away:  &ldquo;If it offended a few, it&rsquo;s a few too many.&rdquo;  In this era of cultural Marxism, that statement should be used to replace &#8216;E Pluribus Unum&rsquo;.</p>

					<p>Would someone here please post an explanation of the link between hispanics and the term &#8220;pork chop&#8221;.<br>
The only term I&rsquo;ve heard on the job used specifcally by hispanics is &#8220;leche&#8221;, insinuating milking the task at hand and meant as a humorous jab not a malicious insult.<br><br>
&#8220;Pork chop&#8221; and &#8220;graveytrain&#8221; are used by all others in the same context.<br><br>
The complaint says more about Mr.Lopez than he may have intended.<br><br>

					<p>Am I missing something?  How is Pork Chop associated with Latinos?  Is the meat market going to have to change the packages that say Pork Chops?  Isn&rsquo;t it time to stop stupid?  This comes after Santas&rsquo; cant say Ho Ho Ho because some black woman might be offended? What?  Is stupid taking over the planet?  Is Ho ebonic for Whore?  Are we all missing something? Will country folk have to quit having &#8220;Ho-downs&#8221;?  Will Ace Hardware have to change the name of the hoe because it sounds like ho?  Are we all going to have to give into the stupid crowd?  I got news for them, Santa says HO HO HO and Pork Chop is a nick name of Pigs.  Grow the freck up!</p>

<p>I suggest that hispanics, blacks and muslims get together and submit a master list of words that they deem are acceptable for whites to speak so that white liberals aren&rsquo;t blindsided by uttering a word they didn&rsquo;t know was offensive to their beloved minorities.  The rest of us can carry a vomit bag at all times so that when we hear about the latest and greatest unprecedented verbal offence we will be prepared to deal with our inevitable autonomic reaction&hellip;</p>

					<p>I grew up in Bethlehem.  In the 50&rsquo;s, a liberal mayor invited any Puerto Rican that wanted to come, as one of the first targeted diversity programs in the State and nation.  Puerto Ricans only need apply.  They tended to lodge on the South Side of town.  It became unsafe to go on the south side anymore.  Knifings, rapes, murders, robbery and burglary became rampant.  Puerto Ricans were given &#8220;preference&#8221; for jobs at the steelworks.  Hence, the resentment of steelworkers, and the appellation of &#8220;pork chop&#8221; to descripe &#8216;ricans.  That&rsquo;s what it comes from.  Pig Iron is of course a major product of steelworks, so it makes sense some form of porker would be chosen as the mascot.  Why it has hair, is beyond me, but the name was not meant to be derogatory to hispanics&hellip;.bethlehem steel doesn&rsquo;t even exist anymore.  The folks who populated that town and knew of the appellation have died, retired, or moved away.  The town used to be Germanic and European predominantly in culture.  It&rsquo;s now hispanic.  They&rsquo;ve taken over.  Essentially, nobody exists anymore in that town who remembers what started the latin flood, and what bad connotation the words &#8220;pork chop&#8221; had.  Only this one guy, apparently, but in our culture today, <span class="caps">ONE </span>guy claiming offense trumps all other reasonable arguments and agendas.  Those of us who were sick of the imposed &#8220;diversity&#8221; back then, and the rise in crime due to it, used to say we should send all the blacks back to Africa with a Puerto Rican under each arm.  Never happened.  should have.  Then folks born too late to know the history of the problems, and the sources, could innocently call a pig &#8220;pork chop&#8221; with no backlash. And there&rsquo;d have been much less crime in Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton.  As there was before misguided idiots began cultural diversity and recruiting by color back in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.</p>

					<p>Based on only the headline, other posters thought it was Muslims making the complaint. My assumption was the Portuguese   &mdash;   based on hearing somebody call them that exactly <span class="caps">ONCE, </span>approximately <span class="caps">THREE DECADES </span>ago. </p>
<p>But I should have known better. Unlike blacks, muslims, and hispanics, the Portuguese-Americans <span class="caps">AREN&rsquo;T </span>chronic whiners. So this latest &#8220;controversy&#8221; instead involves the hispanics. Actually, just <span class="caps">ONE </span>hispanic:</p>
<p>&#8220;Guillermo Lopez, vice president of the Latino Leadership Alliance, said he was called &ldquo;pork chop&rdquo; when he worked at Bethlehem Steel decades ago.&#8221; </p>
<p>Senor Lopez, I&rsquo;m betting, was also called &#8220;pork chop&#8221; exactly <span class="caps">ONCE </span>(if at all). This was, by his own admission, <span class="caps">DECADES </span>ago. </p>
<p>But these days, that&rsquo;s all it takes, in&rsquo;t it? Just <span class="caps">ONE </span>nonwhite, complaining about <span class="caps">ONE </span>insult (real, perceived, or entirely fictitious), from <span class="caps">SEVERAL DECADES AGO </span>  &mdash;   and suddenly the AP is sending this &#8220;news story&#8221; worldwide as yet another example of &#8220;white skin privilege,&#8221; &#8220;America&rsquo;s shameful legacy of racism,&#8221; &#8220;proof that Jim Crow is alive and well,&#8221; etc, etc. </p>

					<p>Apart from the obvious name for a cut of meat, I, as a child, only knew the term &#8216;pork chop&rsquo; to refer to a full &#8216;tash and sideburns, although I never could figure out why this was so named. I don&rsquo;t know any mexicans so cannot comment on why they feel insulted. My Wife is fluent in Spanish and is puzzled by this supposed slight. &#8216;Jerk&rsquo; refers to dry cured spicy beef or game fillets in <span class="caps">RSA, </span>named Biltong, which I love and have made at home. &#8216;Jerk&rsquo; is also used to describe &#8216;jump in the mouth&rsquo; for pork dishes in Jamaica. The English language is rich in adopted and adapted words and obviously is better for it and used internationally. How about a dozen eggs? We don&rsquo;t ask for twelve. English sailors brought back the spanish word for twelve and we have used it ever since. No problem. Pig Iron was so named due to the casting process which produced several ingots off a central stem, looked like a sow feeding her young. How about days of the week? These came from Nordic Gods and/or Roman gods. We English really don&rsquo;t mind. Months.. November means &#8216;ninth&rsquo;, December means &#8216;tenth&rsquo; and October means &#8216;eighth&rsquo; so how about September?? But I assume <span class="caps">AMREN</span>ers know full well know what I am trying to post. As for Teddy Bears, the ultimate in ignorance and stupidity. Nuff Said.</p>

					<p>The only way to counter the wave of claims of derogatory terms is to join in with a full-throated uproar about the huge number of hate terms applied to European Americans.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to whine about sensitivity to do it. Our online syllabus lays out a European American theory of slurs that use such slurs as a platform to investigate the pathology of those who slur us.</p>

Well, I am offended by your cowardly kow-towing to an obvious chuckle-head. You need to be fired immediately. I work with a white guy and his nick-name is &#8220;pork chop&#8221; and he doesn&rsquo;t whine about it. Make no mistake, this isn&rsquo;t about being &#8220;offended&#8221;, this is just another power play by a race-hustling,professional grievance group. Now that they have gotten away with this extortion, what&rsquo;s next?</p>

					<p>I thought &#8220;pork chop&#8221; was a term used against Puerto Ricans because of their generally greasy appearance.</p>
<p>When I was working part-time several years ago, a female Hispanic co-worker called me a turkey. I shot back with &#8220;pork chop&#8221;, whereupon, she said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m Cuban, not Puerto Rican&#8221;. </p>

<p>I tell you,  the way things are going,  in a century&rsquo;s time - maybe half that - all the old Hollywood movies that we consider classics will have been banned or destroyed.   Same with lirterature, art, popular music, cartoons,  history books, etc.  All of these reveal another time with unacceptable social attitutdes and language that the rulers will want abolished and forgotten.  Just like they&rsquo;re doing to Huckleberry Finn now.</p>

					<p>What a pathetic reaction to some insignificant crybaby. Perhaps the fans who chose the name for the mascot should refuse to attend the games. Hit the team owners right back with the only thing businessmen really understand: money! I doubt that this team will be financially viable if it depends on the offended demographic. <br>
Kurt Landes is a pandering fool. By his reasoning, all it would take is a &#8220;few offended&#8221; to have the new nickname removed as well.</p>

					<p>Communism empowers the peasant-class and pits it against the middle-class.  The minorities are drunk with this empowerment and use it every chance they get with a zeal approaching delirium.  They are rubbing our faces in it and in doing so they are pushing us over the line.  We must not lose sight of the fact that our worst enemies are those who are doing the empowering.  If anyone has any doubt as to the major inroads communism has made in America just look at where the majority of our consumer goods are manufactured.  These goods used to be manufactured here and enrich American society.  Today American are enriching the government of communist China with every Red Chinese made produce we buy.  This unprecedented situation is called &ldquo;trading with the enemy&rdquo; and is an act of treason&hellip;        </p>
