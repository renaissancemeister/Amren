						<p>The Mexican government reported the results of recent studies on Tuesday showing that 68 percent of Mexicans who migrate or try to migrate to the United States do so without documents and 55 percent of them hire immigrant smugglers.</p>
<p>The report, timed to coincide with the U.N. International Migrants Day, also noted that the Mexican-born population living in the United States increased from about 800,000 in 1970 to more than 11 million in 2006.</p>
<p>The majority of Mexicans now living in the United States &mdash; 6.2 million &mdash; are undocumented, according to the report, which was based on surveys of migrants and information from the government&rsquo;s National Population Council.</p>

			<p>And bear in mind that the figures quoted in this article represent only what a long standing chronic third world oligarchic narco-kleptacracy banana republic government will admit to on the record. That, coupled with the fact that 12% of the Mexican population born in Mexico to date (comprised mostly of sure√±o mestizo/indigeneous hillbillies) doesn&rsquo;t even have a properly recorded birth certificate&hellip;I think you get the picture folks.</p>
<p>These are the people who will be ruling the highways and byways and halls of Congress of these here United States in their &#8220;chirimbola&#8221; bald tire decorated big rigs.</p>

			<p>Evidently Mexico thinks of its citizens living in the US as part of an invasion force that it has sent out to colonize the US; it shows no regret or embarrassment about having such a large number of its citizens as law breakers in a neighboring country. This shows extreme arrogance, but that is consistent with the hispanic character. They think it is just fine to impose several million of their people illegally on a neighbor, particularly when it relieves them of some of their own social problems. Really swell folks!!</p>

			<p>According to that article, the majority of illegals in the U.S. are Mexicans, and vice versa, the majority of Mexicans in the U.S. are illegals. Therefore, the classifiers &#8220;Mexican&#8221; and &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; are mostly synonymous in the U.S.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for illigration and border enforcement authorities to recognize that.<br>

			<p>Dr. D if anything, you have understated Mexico&rsquo;s actions. Along with the millions they are actively opening Mexican embassies in State after State. Beachheads to support the invasion, in other words. They have even admitted that the embassies are created to help the Mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Mexico hides nothing about it!  They know and encourage their people to leave for the US.  That is how the US got Texas, now that is how they will get it back!  Thanks to the gutless white wonders in D.C.  Where is Black Jack Pershing when you need him?</p>

			<p>Notice the often glossed over word: &#8220;undocumented&#8221;. This is one of the keys to the immigration situation. There are, I don&rsquo;t know how many, people who are in line to come to this country. The law abiding individuals know that, if say, they overstay a visa, they are &#8220;documented&#8221; and therefore can be dealt with by the legal system if they violate our laws. Undocumented aliens do not have this problem, they just ignore the law. All these illegals currently live under a de facto amnesty. No one will do anything about them because the news media can always show some poor kid whose parents are being deported and create a sob story. I want to see some news articles about law abiding people who are waiting patiently in other countries while the illegals jump in front of the line. </p>

			<p>In a footnote to the 70% of Mexicans who come here ILLEGALLY, let me relate what I learned last evening:</p>
<p>A neighbor, a couple of blocks away, was having a garage sale. Some household stuff, furniture, used clothing&hellip; the usual stuff. Her husband, who works nights, saw the activity was low (it was Thursday, a week ago) and figured he&rsquo;d take a nap.</p>
<p>An old SUV pulled up; three Mexican men got out. Looked around and one of them suddenly produced a knife, holding it to the lady&rsquo;s throat. One of the others put his finger his lips, warning her not to scream. While the one held the woman at knifepoint, the other two calmly took some of the husband&rsquo;s expensive power tools (not for sale), then they loaded armfuls of clothing as well as some electronics into the SUV. One guy warned the woman in broken English: &#8220;You go police, we come, burn house some night and kill you.&#8221; Then they drove off!</p>
<p>The poor lady was so shaken from having a knife held at her, she couldn&rsquo;t think to write the license number down (probably a stolen vehicle, anyway).  In our local paper (a suburban community near Houston), several Mexicans posing as delivery men, forced their way into a home in a pricier subdivision. Stabbed the lady, then ransacked the home at leisure. The poor homeowner died from the stab wounds she received. Fortunately, the perps were apprehended a couple of days later.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of Mexican crime is much higher than our lying politicians would have us believe. Granted, killings and rapes, do make the news. It&rsquo;s the lesser crimes, like that garage sale robbery, that don&rsquo;t. Also, it&rsquo;s the lesser crimes are are many hundred times more numerous in any city than we&rsquo;re led to believe. THINK ABOUT IT!</p>

			<p>After all, they have have the right to come here.<br>
Recent genetic research confirm the theory that most nativeamericans&rsquo; ancestors came to the Americas via the old Bering Strait land bridge that existed about 20000 years ago. Since they spent many generations crossing North America before reaching what is today Latin America, every indigenous people and every white-indian mestizo has Northamerican ancestors. So they are coming back to their ancestral homeland. <br>
Note this is not the first time migration like this happens. In most recent precolumbian times(13th &amp; 14th centuries) Arawak tribesmen came from South America via the Caribean into today&rsquo;s US Southeast and established. In the southwest, between modern Mexico and the USA, there has been significant native population movements along the centuries until recently. Similar population transfers have happened between what is now Canada and the USA.<br>
In proportional terms the migration situation in the 19th century was bigger and more complex with many more nationalities involved (many if not most of them illiterated and coming from backward areas in the economical sense) and the USA survived and got stronger. The Mexican people has more religious, linguistical, genetical and cultural affinities with the people of the Southwest. If that is not true, why we even have a state called New &#8220;Mexico&#8221;. Spanish is not a foreign language in California, Texas, New Mexico, Florida and other states, it has been spoken there continuously since the 16th, even before there were English speakears there or even in North America as a whole. California, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, Florida are spanish names. Genetic research has found many common recent ancestors between northern mexicans and (norte√±os) and USA southwesterners even in people that have english or german surnames and redneck looks and many of these don&rsquo;t even know about having spaniard and native mexican ancestors.<br>

			<p>Harold, you began with &#8220;After all, they have have the right to come here,&#8221; and then began to build a case for that based on ancestors having passed in previous times through what is now the US. Simply passing through an area and abandoning it does not establish ownership, especially when someone else later comes along, settles an the area, and declares ownership. The later claimant owns the land as is generally understood. In this case, that means that Mexicans have no claim to any part of the US. They agreed to all of  that in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in the 19th century. The fact that some place names are Spanish and that Spanish is spoken by some in parts of the US makes no difference; German is spoken in some places and there are German place names, but there is no German claim to ownership and the same can be said of French. In short, you have no argument.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After all, they have have the right to come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase. There is no such thing as a &#8220;right&#8221; to immigrate to the United States. No non-white nation recognizes such a right. If you doubt this, enter Mexico or any mestizo nation illegally and, when you&rsquo;re caught, explain your &#8220;rights&#8221; to the authorities. </p>
<p>In what is supposed to be a representative democracy (or a republic), matters such as immigration are settled by elected officials acting in accord with the wishes of their constituents. The sooner universalist blather about &#8220;rights&#8221; is jettisoned, the better off we&rsquo;ll be.</p>

			<p>Dr. D, my previous argument was neither about land ownership by nation states that existed previously in later USA&rsquo;s territory(Cahokia, Spain, England, France, Netherlands, Mexico, Russia, the Texas Republic, the Confederated States) nor by individuals who have hispanic and/or indigenous ancestors inhabiting previously (maybe during  hundreds or thousands of years)in that land. I don&rsquo;t even atempt to unrecognize the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, even when it was negotiated at the point of a gun. I do not dispute the notion that the Southwest belongs to  the USA. I am fully convinced of that idea. <br>
It was about the right of the people to come back at will to the land of his forefathers and live peacefully there among the existing population. In any case the ownership of any piece of land by them should come only by legitimate purchasing from its owner. </p>
<p>P.S. I also favors the reverse idea that any americans who want to live in Mexico or Canada should be allowed to do so (also anywhere else they please to choose in the world).</p>

			<p>Harold, excuse me, but Spanish IS a foreign language to most people in the states that you mentioned. It may not have been two hundred years ago, but since then to MOST PEOPLE it was and is. Now I won&rsquo;t argue with you that very soon now you will be right, it won&rsquo;t be a foreign language.  </p>

			<p><i>Recent genetic research confirm the theory that most nativeamericans&rsquo; ancestors came to the Americas via the old Bering Strait land bridge that existed about 20000 years ago</i></p>
<p>That is not true. According to recent results (I believe they were reported at AmRen.com some two years ago), they came about 9,000 to 10,000 years ago when the North American glacier recessed enough to make their 500 years passage along the West Coast possible.</p>
<p>The canard of 20,000 years is completely unsupported by the evidence and has been, most likely, made up in order to dismiss the significance of discovery of what looked like Caucasian skeleton in North America carbon dated 12,000 years ago. That, of course, would invalidate the &#8220;poltically correct&#8221; theory that Indians were here first.<br>

<p> So what if the genetics say they were here 20,000 years ago? Once a town, city or nation is formed,established, recognized and continously inhabited for generations; that&rsquo;s the people that have the right to ownership.<br>
 Mexico has declared war on the United States and is determined to send as many of thier poor people here as possible. When the time is right the Government of Mexico will attack, and with 20- 25 million of thier people here it will be a bloodbath.</p>

			<p>Heck, not only does Mexico encourage the invasion, they often facilitate it. Here in San Diego, on every single day, you can see masses of Mexicans entering the U.S. at the Tijuana crossing using tourist visas, all with absolutely no intention of ever coming back. Kind of funny how people claim to come here to go to Disneyland or whatever, yet cross the border with every single possession they own. The Customs officers know they will never come back but are forbiddden from doing anything about it, on threat of reprimand or termination if they even mention this scam. </p>
<p>In fact, Mexico now goes into the interior towns and villages and asks poor Mexicans if they want to go to the U.S., and then gives them tourist visas and actually drive them in buses up to the border. At the TJ crossing you can see lines and lines of buses from all parts of Mexico, just packed with who cross over then just blend into the local San Diego communities, enrolling thier kids in schools, trying to have even more kids (at U.S. taxpayer expense, of course) just waiting for an amnesty. </p>
<p>San Diego now looks more like a Mexican city than an American one. Half the billboards are in Spanish, gang banger crime, mayhem and grafitti is rampant, everywhere you see cars driving around with Mexico licenses plates and the local cops and politicians do nothing. I guess that&rsquo;s why we now call San Diego, Mexico&rsquo;s Finest City.</p>

			<p>Last American Citizen in CA, are you sure your not describing Lost Angeles? Just kidding. I have no doubt about what your saying despite the fact I haven&rsquo;t been to San Diego for about twenty years. I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the citizens there, however. As I have said and written so many times in the past thirty years, ALL OF IT, every single bit of the problems involving illegal immigration is the fault of the U.S. citizenry. Me and you and the rest of those calling ourselves Americans. We have allowed it to continue, we have voted in the same worthless, bought off politicos year after year. Most of these people should not be in government because they have never nor do they now have the best interests of the citizenry at heart. They would be better off selling Real Estate, used cars, or bilking people out of money some other way. At least they would earn it. Polticians sit in office and deviously break every campaign promise they ever made and do it all with a smile on thier faces. We deserve all of it because of our general complacency and unconcernedness for it all. What else can one really say?</p>
