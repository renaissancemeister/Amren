<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The forum seemed tailor-made for Ted Hayes, the Los Angeles activist for the homeless who has become one of the nation&rsquo;s most visible African Americans raising a ruckus about illegal immigration.</p>
<p>A mostly black crowd had gathered at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Los Angeles for a feisty debate about illegal immigration&rsquo;s effects on the African American community. When Minister Tony Muhammad of the Nation of Islam and others called for black-brown unity, they drew boos and yells of dissent. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Illegal immigration is wrong! They have no business being in this country!&rdquo; shouted one audience member, drawing thunderous applause.</p>
<p>But Hayes was nowhere near the podium. He sat in the church&rsquo;s back pew, silent. He had not been invited to speak. In fact, he had been explicitly rejected because panel organizers felt he lacked legitimacy, according to one of them.</p>
<p>And therein lies a conundrum. As immigration becomes a red-hot issue in the presidential campaign, it is stirring volatile sentiments among a sizable number of blacks who believe illegal immigrants are threatening their jobs, housing, healthcare and educational benefits. But no one has been able to unite them and effectively push for their interests. </p>
<p>Certainly not Hayes. Since last year, the 56-year-old lean and lanky activist has tried to rouse blacks against illegal immigration with fiery appearances on national TV, protest marches, civil disobedience and leadership of Choose Black America, an anti-illegal immigration organization launched and financially supported by the Federation for American Immigration Reform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illegal immigration is the greatest threat to blacks since slavery,&rdquo; Hayes declared at a recent Choose Black America meeting in Inglewood. &ldquo;Immigrants got our jobs, the hospitals, the schools. Black folks can&rsquo;t compete.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So far, Hayes has failed to gain traction. His events go mostly unattended. His organization has managed to recruit only about 50 members nationwide. An Internet appeal to support his crusade netted only about $500, at last count.</p>
<p>A huge misstep, said commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson, was Hayes&rsquo; decision to align himself with the Minuteman Project, an anti-illegal immigration group viewed as extremist by many people, including blacks. Founder Jim Gilchrist, who calls Hayes &ldquo;spectacular,&rdquo; sharply disputes the charge and said Minutemen are patriots of all races who do not engage in violence. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayes, whose father was an Army sergeant and a World War II veteran, said he liked President Bush&rsquo;s muscular Mideast foreign policy and supports the Iraq War. Those positions have not endeared him in the largely Democratic black community. </p>
<p>Then Hayes took up immigration, embraced the Minutemen and got slammed even harder. </p>
<p>Hayes makes no apologies for his positions. He does, however, voice regrets about his confrontational style, which has alienated him from such powerful black leaders as U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and City Councilwoman Jan Perry &mdash; neither of whom chose to publicly comment on him.</p>
<p>Asked to evaluate his effectiveness, Hayes is unflinchingly blunt. &ldquo;Horrible. A failure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a liability to the cause, because I seem to anger more people in power than make them allies.&rdquo; Organizations he began with a flourish, including the Black Elephants Republican group and the anti-illegal immigration Crispus Attucks Brigade, never grew beyond a handful of members.</p>
<p>Choose Black America also has failed to take off &mdash; one reason the Federation for American Immigration Reform has not been entirely thrilled with Hayes&rsquo; leadership.</p>
<p>Hayes&rsquo; penchant for confrontation and civil disobedience is not a tactic the federation would use, said national director Susan Tully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;s the guy to take the organization where it wanted to go,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Hayes said he would likely step down as acting director. </p>
<p>For now, he continues to meet regularly with the dozen or so Choose Black America members in Spencer&rsquo;s Inglewood office. At one recent meeting, initial discussion about immigration-related news quickly turned into tirades about illegal immigrants &mdash; their &ldquo;slave labor&rdquo; wages, their use of housing and healthcare benefits, their appropriation of black civil rights symbols for their cause.</p>
<p>But the outbursts masked personal pain. Elzie Alexander, jobless and homeless, said he has applied for dozens of jobs flipping burgers and cleaning hotels but has been turned down each time because he can&rsquo;t speak Spanish. Spencer said nearby hospitals have had to close, which he blames on too many uninsured illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>For speaking up about their plight, the men say they are grateful to Hayes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood up to the plate when no one else did,&rdquo; Spencer said.<br>

			<p>This is a very sad story, but also a very common story which shows how it never works for Whites working on White protection causes to find common cause with Blacks to work on issues that effect us both. The reality is that all populist Black politics is based on opposing &#8220;Whitey&#8221; - that&rsquo;s us. Those decent Black American that do support our issues like controlling Mestizo, Arab Muslim terrorist immigration have to just support White activists, send in money or do stuff off the books and proclaim to any and all that they hate White people just as much as the other Blacks, they must get street credibility and not ever get linked with working with/for White people.</p>

<p>Black/brown unity is more important to them, because believe they need the affiliation to defeat the white power structure.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just further evidence of their stupidity.  With an even larger Hispanic population they&rsquo;re assuring that eventually they&rsquo;ll be replaced almost everywhere, and the Hispanics will be far harder on them than they perceive the whites to be.</p>
<p>The way things are developing so far, it really looks like there will be a black/brown conflict before the rest of the country enters the fray.</p>

This guy is failing because he isn&rsquo;t offering any benefits to people who take his view. Blacks were at the bottom of society before the illegals came, and they are at the bottom of society after the illegals came. If they put effort into getting rid of the illegals, they will still be at the bottom, and be no better off than if they stayed at home and watched TV.</p>

There may be Blacks against illegal immigration. There may be Asians, Arabs and even Hispanics against illegal immigration, but so what?</p>
<p>America (the civilization-the culture-the society) is a white man&rsquo;s creation from top to bottom. And the struggle to salvage a white man&rsquo;s civilization is one that white men alone must fight&hellip;</p>

			<p>The problem lies in the dichotomy created by black &#8220;leaders&#8221; such as Sharpton, Jackson etc:</p>
<p>There are to types of people:Whites, and non-whites. Ergo, as non-whites aren&rsquo;t &#8220;white&#8221; they should be unified against the white man.</p>
<p>However, this fairytale fallacy is about as useful as the &#8220;blacks vs white&#8221; dichotomy in Africa - once the white &#8220;colonialists&#8221; disappeared, there was no unifying &#8220;threat&#8221; to blacks and so they reverted to tribalistic squabbles (as can be seen in Zimbabwe, Kenya etc).</p>
<p>And, of course, blacks eagerly swallow this nonsense as it gives them whimsical ideas that, when whites become a minority in the U.S., all the &#8220;peoples of colour&#8221; will be united and able to strive for &#8220;an equal future&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, once the &#8220;glue&#8221; holding America together (i.e. the white man) becomes &#8220;diluted&#8221; (i.e. the population is reduced to 50% or below), there&rsquo;s going to be &#8220;more&#8221;, not less, ethnic tension.</p>
<p>Eventually, if the whites survive that long at least, we&rsquo;ll see the &#8220;balkanisation&#8221; of America into:<br>
* A largely-white northern state.<br>
* A largely-black eastern state and<br>
* A largely-Hispanic southern state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; brings ethnic cleansing people!</p>

			<p>It just shows how black &#8220;leaders&#8221; are only focused and can remain only focused on &#8216;getting whitey&rsquo;. Look at how the race-pimps had no trouble drawing 10,000 to go to Jena when they raised the tribal call. But get blacks to attend an anti-illegal alien rally? Forget it. Their Pavlovian anti-White instincts are too deeply ingrained in them. Tom S. is absolutely right. Blacks are an emotional, not a rational people. Even when their best interests are at stake.</p>

			<p>As a black person, illegal immigration is far down on the list for me. I got more important things in life to be concerned about. I didn&rsquo;t create the problem, so why should I be out marching and protesting against it. My general attitude towards illegal immigration is one of indifference. I don&rsquo;t see illegal immigration making my life any better or any worse.</p>

			<p>To the black person who posted above. If the white man loses his grip on power in this nation, do you think you will be better off? Look at any place where black rule exists. These governments usually fall into general disorder pretty quickly or go marxist. When that happens, we will all be slaves, and I doubt the hispanics will treat you near as magnanimously as we have the last 40 or so years. There will be no hispanic guilt. This freedom you now enjoy will be gone with the wind. Be careful what you wish for.</p>

<p>The only types that are most likely to hold your view, are brainwashed moronic politically correct white Marxists and, of course, the majority of nonwhites for reasons described below. </p>
<p>No surprises there, then!</p>
<p>Nonwhites are accustomed to residing in primitiveness and squalor since, if we look at their respective ancestral homelands, these conditions still prevail in at least fifty per cent of the territory of each nonwhite race/nation.  One only has to travel a mere couple of kilometers outside any Third World <i>city</i> to find oneself knee-deep in said squalor as any Western tourist can attest.  </p>
<p>In addition, when uncontrolled numbers are let gatecrash white homelands, the first thing they set about doing is forming enclaves which reflect their ancestral homelands exactly as described above and furthermore, they import their primitiveness and matching behavioural traits with them.   In other words, speaking in terms of extremely large assorted numbers of them which is what the West is presently enduring, they contribute nothing but squalor, backwardness and ceaseless anarchy, not forgetting the ongoing intolerable social, environmental and economic pressures that inevitably accompany them.  Their presence in white homelands, is an outright catastrophe all round when all is said and done. </p>
<p>In my judgement, <b>all</b> nonwite races must be repatriated REGARDLESS of how long they have resided in white homelands.  The fact of the matter is, they <b>do not</b> belong in white homelands and never have - they have their own?</p>
<p>I believe also that whites should be assisted by the West to withdraw from places like South Africa and such regions then left to revert to their natural state.   </p>

			<p>I would protest against hoards of illegal Swedes.  I don&rsquo;t care what color people are when they sneak across the border, they are criminals.  ALL Americans should be able to rally against illegal aliens (calling them illegal immigrants is an insult to invited LEGAL immigrants).  </p>
<p>Black folks amaze me with their indifference to this issue since they are largely on the front lines and stand to lose the most to the invasion from mexico.  The illegal aliens and their US champions have very cleverly turned the debate into one of race even though it was the black Americans who actually did the leg work (literally in Montgomery during the bus boycott).  And now the Mexicans come in and claim all the prizes from those efforts.  If I was black I am quite certain I would be outraged except that someone very clever has made it look like rejecting illegal Mexicans is an issue of race.  By demonizing white people in this way the black folks are fooled into thinking that evil whitey is back with a vengeance and gunning for them.  </p>
<p>We all know this is just not true.  If white people wanted to harm black people, there would be a great deal more of them getting hurt.  Everyone seems postured as if it was 1963, but it isn&rsquo;t and most of those issues really have been solved to a greater extent than even MLK could have dreamed.  Nobody thought it would happen overnight, but to deny the progress between white and black Americans is to ignore history and side with those who seek only to drain American wealth.</p>
<p>Black folks are shrinking as a percentage of the population much faster than white folks in America.  No amount of reckless reproduction will solve it either.  The only hope for American black folks is to help their nation, America, drive out the foreign invasion.  Understand that the black folks will come to peril and an end of political importance decades before the invasion extinguishes white political importance.  Can black Americans REALLY afford to be indifferent to illegal aliens invading every day?  </p>
<p>Surely you can see that leaving it all up to the white government isn&rsquo;t working.  Seems like you&rsquo;d suspect white people of bringing them in specifically to depose black America.  Either way it&rsquo;s amazing the black Americans are so willfully getting kicked off their turf.  But then, it really is true what they say about brains and brawn.  I see a lot of brawn and very little brains (William Jefferson, Cynthia McKinney, Michael Vick and Kobe Bryant ring a bell) from black folks these days.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to step up and take charge of your race and your future.  White people aren&rsquo;t going to do it for you.  All we&rsquo;ll do is keep you fed as you shrink out of importance politically and culturally.  Stand tall already, have some REAL pride. And learn that getting ahead isn&rsquo;t about taking advantaage of others.  </p>
<p><br>

<p>PS:  Assuming I&rsquo;m a racist because I&rsquo;m white is pure bigotry on YOUR part, not mine.</p>

<p>OK, that&rsquo;s logical, I suppose.  Only protest against problems of your own making.  And when was the last time you did that?  What was the self-made problem that you objected to?  The &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221;?</p>

You are assuming blacks are just like whites but with different colored skin&hellip;.with the same motivations as whites only toward their own racial interests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even close to being true.  Look at black behavior.  Take a good hard look at it and see the patterns they engage in.  It&rsquo;s all about engaging in violent, near psychotic, moral depravity, to the extent they can get away with it.  Blacks DO NOT CARE about their own family members, let alone members of their own communities and race.  Any time you see blacks seeming to care about these things, it turns out to nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to get away with stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see Rev Al out in full force for the Jena 6, as they dance around on camera, throwing around money foolishly donated to them for their &#8220;legal defense&#8221;.  Yet, the same time this story was out, in New York City, some chucklehead actually burned a cross on a black family&rsquo;s yard, threatening to murder them, yelling the N word left and right.  Not a peep from Rev Al or any other blacks.  I saw one news story on local TV only, and nothing after that, about it.</p>

<p>Considering that blacks were the largest minority group in the USA and able to influence matters politically to some extent, it should be readily apparent how illegal immigration makes your life worse - your power bloc has lost representation and been passed by the Hispanics.  They now have more economic and political clout than you, and every day that they keep flooding over the border your influence will shrink.</p>
<p>No big deal, right?</p>

			<p>What white people really owe black people is allowing them to go back to their natural environment without any stigma or shame. </p>
<p>Once there, they&rsquo;ll dance, breed, hunt, gather, and live happily in polygamous families, free to really be themselves. </p>
<p>The only thing that whites have done wrong is in assuming that blacks function in the same way as whites and thereby deluding blacks into trying to strive after what whites, some middle easterners, and n and s asians achieve naturally with varying degrees of effort. </p>
<p>This white error has caused blacks to murder each other and other races due to their frustration and inability to adjust and thrive in the Western world. </p>
<p>They are lost not because they were taken as slaves but given equal freedoms that they are not equipped to handle.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The only hope for American black folks is to help their nation, America, drive out the foreign invasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope for blacks?  I mean after they&rsquo;ve declared war against whites and pursue their disgusting hatred with a vengeance?</p>
<p>I think you would find few whites with more than half a brain who want to help them.  We want the illegals and blacks both out, but, given a choice, the vast majority of whites would rather contend with Hispanics than blacks&hellip;&hellip;by a long shot.</p>
<p>Keep in mind:  Whether we get rid of most of the illegals or not, blacks are finished as a minority group here that has a lock on all the freebies, and their numbers are going to take a very heavy hit, with a tremendous percentage of black males going to prison.  They&rsquo;re just not bright enough to make a place for themselves in an advanced society, and affirmative action isn&rsquo;t going to help them in a country that will soon be so over-populated only the competent will survive.  The rest will live in Kenyan-type ghettos.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Blacks are an emotional, not a rational people. Even when their best interests are at stake. Posted by at 11:55 PM on December 31&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny, I was going to say the same thing about white people. If whites acted rationally about whats in their best interest, do you think a site like AMREN would even be necessary? </p>

<p>Thanks for the NYT link.  I hope this article comes up soon in Amren. Then we will be able to ponder statements like this:</p>
<p><i>In several cities across Kenya, gangs went house to house, dragging out people of certain tribes and clubbing them, witnesses said.</i></p>
<p>(It is the text that accompanies one of the photos. Vaguely consistent with your point.)<br>

			<p>If no white people at all, zero cared about the black folks in America would we have so many gimme programs geared toward their needs?  Thinking that the black Americans are even eligible for being kicked out is thinking in pure fantasy.  Black folks have been in america for centuries and aren&rsquo;t going to be simply kicked out as a race, so get over that idea.  The ONLY choice you have to to learn to live with the American population as it trends or wall yourself into a compound.  This is why my only message on this thread was directed at the interests of America as a whole and my confusion about the  attitude American black folks have about the issue.  Plenty of others here seem to have a grasp on that reality.  But the dream of an all-white America is no more likely than the extinction of the white race.  Numbers don&rsquo;t equal quality and quality needs to be the key here.  If black folks don&rsquo;t improve their sense of civic quality and patriotism, then they will get the logical result, marginalization by the invading hoards from Mexico.  Personally I&rsquo;m amazed aat the intense motivation of the invaders.  They will put a business up  shortly after arriving and drive it like it was a family member.  It will be hard to compete  with that kind of motivation on a level playing field.  Factor in the lower wage  scale and the outlook for black folks is pretty grim.  As people lose their own resources they&rsquo;ll start seeking the resources of others.  I&rsquo;d rather not see it happen here anymore.</p>

I second the thanks.    Those are extradordinary photos and I hope everyone takes a look at them.  It is a revealing glimpse at what awaits anyone in a black-ruled country.</p>
<p>And  just look at those squalid scenes in the background.   To think that Kenya was conceived in the early 20th century by the British as a sort of elegant colony, an exclusive preserve for the upper classes and aristocrats   &mdash;    practically a resort!  That&rsquo;s what it was!  Look at the wretched hell it has become now!!!  That&rsquo;s what half a century of black rule will do.  And this is considered one of the most prosperous and best ruled of the black countries.</p>
<p>And also   &mdash;  - here&rsquo;s another thing to ponder.  Those rioting, murdering blacks are Obama&rsquo;s own people: Luos, just one generation removed from him.  Makes you think.</p>

			<p>To The Editors and Readers:</p>
<p>    All this insanity of Third World immigrants invading and overrunning the White countries was warned about long ago by people like Judge Madison Grant,Dr. Lothrop Stoddard, Sir Francis Galton, Baron Jacques deGobineau, Senator Theordore Bilbo and others in the 19th and first half of the 2oth centuries. In those days of course you had white loyalists in charge of every White nation instead of the globalists and race and nation traitors you have now. Immigrations laws in every Western nation were &#8220;White only&#8221; and tariffs were high to prevent the Western economies from being wrecked by importing cheap coolie made junk from the Orient. These twin protections were thrown out by the subversives begiinning in the 1960s and now we see the ruinous results today. We have a narrowing window of opportunity, ten years at most, in North America and Europe to end Third World illegal immigration, reduce legal immigration to a trickle and get our countries re-industrialized or we will become backwater &#8220;banana republics&#8221; in constant social turmoil, economic decline, moral decay and political gridlock within a generation. People better wake up and wake up really fast and take action and clean out the rats&rsquo; nest of whores, liars, traitors and thieves in Washington and Europe of all worthless political parties before it is too late and Western civilization is destroyed. &#8220;Ask not for whom the bell tolls  &mdash;  it tolls for thee.&#8221; Otherwise the White race is doomed. These just cold, hard, inescapable facts!</p>
