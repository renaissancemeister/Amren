						<p>In a murderous quest aimed at &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; their turf of snitches and rival gangsters, members of one of Los Angeles County&rsquo;s most vicious Latino gangs sometimes killed people just because of their race, an investigation found.</p>
<p>There were even instances in which Florencia 13 leaders ordered killings of black gangsters and then, when the intended victim couldn&rsquo;t be located, said &ldquo;Well, shoot any black you see,&rdquo; Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In certain cases some murders were just purely motivated on killing a black person,&rdquo; Baca said.</p>
<p>Authorities say there were 20 murders among more than 80 shootings documented during the gang&rsquo;s rampage in the hardscrabble Florence-Firestone neighborhood, exceptional even in an area where gang violence has been commonplace for decades. They don&rsquo;t specify the time frame or how many of the killings were racial.</p>
<p>Los Angeles has struggled with gang violence for years, especially during the wars in the late 1980s and early &lsquo;90s between the Crips and the Bloods &mdash; both black gangs. Latino gangs have gained influence since then as the Hispanic population surged.</p>
<p>Evidence of Florencia 13, or F13, is easy to find in Florence-Firestone. Arrows spray-painted on the wall of a liquor store mark the gang&rsquo;s boundary and graffiti warns rivals to steer clear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>F13 isn&rsquo;t the only Latino gang linked to racial killings. Last year, four members of The Avenues, a gang from the Highland Park area east of downtown Los Angeles, were convicted of hate crimes for killing a black man in what prosecutors called a campaign to drive blacks from that neighborhood.</p>
<p>And last January, authorities announced a crackdown on the 204th Street gang following the killing of a 14-year-old black girl.</p>
<p>The violence goes both ways, said Adam Torres, a Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department gang detective whose beat includes Florence-Firestone.</p>
<p>During a recent patrol on the east side of the neighborhood, he pointed to a cinderblock wall peppered with bullet holes. Torres said the Crips still control that area and any Hispanic there is at risk of being shot.</p>

Its hardly surprising that the outcome of  multicultural diversity as reported in this article had the effect that it did. Non &#8220;Black&#8221; Hispanics do not like &#8220;Blacks&#8221; living in their neighborhoods any more than White people do.</p>
<p>What would be surprising would be for the &#8220;news&#8221; to begin reporting and showing concern for the White people who are being killed by &#8220;Blacks&#8221; just because they are White.</p>

			<p>Lol&hellip;..this is happening all over the US in a very vigorous fashion, the cops just aren&rsquo;t reporting it as such.  A curious rise of hispanic on black and black on hispanic murder and assault.  The two groups are engaged in de facto race war.  In other words, the race war has already started.  Both blacks and hispanics look at it as such.  Only whites are in denial about the killing, both in scope and motivation.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;members of one of Los Angeles County&rsquo;s most vicious Latino gangs sometimes killed people just because of their race, an investigation found&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lest you think it&rsquo;s just blacks they&rsquo;re hunting, this is from Conn., about MS-13, a vicious, metastic, race-based, &#8216;home-grown&rsquo; gang which began in Los Angeles due to that city&rsquo;s sanctuary policy, unfettered illegal immigration and Special Order 40&hellip;and coming soon to an area near you.</p>
<p>From the article: &#8220;&#8216;MS-13&rsquo; Vandals Deface Vietnam Memorial&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221;..Vandals claiming a relationship to the violent Hispanic street gang MS-13 defaced a Vietnam War memorial in Connecticut with graffiti, angering local veterans. </p>
<p>&#8216;Kill whites MS 13&rsquo; were among the threatening words spray-painted on the Vietnam War Memorial at Long Wharf, Conn., reported WTNH-TV in New Haven. </p>
<p>The El Salvador-based MS-13 operates in 44 U.S. states, according to the FBI&hellip;as early as 1995 the gang reportedly was meeting with representatives of al-Qaida and smuggling operatives into the United States from Mexico&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>The paper is wrong:  MS-13 is based in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8221;..An attorney prosecuting MS-13 members said the gang follows the &#8216;rape, kill and control&#8221; philosophy,&rsquo; using guns, knives and machetes. The group traffics in drugs, weapons and humans&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The clueless police department had this to say:</p>
<p>&#8221;..New Haven police told WTNH they have not documented any MS-13 activity in the city..&#8221;</p>
<p>Why would no candidate dare bring up this threat?</p>

			<p>This is very good news for the holiday season. This is the beginning of the beginning of the racial wars. It is about time.</p>
<p>The poster above states correctly that BLacks and Mexicans (Hispanic sounds too elegant and classy&hellip;.) are already in their racial war. Especially in the larger urban city. </p>
<p>But, since all non-whites have racial identity and pride, these &#8220;wars and rumours of wars&#8221; have already spread to the non-white populations throughout America. It is just the whites who have no clue.</p>
<p>The Mexican/Black war can only spread since it is immoral, indecent, insane, unnatural and sick to have them in the same city. One will naturally and normally drive out the other. Whites instictively moved out (white flight) and now the Mexicans will, in  a healthy display of tribal solidarity, drive out the Blacks. It can be no other way since it is how God/Evolution/Nature made us.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t pity the blacks:</p>
<p>How many whites have been assaulted/raped/murdered for &#8220;bein&rsquo; a kracka&#8221;?<br>
How many neighbourhoods are &#8220;no-go zones&#8221; for white people?<br>
How many whites have been pushed out of neighbourhoods by growing numbers of blacks, neighbourhoods in which they grew up and lived in?</p>
<p>Vindication has never tasted so sweet! Now THEY can feel what they&rsquo;ve been giving &#8220;dah raciss honkeys&#8221; for the last 40+ years!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s hard to sympathize with blacks when they continue to blame whites for all their problems. Including by saying that Whites are the cause of black/brown tensions, which they repeatedly state. They also expect Whites to magically bring an end to these issues.</p>

			<p>It was important to minimize the amount of criminal element in society.</p>
<p>A small police force and general public respect for law and order worked when there were very very few criminals.</p>
<p>Now that the criminal element has become a significant element of society, the police are no longer effective.</p>
<p>Only a large military force and tactics such as shoot to kill will be able to bring order back to society.</p>
<p>Failure to act soon will result in untold numbers of innocent victims of crime.</p>
<p>Only when politicians start to suffer personal losses will the draconian measures begin.</p>

			<p>The portents regarding a black/mestizo racial conflict in Los Angeles are very alarming indeed.<br>
The situation threatens to turn into a bloodbath, courtesy of decades of an insane immigration policy advocated both by the extreme Marxist left and the extreme Libertarian Right.<br>
  The Cassandra like voice-of-reason warned in vain against this folly, but the warnings were shouted down by the low-brow ideology-driven bigots that captured contol of the US political machine.</p>

<p>Actually, I have heard that the East Coast Hispanics (mostly Afro-Carribean) use &#8220;moreno&#8221; as an anti-black slur.  J-Lo&rsquo;s mother got in trouble in 2006 when she told her daughter that (pph) &#8220;you shouldn&rsquo;t be with that moreno&#8221; (meaning Sean &#8220;P.Diddy&#8221; Combs).</p>

			<p>What is not mentioned in this article is that many Hispanic gang members are illegal.   MS13 is a prime example.  And, from its base in L.A., this gang exports gang members all over the U.S.<br>
However, despite this, L.A. is still a sanctuary city and the police cannot inquire into the immigration status of these people. Reconquista mayor Villaraigosa is on record saying that any policeman who asks about immigration status will be in big trouble.</p>

			<p>I knew some immigrants from Lithuania. There are no blacks in Lithuania, and they knew nothing of them. It was amazing how short the time was that they began to hate the blacks too. They call them &#8220;Yodas&#8221;. They made up their own minds separately.</p>

			<p>Who likes blacks, even blacks don&rsquo;t like black people. It has nothing to do with their skin color or ethnicity. </p>
<p>Many blacks in America are uneducated, untrainable, impulsive, violent, criminal, lazy, low IQ, and the poorest of the poor. And American blacks are considered privileged and &#8216;better&rsquo; than other blacks. </p>
<p>Of course, most reasonable people won&rsquo;t insist that each and every black person is an incorrigible but many are very criminal.</p>
<p>It is only white liberals who dearly love their black &#8216;rebels&rsquo;. They excuse them any behavior, intermarry with them and have their children, and bail them out at every turn. </p>
<p>Puzzling, but most people around the world shun blacks no matter how different the culture. </p>
<p>I met some people by mistake who thought marrying or breeding with black sub-saharan africans was the cool and hip thing to do. Many people gave them extra kudos for being so daring?? I&rsquo;d be insulted if I was a black person. They see them as party prizes but I just don&rsquo;t know of what??? </p>
<p>Plucking someone out of the villages or the bush and bring them over here? Absolutely insane. They supported and took care of them because their Africans had no idea how to live and work in a Western society. Their kids were very messed up.</p>

<p>Yes, and what if somebody needs a pyramid built, or a space ship that takes periodic flights to the moon, or a great scientist, or a great psychiatrist, or someone who is the epitome of virtue and honor, surrounded by stupid, unscrupulous whites, like the ones Hollywood shows are around in abundance?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all just calm down now and urge these Hispanics to realize what we would lose if they decimate the black ranks.  I mean, the very future of humanity rests on their mighty shoulders.</p>
<p>Just remember what their great black leader, King Tut, once said:  &#8220;What&rsquo;s happenen&rsquo; Bro?&#8221;  </p>
<p>I think he said that right after he invented peanut butter, but I&rsquo;ll have to go my Leonard Pitts collection of great essays to know for sure.<br>

<p>The thing is, for many years now blacks have lived in denial. Many were convinced that more Hispanics would only lead to a black/brown coalition, and the backlash would strictly be felt by whites. I think many blacks have convinced themselves that their only enemy is the white man, especially Americans. Few of them have traveled enough to understand how non-black/non-whites view them. Now that there are more of them in the country these days, they seem to be in a state of shock at the realization, that they aren&rsquo;t as admired and respected by them as they thought. Their answer is to blame whites for teaching these immigrants bigotry. They don&rsquo;t understand their violent reputation is world renowned.</p>

<p>RK: Yes, what you wrote is right on target.  I&rsquo;ve heard the same thing many, many times.  I imagine others here have also, because comments regarding a dislike for blacks is quite common, not only from Hispanics, but every other race in the U.S. as well.</p>
<p>But nothing impresses people so much as to read firsthand someone&rsquo;s personal opinion of the subject, as the below poster, Paulo, does.  I&rsquo;ve posted the below quote before, but I&rsquo;ll do it again, because it&rsquo;s typical and the vast number of readers here haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>Paulo (Responding to a article on anti-white racism): &#8220;This was definitely race related, I can honestly say as a Mexican that there are tensions between us and blacks. As a group I do not like black people but many black people hate other racial groups unless they are trying to take advantage of naive women ( usually fat and ugly ones ) as a non white I can tell you that blacks absolutely hate white people with a passion, so everybody is guilty of racism. The government wants to make it look like only whites are capable of hate but we are all hating each other&hellip;..come to LA sometime if you want to see racism&hellip;&hellip;now that the blacks can no longer afford to play the perpetual victim they want to fight with latinos but they are out numbered and will be put in their place by force if necessary.&#8221;<br>

			<p>you know what&rsquo;s funny? Some guy on another blog called me a bigot (yes, swear to God!) for pointing out the fact that the MS-13 gang spray-pained a monument with the words &#8220;kill whites&#8221;.  </p>

    Tom Tancredo came up with a campaign ad about the dangers of violent gangs, including MS-13. I know it played on his website and was on YouTube but I don&rsquo;t know if it played anywhere on TV before he dropped out the race. Here&rsquo;s a link to the ad:</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s hard to sympathize with blacks when they continue to blame whites for all their problems. Including by saying that Whites are the cause of black/brown tensions, which they repeatedly state. They also expect Whites to magically bring an end to these issues.</p>

			<p>Many Arabs from Iraq and Lebanon, living in Detroit, despise their black neighbors.  Many of the store owners, with businesses in the black community, all understand why &#8220;whites&#8221; dislike &#8220;blacks&#8221;.  The younger Iraqi people refer to themselves as white, but in reality the Iraqi&rsquo;s in Detroit put most blacks to shame. Hindus from India mock the black community and many are moving their stores into white neighborhoods, and leaving the black areas, due to the black-on-black murder rate, and drive-by shootings.  Hindus, from India, refuse to have anything to do with any-one that they consider to be &#8220;too black&#8221; from their country.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s instincts to preserve your race,.. As in the old testament the Hebrew God Forbade the Hebrews from giving their daughters unto the sons of the neighboring races  as well for their sons not to mix  with  the alien daughters&hellip;And to &#8220;drive these people out of this land you are to occupy&#8221; The Mexicans and other Latinos don&rsquo;t need a book however because their native instinct&rsquo;s can tell them to keep Blacks away from their women.  All races by instinct judge  by physiogonomy skin and hair types  behaviour patterns etc..(These things tell allot) these instincts are brainwashed out by (education)which works especially well on people with low self esteem who feel a sense of accomplishment  by saying that they are colorblind and liberal&hellip;I have lived amongst Mexicans  and can say they had a more introspective humble nature than Blacks and where Blacks ever boast of black pride  then do all they can to get white women&hellip; The Hispanics  for the most part   quietly go with their own,  minus all the noisy verbage and physical gyrations so common with Blacks. The drug trade however I have no respect for regardless of who buys or sells  it&rsquo;s POISON   but then huge amounts of Hollywood entertainment is actually subtle propoganda encouraging mischegination and other decedant behaviour  also POISON </p>

<p>You are absolutely right; if you follow the trail long enough you will find that it is the white elites who engineered this. As for<br>
Villaraigosa of L.A., he is only a figurehead - he doesn&rsquo;t make policy, he only carries out the orders of the higher-ups. How do you think he got elected?</p>

			<p><b>&#8220;How many whites have been pushed out of neighbourhoods by growing numbers of blacks, neighbourhoods in which they grew up and lived in?</b></p>
<p>I agree. That was ethnic cleansing, happily approved of by the State and the Liberal media.</p>
<p><b>Vindication has never tasted so sweet! Now THEY can feel what they&rsquo;ve been giving &ldquo;dah raciss honkeys&rdquo; for the last 40+ years!&#8221;-Posted by Obscuratus at 10:30 PM on December 31</b> </p>
<p>Yes, but remember as blacks are being pushed out of their neighborhoods, where do you think they are fleeing to??<br>
That&rsquo;s right, the areas of least resistance, your neighborhood and my neighborhood. And the ethnic cleansing of whites starts all over again.</p>
<p>Already in my once (Metro-Detroit) totally white rural-country-suburb, blacks are moving in at a record rate, and making their presents known with black gang graffiti. The liberal town paper here denies that this is a threat, and calls it &#8220;Creative &#8216;youths&rsquo; expressing themselves&#8221; through &#8216;Street Art&rsquo; and &#8216;Colorful Symbols&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There is also the typical rise in violent and non violent crime every week in the paper&rsquo;s crime blotter. Which incidentally stopped mentioning the race of the arrested  perps for crimes in our city, about two years ago, in hopes that we stay ignorant of the &#8220;Joys of Diversity&#8221; that are moving in. Exactly like what I saw in Detroit as it started the change over in the early/mid 1960&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s like reliving the nightmare I experienced once before, many years ago. And I&rsquo;m sick about it. So I&rsquo;m afraid any vindication will be very short lived. <br>

			<p>A curious rise of hispanic on black and black on hispanic murder and assault. The two groups are engaged in de facto race war. In other words, the race war has already started. Both blacks and hispanics look at it as such. Only whites are in denial about the killing, both in scope and motivation.</p>
<p>Posted by at 7:50 PM on December 31 </p>
<p>Nope, we are not in denial at all; many of us are just trying to stay out of the way.  It&rsquo;s even affecting the economy; eating out is NOT cheaper than before, especially when getting sick is always a possibility.  Forget shopping at the mall and especially forget window shopping.  I don&rsquo;t go to the mall unless I know exactly what I want, and I don&rsquo;t stay long.</p>

			<p>In reponse to the above posting by Flying Tiger &#8220;When the social engineers created diversity, I wonder if they imagined this would happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>They not only imagined what would happen - they wanted it all to happen. The social engineers are almost all Marxists. They believe that capitalism, and by extension the US, is responsible for all the evil in the world. Their sole purpose is the destruction of capitalism, and again - by extension - the United States of America.</p>
<p>The Marxists in our universities and government bureaucracies believe that once society collapses they can step in and create their &#8220;Marxist Utopia&#8221;. The destruction of Western society, and the United States, is not due to some accident of history. It is being done by deliberate, methodical design by the Marxist elites, who control our educational, political, and information systems.</p>

<p>Gee whiz, haven&rsquo;t these fine people, &#8220;coming to take jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221; heard about Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s (that name reminds me of a similar term used to denote a donkey)RAINBOW COALITION?</p>
<p>Seriously, maybe the Hispanics are not as stupid as we thought. At least they&rsquo;ve got the right idea going here.</p>
<p>That a real future race war is inevitable is something that stands to reason. You can only pump third-world trash into our country at the rate we&rsquo;ve put up with these last 25 years   &mdash;   without something exploding. That something being the White Americans who have endured with far too much crime, greedy parasitism, casualties and costs of Mexican DUI drivers far too long. Then the Blacks (unless they&rsquo;re too hopelessly stupid) will have to side with their White benefactors to save their own sorry black rear ends.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree.  We whites on this site are the mainstream.  We don&rsquo;t own the white shyster news outlets, but we all talk the same language now everywhere and anytime and we are on mainstream TV and radio.  </p>
<p>As a white man who has endured decades of having to put up with black on white oppression and the direct and indirect contributions the genocide by white anti-white shysters, I can assure you that I support the hispanics and their fight for civil and human rights and to not be oppressed and/or intimidated by the racist black thugs.   </p>

			<p>I have relatives in San Antonio and go to visit at least twice a year.  Traditionally, the Mexicans live on the west side and the blacks on the  east side.  I was told several times by the Tex-Mexicans, &#8220;don&rsquo;t go to the east side that&rsquo;s where the black people live.&#8221; I wanted to see for myself so I ventured  to the east side (in the day of course). The Tex Mexicans were not lying&hellip; even in the day, the area was a scary  sight.. a third of the houses were in various states of disrepair and many of them were abandoned and boarded up.</p>

			<p>As usual, the leftwing media has a REAL double standard. Why is it silent on the far more common clearly racially motivated black atrocities targeting Hispanics all across this country? Just a few recent examples to give an idea what is actually occurring:<br>
1.) Last summer, three Latinos, including a 12-year old boy, were killed execution-style by black suspects in South Los Angeles: Police said the victims had no gang ties and no known enemies.<br>
2.) A couple months ago, a 17-year old BLACK youth named Jonathan Banks ran up to a little 3 YEAR OLD Hispanic girl, Kaitlyn Avila, and SHOT HER DEAD, POINT-BLANK, FOR NO DAMN REASON, in front of her home in Los Angelos, as she returned with her dad (also shot) from a McDonalds.<br>
3.)In June, seven family members, including four children, were shot in their home by a black intruder. The victims, all Hispanic, were killed &ldquo;execution style,&rdquo; police said. It was the city&rsquo;s [Indianapolis] worst mass killing in 25 years.<br>
4.)In the Tifton Georgia area there were several massacres of Hispanic migrant workers where black gangs were breaking into Hispanic migrant workers&rsquo; trailer houses, raping and slaughtering them with BASEBALL BATS. Similar incidents occurred in other states.<br>
5.) A black sheriff&rsquo;s deputy in Bakersfield California was caught on videotape repeatedly shooting an Hispanic soldier on leave from Iraq COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED!<br>
6.) A black bar bouncer kidnapped an Hispanic girl law school graduate in New York City, tortured, raped, and murdered her.<br>
7.) A black serial rapist-killer called the &ldquo;Baseline&rdquo; killer preyed on Hispanic women in Phoenix Arizona.<br>
8.) An Hispanic tanker truck driver was attacked for no reason by a mob of black youths in Atlanta: His truck overturned as rocks crashed into his windshield. As he tried to crawl out he was viciously beaten by the black youths.<br>
9.) As featured on a recent report on MSNBC: A black gang in Memphis specifically targeted Hispanics. In one incident they came up to a Mexican couple in the parking lot of their apartment. The blacks shot dead the Mexican man right in front of his wife, for no reason. This was a stranger on stranger senseless cold blooded murder.<br>
10.) In Inglewood CA in Januaray 2007, a mob of 15 blacks, while shouting racial slurs, attacked and viciously beat three Hispanic school girls: The three teens were held down by the black boys in the group as three or four girls kicked and punched each of them until they lay bleeding on the ground. The unprovoked attack continued in broad daylight until a passing woman threatened to call police and the assailants scattered.</p>
<p>Interesting note on who&rsquo;s committing most of the interracial crimes against whom, even among gangs in LA: From a recent LA Times article: &#8220;Of homicides, aggravated assaults and robberies committed by black gang members, about 2 in 10 are against Latinos. About 1 in 10 of the crimes committed by Latino gang members are against blacks.&#8221;<br>

<p>AND HERE&rsquo;S ANOTHER THAT JUST OCCURRED TO ADD TO THAT LIST:<br>
(People have NO CONCEPT of the SHEER MAGNITUDE of black racial atrocities against non-blacks occurring on a DAILY basis all across this country and the TRUE EXTENT to which the national media goes to completely censor it.) How many of you know about this absolutely HORRIFIC black on Hispanic HATE crime that JUST happened last month (December) in Lake Wales FL, near Orlando: A black male by the name of Leon Davis (30) kidnapped two Hispanic females at random, Juanita Luciano (23) and Ivonne Bustamante (26 and pregnant), locked them in a room, doused them down with a flammable liquid AND BURNED THEM ALIVE!!! The two Hispanic females are barely clinging to life now. The 6 month old fetus of the pregnant Hispanic female has died. This black male, Leon Davis, has been responsible for a LONG STRING of attacks and robberies upon Hispanics in the area. A week earlier he murdered two Asian Indians working at a gas station in Lake Alfred FL. As always, these racially motivated sadistic black perpetrated HATE crimes are only reported in the local press and in the Spanish language media (that unlike the English language media, does not censor the race of the perpetrators and the victims). </p>
