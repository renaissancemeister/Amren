						<p>The Kwanzaa celebration that spurred a lawsuit took place in the Shelby County Commission chambers Wednesday night as planned.</p>
<p>A Chancery Court judge dismissed a case Wednesday morning to block the Kwanzaa celebration from being held in the county&rsquo;s main administration building at 160 N. Main, ruling that it was not a religious event.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed last Friday by Probate Court Clerk Chris Thomas against Shelby County Government and County Commissioner Henri Brooks, who hosted the celebration.</p>
<p>Thomas said he was not opposed to Kwanzaa, but opposed this celebration on the grounds that other faiths were denied the right to host their own religious events. Religious symbols, such as the Nativity scene, are not allowed on county property.</p>
<p>Chancery Court Judge Walter L. Evans said it would be &ldquo;highly inappropriate for this court to allow one elected official to infringe upon the territory of another elected official in dictating how &hellip; the Shelby County Commission chambers would be used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kwanzaa is a seven-day cultural event honoring black and African heritage. Evans said that based on the evidence presented, &ldquo;it has not been shown to be a religious celebration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancery court room was standing room only Wednesday morning, filled with members of the media, curious spectators and a handful of Kwanzaa supporters dressed in colorful African garb.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Representing Thomas, attorney Anthony Pietrangelo argued that allowing the celebration would be discriminatory, and in violation of the First Amendment, because the county attorney had denied Thomas the right to host a Christian party yet allowed the Kwanzaa event to take place.</p>
<p>He directed the court to a Kwanzaa Web site that described the celebration as a spiritual alternative to Christmas, which also incorporates words like &ldquo;creator&rdquo; and &ldquo;faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By allowing this event, Shelby County would send the message of &ldquo;no to access for Christmas, but yes to access for Kwanzaa,&rdquo; Pietrangelo said.</p>
<p>Attorneys Walter Bailey, representing Brooks, and Leo Bearman Jr., representing Shelby County Government, emphatically denied that Kwanzaa was a religious event.</p>
<p>Bailey said Brooks&rsquo; intention was &ldquo;purely secular and certainly not religious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Added Bearman: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m advised that many people celebrate their own religion and Kwanzaa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brooks, who took the stand in a fire-engine-red suit and gold hoop earrings, said she is a Christian in addition to celebrating Kwanzaa. She&rsquo;s a member of the Greater Imani Church.</p>
<p>Bailey also noted that for the judge to block the Kwanzaa event, Thomas would have to show how this celebration causes injury.</p>
<p>Thomas, in a demure black suit, told the court that physically he would not be injured, but being prevented from celebrating Christmas while others celebrate Kwanzaa &ldquo;does offend me and it injures me &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;As a taxpayer, I&rsquo;m injured because (county government is) using taxpayers&rsquo; money to fund this event after hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because this case dealt specifically with Kwanzaa, she does not believe it sets a precedent about who and for what reasons the commission&rsquo;s chambers could be used.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s pleased that the issue has been put to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can always remember that truth always triumphs over evil,&rdquo; she said.<br>

					<p>&#8220;Kwanzaa is a seven-day cultural event honoring black and African heritage. Evans said that based on the evidence presented, &ldquo;it has not been shown to be a religious celebration.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kwanzaa has absolutely nothing to do with black/african heritage or any basis in religion whatsoever.</p>
<p>This scam was basically invented by Maulana Karenga (real name is Ron Everett), a black nationalist and rather sinister character (currently a professor at Cal State):</p>

<p>Ann Coulter does a fairly decent job of describing what Kwanzaa is really all about (the Symbionese Liberation Army):</p>

					<p>Kwanzaa is already a losing religion - it was formed by an extremely racist black african man.  So its future is like &hellip;&hellip;.  not too good.  Kinda like the Nation of Islam who are viewed not as a religion but as a racist hate group.</p>

					<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>So everything will be taxpayer-subsidized, eventually, except for Christmas. The judge needs to be sent to training, or to laser eye surgery so he won&rsquo;t miss the forest for the trees, again.<br>

					<p>Actually, I have found that the <span class="caps">MSM </span>hype over Kwanzaa has declined over the last several years.  I think this matches similar declining interest in Kwanzaa among blacks themselves.</p>
<p>I have a theory why.</p>
<p>I overheard two black women talking to each other about six or seven years ago, after that year&rsquo;s Christmas.  One said to the other (pph):  &#8220;This Christmas was a horrible Christmas.  I hardly didn&rsquo;t get anything.  Next year, we&rsquo;re switching to Kwanzaa.  Since it&rsquo;s got more days, maybe we&rsquo;ll get more gifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since it probably doesn&rsquo;t work that way, I think blacks have given up on Kwanzaa because there&rsquo;s nothing materially to be gained from it.</p>

					<p>So Kwanzaa is a black cultural festival.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t a White beauty pageant a White cultural festival, celebrating White ethnicity and beauty?</p>
<p>But somehow we can&rsquo;t have those; and we certainly cannot ask black taxpayers to fund the utilities for them.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW,</span> Judge Walter Evans and attorney Bailey are both black.</p>

					<p>They try and make it seem as though it&rsquo;s roots are in really Africa, with it&rsquo;s name, and the Africanesque garb, but it&rsquo;s was created by Black Americans with elements of a harvest celebration, during winters frost no less. It&rsquo;s also funny how corn is supposed to have such great meaning, when it is hardly indigenous to Africa.</p>

<p>&#8220;The double-minded is deceitful in all his ways.&#8221;- Bible</p>
<p>You cannot claim to follow Jesus of Nazareth, and worship another god, even one created in the 1960&rsquo;s as a false ritual, and a non-specific &#8216;faith,&rsquo; merely to give &#8216;stability&rsquo; to a race and culture that have neither.</p>

					<p>I remember several years ago, when my sister&rsquo;s children were younger and in Elementary School, they came home several weeks before the Christmas break with a note that there was going to be a Kwanzaa program at their school and all of the students would be participating.  Of course, at this same school, the students had a Holiday Program but they were not allowed to sing any &#8220;Christmas&#8221; songs.  You know, the ones that actually mention the reason that we celebrate Christmas.  </p>
<p>Well her and my brother-in-law were furious and went to the school the next day and informed the so-called powers that be that their 3 children were <span class="caps">NOT </span>going to be performing in a Kwanzaa program.  That if Christmas Carols weren&rsquo;t allowed, then their children were not participating in a fake holiday.  And my nieces and nephew didn&rsquo;t.  My sister kept them home school during that time.</p>

					<p>This is ridiculous. For most people today Christmas isn&rsquo;t even a religious celebration. Originally it was simply a cultural celebration of northern European people called Yuletide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Christmas is an official national Holiday in the <span class="caps">US.</span> Why is it that it can not be celebrated in any official way but Kwanzaa can be.</p>

					<p>Do blacks really want to be reminded of their african-ness?   As far as I can tell, only when they&rsquo;re decorating their offices.  Zebra stripes here, leopard spots there, a creepy picture of Mandela &hellip;OK, we&rsquo;re done.  Now we&rsquo;re americans again, time for lunch, I&rsquo;m thinking arby&rsquo;s. <br>

<p>I want no part of them.  This is an excellent way to get them to keep moving from us in the opposite direction.  Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll all soon be adherents.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Crossbow&#8221; has got it right. Aside from the frustration of the taxpayer issues(but this is an issue in and of itself)let the Blacks continue to separate and segregate themsleves! They, many of them anyway, simply refuse to assimilate(if indeed they really can)and seem determined to be &#8220;different.&#8221; And indeed they are! We should encourage Kwanzaa&hellip;for <span class="caps">THEM</span>! Whites should do as Gayle&rsquo;s inlaws and refuse to have their children drawn into this Afrocentrism. </p>
<p>The greatest strength the egalitarian engineers have, outside the cowardice and guilt of Whites, is wherever they can show Whites and non-whites &#8220;coming together in glorious harmony&#8221; or some similar illusory nonsense. Let us instead encourage self-separation! We know all this forced &#8220;togetherness&#8221; is a dangerous fraud. Let non-whites do the work for us and separate themselves wherever they can.  </p>

					<p>Today we went to West Oaks Mall, in Houston&rsquo;s western suburb. Had to exchange a Christmas gift or two   &mdash;   bought in the wrong sizes. The wife happened to see a Black female and her daughter   &mdash;   working as a team, <span class="caps">SHOPLIFTING MERCHANDISE</span>! When the Black adult saw my wife watching her   &mdash;   she and her brat beat it in the crowd of shoppers.</p>
<p>I said it before, and repeat it again: Blacks and crime are as inseparable as cold and ice. It has to be in their genetic make-up, the tendency of Blacks to gravitate automatically to crime and/or violence. There simply is no other explanation. </p>
<p>No, you bleeding heart liberal fools&hellip; Blaming the Blacks&rsquo; criminal trait on generations of slavery or discrimination simply is <span class="caps">NOT</span> AN <span class="caps">EXCUSE</span>! Look at the never-ending mess in &#8220;modern&#8221; Africa. Blacks were killing and cannibalizing each other for thousands of years <span class="caps">BEFORE </span>the White explorers started their journeys across the Dark Continent. </p>

					<p>I say we should embrace Kwanzaa.  Let&rsquo;s all participate!  Let&rsquo;s make it a big extravaganza, and celebrate it with festive and traditional golf tournaments, curling matches, square dancing, Osmond family concerts, turkey on white-bread sandwiches (with, of course, mayonaise), and lots and lots of music!  By Perry Como!  And Bing Crosby!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn it into such a white affair that blacks sicken of it and give it up.  Let&rsquo;s ruin it for them, as they&rsquo;ve ruined so many things for us.</p>

					<p> What do you expect from a locale like Memphis where blacks not only predominate numerically, but also run the government. I&rsquo;ve got a little experiment to run-let the Sons of Confederate Veterans  apply to use the Council chamber for a function, and see whether or not they get turned down. As the late Sam Francis once opined, liberal tolerance is Marcusian &#8220;Repressive tolerance&#8221;-&#8220;tolerance for me but not for thee!&#8221;.</p>

					<p>I read the second article in the line for Kwanzaa. Is that pronounced Kwan-zah- ah? <br>
Anyway, there was a reference to David Duke vis a vis his promotion of racial separation. Doesn&rsquo;t it testify to the lack of racism among White Americans today that the only person whose name they can invoke when they need to conjure up a racist is good ol&rsquo; David Duke who was pretty much ignored by most people when he was in what might be liberally described as his &#8220;hay day&#8221; or is that &#8220;hey day? Whatever!!!<br><br>
Duke today is in virutal obscurity except when the other side wants to identify a &#8220;racist&#8221;. They don&rsquo;t even mention Lester Maddox (If y&rsquo;all live to be a hundred, y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t never gonna git a piece o&rsquo; Pickrick Chicken&#8221; or George Wallace and how about George Lincoln Rockwell! I guess it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re all dead. Is Governor Orville Faubus still alive? All the former heavy hitters are gone and all the Left is left with are us <span class="caps">REALISTS.</span></p>
<p>Ironically, there is no shortage of <span class="caps">BLACK </span>racists and hate mongers who seem to call for the killing of Whites with impunity. And they&rsquo;re actually out doing it!! </p>

					<p>The legal meaning here is that anyone can invent a holiday and use the courts to force the public to pay for it.</p>

<p>Great!  I have several ideas for some different holidays.  But first, let&rsquo;s get the gov&rsquo;t to pay for Festivus.  (The holiday for the rest of us.)  I&rsquo;d also like a holiday for my cat.</p>
<p>Seriously though, why are are the schools allowing any participation in this deception, created by a violent ex-felon who was involved in beating and torturing women?  Because that&rsquo;s what Mr. &#8220;Karenga&#8221; really is, don&rsquo;t they know?</p>
