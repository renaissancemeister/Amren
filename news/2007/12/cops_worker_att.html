						<p>Drunk and missing home, construction worker Juan Carlos Franco stripped naked, broke into a house and tried forcing himself onto a young girl so he would be deported back to Guatemala, police say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to an arrest report, the girl was in her parent&rsquo;s bedroom when she heard strange noises. She noticed her bedroom light turn on.</p>
<p>Armed with a pair of scissors, she investigated &mdash; and saw Franco emerge from her bedroom, the report said.</p>
<p>Franco said &#8220;he had been watching her for some time and that it was OK, that he was not going to hurt her,&#8221; according to an arrest report. He &#8220;grabbed his genitals and tried to approach the victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl pushed Franco, 42, and ran out of the home. Franco was arrested in his nearby apartment.</p>
<p>While police walked him to the patrol car, Franco &#8220;spontaneously stated that he did it because he was drinking beers and wants to be deported back to Guatemala.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sorry, Franco! Huh Uh&hellip; No can do!  There is no crime severe enough to warrant our federal lunatics thinking you should go home.</p>

<p>Of course, of course.  That&rsquo;s all true.  And there&rsquo;s a Santa Claus and tooth fairy too, isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>I mean committing a misdemeanor would&rsquo;t have achieved the same thing, eh?</p>

					<p>After about 20 years in prison for attempted rape, I think he should be deported. I would have been so much easier if he would have simply left the simple way.</p>

					<p>I would have shot him.</p>
<p>Standing in my child&rsquo;s bedroom, drunk, naked, with his dork in his hand, not even the cops in the most liberal areas would question what I did.</p>
<p>They can send his remains back to Guatemala.</p>

<p>Illegal aliens are shot on site in Mexico.  That&rsquo;s probably why this guy came up with such a bizarre scheme.  It was simply too dangerous for him to attempt to travel through Mexico, back to Guatemala. </p>

					<p>This idiot reminds me of a statement made by a Mexican man after he assaulted a young female coed jogging on a public trail during the day in Boulder.  He grabbed her after she said &#8220;hello&#8221;, a common greeting among Americans in college towns.  He then shoved his tongue down her throat, she screamed, and escaped.  He told the local (sympathetic) newspaper that he thought they were on a &#8220;date.&#8221; (she says &#8220;hi&#8221;, and they&rsquo;re on a date! He can have her sexually, because that&rsquo;s what you do on a date, even if its on a jogging path in broad daylight)  He was portrayed as the victim, so confused in our culture.  Disgusting. Cross-cultural miscommunication or a sexual assault&hellip;duh.</p>

<p>But the <span class="caps">ACLU, NOW, SPLC, ADL, LARAZA, MALDEF </span>and all the other Ford Foundation front groups would railroad you to prison and bankrupt you with civil damages on behalf of the attempted rapist.</p>
<p>Your 12 year old daughter would end up with her defenseless mother in a housing project being gang banged and pimped out by the poor unfortunate victims of a racist and oppressive society.</p>

<p>&gt;  Yes, this is certainly due to &#8220;some&#8221; cultural differences.  What an awful lot of Americans don&rsquo;t realize is that in Mexico a woman is respected if she is with a child - respected as a &#8220;madonna.&#8221;  Traveling alone, a woman, especially a white woman is a whore looking for business.  I recall while in Mexico in 1986 (my only journey there) I noted the little cartoon books in the stores that always featured white, usually blonde women depicted as victims of beatings and rape - done in a manner meant to be titilating to a sick male.  But we cannot blame Mexican culture altogether.  For decades, white, North American women have been going to Mexico as singles and hunting down Mexican men to have a quickie affair with - after a long study of trashy novels featuring &#8220;Hot Latin Lovers.&#8221;  I knew a woman not long ago who worked at a Club Med in Mexico for a time and her reports of the behavior of young American women there were really depressing to me.  So if an ignorant Mexican goes straight at an American woman as if he has a free passs, yes, he is breaking the law, but his cultural problem is also partially our cultural problem.</p>

					<p>This behavior doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a crime south of the boder. Illegals are just are surprised and disappointed to find that they are not supposed to be here at all. Every account of raids and deportation seem to distress them that we would find anything wrong with people just breaking in, using fraudulent papers, stealing IDs and SS numbers. This is because the come from countries so steeped in crime than nothing seems wrong to them. They act like animals.</p>

					<p>My answer to Whiteplight is the old adage, &#8220;When in Rome, do as Romans do&#8221;, and in this case, Rome is the good old <span class="caps">USA </span>where there are explicit laws governing how good citizens should behave at all times.</p>
<p>No excuses should be made for such people who are just criminals who cannot make it in their own country.  Criminals? If they are illegal aliens, they are automatically criminals.  No arguments, no pity.  I cannot understand why such people have been allowed by the government and legal staff to enter sovereign states.  And the same problem exists in Britain now.</p>
<p>Try emigrating to Cuba (you fool).  You will be kicked out <span class="caps">PDQ </span>unless you have much cash for bribes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately non-whites don&rsquo;t differentiate between white women from various countries. Since there are so many white Russian prostitutes around the world, white girls who travel to Asia and other parts of the world report that men sometimes assume they are Russian and harass them or try to rape them. American white girls&rsquo; behavior doesn&rsquo;t help white women&rsquo;s image either overseas or here in the <span class="caps">US.</span> Look at a recent article about regular college girls posting themselves on Facebook dead drunk while acting stupid and proud of it! This has got to change somehow, how did virtuous white women become &#8220;whores&#8221; of the world? scratch scratch</p>

					<p>How much is a one way plane ticket to Guatemala from Florida?  $225?  $250?</p>
<p>One or two convenience store robberies would have paid for a plane ticket, a much simpler and easier way to go to Guatemala.</p>
<p>And what made him think he would be caught?  If he had not been caught, there would be no referral to <span class="caps">ICE </span>and deportation.  Just think, this poor hispanic victim of an oppressive racist society might have been forced to rape several children before being caught and deported.</p>
