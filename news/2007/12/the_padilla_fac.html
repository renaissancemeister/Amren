<p>A decade ago, Hispanics made up a negligible portion of U.S. converts to Islam every year. Today, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), they make up six percent. That makes Hispanics, and especially recent immigrants from Mexico, the fastest-growing group of converts to Islam.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&rsquo;re not talking large numbers &mdash; yet. But given the extent of Mexican immigration (both legal and illegal) to the United States in recent years, there&rsquo;s a very large pool of immigrants that Muslim groups can target for conversion. And that is precisely what they are doing. CAIR runs Hispanic outreach programs, and its Chicago office supported the &#8220;immigrants-rights&#8221; rallies last year.</p>
<p>Websites such as HispanicMuslim.com and LatinoDawah.org are growing in popularity, and feature both conversion stories and a potted history designed to convince Hispanics that Islam is their ancestral religion. As Aaron Siebert-Llera, himself a Mexican-American convert to Islam and a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at Northwestern University, wrote: &#8220;Research to this point has demonstrated that Latinos who embrace Islam do so in part because of perceived Spanish (or Andalusian) Muslim heritage.&#8221; In targeting Hispanics, Muslims often make explicit connections between what Northwestern University professor Dario Fernandez-Morera has called &#8220;the Andalusian myth&#8221; and the equally powerful Mexican irredentist myth of Aztlan.</p>
<p>There are other factors at work as well, &#8220;including a broader flight from the Catholic Church and the perceived threat to traditional Latino values of family and community in America,&#8221; as Siebert-Llera writes. The Washington Post, Christian Science Monitor, Houston Chronicle, Dallas Morning News, MSNBC, and NPR have all run lengthy stories on this phenomenon over the past year. To a man &mdash; or, rather, we might say to a woman, since 60 percent of the converts are Latinas &mdash; everyone interviewed in each story was a Catholic who explained that Islam provides him or her with something that Catholicism in America does not.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Padilla Factor&#8221; is an element totally ignored in the current immigration debate &mdash; but ignored, perhaps, at our peril.</p>

					<p>The irony of this is that &#8220;reconquista&#8221; used to mean white people taking their territory back from Muslims.  Now it means Hispanics (some of whom are converting to Islam) seizing territory from whites.</p>

					<p>Islam dovetails nicely with the reconquista movement as well as with the Hispanic machismo mentality.  In both cultures women are degraded and looked upon as property.  American Catholicism is weak and getting weaker as it secularizes and promotes &#8220;alternative&#8221; lifestyles.  Catholicism has produced more apostates than any other religion.  People used to become Protestant of Buddhist. Now the threat is Islam.  </p>

<p>Now, I know why Bush has been carrying that Koran in his pocket, preaching to the rest of us about the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;. His precious mexicans are converting. Whaddyaknow, the man and his aspirations for a royal Bush clan in perpetual rule over America may, in fact, be truly far ahead of the rest of us in reading the social and political tea leaves.</p>

<p>Hey, guess what:<br>
Most, if not all, Hispanics, are descended from native Central Americans, such as the Aztecs, who worshipped quite&hellip;&#8221;bloodthirsty&#8221; gods - better get those sacrificial knives ready, Aaron Siebert-Llera!</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t this the same old song with Black Muslims?</p>
<p>I have yet to see a single American black/Hispanic who renounces the &#8220;religion of their enslavers/conquerors/ancestors&#8221; for their &#8220;actual&#8221; animistic, polytheistics roots - unless it&rsquo;s another of those &#8220;Cults of Isis&#8221; &#8220;Egyptians were black&#8221; nonsense.</p>

					<p>If you want this to stop, you have to be willing to be informed as to who is doing what with regard to this issue and vote accordingly (and make sure the guy elected knows <span class="caps">WHY </span>he was elected).  </p>
<p>For President, I feel very strongly that there is only one good candidate this term, and that&rsquo;s Fred Thompson.  Except for Duncan Hunter, he is the only candidate who plans to cut back on legal, as well as illegal immigration.  Ron Paul, unfortunately, is unreliable on this very important issue, which is why I don&rsquo;t like him.  </p>
<p>You can get a very good, issue by issue analysis on the republican candidates here (there is not a single acceptable democrat in that pack of thieves, murderers and traitors).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to point out that one person close to Obama has already died under mysterious and violent circumstances.  I will be overjoyed if they link that murder to Clinton, the day after she gets the nomination.  It would fracture the democratic party and devastate the power base of liberals in this country.</p>

					<p>This article illustrates the strange sort of ignorance we are dealing with these days.  They range from whites who think that Islam in Iberia was a time of peace and flourishing to common Mexicans who think because they have appropriated the title &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and &#8220;Latino&#8221; that they have some realtionship to the actual Spainish people themselves.  Aside from a watered down Spainish and other European culture, they have little to claim as in actual descent as they are largely indigenous tribes that were converted by Catholic priests and given Spainish surnames.</p>
<p>Some facts to note;</p>
<p>From approximately 700 to 1500BCE Muslims dominated the Iberian Pennensula.  Many myths have grown up around that basic fact.  Because Muslims taxed Jews (and Christians) heavily and less often purged Jews, it is said that Muslims and Jews (and Christians) got along well during the Moorish dominance.  The details of that historic period show things a a far different light.  The Moors in Spain were fighting a civil war among themselves most of the time.  El Cid actually was a mercenary who fought alternately for both sides before siding permanently with one - the one least harmful to Christians (and Jews).  There is a lot more to the story of the Moors in Spain, but much more space and time is required.  An unbiased and thorough search will reveal the fuller and less glorious story.</p>
<p>Whites of all political persuations usually buy into the &#8220;Peaceful Moors in Spain&#8221; myth, and it is pressed and perpetuated by Muslims seeking politicial favor in the West and PC historians.  This is because whites have become nearly as ignorant of real history as the people they usually argue against.  Note, the region of Andalusia was named so after the Gothic German Vandal tribe that settled there during Roman times, just as the Visigoths settled wide areas of Spain a little latter in Roman times.  These German tribes mingled with settled Romans, indigenous Iberians, and some few of the left overs from the Cathaginian settlements of Cordoba and Cartajena.  Note that North Africans did have some settlements and did trade in Spain for centuries before the advent of Islam.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who is actually starting these movements to claim or infer blood relationships to actual Spainiards for all Mexicans or take the stretch of imagination to the next level and assume Islamic heritage instead of a Catholic one.  I do know that the reason it is working is because the Mexican people are so poorly educated themselves that they are easily convinced of things like this by various leaders.  Aside from that, people with no known heritage aside from indigenous grubbers are naturally attracted to a richer heritage and wish to associate themselves with it for the sake of their egos.  Then the claims they can pretend to make may almost nearly enough fool enough people to defeat the vigilant few who know this is all a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>However, the implications of a sweeping conversion of Mexicans in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>to Islam should be disburbing to those who have been arguing that the Mexicans are not a threat because they share the same culture (religion).</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of all this my friends.  And I consider many of you as partners in our struggle against the growing oppression and against our homeland by foreign invaders.  </p>
<p>However, the issue of Hispanics as Islam converts is interesting to me.  If the purpose of <span class="caps">CAIR </span>(who may or may not be a racist organization as I haven&rsquo;t studied them closely nor care to) is to try to radicalize non-Americans as themselves in an effort to grow terrorism in this country then I condemn it with a screaming voice.  But is <span class="caps">CAIR </span>like the racist and supremacist Nation of Islam?  That I&rsquo;m not sure.  The black African racist and supremacist Nation of Islam is not a religion but a hate and exterminationist group.  Even the Zebra Murders and probably thousands of other black on non-black (mainly white) murders were directly or indirectly attributed to the hatred preached by the Nation of Islam.  We all know them and their hatred.  But <span class="caps">CAIR </span>may be more of an Arab type Islam.  One can not deny that those Islamic family units are very strong.  And the Arab Islamists are generally very very decent people.  Now I know that some would strap an Atomic bomb and destroy civilization.  But the family centered, decent, anti-pornography, anti-alcohol, hang killers in public squares, and no tolerance for crime type Islamists have a growing appeal in this country.  Let&rsquo;s face it, there is much to Christianity and the agnostic lifestyle that is for lack of a better word &#8220;just plain filthy&#8221;.  </p>
<p>When the Iranian leader was lampooned by the American &#8220;goons&#8221; who yelled at him for his statement that Iran doesn&rsquo;t have homosexuals like the <span class="caps">USA </span>- who can disagree?  </p>
<p>If anyone on this site believes I&rsquo;m fighting Islam because I&rsquo;m pro pornography, pro liquor store on every corner, pro divorce, pro single parent, pro crime, pro filth and that I&rsquo;m going to fight Islam and make them like us - you&rsquo;re crazy.  There is far too much I have in common with Islam.  And these Hispanic converts may also see it as I do.  </p>
<p>Just some food for thought.</p>

Some hispanics are &#8220;black&#8221; and some hispanics are &#8220;white&#8221;.  There is no real separation by country although there most definitely is by socioeconomic class.  The two groups hate eachother so much that a kind of permanent low grade warfare is constantly going on.</p>

					<p>This is really just another symptom of the sickness of multiculturalism. In the end, everyone loses their identity and we all become a tangled, squabbling, volatile mass. The social-marxist engineers know well what they are up to, but the common people of America - of all races and ethnicities - are basically blind to it, caught up in their own identity-politics, rank materialism, religious issues, or what have you.<br>
Strangely enough, people don&rsquo;t make the connection in America becoming more and more &#8220;divided&#8221; as it becomes more and more &#8220;diverse.&#8221; We ignore this reality at our own peril. </p>

You claim &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; (i.e. the south of the United States) because you Hispanics are &#8220;the native peoples of the Americas&#8221; (yet treat the &#8220;pure&#8221; Amerindians quite despicably in Mexico, right?)&hellip;<br><br>
Then claim that, as your ancestors were Spanish and Islam was in Spain you should be Muslim?</p>
<p>As per &#8220;flyingtiger&#8221; - your ancestors loathed the depridations of Islam in Spain - why the hell are you taking up the Islamic banner under the aegis of &#8220;heritage&#8221;?</p>

Most of the time you hear complaints of how Spain decimated their &#8220;culture&#8221; and now they are embracing it. You cant have it both ways. I am 1/4 Spanish with blond hair and green eyes with distant relatives in Spain. Believe me, they do not consider Mexicans or South Americans to be anything then what they are. Indians.</p>

<p>There was a short-lived documentary on the Fox broadcast (not cable) network, hosted by Bill <span class="caps">O&rsquo;R</span>eilly, called &#8220;The Pulse,&#8221; for several months after 9/11 in 2001 and 2002.  One of their first segments was narrated by Geraldo Rivera, (an open-borders fanatic no less), about AQ-types sneaking into the <span class="caps">USA </span>from Mexico, and how Hispanics help that along.  He said that the 9/11 hijackers themselves got a lot of help from Hispanics in other ways.</p>
<p>The stadiums full of Mexicans that yell &#8220;Osama Osama&#8221; also don&rsquo;t portend well for that cause.</p>

<p>I agree.  Hispanics and blacks, whether they convert to Islam or take up shamanistic rituals to worship rocks or alien spacecraft are totally irrelevant to the elites who are orhestrating events in the Western world. Even asians are not a threat, and never will be. All of them are merely tools and weapons against the <span class="caps">REAL </span>danger to the financial and political elites : the white middle class all over the Western world  &mdash;   thats their <span class="caps">REAL </span>target.

					<p>We WN feel attached to our American and European heritage and culture.  Chinese and Japanese feel the same way about their respective homelands.  This is all normal and healthy.  So would cholos and Blacks like to feel good about and take pride in their heritage, but unfortunately, their cultures are inferior, and that inferiority shows quite plainly when they live among us.  They feel shame, and try to boast of Azatlan and the Black origins of Greek culture, pathetic efforts to claim an equality that their own eyes tell them does not exist.  An attempt by Mexicans to claim common heritage with Arabs is simply a more extreme form of this phenomenon, resembling the Hari Krishna cult of the 1970s, that attracted so many deracinated Whites and secular Jews.     </p>

					<p>Speaking about black and mestizo converts to Islam I am mystified.<br>
Islam basically is all about self-discipline - the word &#8216;Islam&rsquo; itself meanns &#8216;submission&rsquo;.<br><br>
A &#8216;good&rsquo; muslim must eschew alcoholic liquor completely, intoxicating drugs of all types completely, must be sexually continent only to his spouse and avoid all forms of immorality and as we know the penalty prescribed for theft is dire, as are the penalties for transgressing any of the moral codes.Strict muslims even prohibit listening to music, playing sports and games of all types (excluding chess for some reason), dancing etc as these activities are seen to be a coimplete waste of time - time which should be spent worshipping and contemplating the hereafter and man&rsquo;s forlorn condition.</p>
<p>Can you honestly believe that the useless, worthless selfish, self-indulgent gang-bangers of LA who whould shoot you dead for a pair of sneakers and take drugs and indulge in promiscuous unnatural sex as normal would people drink cups of coffee would actually be seriously drawn to this religion or actually understand what Islam is all about?</p>

					<p>This kind of thing exemplifies the thinking that I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to escape: (from previously-spotted drive-by poster Taurus689, regarding the 911 Arab trash being assisted with ID documents by &#8220;domestic&#8221; Hispanic trash:)</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiger, </p>
<p>You are right on that point but just for balance let&rsquo;s not forget José Meléndez Pérez who was the the agent who stopped Muhammad al Katani ( Hijacker #20) from entering the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  no way should we let this slide. First, regarding the facts themselves, I&rsquo;ve heard for years that the &#8220;20th hijacker&#8221; was the still-in-custody Zacarias Moussawi.  I&rsquo;ve never heard of the esteemed José Meléndez Pérez, nor of alleged terrorist Muhammad al Katan.</p>
<p>From context, I gather that this Senor Pérez is some &#8216;heroic&rsquo; agent of the US Feds  &mdash;  INS? Border Patrol? <span class="caps">FBI</span>?  &mdash;  whatever  &mdash;  and he&rsquo;s noteworthy for showing up and doing what he&rsquo;s paid to do (paid by me, of course  &mdash;    &mdash;  why am I not impressed?)</p>
<p> I&rsquo;d be the first to admit that it would mean something, if only symbolically, had Senor Pérez actually broken out of the pattern wherein his idiot bosses let in the previous 19 and allowed the entire staggering crime to occur, but it&rsquo;s still too little too late. The crime did occur, and in the big picture, Senor Pérez accomplished nothing, nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>But above and beyond that, there&rsquo;s the perpetual question: how did Senor Pérez get his job? Was he really the best qualified of the applicant pool (and I specifically and emphatically include whites who were discouraged in advance from applying for a position they wanted and deserved) for his job as your and my &#8220;protector&#8221;? What, seriously, are the odds that an Arab terrorist <span class="caps">POS </span>should be confronted and stopped in the US by somebody named Pérez, in a system based on merit? </p>
<p>I say &#8220;negligible&#8221;.  Senor Pérez&rsquo;s involvement was a lucky accident, for him, and his &#8220;contribution&#8221; to this country amounts to zilch. So much for Taurus689&rsquo;s &#8220;balance&#8221;.</p>

<p>To Oops,</p>
<p>No actually Mr. Meléndez (Hispanics costumarily use their mother&rsquo;s maiden name at the end i.e. Pérez)is a US military Vet. When Katani came through the line a red flag went up.  If you read the description of the event, Meléndez stated that there was just something about the guy that wasn&rsquo;t right. He described him as having a military look about him and when he made eye contact there was something about his stare that gave him the chiills. He Katani also carried no luggage and claimed that he was there to meet a friend who had secured him a job here in the <span class="caps">US. </span> It turns out that the &#8220;friend&#8221; was Muhammed Attah.<br>
If some of the other agents had been as alert as Mr. Meléndez vis a vis the other 19, we might have thwarted the bastards&rsquo; plan. Meléndez had him put on a flight back to Dubai.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying any of this as a supporter of illegal Hispanic immigration. <span class="caps">OK, </span>maybe &#8221; balance&#8221; was a poor choice of words given the overwhelming evidence against the supposed benefits of this flood of people. <br>
Also look at the three Hispanic agents who are serving hard time in prison for shooting the drug dealer who is most likely a rapist as well. Bush issued several pardons to a series of people two weeks ago but passed over these three guys. There serving more time that OJ did.</p>
<p>The immigrants are coming in because our leaders are too committed to those who want cheap labor. If you think of it, the situation is analagous to the reason for the importation of slaves here. The plantation owners were too freakin&rsquo; tight to pay Americans to do their work so we are stuck with both the sociopathic segment of the descendents of the slaves and the latest human wave. Perhaps an oversimplification but hey.</p>

					<p><i>&#8220;If your ancestors are from spain, then you are a decendant of someone who defeated the Moslem in a just holy war. To convert to Islam is to disgrace your ancestors. &#8220;</i><br>
Posted by flyingtiger<br><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br><br>
That is true. But history is a very tangled web.  Not everyone who came to the New World from Spain was a Spanish Christian. After the reconquest of Spain in 1492, the Jews were required to leave (or convert) within six months; however the Moslems were treated more leniently and, except the rulers, were not all deported.  Otherwise, whole regions would be depopulated. They were given time to convert. Many did convert but were not sincere and recidivated to Islam. Spain was also engaged in further wars in North Africa and with Turkey.  There ensued a number of Moorish revolts in the South of Spain over the next century and a half before the last one was put down.  The captives were taken into slavery and deported. (What to do with them? They could not be left in Spain.)</p>
<p>This was at the same time when Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela had just been conquered and were being developed as colonies. At first, many of those Moorish captives were sent there to work the plantations and mines. (This was early 1500s.)  However, it was soon found that the tough, surly Moors and Berbers did not make satisfactory slaves. They refused to work. They were dangerous. They rebelled, or ran away into the mountains. That was when it was discovered that blacks from Africa made better, more docile  workers who could be controlled. Most of the Moors ran away, shacked up with a native woman and &#8220;went native.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have personally known Puerto Ricans (I&rsquo;m not saying all!) who are perfect duplicates of any typical Moroccan you could see on the street in Casablanca. You could set them down in the casbah in Tangier and  they would fit right in. Put them in a djellaba or caftan  and they would not raise an eyebrow from anyone.  Surely, these people can look at the incoming Moslem immigrants today and see a family resemblance. After five centuries separation, they still can see themselves.  They know who they are.</p>
<p>The Reconquista in Spain was mounted mainly by the upper classes: the knights and nobles and military people.  Even today, the upper classes in Spain are very European: self-conscious of it, and proud of it. They emphasize their Gothic heritage (Visigothic).  The lower classes, however, remain not so different from the Arabized population that their ancestors were. Even in Mexico and the Caribbean, the upper classes there were comprised of the conquering Spaniards. The defeated Moorish rebels, brought there in chains, did not mingle with the upper class.  They were at the bottom of society and mixed with the Indians and blacks and formed the riffraff.  Hence, people like Padilla &hellip; people who are looking for some roots to cling to.</p>
<p>This little account makes a complicated story very simple. But let me add that there is also the cultural similarity (as well as visual). There is much affinity between &#8220;Hispanic values&#8221; and the Moslem/Arab way of life. Especially as applies to social attitudes and family life. And, as another poster above said so well, there is the Macho culture where they both elevate the male and essentially regard women as property.</p>
<p>In sum, Islamic recruiters have found fertile soil to till in Latin America.  It could prove to be an additional very big problem for us, or our children,  in this 21st century.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br><br>
<span class="caps">PS.</span> After re-reading this, I have to add one further thing:  Curses on any negligent fools who have left the door open!  It was a problem that never had to happen.<br><br>

<p><br>
Yes, I can.  Why?  Because they&rsquo;re not profound enough to be interested in the philosophy behind it or to bother to investigate it deeply.  And they&rsquo;re so ignorant, historically and otherwise, that they can&rsquo;t see the larger picture and how Islam fits in.  True, they don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s all about.  They&rsquo;re primarily  interested in making a statement.  And for them,  this statement is a rejection of  European, Western culture, its values,  and of everything else that goes with it   &mdash;   including the people.  In essence, they&rsquo;re spitting your face and saying, &#8220;So there!&#8221;   </p>
<p>These are the people who in the 50s and 60s would have become Communists when that was considered defiant and daring (and Communism was considered a mortal threat to the country)  not that they had a philosophical commitment  either.   Anything that is in opposition to what you are. It is a contemptuous gesture of rejection.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see them as deeply committed Moslems   &mdash;   most of them, anyway. Maybe some of them, because what they also need so desperately is a sense of discipline and some framework in their lives,  which is what such a rigid religion can give them.  Also,  it gives them something to belive in and something to live for. And lastly, something that gives them a sense of worth, and even of superiority over you.<br>

China is actively wooing Argentina and Chile and has some big development projects going with them. I think probably with others as well, such as Peru. It is working at making friends all over South America, building parks, playgrounds, schools.</p>
<p>When I was in Panama, quite a few years ago, I recall that it seemed like all the shops in the free zone were under Indian ownership. Even then, it seemed  they were taking over the economy.  Indians were everywhere.  I don&rsquo;t mean American Indians, of which Panama  has its own native tribes.  I mean Indians from India.  Panama is a small, sparsely populated country of merely 3 million people and it could easily be swollowed in a gulp by a colossus of over one billion.   Apparently the Panamanians woke up and realized this.  As best I recall, shortly after that there were severe restrictions placed on further Indian immigration and perhaps on their ownership of businesses.</p>
<p>As for China, there was just recently a scandal  (last year) where over a hundred pepople died from polluted Chinese toothpaste.  I don&rsquo;t think the Chinese are too popular in Panama right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK16526.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK16526.htm</a><br>
  <i>Panama pulled thousands of tubes of the toothpaste from stores last week after tests showed they contained high levels of diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in engine coolants.<br><br>
    <br><br>
  In the latest cases, the Dominican Republic has banned the sale of two brands of Chinese toothpaste because they may contain <b>a lethal chemical responsible for mass poisoning deaths in Panama last year. </b><br><br>
     <br><br>
  Nearly 90,000 units of the toothpaste, imported from Panama and sold under the brand names <b>Excel and Mr. Cool,  </b>have been confiscated by authorities in the Caribbean country since late last week, the Dominican health secretary said.    <i>  </i></i></p>

<p>I am re-thinking that comment after having read a post today  from an anonymous poster on another thread.</p>
<p>It seems that the Chinese are busily working on their popularity problem with the application of massive amounts of money   &mdash;    which always talks loudest, especially in a tiny country of three million.  It&rsquo;s having its effect in Panama.</p>

					<p>Thank you Swain for that list. It is certainly worrysome. I have known, of course, about the awful US trade deficit with China, but now I learn that Europe is coping with one too!</p>
<p> <i> &#8220;The EU&rsquo;s trade deficit with China is set to reach €170 billion this year, and European business is losing an estimated €55 million a day because of Chinese red tape, trademark violations and unfair subsidies.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As for the massive Chinese move into Ireland&rsquo;s economy, that little country of only 3 million, could be swalowed  in a gulp - just like Panama could.  Do little countries like Ireland  have any idea of the colossus they are dealing with?  I suspect not.</p>
