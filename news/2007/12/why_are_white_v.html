<p>In its coverage of the Pew report findings, National Public Radio asked whether some blacks were lagging behind because they were choosing not to become &#8220;closer to whites in their values.&#8221; This line of questioning reinforces one of the most persistent myths in America, that white is always right. The myth reflects an enduring double standard based on &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; explanations for social problems. It assumes that &#8220;white&#8221; culture is the gold standard for judging everyone, despite its flaws, including racism.</p>
<p><b>Proof of inferiority?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As segregation took hold, the &#8220;Cosby&#8221; role was played by Booker T. Washington. Counseling blacks to conquer their inferiority, he repudiated civil rights activism in favor of self-help and moral regeneration.</p>
<p>His ideas were echoed by liberal social scientists such as the psychologist G. Stanley Hall, who instructed blacks to &#8220;accept without whining patheticism and corroding self-pity (their) present situation, prejudice and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Hall turned his focus on whites, his research on adolescent psychology directly influenced national efforts to protect them from the ravages of industrial capitalism. Drawing on his work, child-welfare activist Jane Addams established Hull House in Chicago, which saved thousands of white youth from lives of crime, violence and drug abuse attributed to &#8220;modern city conditions.&#8221; But she claimed similar problems in black youth were due to the race&rsquo;s &#8220;belated&#8221; moral development, manifested in poor parenting and a lack of &#8220;social restraint.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pioneering black social scientist W.E.B. Du Bois challenged these racial double standards. But when he tried to argue that pathology knows no color, he was ignored, criticized and dismissed as an angry black man. In 1910 he asked: &#8220;Are we not coming more and more day by day to making the statement, &lsquo;I am white,&rsquo; the one fundamental tenet of our practical morality?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>What are &lsquo;white values&rsquo;?</b></p>
<p>Du Bois&rsquo; warning still goes unheeded. If rap music is so bad, why are white kids its major consumers?</p>
<p>If lower-class &#8220;black&#8221; values are so distinct from those of the rest of America, particularly the &#8220;white values&#8221; supposedly embraced by middle- and upper-class blacks, why do less than a third of white Americans graduate from college? Are legions of whites similarly devaluing higher education? Are they &#8220;acting black&#8221;?</p>
<p>If lower-class black values are so peculiar, why do whites report the same or higher levels of illegal drug use as blacks, as numerous studies show?</p>
<p>What of underperforming white schoolchildren in rural America, the Great Plains, Appalachia or the Deep South? Are they &#8220;acting black&#8221; because they can&rsquo;t compete with their upwardly mobile suburban counterparts?</p>

					<p>As a teenager, I knew a few &#8220;wiggas&#8221;. They were that way because they lived in areas that were heavily black,and they did it as a survival mechanisim.I suspect that their fondest wish was that they could live in an area that didnt have many blacks.</p>

					<p><span class="caps">SOME</span> White teens &#8216;act black&rsquo; because its &#8216;normal&rsquo; teenaga rebellion, just like being a hippie in the &rsquo;60s. And they are pounded with multicultism. But exactly <span class="caps">WHAT </span>whites are &#8216;acting black&rsquo;? Alot of them are natural criminals, just a different social outcast class. Yes, there are poor or even middle income, dumb white people who think its the schools job to educate, not theirs, etc. Republicans tend to focus more on education, democrats on money. That was in MS magazine or something. </p>
<p>The difference is that Whites abhore social violence and social upheaval, and blacks ignore it (are naturally indifferent to it), or celebrate it, as in Rap music. </p>
<p><br>
We dont see blacks dealing with their 70% out of wedlock birthrate for blacks, or dealing with &#8216;no child left behind&rsquo; do we?<br><br>
Liberalsism will have to deal with race reality sooner or later. </p>

<p><br>
<i>What of underperforming white schoolchildren in rural America, the Great Plains, Appalachia or the Deep South? Are they &ldquo;acting black&rdquo; because they can&rsquo;t compete with their upwardly mobile suburban counterparts?</i><p>Does this writer not understand what a &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221; distribution is??  No one, not even &#8220;white supremacists,&#8221; make the claim that <i>all</i> whites have higher intelligence than <i>all</i> blacks.  IQ score distributions merely predict that on average white kids will do better in school than black kids, even controlling for socioeconomic status, and the data does bear this out.<p>However, if these &#8220;underperforming&#8221; white children are so because they are absorbing the contempt for education and learning of their black peers, how does this serve as an encomium for &#8220;black values&#8221;?  Not doing well in school correlates with fewer career choices, lower income levels, greater welfare dependency and alcohol and drug use later in life: how is that a &#8220;good&#8221; thing?<p></p>
<p><i>If lower-class black values are so peculiar, why do whites report the same or higher levels of illegal drug use as blacks, as numerous studies show?</i>Let&rsquo;s leave aside the jaw-dropping assumption that illegal drug use is a &#8220;black value,&#8221; and ask, do whites report the use of the <i>same kinds</i> of illegal drugs as blacks?  I very much doubt it.  And while I am not an advocate of drug use, I would bet that whites&rsquo; use of drugs like marijuana or ecstasy is not as dysfunctional as blacks&rsquo; use of crack or opiates.</p>

					<p>It would do blacks a world of good to all read Booker T Washington&rsquo;s &#8220;Up From Slavery.&#8221; A great book written by a great man (of any color). Of course they won&rsquo;t. Too bad.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that this more to do with the lower expectations of white children in households without books and those whose parents who do not read bedtime tales to their offspring. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. I defy any parent to suggest this is not so.</p>

&#8220;In 1910 he *(W.E.B. Du Bois) asked: &ldquo;Are we not coming more and more day by day to making the statement, &lsquo;I am white,&rsquo; the one fundamental tenet of our practical morality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bois was right, and until the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; defeated American White civilization in the 60&rsquo;s 70&rsquo;s (now euphemistically called a &#8220;great civil rights victory&#8221;), it was generally accepted that the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are not merely White people with dark skin pigmentation. </p>
<p>The problem is, though, that rather than to admit defeat and to  sever ties to the &#8220;Black&#8221; and let him go his way so that he might enjoy the many benefits of his own &#8220;culture&#8221;, the powers that be among the political class tried to convince him that he is no different from White people and that &#8220;everyone is equal&#8221;. </p>
<p>The result has been to create &#8220;Black&#8221; dependency and anti White racial hostility, not only in America, but throughout European nations worldwide. </p>
<p>Unless the &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are set free, there will be no peace because there will be no justice. Let them people go. Need they make it any more plainer?</p>
<p>The question also arises as to why many White youth now act &#8220;Black&#8221;, and the reason is not difficult to determine. After nearly 50 years of the Government and the cowardly political class teaching White people they are no different from &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, it would be surprising if the White kids did <span class="caps">NOT </span>start acting like them. </p>

					<p>White students are forced to be black in most US high schools.  From Pre K-12, white males are tought that they are racist, homophobe, destoyers of the earth, and the cause of all the world&rsquo;s problems.  That is why they try to be black and why the white girls are encouraged to date black boys.  To get mates, the white boys must become cool like the black dude.</p>

<p>No, affirmative action has locked many white students out of higher education, which is in many ways vastly overrated.  Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think of eduacional achievement or the lack thereof when I hear &#8220;acting black&#8221;, I mostly think of the <br>
absurdly high violent crime rate that blacks are responsible for.  </p>

					<p>Hey this is right, if white people are so bad, please, by all means, leave us alone. Do not live by us, do not work with us and do not go to our social events. Since blacks are superior, make your own world. I agree with one very important point, there is too much black culture in white society today and it has had a negative impact. I would be happy to take my chances in a white area, can the average black person say the same about black areas?</p>

					<p>I think it`s just a bad way for White kids with peers  to make a good impression&hellip; Or should I say a good way to make a bad impression?!? On a similar note, I saw a couple of  14 year old wiggers in our upscale neighborhood a while back. I asked them if dressing Black got them girls or something. The &#8220;badder&#8221;  one told me &#8220;It all cool&#8221;  or something which I took to be Kevin Federlinese for yes. I then asked him if girls that like you cause you dress Black are worth having at all. Before I could get his response, my chilhood friend of 45 years dragged me off with a hand over my mouth telling me not to &#8221; get friendly with dangerous ideas&hellip;&#8221;</p>

					<p>Khalil&rsquo;s observation has confirmed the truth of what we all said back in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s: if you force whites to mix with black, the short rise up in blacks will not offset the long fall down by whites.</p>
<p>When has white been wrong and black been right?  Of course white culture is superior.  What can the African culture offer as improvement over European?  Screaming over singing, non-sanitary eating and drinking habits, healing by Juju medicine men, facial and body disfiguration, no number system, no alphabet, no equality under tribal chief law, I&rsquo;m trying to come up with a positive contribution of blacks to America, but I can&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>When the white Jane Adams was running a place for wayward white youth to better themselves, where was black La Jamineete Adams?  I&rsquo;ll tell you where.  She was running a whore house for wayward black youth to satisfy themselves.  </p>
<p>The under performing white students are white kids with under 100 <span class="caps">IQ, </span>that&rsquo;s half the white kids.  Mix these poor creatures in with the blacks and you&rsquo;ve got stupid white boys acting all the more stupid, that is acting like Africans in America.   Tattoos, hair shaved off, Charlie Chaplin clothes with pulled-down pants to reveal underwear, the whole Tarzan movie set moved right into your neighborhood.   </p>
<p>College today is the most over valued purchase a kid can foolishly make.  This is even without all the anti-white anti-male indoctrination his forced to pay for and undergo.  <br>

					<p>White students listen to rap music in attempts to fit in due to peer pressure. That and the media shoves it down our throats that blacks are more &#8220;with it&#8221; and &#8220;cooler&#8221; than the white, nerdy stereotypes. I challenge any white to watch the <span class="caps">BET </span>channel and not find- within five minutes- a black putting down whites, treating them as inferiors. Why is there no white group denouncing this? There is no such thing as &#8220;white values&#8221;. You either hold yourself accountable and respectful in attemtps to be a valuable member of society. Guess which race usually falls into <span class="caps">THAT </span>category. Hint: It&rsquo;s usually <span class="caps">NOT </span>the blacks! I do have a lot of respect for Jane Adams&rsquo;s views, however, it&rsquo;s a shame no one is listening to her in the black community! </p>

<p>They still aren&rsquo;t performing nearly as poorly as blacks and they don&rsquo;t have anything close to the same crime rate either.  So how would the author explain that one?</p>

					<p>Silly Dr. Muhammed.  It&rsquo;s the blacks who demean, intimidate, beat up, and drag down other blacks for &#8220;acting white.&#8221;  <span class="caps">THEY </span>set that standard, not white people.</p>
<p>It was refreshing, however, that he  didn&rsquo;t refer to Booker Washington as an Uncle Tom.</p>
<p>Instead of concerning himself with slacker white kids and hundred-year-old racial philosophies, Dr. M should address the serious homicide rate among young black males.  That is a current, relevant <span class="caps">CRISIS. </span> And those young black males are probably not going to be reading his upcoming book &#8220;The Condemnation of Blackness: Ideas about Race and Crime in the Making of Modern Urban America.&#8221;</p>

<p>This article is so asinine at so many levels that I can&rsquo;t even start to analyze this. No, we don&rsquo;t want your black standard of murder, drug use, low productivity and more which this article actually pointed out as being part of &#8220;black culture&#8221;. Blacks have no advanced culture or standard.</p>
<p>One premise I agree with is the questioning of whether they should try to emulate white behavior and social organization. I and many others believe that the blacks are not capable of being a civilized group of people who can fairly and efficiently run their society. I would like everyone to stop trying to compare blacks and whites, these two divergent races are completely different in their basic wiring. Blacks should find their own way and follow their own path to happiness.<br>

					<p>He makes a pretty good case for race realism, doesn&rsquo;t he? &hellip;Backhandedly. But that&rsquo;s the only way to get the truth out these sorts of people. </p>
<p>Of course, the culture only explanations are nonsense. Even the people who write that propaganda know it&rsquo;s garbage. But they also know that the only alternative left is race realism, which no one but whites (and possibly Asians) would ever accept. And its acceptance would lead, ultimately, (I think) to the end of the free flow of labor across borders. Something that no globalist would wish on his worst enemies.  </p>

					<p>Blacks know &#8220;White values&#8221; are intrinsically better every time blacks move into White neighborhoods, demand their children go to White schools, and insist they be hired by White businesses.</p>
<p>If blacks believed &#8220;black values&#8221; were superior, they would run away from Whites. The fact that blacks are compelled to be around Whites tells you blacks consider Whites superior.</p>
<p>While you don&rsquo;t see White parents demanding their children go to blacks schools you can&rsquo;t even imagine blacks <span class="caps">NOT </span>demanding their children be in the same classrooms as Whites.</p>
<p>While Whites are more than happy to live without blacks, blacks don&rsquo;t find any joy in being round their own and see being accepted by Whites as &#8216;making it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Michael King (aka Martin Luther King JR) knew &#8220;White values&#8221; were superior. He saw no hope for blacks without Whites.</p>

					<p>The only type of music kids will be exposed to via mainstream media is rap and hip-hop. They don&rsquo;t know anything else exists. Introduce kids to white forms of music like rock, punk and metal. Believe me, black culture has no friends at all in heavy metal circles.</p>

					<p><i> Du Bois&rsquo; warning still goes unheeded. If rap music is so bad, why are white kids its major consumers?</i> </p>
<p>My theory is that since &ldquo;racism&rdquo; has been declared the great sin of modern times, some white kids may adopt black culture just to prove they are not &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i> If lower-class &ldquo;black&rdquo; values are so distinct from those of the rest of America, particularly the &ldquo;white values&rdquo; supposedly embraced by middle- and upper-class blacks, why do less than a third of white Americans graduate from college? </i> </p>
<p>And this compares to what percentage of blacks who graduate from college? I&rsquo;ll be darned if I can see his point here.</p>
<p><i> If lower-class black values are so peculiar, why do whites report the same or higher levels of illegal drug use as blacks, as numerous studies show?</i> </p>
<p>I would like to see proof that whites have as high a drug use as blacks. Maybe in terms of absolute numbers, since there are more whites in the country than blacks, but certainly not percentage-wise. How many &ldquo;crack houses&rdquo; or &ldquo;drive-by shootings&rdquo; have you heard of in white areas?</p>
<p><i> What of underperforming white schoolchildren in rural America, the Great Plains, Appalachia or the Deep South? Are they &ldquo;acting black&rdquo; because they can&rsquo;t compete with their upwardly mobile suburban counterparts?</i> </p>
<p>Why does he assume that all or most or even an unusually high number of  white schoolchildren in rural America are underperforming? Poverty in Appalachia is due to the isolation of the region, not because of a lower IQ among the whites there.</p>

<p>Too many kids of all races are going to college.  Its expensive and increasingly irrelevant to economic success.  You may make a little bit more money, but the debts you&rsquo;ll carry for the next few decades aren&rsquo;t worth it.  The ivory tower class is sucking the middle-class family dry while they brainwash them and trash every value their parents tried to teach them.</p>

					<p>There&rsquo;s been much made of the disparity between &#8220;average&#8221; intelligence between Blacks and Whites. Yet that there really IS a difference is truly inarguable. As to baggy pants and physical appearance presented by Afro-American youth&hellip; Case in point:</p>
<p>A young Black walked into our office a couple of months back. Responding to our job ad for an entry-level osition as file clerk/mailroom/messenger/copy machine operator. Wearing baggy pants. He proudly opened his mouth to show off his utterly ridiculous-looking &#8220;grillwork&#8221; so beloved by young Blacks. No, he did <span class="caps">NOT </span>get the job. One look at him was enough to rule him out   &mdash;   that he&rsquo;d probably be little more than an endless problem and potential troublemaker. Nor did his lack of diction and grasp of English language skills do much to dispell the negative image he created. The kid   &mdash;   maybe 20 or 22 simply failed to understand that going to a job interview means you want to look your best, want to make a good first impression!</p>
<p>The bottom line is so many Blacks really are too unintelligent to understand! That what <span class="caps">THEY </span>consider style simply revolts and repells normal human beings   &mdash;   that grillwork, for example. Evocative of Stone-Age tribal life seen in near century-old National Geographic magazines, for example. The average young Black really cannot grasp the concept that non-conformity is emphatically <span class="caps">NOT </span>appreciated by a prospective employer. That perceived attitude, appearance, will make or break them during the interview. Such as dressing as if you belong in a zoo. Ruining your teeth with grillwork, or wearing rings through your nose, lips, etc.   &mdash;   will simply signal the employer that the applicant is likely to be of subnormal intelligence, very likely to be utterly incapable of fitting smoothly into the company, and surely likely to be infinitely more a headache than an asset to the firm.</p>
<p>What IS it with Blacks. That they are so dead-set to shoot themselves in the foot with their attitude and values. That thay can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t understand the average business is simply not interested in humoring them   &mdash;   that they either adopt the same work ethic regarding performance, appearance, punctuality and reliability as Whites   &mdash;   or accept the fact they&rsquo;ll never get anywhere in life. Don&rsquo;t their vaunted &#8220;leaders&#8221; explain the facts of business life to them? Our firm is a law firm. As such, you do have clients visit and they tend to look at your firm with a critical eye when visiting. &#8220;Does the office present a professional appearance? Do the staff look poised, confident? Does every employee, not just attorneys, present a professional demeanor?&#8221; Now picture a scruffy 20-ish kid, slouching around the hallways in sagging, baggy pants, sneakers, etc. Now try to understand why he was <span class="caps">NOT </span>even remotely considered worthy of hire. (Without even hearing his faltering, bumbling communications skills.) Shucks, friends&hellip; You get the idea!<br>

					<p>Being Black means you never have to grow up.  It&rsquo;s just another Peter Pan fest, only with baggy pants.  </p>
<p>But really, there&rsquo;s very little desire to grow up in the modern world; nearly everyone seems to find a comfortable niche in their childhood somewhere, &amp; just stays there.  Go out in public, look at people   &mdash;   even middle-aged folks don&rsquo;t dress like adults, don&rsquo;t act like adults, &amp; really don&rsquo;t want to.  Who can blame the younger ones for wanting to stay young &amp; stupid forever?<br>

					<p>Among other things, several others have beat me to the punch on an issue I have raised here multiple times in the past several years - let&rsquo;s see some tangible evidence of this claim that most rap/hip-hop consumers are White!! None of us can or should deny that a distressing number of White kids do indeed love rap&hellip;but that claim that upward of 75% or more of this music is purchased by Whites, has been around - statically - for a decade now, without change(but perhaps inching upward). That alone is beyond suspicious.</p>
<p>Beside that though, the White fascination with all things urban/ghetto is easily explained to all who will just take a look at what makes teens tick. More than anything, teenagers gravitate toward what is popular, what is cool, hip, etc. This has been in full-effect since at least the 50&rsquo;s and goes back, no doubt well before that in some form.<br>
Young people have been fed a steady diet, almost to the exclusion of all others forms of music - popular or not - by the <span class="caps">MTV </span>and entertainment world. Around the early to mid 1990&rsquo;s <span class="caps">MTV, </span>that bastion of teen-culture, began to orient a staggering amount of program time to all things black/urban/hip-hop, etc. <br><br>
This same baton was taken up in film and on general-television, where this once underground musical style was increasingly groomed as ready-for-primetime, or more accurately ready for mainstream mass-consumption. Since the mid-latter 90&rsquo;s the hip-drum beat has literally and figuratively been pounded mercilessly. None of us here have to ask why that might be. </p>
<p>But the point is this - Whites don&rsquo;t want to be Black, they want to be cool, hip and popular. They want their teen &#8220;rebellion&#8221; and they like that it annoys mom and dad - no mystery here. Young people, White or not, will emulate what is presented to them as popular/cool. That isn&rsquo;t a racial issue at all - it is a pop-culture issue pure and simple. If <span class="caps">MTV </span>and Hollywood, etc.(the engine of pop-culture) suddenly shifted course framatically away from all things &#8220;urban,&#8221; I will guarantee this affection for hip-hop ghetto anything will fade into obscurity in no time flat!  </p>

					<p>I am amazed that no one has criticised the lack of statistics here in Khalid Muhammed&rsquo;s article regarding the college results, whites, Asians and blacks, etc.  One of the favourite tricks the Marxists and Liberal left use is to state statistics without giving any believable factual references that can be checked by the readers.  A lie told often enough is soon believed by the ignorant and those who do not care until it is too late.</p>
<p>I know that when I get in conversation with such people, I quickly move it to the stage where the opposition gives up and says, &#8220;You are just a racist&#8221; when I can and often have proved I am not, bot by speech and my web-site.  You know then you have won, but it is a hollow victory because my main objective is to convert these people to working with the facts so the problems can be solved.  There is no other way.  In a similar manner, when talking with those who are not committed one way or the other, it is important that they leave with thoughts that include my being reasonable and believable to also think about later.</p>
<p>Outright insulting racist talk, often seen in these pages, just gives the opposition ammunition to discredit the writers or speakers.  They love it.</p>
<p>Having lived in Africa for 25 years, one of my favourite questions is, &#8220;What would you call anyone who condemns millions, certainly hundreds of thousands of Africans to abject poverty and much shortened, miserable lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a loaded question which often has the answer, &#8220;I think it is terrible and I would condemn anyone who allows this to happen&#8221;.</p>
<p>To which my reply is, &#8220;So you would then agree that Ian Smith and the whites ruling Rhodesia up until they were betrayed by the world in the 1970s-1980s, and who forecast accurately what would happen if the blacks were allowed to grab power were 100% correct then based on today&rsquo;s facts?&#8221;</p>
<p>Look of surprise on other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the same is going to happen in South Africa where the poor are now much poorer and the rich much richer with serious crime being out of control, and so on?&#8221;</p>
<p>End of his or her, or their, argument. </p>

<p>Oh my. I hardly know how to respond to this!  I do like a lot of 60s rock, but after that I (mercifully) don&rsquo;t know hip from hop. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t I just stand on a ladder and toss metal objects onto the sidewalk to get the same effect as popular white youth music since the sixties?</p>
<p>My mind is open, but I&rsquo;ve got my earplugs in.</p>
<p>Also, contrary to another post above, I can&rsquo;t believe that teenagers would listen to a certain kind of music just to be cool (maybe I&rsquo;m wrong). In my experience, people listen to the music they really do like, and musical tastes are about as personal and mysterious as differences in handwriting.</p>
<p>I love country, blues, and jazz (and I was the only one in my family that liked those genres)  &mdash;  I can&rsquo;t handle classical except for Segovia and Vivaldi, even Mozart is too rambunctious for me.</p>
<p>Civilized, begging your pardon, but I don&rsquo;t think you and I will contribute heroically to upholding white culture in the music department.</p>

<p>1) I have never believed that most rap-listeners are White. Maybe honest purchasers but not listeners. Look at all the illegal, pirated downloaded music blacks use.</p>
<p>2) It could be just a peer pressure thing, the desire to &#8216;fit in&rsquo;. It may also be a defense mechanism if they are in a largely black area.</p>
<p>3) Once these kids grow up and get jobs they will outgrow this nonsense hopefully.</p>

					<p>White values are normal civilized standard for any human being. Europeans and whites are the ones who started social services on a big scale because we were suckered into thinking that blacks/hispanics/middle easterners/indians etc.. are just waiting to be us and could be law abiding, rational, peaceful, and democratic members of society. </p>
<p>Well, apparently not since blacks consider these values to be less than black values such as killing for gang turf, drug dealing, murder and thievery, home invasions, raping children, singing about beating &#8216;hos&rsquo; and &#8216;(w)itches&rsquo; and thuggery, pimp&rsquo;ng as the pinnacle of career attainment, and many many more different &#8220;values&#8221;.</p>

<p>Actually, the baggy, sagging pants fashion was started by quasi-hippy preppy kids (prep school kids who listened to 60s rock and smoked pot) in the southeast in the mid 80s.  I was there and saw it with my own eyes - all the while, blacks were still wearing tight-fitting parachute pants.</p>

<p>I concur 100% When I graduated high school (1990) there was definately a line between the rap listening black kids and the rock/pop listening white kids. My husband and I listen almost exclusively to music written 1989 or earlier since we can hardly stand to listen to what passes as popular music.

<p><br>
To benefit them and the rest of humanity I might add. Instead they&rsquo;ve been lambasted and browbeaten for the last thirty years both at school)believe me I see it every day) and in the media about how Whites in general and White males in particular are evil incarnate and a race to be eliminated. As adolescents in school and later as young adults in college and in the work place, they observe more and more White females throwing themselves at Black males.  They also witness on a daily basis the double standard of behavior expectations vis a vis Blacks.</p>
<p>Remember the young white girl in Oprah&rsquo;s audience during one of her White guilt workshops who tearfully declared how ashamed she was to be White?  OF <span class="caps">COURSE </span>they devalue their European roots!  <br>
They aren&rsquo;t permitted to see the truth that Europeans and their emmigrant descendents in two other continents have contributed more to the betterment of every aspect of life for all mankind than any other race; even if we allow for the misdeeds of some throughout history.</p>

					<p>During colonial times and Apartheid blacks were always compared to teenagers or children. Alber Schweizer made a similar famous comment. That&rsquo;s because they often acted fickle, made rash judgements and needed constant supervision to get the jobs done.</p>
<p>When white kids act that way its just a template for rebellion. Blacks are in a constant state of rebellion against whites. That&rsquo;s why the Afrikaners eventually gave up. The <span class="caps">ANC </span>hordes just kept rebelling incessently, regardless of all the concessions which were made. You just cannot help people who never become reasonable grownups. White kids eventually learn to become grownups. Judging the state of post-colonial Africa, most of these rebellious blacks just perpetually stay in a teenager mode.</p>

					<p>The ancient scriptures of India advise against caste mixing because &#8220;low men do not become high by high associations, but high men become low by low associations.&#8221; </p>
<p>Something to think about.</p>

					<p><i>Around the early to mid 1990&rsquo;s <span class="caps">MTV, </span>that bastion of teen-culture, began to orient a staggering amount of program time to all things black/urban/hip-hop, etc.<br>
</i></p>
<p>Ironic, considering that when <span class="caps">MTV </span>first got started, it was criticized for not giving enough air time to black music.</p>
<p>Anyway, <span class="caps">MTV </span>now also seems to have a positive mania for depicting BM/WF couples.</p>

					<p><i>I can&rsquo;t handle classical except for Segovia and Vivaldi, even Mozart is too rambunctious for me.</i></p>
<p>I generally don&rsquo;t like classical either, but Gymnopedie No.3 and Barber&rsquo;s Adagio for Strings are two pieces that touch my very soul. Other than that, it&rsquo;s classic country and 80s and early 90s metal for me.</p>
