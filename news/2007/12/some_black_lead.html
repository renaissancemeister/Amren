						<p>Consideration of a white retired CEO to lead the new Grady hospital board has angered some black leaders, who say it fuels suspicions that the white business community is trying to take over the hospital.</p>
<p>The name of Pete Correll, former head of Georgia Pacific, has emerged as a possible leader of the new board.</p>
<p>The existing Grady board of trustees voted last month to hand over much of its power to a new independent nonprofit board and is expected within weeks to approve the lease agreement and name new board members.</p>
<p>Some black leaders say the prospect of Correll leading the new board heightens fears that the hospital will sacrifice its 115-year mission of serving the poor and uninsured, many from struggling black communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he believes the business community wants control of Grady&rsquo;s real estate and its millions in contracts and that Correll would not protect the hospital&rsquo;s mission to serve the poor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Grady board has yet to publicly identify candidates for the new nonprofit board, which is expected to have about 15 members and could be operating by March.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new board is expected to choose its own leader, but clearly its composition will heavily influence that decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversy over Correll comes less than a month after the board irked state and county lawmakers and the business community with the demanding tone of its resolution to create a nonprofit operating board. Some serious backpedaling by the board has calmed those tensions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever talks about this as a racial takeover of the hospital is living on another planet,&#8221; [Ben Johnson, managing partner of the law firm Alston &amp; Bird and a chamber task force member] said. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s time people get over this stuff and get ready to solve the problems.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time people get over this stuff and get ready to solve the problems.&rdquo;<br>
   That would be correct Mr. Ben Johnson!  CA has lost several of its hospitals and we here don&rsquo;t want that to happen to Grady.  Grady has the best trauma unit in the state and we don&rsquo;t want it to go under.  Here in Hotlanta we know why Grady is having such a terrible time right now.  Too many &#8220;poor and uninsured&#8221;.  </p>
<p>  &#8220;many from struggling black communities&#8221;</p>
<p>  Lest we forget the huge illegal population working accident prone jobs and &#8220;anchor babies&#8221;.  They drive to Grady from all over the state because they know they will not be turned away and    they will not have to pay.  Helping the &#8220;poor and uninsured&#8221; is nobel but at this point it has become just another free ride&hellip;</p>
<p>  The answers are not very pleasent, but the alternative is the loss of our great hospital.  We can keep Grady&rsquo;s mission in tact but things have to change and tough leaders are needed.  Take a guess what that means!! :-0</p>

					<p>  Get <span class="caps">ALL </span>the Whites out of there, put blacks in control of everything, from the janitors to the head surgeon and all administration, give them <span class="caps">MORE </span>funding than a normal Hospital would recieve. Then go back in 2 years and see the results, that is unless it hasen&rsquo;t been closed 18 months before that revisit do to being a total disaster.  This plan I have just stated would show the problem areas in the Hospital, I can only guess how they would spin this around to making it YTs fault.</p>

					<p>Actually, I like it when blacks behave in this manner. Every time they do something like this, they show their true colors a bit more. Those colors being that they don&rsquo;t care about anything except race. i would think that sometimes when they do this they lose a liberal every so often. some liberals aren&rsquo;t quite as stupid as all the rest.</p>
<p>Another thing. all this constant talk of the &#8220;poor.&#8221; As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, someone who&rsquo;s poor is someone down on their luck through no fault of their own. It happens. People run into difficulties in life. Maybe they become ill or are injured or any number of other mishaps might make them poor. However, I don&rsquo;t put people who are brought up to be &#8220;poor&#8221; in the  category with the people I just mentioned above. People have the obligation to try to live independantly. If they don&rsquo;t try, then it isn&rsquo;t the duty of the taxpayer to bail them out. That&rsquo;s the difference.</p>

					<p> The reason for the big shake-up at Grady is that when managed mainly by blacks lo these many years, it wound up in a shambles and bankrupt. The black poobahs don&rsquo;t want an experienced white businessman in there because it might not be as juicy a political plum for them if put on a sound financial basis as he no doubt would do.<br>
 Speaking of the big black nabobs, is there a so-called black &#8220;leader&#8221; in this country who doesn&rsquo;t have &#8220;the Rev.&#8221; in front of his name?</p>

About 3 or 4 years ago, Sheehan Memorial Hospital here in Buffalo which largely serves the black community, was the victim of black leadership. The president or <span class="caps">CEO </span>skipped town just as the audit was released showing how insolvent the system was.</p>
<p>They hired the head of the Pharmacy (a White guy) to run the place. Within six months, the hospital was financially stable.</p>
<p>After it was saved, the majority black board came out publicly and said &#8216;they&rsquo; were going to hire someone who represented the community. As far as I know, there haven&rsquo;t been any problems since.</p>
<p>It took a black man to nearly destroy the system and a White man to save it. Even so, the black board wasn&rsquo;t the least bit grateful and wanted to put another black in charge as soon as possible.</p>

					<p>He said he believes the business community wants control of Grady&rsquo;s real estate and its millions in contracts and that Correll would not protect the hospital&rsquo;s mission to serve the poor.</p>
<p>Oh sure&hellip;throw in the &#8220;not protect the hospital&rsquo;s mission to serve the poor&#8221; to negate what is really the concern here.  Whitey&rsquo;s just itching to get his hands on that prime real estate and those millions in contracts. The audacity&hellip;!</p>
<p>Without taxpayers funding that and other charitable hospitals and their lucrative contracts (lucrative for somebody I reckon, sure as hell not the taxpayers), we&rsquo;d see the truth emerge about that long tradition of helping the poor. When blacks say &#8220;helping uninsured, indigent blacks,&#8221; they really mean &#8220;tax transfers from (oftentimes uninsured, indigent themselves)mostly Whites to fund those nonexistent charitable inclinations and affirmative action jobs aplenty.    </p>

					<p>I doubt it would be possible to even mention the muddying of waters by blacks attaining jobs in majority white places of business, or in places that deal with a majority of whites.  In fact, <span class="caps">IT&rsquo;S GOOD </span>somehow; yet this doesn&rsquo;t apply.  I&rsquo;m wondering, since I am unfamiliar with Grady  &mdash;  and rightfully so  &mdash;  who built that hospital to begin with?</p>

					<p>I Don&rsquo;t care about their right to have a black dysfunctional hospital in the white southland. We need our fortitude back!</p>
<p>Ben Tillman, US SC Senator, in 1900, declared to US Congress:</p>
<p>&#8220;As to his &#8216;rights&rsquo; &mdash; I will not discuss them now. We of the South have never recognized the right of the {blacks} to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be equal to the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without {punishing} him. I would to God the last one of them was in Africa and that none of them had ever been brought to our shores. But I will not pursue the subject further.&#8221;</p>
<p>But AmRen will&hellip;</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m surprised someone from Alston and Bird(Atlanta&rsquo;s 2nd top law firm)is dismissing cries of &#8220;racism&#8221;, as I thought the firm was liberal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Struggling black communities&#8221; means &#8220;young, unmarried, poor blacks who pop out children they obviously can&rsquo;t afford.&#8221;</p>
<p>My late best friend (white) gave birth to her 2nd child at Grady in 1990. Her mom warned me not to go visit my friend, although the mom did so herself, as Grady is known for being unsafe. I followed the advice.</p>

<i>&#8220;But blacks don&rsquo;t mind taking over our institutions or cities or countries, do they? Such hypocrisy&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The rule is: &#8216;What is historically White must be made black (by any means necessary; either laws, civil disobedience, or violence). What is historically black must remain black (at any cost to the community or public funds)&rsquo;.</p>

					<p>I am an Atlanta surgeon, and I completed my internship and surgery residency at Grady in the 1970s. It was a wonderful training institution at that time with, and since the entire medical staff came from Emory University Medical School, the professors and physicians were all white, except for one affirmative action orthopedic resident, and the nursing staff was racially mixed. A board of white men ran the institution, and it functioned as a large well equipted facility should. The equipment was up to date, and new cutting edge technology (such as CT scanners)was often first installed at Grady before anywhere else in the country. The professors and surgeons were leaders in their respective fields, and the resident staff was hard working and dedicated. <br>
   Shortly after I finished my training, Emory was pushed aside to make room for medical students from the newly formed Morehouse School of Medicine, an all black medical school filled with affirmative action &#8220;doctors&#8221;. That was the beginning of the slippery slope on which Grady now finds itself. Of course, Emory is still represented at Grady since the Morehouse school cannot provide the highly qualified speciaity physicians such as heart surgeons and neurosurgeons. Those specialties are far beyond the abilitiese of Morehouse &#8220;doctors&#8221;.<br><br>
   With the new relevance of Morehouse, and the takeover of the City government by blacks, the Grady board, which is appointed by the local govenrments, became almost exclusively black.        <br><br>
   Remember that Grady is a <span class="caps">FOR PROFIT </span>hospital, and therefore is not subject to the close scrutiny which the <span class="caps">IRS </span>gives to non-profits. In exchange for relief from paying taxes, the <span class="caps">IRS </span>requires that non-profit board members must not act in their own self interest, a requirement which the current board finds most distasteful.<br><br>
   Most of the black board members see Grady as a meal ticket for themselves and their family and friends. Despite almost complete ignorance of medicine and nursing and the health care industry, these board members became instant experts in the delivery of health care and they saw to it that Grady contracted with their sons and daughters who just happened to open private agencies providing such things as home health services which then over charged and overbilled Medicare and Medicaid, and reaped a profit windfall for the family. Current board members talk about concern for the black community is a total fabrication. They are afraid they will lose control of Grady&rsquo;s cash flow from the institution to their pockets.<br><br>
   The blacks are so upset now because the only way the hospital will survive is if it becomes a non-profit and such schemes are prohibited by federal law, and scrutinized by the <span class="caps">IRS.</span> Of course, whenever blacks are involved they will find a new way to steal, regardless of the law.<br><br>
   Grady does have a 115 year history of serving the poor, black and white, but for the last approximately 27 years that mission has been transformed by a &#8220;what&rsquo;s in it for me&#8221; board, with the poor getting what&rsquo;s left over.<br><br>
   Pete Correll and a largely white board running the hospital as a non-profit institution will be the best thing that can happen to Grady. But don&rsquo;t count on it. The blacks will whine and march and protest and scream discrimination until they get what they want, and then Grady&rsquo;s slide down the slippery slope will continue. If Grady is eventually run again by white people, the blacks will scream &#8220;discrimination&#8221;; but if it remains in the hands of blacks it will fail, and we (whites and the white business community) will be blamed because we failed to donate enough money to the institution, and that will be called &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. We can&rsquo;t win either way, but Grady will be the loser.</p>

					<p>This provides quite an interesting insight into the black mindset: instead of being grateful that whites are &#8220;trying to take over&#8221; a hospital, they are <strong>afraid</strong> of it.</p>

<p>Sadly I completely agree with you. This reminds me of what happens over and over again in s. africa and zimbabwe. It was and is still our fault in thinking that they are like us and not leaving them to their way of life. That is the true tragedy of the colonial period. We were neither worse nor better than any other powers but the real crime was in pulling these pre-stone age people into our world and our expectations. We watch them fail again and again. I wish we could help black people to happily and comfortably function in their environment without leaching off of others.</p>

					<p>Best way to put Grady Hospital in it&rsquo;s place is to bring back old Milton County (presently wealthy, White north Fulton) and cut off tax funding for this ghetto boondoggle. Same crew that screams about White devils taking Grady away from them threatened &#8220;blood in the streets&#8221; if Milton was re-born.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to de-fund taxpayer underwriting of ghetto politics nationwide, regardless of the reaction.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately if Grady were to close you would see a dark storm of medical refugees descend on all of the surrounding Metro Atlanta Hospitals (including N. Fulton); by Federal law they have to treat welfare cases.  I think the best solution is to keep them penned up at Grady, as distasteful as that might seem it really is in everyone&rsquo;s best interest.  Imagine if every time you had to go to the hospital you had to deal with Grady refugees&hellip;It would make life for all &#8220;normal&#8221; hospitals in the area unbearable.</p>
<p>The only solution is to start an effective PR offensive that would expose the hypocrisy of the Atlanta civil rights whores for what they are&hellip;utter and complete hypocrites.  If everyone in the country knew that the only reason they didn&rsquo;t want Pete Correll to run the hospital is because he is White then I think there would be a major backlash against them and their power might diminish as a result.<br>
