<h1><a href="/timespic/stories/index-ssf_/base/news-8/1196749361212270.xml">Hate Crime Legislation Up for Vote</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Nolan, Times-Picayune, December 4, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New Orleans City Council appears headed toward the frontier of hate crime legislation with a proposal to make it a crime to intimidate someone with a noose, a swastika, a burning cross or &#8220;any symbol&#8221; deliberately chosen to frighten.</p>
<p>Council President Arnie Fielkow&rsquo;s proposal was roundly praised by a lineup of civil rights and tolerance groups at a Monday morning City Hall hearing. Councilwoman Shelley Midura said the legislation will almost certainly pass unanimously at Thursday&rsquo;s council meeting.</p>
<p>The act refers to &#8220;the crime of intimidation by use of hate symbols.&#8221; It defines the crime as placing a burning cross, a swastika or a noose on another&rsquo;s property, a highway or public place &#8220;with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another section of the ordinance broadens the list of banned symbols beyond those three to include &#8220;any symbol&#8221; deployed on another&rsquo;s property, a highway or public place to intimidate another.</p>
<p>A similar but more limited prohibition already exists in state law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Fielkow&rsquo;s legislation is broader in two ways:</p>
<p>It would make it a crime punishable by a $500 fine and six months in jail to deploy &#8220;any&#8221; symbol of hate in a public place when intended as an act of intimidation. That covers more than burning crosses, as envisioned in state law, Fielkow said.</p>
<p>It also defines the mere display as criminal, without an accompanying act such as vandalism or trespass.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fielkow said his proposal is born out of concern that incidents communicating hate are proliferating around the country since widely publicized racial unrest in Jena, which reportedly began with a noose left in a schoolyard oak tree allegedly to intimidate black students.</p>
<p>Several Jefferson Parish supervisors recently were disciplined for allowing a noose and several other racially charged symbols to be displayed in a government office.</p>
<p>Fielkow also read into the record nearly a dozen recent incidents around the country in which nooses were displayed for black people to find in offices or other work spaces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation included representatives of the city&rsquo;s Human Relations Commission; the Anti-Defamation League; the Urban League; the NAACP; the Forum for Equality, a gay rights advocacy group; and the Common Good, a broad, clergy-based nonprofit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the American Civil Liberties Union, which was not invited to the hearing, said it would oppose Fielkow&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an attempt to regulate people&rsquo;s thought processes. Our position is that people can be accountable for the harm they do, but not the thought underlying the harm,&#8221; Executive Director Marjorie Esman said.</p>
