						<p>A majority of U.S. Hispanics say the growing focus on illegal immigration has made their lives tougher.</p>
<p>The report, released Thursday by the Pew Hispanic Center, also found Hispanics tend to believe illegal immigration helps the United States more than it hurts. This belief is more common among immigrants, but more than half of U.S.-born Hispanics agree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics generally oppose measures used to find and deport illegal immigrants. Three-quarters oppose workplace raids and 79 percent local police identifying illegal immigrants, while just over half say states should not check for illegal immigrants applying for driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>

					<p>This is just further proof that, sadly, most Hispanics are more loyal to their race than they are to this country.  The immigration issue isn&rsquo;t just legal vs. illegal.  We must work to reduce <span class="caps">ALL </span>non-white immigration.</p>

					<p><i>A majority of <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Hispanics say the growing focus on illegal immigration has made their lives tougher.</i></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear Romanians of Filippinos talking like that. The only logical conclusion that follows from such a statement is that being &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; has strong statistical corelation to being (a relative of) an illegal alien. In particular, without &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; the illegal immigration would be an issue of secondary importance that does not call for defensive measures that are badly needed now.</p>
<p>One more reason to shut the border with Mexico down.</p>

					<p>It is pretty clear that all the Hispanics see themselves as a block standing against the Anglo culture of the <span class="caps">US.</span> Whether legal or illegal, they are working to take over the <span class="caps">US, </span>and they have no loyalty to the existing government of the US and its citizens and traditions. They are all invaders and it is time that we realized this for what it is: an invasion that is intent on driving Anglos out of north America. We must make a stand and hold on to what is ours.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m going to speculate that a lot of &ldquo;legal&rdquo; Hispanics are actively participating in helping illegals get to the United States. I can see how these &ldquo;legal&rdquo; Hispanics would gladly help their children, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, parents, mothers, fathers, and assortment of cousins, get to the land of the fat white people. </p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last few years calling, writing, faxing and emailing the powers-that-be. I&rsquo;ve had many form letters in return, none answering my questions - only stating how much they&rsquo;ve done against illegal immigration. If that were true, it would have been stopped by now. It continues because we have an open borders President and far too many politicians that profit by the invasion. Follow the money! We are being sacrificed so that our country can become the two-class nation that Mexico is now. I hope that Mr. Bush know his legacy will include his willingly handing over a superpower to a third world country. Mission Accomplished, Mr. President.</p>

					<p>IF Mexico is so great, why do they risk death to get to the <span class="caps">USA</span> And why once they get here are they so anxious to turn the <span class="caps">USA </span>into Mexico? One of the reasons is in Mexico there are no stupid Americans who will pave the streets with gold once they get there.</p>

					<p>The bias in their position is obvious, as are the implications for our nation if illegal immigration is not brought to a halt.  Yet we can&rsquo;t even <span class="caps">TALK </span>about it honestly in open channels without being attacked by the PC brigade.</p>

<p>What would stop &ldquo;legal&rdquo; immigrants from being on top of the pyramid scheme? getting $10k+ per head for assisting border crossings, then operate legal and criminal enterprises on their illegal resources, and then collect extortion $$? </p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t unlike the other mafia operations, including the notorious Asian mafias, with their $50K per head shipment, sweatshops, their chinese food factories&hellip;</p>

<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t generalize an entire ethnic group, even if it seems like &#8220;all of them&#8221; believe a certain way. There are plenty of American Hispanics, like those who belong to the group You Don&rsquo;t Speak For Me, who totally disagree with illegals and want them all deported. </p>

					<p>Remember the Mex football player several days ago who had the Mex flag etched on a tooth?  He said did it because he&rsquo;s proud to be Mexican.</p>
<p>How about the hundreds of thousands who fly the Mex flag, rant about how proud they are of being Mexican, and refuse to assimilate into the American culture?</p>
<p>And the millions who can&rsquo;t speak a word of English after being here for years?</p>
<p>To them I&rsquo;d like to ask:  &#8220;What is it about a failed society that refused to offer you jobs, educate you, and give you the same opportunities you have here, that you feel proud about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or does your pride have its basis in the fact that Mexico is the richest nation in Central and South America, yet is nothing more than a third world cess pool?&#8221;</p>
<p>And finally, I&rsquo;d like to ask, &#8220;If you&rsquo;re so proud of being a Mex, what are you doing here?&#8221;  Can&rsquo;t you stay in Mexico and nurture all that pride instead of turning our country into a third world ghetto like Mexico?</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s an understatement when considering history. prior to the recent displacement (genocide) of whites by the Mongoloids (circa 1000 AD), white civilization (homeland) extended all the way to Siberia and china. </p>

					<p>One can&rsquo;t help but laugh at the &#8220;plight of illegals.&#8221;  They brought this on themselves when they began marching for their rights.  It seems as if their plan has backfired and the only response we get now from them is quite elementary: feel sorry for us, or we will call you names.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t so infuriating, it would be comical.</p>
<p>Go back to your country and all of these problems will disappear immediately.</p>

					<p>To hear some posters on other forums, you would think that Hispanic-Americans are all against illegal Mexican aliens! They will bring up one or two cases of &#8220;proof&#8221; of that lie. What bull. Most &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are loyal only to their own <span class="caps">RACE, </span>period! They are not loyal to America (only to what they can get) or to White America and to it&rsquo;s founders, period. Just as Blacks are, so are the Hispanics. As for legal and illegal in the last 50 years, I can do without any immigration from the 3rd world, period. They will destroy what America was meant to be. We see that happening 24/7.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;d like to answer Robert Kelley&rsquo;s question about what makes a lot of Mexcans feel so proud about Mexico?  Well, it&rsquo;s not about Mexico for many of these malcontents,it is about sticking it to the people whos land you have invaded. Thus the saying, &#8220;we tend to hate those who we are dependent on.&#8221; <br>
You know, good old fashioned resentment of others, steming from jealousy and feelings of inferiority.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that the great majority of legal Mexican immigrants have family members at least as close as first cousins who are illegally in the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>(Just my rough impression from a few short but immersive visits to Mexico).</p>

					<p>Many of the legal Hispanics make money from the illegal hispanics. There are now a half dozen Mexican grocery stores in this area, probably owned by legal citizens but I would expect that many of their customers are illegals. The same with many businesses, owner legal, work force illegal. </p>

<p>I hear this from many, many of our activists. I can educate/train people like you on how to get heard, how to reach the real people, decision makers, behind the scenes staff members who do the work, filter public contact.</p>
<p>The key is to find the gate keepers, learn how to get in. Don&rsquo;t just rave and rant that &#8220;the politicians don&rsquo;t ever listen - throw the bums out&#8221;. With the knowledge about who, where, how and the key to the gate, you can get heard and make a huge difference for our side.</p>
<p>We recalled Gov. Gray Davis for going against us on drivers licenses for illegals. We won the San Diego 50the Congressional district (decided on immigration) we beat the illegal alien amnesty. We can build on victories like these. </p>
<p>E-mail me if you want some education on how to work to win.</p>

					<p>Not all Hispanics(mexicans) agree with this point of view.  I am<br>
of Mexican descent.  And No I do not support the illegals that<br><br>
come here and make trouble for people like me.  America has a bad<br><br>
habit of lumping everyone together.  I see the problems that illegals cause.  But I am powerless to do anything about it.  The<br><br>
illegals hate me for being born here and the whites hate me for<br><br>
being Mexican.  Me, I just hate everybody.</p>

					<p>This doesn&rsquo;t jibe with what I experience around these parts. </p>
<p>Virtually every Mexican-American I know hates Mexican nationals and wants them all deported. Of course, most Mexican-Americans around here seem to be people descended from pre-1965 legal immigrants and not anchor babies and their descendants like in Commiefornia. Most of them celebrate the fourth of July and don&rsquo;t know or even care what Cinco de Mayo is.</p>
