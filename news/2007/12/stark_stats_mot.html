						<p>A middle-aged white guy is inciting a black power movement from a quiet corner of the Smoky Hill High School cafeteria. </p>
<p>Bill Richardson &mdash; the math teacher, not the presidential candidate &mdash; is a numbers man motivating a growing band of African-American boys with statistics they have memorized like their cellphone numbers. </p>
<p>One in three will serve time in prison, projections show. </p>
<p>They will score 13 percent lower than white students on their ACTs. </p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll likely earn $20,000 less per year after graduation. </p>
<p>So members of The Brotherhood, as they call themselves, come to school early and stay late working to &ldquo;kill the gap&rdquo; and &ldquo;blow up the statistics&rdquo; against them. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought, this is a joke &mdash; there&rsquo;s no way a white guy&rsquo;s going to lead a black group,&rdquo; says Aaron Giron, one of the first kids recruited. </p>
<p>Richardson pressed on, firing up students the only way he knew how &mdash; with numbers that would strike fear in any black student coming of age in America. It&rsquo;s a white man&rsquo;s world, said the guy in the Dockers khakis. Be proud. Rise up against the stats. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 60-some members have boosted their marks an average of half a letter grade in the year since the group formed, Richardson says. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re no longer statistics,&rdquo; said 11th-grader Mike Seals, whose GPA has risen from a 2.3 to a 3.5. </p>
<p>About Richardson &mdash; Seals pays him the group&rsquo;s highest compliment: </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our biggest brother. We don&rsquo;t even notice anymore that he&rsquo;s white.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>      So what? Blacks can memorize just about as good as Whites<br>
can. So they memorize his statistics and then a few formulas and<br>
rules that boost their grades. So what-they still can&rsquo;t reason<br>
and understand what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re still not and never<br>
will be college material in the classic sense of the word.</p>

			<p>A number of posters have said that the &#8220;black community&#8221; will crucify Richardson. This is of course right, as everything whites do is evil to those people. Richardson would do well to pour out his altuism on whites who won&rsquo;t turn around and stab him in the back. </p>

			<p>I see it differently, the black boys lost their racisim. Now they don&rsquo;t care if the teacher is white. He now has their respect. Their new desire to learn has trumpted their racisits barriers. That is how blacks will assimilate and succeed when they drop their racisits barriers. <br>
How many times have you met a &#8220;normal&#8221; black guy and later you realized you didn&rsquo;t notice he was black. It is up to them to drop the barrier. It works.</p>

<p>Exactly!  That&rsquo;s what I think every time I read about some &#8220;miracle&#8221; after-school/summer school program that has managed to bring a select handful of poor blacks up to white standards through intensive remediation.  Journalists and teachers rave about how they&rsquo;ve finally found the key to educational equality, but never mention that the same effort <i>applied to whites</i> would have turned out <i>college-level</i> students and not just mediocre &#8220;average&#8221; students.  </p>
<p>I read an article a year ago about an experimental charter school (a KIPP academy, I think) that had increased the test scores of poor black 6th &amp; 7th graders <i>close</i> to white average levels.  I wish I had saved the link, but I remember the article quite well because it made me want to throw my laptop across the room.  The journalist proudly recounted their class schedule:</p>
<p>7am - full breakfast served to ALL students free of charge (thank you tax-payers!).  Bacon, eggs, toast, orange juice, etc.  No expense spared since the educators believed a heavy breakfast made the kids smarter.</p>
<p>7:30 - 2:30 - regular school day with intensive focus on basic skills in reading, writing, math and science. Class sizes were small and the school had strict discipline requirements with mandated class participation, uniforms, etc.  Trouble makers were kicked back to the public school system.  School provided free lunch, of course.</p>
<p>2:30 - 5:00 - mandated after school programs <i>on campus</i>.  Worst students spent this time in one-on-one tutoring with teachers, better students did sports or art.</p>
<p>5:00 - school-provided dinner in the cafeteria.  Yup, you read that right! The educators didn&rsquo;t trust the parents to feed the kids, and wanted to keep them on campus all day.  </p>
<p>Rest of the evening up to 8:30pm or so - SUPERVISED homework.  All the kids had to sit at tables and do their homework under the watchful eyes of their teachers.  The educators openly admitted that these kids would never do their homework if they weren&rsquo;t forced to, and the parents wouldn&rsquo;t make them do it either.  </p>
<p>The kids in this school ate all meals at the school free of charge during the week and only went home to sleep at night.  Last, but not least, was <i>SATURDAY school!!<i>  A half-day of intensive one-on-one tutoring with teachers and community volunteers, and free breakfast and lunch of course!  </i></i></p>
<p>The journalist admitted that this program was very expensive, but never mentioned that this program involved 3 to 4 times as much teaching time as a regular school.  Plus, it was <i>basically an orphanage without bedrooms.</i>  </p>
<p>Rather than tweaking standard public schooling, it merely proved that the only dependable way to &#8220;close the achievement gap&#8221; was spending 4 times as much time and effort, and to take parental duties away from their families and raise the kids under intensive care!  Any yet, this was clearly supposed to inspire whites to dump more money into this educational boondoggle.  </p>
<p>Absurd.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of pride.  People who have pride don&rsquo;t trash their lives or their communities.  We keep hearing stories about black children being tormented by their peers for acting white when they are doing what the school mandates.  Most of the black educators I know would never stand for this attitude.  Unfortunately the message of the schools has to be totally sold to the student by high school.  If not the chances for success are remote.  Anyone helping American students move forward deserves praise.  So the hell what if he&rsquo;s a white teacher of black students, they do exist.  I also didn&rsquo;t see anything in the story that was overtly anti-white.  I did see that the students no longer thought of his as white.  But I took that in the cultural context of acceptance, not the racial context of exclusion.  Sometimes reading between the lines doesn&rsquo;t reveal anything at all.  This is America and I expect ALL educators to help ALL students.  When you have the means to steer a risk group forward, it should be done to benefit America, not a racial agenda.  </p>
<p>I applaud the teachers who actually care and aren&rsquo;t just tenured government tit  suckers waiting to retire.  It will be interesting to see how this turns out, but this is not a unique story at all.  It happens daily.  Somehow these students have proven their value to the teacher and he is rewarding them in the best way; by educating them more.  Education is the only REAL investment.</p>
<p>This guy isn&rsquo;t a race traitor, he&rsquo;s just doing his job.  If he refused to educate black children he wouldn&rsquo;t have a job.  So are ALL of the white teachers in America race traitors?  No, they&rsquo;re government workers.</p>
<p>GH</p>
<p>PS:  Being white is not an act of racism.  Thinking all white people are racists is pure bigotry.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re no longer statistics,&rdquo; said 11th-grader Mike Seals, whose GPA has risen from a 2.3 to a 3.5.&#8221;  Yeah, but in what KIND of studies? My daughter graduated Magna Cum Laude from a prestigious Magnet school, however that same school was REQUIRED to set aside 20% of its student body for blacks. All those blacks had to do was maintain a 2.5 in &#8216;Average&rsquo; studies they could haved gotten anywhere else. The vast majority of students graduating with honors were White. Only one black graduated with &#8216;honors&rsquo; and she did so in the &#8216;Standard&rsquo; curriculum, not the &#8216;Advanced&rsquo; or &#8216;Gifted&rsquo; programs.</p>

<p>Exactly Jill. And what happens when the whites disappear and blacks take over the infrastructure (and education is an important part of infrastructure) of the society that whites have built up?</p>
<p>They back-slide. Or in other words &#8220;regression to the mean&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a genetic thing.<br>

			<p>Why waste all that money on black kids who will at best be average to mediocre students? Obviously, they would much rather be out with their homies if left to their own devices. </p>
<p>At best, we should offer good vocational training for kids who want to work. Again, why waste extra time, effort, and money on kids who won&rsquo;t aren&rsquo;t even average? They are obviously not suited for an academic environment. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind investing in academically bright non-criminal poor children so they can go to college and move onto professional and hi-tech careers. </p>
<p>We need to dump any kids who show traits of being incorrigibles or of criminality whether they get good grades or not. Youthful rebellion I understand but armed robbery, murder, rape, pimpin&rsquo;, hooking, and others, no way. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pay for kids wo harm our communities, let them fight it out amongst themselves, if they choose to kill each other, that&rsquo;s their&rsquo;s and their families&rsquo; business. </p>
<p>I am agreeable to having my tax money used to assist only people who show promise, track record of rehabilitation, and the motivation to rise above their circumstances.</p>

			<p>Jerry, you are right, at least in my view.  These kids have shucked off some of their own racism.  But this goes very much against the tide of many of the commenters here.</p>
<p>I knew a black in my barracks when I was stationed in Okinawa. Our association got started over music, of all things. He slowly and steadily shed the race chip and his lot in life improved greatly. He became an outcast with a lot of the &#8220;bruthahs&#8221;, but he soon no longer cared.  He stopped seeing himself as black first. He also did NOT allow the &#8220;bruthahs&#8221; to intimidate him into going back to the old attitudes.  Would that there were more like him.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s our biggest brother. We don&rsquo;t even notice anymore that he&rsquo;s white.&#8221; </p>
<p>In other words if he didn&rsquo;t bust his buns to cater to them, nor prostate himself at their feet, he would merit the normal amount of hate they give every white.</p>
<p>And, lo and behold, this little darling black lets it slip that he judges people by their race rather than as an individual when he says they don&rsquo;t even notice he&rsquo;s white anymore.</p>
<p>The rest of us, though, would still be hated, and it would be VERY apparent to them that we are supposed to be hated because they would &#8220;notice&#8221; we were white.  How reassuring of the reporter to put that in.  How heart-warming.</p>
<p>My, my, my.  How non-racist of them, and so open-minded too!</p>
<p>I wonder how many of them will rise to the incredible height of an average white student and go on to become another Afro-Centrist, claiming that blacks built the pyramids, invented most everything, and declare whites as the offspring of Satan?</p>

<p>This version of Isaiah that I quoted is actually found in the footnotes of Dr. Fishbein&rsquo;s stupendous Hebrew Scholars Bible.</p>
<p>He is quoting a fragment of parchment found at Elephantinae (I don&rsquo;t have time to check the spelling.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, Dr. Fishbein notes, the Jews at Elephantinae also worshipped a female consort of Jehovah. </p>

<p>Do white students have to come early and stay late? Do they need extra help and mentoring to close some alleged gap?  Why does that gap exist at all?   Is this not admission of some weakness, right there?</p>
<p>If I have to work twice as hard as you, and I must  put in ten hours to your five, just to get the same results,  then I&rsquo;m evidently up against more than I can handle. Why not just be honest and admit it?  It&rsquo;s so obvious!  </p>
<p>Instead of disproving anything about a achievement gap, this guy Richardson is only proving  it.</p>

  <br>
Sorry to tell you, but &#8220;succeeding&#8221; (economically) does not mean &#8220;assimilating.&#8221;  The only real and lasting assimilation is miscegenation.</p>

			<p> &#8220;But the power of a national elite&rsquo;s mythos overrules logic and common sense. And once the New England Yankees won the Civil War their mythos of seeing the American role to be to uplift the blacks and browns as part of the cultural war against various whites they saw/see as inferior to them became The National Mythos.&#8221;<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re right that he&rsquo;s doing his job.  OK.   No problem.   But  there&rsquo;s more to it than that.   The point of the comments by many posters here is that he is doing MORE than his job.  And that excess effort, while perhaps very commendable, is directed at helping  an exclusive racial group.  </p>
<p>This is NOT what he&rsquo;s getting paid to do.  It&rsquo;s over and beyond that, and apparently is  limited to some only,  on a  purely racial basis.  If he were to run a special program for white students only, he would be fired.</p>

			<p> The vast majority of students graduating with honors were White. Only one black graduated with &lsquo;honors&rsquo; and she did so in the &lsquo;Standard&rsquo; curriculum, not the &lsquo;Advanced&rsquo; or &lsquo;Gifted&rsquo; programs.<br>

			<p>From article: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a white man&rsquo;s world, said the guy in the Dockers khakis. Be proud. Rise up against the stats.</p>
<p>To the extent that these black students will interpret these statements to mean that they need to raise up against White people he is inciting racial hatred. That is not a viable method. </p>
<p>What would happen in that school if some teacher said it&rsquo;s a black criminal world, don&rsquo;t be a victim rise up against the stats?? Well we all know the answer to that, so I won&rsquo;t belabor the point.     <br>

These blacks should watch out for the Hispanics though; the collective guilt complex peculiar to whites is not a Hispanic problem.</p>

			<p>browser asked: &#8220;&ldquo;But the power of a national elite&rsquo;s mythos overrules logic and common sense.

<p>Just who are these mysterious Yankee elites (never identified) that some anonymous posters here like to rail against? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re onto something there in Yankeeland, however vaguely felt. But are YOU sure you got your powerful elites identified correctly?</p>
<p>The first paragraph of your post, btw, made excellent sense.</p>
<p>Posted by browser at 10:41 PM on January 1&#8221;</p>
<p>I identify the source: it came from Boston particularly and New England/upstate NY more generally - it is the secualr form of Puritanism. If you know nothing about it, you do not know American history. Without that culture of reform coming to dominate that area&rsquo;s education, journalism and politics, there would have been no civil war and no resulting reconstruction to destroy the white South while uplifting blacks. And that pattern has never left the country since Lee surrendered.</p>
<p>That means that a group of wealthy and powerful whites back to at least the 1820s have played a game of culture war in which they use blacks as pawns to dominate other whites.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer of VDARE says similar things. But he emphasizes more the desire of people to prove their superior democratic goodness by uplifting blacks and dumping on &#8216;other&rsquo; whites.</p>

Yes.  However, if those &#8220;starry eyed optimists&#8221; looked at this more realistically, it would occur to them to wonder:  If their premise is correct, then why should extra help be necesary?</p>

			<p>This is great news.  Whenever youfind young black paople who reject the brainwashing of the Affirmative Action-devouring Talented Tenth, we have something to be thankful for.  </p>
<p>You cannot expect the black elite to really give a damn (and they don&rsquo;t) since THEIR kids will suffer from Affirmative Action competition from smart ghetto trash like the kids Richarson is working with.  </p>
<p>Be thankful that Richardson is teaching them white cultural values of hard work and taking responsibility for your own life.  </p>
<p>Be thankful that the black elite hasn&rsquo;t destroyed the program he is working on (and they still may, since it is not black &#8220;owned and operated&#8221;).  </p>
<p>Be thankful they are assimilating to America and not trying to set up some nasty ghetto rap &#8220;black culture&#8221; of bastardy, drug use and violent crime.  </p>
<p>Be thankful they are not trotting out the segregationist &#8220;it&rsquo;s a black thing, you wouldn&rsquo;t unederstand&#8221; and &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; nonsense.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that black Americans, on average, are dumber than whites.  That does NOT mean that they cannot learn to become productive, white-acting American citizens performing up to the limits of their ability and be judged according to their merits, both intellectual and moral.* </p>
<p>I am so glad that Mr. Richardson has not been stopped (yet) by gutless, craven kow-towing school administrators, or by their masters: the race-hustling black elite.</p>
<p>{* I also believe we should not import any ignorant black folk from Africa or the Caribbean, due to the massive extra effort it takes to civilize them to Western norms of behavior.}</p>

			<p>There will always be a bottom 13 percentile no matter how much money, time and resources are wasted to move them up to the next 13 percentile as others will fall through the cracks to replace these utter failures of the &#8216;human&rsquo; race. It&rsquo;s a bit like catching the &#8216;10 most wanted&rsquo; as this creates another 10 vacancies. Far better to spend exactly the same effort on the TOP 13 percentile of those willing to be disciplined, attentive and eager to succeed with an immediate benefit to all. Losers are incapable of teaching other losers and it is a complete waste of human resources to use talented people to teach losers when they would be far happier, safer and successful in teaching those who are willing and able to be taught. From everything I have read on this site and elsewhere, black africans in USA have no aptitude whatsoever to learn anything useful to themselves and others. The only answer is total segregation. Having spent many years in africa, I can assure AMRENers that it works. Watch very carefully the ongoing electoral farce, murder and mayhem in kenya, a black african &#8216;governed&rsquo; black african country in black africa. South Africa is poised to go down the same road any day now, same power struggle between black african tribes, same slaughter, same outcome.. NOTHING! Just more black blood on the same machetes. mugabe has amply demonstrated over the past decade how he totally despises those black africans who are not of his tribe and how he is prepared to bring down his country rather than give up his corrupt power seat. There is no difference whatsoever between these events in black africa and how black africans behave in USA/UK or anywhere else White. Imagine if one of these gets to a position of real political power, boosted no doubt by this stupid &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; idea to put losers above winners just because the losers are black african.  Tribe against tribe. Kingston yardies against somalies or nigerians and all against Whites. No longer will we be watching it on international TV news but looking out of our shuttered windows. Pathetic education tactics have never worked and never will so segregate now and cease this evil pretence that black africans will ever succeed, and please don&rsquo;t quote a handful of those who have, as most of those have plenty of White genes to make the difference. Now sue me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This only proves that black boys were not really trying befor a white math teacher got their attention.&#8221;<br>
So is it inability, or pure laziness, that is at the root of the problem? <br>
Do black students really react favorably to being shamed into bettering themselves, more to the degree that they would be encouraged by an instructor of their own race?<br>
It would be interesting to see if any of these students make anything of themselves.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The journalist admitted that this program was very expensive, but never mentioned that this program involved 3 to 4 times as much teaching time as a regular school. Plus, it was basically an orphanage without bedrooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how much those poor teachers are being paid to work all of those hours? Charter schools generally pay far less than regular public schools and there are fewer benefits, no union, etc. This program does sound like an effective way to keep kids off the streets. So in that sense it is saving the taxpayers money because these are the same kids who would end up in detention centers.</p>

<p>Well I come from Upstate NY too, and it&rsquo;s very strange I&rsquo;m unaware of these mysterious powers who are pulling the strings behind the scenery.  A lot of things have changed there from the 1850&rsquo;s, you know.   (Or do you?) </p>
<p>I presume you&rsquo;re referring to the Transcendentalists.  In all my life, I&rsquo;ve never met any. I don&rsquo;t know if there are any left.   They were from another time.  But WHO is running the country TODAY?  Give us  <i>names.  </i>  I suggest you put down your Civil War history book and  look at the country as it is in 2007.   You&rsquo;ve got a lot of catching up to do.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m aware of what Steve Sailer says, and I fully agree, that there is a game in which well-to-do whites flaunt their superior virtue &#8220;by dumping on other whites&#8221;.  Absolutely! He&rsquo;s right.  Even so, those whites are just playing the game, saving themselves by betraying someone else.  They no longer set the rules of the game. They don&rsquo;t run the country as they did in 1865.  They didn&rsquo;t write the immigration law of 1965, or any of the other diversity mania that&rsquo;s been pushed on us. In that hundred years they&rsquo;ve lost power.  They&rsquo;re now just pawns who are going along with the program, being used, trying to save their own necks before their turn comes.</p>

			<p>I have mixed feelings about this.  As I have said in other posts, despite real genetically based differences between blacks and whites, there is no doubt in my mind that blacks could do better in this country than they&rsquo;re doing now.  What is holding them back is not us miscreant &#8220;racists&#8221; posting here on Amren, but their own poisonous black culture, made worse by our government entitlement programs.  So if Bill Richardson can inspire a few black students to apply what brains God gave them to improve their grades, that&rsquo;s for the good.  It&rsquo;s too bad he had to do it by portraying whites as a bogeyman that has to be beat.</p>
<p>Also, I note along with many others here that it often seems that the only way to educate blacks is to spend two to four times as much time and money on them as you would with whites or Asians.  Talk about sowing your seeds on infertile ground.</p>
<p>BTW, how come Chinese, Japanese, and Korean kids do so well in this &#8220;white man&rsquo;s world&#8221;?  And the Asians I know have succeeded without feeling any need to bash the white folk.</p>

			<p>The blacks are too blind &amp; lo-IQ to even address the awkward Asians who excel &amp; do better than whites in many cases. These Asians had no preferential treatments from white society, in fact they were treated worse than slaves at times and certainly discriminated against as much or more than blacks. Remember the Exclusion Act? Blacks are the most privileged in terms of being recipients affirmative action and political correctness. </p>
<p>Blacks hate to admit that it might be their problems that hold them back because they are blacks who don&rsquo;t perceive the world in a rational manner. It&rsquo;s a catch 22. Some smarter blacks realize what the problem is but are shouted down and stomped on by dumb blacks. White Liberals, please stop this nonsense and pay attention to your own children and your own community. </p>
<p>If you must &#8216;uplift&rsquo; somebody, focus your attention on people who will really benefit. Poor white and Asian kids!! </p>

<p>In point of fact,  Caribbean blacks are often better educated, more honest, and more motivated that most US blacks who are accustomed to having everything handed to them by the new massah, Uncle Sam. In the Caribbean, nothing was given to them; they had to work  and study for whatever they got.</p>

			<p>Asians do better because they have higher IQs, and I would bet <br>
(though I&rsquo;m not certain) that Asian males have less testosterone <br>
than blacks. If you spent the same money and effort on Asian <br>
kids, you&rsquo;d get much better results. Blacks on average are just <br>
not a race with a lot of intellectual capability. Athletics, <br>
music, and comedy are what they can do well, but the world <br>
doesn&rsquo;t need that many athletes, musicians, or comedians. </p>
<p>The solution, as others have pointed out, is to try and enforce <br>
basic values in black youth. This is why the decline of <br>
Christianity is a bad thing. Basic values are what they need. <br>
The &#8220;ghetto culture&#8221; of modern American Blacks is totally <br>
wrong. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Black Americans aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, so these <br>
problems need to be dealt with. It would be great if somehow <br>
blacks could selectively breed themselves up in capability, but <br>
that&rsquo;s as unlikely as repatriation. </p>

			<p>Well, they can still only look at their effort as &#8220;killing&#8221; or &#8220;blowing up&#8221; stats.  The psychology remains the same, and that will defeat them.</p>
<p>Pathetic whites have been trying to interest non-whites in cultural practices like the value of education for centuries now.  History shows that it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>On the other hand -</p>
<p>The quesiton is whether an educated black is less dangerous than an uneducated one.  We will either create a more moderate citizen, able to self examine and criticize, or more clever criminals.  In the end, it is cultural values that matter, not how well anyone can score on a test or even earn.</p>

You have made a very excellent point there.  An educated citizen is not necessarily a more moderate citizen. <br>
It&rsquo;s a variation on the admonition, &#8220;be careful what you wish for.&#8221;</p>
