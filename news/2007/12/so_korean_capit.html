						<p>South Korea&rsquo;s capital Seoul will expand payments to encourage couples to have more children and reverse the nation&rsquo;s ageing society, the city government said Friday.</p>
<p>Starting next month, families raising a third child aged six or younger will either get 100,000 won (106 dollars) in cash every month or 50 percent of the fee for the child&rsquo;s daytime care, the city said in a statement.</p>
<p>Payments were previously limited to families raising a third child aged three or younger and covered the entire fee for daytime care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After years of promoting family planning in the crowded nation of 49.4 million, the central government has become increasingly alarmed at the prospect of an ageing society &mdash; with a huge pensions bill and too few workers to sustain economic growth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fertility rate, or the average number of babies that a woman gives birth to during her lifetime, advanced to 1.13 in 2006 from a record low of 1.08 a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of this year the number of births reached 365,492, up 8.5 percent year-on-year, the health and welfare ministry said.<br>

			<p>The Koreans have a reputation as being a tough-minded people, which would figure, given that they have maintained a separate identity, despite being sandwiched between Japan and China.</p>
<p>With that said, I&rsquo;ve often wonder how the Koreans manage to tolerate the impulsive malcontents that too often (and quite sadly) tarnish the reputation of the United States military.</p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be much easier and cheaper to bring in african or middle eastern muslim immigrants to reverse the nation&rsquo;s aging society. I mean according to Jorge Bush we are all the same. It would be racist to think that there could possibly be any differences. And once they adjust to the differing levels of guns, germs and steel everything will be five-by-five. <br>

			<p>This policy is an example of just how racialy aware nonwhites the world over are and the lengths they will rightly go to in order to ensure racial homogeneity and ultimately, retention of indigenous homelands.</p>
<p>In other words, they readily employ measures that will help eliminate the risks of racial extinction and alien invasion, and takeover.</p>

<p>For the umpteenth time it&rsquo;s a catastrophic time bomb to increase national populations by immigration or high birth rates.  </p>
<p>And for the umpteenth time an imbalance of young and old citizens is not a demographic problem, but an accounting one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one nation on earth that can&rsquo;t adjust their systems to compensate for an imbalance of benefit payments relative to wage earners, through many options available to them.  The fools just don&rsquo;t want to make hard choices, nor do they want the decrease in consumer spending and taxes that having fewer people would mean to their economies.</p>
<p>As is usually the case, the real villain behind this push for more warm bodies is greed.</p>
<p>The population bomb could not only cause resource depletion and anarchy, but it could well mean the end to humanity.</p>

			<p>Korean immigrants are ok by me, they are productive and non-criminal and there aren&rsquo;t that many of them if compared to others. Korean&rsquo;s business whether they increase their population since they can take care of them. S. Korea is gearing up to care for N. Korea in case of &#8220;reunification&#8221; and provide most of current aid. N. Korea kicked out nonprofit orgs saying they don&rsquo;t need handouts anymore. I wish Africa would breed less and kick out their foreign feeders.</p>

			<p>I have a Korean friend who lives in LA and when we spoke about immigration a few weeks ago, he said that the United States SHOULD open our southern borders to Mexico because we need the workers to keep our economy rolling along.  I then asked him if his government thought the same way, did they welcome immigrants from other countries and if so, did they give them free medical care; educate them at the Korean taxpayers expense; give them food stamps and vouchers to pay their rent.  &#8216;Oh, no,&rsquo; he said.  If you want to eat, you have to work.  He always says that about his country.</p>
<p>By the way, he works for a Korean owned and operated company in the USA.  I foolishly asked him how many American citizens work in his  office in LA&hellip;&hellip;well, you guessed it.  Zip, Nada, Zero.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do as I do, do as I say.</p>

<p>I agree.  When the liberals in Northern Europe insist their countries need more people and that is why they are encouraging immigrants from muslim countries, that&rsquo;s a lame excuse.  </p>

<p>I agree, Robert!! especially considering the population density in South Korea is too high.  </p>
<p>I am the only child&hellip; and I grew up in Korea until I was fourteen&hellip; and I know nothing like the above existed when I was in Korea.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder how Japan is coping with their population&hellip; which has bigger than 2x south Korean population.  </p>
<p>in Korea, there are sometimes households with five girls or four girls with no boy or one boy&hellip;  in Korea there are some parents who would die to have a boy and they give birth until they get a boy.  </p>

			<p>well now that I am here let me continue babbling.  </p>
<p>I just read a very sad article.  In Seoul, Korea, there is a government-funded hospital for chronically sick children.  The hospital currently shelters about 240 children.  Many children have more than one handicaps.  Some children cannot see, some children cannot speak, and it is not even caused by the genes.  The workers at the hospital indicated that it happens when the mother does dangerously excessive smoking, drinking and legal/illegal drugs right before giving birth.  Half the kids have been abandoned by their birth parents and they never receive any visit from their parents.  Volunteers come everyday and care for the children.  And what the children want most from the volunteers is affection&hellip;  they just want to be in someone&rsquo;s arms.  When volunteers arrive, kids who cannot even see hear the volunteers&rsquo; voices and just run into the volunteers&rsquo; arms, screaming, &#8220;mommy, mommy!!&#8221;(in Korean)  and those are fortunate kids.  There are some kids who cannot even walk and they spend the rest of their lives on the bed.  and it is very difficult to separate a kid from a volunteer.  <br>

<p>Yes, Christianity and Catholicism.  Christianity is getting stronger and stronger in Japan too.  But there are muslim mosques in South Korea now&hellip;  South Korea started to import workers from muslim countries, and when there were enough workers, they built a mosque.  Of course I was not happy when I heard that.  </p>

			<p>There aren&rsquo;t that many Koreans here in the US because when compared to other populations in the world, they are miniscule. They appear to be clean, polite, and cosmopolitan especially compared to 3rd world peasants and former communist Eastern Europe and China. I have more issues with the Chinese because there are billions of Chinese who are just itching to get here and China is a tough place to live compared to the West.I say bar any low skilled immigration which would include lots of Chinese as well as Mexicans &amp; others. Eastern Europeans seem to come in 2 distinctly different flavors: highly educated and good citizens and the absolutely terrifying smart criminals. Keep the criminals out.</p>

<p>I think most people consider N. Asians to be lesser of many evils. Since legal immigration probably won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t be terminated at this time, many are trying to encourage and lobby for selective immigration policies. I actually agree with immigration policies allowing in people with higher IQs such as Europeans and N. Asians but not SE Asians, Phillipinos, or some E. Europeans. </p>
<p>Many Asians are cosmopolitan middle class people who are educated, secular or non-fanatically minded, business minded, skilled, and light skinned. However, even &#8220;white&#8221; middle easterners or many upper class Indians (see what happened to B. Bhutto) shouldn&rsquo;t qualify since many are muslims. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had bad experiences with uncouth shifty Eastern Europeans and many are not highly skilled or educated. They are generally poor desperate refugees fleeing very disagreeable circumstances back home. Gypsies being one component of this population.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Koreans, Japanese, and some Chinese, are actually quite compatible with the Western world since many of them are Christians and/or were very well educated in the West. They are also generally very westernized in their life style, thinking, and social behavior. They are also not angry and demanding towards whites but expect to work hard, stay out of trouble, and get ahead in life. They also will be less likely to drain funds from the social service/welfare or become homeless. Very old style American. And there are hardly any N. Asian muslims or terrorist.  </p>

			<p>Most of those low IQ Eastern Europeans you talk about are most probabaly gypsies and the like. Virtually all the Poles, Latvians, Hungarians, Russians, Czechs, Romanians etc&hellip; I have come across are clean, intelligent and more motivated and racially aware than western Europeans. And remember the Chinese have built advanced nations like Hongkong, Taiwan and Singapore. The difference between them and Koreans and Japanese are not much. I know of a Mongolian family settled in the UK who are clean, hard working, with no tendency to cheat or commit crime. Their kids integrated with the white kids in just a year. But somehow I am against North East Asians coming to Europe. I do not mind them in America as they are a high IQ group. But Europe is the mother continent and must be kept pure white.</p>

<p>The fact that asians are paying taxes doesn&rsquo;t mean that there isn&rsquo;t a huge cost associated to Asian immigration. Wherever they are numerous, Legal immigrant asians drive up housing costs and property taxes. And throw in a reasessment and White families end up paying 15 thousand dollars a year in taxes.When the asians move in, White Americans move out. This is a fact. You can see this in communities in California,NJ and LI. Legal asian imimgrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline are clearly causing hardship for White Americans.</p>
<p>Legal asian immigrants are also actively involved in the destruction of thousands of years of collective Native Born White Engineering,medical and scientific experience by promoting the H1-B an L1B visa policy.This is the first step down the road of genocide.</p>
<p>Let me make it very clear:the long term survival of Native Born White Americans within the nation they founded and created requires all non-white immigration to be completely shut down permanently.</p>
<p>The soft spot in your heart for Legal Asian immigrants is an insult to the Native Born White Americans victims of Legal Asian immigrants. You should check out the Victims Wall over at Brenda Walkers website. Horror story after horror story of Native American families destroyed by your nice gentle Legal Asian immigrants.</p>
<p>If White Nationalism means anything it is this:Legal Asian immigrants and their &#8220;America&#8221; born geneline are not interchangeable with Native Born White Americans street by street,town by town,city by city and state by state.</p>
<p>There is a lot that can be done to shut down Legal Asian immgration:shut down h1-b and l1b visa programs;a drastic reduction in the number of asian foriegn students allowed into US graduate schools and a complete end to the policy of family reunification.</p>
<p>White Nationalist should be openly advocate an Asian exclusion immigration policy just like the one America had in the past. The Asians in America are not our friends. They are our mortal enemy.</p>
<p>If America had maintained its pre-1965  national origins immigration policy, there would be no muslims here to ram planes into tall buildings and the korean teenager who slaughtered Native Born White teenagers on Southern State University campuses. </p>
<p>The resources of America are in fact scarce. Native Born White Americans should not be forced to compete with post-1965 Legal Asian immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line for the scarce resources of America.</p>
<p>Someone shoud explain to vdare.com&rsquo;s James Fulford that Legal Asian immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line are not racially interchangeable with the majority Native Born White population of America. The choice between Asians and Hispancs is a false choice.</p>
<p>There is no justification for Legal Asian imimgration. </p>

			<p>There are two issues with Chinese immigration that make it more undesirable than Korean immigration.  First is the history of Chinese immigrants working collectively to gain dominance over the people of host nations.  All over S.E. Asia, the Chinese are a &#8220;market dominant minority&#8221;, as the economists call it, owning grossly disproportionate shares of the local wealth.  It is easier, of course for them to cheat 3rd world Filipinos than 1st world Americans, but they&rsquo;re trying anyway.  We don&rsquo;t need it.<br>
     The second issue is numbers: there are over a billion of them and they could, if allowed, flood this country and still have a billion people back home.  Again, we don&rsquo;t need it. </p>

<p>Thanks, Jupiter. We now know EXACTLY where you stand. Yes, those dastardly Asian engineers, like Paul Kim (Founder of SureFire flashlights), Dr. Min Kao (Founder of Garmin), Charles Wang (Founder of Computer Associates), An Wang (Founder of Wang Labs and Wang Computers), Jerry Yang (Founder of Yahoo!), Steve Chen (Founder of YouTube)&hellip; THEY ARE THE WHITE MAN&rsquo;S MORTAL ENEMIES!!!!</p>
<p>Getting rid of the dastardly American gene-line of those awful Asians should be the White Man&rsquo;s number one priority; all white engineers and programmers that work for Asians should quit immediately because they are handing over the White Man&rsquo;s cultural right of science and technology.</p>
<p>Correct amundo?</p>

<p>I think the Chinese, Koreans, Mongolians, and Japanese have historically mixed with each other. Makes sense since they are in near geographical proximity to each other. The only difference with Mongolia is that it&rsquo;s not a high tech or advanced country so I don&rsquo;t know if the skills are competitive enough with other Asians. If they are, I&rsquo;d consider Mongolians same as other groups of N. asians. <br>

<p>Actually that isn&rsquo;t an option.  Although they migrated from South Korea most Korean migrants are in fact either born in North Korea or are the children of North Koreans.  I suspect that this is largely because it is so difficult to integrate into South Korean society - even for their brother Koreans.  </p>

			<p>Thanks for all your compliments towards Koreans&hellip; but even if there were no compliments regarding Koreans, I will still read AmRen regularly.  And regarding your complaints towards Korean immigration, I certainly understand&hellip;. and I am not angry a tiny bit with your complaints.  It does not matter how polite or intelligent Koreans are&hellip;. you built North America and you have every right to remain being the majority of the society.  </p>
<p>&#8220;<br>Note how South Korea has virtually zero immigration but south Koreans just love to immigrate to western countries. Hypocrites.&#8221;</p>
<p>No longer true.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know this story is about Korea trying to increase birth rates? Some of you posters took this as an opportunity to praise Korean and/or Asian immigration in the US.  Talk about having a hidden agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please, never ever hesitate to complain about Korean immigration.  I will not be angry because that point of view is reasonable.  And please never ever force yourself to falsely praise Koreans.  </p>
<p>If there is something I am wondering, what&rsquo;s wrong with international students studying in US Graduate schools?  Overwhelming majority of them are forced to go home when they finish studying, almost immediately.  And I know a white girl named Sarah Gibbons who finished her undergraduate from U of Toronto St. George campus and then currently working on her graduate degree in Ireland at a school named UCD.  She expects to finish her studying by the year 2012.  </p>
<p><br>
I am sorry, I know not many of you do not really appreciate it when I talk about things completely irrelevant, but I will keep going and keep babbling.  </p>
<p>My skin is lighter than other Asians from other parts of Asia and muslim countries and countries in Africa&hellip; and to be honest with you, I get a fair share of benefit for having the lighter North East Asian skin when I am out in public in Toronto.  Women of all colors never avoid me or are afraid when I start talking to them, I get loads of free samples whenever I walk around the malls, (they probably just want to make profit off me, I know) I am very rarely questioned by authorities, and so on.</p>
<p>At my school there is a black male&hellip; international student from Ghana, named Andrew Kofi Asare.  And there is something about him&hellip; he is loved by many Asian girls around him.  I have no clue what he does to earn all the affection from Asian girls.  A few weeks ago he received invitation to a Chinese girl&rsquo;s birthday party&hellip;  and he was one of the very first people who received invitation from her, and she was willing to reschedule her party just so it fits his schedule, and she kept reminding him to come to her party and her plans regarding her party.  I never received invitation&hellip;.  I eventually had to literally and openly plead two days before her party and I was allowed to come and she had to pretend that she was glad that I could join her party.</p>
<p>And there is a Venezuelan guy, named David Quintero&hellip; and he can never get enough of Asian girls.

			<p>let me add just a few more lines.  I have absolutely no trouble if whites forever remain the majority in North America&hellip;.  I will still work hard to be successful.  And I will never ever use that &#8220;I belong to a minority in North America&#8221; as an excuse.  That can never be a valid reason for not being successful.  If I want to be successful, I will have to be successful regardless of the size of my ethnic group in this society.  And I will not be successful at the price of white Americans.  I will not define that or view that as success.  </p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t mind if high IQ Asians come to America? Do you think Native Born White America is too stupid to produce physicians,engineers,scientists and computer programmers? Do you like the fact that the California State University system is now 40 percent Asian? </p>
<p>Would you like to import thousands of Japanese and give the grandchildren of the Japanese men who served in the Japnese Imperial Amy(these are the guys who tortured American prisoners of war to to death) a chance to colonize America?</p>
<p>My late father who was 17 years old when he served in WW11 went on-with the help of the GI bill-to become a mechanical engineer and produce a large Native Born White American Family. On two occasions, he was robbed of his job and wages by Asian LEGAL IMMIGRANT scab workers from Asian. MY father complained bitterly about this two weeks before he died.</p>

<p>There are people posting here who are  posing as White Nationalist who  have a hidden agenda.They see Legal Asian immigrants as beig interchangeable with Native Born White Americans. These phonies could care less about the damage Asian legal immigrants have done to Native Born White families. </p>
<p>This is a White Nationalist website. Any self-respecting Whie Nationalist must be opposed to the idea that Asian legal immigrants are demographically interchangeable with Native Born White Amerians within the borders of America.Asian Legal immigration does not come cheap and has been very destructive to thousands of Native Born White families across America(You got that James Fullford.)</p>
<p>If you have no problem with Legal Asian immigration, you are not a White Nationalist.</p>

As another poster have noted, we are not saying it is ideal to have any non-white immigration to America. Many are just being realistic and saying if we can&rsquo;t stop legal immigration immediately, then let&rsquo;s at least start filtering out the undesireables. The way I see it, this is the first step to hopefully ending much of legal immigration.</p>
<p>I would much rather let hi-IQ, educated, westernized, non-violent and non-criminal, hard working, family oriented, non-muslims into this country than let others in that don&rsquo;t share these traits.</p>
<p>Most N Asians, some Eastern Europeans, and of course most Europeans would fit this bill. I want all other legal immigration/refugees to stop from any other parts of the world. I don&rsquo;t know much about white farmers in S. Africa and as to whether we really need them and their skills. Watching some videos about poor S. Africans made me realize that many are in the underclass and not very educated or skilled. But I believe that we as Americans have a moral duty to accept them into this country and help them get on their feet and educate their children since we forced the end of white governments. We owe them that much.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try that &#8216;racialist&rsquo; guilt on me, I don&rsquo;t want low-IQ, lazy, criminal, addicted, and under privileged whites coming into this country either. Just because someone is white doesn&rsquo;t mean they are necessarily desireable. We have enough of them already in this country. Look who are the uneducated ghetto thugs&rsquo; baby mamas, welfare &#8220;queens&#8221;, hard core wiggers, criminals, pedophiles, and meth producers. No thank you!!!</p>

<p>If you support the continuation of Asian Legal immgration, you are supporting massive economic violence against thousands of Euro-American families across America. This has been going on since 1972.</p>
<p>Your rantings about not being realistic is jibberish. There movement to shut down skilled asisn legal immigrant scab workers which grows in scale with each passing year.</p>
<p>&#8220;White Natonalist&#8221; who utter nonesense about realistic immigration policy are closet race replacers.</p>
<p>If you are a White Natinalist you must oppose all non-White immigration. If you support the continuation of LEGAL asian immgration you are as much an enemy of Native Born White Americans as people who suppport hispanic illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; who utter jibberish about how advocating the shutting down of all Asian legal immgration have allowed the enemy to define the terms of the debate. What you and other phony White Nationalist are doing is perpetuating  the propaganda about America being an idea nation rather than a nation defined in terms of soil,blood and genes. </p>
<p>If we concede an inch to the enemy, WE will surely face over time complete economic and racial dispossion. The LEGAL immigrant Asians and their &#8220;Amerian&#8221; born gene-line are doing their part to bring about the economic and racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Note how South Korea has virtually zero immigration but south Koreans just love to immigrate to western countries. Hypocrites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No longer true.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much true.  About 1,200,000 foreigners (mostly Chinese) in a population of 89,000,000 (in both Koreas) comes to about 1.3% of the population.  It&rsquo;s hardly swamped by foreigners.  Frankly, Chinese living in Korea is akin to Germans living in Austria.  There isn&rsquo;t that much that distinguishes you physically from Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, never ever hesitate to complain about Korean immigration. I will not be angry because that point of view is reasonable. And please never ever force yourself to falsely praise Koreans.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about your feelings when I espouse my views and always strongly criticize immigrants into my country, including Koreans.  And yes, you do babble on about alot about nothing.</p>

I wasn&rsquo;t ranting. I was quite calm. I don&rsquo;t think it is feasible at this time to stop all legal immigration due to various powerful interests. Advocating for European or white only immigration will label you in the mainstream as racist, Nazi, evil, and other names. I certainly don&rsquo;t want people to dismiss my views as extreme, irrational, knee jerk, racist, hate filled, or just plain ignorant.  </p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve had good experience working with N. Asians and would prefer them over some Eastern Europeans. I am not advocating legalizing and opening for all N. Asians but in small number that would assimilate well and be of benefit to America.</p>
<p>If you feel that I am wrong then that&rsquo;s your opinion. I believe that I have a rational position on the current legal immigration situation and that more liberals are coming around to my way of thinking. </p>

			<p>Disgusted is somewhat correct. I still have lots of misgivings about making exceptions for &#8216;North Asians&rsquo; and don&rsquo;t want them here, but right now it is smarter to allow them in as oppose to other groups.</p>

<p>Please do not include both Koreas.  In North Korea, very very very few foreigners are allowed in.  And ones who are ever allowed in North Korea, they are most likely government personnels from South Korea or gov&rsquo;t personnels from other parts of the world, or writers/reporters with special permissions.  Not normal ordinary civilians or students.  They simply aren&rsquo;t allowed in North Korea.  There aren&rsquo;t even any normal tourists in North Korea.  And secondly, the Chinese is actually only a very small portion of the foreingers in Korea! I have not been to S. Korea in quite a few years, but my dad has, and he told me he has seen quite a few immigrants from West Asia in large cities.  A moderate number of them were men who came by themselves to get a job and make money in Korea.  The rest of their family members are usually back in their home countries.  When I was young and living in Korea, I have seen more Japanese folks than I have seen Chinese folks.  But the Japanese people were mostly tourists&hellip;  or students who came as exchange students.     </p>

I was born in South Korea, I grew up until I was fourteen, and I have never been to North Korea, and I have never met anyone from North Korea, and I have never met anyone who has paid a visit to North Korea.  I just remember seeing on TV Mr. So-and-so who works for the S. Korean government went to N. Korea to discuss something and came back.  </p>

<p>Speaking of Germany,</p>
<p>There are quite a few people in South Korea who insist that unification of Korea is not necessarily a good thing&hellip;  and they are usually the smartest people in S. Korea, who agree that S. Korea is better off staying separated.  When West Germany and East Germany had the unification, West Germany had to purchase all the corporations and infrastructure in East Germany, and West Germany had to re-write and modify everything in East Germany, and people in West Germany had to suffer various side affects such as higher taxes, and tougher job acquisitions&hellip;. I remember seeing pictures of a few West Germans carrying out intense demonstrations when Germany decided to have unification.  and it has been quite a few years since then and Germany is still experiencing symptoms from the negative side affects of the unification to this day, and the city of Berlin is under a very large debt right now.  </p>
<p>I heard it in the past, and I heard it first-hand from a German girl who came to Canada as an exchange student&hellip;.  she didn&rsquo;t come to my school though.  She went to York University.  </p>
<p>I feel so sorry for Germany because Germany indeed is one of my favourite countries in this world&hellip;. :( I love the cars designed in Germany.  </p>
<p>Me?  well&hellip;  if Korea does have unification, of course, it will take about 100 years for Korea to come back to stability, but after a long long time it will be beneficial for Korea.  <br>

<p>Your response to me is an just one of the many threats the &#8220;nice&#8221; LEGAL Asian immigrants have issued over the past few years to White Americans. </p>
<p>Native White Amerians did very well before the passage of the 1965-immigration refrom act. Since the passage of the 1965-immigration reform act, the economic status of Native Born White Americans has drastically declined. It is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Most of the new jobs LEGAL Asian immigrants are creating are in fact not going to Native Born Whie Americans. Paul Craig Roberts and Vdare.com&rsquo;s Ed Rubinstien have collected an enormous amount of data on this.</p>
<p>Lets perform the experiment though. Shut Asian immgration down to 0 and throw the Asian fifth column(this includes the aforementioned Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221;. Actually, tis experiment has already been performed:NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS were much beter off when the Asian population in America was very small. More later</p>

The main goal of White Nationalism should be the preservation of White genetic interests.  Allowing more of these North Asians into our country will only serve to further contaminate our gene line.  Aside from some of them having high IQs, they don&rsquo;t have prize winning genes nor or they aesthetically pleasant to look at.  My greatest fear is that miscegenation will eventually breed out all the qualities in Whites that make us special.  In 100 years, our skin might still be White (or probably beige) but no more blondes or redheads.  Our grandchildren will have big eyesockets, coarse dark horse-like hair and be a couple of inches shorter.  </p>
<p>No.  Immigration should be restricted to Europeans or people of European descent. </p>

			<p>A few more thoughts about 9.44 Dec 30 Asian supremacist rant. He says that Native Born American Tech workers should quit their jobs because for  their  of gratitude  for the good deeds of Charlie Wang and the other aforementioned predatory Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221;. They don&rsquo;t have to quit, for if  the aforementioned Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; have their way-and they may very well have their way since they own a large percetage of the traitors in the US Congress-Native Born White Tech workers at these companies can expect to be forced to train their LEGAL immigrant asian replacements and then fired.</p>
<p>Billionaire Asian &#8220;American&#8221; Charlie Wang-his hindu right hand man Sanjay Kumar  is now doing time in a Federal prison- threw several dozen 40 year White American Woman with families to support who worked at Computer Associates out of work with no health benefits. Charlie Wang has used his great wealth to turn Stony Brook University,now an asian campus-into a monument to China.</p>
<p>If the aforementioned Asians hadn&rsquo;t been allowed into OUR AMERICA, the White Tech workers at this companies would be employed at a higher real wage. Somebody else would have started similar companies,and deprived of LEGAL immigrant scab workers, a labor scarcity would force the real wage of these Native Born White Tech workers way up. And this would have been a very good thing.</p>
<p>I prefer a California State University system that was 90 percent Native Born White America like it was prior to the passage of the 1965-immigration reform act.</p>
<p>I have said this man times and I will say it again:Post- 1965 Asin LEGAL immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line are actively involved in the destruction of thousands of years of collective Native Born White Engneering experience. This is a catastrophe for Native Born White America.</p>

<p>Korean guy, I appreciate your efforts at reassurance. You have to understand, that the apparent hypersensitivity displayed by some posters here is because they are very alarmed, dismayed, and frustrated by what they see happening to the USA, Canada, and European countries. I am sure you would not be so sanguine about immigration on such a massive scale if it happened to your country of origin, so beware of reflexive double standards. In some ways you are similar to many whites in that you take your western environs and institutions for granted.  Its like fish don&rsquo;t know they are wet and that the water sustains them with life-sustaining oxygen. As another person said on a different thread, once the glue provided by the whites is lost,<br>
no one can predict the chaos that would ensue form the naked clash of tribal, ethnic self -interests. The West is doing something new in its history; groups of different ethnicities have always immigrated before, but their numbers were small and time was allowed for integration and assimilation. The mad rush we are seeing now I believe has no precedent except in cases of<br>
domination by military victors. Asians would never participate in such dangerous, unproven experiments.  This is new, uncharted territory, and the elites are hedging their bets by opening Swiss bank accounts, maintaining dual citizenship, and buying exotic property around the world if and when they eventually have to &#8220;bail out&#8221; from a potential societal implosion . Those are not good signs.  I do respect your ability to openly discuss the topics on this site without vitriol or an agenda; I think there is a part of you that is genuinely concerned about the welfare of whites and their great western civilization. </p>
<p>In my experience, the most maddening and frustrating thing is trying to talk about such sensitive issues with the average white person   &mdash;   they are absolutely the worst. Their eyes narrow, they fidget, mumble defensively, they retort with non-sequiturs, and become highly agitated when presented with facts.  Its as if they DONT WANT TO KNOW.  I have seem this same behaviour over and over again, so I know its not a coincidence; they are so thoroughly brainwashed I have finally given up on trying to educate them - they have become convinced that any act of white self-interest is de facto criminal and unethical. White people are truly their own worst enemies.  </p>

			<p>Everyone pay close attention to Asian Supremacist 11.45 post. His post reeks of contempt and hostile towards the Euro-American-the group that founded and created America. Notice how the Asian Supremacist demand that the Euro-America majority population hand larger and and larger sections of America over to the predatory post- 1965 LEGAL IMMIGRANT Asians and heir obnoxious &#8220;American&#8221; born gene-line.</p>
<p>The anger and hostilty of Native Born White America towards the predatory post-1965 Asian LEGAL immigrant lies just beneath the surface. The Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; are well aware of this. The anger and rage of Native Born White Americans towards Asian &#8220;America&#8221; was briefly uncorked on the days and weeks after 9/11. There was a very tense situation in the nation. At Tech companies across  America, the H-1 B visa thieves were recieving a massive amount of annoymous hate e-mail from their Native Born White co-workers. The situation got so bad  that it forced the tech companies to hire clinical psychologists to counsel the traumatize H-1 B Asin scab workers. This was a front page story in the NYT.</p>
<p>When Native Born White America decides it has had enough of Asian &#8220;American&#8221; racial politics which is bringing about the very rapid destruction of thousands of years of collective Native Born White American engineering experience, Legal Asian immigration will be brought dopwn to 0 and the Asian fifth column will be booted out of Silicon Valley and other places in OUR America.</p>
<p>Asian Legal immigration, what&rsquo;s in it for Native Born White America? Absolutely nothing.</p>

Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t think so should just google &#8220;violin playing robot.&#8221; It looks like South Korea and China will retain their identities as they industrialize.

I couldn&rsquo;t even finish that long winded post of yours without losing interest.  People don&rsquo;t come on here to look at your pictures or listen to you talk about your life, your friends, feelings, birthday parties or any other rubbish.  Do you not have anyone to share this stuff with in real life?  Are you looking for attention?  There are dozens of websites like Myspace or Mybook where you can showcase your life and chat away about all your teenage tripe.   </p>

<p>Al, one thing I&rsquo;ve notice about Asians is that no matter how educated they might be, they think in two dimensional terms, and therefore their writing style reflects this. <br>

<p>When I worked at The Home Depot, a customer brought up two clamps, one with a green vinyl handle and another with an orange.<br>
One of the clamps was SIGNIFICANTLY lower in price, such that when I rang it up, she asked why one costed so much more. I looked at them and one was made in China, the other in the USA.<br>
Other than that, they were both identical.</p>
<p>So, are you willing to pay cooley wages for an identical product?</p>
<p>The White elites certainly are. Jupiter apparently won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The masses continue to buy at Wal-Mart, so apparently they agree with the White elites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say Jupiter is on the loosing side of the economic argument for now.</p>

<p>Please insult the Asians with reasoned out and cogent point of view unless you are just there to troll. This just makes whites look bad. They apparently do better in English and essay writing according to stats on SAT.<br>

			<p>One thing I want to say: we need to be forever on guard not to get sucked into meaningless issues and debates.  I&rsquo;ve done quite a bit of traveling all over the world, and the situation for whites (middle class and below) is very dangerous, whether you live in the US, Canada, or Europe.  Whats occurring is that (for lack of a better label ) the white elites are becoming more and more estranged and alienated from their own lower class as a result of financial globalization and media-fed cultural/psychological war.<br>
This facilitates manipulation of both classes of whites - conquer by dividing your enemy is an ancient military precept. There is a World War III going on right now; the enemy is the white genomic<br>
population,  a war that is being carried out in the most subtle, indirect, incredibly sophisticated, media-driven manner, such that the target isn&rsquo;t even aware it is happening.</p>

			<p>12:55 AM: Since when did Orientals do better than Whites on essay exams?  I don&rsquo;t know what exactly is meant by two-dimensional thinking, but just because Chinese kids master American teen-talk doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can write good, idiomatic American English.  My teacher friends who have the misfortune of teaching writing to Orientals tell the parents not to send their kids to private tutors.   The Chinese tutors can&rsquo;t write either.  (Chinese lacks our past and future tenses.  If they want to tell you that they did something yesterday, they say &#8220;I do it yesterday&#8221;)  </p>

			<p>&#8220;East-Asia will dominate the 21st century because they retained their racial identities.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure of that.  As one poster already pointed out there is growing number of foreigners in these countries.  Small, yes, but there is definitely a trend there.  I also think they should be pressed into taking their share of the world&rsquo;s African refugees.  It would be hypocritical of some of you Asian posters to think that America doesn&rsquo;t belong to us but to the world and not apply that to your own homelands.  I also think we should shut down all of our military bases around the world and send our troops home.  Since America is a nation in a steady decline, we can no longer afford to pay for these overseas military installations.  Japan is one of the richest nations in the world and yet we are providing for their defense?  Pulling out would force them to spend some more of their GDP on their military.  The same goes for Korea.  Bring those troops home and stop selling armaments to Taiwan.  It would be interesting to watch the cascade effect on East Asian economies when China invades Taiwan and North Korea invades the south.  This in turn would force an arms race between Japan and China and destabilize the region.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Japan is one of the richest nations in the world and yet we are providing for their defense? &#8220;</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s defense budget is either forth (SIPRI) or fifth (CIA) largest in the world (2004-2005).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_budget_of_Japan" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_budget_of_Japan</a></p>
<p>Japan spends about $50 BILLION a year for defense, and &#8220;With nearly 240,000 military personnel and an annual budget of close to $50 billion, Japan&rsquo;s military outstrips Britain&rsquo;s in total spending and manpower, while its navy in particular scores high among experts for its sophistication.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/jda.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/jda.htm</a></p>
<p>Japan is our fall back East Asian base once the South Koreans kick us out. The USA will hand over operational control of the ROK army in 2012, so we on our way OUT in about four years. Which means they will be indispensible if PRC attacks Taiwan and the US decided that it is in our national interests to defend them. Whether or not we could successfully retake Taiwan is a big question mark, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

			<p>I just came home from a snowboarding trip to Quebec at a resort named St. Anne, (I also ate a lot and gained a few pounds) I have a lot of emails to write back to, (and I am looking at the pictures now.  They are so sweet)</p>
<p>I do not speak perfect English.  I do not write the most beautiful essays in this world, and that is ok, I am totally fine with that.  I do not plan to make my living or change this world by writing masterpiece essays.  If that was my intention, I would have chosen a different major at my school.  Or some other school.</p>
<p><br>
A1, well, I did not read all of your post, but I will respond anyways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you also remember attacking me on that same board for criticizing black women and saying you would never criticize a woman of any race and then doing it yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>1. I wonder when I criticized a woman.<br>
2. Maybe you meant facebook when you said &#8220;Mybook&#8221;.<br>
3. I never lied.  All I said was there are just a few Asians who date whites, but when they do it is not our intention that we want to destroy the white race.  </p>
<p>I am losing interest in posting on AmRen little by little&hellip;  but it still is one of my favourite sites on the internet.  (but how much I admire and respect white people has not changed a bit and I know it never will)</p>
<p>and when I said &#8220;A1, is that you?&#8221; I mostly intended to amuse other readers on AmRen..  I was not even talking to you to be honest.  and when I indicate my name as something related to Apple&rsquo;s iPod, I also simply wanted to amuse one of the readers on AmRen.  </p>
<p>From now on, say whatever you want to say to me, respond to all my posts, but you will not hear me saying a thing directed to you ever again.  I do not have much intention to talk to you, I wonder why you keep reading and responding to my posts if you despise me and hate my words, I did already recommend you ignoring my posts in the past, </p>
<p>And I will gladly say it one more time and for the last time.  When I make posts on AmRen, I am not talking to you or other people who do not appreciate me.  When I make posts on AmRen, I make my posts for the benefit of AmRen members who wonder about other parts of the world and I happen to have some information that can help them, and I provide information to my best knowledge.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Congratulations, A1. you will never ever have to put up with me talking to you ever again.  </p>

<p> I must take very strong exception to what you say. The U.S. should leave Korea to it&rsquo;s own affairs. Let Japan defend itself. WHY does the U.S. &#8220;NEED&#8221; a &#8220;fall-back&#8221; position in Asia??? And WHY is it in the &#8220;national interest&#8221; of the American people to fight what would be a major war against nuclear-armed most populous country on earth over Taiwan for?? WHAT POSSIBLE &#8220;VITAL INTEREST&#8221; CAN TAIWAN POSSIBLY REPRESENT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA??? This small obscure island off the coast of China is no more important to America then Hainan island is. Do you really want American servicemen to die for Taiwan??? What for? How many dead servicemen will satisfy you? 10,000? 20,000? If it took 50,000 American dead to save Taiwan would you be prepared to accept that? What the hell for?? I presume you won&rsquo;t be doing any of the fighting? The only legitimate job of the U.S. military is to protect the national territory of the United States and defend American lives. That&rsquo;s it. Period. The U.S. armed forces should not be some sort of (unpaid by the way) mercenary force at the disposal of other countries. I think you may have watched too many episodes of the old TV show &#8220;Have gun, will travel&#8221;.  </p>

Your absolutely right.  Let&rsquo;s not forget these nations are competitors.  Why should our bankrupt nation borrow more money to protect them?  Pull out every single troop and close every base in Asia and watch the fun start.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t attemptng to get into an argument here, just stating facts. &#8220;Let Japan defend itself.&#8221; Fine; this will require a change of the Japanese Constitution, one which many Japanese Right-wingers have been urging for years. It will then be not out of the realm of possibility a thermonuclear weapon armed Japan. We are being kicked out of South Korea as practical matter in a couple of years.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;WHY does the U.S. &ldquo;NEED&rdquo; a &ldquo;fall-back&rdquo; position in Asia???&#8221; Let me say this: OUR trade with the rest of the world is basically carried on the backs of ships. Yes, we trade with Canada and South of the border, but everything else essentially comes on ships. Do YOU want someone else to control the high seas which trade depends on? If not, then we need to have a friendly port: Japan. Japan has even changed their laws to accomodate US nuclear powered aircraft carriers that wil replace the Kitty Hawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;WHAT POSSIBLE &ldquo;VITAL INTEREST&rdquo; CAN TAIWAN POSSIBLY REPRESENT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA??? &#8220;</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the movie &#8220;Pork Chop Hill,&#8221; based on the book by SLA Marshall?</p>
<p>Essentially, the worth of a piece of land in war is what you are willing to pay for it. The USA decided that Korea was outside of it&rsquo;s &#8220;vital interest&#8221; pre-1950. That was a greenlight for the communists to attack.</p>

<p> So then let Japan change it&rsquo;s constitution. SO WHAT? Perhaps it should since it was written in a different era. So what if Japan decides to acquire nuclear weapons. France and Britain have them. China has had them for many years. What are you suggesting??? That a nuclear armed Japan is going to launch a strike on all the cities of the west coast of America? I don&rsquo;t see how the emergence of Japan as a nuclear power - if they even decide to go that way which I think is extremely unlikely because the issue is a major shibboleth there - should concern America. Japan is now a stable democracy not the wild militarist country of the 1930&rsquo;s. You watch too many old war movies friend.  </p>
<p> WHO is going to &#8220;control&#8221; the high seas? I see no major maritime power emerging to &#8220;control&#8221; the high seas. How would they &#8220;control It&#8221;?  We don&rsquo;t need a &#8216;friendly port&rsquo; for aircraft carriers to have trade. Look at all the trade we do with China. What friendly port do we have their for our ships? Why do we need naval bases all across Asia for merchant marine ships to ply their trade? This is the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard in my life. This isn&rsquo;t the Spanish Main or the Barbary coast. I think you watch to many old pirate movies.  </p>
<p> Sorry Friend but South Korea is NOT a vital interest of the United States. It wasn&rsquo;t in 1950 and it isn&rsquo;t today (with all due respect to your Pork Chop Hill movie). South Korea was no more important to us then South Vietman was. <br>
 YOU ARE RIGHT that nations should clearly state what their VITAL INTERESTS ARE and let it be known they are prepared to defend them but you have only a very, very, very foggy idea of what actually constitutes those very vital interests.</p>
<p> Tell you what, why don&rsquo;t you stop watching TV MOVIES and read a good book. I suggest &#8216;THE EMPIRE HAS NO CLOTHES&rsquo; by Ivan Leland.</p>

<p>Either we are or are not a global power; I contend we are both a Pacific and Atlantic power. As such, we need the ability to actually PROJECT power. Now, you can certainly come up with all sorts negatives (&#8220;Empires&#8221; etc.) to disassociate us from this notion, but that does NOT negate the necessity to have the means at hand to do something that needs to be done - IF we consider such things in the &#8220;national interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Century, the 20Th, certainly took us places we would never have envisioned in the mid-19th century. If you think we don&rsquo;t need bases in Japan; fine. If you think other alliances won&rsquo;t rise to oppose the US, fine. But don&rsquo;t hink for a moment that just because we have an ocean on both sides of us entitles us to actually think we are IMMUNE to the pressure of others militarily.</p>
