						<p>Perpetrators of sexual abuse against children are as young as nine years old and there has also been an increase in the past year of younger victims of sexual and other forms of abuse, according to two of Cape Town&rsquo;s organisations.</p>
<p>Synnov Skorge, director of the Sarah Baartman Centre for Women and Children near Manenberg, said they had seen an increase in the number of younger children being sexually abused with a &#8220;large number&#8221; of victims under five years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;The behavioural problems are frightening when you start seeing young children showing signs of depression, sleep and eating disorders. We are dealing with very, very traumatised children,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;The behavioural problems are frightening&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Skorge said their centre had also seen a 30 percent increase in the past year of women coming to their shelter while the number of women seeking legal advice had doubled to 420 this year.</p>
<p>She said in the past year their centre alone had seen 253 women about different forms of abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also seen an increase in abuse related to drugs, not saying that it is a cause but where it has definitely been a factor,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said in the past year it had become obvious that drugs, and especially tik, played a part in various forms of domestic abuse.</p>
<p>Skorge said the link between drugs and sexual and other forms of abuse had become clear in the past year with tik being used in many houses where these incidents occurred, mostly by perpetrators but also by victims, to cope with the effects of the abuse.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;There is a huge problem for women around assistance from police&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>She said there had also been an increase in boys who were addicted to tik abusing their mothers.</p>
<p>Skorge added that it was a well-known fact that in most instances the perpetrator was known to the victim, but said a &#8220;frightening&#8221; increase was the growing number of young perpetrators.</p>
<p>She said in one case a child of only nine years old had sexually abused other children.</p>
<p>Skorge said women were also facing &#8220;huge problems&#8221; with getting help.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a huge problem for women around assistance from police and there aren&rsquo;t enough services and shelters available for them. Also, the justice system needs to be improved drastically so that women have a more positive experience with it and, on the other hand, perpetrators need to pay. The impression we are getting is that they are getting away with murder &mdash; and that is exactly what men are getting away with,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Nazma Hendricks, counselling co-ordinator at the Rape Crisis Cape Town Centre in Athlone, said they had also seen a trend towards younger rape survivors in the last two years.</p>
<p>She said that 70 to 80 percent of the time the perpetrator was known to the victim and the relationships were often very intimate. She said the abuse of children by fathers or stepfathers was increasing as well as women suffering sexual and other kinds of abuse from their partners.</p>
<p>Hendricks said the centre had become very busy in the past year.</p>
<p>Last year they saw an average of 12 new clients a month; this year they were seeing 20 a month.</p>
<p>She said that although the increase was not a good sign, it showed that survivors were &#8220;taking their power back&#8221; with more of them coming in for counselling.</p>
<p># The Sarah Baartman Centre for Women and Children, along with the 14 organisations it is affiliated with, was due to stage a protest along Klipfontein Road on Friday morning calling for proper implementation of legislation relating to the abuse of women and children.</p>
<p># Rape Crisis Cape Town is also currently touring rural towns with its campaign called Stop the Bus, where it is offering workshops and networking opportunities related to rape and sexual violence as part of the 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Child Abuse.</p>

			<p>Reading the headline, &#8220;Rape Victims Getting Younger in S.A.&#8221;   &mdash;   No surprise here. Given the reality the perps are Black Africans. Didn&rsquo;t we have a story less than a month ago. About an American Black   &mdash;   charged with RAPING an infant?</p>

<p>If things keep going downhill in Africa, it won&rsquo;t be any better than Atlanta, Detroit, L.A., Chicago, Miami, New York, and New Orleans.</p>

			<p>Are you surprised ?? This is just one of the legion of reasons white South Africa wanted to develop seperately from the others. Where you have a criminal government in place criminals will thrive and the worst in man will be brought to the surface. We have always known these things (just like we cannot fathom the debate around the Watson findings) but, as I&rsquo;ve said before on this website, the outside world did not want to believe us.</p>

			<p>So what is this stuff called &#8220;tik&#8221;?</p>
<p>First time I have ever heard of it. Looks like those South Africans have come up with some kind of inovation  &mdash;   a new way to make their society even worse than it is already.</p>

			<p>All the world is comming under Liberal doctrine, and all the world is collapsing back to the stone age. Japan and China, India, and Muslim run countries are the conservative countries. Any guess at who is going to succeed White Europeans the next century?</p>

			<p>&#8220;So what is this stuff called &ldquo;tik&rdquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems to be the local name for methamphetamine.  Looks to be doing wonders for the local youth.</p>

			<p>For a 9-year-old boy to even have the idea of raping a girl, he would have to have been raped himself. Kids don&rsquo;t think of that stuff all by themselves. </p>

			<p>None of this will come as a surprise to any White who has any experience of black africa. These black africans have done this to one another for hundreds if not thousands of years. Just today, one, just one, black african made the UK TV news by gaining a certificate from a Manchester school. Big deal. How long will he last on the streets of the renamed &#8216;gunchester&rsquo;. Blacks kill blacks everyday in UK, which  causes me no concern whatsoever. I am not a black african and do not mix with them.</p>

			<p>I fear for the white women in South Africa. They are prime targets, who must constantly live in fear and hiding. <br>
We need to rescue our white brothers and sisters remaining there. Cannot Russia or other  of the white countries with declining white populations take them in????</p>

			<p>Tik is a meth amphetamine smoked from a light bulb through a straw. The name is derived from the sound the drug makes when lit. This drug is addictive almost immediately and has a reputation of destroying mind and body in record time and leads to extreme aggression and lack of empathy/sympathy. The remnants of this drug apparently stays in the body for ever and sudden relapses are frequent. The scourge is especially wide spread on the Cape Flats among the coloured community - who will commit any crime to fund the next fix.<br>
PS at a recent political rally Pres Thabo Mbeki did not know what tik is - which goes to show how in touch the elite is with reality on the ground.</p>

			<p>I had a friend who was an intern at a North Philadelphia Hospital back in the 60s who was on ER duty when a 6 month old  black baby girl was admitted who had been sexually penetrated. I won&rsquo;t even go into the horrors of the injuries that the child suffered. I think that you can imagine it. The perpetrator was a family member.</p>
