						<p>Arizona steel fabricator Sheridan Bailey has been laying off employees in recent weeks even though he has plenty of orders on the books.</p>
<p>His firm, Ironco Enterprises, shed around 10 percent of its 100-strong workforce to get in line with a state law going into effect on Tuesday that targets employers who hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have let some people go who we came to know were not properly documented. So in that respect the law is already doing what the framers expected,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The maker of steel frames for buildings is among an estimated 150,000 businesses across the desert state preparing for the measure that places Arizona at the vanguard of more than 100 U.S. states and municipalities taking on immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The law, passed days after a federal immigration overhaul died in the U.S. Senate in June, punishes first-time violators who knowingly hire undocumented workers with a 10-day suspension of their business licenses.</p>
<p>A second offense means they lose it.</p>
<p>The measure also requires employers to use an online federal database, dubbed &ldquo;E-Verify,&rdquo; to check the employment eligibility of new hires in the border state, which is home to an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Many employers like Bailey say they are pruning their workforce of illegal immigrants to avoid prosecution, or have outsourced some operations to neighboring states and even over the border to Mexico.</p>
<p>Other businesses have put a freeze on expansion in Arizona out of fear they will face prosecution should they inadvertently hire an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too much of a risk for us,&rdquo; said Jason LeVecke, a franchise owner who operates a chain of 57 Carl&rsquo;s Jr. hamburger restaurants in the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A coalition of business groups filed suit to block the measure, arguing that it will be harmful to local businesses. A U.S. District Court threw out the challenge earlier this month, but a new suit has since been filed.</p>
<p>Lawyers opposed to the employer sanctions law say that it is unconstitutional and is open to abuse by people making malicious anonymous complaints. They warn that it will also make Arizona less competitive nationally.</p>

			<p>This is a fantastic law, very shocked that it ever became law, there&rsquo;s already lawyers filing briefs, the racist thugs from la raza screaming, p.c. crowd crying, gotta be a good law.  Only trouble is, these illegals leaving Arizona won&rsquo;t go back to Mexico, they will be dispersed to sanctuary states.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Americans might return to some of the manufacturing and service jobs that they were previously denied. And at fair wages. Plus, AZ might become a nice place to live or vacation in once again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope your right but I used to live in Phoenix before I moved back East 10 years ago.  There&rsquo;s a large legal Mexican population there and it&rsquo;s growing steadily.  <br>

			<p>Congrats to the Grand Canyon State on making this important first step on the road to racial recovery! </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s wishing you folks further success in making Arizona an &#8220;arid zone&#8221; for resource-draining, culture-killing illegals. </p>

			<p>I always thought that they should get the lazy loafers off of welfare&hellip;you know the ones who plop out one baby after another to get even more welfare&hellip;if they do that&hellip;bye bye to the illegals and hello to shipping the mexican loafers back across the border.. you know if we shut off welfare the mex&rsquo;s will go home and the trash living off of welfare for generations will finally give back to society&hellip;by doing what the rest of us do that bad ole four letter word&hellip;.WORK!!!</p>

			<p> If every state simply followed the laws as written all wages would rise and every job would be filled the stupid greedheads in Corporate America is growing fat on illeagle labor and they are going to bring every tactic they can to frustrate the will of the people and I&rsquo;d not be surprised by out and out violence to support their immoral profits. The good news is in the end the people will emerge victorious and the greedheads will be laid low.</p>

			<p>Pirates sailing the Spanish Main in the days of old had more morals than America&rsquo;s business class&hellip;the Chamber of Corruption has been the motor behind efforts to turn America into a third-world sewer. Note that even the non-White immigrant &#8220;activists&#8221; shrieking in the streets and waving red flags all run on big business-generated foundation money.</p>
<p>It was the same big business types who tried to squelch news of the Knoxville Massacre because it &#8220;threatened racial harmony&#8221;&hellip;one year ago, R.I.P. Channon and Chris.</p>
<p>Before America can be saved, the power of big business must be broken. </p>

			<p>Who do they think they are kidding. NOTHING will be done, and only token prosecutions will take place for businesses that do not grease the local palms of politicians. This law has no teeth! And its a law that Sheriff Joe cannot police. And that article stating that Illegals are leaving on their own is a LIE!</p>
