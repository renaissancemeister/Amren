						<p>A 10-month search for a serial robber-rapist targeting young males in the Baytown area has led to the arrest of a 19-year-old Baytown man.</p>
<p>This case has set a precedent as the first male-on-male serial rapist that the FBI has ever psychologically profiled, Baytown Police Capt. Roger Clifford said Wednesday.</p>
<p>At midnight Tuesday, Keith Chester Hill, 19, was taken into custody at his parents&rsquo; recently built two-story, brown brick home at 6703 Zeenat in the Tanglewilde subdivision in Baytown. His parents, Phillip and Sherry, would not answer their door to comment.</p>
<p>Hill is being held on $60,000 bail on two charges of aggravated robbery and one charge of aggravated sexual assault, but additional charges are expected, investigators said.</p>
<p>FBI specialists from Virginia came to Baytown to look at detailed reports of the investigation and to develop a psychological profile of the attacker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FBI concocted a possible profile based on past female victims, and only some of the characteristics seemed to fit, such as the attacker being cocky and thinking he was smarter than the police, Clifford said.</p>
<p>Although the attacker robbed his victims at gunpoint, his major motivation was to gain &#8220;domination and sexual gratification,&#8221; Clifford said. The attacker was armed with a gun and demanded money and sex from his victims, pistol-whipping one who was not compliant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Residents have posted sketches of the attacker every place they could, demanding to know who was terrorizing their area.</p>
<p>All the victims had &#8220;cookie cutter&#8221; similarities: young white males, in their late teens to early 20s who were still living at home. Investigators think the rapist carefully stalked each of the victims and then attacked them on the driveways to their homes or surprised them inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were all slender and a little smaller stature than Hill,&#8221; Clifford said. Hill is 6-foot-1 and weighs 170 pounds.</p>
<p>Although the attacker was reported to be black with light skin and all the victims were white, Clifford said that race was not an issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was just the type that he was physically attracted to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Just after Christmas, one of the victims reported seeing something that he felt &#8220;pointed toward Hill&#8221; as possibly being the attacker, but Clifford would not specify what that was.</p>
<p>Baytown Detectives J.R. Miller and Bryan Thompson had also collected a DNA specimen that came from an attack in May. It turned out to be a match to a specimen voluntarily submitted by Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s only one in a quadrillion chance that this DNA from the attack could come from someone else,&#8221; Clifford said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hill, a 2006 graduate of Ross S. Sterling in Baytown, is unemployed and not attending school, investigators said.</p>

															<h2><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/4539038.html">Prosecutor: Serial Rapist Stalked Man For Days</a></h2>
											<p>
							<i>Brian Rogers, Houston Chronicle, Feb. 9, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>An accused serial robber-rapist followed one man home several days before he eventually hid in bushes to surprise the victim with a gun, a prosecutor said Thursday.</p>
<p>The details emerged in a court hearing in which Harris County prosecutor Cameron Calligan described how Keith Chester Hill, 19, allegedly kidnapped a Baytown man from his home, robbed him and forced him to have oral sex.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the case that led to charges against Hill, Calligan said in court that the suspect confronted the man at his home, tied his hands and taped his eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>Hill drove the victim to an ATM and used the victim&rsquo;s debit card to withdraw money twice, Calligan said. They then went to a secluded area where Hill forced the victim to perform oral sex on him. Hill then hit the victim in the head with the pistol.</p>
<p>Outside the car, Hill lay with his naked victim in a field, Calligan said, then took photos that he later posted on his My Space Web page. After cutting the ties off of the victim&rsquo;s hands, Hill hurriedly left.</p>
<p>State District Judge Don Stricklin raised Hill&rsquo;s bail from $60,000 to $200,000 after Calligan said the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office intends to charge Hill with aggravated robbery in a case involving a second victim.</p>
