<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>When Lee Williams saw a parent-and-toddler session advertised at his local pool, he thought it was the perfect chance to teach his young daughter to swim.</p>
<p>Arriving at the leisure centre already in her swimming costume, two-year-old Darby was desperate to get into the water.</p>
<p>But she was left in tears when staff said they were not allowed in the pool because the session was for Muslim women and their children only.</p>
<p>Mr Williams, 34, bitterly criticised Manchester City Council yesterday after it admitted that advertising for the session, on its website and on leaflets, had been misleading. &lsquo;I can understand why Muslim women need to have this kind of session, but the council should not be advertising it as parent and toddler,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They made out I&rsquo;d got it wrong, but I had checked on the council&rsquo;s website for the times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The incident happened at Abraham Moss Leisure Centre in Crumpsall. Mr Williams, a delivery driver from Blackley, had seen the parent-and-toddler session being promoted on the council&rsquo;s website and a leaflet.</p>
<p>But when they arrived, reception staff told Mr Williams he could not swim with Darby because it was a women-only session and they would have to come back later. Despite his protests that he had specifically checked the time of the session, the staff were insistent.</p>
<p>It was only when he telephoned the council to complain that he was told the session had been privately booked for Muslim women.</p>
<p>According to Islam, women are forbidden from exposing their bodies to any man but their husband.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Manchester City Council apologised to Mr Williams. He said: &lsquo;We were sorry to hear that he had been turned away. We are ensuring that our website is updated and staff are briefed so this does not happen again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The incident is the latest in a series of rows between local authorities and the public over swimming lessons for ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>In December last year, Croydon Council in South London came under fire for running Muslim-only sessions at one of its leisure centres.</p>
<p>Non-Muslim members of Thornton Heath leisure centre were angry that they could not swim during the Muslim-only sessions on Saturdays and Sundays unless they obeyed the strict dress code.</p>
<p>For men, this involved wearing shorts which kept the navel hidden and were extended below the knee, while women bathers had to wear a swimming costume which covered their body from the neck down to the ankle.</p>
<p>Similarly, Wolverhampton Council and South Lanarkshire local authority have also been criticised for operating women-only swimming for Muslims.</p>
