						<p>The products here are different from those in the West. </p>
<p>The shelves are loaded with creams and lotions which whiten the skin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Making skin look paler is very deeply rooted in Chinese tradition,&rdquo; said Jan Hodok, marketing manager for the skincare company Nivea in China. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Traditionally, the first objective of a woman is to have pale white skin because whitening can cover many flaws. Many Chinese women will put on sun protection just to go next door because they&rsquo;re so afraid of getting any kind of sun rays,&rdquo; he added. </p>
<p>Tanning fashion </p>
<p>Foreign firms like Nivea, Loreal and Estee Lauder make up half of the Chinese face cream market. </p>
<p>With more money in their pockets, young Chinese women &mdash; and some young men too &mdash; are prepared to pay extra for foreign brands. </p>
<p>And foreign attitudes to tanning are also taking hold. </p>
<p>Flicking through the pages of the February edition of Elle magazine, senior beauty editor Helena Hu points to the latest fashion spread. The pages contain a bronzed Chinese woman with a deep tan. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl had just finished her vacation in Thailand so her skin was very, very dark,&rdquo; she explained. </p>
<p>&ldquo;More and more models will tan their skin to make their looks more international; darker skin means healthier body, it&rsquo;s sexier,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Dark skin in Imperial times was associated with labouring in the fields. </p>
<p>Even today it is China&rsquo;s migrant workers, who work on construction sites across cities like Shanghai, that have the darkest skin. </p>
<p>Signs of success </p>
<p>But for a growing number of young Chinese people, dark skin now means having the money to afford foreign holidays or Western-style glamour. </p>
<p>The customers at MH Tanning in central Shanghai agree. The first in China, according to its manager Huang Tong, the salon is popular with the city&rsquo;s young upwardly mobile set. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our customers are mainly Chinese people &mdash; white collar workers, entrepreneurs, people who&rsquo;ve been abroad, or fashionable people like singers and actors. We have more men than women but the girls who come here are really fashion conscious,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>From a few customers a week, the store now has between 20 to 30 customers a day. A tanning session costs between $4 and $25. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hong Kong actor, Gu Tianle has made (tanning) popular. A tan leaves people feeling brighter &mdash; they think it&rsquo;s healthy,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Few people are more fashion conscious than MC, a young advertising executive from Beijing, and regular MH Tanning customer. </p>
<p>His spectacles are by Gucci, he taps away on his laptop, just before he tops up his tan. He says his healthy glow indicates that he is successful. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In other countries a lot of young people like to get sun tans, so it&rsquo;s become very popular here too,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>There is still a great deal of ignorance about the dangers of too much exposure to the sun and there are worries though that this new trend could lead to a higher incidence of skin-cancer. </p>
<p>But few seem particularly concerned about the health effects of tanning. </p>
<p>In Shanghai, getting rich, and displaying your money is what matters. </p>
<p>And a deep dark tan would appear to be one of the easiest ways to show that you are basking in China&rsquo;s new-found wealth. <br>
