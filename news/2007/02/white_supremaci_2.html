<h1><a href="https://www.hfxnews.com/index.cfm?sid=7739&amp;sc=89">White Supremacists Target Protesters</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rachel Boomer, Daily News (Halifax), Feb. 2, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They&rsquo;ve got his home address. His phone number. His picture. There&rsquo;s even a photo of his father.</p>
<p>But Aaron Doncaster says he doesn&rsquo;t believe members of the white supremacist group Stormfront will hurt him, despite the lengths the group has gone to identify him on its website.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a little creepy,&#8221; Doncaster, 31, admitted yesterday.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;s &#8220;not paranoid,&#8221; but takes better note of his surroundings and tries to avoid going out alone after dark. &#8220;I have thought about means of protecting myself, whether I want to acquire a baseball bat. I may get some pepper spray.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doncaster and one of his roommates, who goes by the pseudonym Brad Religion, earned notoriety on Stormfront.org for showing up, masked, to protest self-described &#8220;race realist&#8221; Jared Taylor&rsquo;s appearance in Halifax Jan. 16.</p>
<p>Mark Black, a Halifax freelance writer, is also named on the website as a protester. Protesters physically forced Taylor out of the room without giving him time to speak; Halifax Regional Police are investigating whether that was an assault.</p>
<p>On Jan. 23, a moderator at Stormfront.org who goes by the screen name Odin Patrick began posting photos of Doncaster, Religion and Black, along with e-mail addresses and the address of the home where Doncaster and Religion live.</p>
<p>The photos came from their MySpace.com profiles, which both men have since made private.</p>
<p>A photo of Doncaster&rsquo;s father, Cape Breton politician Ivan Doncaster, was also posted on the site.</p>
<p>Since then, Religion &mdash; who didn&rsquo;t want his last name printed, because Stormfront.org doesn&rsquo;t seem to have it &mdash; says he&rsquo;s gotten several e-mails from a few members of the group, calling him &#8220;vermin&#8221; and suggesting that he learn kung fu or judo, because &#8220;you&rsquo;ll probably need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re not going to scare me. I&rsquo;m going to continue to ignore them,&#8221; Religion said yesterday.</p>
<p>Stormfront.org moderator Jamie Kelso said yesterday the group had no intention of inciting anyone to hurt Doncaster, Religion or Black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our primary concern is freedom of speech. We considered the people who interrupted that appearance to be criminals,&#8221; Kelso told <i>The Daily News</i> yesterday in an interview from West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want anybody to contact these people or take any action against these people. We are completely against anybody who wants to do vigilante justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said posting the photos was an attempt to help police identify the ringleaders of the protest and prosecute them. Address and phone information is acceptable if it&rsquo;s already available online, Kelso said, but he said the photo of Doncaster&rsquo;s father is against Stormfront rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s completely unacceptable. That&rsquo;s way far afield.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doncaster and Religion both dismiss Kelso&rsquo;s explanation, saying the group is trying to intimidate them.</p>
<p>The men said yesterday they&rsquo;ve set up a &#8220;phone tree&#8221; with other activists, so that if they&rsquo;re threatened, others can come to their defence.</p>
