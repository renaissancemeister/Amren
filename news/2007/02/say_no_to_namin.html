						<p>Description/History:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;There is currently a campaign underway to honor a convicted cop-killer from Philadelphia named Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia Police Officer.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;It does a disservice to the citizens of New York City to name a street after an un-repentant murderer.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;The facts of the case are available at <a href="http://www.danielfaulkner.com/" target="faulkner">Justice for Daniel Faulkner.</a></p>
<p><b>Petition:</b></p>
<p>We, the undersigned, call upon the New York City Council to not name any street within the city of New York after Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>
<p>As the convicted murderer of a Philadelphia Police Officer in 1981, Mumia Abu-Jamal is not deserving of such an honor.</p>
<p>To name a street after an imprisoned killer of a civil servant is not only a slap in the face to the law enforcement community, but also the public at large.</p>
<p>Feb 13, 2007 Update-</p>
<p>The speaker of the NYC City Council has commented on the &#8220;Mumia Street&#8221; issue. To see her response go to http://antimove.blogspot.com.</p>

															<h2>A Street Named Mumia</h2>
											<p>
							<i>Daniel Rubin, blogs.philly.com, Jan. 29, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
											<p>There&rsquo;s a movement afoot to rename a street in Harlem to honor Mumia Abu-Jamal, the jailed former Philadelphia freelance radio reporter convicted of the 1981 murder of officer Daniel Faulkner.</p>
<p>A petition went online back in September, and has been slowly attracting support &mdash; 421 signatures so far. The author is named Jeremy Syrop, and his web site is freemumia.com, where one can download posters that trumpet the cause:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is the time for Harlem to name a street after Mumia,&#8221; they read. &#8220;His life is in great danger and a &#8220;Mumia Street&#8221; could help create a momentum to prevent an execution and even win a new trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>A second, identical petition at another online service has garnered 37 signatures.</p>
<p>But if online petitions ruled the day, no one would be living on Mumia Street any time soon.</p>
<p>A third petition is proving to be much more popular &mdash; that would be the anti-Mumia drive. It went up last week, and within 48 hours had nearly 700 signatures. By last count it had 5,155. Tony Allen wrote about it in his anti-Move blog:</p>
<p>Having profaned a street in a suburb of France the pro-Jamal zealots have now decided to repeat their &#8220;success&#8221; here in the United States by having a street in Harlem, New York City, named after the convicted cop-killer.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this goal, the Mumia devotees have started a petition and have even gone so far as to raise money for T.V. commercial spots as a means of bringing attention to their cause.</p>
<p>To name a street after a confirmed killer, cult apologist, and virulent anti-American fanatic like Jamal would be a vile testament to the power of propaganda and an ugly reminder that ignorance has again triumphed over common sense and human decency.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s precedent for naming a street after a &#8220;living revolutionary,&#8221; according to the posters created by the pro-Mumia group. A street outside Paris, in Saint Denis, has been renamed in Abu Jamal&rsquo;s honor. And Nelson Mandela and Joe Dohery of the Irish Republican Army have been so honored in New York City.</p>
<p>The petition reads like this:</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, support the campaign to rename a street in Harlem in honor of internationally renowned political prisoner and death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal:</p>
<p>-because of Mumia&rsquo;s lifelong dedication to his people and to justice, and for never allowing himself to be silenced, even while on death row, and</p>
<p>-because of Mumia&rsquo;s incredible accomplishments, including during the almost 25 years he has spent on death row: five published books and weekly brilliant commentaries exposing the lies that imperialist USA fosters, that are read and listened to by millions around the world, and</p>
<p>-because given the many honors he has received around the world &mdash; including honorary citizenship of Palermo, Venice, the Central District of Copenhagen, and Paris, and a street naming in Saint-Denis, and dozens of university, community, and literary awards, it is befitting that Harlem, too, honor our Brother, and</p>
<p>-because Mumia&rsquo;s case is in its last stages in the court system and, while there is an opportunity for a new and fair trial, the State of Pennsylvania, the Fraternal Order of Police and their allies are opposing that tooth and nail and are demanding, instead, that Mumia be executed, and naming a street in honor of Mumia in Harlem would offer a serious challenge to railroading him to death.</p>
<p>Abu-Jamal was arrested for Faulkner&rsquo;s murder early on Dec. 9, 1981. The 25-year-old officer stopped a Volkswagen on Locust Street driven by Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s brother, William Cook. There was a scuffle. Moments later, the policeman was shot in the back and then between the eyes. Abu-Jamal, 27 at the time, was found sitting on the curb, four feet from the body. He&rsquo;d been shot in the chest. Ballistics testimony at the trial indicated that the bullets fired into officer Faulkner were &#8220;consistent&#8221; with having been fired from the .38-caliber Charter Arms revolver found at the scene. It was registered to Abu Jamal.</p>
<p>He was convicted and sentenced to death a year later by Common Pleas Court Judge Albert F. Sabo, who had presided over more death-penalty convictions than any other judge in America. During his long stay on death row, Abu-Jamal became a cause celebre. He wrote a book, &#8220;Live From Death Row.&#8221; National Public Radio aired his commentaries, before canceling the deal. He attracted famous supporters world wide. Not everyone on the left believe he&rsquo;s the best poster child for the anti-death penalty cause. In 2001 his death sentence was overturned in federal court.</p>
