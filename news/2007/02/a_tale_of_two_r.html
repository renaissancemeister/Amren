<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>There&rsquo;s another accusation of rape floating around Durham this week. The accuser was allegedly attacked at a house party this Saturday.</p>
<p>The accuser is white. The suspect is black.</p>
<p>Heard anything about that? Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>The mainstream media has bent over backward to keep race out of this. Even those who first gave a description of the alleged rapist as a &#8220;black man&#8221; later redacted that from their reports. The News &amp; Observer never printed it at all. And none has pointed out, as the Duke Chronicle has done, that the alleged victim was white, making this a mirror image of the Duke lacrosse case.</p>
<p>Some maintained all along last spring that their protests were not about race but about men&rsquo;s violence against women. Still others tried to fan racial and class tensions by saying that if these were black men accused of raping a white woman, the man would be in jail. Well, now we know two things: it was always about race for the pot bangers and the Group of 88 professors at Duke, and it is demonstrably true, after Sunday&rsquo;s incident, that a black man can be accused of raping a white woman and still be on the street.</p>
<p>It was never about protecting women. I know that because I live in a neighborhood that has the dubious honor of being the namesake of at least one serial rapist. There were few candlelight vigils; there was no national media attention; there were no pot-bangers when the women of my neighborhood couldn&rsquo;t take their dogs for walks at dusk. And, those black-on-white rapes just didn&rsquo;t bring the activist out in people the way the Duke non-rape did.</p>
<p>The News &amp; Observer&rsquo;s omission of race is laughable:</p>
<p>The man is described as being in his late teens or early 20s, about 6-foot-1 and wearing a black do-rag, a gray sweatshirt and blue jeans, according to a police news release.</p>
<p>Why laughable? Because the same story appeared in the Charlotte Observer, written by the same reporter, with &#8220;black&#8221; included, since it was part of the original police report. It was clearly removed in the Raleigh edition:</p>
<p>Police had not charged anyone late Sunday in connection with the allegations but released a description of a suspect: a black male, in his late teens or early 20s, about 6-feet-1-inch tall and wearing a black do-rag, a gray sweat shirt and blue jeans, according to the news release.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duke University administrators will wait for Durham police to finish their investigation of a freshman&rsquo;s allegations that she was raped at an off-campus party before doing an inquiry of their own.</p>
<p>What? Not disbanding the African-American fraternity &mdash; Phi Beta Sigma &mdash; whose members threw the party? I mean, we don&rsquo;t have to wait for anyone to be charged, do we?</p>
