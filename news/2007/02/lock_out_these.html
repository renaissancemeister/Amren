						<p>AUSTRALIA is set to drastically reduce its Sudanese refugee program this year.</p>
<p>With growing community concern about the behaviour of the refugees, Federal Cabinet will soon consider a proposal from Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews to reduce the intake from Horn of Africa nations. </p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s humanitarian program has allowed thousands of Sudanese refugees to come to Australia in recent years. </p>
<p>But there are growing doubts about the wisdom of the decision, especially with the rise of gangs of Sudanese youths and drunk drivers. </p>
<p>There are about 18,000 Sudanese in Victoria, with many traumatised by their experience of civil war &mdash; and the challenge of living in a Western society. </p>
<p>A Sunday Herald Sun survey of 400 cases at magistrates&rsquo; courts across Melbourne found 14 per cent of offenders came from the Horn of Africa and the Middle East &mdash; many of them refugees &mdash; about 20 times the representative proportion of the population. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Australia has one of the most generous humanitarian resettlement programs in the world at 13,000 a year,&rdquo; Mr Andrews said yesterday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But immigration is a process, not an event. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Successful immigration requires integration into the broader community.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A high-profile court case this week highlighted the crime spree of a Sudanese man, Hakeem Hakeem, 21, who raped two teenage girls and an elderly women in a drunken, drug-fuelled episode. He was sentenced to 24 years in jail. </p>
<p>Hakeem had been in Australia for only one month before committing the crimes. </p>
<p>The proposed new policy would focus on settling refugees from the Asia Pacific region. </p>
<p>Sudanese elders believe their community is being unjustly targeted. </p>
<p>The elders yesterday blamed failures in Australian welfare and education systems for crimes in the community. </p>
<p>Jago Adongjak, an educator at the South Eastern Region Migrant Resource Centre and an elder of Melbourne&rsquo;s 7000-strong Sudanese community, said many fellow migrants who had escaped the war-torn nation were facing a different conflict in Australia. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here because there was a war in Sudan and I was a target for the junta,&rdquo; Mr Adongjak said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expecting a peaceful land of opportunity &mdash; and there are opportunities &mdash; but we are also facing a battle here, to survive.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr Adongjak dismissed claims the community did not respect or trust authorities as much as other cultures and had drink-drive issues. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sudanese are not as bad as we are portrayed,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We know because we have just had a meeting with the police and they told us according to their statistics the Sudanese are not anywhere near the worst community for crime in Victoria. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know because I live in the community. </p>
<p>&ldquo;On the issue of drink-driving, I would not say the Sudanese are exceptional either.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The major cause of crime and restlessness in the community was disadvantage, he said. Large families did not receive adequate housing, with several children sharing small rooms. </p>
<p>Children struggled at school because they only had nine months to learn English before being put in classes based on their age, rather than ability. </p>
<p>Parents also found it hard to provide because their professional qualifications were not recognised, so they had to settle for lower-paid jobs, Mr Adongjak said. </p>
