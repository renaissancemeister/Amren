<p>Across the United States, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to get a high-cost, subprime mortgage when buying a home than whites, a major factor in a wave of foreclosures in poor, often black neighborhoods nationwide as a housing slowdown puts millions of &ldquo;subprime&rdquo; borrowers at risk of default.</p>
<p>Even more troubling, real-estate industry analysts say, is an alarming proportion of blacks and Hispanics who received subprime loans by predatory lenders even when their credit picture was good enough to deserve a cheaper loan.</p>
<p>In six major U.S. cities, black borrowers were 3.8 times more likely than whites to receive a higher-cost home loan, and Hispanic borrowers were 3.6 times more likely, according to a study released this month by a group of fair housing agencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blacks and Latinos have lower incomes and less wealth, less steady employment and lower credit ratings, so a completely neutral and fair credit-rating system would still give a higher percentage of subprime loans to minorities,&rdquo; said Jim Campen, a University of Massachusetts economist who contributed to the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the problem is exacerbated by a financial system which isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In greater Boston, 71 percent of blacks earning above $153,000 in 2005 took out mortgages with high interest rates, compared to just 9.4 percent of whites, while about 70 percent of black and Hispanic borrowers with incomes between $92,000 and $152,000 received high-interest rate home loans, compared to 17 percent for whites, according to his research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge disparity,&rdquo; he said. High-cost mortgages usually have interest rates at least 3 percentage points above conventional mortgages.</p>
<p>Predatory lenders</p>
<p>Predatory lenders moved aggressively into the subprime mortgage market as a housing price boom between 2000 and 2005 cut the risk of lending to people with damaged credit ratings.</p>
<p>Many focused on minority neighborhoods in slick sales pitches that offered the American dream: home ownership with no money down and little worry about poor credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The predatory lenders reach out to those who don&rsquo;t really know, people with a lack of education,&rdquo; said Cassandra Hedges, a black 37-year-old mother of two fighting to stave off foreclosure of the Ohio home she bought three years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the first things my broker asked me was &lsquo;How do you know you are ready to buy a house. Have you done any research?&rsquo; We said &lsquo;No&rsquo;. At that point I think he realized &lsquo;Okay I got some people that don&rsquo;t know what the heck they are doing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and her husband Andre now face a 10.75 percent interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage and monthly payments of $1,600 &mdash; more than double the $650 she told her broker she could afford. Foreclosure looms after she missed a payment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re white they overlook the fact that your credit score is a little too low or you have one extra late payment,&rdquo; said Barbara Rice, a community organizer at the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group.</p>
<p>Rice, who is white, and a colleague who is black took part in an experiment in Massachusetts last year to test the racial bias of mortgage brokers. They both posed as prospective home buyers in a separate meetings with several brokers.</p>
<p>Rice presented a worse credit rating and lower income than her black colleague to brokers but received better treatment.</p>
