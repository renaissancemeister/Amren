<h1><a href="http://charlatan.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18515&amp;Itemid=27">Online Groups For White Students Raise Concerns Of Racism At Ryerson</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristen Cucan, The Charlatan (Carleton University, Ottawa), <nobr>March 1,</nobr> 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A steady growth of online groups devoted to white students has triggered a wave of concern from Ryerson University administration and students who worry the groups are fostering racism.</p>
<p>Administration is investigating how university policy could apply to the groups, many of which were created by Ryerson students on the networking website Facebook.</p>
<p>Among the user groups are &#8220;I&rsquo;m a White Minority @ a Toronto University&#8221; with more than 200 members, and &#8220;Equal Rights for Whites&#8221; with more than 150.</p>
<p>With posts such as &#8220;white people unite&#8221; generating uproar and a surge in national media attention, the university is facing a &#8220;sensitive and complicated issue&#8221; in an electronic age where jurisdiction is unclear, said Julia Hanigsberg, general counsel for Ryerson.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re talking to other universities [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] because this is something we&rsquo;re all facing,&#8221; said Hanigsberg. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s unique to this university, and we want to make sure we&rsquo;re dealing with it in the most appropriate way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali Jabbar, the Ryerson Students&rsquo; Union (RSU) president, said the growth of these online groups demonstrates a lack of education about anti-discrimination, and another civil rights movement may be needed to counter intolerance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future looks pretty bleak when things like this are going on, and it just shows there&rsquo;s a lot more work that needs to be done,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jabbar said the union can do nothing about the groups because they exist only in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Although no white culture groups have tried to gain club status on campus, comments online have implied students might try to do so. But they would have a &#8220;very hard time&#8221; trying to prove a white culture exists, said Nora Loreto, RSU vice-president (education).</p>
<p>She says many cultural groups exist for white students, including clubs for Italian and Polish students.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do white students have a group and a place to organize, and do they have a chance to organize on campus? Yes,&#8221; said Loreto. &#8220;Is there such a thing as white culture or have we been approached to form a white culture club? No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevor Morris, a Ryerson student and president of the new Facebook group called &#8220;Ryerson Students Against Race Based Groups,&#8221; said a &#8220;double standard&#8221; against white students is proven by RSU&rsquo;s refusal to grant club status to white culture groups.</p>
<p>This is why he wants to gather support for the removal of all culture clubs if a club for white students is prohibited, he said.</p>
<p>Morris also said the media has &#8220;overreacted&#8221; because nothing racist has been said in any of the groups &mdash; but he said that doesn&rsquo;t mean he agrees with everything that&rsquo;s posted, referring to a comment written by an administrator of &#8220;Equal Rights for Whites,&#8221; that stated, &#8220;white people are Gods [sic] gift to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anybody in any of these groups that actually have any hatred towards anybody,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Morris says that particular comment was probably a joke and it shouldn&rsquo;t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Jabbar said a racism fact sheet and anti-racism training for RSU board members are currently in the works, part of a motion passed last November when the online groups first grabbed attention.</p>
