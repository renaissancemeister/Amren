<h1><a href="http://www.hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?sid=15112&amp;sc=89">Halifax Radio Station Hosts Controversial Debate On Racial Diversity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Patton, Daily News (Halifax), March 6, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A controversial debate on racial diversity went without incident in a small radio studio Tuesday after Saint Mary&rsquo;s University scrubbed the public event over security concerns.</p>
<p>Self-described &lsquo;race realist&rsquo; Jared Taylor and philosophy professor Peter March exchanged views for 90 minutes on a CJCH radio talk show in Halifax.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was delighted to have an opportunity to air my views,&#8221; Taylor told reporters after the debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sorry that we had a little bit in the way of time constraints, but I think I was able to make my basic points, and I believe professor March was able to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>March, who was already scheduled to appear on the program, asked if Taylor could be invited after Saint Mary&rsquo;s announced the debate would not go ahead Tuesday night as planned.</p>
<p>March said later that he hoped to face off against Taylor again.</p>
<p>He said he planned to speak to the vice-president of Saint Mary&rsquo;s about filming a closed debate with Taylor, and inviting the media to attend.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been a very positive experience,&#8221; March said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to confronting other people who hold views that I disagree with, and dealing with them in a rational, fair way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor, who is with <i>American Renaissance</i> magazine in Virginia and advocates the separation of races, was roughed up by protesters in January when he tried to give a speech at a Halifax hotel.</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s event attracted little attention as only two protesters showed up outside the station, carrying placards that read: &lsquo;SMU faculty against racism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host of the show, Rick Howe, warned that he would intervene if he thought the debate was in danger of violating Canada&rsquo;s anti-hate laws.</p>
<p>Before inviting callers to air their views, Howe said he had his own worries about doing the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very nervous about that hour and a half, but I thought that we covered the territory well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We did, indeed, have a good, wide-open debate on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howe said it was important for listeners to make up their own minds on Taylor&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>&#8220;People wonder what all the fuss is about,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is it about this man and his message that prompted the demonstration and the cancellation of his two sessions?&#8221;</p>
<p>March is also no stranger to controversy.</p>
<p>A professor at Saint Mary&rsquo;s, March made headlines a year ago after posting cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad as a terrorist on his office door.</p>
<p>The action triggered protests at the university and March eventually took the cartoons down at the insistence of the school.</p>
<p>Scott Bodnarchuk, general manger of the station, said a seven-second delay was placed on the broadcast as a precaution.</p>
<p>The front doors of the station were locked to prevent any security problems and police were informed that the debate was taking place, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a safe environment &mdash; to hold the debate and let the public give their opinion on the pros and cons of both sides,&#8221; Bodnarchuk said in an interview.</p>
<p>Saint Mary&rsquo;s issued a statement late Monday afternoon saying there was a higher need for security than it could provide for the debate.</p>
<p>The announcement came shortly after a group opposed to the event said it would protest outside the building where the event was to occur on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>University officials said the debate was cancelled after concerns were raised over a posting on an online message board run by self-described white nationalists.</p>
<p>There was a piece on one of the American websites that talked about stabbing &mdash; and sticking someone, Chuck Bridges, vice-president of external affairs, said Monday.</p>
<p>That was the first indication that this might take on a different direction.&#8221;</p>
