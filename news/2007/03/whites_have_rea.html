<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>The heading of Max du Preez&rsquo;s recent column, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t believe everything you read&#8221; (The Star, Opinion and Analysis, March 22 2007) should also be applied to his own views.</p>
<p>White South Africans have every reason to be terrified, given the current breakdown in law and order, as well as President Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s anti-white rhetoric.</p>
<p>French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut said during the Parisian race riots of 2005 that &#8220;the lofty idea of &lsquo;the war on racism&rsquo;&#8221; was gradually turning into a hideously false ideology.</p>
<p>And this anti-racism will be for the 21st century what communism was for the 20th century: a source of violence.</p>
<p>During the Rwandan genocide in 1994, the infamous Radio-TÈlÈvision des Milles Collines broadcast a call to arms to its Hutu listeners by saying &#8220;cut down the tall trees&#8221; and &#8220;kill the cockroaches&#8221;.</p>
<p>We all know what happened next, having seen the sanitised version of the events in the movie Hotel Rwanda.</p>
<p>Mbeki&rsquo;s claims that vast numbers of whites out there call blacks &#8220;kaffirs&#8221; and flatten their noses in racist caricatures are tantamount to anti-white propaganda.</p>
<p>A few months ago I spent a weekend with a foreign TV journalist and his cameraman.</p>
<p>After showing them a collection of newspaper clippings depicting the carnage that took place in December 2006 when every day more white and especially Afrikaner victims were reported murdered, tortured and raped, he soon stopped me, saying: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve seen enough. What your government has done, is to designate you as targets. They don&rsquo;t have to kill you; they know someone else will do it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max du Preez is living in a dream world if he thinks that South Africa has good race relations and that there is no ethnic motive underlying our rampant murder rate.</p>
<p>In Europe, the murder rate is two per 100 000 per year.</p>
<p>In black ghettoes in the US it rises to about 40.</p>
<p>Among Afrikaner farmers it is more than 300 per 100 000 per year!</p>
<p>That single statistic justifies the hypothesis that we are already in the early stages of anti-Afrikaner genocide.</p>
<p>My children recently visited some friends in a rural area.</p>
<p>Upon returning they told me this about their friends&rsquo; mother: &#8220;Auntie A drives with her pistol on her lap and when she sees more than one black man getting closer than 10m from her car, she cocks it and gets very nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was quite shocked by this narration.</p>
<p>But Auntie A is an amiable, intelligent and liberal woman.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I had to admit that she was acting entirely rationally, protecting her children in the car, as well as mine.</p>
<p>Du Preez is also wrong when he claims that black people commit 10 times more violent crime than whites, which would be proportionate to their demographic weight within the total population.</p>
<p>The truth is that they commit 50 to 100 times more violent crime, even though such statistics are not generally available.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, some Afrikaner anthropologists predicted that unbridled urbanisation, coupled with a superficial Western consumerist lifestyle, would not only rob Africans of their soul and unique culture, but also create a nightmare of nihilistic violence in the country.</p>
<p>Bruwer wrote at the time that &#8220;the African is in his deepest being a good person when he moves within the embrace of an own cultural tradition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Today millions of Africans in this country have indeed ceased to be good and we have reason to fear them.</p>
<p>Anyone who pretends otherwise, as Du Preez does, is simply blind to reality.</p>
