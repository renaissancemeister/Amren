<h1>SMU Says No Racism Debate On Campus</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News, March  5, 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An upcoming debate between a Saint Mary&rsquo;s University professor and a self-described &#8220;race realist&#8221; is too risky to hold on campus, administrators say.</p>
<p>The debate between Peter March, a philosophy professor, and Jared Taylor was scheduled to take place at the Halifax university on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Taylor, editor of American Renaissance magazine, opposes immigration, which he says leads to violence and conflict. He also says traits such as intelligence, sexual promiscuity and criminality are linked to race.</p>
<p>In a release Monday, the university said there&rsquo;s a higher level of personal risk and the need for increased security is more than the university can provide.</p>
<p>The school will reimburse March for any related expenses, the university added.</p>
<p>When the debate was announced last month, Saint Mary&rsquo;s University said it wasn&rsquo;t sponsoring the event and March was responsible for all costs, including security and cleanup.</p>
<p>In January, David Divine, Dalhousie University&rsquo;s chairman in black Canadian studies, cancelled a debate on racial diversity after reading up on Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor came to Halifax later that month to make a speech but was disrupted by protesters.</p>

								<h2>Protesters Ponder Giving Taylor Big Kiss-Off</h2>
						<p>
							<i>John Gillis, Halifax Herald, March 5, 2007</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Mixed-race couples kissing, rather than masked hecklers, might greet controversial American speaker Jared Taylor when he visits Halifax next week.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, who calls himself a &#8220;race realist,&#8221; was shouted down and manhandled out of a room he rented when he tried to speak in Halifax in January.</p>
<p>People who oppose his views are planning to protest his appearance at a debate with philosophy professor Peter March at Saint Mary&rsquo;s University on March 7.</p>
<p>But they are considering different methods.</p>
<p>One idea being discussed on the online forum Halifax Locals is to stage an &#8220;interracial make-out party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the key here is to marginalize this man through humour and intelligence &hellip; just go out of our way to reinforce the fact that this guy&rsquo;s anti-intellectual arguments are stupid and his supporters are out of touch with reality,&#8221; one poster writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the makin&rsquo; out begin!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, reached Friday in Oakton, Va., found the idea amusing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they enjoy themselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If they&rsquo;re busily making out, I assume they won&rsquo;t be screaming and beating on pots and pans at the same time, which would be a refreshing change from the last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor said he took that incident as an aberration and doesn&rsquo;t expect a physical confrontation this time.</p>
<p>There will be Halifax Regional Police officers present at the debate and masked people will not be allowed in, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor said he believes in complete freedom of association, including between races, but that integration should not be forced on anyone. He intends to argue Wednesday that racial diversity is a societal weakness that leads to conflict.</p>
<p>To refute that, his opponent Mr. March will have to demonstrate concrete advantages to North American society attributable directly to racial integration, Mr. Taylor said. He suggested that would be a very tall order.</p>
<p>But Mr. March said a physical demonstration of the enjoyment people with different skin colours find in each other, such as the proposed make-out party, would be a striking image to undermine Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be, on the whole, a salutary way of convincing him that we really mean it when we say that we are tolerant up here of multiracial relationships, as he would call them,&#8221; Mr. March said.</p>
<p>He said that in today&rsquo;s visually oriented culture, such a demonstration might be one of the best possible ways to show Mr. Taylor his views are different from those of most Canadians.</p>
<p>Asked if he would consider joining the party, Mr March said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to come with my pockets just full of Viagra.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the potential for things to turn ugly hangs over the event.</p>
<p>After the last incident involving Mr. Taylor, some people who took part in the protest found their names, addresses and phone numbers posted on an American &#8220;white pride&#8221; website.</p>
<p>One of them, Aaron Doncaster, posted on the Halifax forum a copy of an e-mail he said he received from someone threatening to assault him if he disrupts Wednesday&rsquo;s debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we even suspect you of attempting to interrupt Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s speech, I&rsquo;ll cut you so bad and so fast no one will know what happened,&#8221; the message reads in part.</p>
<p>Mr. Doncaster couldn&rsquo;t be reached Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor said he found such a threat upsetting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be distressed if any of those people were attacked by someone who thought he was defending me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The debate is slated to take place in Theatre A of the Burke Education Building on Robie Street at 7 p.m.</p>
