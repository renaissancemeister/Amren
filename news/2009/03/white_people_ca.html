<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brazil&rsquo;s President, while meeting Gordon Brown, has said the global financial crisis was caused by &#8220;white people with blue eyes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made the comments after talks with the Prime Minister to try to forge a global consensus on how to save the worldwide economy.</p>
<p>Sky&rsquo;s Joey Jones said it was a &#8220;rather awkward&#8221; moment for Mr Brown.</p>
<p>&#8220;The President does not mind using fairly flamboyant language. He likes to give extensive answers to journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;But some of it was rather awkward for the Prime Minister, who was standing there listening to the President.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few eyebrows will have gone up at what he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an uncomfortable moment for the Prime Minister and not one he will want repeated at the G20.&#8221;</p>
<p>Downing Street says the remarks were meant for &#8220;domestic consumption&#8221;.</p>

			<p>  I am a white man with blue eyes, and I had nothing to do with the credit crunch. Look at the mess they have in Brazil. What an idiot!</p>

			<p>Actually, it was the blacks in the United States who demanded access to loans and houses they could not afford. The liberals and Bill Clinton gave in and caved in and allowed it to happen. When the payments came due, of course, these blacks couldn&rsquo;t pay and the economy came crashing down. So you can blame &#8220;brown eye&#8221; people, Mr. Silva! </p>

			<p>I agree that white people caused the financial crisis.  Racial pandering white people who handed out affirmative action subprime mortgages like candy, with low interest rates to drive up the selling cost of housing, then various banks, financial institutions and insurance companies trading around the accounts receivable of such mortgages as if they were paper gold   &mdash;   not one of all their financial geniuses and wizards could have forseen that there was something wrong with the whole setup.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t buy the argument that the &#8220;government made us do it.&#8221;  Yeah, they did, but the financial system didn&rsquo;t exactly put up any resisitance to the Community Reinvestment Act.  They did not because they&rsquo;re the same racial panderers that compromise the Federal government.  Anyone who tried to blow the whistle on the fraudulence of it all probably would have been fired for &#8220;racism,&#8221; at the very least their advice unheeded at the top, because of the lust for diversity.</p>

			<p>This Brazilian has no room to talk. His country is so poor that it makes Mexico look like a 1st world country. I&rsquo;ve also read about gangs in Brazil taking over cities for days on end in massive crime sprees. If he wants to point blame he should point to his own countrymen.</p>

			<p>I think you will find that blacks and Hispanics make up a disproportionately large percentage of those who got subprime mortgages and liar loans, and their inability to meet their contractual obligations helped trigger the whole collapse.  This is not to say that there weren&rsquo;t plenty of mortgage brokers, bankers, analysts at ratings agencies, and politicians who were also responsible, some of whom had blue eyes and many of whom did not.  But it takes a hater like da Silva to blame the whole mess on people with blue eyes.</p>

<p>I do, but I am willing to bet that many Whites will still not gain any insight into the awful history of scape-goating Jews.</p>

Belle&rsquo;s comment about how Jews were treated is quite apt.</p>
<p>Da Silva&rsquo;s comment reveals that politics in Brazil is racial, and that the senior levels of the government think using race-based scapegoats will help them win popularity. It is pretty sickening.  And it bodes very badly for the future of Brazil.</p>

			<p>After a long stretch in Latin America I can tell you there is NO reason at all - AT ALL - to ever - EVER - take any - ANY - Political figure from that part of the world seriously - EVER!</p>
<p>They should be rounded up every once in a while and just mocked and riciculed and subjected to endless lectures on exactly why they are so irredeemably, irretrievably, stupid and immoral!</p>
<p>They NEVER made a single decision in their lives without thinking of themselves. And I am not talking about basic self-interest, I am talking about a childish self-absorption.  I am talking about a disgusting and pathetic childishness for which only congenital stupidity, moral corruption, or mental retardation are the possible answers.</p>
<p>With LA Politicians the first two are ALWAYS the reason, though so much so they teeter uneasily toward the third.  They are the essence of Chaos, Corruption, and Confusion. They know and care nothing about Genuine Liberty, Spiritual Growth, and Respect for Others. They are compulsive talkers who never say anything worth listenting to.  The only thing they have to offer is dreary simple-mindedness.  But you would NEVER get that impression from them. They are unrepentant and full of themselves. Hey, does that remind you of a particular demographic from the States, and their political enablers?</p>

			<p>One of Dedalus&rsquo; basic rules ( I should start to number them, just for fun).</p>
<p>No Self-Reflection = Automatic Projection!</p>
<p>What? Do you think the disowned parts of us just - disappear?</p>
<p>No, they go underneath, ie; we bury them.</p>
<p>And they resurface, of course!</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Well, just LISTEN to this A**H**E!</p>
<p>Even this puke knows that brown-eyed people share mightily in the guilt. That is exactly WHY he made that remark.</p>
<p>It is cheap and cheesy deflection/projection Latin American-style.</p>
<p>The one thing we should be grateful to Latin America Idiots for(read the great book by the same title written by three Latin Americans) is providing us with some pathetic and hilarious examples of the very character defects that thrive in abundance here but are harder to see exactly because we&rsquo;re so much smarter (and so, can conceal our dishonesties better). <br>
Whereas the average LAI can&rsquo;t conceal their defects at all.<br>
Only a raving imbecile believes their nonsense.</p>

			<p>I am a woman with blonde hair, fair skin, and blue eyes.  What do you think  has gottem me the greatest amount of discrimination in my life?  It is not for my gender.  I have certainly gotten grief for my appearance, but it is not for my orientation because I look pretty femme.  You know that it is for my Nordic features; don&rsquo;t you?  I don&rsquo;t wear contact lenses, but I have dyed my hair darker to make my life easier.</p>
<p>I am a minority with recessive genes and have been treated with blatant disrepect by &#8220;minority&#8221; patients whose lives I had saved and who were never go to pay for the care they got.  I didn&rsquo;t get into school through Affirmative Action or get special treatment to graduate, but people have no problem assuming that I am less worthy of my credentials than people who didn&rsquo;t have to make it on their own merit.</p>
<p>Given what I experience all the time I am not surprised that blue-eyed people are being blamed for the financial irresponibilities of people with dark race priviliges.      </p>

			<p>Black Insurgent the Brazilian President didn&rsquo;t cushion anything with his bigoted remark.  He just made it more inflammatory.  Even anti-white racism isn&rsquo;t equal opportunity.  I know because  live it every day.</p>
<p>I am looking for a white community to move to as soon as I am eligible for private practice.  I just can&rsquo;t take it anymore.  I can probably get a better deal on housing there too since I won&rsquo;t be expected to pick up the tab for the same kind of &#8220;disadvantaged minorities&#8221; who got free-ride &#8220;minority scholarships&#8221; while I worked for near the minimum wage to get through school and who then blamed &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; when they flunked out the way they think that it is racist of anyone to expect them to pay for the house they still want to own.</p>

			<p>This white-hating miscreant spews racial hatred and another white politician meekly accepts what he says, afraid to counter the insult with facts that prove otherwise and, in fact, reveal the blame to be white leftist radical stupidity for wanting to make an egalitarian society by generously donating taxpayer money to assure that non-whites who can&rsquo;t afford homes get them anyway.</p>
<p>It was, of course, non-whites who caused the global economic meltdown and eventual destruction of societies the world over.  There&rsquo;s no fool who will now disagree with that assessment, because it has been repeatedly and firmly established that such was the case.</p>
<p>But how gutless is Brown to accept such racial slurs without any defense at all?  I mean, the people this offensive-looking moron is talking to are too dimwitted and uneducated to know otherwise and Brown&rsquo;s reluctance to counter the false charge and set the record straight only confirms the lies.</p>
<p>Incidents like these occur all the time, everywhere.  Rush Limbaugh said on his show the other day that he criticized Obama on the air and Charles Barkley warned him during an interview to, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t criticize a brother, Rush,&#8221; with no response to the racist attitutude of Barkley.  Most would expect someone to respond by pointing out that it was a racist statement, because if whites were to say the same thing to a black about Bush, it would be touted as the greatest pro-white bias in recent times.  But he said nothing about the remark.</p>
<p>As whites, we not only lack any kind of leadership, our leaders in politics, the media, academia, etc., are gutless and reveal their gross disunity everytime a racial situation comes up by allowing a non-white to insult us freely with no response.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not only fed up with non-whites, I&rsquo;m fed up with whites, and I&rsquo;m pretty close to deciding on relocating to the remote areas of Idaho where I can bypass the ugly society this evil empire has become.</p>
<p>Not a bad idea really, because I&rsquo;ll avoid the coming chaos as well.</p>

Who packaged these loans into funds and then hedged trillions of <br>
dollars in the form Credit Default Swaps against these funds?</p>
