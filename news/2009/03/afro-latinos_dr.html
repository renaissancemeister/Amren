<h1>Afro-Latinos Draw Hope, Pride From Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Kunerth, Orlando Sentinel, March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s evolving focus on Latin America has special meaning to Latinos in Central Florida  &mdash;  especially Afro-Latinos, who see the American president as the person who can bring the taboo subjects of race and racism out into the open.</p>
<p>In Latin America, Obama is an inspiration for black Hispanics who have been marginalized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Brazil, some black candidates for public office went so far as to change their names to Obama, said Bolivia-born Annabelle Conroy, assistant professor of political science at UCF.</p>
<p>Race has always been viewed differently in Latin America than in the U.S., according to experts. While both share histories of the slave trade, Latin nations didn&rsquo;t have the strict segregation of the U.S.</p>
<p>Some Latin Americans proclaim their countries free of the racism that plagues the U.S. because their populations are composed of mixed races, said Ariel Dulitzky, a professor of law and Latin American studies at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>Some authorities contend the denial of racism among Latin Americans is the negation of their African ancestry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite denials of racial bias, throughout Latin America there is a stigma attached to being black.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Latin America, the whiter you are, the better you are. You don&rsquo;t really want to be black because nothing good is attached to that,&#8221; said Eva Garrick, 35, a black Hispanic from Panama.</p>
<p>She said Obama gives blacks in Latin America reason to acknowledge their own African heritage.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s presidency has Latin Americans rethinking their prejudices and racial biases, even as they regard themselves as less obsessed with race than Americans, experts say.</p>

			<p>Yes, but this sword cuts in two ways.  Once you start focusing on how black a person is, then people are going to realize that there are very strong correlations between blackness and social failure.</p>

			<p>Did we all hear Clinton this evening blaming Mexico&rsquo;s drug and weapon problems on the U.S.?? and vowing to tackle that pesky 2nd amendment and outlaw &#8220;assault&#8221; weapons, which I believe will include auto handguns with high cap mags.</p>

			<p>Obama is a mulatto.  He&rsquo;s half White, and was raised in the White world by Whites.  He has nothing in common with blacks or latinos except nappy hair.  He is, in some respect, a White who can, &#8220;pass for black&#8221;.  Like his White marxist comrades, Obama is intersted in power and control. Blacks and latinos are his clients, not his people.</p>
<p>Black latinos still have bad genes and bad culture.  Americans are not obsessed with race, as the author of this article contends.  Marxists are obsessed with dysfunctional races as it is part of their religion.  Blacks are obsessed with race because it is their race (not racism) that marginalizes them.  Most Whites just want to be left alone.</p>

<p>Drugs are a serious problem, but it&rsquo;s not a problem caused by Everyone in the USA. Only liberal lawbreaking young people like the Clintons who can&rsquo;t keep their minds off dope. </p>

			<p>I live 3 months a year in latino countries. They have a different mindset, one refreshingly different than the US mindset about blacks. They profess no racism, and they practice it, and let anyone rise or fail by thier abilities. No or at least not much AA.  So,,, blacks in Latin America, at least the countries I have lived in dont get very far, and its not because they were held back by the evil whites, but because they are left to thier own abilities. In addition at least in a few (but not all)  latin countries like my beloved Colombia, about once a year they have a &#8220;limpeiza&#8221;. Limpio is the verb for cleaning, and limpeiza is the term used for street cleaning, and we are not talking about washing the roads. A lot of the trash of all colors gets taken off never to return. This happens in Brazil also from time to time. In our USA mindset this is a horrible thing until you think of it like the dog catcher taking a viscious dog off the streets. And it works, beleive it or not I walk in the cities of Colombia far safer than in most large cities in the USA. But back to the blacks. They have all the rights and opportunities allowed all the rest in these countries but always fall to the bottom. And always will!! If we could just let them be equal and not give them prefential treatment nature would take its course in short order.  KF    </p>

<p>I could not agree with you 100% more on this, Kingfish!</p>
<p>As Flamethrower pointed out earlier, this is only a big deal, a fabricated problem, with the Marxistas, who spitefully use and manipulate Blacks wherever they are to be found, here and increasingly in Latin America.<br>

			<p>&#8220;They can now celebrate their own blackness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Blacks are still the low men on the totem pole regarding intelligence, achievement, ability, and creativity, of all the races.  Nothing will ever change that unless they all wind up in one spot again, making comparisons between each other.</p>
<p>Too, after this spending debacle by Obama he&rsquo;s going to be regarded as just another black failure.  Is that something to be proud of?</p>

<p>Funny that you should mention how safe Colombia is.</p>
<p>Colombia has the highest murder rate of any nation on Earth.</p>
<p>The new South Africa is # 2 and Jamaica, that Caribbean paradise, is #3.</p>

			<p>&gt;She said Obama gives blacks in Latin America reason to acknowledge their own African heritage.</p>
<p>Why?  Why are they proud of this heritage?  Africa is a train wreck!  Why do people of African decent always turn towards their so called &#8216;African heritage&rsquo; as a way of feeling better about their failures and their low status?  Does it make them get better jobs?  Does it increase their pay? Do their children start to do school work? Does it earn them greater respect by their white or latino countrymen? No, of course it doesn&rsquo;t.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s ludicrous!</p>
<p>Regarding the so called lack of racism towards blacks in hispanic countries, this too is ludicrous.  American whites seldom say racial things out loud.  The same is true of hispanics.  Besides, even if nothing derogatory is said about blacks in hispanic countries, what do you think is on the minds of hispanics when they witness the low status and lack of achievement of blacks in their counrty?  How could they draw any conclusion other than the fact that blacks are inferior both socially and intellectually?  Even if it is not spoken out in the open, this is the logical conclusion that stares everyone in the face.</p>

			<p>To Soprano,<br>
   I simply dont beleive that Colombia today is the murder capital of the world, iregardless of what is stated in the internet. 99.99999% of americans have never set foot in Colombia and would never even consider doing so based on what we hear in the media. Yes, 15 years ago, during the drug wars COL was the murder and drug capital of the world. Now its the mexicans that have taken over the drug turf. I live in Medellin Colombia 2-3 months a year. In this time I have never seen even so much as a bar fight among locals. I walk at least 5 miles a day going here and there and never have had any unpleasant suprises. I know quite a few americans there that also have not had any problems. What changed COL was in 2002 a new hard right wing president was elected named Uribe and he got tough, real tough on crime and the terrorists. Before 2002 the weak left leaning governments were always appeasing the terrorists, and failing. Plan Colombia, implemented by Bush and Uribe which was I beleive 4 billion in us aid has been an overwhelming success. Of course we wont hear anything of this in our media, they cant say anything good of Bush or any right wing leader. Now COL is our best alli in the region and a very good counter to next door neighbor Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Commie Chavez struts like a peacock and makes big boastful speeches but the Colombian army could easily defeat the Venezuelan army. Uribe is not a braggert like Chavez.  And Col feeds Ven, just cut the food off and that would hurt them bad.  <br>
  Col has 3 major cities, Bogota, the capital with 9 milliom people, the size of NYC more or less, Medellin with roughly 4 million in the metro area, and Cali, smaller but not sure of the population. Once in a great while there is a bombing aimed at a goverment building but basically these cities are safer than most cities in the US, sometimes far safer. The percentage of blacks in these cities is small although the coastal regions of Col have a lot of blacks. Col is a strong capitalist nation with a strong economy. For about 40ish years Col was cut off from the world due to political/terrorist problems and became self sufficient in almost all ways. So now, the people of Col have it good and they know it, they remember the past, and are proud to live in and promulgate a safe and peaceful society. Tourism, which was nonexistent 5 years ago is growing rapidly. Construction cranes are in every direction. There is money galore to be made there, and at least right now the american dollar goes far. I live very good at a fraction of what it would cost to live equally in the US. And its a real viable place to consider living if ever we come to having the type of political problems in the US like thay had for 40 years. On top of everything else Medellin has the best weather in the world, about 72-85 every day of the year with mostly sunny days.  Once again, as one who spends time there I simply do not beleive the data given of Col being the murder capital anymore. You can google in Medellin for more info on what has become known as &#8220;The Medellin Miracle&#8221;  KF             </p>

			<p>To Soprano:</p>
<p>I think what Kingfish meant to say is that when the societies down in LA (Latin America) behave courageously and effectively deal with their criminal element, by any means necessary, the crime rate goes down appreciably, and good people notice and can live accordingly.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we here in the good ol&rsquo; US of A can actually learn a thing or two from them.</p>
<p>Maybe the good people in Campagnia, Calabria and Sicily can observe and understand in dealing with their criminal element also.  </p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon man, read what posters actually write if you wish to dialogue and/or debate.</p>
