<h1>Court to Hear Arguments Over Right to Wear Veil</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timothy Appleby, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Legal arguments in a sexual-assault case that turns on two competing human-rights principles  &mdash;  religious freedom versus defendants&rsquo; right to face their accusers in open court  &mdash;  will be aired next week, a Superior Court judge ruled Monday.</p>
<p>At issue is an application by the Ontario Human Rights Commission for intervenor status in the proceedings against two men accused of sexually attacking a Muslim woman who wants to testify while wearing her niqab, a veil that conceals most of a person&rsquo;s face, leaving only the eyes visible.</p>
<p>The preliminary hearing for the two accused has been on hold since last year, when Mr. Justice Norris Weisman of the Ontario Court ordered the complainant to remove her niqab.</p>
<p>Now, the human rights commission is contending that the judge made a legal error, and is seeking status to make that argument in court, a unusual twist in a criminal proceeding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Similar tussles have taken place elsewhere in the world, including Britain and New Zealand, but in Canada this appears to be the first case of its kind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s case law (suggesting) that you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to see the witness&rsquo;s face in order to properly assess credibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s lawyer, David Butt, acknowledged that the two principles are in conflict.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As routinely happens where sexual assault is alleged, her identity is shielded by a court order. So too is the evidence that has surfaced so far in the preliminary hearing, including the identities of the two defendants.</p>

			<p>&#8220;two competing Human Rights principles&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Unless God  himself is cross examining the witness,(and can relate What is in their mind to the jury) then we need to see the face of the accuser, to judge for ourselves their veracity as exibited by facial expressions.</p>

			<p>Forgot to mention a friend and I  had an argument about whether children on the witness stand  should be shielded from the &#8220;trauma&#8221; of having to face the defendant. I was for the position of having them be in court instead of having an off site deposition recorded to be played in court. My friend asked, &#8220;Even a six year old child that had been abused?!?&#8221; My answer was &#8220;ESPECIALLY A SIX YEAR OLD CHILD!!!&#8221; The rights of children to  not be made uncomfortable must be subordinated to the legal rights of adults facing prision terms&hellip;</p>

			<p>I hope the court finds for the defendants here.  A woman&rsquo;s right to cover up her face ends when she accuses someone of a crime for which they could receive prison time.</p>

			<p>In THIS particular case (a sexual assault) I can see why she would want to conceal her face from her assailants.  It would be difficult enough for her to appear in court to face them at all.</p>

			<p>hi AmRen it&rsquo;s me the Korean guy in Toronto and I am going to babble for a couple of minutes!! </p>
<p>There is something I have learned only from AmRen, but never heard of in the past since I came to Canada until I read it and eventually learned what it is on AmRen.</p>
<p>A foodstamp!!</p>
<p>I have never seen it or heard of it in Canada since the day my family immigrated here.  </p>
<p>I read &#8220;foodstamp&#8221; a few times on AmRen, and thought to myself, &#8220;I have never seen it or heard of it before.  What is a foodstamp?  What is a foodstamp?  And why do some supermarkets in Charlotte want to have &#8220;no foodstamps&#8221; policy posted in front of their entrances?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I finally figured out what a foodstamp would be in my head!! only very recently.</p>
<p>it is something we can use to exchange for food?  </p>
<p>and it is issued by the government?</p>
<p>In Canada, the less fortunate people and permanently handicapped people still receive welfare assistance in terms of cash.  The government sends monthly cheques or makes direct deposits to the receivers&rsquo; bank accounts.</p>
<p>And within the next 48 hours, I also solved the questions regarding why the government issues foodstamps instead of just sending cash, and why some supermarkets in Charlotte want to have &#8220;no foodstamps&#8221; signs posted on their entrances.  First, the reason that the government issues foodstamps is so the receivers cannot use the welfare assistance for any other purpose, and next, the reason some supermarkets have &#8220;no foodstamps&#8221; signs is because if the supermarket has to deal with too many people bringing in foodstamps, the supermarket might get disrupted.  </p>
<p>I searched around the internet for a minute and found this picture and thought the rest of AmRen members might find this picture interesting as well.</p>

<p>I am spending a portion of my life teaching children nowadays&hellip;  it is a great honour and pleasure, my children are very beautiful, cute and hilarious, but it is also very demanding, mentally and physically.  The actual teaching in front of the students is, I would say, about 50% of what teachers have to do.  I started teaching even before I wrote my final exams, (it was indeed very challenging to concentrate on my own academics and concentrate on teaching at the same time) and since I wrote my final exam, I just concentrated on teaching wholly and my final GPA was completely out of my mind.  I finally found out my GPA a few days ago (it has been more than a month since I wrote my final exam) and it was what I wished my GPA to be, but felt was going to be a stretch, and I was very grateful.  I wrote a thank-you email to my professor and gave her a picture of my family&rsquo;s puppy as a present.  </p>

			<p>I believe if this woman wants to wear the veil, she should go to Saudi. The women MUST act like muslim women then, they have no other choice.</p>

			<p>It is  very painful for the victim of a sex crime to have to face her assailant(s) at all, and I believe that many such victims choose not to go through that ordeal. It&rsquo;s a second humiliation for them. And it&rsquo;s very intimidating. Anyone who&rsquo;s been through it can understand. Those who haven&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why she should have to bare her face to them as well.  Her verbal testimony should be enough to prove the truth or falsity of the crime committed.  Why force her, the victim, to have to sit there with them smirking or glaring at her throuout her testimony?  It&rsquo;s putting her trhough the indignity twice. This would be expecially true for a woman who is not used to baring her face to strange men.  To a Moslim woman it is like being stripped naked in public.</p>

			<p>It  seems to me that a defendant already knows who he assaulted if he&rsquo;s guilty. So there&rsquo;s no reason for the accuser not to show their face. If the defendant is innocent, he deserves to know who tried to frame him.</p>

			<p>I say make her take off her veil. In Chicago, Iranians protesting with face masks were made to take off their masks after the Democrats passed a law stating it was illegal to protest in public with your face covered. This was upheld by the courts. There apparently was no &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; upon protestors. So, as long as we are afflicted with these laws, you might as well make the  Islamics misarble enough to leave the country.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to make light of this, especially if you have experienced it, but this is how the Western justice system works.  The article doesn&rsquo;t mention whether there is any hard evidence, and if this is a &#8220;he said&#8221;/&#8221;she said&#8221; case then the jury must have the best possible opportunity to determine the validity of her story.  By calling her &#8220;the victim&#8221; you are presuming the man&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see why she should have to bare her face to them as well. Her verbal testimony should be enough to prove the truth or falsity of the crime committed. Why force her, the victim, to have to sit there with them smirking or glaring at her throuout her testimony? It&rsquo;s putting her trhough the indignity twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The burden of proof in this case is on the woman and the state.  We cannot deny the man his rights because of his accuser&rsquo;s discomfort.  Every day in this country we expect witnesses to open themselves up to retaliation in the name of justice.  I know you think that I just &#8220;can&rsquo;t understand&#8221;, but from an objective viewpoint it seems that one person&rsquo;s temporary discomfort is outweighed by the possibility of an innocent person doing a long term in a savage prison and living the rest of their life with the sex offender tag.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be expecially true for a woman who is not used to baring her face to strange men. To a Moslim woman it is like being stripped naked in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>If she wants to abide by Muslim cultural norms, she should live in a Muslim nation.  In Canada, she will (hopefully) be treated as a Canadian.  If they ignore the rules of their legal system to accommodate her religion, should they also absolve a Muslim man who kills his adulterous wife?  If she is living in Canada, and enjoying all the benefits thereof, she must adapt to Canadian society, not the other way around.</p>

			<p>The accuser is still free to lie through her teeth with her face unveiled.  The FBI agent assigned to my case repeatedly committed open perjury, and was brazen enough about it years after my release to call out to me at Lowe&rsquo;s, while I was shopping for a new garage door opening mechanism.</p>
<p>The Koran does not require a woman to either cover her hair or her face.  It merely admonishes them to &#8220;dress modestly&#8221;.</p>

			<p>If you had ever been falsely accused of doing something in your life, believe me, you would have a lot less sympathy here for this woman. The fact is you have a RIGHT to face your accuser. </p>

<p>So then, you&rsquo;re saying it makes no difference?<br>
Then why should it matter?<br>

<p>Does having someone&rsquo;s face uncovered mean that she or he cannot lie? <br>
And why would you assume that SHE is the culprit, instead of her attackers?<br>
I have been fasely accused of things (as I&rsquo;m sure we all have been) and the liar was just as able to lie perfectly well with his face fully uncovered. It didn&rsquo;t force the truth to come out.</p>
<p>Many women, moslem or not, avoid going to court, precisely because of the further pain and humiliation it will cause them.  And  you are assuming  that SHE is the liar and treating her like  the culprit, not the victim!!! </p>
<p>If she were not a moslem but a white woman attacked by several black men, would you be making the same assumption &hellip;  that she must be lying?  I doubt it. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very obvious that what&rsquo;s going here is just anti-moslem bias. (And I&rsquo;m not even moslem, btw,  just fair.)</p>

			<p>I do agree that most on here are treating the woman as if she were a liar. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t believe in muslim immigration and if they are here, they should abide by our rules. I also realize the burden of proof is on the state. However, a person can lie regardless of whether he/she faces his/her accuser as someone else said and it is very painful for a child to face an adult or a woman to face her rapist. Yes, on occasion people can make false accusations in any crime be it rape or theft or whatever. However, most women aren&rsquo;t lying.</p>

			<p>I agree too that Moslem immigration is a bad and dangerous idea; and that if they are here anyway they &#8220;should abide by our rules&#8221;. But it&rsquo;s also obvious that most people here are automatically assuming that since she&rsquo;s a Moslem, she&rsquo;s a lair. That&rsquo;s wrong and uncompassionate. She is, after all, the victim in this case. Victims of sex crimes are ordinarily extended every consideration. (I don&rsquo;t know if this should extend to covering her face, but does it even matter?)</p>
<p>And who were her attackers? (in the plural, do take note!) I&rsquo;m very doubtful that they were white men. Or at least non-Moslems. Not likely!  So why give them the benefit of the doubt that she must be lying?   </p>
<p>Yes, women can lie. But most don&rsquo;t. Going to court is enough of an ordeal.</p>

<p>You misrepresented what I said, partly by cutting of some of my post. I do not &#8220;assume&#8221; anything. I simply honestly and sincerely believe that you have a RIGHT to face your accuser.</p>

			<p> <i>I do not &ldquo;assume&rdquo; anything. I simply honestly and sincerely believe that you have a RIGHT to face your accuser.</i></p>
<p>#1. You are strongly implying that she is lying, that her story is dubious, and that she is not to be believed.</p>
<p>#2. Yes, she <i><b>is </b></i> facing her accuser! [That was never the issue.]   But is it necessary to her to <b><i>expose her face</i></b> to him as well?  THAT is the issue in this matter&hellip; the ONLY issue.</p>
<p>You are deliberately confusing the issues by bringing in the  &#8220;right to face one&rsquo;s accuser&#8221; - which was never a factor in this case. It was never questioned or in dispute from the beginning.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have the right to strip your accuser naked and force her to stand there before you in public. To a devout moslem woman like her, that is what this amounts to. It&rsquo;s intimidatating, and it&rsquo;s a further humiliation in addition to what she already went through.</p>
<p>In EITHER case, she would still be &#8220;facing her accuser&#8221;&hellip; which is all the law requires. That has been complied with.</p>
<p>I left that part out of the original quote because it is irrelevant here   &mdash;  since that requirement is already being met. Facing one&rsquo;s accuser is not the issue.  It&rsquo;s about baring forbidden parts of the body. It&rsquo;s about violating someone&rsquo;s sense of modesty.</p>
<p>Yes, people above will say that some moslem women wear bikinis and all of that. And I can agree with them. This will vary from country to country, and even family to family.  But in THIS case, we&rsquo;re taking about THIS woman&rsquo;s concept of  what is proper modesty.</p>
<p>At the bottom line, there is an obvious cultural conflict here. This is why I believe it is best not to intermix radically different cultures, as this will only produce serious social problems. And legal problems   &mdash;   this being a good example. The advocates of diversity may think otherwise, but I disagree. Diversity brings more trouble than it brings benefits.</p>

			<p>If this woman is allowed to testify while veiled, I hope the jurors in the case are all also allowed to wear paper bags with eye-holes cut in them over their heads.  </p>
<p>A part of this problem that has not been mentioned heretofore is that if the case proceeds with this alleged &#8220;victim&#8221; allowed to hide herself, any decent lawyer is going to beat the conviction on appeal.</p>
<p>Does the &#8220;victim&#8221; claim to be a good Muslim?  If so, she should submit to the usual &#8220;honor killing&#8221; by her male relatives for having disgraced her family by being raped.</p>

			<p>&#8220;#2. Yes, she is facing her accuser!&#8221; <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
That was a mistake.  She is not facing her &#8220;accuser&#8221; but her attacker. They were the attackers, in fact. Plural!  She is the victim and the one who is the accuser.</p>
<p>You have put her so much in doubt that you&rsquo;ve made it look like she is the one who&rsquo;s being accused.</p>
