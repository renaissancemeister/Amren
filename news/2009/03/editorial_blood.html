<h1>Bloody Mass Murder Stems From Drug Trade</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Record (Greensboro, North Carolina), March 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A mass murder in a small North Carolina town turned into a modern morality play as facts emerged this week.</p>
<p>Authorities have determined that drug trafficking was behind the slaughter of four members of a Conover family March 12.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Brian Tzeo has not been charged with any crime, the Catawba County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office says he admitted his role in a drug-smuggling ring, receiving opium mailed from Thailand. Tzeo wasn&rsquo;t home when authorities say an associate, Chiew Chan Saevang, went to his house to steal opium and killed Tzeo&rsquo;s wife and three children.</p>
<p>Events took another bizarre turn Wednesday. Saevang and his girlfriend, Yer Yang, also an alleged member of the drug ring, crashed their car in Utah during a pursuit and died by murder-suicide, the Washington County, Utah, Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said.</p>
<p>Theirs were the fifth and sixth deaths in this horrific affair.</p>
<p>Neighbors of the Tzeo family and members of the area&rsquo;s Southeast Asian immigrant communities expressed shock, both at the crime itself and at the alleged drug connection. Tzeo and his wife came to the United States from Laos in the 1980s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Catawba County Sheriff David Huffman said opium or heroin, which is made from opium, worth $160,000 to $200,000 was stolen from the Tzeo house. Some people are willing to kill for that much money  &mdash;  willing to kill even a 4-year-old boy, who was the youngest victim of this crime.</p>

			<p>We can blame this square on the liberals. The solution to the drug problems lies in liberals hands, just like they say it does. Just by not using illegal drugs they can stop the problem. As much as I&rsquo;d like to blame liberals&hellip; we seem to have more and more drug use as more and more people of color live in America. Drug use is higher than ever. Non-whites use drugs in order to have fun or recreation. Whites are doped up on ever more Prozac and Ritalin in order to deal with non-whites. </p>

			<p>I saw a lot of news coverage of this.  I assumed the slaughtered family was white because all the neighbors were white.  The news casters did everything to hide the fact that the slaughtered drug dealers were Asian.</p>

<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t believe all the liberal propaganda you read about the &#8220;horrors of psychotrophic drugs.  Liberal con artists prefer the talk for years therapy that never works (analysis).</p>
<p>Real physicians who want to heal the mentally ill, especially those afflicted with the very common disorders of depression and mild personality disorders prescribe drugs like prozac.  Prozac and other psychotrophic drugs elevate serontin levels.</p>
<p>Elevating serotin levels to normal cures depression and personality disorders, just as keeping glucose and insulin levels at normal levels takes care of diabetes and keeping blood pressure at normal levels stops heart and other problems.</p>
<p>Again, most of the diatribes about the &#8220;abuse of phsychotrophic drugs&#8221; comes from the freudian analyst con artists who would rather sit in their offices doing nothing all day instead of practicing medicine and curing their patients.</p>

			<p>I thought that Whites were doped up on Prozac and Ritalin in order to make their dispossession bearable.</p>
