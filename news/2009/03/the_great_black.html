<h1>The Great Black Hope</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barry Latzer, Claremont Institute, March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The decline in crime between 1994 and 2000 may have been the greatest in American history. Not only was the drop pronounced, it was nationwide and embraced all serious crime categories. Between 1990 and 2000, the nationwide murder rate  &mdash;  one of the most accurate crime indicators  &mdash;  fell 41%. And the federal government&rsquo;s crime victim survey revealed over the same decade a 38% drop in nonfatal violent crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Oddly, despite all of the effort to study crime when it was soaring, from the late 1960s through the early &rsquo;90s, the great crime decline caught the experts by surprise. Not only did they fail to predict it, but even now they cannot quite explain it.</p>
<p>A big reason for this inability is the academy&rsquo;s refusal to deal candidly with questions of race. Although African-Americans are disproportionately involved in violent crimes, non-academics will no doubt be amazed to learn that few criminologists analyze in a frank, straightforward manner the role of African-Americans in crime. For instance, Berkeley criminologist Franklin Zimring&rsquo;s The Great American Crime Decline (2007) barely discusses race and does not even have an index entry for blacks or any other racial category. Zimring is not atypical, and the failure to examine or even identify the race factor is not accidental. Now that crime has declined and African-Americans are leading the downturn, perhaps we have an opportunity to present a more honest analysis of America&rsquo;s crime situation.</p>
<p><b>Police and Prisons</b></p>
<p>One might expect that the country&rsquo;s response to high crime  &mdash;  more police and stiffer sentences  &mdash;  would explain the crime fall. But the evidence is equivocal. {snip}</p>
<p>The trouble with all of these analyses is that they may be measuring incapacitation, not deterrence. It is difficult to distinguish the effect on crime rates of removing from circulation offenders with a propensity to recidivate (i.e., incapacitation) and the impact of frightening into law-abidingness potential offenders who remain at large (deterrence).</p>
<p>We must also examine the role of the police. As crime fell in the 1990s the number of police officers in big cities increased 17%. On the basis of sheer numbers alone, one would expect greater police effectiveness. But numbers were only part of the story. There were notable improvements in the quality of police administration, with better measures of performance through Compstat (which incorporates computerized crime-mapping) and more aggressive patrols based on the Broken Windows (or community disorder) theory of policing developed by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George Kelling. And indeed, handgun checks, quality-of-life enforcement, and increased misdemeanor arrests seem to have made a real difference in both maintaining order and reducing violence.</p>
<p>For all the advances in police work, however, efficiency in arrests did not improve. The percent of homicides cleared by arrest went up a bit during the crime decline years, but never attained the 75% rates achieved in the 1970s. Since homicide clearances represent the best in police performance  &mdash;  the arrest rates for all other crimes are lower  &mdash;  one would have to credit the police for curbing violent crime by arresting a smaller proportion of violent criminals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is another reason to be skeptical that better policing was the central ingredient in the crime drop. The decline in crime was a nationwide phenomenon within a narrow time-frame. Yet policing is a local function in the United States. How could it be that so many locally run police departments got so smart so fast? In fact, some departments  &mdash;  Seattle&rsquo;s, for example  &mdash;  candidly admitted that they were baffled by the crime reductions in their cities. And whatever accounts for New York City&rsquo;s remarkable success in controlling crime  &mdash;  and then-Police Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani deserve a lot of credit for increasing the size and efficiency of the NYPD  &mdash;  New York&rsquo;s achievement cannot explain the 51% violent crime drop in San Francisco or the 59% decline in Fort Worth.</p>
<p><b>Crime and Race</b></p>
<p>But there is indeed a factor that explains, or more accurately, begins to explain the crime fall: namely, race. The data on the relationship of race and crime, as I will show, speak volumes. Moreover, by closely analyzing the African-American role in crime we begin to discover other compelling explanations for its rise and fall.</p>
<p>Simply put, the decline in crime, especially in violent crime, was and is being driven by major reductions in offenses by African-American males. Black violent crime, which had been persistently high for over three decades (indeed, for a long time before that), began unexpectedly to nosedive in the mid-1990s. Since 2000 it has plateaued, but there are reasons to be optimistic about further declines.</p>
<p>Consider first our most accurate data: murder victims. Between 1990 and 2000, when the nationwide homicide rate dropped 41%, black homicide victimization fell 45%. Since crime is overwhelmingly intraracial  &mdash;  that is, blacks usually kill blacks and whites kill whites  &mdash;  the decline in murders of African-Americans is a good indicator of a falloff in murder by African-Americans. This is confirmed by a 45% drop in black homicide offending between 1990 and 2000. (Perpetrator data are less reliable than, but are corroborated by, victim data.) For whites, whose rates were seven to ten times lower to begin with, the decline (37.5%) was less dramatic, as Chart A shows.</p>
<p>The results are comparable with respect to other crimes of violence, namely rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. From 1990 to 2000 non-homicidal violent crime declined 38%. Black violent victimizations over the same time period were cut in half (-49%). Once again, the decline in victimizations was mirrored in the figures for black offending. Arrest rates of African-Americans for violent crimes other than murder dropped 53%. (For whites, the decline was 21%.)</p>
<p>{snip} In 2005, for instance, African-Americans, who are around 12% of the U.S. population, were responsible for 55% of the murders in the United States, and their murder commission rate was nearly eight times that of whites. While the black crime problem is not solved, we may be seeing the beginning of a major long-term downward trend.</p>
<p>The unresolved question, of course, is why did black violent crime diminish at all? And why did it fall so much more than white crime? This is the real murder mystery. To solve it we must address black crime specifically.</p>
<p><b>Geographic Mobility</b></p>
<p>A part of the decline in black crime may well have been caused by simple mobility: blacks have moved away from some of the most troubled and crime-ridden big cities. {snip} In the &rsquo;90s {snip} North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida saw the biggest growth in their black populations; New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, the biggest declines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not all of the new black mobility was voluntary. Another piece of the puzzle is that some of the most crime-prone blacks were &#8220;taken off the streets.&#8221; Justice Department figures indicate that from 1990 to 2000 the total number of sentenced inmates in the United States rose 77%, and by 2000 nearly 10% of young black men were in prison. The comparable white imprisonment rate was 1%.</p>
<p>Despite geographic mobility and incarceration, urban, black, lower-class young men  &mdash;  the most crime-prone population  &mdash;  did not decline nationwide. In fact, the black male population between the ages of 15 and 29 rose 2% between 1990 and 2000. A more telling measure than the national total, however, is the young black male population of the nation&rsquo;s big cities, the breeding ground for violent crime.</p>
<p>The urban population figures lend qualified support to the black mobility explanation. During the &rsquo;90s, crime fell in eight of America&rsquo;s ten biggest cities, and in seven of the eight the young black male population (ages 15-29) also declined. In only one city, Philadelphia, did that key population go down while violent crime increased. {snip}</p>
<p>Significantly, however, in not one of the crime-drop cities did the decline in black male population keep pace with the reduction in crime. This is dramatically borne out by New York City, where violent crime fell 60% while the young black male population shrank 15%.</p>
<p>Thus, black population decline, cannot, by itself, explain the magnitude of the crime drop that occurred between 1994 and 2000.</p>
<p><b>Social Mobility</b></p>
<p>Another possible explanation is social mobility. Many of the poor, black, high-crime neighborhoods are becoming less poor and less high-crime, while remaining just as black. In the North Kenwood-Oakland area of Chicago, for instance, the proportion of impoverished families went from 63% in 1990 to 39% by 2000. Yet the area remained around 98% black. We see a similar pattern in New York&rsquo;s Harlem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than any other development, the growing African-American middle class bodes well for the nation&rsquo;s future because middle-class people, whatever their color, don&rsquo;t commit a lot of violent crime. But it does not explain the crime drop of the 1990s. We know this because crime fell dramatically in poor black districts even though they remained both poor and black.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, I examined crime in five New York City police precincts with over 80% black population and high poverty, including Harlem and Brooklyn&rsquo;s Bedford-Stuyvesant. Each had staggering homicide rates in 1990: from two to four times the rate for the city overall. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I found comparable results in Chicago, where the seven police districts with overwhelmingly black populations (above 90%) generated half the city&rsquo;s murders. During the great fall in crime between 1990 and 2000, however, murders in Chicago fell by 26%, and more than half of that decline occurred in the seven black districts. In Chicago as in New York, it was the black communities, evidently poor, that led the downturn in violent crime. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Intergenerational Change</b></p>
<p>The most plausible explanation for the crime decline is that it was caused by cultural change across generations, principally among African-Americans. In particular, the 1980s gave birth to a generation of African-Americans who increasingly rejected the culture of crime, and in some cases are mainstreaming into the middle class. Simply stated, these young black males saw the effects of drugs and crime on the adults in their communities and resolved that they did not want to spend their lives in prison or as junkies, or die prematurely from AIDS or murder. One might call this an intergenerational deterrent effect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Surveys, such as those made of arrested violent felons, all indicate that the most crime-prone years are ages 15-34 (15-24 for murderers). The second generation of migrated blacks  &mdash;  the black baby boomers, if you will  &mdash;  reached their most crime-active years in the mid-1960s and continued their criminal activity at extraordinarily high levels through the &rsquo;70s. In the 1980s, the early cohort, born immediately after the war, reached their late 30s and started &#8220;aging out&#8221; of crime. As a result, murder rates began to decline. This mini-crime drop was short-lived, however; in the mid-1980s murder rates again turned sharply upward as the third, or &#8220;echo boomer&#8221; generation, having reached its late teens, took over crime production. Spurred by crack cocaine and the widespread availability of illegal handguns, these grandchildren of Southern migrants were responsible for the massive crime surge of the late &rsquo;80s. What happened next, however, stunned the experts. In 1995, just when another generation, the late echo boomers, was expected to reach its peak years for murder and violent crime, crime plummeted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The crime fall years were marked by steadily decreasing proportions of murders by blacks. In other words, while the murder pie shrank during the late &rsquo;90s  &mdash;  the total murders by all races declined  &mdash;  the black portion of the pie eroded the most. The reduction in murders by black males, especially by younger males (14-24), was largely responsible for the nation&rsquo;s overall homicide decline from 1994-2000.</p>
<p><b>Crime and Culture</b></p>
<p>Experts have been baffled by the crime problem because they focus on social conditions  &mdash;  poverty, unemployment, housing, segregation, etc.  &mdash;  while assuming that any group living in conditions similar to these of the black lower class would have the same response, namely, violent crime. But this turns a blind eye to different groups&rsquo; varying reactions to social circumstances. Groups develop distinctive ways of viewing the world and acting in it  &mdash;  unique cultures, or if they are part of a larger social collective, subcultures. Only through a study of a group&rsquo;s history can we understand the genesis and character of its culture.</p>
<p>The relationship between black violence and the troubling history of African-Americans  &mdash;  a chronicle of slavery, discrimination, poverty, and segregation  &mdash;  remains insufficiently examined. With the exception of slavery, all immigrant groups suffered these social ills, some in greater measure than blacks, but few committed violent crime at anything near the rates of African-Americans, and none over the course of an entire century. As for slavery, it ended 100 years before the black crime rise of the 1960s and cannot be a direct causal factor. What&rsquo;s more, American blacks from the Caribbean, despite a history of slavery and the same skin color disadvantages as African-Americans, have had much lower crime rates. Nor has it been explained why poverty, racism, and the like should have caused violent crime, as opposed to the nonviolent (property crime) variety that typifies economic adversity.</p>
<p>The roots of contemporary black violence may be found in the immediate post-slavery history of African-Americans. When they were slaves blacks were nonviolent; their crimes mainly were petty theft. It is, ironically, in the decades after emancipation that the freedmen, set adrift in the social turmoil of the 19th-century South, turned to violence. When impoverished African-Americans first migrated into Southern cities after Emancipation they were illiterate and unskilled and had few opportunities for social and economic betterment. It was then that young black men developed what historian Joel Williamson called the &#8220;street-corner, pool-hall hustling, and petty criminal way of life.&#8221; The children of these freedmen, the first generation after slavery, knew only poverty, turmoil and brutality  &mdash;  Ku Klux Klan terrorism, pogrom-like riots, and economic depressions. It was this generation that, in the 1890s, turned to violence, largely directed at other blacks. Such transgressions, unlike crimes against whites (which invited lynching) frequently were ignored, and thereby encouraged by the authorities. This was the origin of the black subculture of violence.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, as poor African-Americans migrated north in search of a better life, they brought with them this criminal subculture. {snip}</p>
<p>This black lower-class culture of violence remains the best explanation for black crime, and in large measure, for America&rsquo;s crime story since World War II. Fortunately, and contrary to racist dogmas, culture is not immutable. It responds to social experiences. It changes over time and across generations. And it is the change in the black subculture  &mdash;  a change that developed in the sons and daughters of the black baby boomers and continues today  &mdash;  that best explains the great crime decline.</p>
<p><b>A New Generation</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The abandonment of hard drugs by a new generation of African-Americans, a generation raised by drug abusers and exposed to the worst of urban slum life, is itself a remarkable story. A multi-year study of over 13,000 arrested persons in New York City, overwhelmingly black and Puerto Rican, demonstrated the dramatic change in drug use. The Justice Department funded the interviewing and urine sampling of Manhattan arrestees from 1987-97. Researchers thus were able to determine the proportion of offenders who were using drugs, and as significantly, the types of drugs they used and the ages of the users. The heroin injectors, it turns out, were born between 1945 and 1954. Arrestees born between 1955 and 1969, had turned to a new and more dangerous narcotic  &mdash;  &#8220;crack&#8221; cocaine  &mdash;  which, when heated in vials, produces a rapid and intense euphoria. By the mid-&rsquo;80s, crack was all the rage, wiping out the mini-crime drop at the onset of that decade. Crack users repeatedly robbed to support their cravings, which recurred many times each day, as the cocaine high was rapidly and continually followed by a severe dysphoria. The most violent crimes  &mdash;  murder and aggravated assaults  &mdash;  were committed by the crack dealers and their enforcers. Crack helped drive to new heights murder and mayhem in our cities.</p>
<p>Then something quite surprising occurred. Among arrestees born in the late &rsquo;60s and early &rsquo;70s, crack cocaine use fell off dramatically. Nearly half of those arrestees who had been born in 1969 had used crack; that figure plummeted to 20% for those born in 1972. What&rsquo;s more, the rejection of crack &#8220;stuck&#8221; with subsequent cohorts of adolescents. The primary reason, researchers found, was<blockquote>the negative role models in their lives. They clearly do not want to emulate their parents, older siblings, close relatives, or acquaintances who were ensnared by crack or heroin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]t is the ravages that befell the HeroinGen and CrackGen that led them to avoid hard drugs. Those ravages include both deteriorating health as well as increased encounters with police and long prison terms. Thus, stepped up policing efforts may have hastened the transformation of the inner-city subcultures of drug use.<br>
</blockquote><br>
This new generation of African-Americans, fearing imprisonment, addiction, illness, and death, repudiated the worst of the drug menace. It was fear, the essence of deterrence, that changed the culture. And it was the same fear-borne intergenerational cultural change that would drive down crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Curtis [Richard Curtis] is describing a poor Hispanic neighborhood, there is every reason to believe that similar events were occurring in black communities as well. There, not only did crime drop, but other social indicators point to significant positive change. Consider these changes in black youth during the 1990s, the period of the big crime drop:</p>
<p>    * Regular church attendance by black 12th graders rose 22%.</p>
<p>    * Pregnancy rates for black teens fell by nearly one-third.</p>
<p>    * The number of black high school students who reported carrying weapons fell 52%.</p>
<p>    * By 2003, more than three times as many white as black 12th graders reported using hard drugs.</p>
<p>    * Between 1991 and 2000, the number of 12th graders reporting use of alcohol, cigarettes, or illicit drugs in the previous 30 days fell by 19% for blacks, 20% for whites.</p>
<p>    * From 1997 to 2003, the rate of placement of male juveniles in residences, overwhelmingly because of juvenile delinquency, fell 24% for blacks, 5% for whites.</p>
<p>This account is not without its anomalies. The anti-crack generation didn&rsquo;t all join the church choir; recall that this same cohort was responsible for the crime spike of the early &rsquo;90s. Nor did they entirely abandon drugs; many turned instead to the &#8220;softer&#8221; hallucinogen, marijuana. Clearly, however, they abandoned crime at an earlier age than the previous generation. And it is this change in black lower class culture, a nationwide and seemingly sudden development in the mid-1990s, that offers the best explanation for America&rsquo;s great crime decline.</p>
<p><b>Preserving the Peace</b></p>
<p>The African-American crime problem is not solved. There remain persistent and frightening pockets of violence in many of America&rsquo;s big cities. The latest crime figures, from 2000 to 2007, are mixed. While black teenage murder rates have risen 21.8%, the rates of the most homicidal group, African-American males ages 18 to 24, have fallen another 4.9%. Still, when we compare the latest figures to those of the early 1990s, the positive overall trends are unmistakable and quite remarkable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just as black lawlessness from the late &rsquo;60s to the early &rsquo;90s threatened to unravel the social fabric of this country, the new black law-abidingness could, if we remain vigilant, put the United States on the road to sustainable crime control.<br>

<p>My wife owns a successful catering business in this neighborhood.<br>
Its rare to see gentrifiers who are black. It  gives us an inside look of whats going on. At the  community meetings my wife provides food for, we  always hear the upper middle class people complaining about the pathological behaviors of the low income black people. Class tensions are starting to rise. They are trying to kick the poor people out instead of trying to be shinning role models for them. Where is the anger from Jese and Sharpton?  I&rsquo;m happy to see a black neighborhood that is successful or is at least trying. This means they will stay in their own neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about the early-to-mid-to-late 1990s, I agree with increased imprisonment explaining the homicide drop.   But let me float two other theories</p>
<p>* Many states that now have conceal carry adopted it during this time period.  Prof. John Lott has proven that CCW is the best crime deterrent of legitimate measures under consideration.</p>
<p>* As time progresses, homicide, or the drop thereof, as an indicator of how safe or unsafe an area is, is somewhat a bit of legerdemain.  The reason is that emergency rooms are getting so much better at saving the lives of people who are wheeled in because their pals made holes in them.  So part of this drop might be simply because the shooting victim didn&rsquo;t die because the ER saved his life in 2000 when they could not in 1994.  Therefore, no homicide and no murder charges.  The thing to look at is the rate of aggravated assault, to prove or disprove this particular theory of mine.</p>

			<p>Place giant vats of cat food in the African savanna and fewer wildebeests will be killed. Does this mean the lions have become less violent by nature?  No.  It simply means their violence has been mitigated by the sudden windfall.  Similarly we constantly read about the &#8220;growing black middle class&#8221; - but this &#8220;middle class&#8221; was built at the expense of whites who are subject to massive and systematic discrimination (&#8220;affirmative action&#8221;).  Those middle class jobs, middle class schools and middle class homes are like vats of cat food in the African savanna.  They will mitigate black violence to a certain extent but they are not a long-term solution.  Once a level, and fair, playing field is restored, most middle class blacks will revert to poverty and crime.</p>
<p>Can blacks change their overall nature and actually become as the MSM depicts them?  It&rsquo;s dubious but, should it ever happen and blacks behave the same as whites (as a group), then I have no doubt that negative perceptions (what the MSM calls &#8220;racism&#8221;) would disappear in short order.</p>

			<p>Astonishing, nearly a book length and Concealed carry firearms as deterring crime is never even mentioned! Guns are referred to twice, both times by criminal offenders, but never the fact that States since 1987 (starting with Florida) allowed people to carry concealed weapons and the crime rate dropped each time. Now 48 States have concealed carry (most with Shall Issue) and the rate for each of those states drop. Has this guy read &#8220;Death by Gun Control&#8221; or any of the Scholarly work on Crime and Concealed carry?</p>

			<p>      These numbers may be correct, but I bet the change is very<br>
fragile. The system may have succeeded at buying Blacks off with<br>
exorbitant amounts of afirmative action and welfare-all of it at<br>
our expense. As soon as the goodies begin to drop off-as they<br>
must, Blacks will revert to their old ways.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Berkeley criminologist Franklin Zimring&rsquo;s The Great American Crime Decline (2007) barely discusses race and does not even have an index entry for blacks or any other racial category. &#8220;</p>
<p>Zimring is an academic who specializes in trying to inflict ever MORE gun control upon Amerika. Remember, Gun Control in the past half-century is about making non-Blacks vulnerable to the predations of Blacks.</p>

&#8220;So part of this drop might be simply because the shooting victim didn&rsquo;t die because the ER saved his life in 2000 when they could not in 1994&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;  -<br>
I believe there is merit to your theory. After all, it has been proven that the best doctors are those who come from a war zone &hellip; and isn&rsquo;t that what all US inner cities really are?</p>

			<p>&#8220;A part of the decline in black crime may well have been caused by simple mobility: blacks have moved away from some of the most troubled and crime-ridden big cities. {snip} In the &rsquo;90s {snip} North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida saw the biggest growth in their black populations; New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, the biggest declines.&rsquo;</p>
<p>  Certainly, the crime rates in places like Jacksonville, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia and Charlotte, North Carolina have increased due to the before mentioned black migration from the Northeast. Even in my own small Southern town, black criminals from Philadelphia and D.C. have caused a minor crime wave. This is improvement?</p>

			<p>There was something weird going on during the 90&rsquo;s. As crime rates were going down, &#8216;50%&rsquo;, the prison population doubled to a total of almost 2 million in some form of lock down, state, local, or federal, the highest number ever, for the whole world. The media made a big deal about the drop in crime during the 1990&rsquo;s. We were supposed to attribute this to Bill Clinton&rsquo;s wisdom and benevolence, I do believe. To my knowledge the media never spoke about these 2 stories together. Not within 2 miles of each other.</p>
<p>Something else I noticed about the liberal media. I was calling this before Obama was even elected. Before the Democratic National Convention even? With the economy in the turmoil it&rsquo;s in, Obama is the new Reagan. At least if Obama fixes the economy from the disaster it&rsquo;s in. Liberals, though, always say Reaganomics &#8216;trickle down&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t work, and often manage to present this as history. For all the Rush Limbaugh fans out there, all you have to do is say something like, &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t have 9% unemployment with Bush!&#8221;, when they respond saying something about how it&rsquo;s not Obama&rsquo;s fault at all he&rsquo;s only fixing things, you say, &#8220;oh, that only works with Reagan&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Question Diversity makes some good points concerning CCW and improved medical technology and technique. </p>
<p>Another aspect to consider might be the accuracy of the available crime stats. Baltimore, for example, is notorious for fudging their official crime numbers (&#8220;juking the stats,&#8221; as the locals like to call it). Occasionally, whole crimes disappear altogether from the books, but most often it&rsquo;s done by altering classifications: a rape gets entered as an aggravated assault, an ag assault as a simple assault, you get the picture. </p>
<p>The wide range of stats and bean counters in different areas might make this very difficult to study in depth, but I reckon any serious study into crime rates must take it into consideration.</p>

			<p>During WW2, there were 3 wounded for ever dead soldier.  In Iraq, it&rsquo;s something like 17 wounded for every KIA.  Yes, improved surgical techniques make a lot of difference.<br>
     I read years ago that statisticians liked to use homicide as a gauge of violence, because homicides were more likely to be reported.  Perhaps they should begin to count all firearms injuries as a more accurate shorthand statistical method.   <br>
     Honestly, I find it hard to believe that today&rsquo;s ghetto youth have learned anything.  I would guess that a combination of improved trauma care and government jobs for Blacks have more to do with this reported change that any increase in wisdom.</p>

			<p>BW Sam:</p>
<p>Great point.  St. Louis does the same thing, they don&rsquo;t automatically count a dead body found in the city as a homicide.  There are lies, damned lies, and homicide and crime stats.  Pandering politicians will fudge them downward when they want white yuppie libs to move into the central cities (speaking of which, the St. Louis City mayor election is today), and fudge them upward when they want a handout from the Federal Uncle Sap government or more gun control, or a sales tax for &#8220;recreation center&#8221; to stop crime.</p>
<p>Yes, Francis Slay, I&rsquo;m thinking of you.  This is a Mayor, who, within one day, said that crime was low so move back into the city, then said crime was high so pass this sales tax for recreation centers.</p>

			<p>tigers cannot change their stripes. <br>
crime penalties need to be GREATLY increased, to keep Americans safe, and eradicate those who wish to predate on others. I don&rsquo;t care what color they are. until that happens, we and our children will all be in danger.</p>
