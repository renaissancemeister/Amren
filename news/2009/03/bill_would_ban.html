<h1>Bill Would Ban Headwear on Driver&rsquo;s License Photos</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Lauritsen, WCCO-TV (Minneapolis), March 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most people don&rsquo;t like their driver&rsquo;s license picture, but if a state lawmaker has his way, one group of Minnesotans said they are going to like theirs even less. State Rep. Steve Gottwalt of St. Cloud is trying to pass a bill that would ban any kind of headwear worn on a driver&rsquo;s license pictures.</p>
<p>Gottwalt said it is a matter of safety to help law enforcement identify people easier. However, people in the Muslim community said covering their heads is their religious right.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Suban] Khalif and Hindia Ali are Muslim women. As part of their faith, they wear a head scarf nearly 24 hours a day. To take it off, for even a few minutes, is a big deal. That is why the women are so opposed to Gottwalt&rsquo;s bill. They think their faces are enough to identify them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My facial expressions, my face, my nose, my eyes should be clearly enough for any person to tell us apart,&#8221; Ali agreed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really not about religion at all. It&rsquo;s about public safety,&#8221; said Gottwalt.</p>
<p>Gottwalt said the motivation for this bill came from law enforcement. He said it is not about singling anyone out, it is about keeping headwear off everyone&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license picture in order to make it fair, and to make it easier for police.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve heard law enforcement people tell us about gangbangers wearing their hats differently and those kinds of things that kind of get in the way of quickly identifying who this person is,&#8221; said Gottwalt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gottwalt&rsquo;s bill allows for some exceptions. If a person has a deformity or a medial condition that requires headwear, then they can wear it for their driver&rsquo;s license picture. Gottwalt said he is hoping to get a committee hearing for the bill soon. The state of Alabama is considering similar legislation.<br>

			<p> God made heads before man made hats, turbans, etc. Steve Gottwalt is right about the law enforcement aspect of it, but I have a question about the matter of head coverings: Why is it that human beings so often feel that they have to have their heads covered so much of the time? And especially in the case of women: If the sight of women&rsquo;s hair causes men to have &#8220;impure thoughts,&#8221; as Muslims and others allege, then why don&rsquo;t they concentrate on teaching the men self control? I, for one, will not wear a hat unless it&rsquo;s so cold outside that I have to cover my ears with a toboggan to avoid frostbite. And I can testify that walking about bareheaded is very liberating!</p>

			<p>There is a solution to this. Take off the headwear or no license. These people have been calling the tune long enough. Just ask The Brits - if you can still find any in England. I heard a Muslim spokeswoman today say that &#8220;Islam is an American religion.&#8221; No, Madam, it isn&rsquo;t. This country was founded on Judeo-Christian beliefs. If you want an Islamic country, there are many to choose from in the Middle East. Our culture is far too different from your, so you might be happier at HOME.</p>

<p>Let these probably black American muslim convert women go to Saudi and try to get a drivers license. Muslim women are not supposed to drive!!!</p>

			<p>We have a law in Alberta that says that Hutterites can have a drivers license without a photo as a photo would violate their religious freedom!</p>
<p>A few years ago there were issues with regard to the massive land holdings of Hutterites.</p>
<p>They continue to expand, but at least they do not try to convert anyone and are quite peaceful.</p>
<p>Corporate religion with all its benefits to the cult.</p>

			<p>Could be quite amusing. Arrest one at home for a hit and run offence and show copy of a driving licence complete with photo of &#8216;eyes-only&rsquo; showing in a black hood. Produce CTTV footage of similar dressed woman at the scene. If woman objects, ask which woman was with her husband, also at the scene. All a spoof of course, but shows what could happen if this nonsense is permitted. BTW, arab women in Bahrain do have licences and drive, but not wearing hoods although they do cover their hair with a scarf. Makes saudi women visitors hopping mad as they are not allowed to drive at all. Bahraini women are not allowed to drive across the causeway into KSA as the religeous police there would stop them at the border. So this claim from muslim women in the above story is, once more, utter islamic twaddle. If they are not permitted to uncover their faces, ergo they are not permitted to drive, they should stay at home, as islam dictates.</p>

			<p>In high school, I used to wear my baseball cap in class as a protest to the doube standards afforded to the muslim students. Whenever the teacher would order me to take it off, I&rsquo;d claim religious freedom. When they asked me what reigion allowed me to wear a baseball cap all the time, I&rsquo;d tell them that my religion was personal and that they have no business prying into my personal beliefs. I said my beliefs are just as valid as anyone else&rsquo;s and that I didn&rsquo;t have to be a part of an organized religion to have them recognized. I did this for about a month, but my father didn&rsquo;t support my trroublemaking, even if he agreed with my point, so I had to quit.</p>
<p>Next time I get my license at the DMV, I&rsquo;ll try this again.</p>

			<p>The Koran only tells women to &#8220;dress modestly&#8221;.  I know this because I have actually read the Koran, as I found one in prison on the &#8220;free stuff&#8221; shelf on night in our dorm (I also issued myself and friends lots of shoes and other goodies off that shelf, as I stayed up late at night, reading and working out the hot rod builds that later made me lots of money.)  I left the Koran full of chicharone (pork rind) crumbs.</p>
<p>The Koran does not tell women to cover their hair or their faces, and the most literal interpretation of this stricture, at the time it was written, would be an ankle-length dress with long sleeves.</p>
<p>In Australia in 1998, I saw some Persian girls welcoming a visiting Iranian soccer team.  The girls were wearing swimsuits and waving Iranian flags.  They looked quite nice, but the soccer players had obviously never seen anything quite like them.</p>
