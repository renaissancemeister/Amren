<h1>Hispanic Enrollment in Schools, Colleges Rising</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, AP, March 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Roughly one-fourth of the nation&rsquo;s kindergartners are Hispanic, evidence of an accelerating trend that now will see minority children become the majority by 2023.</p>
<p>Census data released Thursday also showed that Hispanics make up about one-fifth of all K-12 students. Hispanics&rsquo; growth and changes in the youth population are certain to influence political debate, from jobs and immigration to the No Child Left Behind education, for years.</p>
<p>The ethnic shifts in school enrollment are most evident in the West. States such as Arizona, California and Nevada are seeing an influx of Hispanics due to immigration and higher birth rates.</p>
<p>Minority students in that region exceed non-Hispanic whites at the pre-college grade levels, with about 37 percent of the students Hispanic. Hispanics make up 54 percent of the students in New Mexico, 47 percent in California, 44 percent in Texas and 40 percent in Arizona.</p>
<p>In 2007, more than 40 percent of all students in K-12 were minorities  &mdash;  Hispanics, blacks, Asian-Americans and others. That&rsquo;s double the percentage of three decades ago.</p>
<p>In colleges, Hispanics made up 12 percent of full-time undergraduate and graduate students, 2 percent more than in 2006. Still, that is short of Hispanics&rsquo; 15 percent representation in the total U.S. population.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of our education system depends on how we can advance Hispanics through the ranks,&#8221; said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington. &#8220;In many cases it&rsquo;s going to be a challenge, because they are the children of immigrants, and their English is not as strong. Many have parents without a high school or college education.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics account for more than 23 percent of kindergartners in private and public schools, according to 2007 data. That is more than triple Hispanics&rsquo; percentage in the 1970s, the height of white baby boom enrollment in elementary and high school.</p>
<p>More Hispanic kindergartners in 2007 were U.S.-born than foreign-born, assuring them of citizenship that will make them eligible to vote by 2020.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other findings from the data:</p>
<p>* About 58 percent of children enrolled in grades K-12 are non-Hispanic whites, a group that represents 66 percent of the U.S. population. After Hispanics, blacks were the second-largest minority group enrolled in K-12 (15 percent), followed by Asians (4 percent).</p>
<p>* Fifty-three percent of Hispanic 4-year-olds were enrolled in nursery school, compared with 43 percent in 1997 and 21 percent in 1987.</p>
<p>The census data was based on the Current Population Survey. Data on U.S. regions and states came from the 2007 American Community Survey, the government&rsquo;s annual survey of about 3 million households.<br>

			<p>The country is finished and the sun is setting. It happens to all civilizations. The socialistic state will expand until collapse( The exact reason California is collapsing). So when does the minority that becomes the majority stop getting Aid?? and assistance&hellip;. they wont!, thus the collapse.</p>
<p>As for whites if we wake up in 20 years or so we might have strong holds in places like Iceland, New Zealand, Australia etc.</p>

			<p>Funny thing, they can&rsquo;t even ask the obvious question: Where did they all come from? Neither could the TV news yesterday when covering this story.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;The future of our education system depends on how we can advance Hispanics through the ranks,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps we can declare them to be the children of invaders and deport them along with their parents, instead of wasting money trying to educate them.</p>

			<p>40 percent of all American K-12 students are non-white.  Remember this when you read about America&rsquo;s low standing on test scores compared to their peers in other industrialized countries.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;The future of our education system depends on how we can advance Hispanics through the ranks,&rdquo; said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington.</i></p>
<p>So, are they just going to &#8220;advance&#8221; them? Pass them through college based on their race and ethnicity, not on their merit? Is that what our education bureaucrats intend? Yes, it is. I know. I taught them for two decades in a University of Texas branch campus in North Texas. And even during that time, the pressure to &#8220;advance&#8221; them was enormous, despite the absence of fundamental writing skills. As for reasoning, analytical ability, and work ethic? Forget it. Of course, I speak for the hispanic cohort in general. Exceptional hispanic students do exist, just in far fewer numbers than their White European descended counterparts.</p>
<p>BTW, when hispanics do alight onto a campus in numbers beyond their percentage of the population, the results are terrifying, both in the work they achieve and the obeisance of the instructors to low grade hispanic achievement. Just visit a place such as California State University, Dominguez Hills, with a student population that is 40 percent hispanic. It&rsquo;s little more than a holding pen, keeping gangbangers distracted from their preferred occupation  &mdash;  criminal. Such places do not deserve the designation &#8220;college&#8221;, &#8220;university&#8221;, or even &#8220;educational institution&#8221;. </p>
<p>Is Dominguez Hills the future face of higher education in the formerly American southwest and west? Similar demographic disasters are building at U Texas branch campuses in South Texas. I&rsquo;ll bet similar scenarios are playing out in Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado.</p>

			<p>These average figures are remarkably deceptive. </p>
<p>In far too many public school districts (K-12), the percentage of hispanic students is one hundred percent, or nearly one hundred percent (100%). </p>
<p>Why is it acceptable for entire school districts to be nearly 100% hispanic, but it is somehow wrong for other school districts to be nearly 100% white?<br>

			<p>And this increased enrollment in colleges of hispanics is supposed to prove what? In light of affirmative action, quotas, Mecha, Lulac, Maldef, insane liberal progressives that basically break every rule to make sure unqualified students get accepted into colleges,etc.  &mdash;  what is the big surprise that hispanic enrollement is up?? The government run education system is so trashed nowaday, that a bright eight grader could get into most colleges.</p>

			<p>A couple years ago I watched a school bus unload kids in front othe public housing unit (poverty breeder) down the street, here in People&rsquo;s Rep of California.  The entire bus emptied out at this one stop, and not a single kid was white.  There&rsquo;s the future of California.  Coming soon to a neighborhood near you!</p>

			<p> Most high schools, colleges, and Universities across the<br>
 United States are significantly dumbed down.<br>
 Lower performing students are widely apparent and their<br>
 standards of achievment and character are significantly reduced in comparison to graduating students less than 10 years ago.<br>

			<p>When this all shakes out, with revolution or prayer for quick death, the one thing that really incentivized and snowballed the rush over our border was the offer of a &#8220;free education&#8221;.   </p>
<p>History will record that the U.S. citizen taxpayer did not agree to pay to educate the illegal aliens nor their children.  And, by the way, would still not agree. This was done by a liberal-leaning Supreme Court in the landmark decision, Plyler vs. D.O.E. in 1982.  By judicial fiat, our country rang the dinner bell heard across the world, that anyone who could get here was &#8220;entitled&#8221; to a free education.  </p>
<p>The debacle in the K-12 public education system is now almost a fait accompli.  Public urban schools do very little educating, and are simply babysitting for the penal and welfare systems.</p>
<p>The solution will be so draconian, most of our suicidal nation will quick frankly not stomach it.  Only those patriots who will take a stand and can tolerate the repercussions can salvage the U.S. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much of a challenge for Jews, Poles, Italians, Germans, Russians, and other White immigrants. They were essentially assimilated in one generation.  They may have eaten ethnic food with grandma on Sunday afternoon, (and for the Italians, who would want to give that up?), but they wanted to be and were Americans.  </p>
<p>Mestizos want welfare and gang membership.  Not only is their English, &#8220;not strong&#8221;, they don&rsquo;t do that well in Spanish either.<br>
One hundred years from now, the USA probably won&rsquo;t be here, and Whites may be holed up in protected enclaves in various locations around the globe, but blacks and mestizos will still be the same: backward, illiterate, uncivilized, irresponsible.  </p>

Why do I get the uncomfortable feeling OUR TAXES are wasted, by indirectly ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION with our stupid, misguided generosity?</p>

The reality is, we have waved the white flag to a parasitic, third world, corrupt and violent country that did not need to conquer in any way but simply walk in and take over. How shameful!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Marxist traitors are the root cause of the problem.  The bottom line is that whites have become complacent and selfish; nothing is worth sacrificing or fighting for except comfort and wealth.</p>
<p>When I was 15 or 16 years old, I had my hours slashed at the restaurant I worked at as a busboy.  The reason was to make room for two illegals, a husband and wife, who apparently were discontent with the lower wages they received washing dishes.  I quit, and presumably the illegals stayed.  They probably went on to have several U.S. born children, who are now costing the taxpayers much more than my employers saved by using them.  My employers weren&rsquo;t Marxists, they were capitalists trying to make as much money possible. For every ideological, self-loathing, marxist white, how many complacent, greedy whites are there that will go along with just about anything as long as it doesn&rsquo;t immediately threaten their bank account or comfortable level?  Ten to one?  One-hundred to one?  </p>

			<p>This is war against the U.S. The weapon of choice of the attackers is demographics: mass &#8220;migration&#8221; and fast breeding. And we are losing this war due to treachery of our (shadow) government and media who blatantly side with the invaders.</p>
<p>There should be a law on traitors who claim that this unprecedented in scale population displacement is OK (or even someting we are supposed to look forward to) because &#8220;all people are equal&#8221;. And the punishment should be harsh. No mercy for the traitors.</p>
<p><b>This hostile takeover will succeed unless it meets with equaly hostile response</b>. Our national survival is at stake, so it&rsquo;s not time to be gentle and tolerant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not a done deal, so hurry up, defend America before it&rsquo;s too late.<br>

<p>Not exactly. A liberal, college educated ruling class decided that Americans weren&rsquo;t sufficiently servile, so they decided to elect a new people by changing our immigration laws and enacting The Great Society to enhance their own power by expanding the brown multitudes. Thank the Ivy League universities for creating this rapidly swelling welfare dependent political class.</p>
<p>The new people are all from tribal societies with extremely low human capital (intelligence). That guarantees they need to be taken care of, and whites will be impressed as tax slaves. It also means all the great cultural achievements that were possible in the not so distant future, just before the 1965 immigration act    &mdash;   space exploration, a cure for cancer, an end to poverty, unlimited cheap nuclear energy, a steady state population   &mdash;   were all put on hold indefinitely.</p>
<p>We were indeed on the threshold of a Utopian future. No we are on the threshold of annihilation. </p>

We can lament all we want but when we have failed to have enough children ourselves due primarily to the fact that we have to have the best house, best car etc&hellip;who really is to blame&hellip; Maybe some of the wealthier white readers should think about supplementing a young white couples income so the mom can stay home and have healthy babies!!

			<p>Todd, whites cannot keep up with darker folks in the child bearing department because we are not subsidized like they are. They literally have no worries (and do not worry). It takes all my wife&rsquo;s time and resources and mine to raise our three children. I see the latinos here in Southern California and it&rsquo;s obvious the government or who really controls it wants a low IQ servant population with Asians to maintain technical infrastructure. Even the working latinos are eligible for WIC, food stamps, the women will lie if they&rsquo;re married and say they&rsquo;re not to get more goodies, the illegal&rsquo;s have children who are eligible for welfare and more, they get housing subsidies, Section 8, housing vouchers and lots more. All over you see pregnant mestizo women, not working, with 6 or 7 kids in tow. All of it paid for by us. It wasn&rsquo;t the people of CA allowing this, it was the government forcing it on us and it&rsquo;s headed your way, all over the US. The time to run is over. </p>
<p>As for schools, we have our children in private schools, which is of course another expense, which the elites don&rsquo;t mind as they see it as another drain on white&rsquo;s financial resources. Our oldest started in public school, but between the fights, even in 1st and 2nd grade with Mexicans and the obvious inability of the latinos to ever sit still and learn we pulled him out and the others never set foot in public school. Yes, the IQ studies have to be true, these people are not smart enough as a group to do much academically. Once in a while a smart one shows up and the media trumpets as if all of them are budding geniuses if given the chance. The fact is most of them are budding low IQ gangsters. Look at the L.A. High School campuses. Most of the latinos in school seem to be gangbangers and less than 50% of latinos make it to graduation even with social promotion. The Marxists destroyed CA and a lot of the US in 40 years. Sickening. </p>

			<p>This is going to be the end of America, at least as we know it. Either the southwest will eventually break away and rejoin Mexico - a kind of reversal of the Mexican-American war in 1848 - or America will eventually become a Latin American style country, perhaps like Mexico or Brazil. Either result will be disastrous for us. There is nothing inspiring about Mexican Mestizios that I can see, short and with low-I.Q.&rsquo;s. All the Mestizios countries are a shambles. Just look at what is going on now in California for what America&rsquo;s future shows. California was within living memory a great place to live. Now its a bankrupt third world hellhole.</p>
