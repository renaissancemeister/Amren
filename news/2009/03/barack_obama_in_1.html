<h1>Barack Obama in His Own Words (Part I of III)</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Henderson, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> March 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This appraisal of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s character is based on his two books, <cite>Dreams From My Father</cite> (DMF) and <cite>The Audacity of Hope</cite> (AOH). The advantage of relying on these sources is that they are not only Mr. Obama&rsquo;s own words but his considered words. He cannot claim that were written hastily and without reflection.</p>
<p>It is also worth bearing in mind that the first book, DMF, was written in 1995 when Mr. Obama was a married man in his mid-thirties. Hence, it reflects his mature views, not those of a giddy teenager. In addition, Mr. Obama agreed to the republication of DMF in 2004 when he was already an established politician, so his 1995 views cannot be written off as something that do not represent his present thinking. Together with <cite>The Audacity of Hope,</cite> written in 2006, these two books give us a picture of Mr. Obama before he started his political career and after he became a politician.</p>
<p><b>Shaping the Past</b></p>
<p>Both books are filled with great swathes of what appears to be reported speech. These are ostensibly conversations from Mr. Obama&rsquo;s early childhood onwards. In the case of DMF, a casual reader could easily think he had picked up a novel.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama says coyly in the introduction to DMF that &#8220;although much of my book is based on contemporaneous journals or the oral histories of my family, the dialogue is necessarily an approximation of what was actually said or relayed to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Approximation is putting it mildly because Mr. Obama &#8220;recalls&#8221; astonishingly vast tracks of dialogue from all stages of his life. There are many pages of almost continuous dialogue, and when he meets his Kenyan half-sister Auma for the first time we get a monologue that takes up almost seven pages. (DMF pp. 212&#150;219.) As for contemporaneous journals, nowhere does Mr. Obama mention keeping such records or refer to journals kept by others. As he is the protagonist in almost all the dialogue, he is presumably relying almost entirely on &#8220;oral history,&#8221; a notoriously unreliable source.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s writing veers even further into fiction because, as he writes, &#8220;For the sake of compression, some of the characters that appear are composites of people I&rsquo;ve known, and some events appear out of precise chronology.&#8221; The books are often vague about even approximately when an event occurred. Mr. Obama then tops all this imprecision by telling the reader, &#8220;With the exception of my family and a handful of public figures, the names of most characters have been changed for the sake of their privacy.&#8221; This sounds like a device to make sure nosey journalists ask no awkward questions and that the people he writes about raise no objections.</p>
<p>The use of invented dialogue, fictional names, composite characters, and a vague chronology means we cannot tell whether Mr. Obama is putting his own views into other characters&rsquo; mouths or whether they speak for themselves. For example, take this rant against white oppression from an old black friend from his childhood whom he calls Frank:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Leaving your race at the door&#8221; he said. &#8220;Leaving your people behind.&#8221; He studied me over the top of his reading glasses. &#8220;Understand something, boy. You&rsquo;re not going to college to get educated. You&rsquo;re going there to get trained. They&rsquo;ll train you to want what you don&rsquo;t need. They&rsquo;ll train you to manipulate words so they don&rsquo;t mean anything anymore. They&rsquo;ll train you to forget what it is that you already know. They&rsquo;ll train you so good, you&rsquo;ll start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the American way and all that shit. They&rsquo;ll give you a corner office and invite you to fancy dinners, and tell you you&rsquo;re a credit to your race. Until you want to actually start running things, and then they&rsquo;ll yank on your chain and let you know that you may be a well-trained, well-paid nigger, but you&rsquo;re a nigger just the Same.&#8221; (DMF p. 97.)
</blockquote>Is that Mr. Obama talking or Frank? Who knows, although it is a fact that when Mr. Obama creates dialogue that is openly anti-white  &mdash;  and there is a good deal of it in DMF  &mdash;  he either does not condemn it outright or even treat it as unsavory or dangerous. The most he ever does is pose quiet arguments against such views but they are so wrapped in qualifications one can never be certain of his position. Moreover, his toleration for more than 20 years of Jeremiah Wright is a strong hint that much of the anti-white animus he reports in the mouths of others is not uncongenial to him. Mr. Obama also reports dialogue in which he himself expresses anti-white feelings. Here he is as a student talking about Conrad&rsquo;s <cite>Heart of Darkness:</cite><blockquote>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a racist book. The way Conrad sees it, Africa&rsquo;s a cesspool of the world, black folks are savages, and any contact with them breeds infection.
<p>Regina blew on her coffee. &#8220;So why are you reading it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&rsquo;s assigned,&#8221; I paused, not sure if I should go on. &#8220;And because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>
<p>&#8220;And because the book teaches me things.&#8221; I said. &#8220;About white people, I mean. See, the book&rsquo;s not really about Africa. Or black people. It&rsquo;s about the man who wrote it. The European. The American. A particular way of looking at the world. If you can keep your distance, it&rsquo;s all there, in what&rsquo;s said and what&rsquo;s left unsaid. So I read the book to help me understand just what makes white folks so afraid. Their demons. The way ideas get twisted around. It helps me understand how people learn to hate.&#8221; (DMF p. 103.)<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>The reader cannot help wondering whether what Mr. Obama writes is really true. A pointer towards a general carelessness about the truth is the fact that the tone of the dialogue is uniform. Whether he is a speaking as a boy, college student, married family man, or senator he is much the same. This uniformity of style strongly suggests that all we are hearing is Mr. Obama as the man he was when he wrote either book, not what he was at various points in his life.</p>
<p>Here he is supposedly speaking, as a boy of less then ten, with his Indonesian step-father Lolo.<blockquote>&#8220;Have you ever seen a man killed?&#8221; I asked him.</p>
<p>He glanced down, surprised by the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you?&#8221; I asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it bloody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought for a moment. &#8220;Why was the man killed? The one you saw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he was weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lob shrugged and rolled his pant leg back down. &#8220;That&rsquo;s usually enough. Men take advantage of weakness in other men. They&rsquo;re like countries in that way. The strong man takes the weak man&rsquo;s land. He makes the weak man work in his fields. If the weak man&rsquo;s woman is pretty, the strong man will take her.&#8221; He paused to take another sip of water, then asked, &#8220;Which would you rather be?&#8221; (DMF p. 40.)<br>
</blockquote>Besides being sometimes utterly improbable, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s dialogue invariably serves some purpose that benefits him. He manipulates the supposedly real-life people the way a novelist manipulates characters, to fit the story he wants to tell. If Mr. Obama wants to describe black victimhood, up pops a character to say how hard done by blacks are and always have been. If he wants to agonize about his racial heritage, along comes someone to say exactly what he needs to start his own self-examination. If he wants to expand on his political policies and philosophy, up pops someone with exactly the right peg on which to hang a disquisition. Here is Mr. Obama using a white English doctor he calls Wilkerson, who is working in Malawi:<blockquote>&#8220;I asked him why he thought he had come back to Africa and he answered without a pause, as if he&rsquo;d heard the question many times.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s my home, I suppose. The people, the land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; He took off his glasses and wiped them with a handkerchief. [Mr. Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;memory&#8221; for such gestures is uncanny.] &#8220;It&rsquo;s funny, you know. Once you&rsquo;ve lived here for a time, the life in England seems terribly cramped. The British have so much more, but seem to enjoy things less. I felt a foreigner there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his glasses back on and shrugged. &#8220;Of course, I know that in the long run I need to be replaced. That&rsquo;s part of my job  &mdash;  making myself unnecessary. The Malawian doctors I work with are excellent, really. Competent. Dedicated. If we could just build a training hospital, some decent facilities, we could triple their number in no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned toward the campfire, and I thought his voice began to waver. &#8220;Perhaps I can never call this place home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sins of the father, you know. I&rsquo;ve learned to accept that.&#8221; He paused for a moment, then looked at me.&#8221; (DMF p. 355.)<br>
</blockquote>The passage neatly lets Mr. Obama promote the idea of white guilt, redemption through service to Africans, white dissatisfaction for their own society, and white yearning for Africa  &mdash;  although it is a yearning they can never satisfy because they do not belong there.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that what Mr. Obama is giving us is no more than his heavily edited version of the past at best and pure fantasy at worst.</p>
<p>What does his choice of this form of narrative tell us about Mr. Obama? It suggests he is a man who is determined to shape reality to his own idea of himself. Why should he do this? As we will see there is plenty in the books to suggest he is insecure, someone who cannot deal with criticism and who frets over how others view him.</p>
<p>This is disturbing behavior for anyone, let alone someone who wanted to go into politics. I cannot think of any other politician who has used the pseudo-novelistic approach to tell his life story.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s Background</b></p>
<p>If we assume that genes play a strong role in determining character, what can we learn from Mr. Obama&rsquo;s ancestry?</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that he got himself an education, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s behavior matches the modern stereotype of the black man. He goes from one woman to another breeding incontinently, and this explains why Mr. Obama has so many half-brothers and half-sisters. He leaves Mr. Obama&rsquo;s mother when Barack is still a toddler and then reappears rarely in the boy&rsquo;s life. From Mr. Obama&rsquo;s account, he provided his mother with no money whatsoever, and back in Africa he variously abandoned and neglected his other women and children. He became a drunk and ruined his job prospects by recklessly insulting influential people. Here is Mr. Obama&rsquo;s account of his half-sister Auma describing his father&rsquo;s behavior towards members of the Kenyan elite:<blockquote>&#8220;When he was passed up for a promotion, he complained loudly. &#8216;How can you be my senior,&rsquo; he would say to one of the ministers, &#8216;and yet I am teaching you how to do your job properly?&rsquo;&#8221; (DMF p. 215.)<br>
</blockquote>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, a white woman from middle America, marries first an African then an Indonesian, but neither marriage lasts. For someone of her background to marry one person of a different race and culture might be put down to love; marrying two looks like a political statement. She takes Mr. Obama to Indonesia then sends him back to the USA  &mdash;  Hawaii  &mdash;  after several years to live with his mother&rsquo;s parents. Eventually she returns to the USA and takes an anthropology degree, during which time Mr. Obama lives with her. After she finishes her degree, she leaves Mr. Obama once more with her parents while she goes abroad for anthropological fieldwork.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s description of his mother makes her sound like a Margaret Mead anthropological na&#239;f, forever searching for the right approach to non-white, non-American people while ironically insisting most of the time that Mr. Obama be brought up as an American. Mr. Obama describes her attitude towards blacks:<blockquote> Every black man was Thurgood Marshall or Sidney Poitier; every black woman Fannie Lou Hamer or Lena Horne. To be black was to be the beneficiary of a great inheritance, a special destiny, glorious burdens that only we were strong enough to bear. Burdens we were to carry with style. More than once, my mother would point out, &#8220;Harry Belafonte is the best-looking man on the planet.&#8221; (DMF p. 51.)<br>
</blockquote>It is clear that Mr. Obama&rsquo;s parents were unusually selfish and egotistical, far more concerned with satisfying their own wants than caring for others, even their children. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s description of their personalities, both through his own presumed recollection and that of others, paints a picture of reckless self-absorption.</p>
<p>As for his grandparents, if Mr. Obama is to be believed, his grandfather was a restless, undisciplined man who never made a success of anything, flitting from place to place and job to job until he finally settled in Hawaii. His grandmother, despite Mr. Obama&rsquo;s attempt to paint her as a feminist trailblazer as the first female vice-president of a local Hawaiian bank, comes across as curiously colorless for someone Mr. Obama claims loomed very large in his emotional life.</p>
<p>Apart from five years in Indonesia with his Indonesian step-father, Mr. Obama was raised by whites. For most of his childhood he lived in Hawaii which, because of its very varied population, probably gave him the least opportunity of any part of the country to experience segregation or racism.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama doesn&rsquo;t say so explicitly, but the implication is that his school was predominantly white. He goes on to good universities, Occidental and Columbia, which are predominantly white. After a short stint of community work among blacks he goes to white-dominated Harvard Law School and teaches constitutional law in white-dominated universities when he is not in the white-dominated Illinois legislature or the very white US Senate.</p>
<p>Such a background might have made Mr. Obama comfortable about both his racial mix and white society. In fact, the reverse is true. He was unlucky enough to have parents who both deserted him. That alone could make him insecure, but what absorbs him is his racial background. The man is obsessed with the fact that he is between two worlds, the black and the white.</p>
<p>At the same time, one wonders just how popular he was as a child. Consider this: &#8220;During the entire time that I was growing up, I attended exactly two birthday parties, both of which involved five or six kids, cone hats, and a cake.&#8221; (AOH p. 349.)</p>
<p>Mr. Obama spent most of his childhood in a middle class world, in which birthday parties would have been very common. Why did he attend only two? Was he unpopular? Did this feed his feeling of exclusion? His later accounts of his college days and his time as a community organizer give the impression that his relations were frequently fractious, especially with other black men. Could it be that he is not generally liked at the personal level?</p>

		<p>That President Obama is descended from so many people who wallowed in their own selfishness and gratification might explain some of his habits as President today.  The scripted nature of these books foreshadows the scripted telepromptery nature of his Presidency so far, and the fact that he was willing to embellish the truth in a delusional nature is how he handles public policy, oblivious to certain fundamental concepts like human reality, budgetary constraints and public protest.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So I read the book (Heart of Darkness) to help me understand just what makes white folks so afraid. Their demons. The way ideas get twisted around. It helps me understand how people learn to hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a racist attitude to take about it? Or is that the attitude that&rsquo;s encouraged at Harvard? I find it hard to imagine white students being taught anything about people of color other than how noble they are. The Harvard student body is not as all white as the writer makes it out to be is it? </p>
<p>&#8220;His grandmother, despite Mr. Obama&rsquo;s attempt to paint her as a feminist trailblazer as the first female vice-president of a local Hawaiian bank, comes across as curiously colorless for someone Mr. Obama claims loomed very large in his emotional life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Feminist trailblazer&rsquo;? Everyone has a grandmother who is in charge of the local bank branch. You know, I say the following for effect, and kind of as a joke, but sometimes I wish we lived in the times I&rsquo;ve read about where only men were trusted to work at the bank. That&rsquo;s where things started to all go wrong&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;For someone of her (Stanley Ann Dunham) background to marry one person of a different race and culture might be put down to love; marrying two looks like a political statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The personal is political. Liberals have been living by that creed seemingly forever. Kind of a blackmail to get what they want. Holding us hostage by that creed. Always for a good cause of course. The only way of life they&rsquo;ve been exposed to. <br>

		<p>We won&rsquo;t hear the Democrats complaining of how Obama is not doing what he said he would do if he was elected. </p>
<p>Most Democrats didn&rsquo;t have a solid, intelligent reason for voting for him. </p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know what he said his stance was during the campaign, so they don&rsquo;t know what to compare to the stance he&rsquo;s taking now.</p>
<p>The fact is no one really knows what this man is about. I just know it&rsquo;s not good. </p>

		<p>I used to think being a pathological liar was a part of the African culture, but now I am starting to think that blacks are truly incapable of distinguishing fact from fiction, melding them together into an AOH type universe.<br>
That combined with the ethnomasochism of whites: https://cordeliaforlear.blogspot.com/2009/03/ethnomasochism-sad-state-of-euro.html<br>

<p>Obama knows how to play simple people like a violin, and most people are simple.</p>

The man is obsessed with the fact that he is between two worlds, the black and the white.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rather incisive and thought provoking observation by Mr. Henderson, along with the fact that this wretched nonentity, has gone to great lengths to &#8220;invent&#8221; a persona for public consumption and his own psychological purging. Moreover, his insecurities about himself and his racial identity, do oddly reflect on the times that have seen him rise to the highest political office in the land. Diversity and multiculturalism are what this country is supposed to believe in without question, but the reality of it always seems to fall very short of its promised rewards. </p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;enrichment,&#8221; we have overpopulation and financial chaos; instead of &#8220;unity,&#8221; we have growing social estrangements and conflicts; and instead of &#8220;strength,&#8221; we see these internal problems eroding our diplomatic and military positions. </p>
<p>Hence, the times do seem to reflect the &#8220;savior&#8221; who is both to represent the &#8220;achievements&#8221; of this neo-Marxist construct and perpetuate its future advancements. All the while, an accelerated angst about the vast nothingness both he and this system symbolizes, grows exponentially. </p>
<p>I fear that the abyss may be where all of this ends?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>I have found, about the psychology of mulattoes, that their basic attitude is if they can&rsquo;t be truly white, then nobody else should.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As far as President Obama&rsquo;s educational history, he admitted to goofing off, cutting most of his classes and doing drugs during his junior and senior years of high school, the exclusive Hawaiian one.  Yet, he somehow was able to graduate and get into Occidental College.  He didn&rsquo;t do that well there, and somehow was accepted to transfer to an Ivy League school (Columbia).  Didn&rsquo;t do to well there, either, but somehow got into Harvard Law.  He lucked into winning election as Editor of the Law Review, mostly because conservatives at the HLR picked him as the lesser of two evils versus a more stridently liberal candidate.  That and they could boast that they voted to put a black in as HLR Editor to head off what was massive criticism that comes from being white and a non-liberal at Harvard.</p>
<p>Plain words, he&rsquo;s lucked into or has been affirmative actioned into just about everything he has.  I will give him brownie points for defeating Clinton Inc. in the Democrat Primaries of last year, but as far as the general election, his opponent was McCain and, as Congressman Paul Kanjorski (D-PA) implied awhile back, and putting two and two together, George Soros (Obama supporter) crashed the American economy in September in order to get him elected.  Coming off the Republican Convention in early September, McCain had a 15 point lead in the polls.</p>

		<p>An overall good article, however I think the author dropped the ball on the ending of this segment. With Obama, it&rsquo;s not because he wasn&rsquo;t invited to enough birthday parties that explains his overall outlook on life. With Obama, it&rsquo;s race, race and race.</p>

		<p>As posters on this site probably know, there is a movement underway to force Obama to prove he was born in Hawaii and not Kenya. So far this movement hasn&rsquo;t gotten anywhere but it does seem to be gaining some momentum of late. And the fact Obama is fighting showing a genuine Hawaiian birth certificate is keeping the story alive. Farah of World Net Daily is the force behind this story. Since Obama is fighting this so hard it probably means he knows he was born in Africa. This story shows no sign of dying so things could get interesting. Many, including me, think we have a foreign born president, hence an illegal one. If we do, and he is removed, blacks will surely try to destroy the country. </p>

		<p>This only reinforces something I have suspected all along - that Barack Obama is above all, more an actor more than a genuine individual. He is playing a role for political gain and for political ends. As Obama&rsquo;s own scribblings clearly suggest, he is not simply a man - he is a character as in a novel. A character who can be made and molded to represent a sort of ideal, a living caricature even, who conveniently embodies all that is deemed glorious today - he is witty and well-spoken, fit and attractive(or so we are endlessly told), he is multiracial and therefore the ultimate representation of race-harmony/racelessness all at once, he is liberal and &#8220;tolerant&#8221; on all the &#8220;right&#8221; issues, he is hip and cool with the youth, etc., etc. </p>
<p>This is clearly all just too good to be true! Alas, Obama is&hellip;the perfect man!!! But we all know no one and nothing is perfect, especially that which is cleverly and cynically packaged to appear so, when the facts, even to the casual observer, suggest otherwise. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s politics may to some degree still be something of a mystery. Sure he&rsquo;s &#8220;liberal&#8221; but who in Washingtone, when all is said and done, is not? But what seems absolutely certain is that Obama is, by and large, a fraud - an actor on a stage, playing the role to the hilt. And as with the idiots in Hollywood, the American people(and many around the world) adore him, not for who he really is(whomever that may be) but for who and what he appears to be. Obama is too good to be true&hellip;and thus, sensible people should instinctively understand, all that is too good to be true isn&rsquo;t true at all. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I have found, about the psychology of mulattoes, that their basic attitude is if they can&rsquo;t be truly white, then nobody else should.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I too have found exactly the same. If they can&rsquo;t be [whatever], then nobody else can either.  </p>
<p>Another point to be made is that nowhere in this article is Bill Ayers mentioned. That topic  was discussed here in another article not long ago, and it was convincingly shown, by meticulous research done by some professor, that Ayers was the true author.</p>
<p>Thus, the public Obama is a sort of  Frankenstein-type creature put together and constructed by a whole team of promotors and manipulators to serve their own agenda.   What is that agenda? </p>
<p>Added to that, we have the giddy enthusiasm of the press, both here and around the world, universally breathless at how wonderful it all is.  This seems obviously orchestrated. It leaves you wondering just what is REALLY going on here? </p>

I can make a prediction about Obama which extends into his future after he is finished being president. That prediction is that he won&rsquo;t spend a lot of time trying to solve the problems of blacks. </p>
<p>This is because any mulatto who can escape being &#8220;black&#8221; will accept the opportunity.  He wanted to transcend his race, and he accomplished that, so the obsession with race will be part of his past. </p>

<p>I used to doubt that Obama citizenship doubters, as I thought all along that having one American parent automatically makes you American.  It does these days, but in 1961, when Barack H. Obama II was born, it wasn&rsquo;t the case   &mdash;   if you had one American and one non-American parent, your citizenship depended on where you were born.</p>
<p>Though I hate to break the news:  If this ever got to SCOTUS, I bet they&rsquo;ll just declare that aspect of the way the law used to be unconstitutional, therefore Obama is a citizen.</p>

She makes the point that even if BO had been born in Hawaii, the issue is with his father&rsquo;s citizenship, and his stepfather&rsquo;s citizenship.  If he was adopted by his Indonesian stepfather, he had Indonesian citizenship.  I mean, there are a few angles to this, but what it all boils down to is, Obama is not qualified to be president.</p>
<p>There is even doubt of McCain&rsquo;s citizenship for what that&rsquo;s worth, since he was born in Panama or something like that.</p>

<p>You lack the ability to see this objectively because you judge Obama within a blackworld context. If Bush had written books charged with even one single racial shard, he would have been cast a drooling southerner-bigot.</p>

<p>John Sidney McCain III was born in the Panama Canal Zone, a U.S. territory at the time.  But even if he was born outside of American territory, both of his parents were American citizens, so he is automatically once.  If he would have won the election and some lib would have taken the issue to the courts, I can ill imagine that the Federal judiciary would have turned away a POW, whose father and grandfather were very high up Admirals in the Navy.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t whether Obama is a U.S. Citizen but whether he is a &#8220;Natural Born Citizen&#8221; per Article II, Section I of the Constitution.  NBC is a higher standard than mere &#8220;Citizen&#8221; and is a requirement solely for the office of the Presidency.  The spirit of the NBC clause was to prevent any chance of dual allegiances.</p>
<p>If you read <a href="https://naturalborncitizen.wordpress.com/2008/12/11/natural-born-citizen-defined-by-14th-amendment-framers-and-in-treatise-relied-on-by-scalia/ " rel="nofollow">Vattel&rsquo;s Law of Nations</a>, which our Founders relied heavily upon to draft the Constitution, NBC means born on U.S. soil to two U.S. citizen parents at time of birth.</p>
<p>Fightthesmears.com, Obama&rsquo;s citizenship vetting website during the campaign, has stated the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.&lsquo;s children.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a moot point whether or not Obama Jr. was physically born in Hawaii.  </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s father is a British subject (per the Obama campaign).</p>
<p>Hence Obama Jr. cannot be a NBC and thus is unqualified to be POTUS.<br>

[re. McCain and Panama]  Doesn&rsquo;t the Constitution say born in the United States? Would a territory even count?<br>
Moot point, but still worth thinking about.<br>
  &mdash;   Alexandra <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
It&rsquo;s complex and I don&rsquo;t know the answers, but I could point out that: </p>
<p>1. The USA had no [overseas] territories at the time the Constitution was written.  (True, we did have the Northwest Territory, and then the Louisiana Territory.  Babies born there were not considered foreigners or excluded from US citizenship).<br>
2. The Canal Zone was under US admistration, virtually a part of the US itself,  and was quite different from Panama. There were many American personnal stationed there and surely many babies born there. I can&rsquo;t believe those babies were excluded from citizenship, or even had their citizenship questioned. <br>
3. Hawaii was itself a Territory, as are Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands at present.  Their populations are all US citizens. </p>
<p>As for Obama, even if it could be proven that he&rsquo;s not technically, under the law,  a US citizen,  I doubt that anything would come of it.  It&rsquo;s too late now.  How do you unmake a sitting president?   There would  be riots, civil discord.  It simply wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to happen.  As someone above said, the Supreme Court would refuse to hear it.  Or Congress would pass some kind of special exemption. SOMETHING would be done to get around that sticky law, because otherwise the country would be torn apart.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see this challange to Obama going far, because if it didn&rsquo;t get anywhere BEFORE he was elected, it certainly isn&rsquo;t going anywhere now that he&rsquo;s installed in the White House.</p>
<p>The only exception that I can see might be if some scandal or gross incompetence arises that would turn the public massively against him, and thus they&rsquo;d be looking for an  excuse to get him out.</p>

Barack Obama is also a citizen. Citizen or not is NOT the issue. The constitution says that to be president you have to have been BORN in America. Arnold Swatzenegger is a citizen but he was not born in America so he cannot be president.</p>
<p>That is the issue with Obama. Not whether or not he is a citizen but rather where he was born. As I said, the McCain issue is moot as a Navy base IS American!</p>

		<p>Does anyone else find it odd that in the year Obama runs and wins his opponent just happened to be a man who also had, because of his birth in the Panama canal zone, some question as to his status as a naturalized citizen.  I have read this clause and find it less than clear.  It seems to me that not only did the Republicans throw the election this year but that they also provided cover for Obama&rsquo;s own questionable eligibility to hold the office of POTUSA.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wake up people, both current political parties are bought and paid for by the same global elitist powers.  We do not have representation in this nation&rsquo;s governance.  Furthermore there is no &#8220;conservative&#8221; party in the USA.  Both the Republicans and the Democrats are socialist statist parties, both are going down the same hallway.  The Democrats are just walking on the left side of the hallway and the Republicans are walking on the right.  </p>
<p>Under both parties the government grows larger, our sovereignty as a nation diminishes, our Constitution is ignored and marginalized and our hard won individual freedoms are assaulted and violated.  The real cost of electing Obama is that it provides great encouragement to the non-whites and their socialist enablers in this nation who continue to undermine it by every means possible to them.  Obama&rsquo;s disastorous &#8220;stimulus&#8221; bill only serves to funnel billions more of borrowed and counterfeited dollars to the same anti-American groups who got him elected in the first place.</p>
<p>Anyway having one race traitor, American hating, silly mother may qualify him for the presidency of the current &#8220;United&#8221; Socialist Republic of American but it sure doesn&rsquo;t give him any moral authority over me.</p>

		<p>If obama is a native-born American citizen, he should have a &#8220;consular birth certificate&#8221; issued by the American embassy in his country of birth (kenya).  This confers all the benefits of native-born citizenship.

That is only a superficial view that misses what&rsquo;s beneath the surface.  You&rsquo;re paying too much attention to Obama, as if he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s actually running things all by himself, while ignoring his string of handlers and manipulators  who keep to the background. </p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, he&rsquo;s only a public front   &mdash;    as most presidents have been for a long while now.

<p>Others call him a puppet controlled by his behind-the-scenes handlers.  Obama is incapable of fomenting a coherent thought himself and must rely on a script written for him on a teleprompter.</p>
<p>I do not believe for a second obama is smart enough or organized enough to have pulled off what he did, especially as an unknown, without A LOT of outside help and money (big money).  His handlers played him up brilliantly with tons of help from the lapdogs in the biased msm  &mdash;  any scintilla of criticism is instantly, loudly denounced in the msm as blatant racism  &mdash;   targeting, attacking and shutting up the critics (ask Rush).  Even the political cartoonists are cringing in fear of &#8216;offending&rsquo; obama and being slapped with the racist label.</p>
<p>Obama is a perfect front man for the hostile elites  &mdash;  and the msm won&rsquo;t allow YOU to scratch the surface, because there&rsquo;s nothing underneath this empty suit.</p>
<p>Better to have the entire ecomony destroyed than criticize the first black president (but wasn&rsquo;t that the plan all along?).</p>

<p>That &#8216;some professor&rsquo; you refer to is the brilliant Professor Jack Cashill.  I own most of his wonderful books  &mdash;  &#8216;Hoodwinked&rsquo; and &#8216;What&rsquo;s the Matter With California&rsquo; sit on my special bookshelf of most favored books.

<p>From the book description:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;For a century, &#8216;progressive&rsquo; writers and filmmakers-multiculturalists like Ward Churchill and Alex Haley, sexual revolutionaries like Kinsey and Margaret Mead, quasi-Marxists like Noam Chomsky and Michael Moore, and radical naturalists like Paul Ehrlich and Rachel Carson&hellip;.

		<p>Obamas mental status needs to be questioned. He has more love for the black father who abandoned him then he does for the white mother and white grandparents who raised him. If he were 100% black, he would not be P{resident. The fact they his campaign commercials showed his white grandparents was to put white voters at ease.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: Doesn&rsquo;t the Constitution say born in the United States? Would a territory even count?</p>
<p>Moot point, but still worth thinking about.<br>
Posted by Alexandra </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moot point, and a very interesting one.  It would really have to be further defined.  Does it mean under the jurisdiction of the United States, or physically IN one of the United  States? That needs clarification, as the US at that time did not have overseas territories and bases around the world. </p>
<p>It would take some research, but I would ask were there any presidents   &mdash;   someone from the frontier, such as Andrew Jackson or  Lincoln (just grasping at straws here)  &mdash;   born in an actual state or in what was then a territory? Did the issue ever come up before?</p>
<p>And, as has been made clear by some posters here, the fundamental issue is not (completely) whether O. is a citizen, (even assuming he is), but WHERE he was born. Or rather, what is a &#8220;natural born citizen&#8221;?  (Does being a &#8220;natural born US citizen&#8221; mean being born INSIDE the USA?) And are TWO American parents necessary for this requirement?   </p>
<p>That term, natural born, is very troublesome and desperately needs clear defining.  Given the global commitments of the the present United States, plus the ease and commonness of travel today, it&rsquo;s likely the question will come up again.</p>

		<p>Whether BHO was born in Hawaii or Mombasa, Kenya (the latter supported by overwhelming evidence) is not even the issue, really. It is the fact that he was adopted by Lolo Soetoro and was thus a citizen of Indonesia for a number of years. Dual citizenship is forbidden by the Constitution.</p>
<p>Additionally, BHO&rsquo;s father, who was indeed born in Kenya, was a British subject. BHO was ineligible for the Oval Office the second he was born. And he knows it. </p>
<p>Any other man (and the word might not apply to BHO) would have quelled the concerns of half the nation by producing the appropriate documentation. That he has sealed all of his records and taken legal action to keep them sealed says a great deal about him, Pelosi, the Clintons, and the entire worthless democrat party, who no doubt are well aware of his ineligibility. Apparently they were determined to seat a minority in the White House regardless. </p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t comprehend the sealing of his university records, it is likely because they indicate he was a FOREIGN student and receiving FOREIGN student financial aid.</p>
<p>To the starry-eyed nuts who voted for him, none of this will matter. To AMERICANS, it will not go away.</p>

<p>That is true. There is no definition of NBC within the text of the Constitution.  As such, it ultimately falls on SCOTUS to make the call. The Court has been only comfortable punting on the NBC issue to date.</p>
<p>An analysis of the orginal intent of the Founders is required.  Vattel&rsquo;s Law of Nations is the key:</p>
<p>&#8220;§ 212. Citizens and natives.</p>
<p>The citizens are the members of the civil society; bound to this society by certain duties, and subject to its authority, they equally participate in its advantages. <b>The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country, of parents who are citizens.</b> As the society cannot exist and perpetuate itself otherwise than by the children of the citizens, those children naturally follow the condition of their fathers, and succeed to all their rights. The society is supposed to desire this, in consequence of what it owes to its own preservation; and it is presumed, as matter of course, that each citizen, on entering into society, reserves to his children the right of becoming members of it. The country of the fathers is therefore that of the children; and these become true citizens merely by their tacit consent. We shall soon see whether, on their coming to the years of discretion, they may renounce their right, and what they owe to the society in which they were born. I say, that, in order to be of the country, it is necessary that a person be born of a father who is a citizen; for, if he is born there of a foreigner, it will be only the place of his birth, and not his country.&#8221;</p>

<p>It needs clarification right now more than ever   &mdash;   not only because of Obama himself but, looking forward to the future, if the matter is allowed to rest now, then he will set a precedent in this matter; and in future the &#8220;natural born citizen&#8221; requirement will be, to all effects, null and void.</p>
<p>In fact, for some while now. this&#8221;natural-born&#8221;  issue has been a stumbling block, an annoyance,  that certain  anti-nativist  elements have been concerned about getting removed or nullified.   But that would require a constitutional amendment.  This Obama case would be a perfect way of getting around that inconvenient clause   &mdash;    simply by establishing a precedent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As for Obama, even if it could be proven that he&rsquo;s not technically a US citizen, I doubt that anything would come of it. It&rsquo;s too late now. How do you unmake a sitting president? &hellip; the Supreme Court would refuse to hear it, or come up with a novel interpretation. Or Congress would pass some kind of special, retroactive exemption. I don&rsquo;t see this challange to Obama going far, because if it didn&rsquo;t get anywhere BEFORE he was elected, it certainly isn&rsquo;t going anywhere AFTER he&rsquo;s already installed in the White House.<br>
 <br>
The only exception that I can see might be if some scandal or gross incompetence arises that would turn the public massively against him, thus they&rsquo;d be looking for an excuse to get him out.&#8221;<br>

<p>That too, seems unlikely   &mdash;   highly unlikely   &mdash;   because the media, as well as certain powerful elements  (the pro-miscegenation, one-world, multi-culty crowd)  will go to ANY lengths to cover for him and get him off the hook.  He represents too big an investment on their part, all their hopes and dreams, and they can&rsquo;t afford to lose that.  They have all their chips placed on this one.  He&rsquo;s their big chance and they can&rsquo;t let him blow it.</p>

Duel citizenship is forbidden by the Constitution?  Oh?  Really?  That sounds like an excellent idea to me.  I only wish it were so!  But apparently that fine  point has escaped notice thus far.  </p>
<p>You would have to explain it to a lot of people.  You could start with Rahm Emanuel, President Obama&rsquo;s White House Chief of Staff.    And that&rsquo;s just for starters.   </p>
<p>If there is such a prohibition, apparently it&rsquo;s a dead issue.<br>

Thank you for your useful information in this matter.  <br>
However, as I read the above, if I understand it correctly, the possession of citizenship (or non-citizenship), as described,  would be a permanent condition,  in perpetuity, one not consonant with present realities in the USA.</p>
<p>If your parents had to be BORN citizens in order for you to be born a citizen, then their parents would also have had to be born citizens, and their parents, and theirs,  etc. </p>
<p>Perhaps this was an adequate rule for ancient countries in the Old World where birth alone determined citizenship;  but in a new country such as the USA,  the receptor of many immigrants, there would have to be some point established at which one BECOMES a citizen, even if born of non-citizen parents  (other than naturalization).  </p>
<p>Thus, the above definition is deficient or inadequate for the United States of America. (I presume it was written from a European standpoint, and primarily for Europeans?)</p>

		<p>Emmerich de Vattel was a Swiss philosopher and legal expert who died in 1767.  He never heard of the USA. He never heard of the steamship or the airplane.  His masterpiece, The Law of Nations, was written in 1758   &mdash;    three decades before the United States of America even existed.  It not only preceded the age of revolution, it long preceded the age of immigration, hence on some points it is a bit out of touch with the modern world.</p>
