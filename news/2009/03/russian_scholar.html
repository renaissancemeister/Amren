<h1>Russian Scholar Says U.S. Will Collapse Next Year</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Eckel, AP, March 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you&rsquo;re inclined to believe Igor Panarin, and the Kremlin wouldn&rsquo;t mind if you did, then President Barack Obama will order martial law this year, the U.S. will split into six rump-states before 2011, and Russia and China will become the backbones of a new world order.</p>
<p>Panarin might be easy to ignore but for the fact that he is a dean at the Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s school for future diplomats and a regular on Russia&rsquo;s state-guided TV channels. And his predictions fit into the anti-American story line of the Kremlin leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010,&#8221; Panarin told dozens of students, professors and diplomats Tuesday at the Diplomatic Academy  &mdash;  a lecture the ministry pointedly invited The Associated Press and other foreign media to attend.</p>
<p>The prediction from Panarin, a former spokesman for Russia&rsquo;s Federal Space Agency and reportedly an ex-KGB analyst, meshes with the negative view of the U.S. that has been flowing from the Kremlin in recent years, in particular from Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he said the recent economic turmoil in the U.S. and other &#8220;social and cultural phenomena&#8221; led him to nail down a specific timeframe for &#8220;The End&#8221;  &mdash;  when the United States will break up into six autonomous regions and Alaska will revert to Russian control.</p>
<p>Panarin argued that Americans are in moral decline, saying their great psychological stress is evident from school shootings, the size of the prison population and the number of gay men.</p>
<p>Turning to economic woes, he cited the slide in major stock indexes, the decline in U.S. gross domestic product and Washington&rsquo;s bailout of banking giant Citigroup as evidence that American dominance of global markets has collapsed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Panarin insisted he didn&rsquo;t wish for a U.S. collapse, but he predicted Russia and China would emerge from the economic turmoil stronger and said the two nations should work together, even to create a new currency to replace the U.S. dollar.</p>

			<p>The fact that neither Russia or Red China manufactures a world class automobile for export speaks volumes about how far behind the West, Japan and Korea they are.  Russia collapsed years ago and Red China is next in line&hellip; </p>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible in time, but I think a Russian scholar has an ulterior motive in predicting the eminent demise of the U.S.A.   &mdash;   because he wants it, because he&rsquo;s jealous about American pressure to end the Soviet Empire.  And a weaker America necessarily means a stronger Russia.</p>

			<p>I believe some of the specifics of Panarin&rsquo;s predictions - as noted by American Renaissance members last time this came up - are, outside the basic principles of widespread secession and martial law, are incorrect:<br>
Even if Russia manages to cling on to superpower status (with a rising Muslim minority along with growing support for &#8220;far-Right&#8221; parties and groups), wasn&rsquo;t Panarin proposing an independant &#8220;Republic of Texas&#8221; and other social absurdities?</p>

			<p>Russia and China are natural adversaries.  Russia has Siberia, and China wants it.  Russia and the U.S. had a political rivalry, the Cold War, but there&rsquo;s no reason today that we can&rsquo;t be allies.  I never give much credibility to any Chinese-Russian friendship story, I just regard it as propaganda aimed at taking the U.S. down a notch.  </p>

			<p>I remember reading several years ago that the North American Union (the forcible merger of the United States with Canada and Mexico) was supposed to start taking place in 2010, at least the initial stages. </p>
<p>   And what do you know, we now have a serious economic crisis conveniently taking place one year before. No doubt it will continue to get a lot worse and we will then be told that we &#8220;must&#8221; join the North American Union if we don&rsquo;t want the United States to be economically ruined.</p>
<p><br>
   I am convinced that this economic crisis was deliberately planned and is being deliberately carried out just as I am convinced that our borders have been deliberately left open also. </p>
<p><br>
   What bad luck, though, to be joined with Mexico, such a corrupt, violent country. Why couldn&rsquo;t Australia or Switzerland be our southern neighbor?!!</p>

<p>School shootings and the prison population is a problem created by non-whites. He might have a point with the gay thing. Too many White men and women are gay or asexual. But really, this guy is just trying to get headlines for himself. Russia will not seize Alaska unless it is prepared for a fight with a well armed civilian population. As for China and Russia teaming up to basically rule the world I have a feeling many well armed American White Nationalists will have other plans.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t really think his timeline is credible but his analysis will eventually turn out to be correct. And American goofballs think we will be around long enought to be a functioning white minority nation? In future history books, ours will be referred to as the Age of Stupidity.</p>

			<p>We still aren&rsquo;t given a full report of how Panarin reaches his conclusions.  Hitting the highlights, is a trick the US media has always used to denigrate an opinion they disagree with, hoping to make it appear ridiculous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to read his full theory and the data he uses to back it up in order to make a determination as to whether it&rsquo;s a viable concept.  But, we won&rsquo;t get that unless we are able to  read Russian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see martial law this year, but as quickly as things have deteriorated these last several months, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t rule it out.</p>
<p>But, for certain, his final reasoning on the break up of the US is unsound.  It won&rsquo;t occur the way he shows it, and it will be mostly racial, although it will begin as tax revolts, food and job riots.</p>
<p>And the biggest item he isn&rsquo;t taking into consideration is that when the US goes down, so too will the whole world, including China and Japan who are reportedly in worse shape than this country.</p>
<p>It will be a miracle if Mexico exists when the final curtain falls.  It could well end up being the Southern American States of North America, which will be autonomous, just as the Northern Alliance will be, all the way up through and including Canada and Alaska, as one contiguous nation state, made up of several white feudal territories.</p>
<p>Blacks will get a small section in the Southeast, and the Mexes will get pushed further down into the Southern American States, closer to Mexico City than the old US/Mexico border.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only one possible outcome.  There are others, but they all translate to breakup into smaller nation-states, along lines of race and possibly ideology. The lefties just might get to experience a few hovels in the black portion.</p>

			<p>The US isn&rsquo;t going to collapse next year for the simple reason that it has already collapsed.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s finished. Over. Our situation now is similar to that of Italy under the Ostrogoths after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The institutions are the same, but the barbarians are in control.</p>
<p>The situation is irreversible. Whites are going to become a numerical minority a lot sooner than 2045, but it hardly matters because the vast majority of whites have been so dumbed down and brainwashed that they&rsquo;re incapable of looking after their own interests even when they&rsquo;re in the majority. In any case, there isn&rsquo;t time to reverse the demographic or political trends in the time we have left. It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>America was a good idea while it lasted. Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t last very long  &mdash;  a couple of centuries, give or take. Future historians, if there are any, will record that the United States of America, the Greatest Country In The World, lasted about as long as the Seleucid Empire.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take anything these Russian propagandists say too seriously. Notice he mentioned the &#8220;moral decline&#8221; of the US, but he didn&rsquo;t say <i>why</i> it is in decline. No mention of racial strife. No mention of the Hispanic invasion, and the pandering actions of our &#8220;leaders.&#8221; No mention of the symbolic capitulation of electing the first &#8220;black&#8221; president. This propagandist is just as deceived about race as the rest of the world. We&rsquo;re simply reading our own values and beliefs into what he&rsquo;s saying. If he doesn&rsquo;t have a clear understanding of the <i>causes</i> of our problems, then how can he make predictions  based on that lack of understanding?</p>

			<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the US will suffer a major domestic turmoil akin to a civil war.  But what this Russian fails to understand and never will is the American spirit and our resolve.  Sure we are slow to move and often times seem to be asleep at the wheel, but when the time comes we sill awaken and with a force of vengeance and determination unseen since the revolution.</p>
<p>  And should the Russian be correct, the end of the US will mean the end of Russia and China as well.</p>

			<p>Glenn Beck said on Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show, when pressed to do so, that he thought we were going to have a revolution.  </p>
<p>He then dedicated the entire hour of his show a couple of days later to talking about various aspects of a deteriorating US with various experts.  </p>
<p>On the below show via the links, Beck obviously truly believes we are headed for break up, but he&rsquo;s holding back, because if he came right out and fully expressed his true feelings he probably would lose his show and would be highly criticized by the MSM for employing scare tactics.  Notice that he is quick to cut off Gerald Celente when Celente really gets into the meat of the matter.  He can&rsquo;t be blamed for doing so, because he can&rsquo;t go too far without running into trouble.  But just the degree to which he ventured in a chaotic scenario is far, far greater than what anybody with a T.V. show has had the guts to do, so he deserves considerable credit for that.</p>

			<p>He is essentially right in his assessment of moral decline, psychological stress, and economic collapse, but here is why I don&rsquo;t think the U.S. will break up any time soon.  </p>
<p>The break up would have to be initiated by whites, and because most whites have been traumatized psychologically by the PC rulers, they lack the will to fight.  </p>
<p>Blacks, for all their bluster and constant agitation against whites, still desire integration with whites because it brings them economic advantages. Blacks are well aware of what happens when they are left to their own devices: Detroit, Haiti, Zimbabwe etc.  Blacks definitely want to be around whites, even as they agitate us to no end.  Black nationalist can have segregation anytime they want it; they don&rsquo;t need to fight for that.  Whites wont object, in fact, whites would even welcome it.  But whites are never allowed segregation.  There are a host of such double standards.</p>
<p>Latinos could eventually control the Southwest.  Latinos have shown they can and will expel blacks from neighborhoods and cities.  But why would Latinos ever openly declare independence when they can have a de facto independence and still have the advantages of having access to national federal tax dollars.  No, Latinos will continue to make further inroads, but will not try to declare independence for many years to come.</p>
<p>Whites are the losers in this arrangement.  So if there is going to be a breakup any time soon, it would have to be initiated by whites.  Whites are being displaced and have the most to lose as they see their tax dollars used against them in various forms of affirmative action.  Whites have lost control of most major cities.  The only thing keeping the United States together is whites continue to cede more of their freedoms, rights, neighborhoods, and tax dollars without a serious fight.  When whites take a stand and demand representation from their politicians the way blacks and Latinos do, or when they take a stand and defend cities and neighborhoods like Latinos do, that is when the United STates will really be in jeopardy of a break up.  But most upper class whites are content to live in a gated enclave, and lower class whites are too busy trying to make ends meet by working a low paying jobs.</p>

			<p>I have mixed feelings.  In some respects, I agree with Anonymous at 7:26 PM on March 4.  I&rsquo;ve witnessed the dumbing down of White America since around 1970, as a consequence of watering down the school and college curricula to accommodate the less intellectually capable members of our society.  The result:  folks who do not know the difference between &#8220;then&#8221; and &#8220;than&#8221;, between &#8220;to&#8221; and &#8220;too&#8221;, between &#8220;it&rsquo;s&#8221; and &#8220;its&#8221; and proper usage of &#8220;they&rsquo;re&#8221; and &#8220;their&#8221; and &#8220;there.&#8221;  There are those who put an apostrophe in the plural and leave it off in the possessive.  You get the picture. Some would say that these are small things, but they are a readily apparent symptom of a serious malady that lies underneath, eating at the will that could uphold the cause of Conservative White America so well.  The lies in revisionist history have poisoned the minds of young whites against their own kind.  If parents don&rsquo;t educate their children in the home and point out those lies with great emphasis, we are doomed.  So, as Anonymous has stated, we&rsquo;ve already collapsed, and this is true in many senses.  The liberals wanted it so, as younger generations no longer have the intellectual prowess to challenge the Reds as they take us down as they&rsquo;ve planned to do all along. </p>
<p>Yet, I hope that there are enough of us who would at least give them a hell of a fight.  We don&rsquo;t have to be geniuses or have a degree from Yale to fight.  As to the partitioning of the USA, I wouldn&rsquo;t want even to venture a guess.  If we do regroup along racial lines, then any attempt at an invasion of the area claimed by Whites would be met rather vigorously by force of arms, as would any invasion by any foreign nation.  Let us pray for peace, but let us also remember the words of Plato that &#8220;only the dead have seen the end of war.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I am an American Economist, also a wealthy investor in the US stock market. I agree with 90% of this article.<br>
With crazy obama at the reigns, the US will have another Great Depression. Unless he is removed, the US is over. If in doubt, consider all of the past historical examples of blacks running a successful government. <br>
I also plan on leaving the US possibly as soon as next year. Most likely, my family will be moving to Europe. I suggest every American gather up what they have and plan on moving as well.<br>
Given the amazingly weak state of the US, in general, I also would not be surprised to see the US overthrown by another power. China, Russia and Iran are all working together now. Who do you think they will oppose ? Good luck to you all.</p>

<p>The black leader will take the next four years to ensure his re-election.</p>
<p>In these eight years enough damage will be done that the white race in America will die off.</p>

			<p>This is a marxist&rsquo;s wishful thinking. All marxists yearn for the destabilization of the American civil order because they are skilled at using the disorder to bring about a change of the economic structure otherwise known as marxism.</p>
<p>Obama is working hard to destabilize the American civil order. There are millions of marxists (democrats) waiting impatiently to take advantage of the confusion and bring about their dream of a communist America.</p>
<p>Some would say that the disorder has already begun.</p>

So true.   I agree with ALL of anonymous&rsquo; other comments, except possibly this:   <i>&#8220;Blacks are well aware of what happens when they are left to their own devices: Detroit, Haiti, Zimbabwe, etc.&#8221;   </i>  </p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m not so sure about that!    Maybe the smarter ones know, at least deep in their hearts, what happens when they are left on their own.  But  dare they admit it?  For most of them, I think their pride forbids them to recognize and face what is otherwise so obvious to everyone else.  They have a million justifications for their failures and their universal backwardness, but NEVER anything to do with race.  Certainly not with THEIR race, that is!   If their failures are connected in any way with race,  it&rsquo;s all due to greedy whites and  &#8220;systemic white racism&#8221;.  Blah, blah.  We&rsquo;ve heard it all before.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you, except I&rsquo;d say maybe 15 or 20  (another generation, that is)&hellip;  barring some unforseeable major event or calamity that would greatly hasten it.  Right now, the country just isn&rsquo;t ready. We&rsquo;re already thinking about it, we here, but most people aren&rsquo;t. To most, it&rsquo;s still inconceivable.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, one more thing:  In this new national fracture there will also be a Hispanic line  (and maybe others), greatly complicating things. <br>

I hate to say it, but I have an uneasy suspicion that if the US falls apart and is re-grouped along new lines, those lines probably will not be racial: considering how the US public   &mdash;    AS IT NOW STANDS   &mdash;   is so totally brainwashed against any notions about race or any slightest whiff of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  No matter what awful things may happen to them, millions will still howl with outrage:  &#8220;Oh, you can&rsquo;t do that!  You can&rsquo;t segregate them!  That&rsquo;s racist!!!&#8221;   They&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated to believe in integration, miscegenation, and multiculturalism like a religion. It truly IS the new, official state religion   &mdash;   of the USA, and of all the West.</p>
<p>Look at how many times we&rsquo;ve already seen the families of rape or murder victims, exclaiming indignantly, <i><b> &#8220;It had NOTHING to do with race!&#8221;  </b></i> How many times do they babble about <i>&#8220;reaching out&#8221;  </i>and  <i>&#8220;healing&#8221;</i>?  And all the other fashionable, hackneyed jargon that they have been taught to parrot. (These terms, &#8220;reaching out&#8221; and &#8220;healing&#8221;   &mdash;    really mean making apologies and groveling on the part of whites and offering more concessions to blacks.)  How many times do they become lovey-dovey friends with the families of the killers?  All of this  just to show that they are not &#8220;racists&#8221; and that they do not &#8220;hate&#8221;.   How very virtuous of them!   Their own family members are sacrificed on the altar of the greater good:   inter-racial love and harmony, all in the name of integration and multi-culturalism, which we have been taught MUST be achieved at any cost.</p>
<p>Maybe that will change in the future, but  it will take time (and much re-educating) for people to wake up.  It remains to be seen.  But not while the present propaganda machine remains in operation!   After half a century of incessant school and  media brainwashing, the present generation, most of it, is probably lost.  They will always have a guilty knee-jerk reaction to &#8220;racism&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s been drilled into their heads. They were raised on it. It&rsquo;s become part of them.   The election of Obama being proof of it.</p>
<p>Please prove me wrong!  I want to be wrong about this.</p>

			<p>We should target some African countries for immigration (preferably Angola, Nambia, Equaltorial Gunea, Gabon) and take their place once america has fallen. We will have enough oil, gold, diamonds, and other important material for building a succesful nation that they dont take advantage of. Then we could start farming communties and build a long border wall. There is plentity of room for us to have as many as babies as we want. Maybe we could build a superior large military we could over take more of their land.</p>
<p>If only had our ancestors taken over africa and did to them what we did to the INDIANS it would be absolutely perfect. Not Northern Africa but central and sourthern africa. We would have all the minerals and other things Africans dont use that would make us extremely rich (more than we are now). We could rewrite a new better constitution, a better set of laws, welfare reform, better education, and a better immigration policy. As we watch America fall into chaos on t.v. while sipping wine in our new living rooms. </p>
<p>This should be our main goal, to take over Africa and make it a new homeland while they take over North America think they could run it better than we can. We could take revenge on that MUGABE and rescue are brethern.</p>

			<p>  We&rsquo;re in deep trouble. There is no doubt about that. Whether we follow the progression outlined by Gerald Celente in his Trends magazine? I can only guess. Mr. Celente mentioned he owned an SKS carbine and plenty of ammo in one interview. I don&rsquo;t think the controlled media interviewer liked either Mr. Celente or his comments. Mr. Celente has on occasion come very close to commenting on racial issues, but pulled back or was cut off.   </p>
<p>I suspect the country will take longer to implode than predicted. It may be a few years before the hyperinflation really gets going, and as Robert Kelly and others have predicted it will fall apart, but I think very gradually not all at once. <br>

<p>AJ, I have no animosity towards Russia. Are they our natuaral ally? Yes and no. The Russians are first and foremost Russian Nationalists. Is there a White Nationalist element to that? Maybe a small one in some very extreme circles/groups in Russia. Could these individuals/groups be our allies. I think so. And just because they are very extreme does not mean that they do not have representatives in Parliament, because they do. But these people would have to be convinced that becoming the allies of American White Nationalists would be in their best interest and that is no easy task. America getting the hell out of the Caucases and the Middle East and not pointing missles at Russia from Poland would go along way towards bettering our relationship. But Alas, a mulatto race hustler is in charge, not well intentioned White Nationalists.</p>

			<p>As late as January, 1945, many working class and farm owning Prussians thought that they would be able to stay behind in Prussia, and that life would go on pretty much as before.  After all, Germans had lived in that area of Europe for 1000 years, and there had been many, many previous wars that did not uproot the German population.  However, the Russians arrived with a mandate to ethnically cleanse Prussia and replace the Germans with the Poles.  Within weeks they had killed tens of thousands of German civilians, and had the rest of the German civilians running for their lives.  Within two years after WWII ended, many MILLIONS of Germans had been cleared out of Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia, and areas of Poland and the Baltic states where they had lived for generations, and the Prussian towns and cities, streets and parks had been renamed with Polish names.  It was meant to be as though the Germans had NEVER been there.  My point here is that it took only about a month for the bulk of the population to go from optimistic about the future of Russian rule, to terrified.</p>
<p>If there is a &#8220;race war&#8221; in the USA, there is no real reason to think that the country will necessarily be divided into pieces for each different ethnic group.  It is just as likely that if one group is winning that that group will go for total victory with all traces of the enemy ethnic group wiped out.  I personally don&rsquo;t think that the Hispanics, for all their &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; talk would fight to the death to hang on to the Southwest.  I think a big majority would go back to their ancestral homes in Mexico, hunker down for the duration, with the intention of moving back when the hostilities were over.  Ditto with the Asians   &mdash;   they would spend the war years back in China or Korea, or maybe in Hawaii.  Their sons are very special, and with few exceptions, will NOT be participating in any war, civil or foreign, that America is involved with.</p>
<p>My guess would be that the &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; of blacks would try to cut a separate deal for themselves, rather than try to lead their people in the fight to the death against whitey.  Whether or not whitey would be interested would probably depend entirely on how the war was going.</p>
<p>The &#8220;whiter&#8221; Mexicans might also try to cut a deal.  Once again, the success of this would probably be based on what sorts of atrocities had been committed, etc.</p>
<p>If things get bad enough to cause a race war, the side that is winning is going to want the sort of victory that will be permanent, or at least very long term, not just different zones for different races that will lead to renewed calls for immigration to fill job vacancies within a few years after the war ends.  As more and more soldiers and civilians die, people will be less willing to compromise.  They will want their loved one&rsquo;s death to have some sort of meaning.  </p>
<p>Maybe the blacks AND the Mexicans would get pushed into Mexico.</p>

<p>The early Americans were set upon by murderous Indians whose main aim was to steal their livestock, blankets and whatever other meager assets they owned.  </p>

<p>It was a fatal mistake for them, because they were defeated in war and beaten back to areas where they could be watched so they couldn&rsquo;t commit any more atrocities.</p>

			<p>There are some things I forgot to mention.</p>
<p>The world needs America more than America needs the world! FAR MORE!<br>
America consumes 25% of the world&rsquo;s produce which means vertually the whole world depends on it&rsquo;s consumption. The present crisis proves just how much the world depends on the US.<br>
If all else fails, America has the resources to conduct a completely selfsustaing economy in what concers food, energy and most other things and live fine while doing so. I don&rsquo;t know of any other country in the world that can do that! Not even the richest countries in the world. <br>
On the other hand, the world needs a lot of what America exports.</p>
<p>And to the &#8220;American economist&#8221; who plans to flee to Europe - I suggest you read a little about what is happening in Western Europe. You might actually change your mind. Western Europe is dying not very slowly but surely - economically, politically and culturally. The Islamic takeover is just gaining speed now but it will get a lot worse and Europe is going to be a bloody battleground pretty soon because I don&rsquo;t see the Europeans putting up with it for long. Whether they will succeed or not I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s going to get very tough and very ugly there.</p>
<p>As they say, you can run but you can&rsquo;t hide and Europe is definitely not the desired refuge.</p>

Very good point.  I&rsquo;m reluctant to say it, and some people will rush to call me a communist (which I am not) but the present free-wheeling capitalistic structure of American business will always and inevitably seek cheaper and cheaper labor in order to maximize greater and greater profits.  Also, it will seek perpetual &#8220;growth&#8221;, as if  unlimited growth is an unquestioned good in itself. </p>
<p>Therefore, when peace is established and things quiet down, the business elements will soon be right back at it again, agitating for &#8220;guest workers&#8221; or whatever convenient label they might use, in order  to bring in cheaper workers and drive down American wages. It&rsquo;s the nature of the system.  It&rsquo;s built in.  </p>
<p>In a hundred years (or maybe much less) we&rsquo;d have the same situation all over again. And the young generation, having known only prosperity and peace, could be convinced that their grandparents were just a bunch of  bigoted old fogies who were not &#8220;enlightened&#8221; and progressive about these things.  Haven&rsquo;t we seen it all before?</p>

<p>That is a good point, and it makes sense. Obviously, it was to the whites&rsquo;  interest to &#8220;get along&#8221; with their neighbors and have peace   &mdash;    if only because there were so few of them and the Indians were so many. So the whites would not have been violent or aggressive, unless they were forced to be so in self-defense.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Keep in mind that the white man COULD HAVE WIPED OUT THE TRIBES COMPLETELY, BUT <i>CHOSE </i>NOT TO DO SO.

sam d</p>
<p>That is another excellent point. The Indians were renowned for being utterly merciless in warfare, making no exceptions for age or gender. There were cases of entire tribes being exterminated by other tribes: as the Eries in Ohio were by the Iroquois, for instance.  And the Mohicans and Delaware were very nearly all wiped out; and the Hurons, Ottawas, and Algonquins in Canada as well.  Whites, if defeated, would not have fared any better. </p>
<p>In fact, that may well be the case of the first Viking settlements in North America which appear to have vanished without a trace. Their numbers were very few and very likely they were simply overwhelmed and exterminated.</p>

			<p>Excellent points, Anonymous at 9:52 PM.  I find it ridiculous to think that Orientals or Hindus with ties to their Asian homelands would man the barricades with their Mexican, Black, and White liberal comrades.  In the event of serious racial conflict, they would fight bravely to cover their withdrawal to the airport.  I don&rsquo;t mean that slightingly, I mean that they are not about to get caught up in a fight for a land that is not theirs.  They may value their property, but not the country that it happens to be in.   Ask yourself, how many Americans fought to the end to keep the NVA out of Saigon?  And Blacks and Mexicans won&rsquo;t stick up for each other either.  Any racial struggle would be between aware Whites and a collection of mutually mistrustful minorities.  I would also expect liberal Whites to largely stand aside, or flee to whatever country would have them.  Close exposure to minorities under stressful conditions would dissuade many of them from casting their lot with the losing side, and they are not the sort of people to fight for honor anyway.  <br>
     I agree that a lot of Mexicans would go back home too, but there are a good number who would fight.  After all, they fight each other, they fight Blacks, they&rsquo;d not be averse to fighting Whites.  But those who would fight to stay would still be at too great a disadvantage to hold any territory.  If the CSA couldn&rsquo;t stop the Yankees and their technological superiority, how could Mexicans, ignorant, short-sighted, and isolated in bario towns scattered across the barren southwest, stop any White force determined to recover our territory?  And their racial and linguistic differences from us would prevent them from infiltrating anyplace where Whites were willing to keep them out.  <br>
     Blacks are to an army what bread crumbs are to meatloaf: filler.  Their talented &#8220;tenth&#8221; would no doubt try to cut a deal, but in the event of serious racial struggle, there won&rsquo;t be any liberals in charge to deal with.  They are as doomed as the rest.  In every society, Blacks are on the bottom, and without the White left to prop them up, there they&rsquo;ll stay.  <br>
     As cruel as the War Between the States got by 1864, when it was over, the two sides could reconcile.  Were it not for the Radical Republicans utopian hatred that began long before the war, the healing would have come even sooner.  There were ethnic differences between the two sides, more Germans in the North, more Celtic people in the South, but there was more in common than not.  And the Yankees were not out to actually displace anyone, to drive Alabamans into Georgia or something.  The war was really as pointless and tragic as WW1.  But any civil struggle that might come to the U.S. would be much harsher.  There are real grievances, real antagonisms, real blood debts to pay.  I agree with Anonymous, if the ball starts rolling, there will be no compromise.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think that corporate capitalism will have much of a future in any post-multiculturalist America, Browser.  The businessmen who have exploited us won&rsquo;t fare any better than the politicians and intellectuals.  I have no doubt that the worst of them already have their guarded estates overseas.  White people wanting to know why we had to endure such suffering will be no more willing to tolerate white traitors than non-White invaders.  Furthermore, any mass struggle will likely be a consequence of the gross mishandling of the economy, and even greater poverty would follow the struggle.  Whites will be ready for serious political and economic restructuring, and that will not include economic globalism.</p>

			<p>I think the blacks would be more likely to put up a formal fight, because they don&rsquo;t have any other &#8220;homeland,&#8221; while the Mexicans and Central Americans do.  Blacks would NOT see returning to Africa as an option, indeed, I don&rsquo;t think that any African country would offer them refuge.  American blacks are perceived by African blacks as spoiled.  </p>
<p>If the blacks were pushed into a separate geographical area while the war continued, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if there were a humanitarian debacle within six months   &mdash;   cholera, typhus, babies with swollen bellies, etc.  Food rationing and other wartime measures are typical for white countries, and maybe also for Asian countries, but I don&rsquo;t think that the blacks would trust each other enough to put together a workable plan to allocate scarce materials, even during wartime.  The blacks in New Orleans didn&rsquo;t even help each other get out of the danger zone.  </p>
<p>In contrast, many, many &#8220;Aztlaners&#8221; would be content to sit out the war in Mexico.  If Aztlan wins a chunk of America, they will quickly cross the border and pretend that they fought in every battle, kind of like all those millions of members of the French resistance in WWII.  If Aztlan does not win a chunk of America, they will simply hope that things will go back to business as usual after a year or two, and that they will be able to be nannies and gardeners just like in the good old days.  The illegals are convinced that whitey cannot get by without nannies and gardeners, but when the economy falls apart, or if you lose your job, domestic workers are the first luxury to go.  </p>
<p>Illegal aliens have larger-than-average families when they come to America, based on having access to various American social welfare programs.  If the illegals are suddenly shoved back over the border, there will be starvation and civil war there as well.  In fact, it looks like the Mexican civil war may start years ahead of our own.</p>

President Obama, like former President Bush, is not by any stretch of the imagination, calling the shots in this nation. This is a totally naive view and as ghw points out so very correctly, that the rich, well-connected and influential people in this nation and in the world, are not going to allow any single individual determine the course of their lives, whether his title is dicatator or President. My father used to say long ago, money is the governor of the world. Those who have control of massive amounts of it, call the shots, anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>You need to look at the evil and hateful whites who wanted to steal the land and property of Indians who made peace with their defeat like the Cherokee to realize that there was alot of undeserved hate on the part of whites as well. Look at Andrew Jackson and his unconstitutional Indian removal Act. The Bureau of Indian affairs and its agents who stole from the Indians. Please, lets realize they had a claim to the land and they were fighting to keep it in the way they traditionally fought. As much as I am a white racialist, I respect the position of the Indians in trying to retain their homelands and culture against an overwhelming force.</p>

			<p>True, Browser, Whites would have a real hard time infiltrating among Hispanics, but I don&rsquo;t see much need to.  And you&rsquo;re also right, there are some among them who are White, really indistinguishable from us, but just not that many.  There are millions of young ones who speak only Spanglish, they are fluent in neither English nor Spanish.  And there are certain foreign characteristics of speech that even many non-Spanish speaking, college educated Hispanics have.  <br>
     I think that Whites who would side with the invaders are not, as a rule, the most ferocious of warriors.  Mostly a bunch of people who don&rsquo;t want to mow their own lawn or clean their own house, people who, if they get any exercise, get it at the gym.  Working class America is not howling for amnesty.  White liberals would be right behind the Chinese and Indians at the airports.  There are some true-believing White leftists, but I think the most dangerous Whites would be careerist military officers.   <br>

			<p>&#8220;You need to look at the evil and hateful whites who wanted to steal the land and property of Indians who made peace with their defeat like the Cherokee to realize that there was alot of undeserved hate on the part of whites as well. &hellip; Please, lets realize they had a claim to the land and they were fighting to keep it in the way they traditionally fought.&#8221;<br>

I have no argument with you.  Whites were not saints.  What I was referring to (and I believe the other poster as well) was the situation that existed at the BEGINNING of white settlement, not as it was two or more centuries later when the tables had turned and whites had become more numerous than Indians. </p>
<p>Yes, Indians Fought the only way they knew, and the only way the had always fought, even with each other. Likewise, so did whites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I think that Whites who would side with the invaders are not, as a rule, the most ferocious of warriors. Mostly a bunch of people who don&rsquo;t want to mow their own lawn or clean their own house.&#8221; <br>

True, but those white subverters that I had in mind were the kind who ALWAYS fund, aid, support, sponsor, assist EVERY kind of revolutionary movement, in EVERY way they can.  They need not necessarily offer military support (and very rarely do); they get others to do that for them.  But the results of their actions upon a society can be devastating nonetheless (as we have vividly seen over the last 40 years of social disintegration, otherwise called &#8220;racial progress&#8221;).</p>

			<p><i>Russians are great people, and they were the first victims of an ideology borne in the sick minds of foreigners. </i></p>
<p>Can you please elaborate? Who were these &#8216;foreigners?&rsquo; You can&rsquo;t blame blacks or Asians - not enough of them around in 1917 Russia. So please be clear. What race or ethnicity or tribe are you referring to when you speak of &#8216;foreigners?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seems Russians themselves do not widely accept the view they were victims of the Soviets. In fact there seems to be a bit of nostalgia for the Soviet past - the Russian national anthem is just the re-worded Soviet one, and Stalin is viewed quite favorably. The Russians still do not accept the Western version of the Holodomor (perhaps rightly) and get steamed up over any insult, perceived or real, to Soviet war monuments. </p>

<p>These perhaps reflect the views of Putin himself.</p>

<p>I believe that China will be the world&rsquo;s leading power within 10 to 20 years. Russia will perhaps be China&rsquo;s younger brother (it was the other way round in the early 1950s). </p>
<p>The East Wind will prevail over the West Wind.</p>

			<p>I agree with you there, browser, White liberals make up with subversion and betrayal what they lack in courage and fighting prowess.  You know their battle cry?  &#8220;Let&rsquo;s you and him fight!&#8221;  </p>
<p>Anonymous at 9:52, I would place White careerist military officers on the same ethical level as the corporate lackeys who import all the Mexican labor for the meatpacking industry and the HB1 Indians for Silicon Valley.  They are the most dangerous foes we could have because they have F-16s and so forth, not because they are more malignant than their civilian brethren.   </p>

<p>East of North Africa and West of Western Asia and by the way the worldwide economic collapse is turning China into a basketcase.  </p>

Agreed!  They have been reduced to groveling, pandering bureaucrats, worried for their jobs and jockeying for advancement. They will say and do what they are paid to say and do.  For corroboration of that we have only to see the other current thread&hellip;..</p>
<p>&#8220;Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Gary Roughead, released a podcast on the importance of diversity and the Navy&rsquo;s diversity initiatives .&#8221;<br>
<a href="/news/2009/03/cno_releases_di.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/03/cno_releases_di.php</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the military and in the Navy, it&rsquo;s important that we are a diverse organization because we have to represent what I call the face of America,&rdquo; said Roughead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our population changes and the majority-minority percentages change,  we have to reflect that same demographic in our Navy, but at the end of the day&hellip; we&rsquo;re stronger because of the different perspectives and ideas that people bring to bear.&rdquo;<br>
CNO also said the diversity of the Navy has made great progress in recent years.</p>

If I may speak for him, I don&rsquo;t think you quite understand what Patrick is talking about, Mr. Liu.  It&rsquo;s a very interesting use of wording   &mdash;   that possible mis-spelling of &#8220;borne&#8221; (but also perhaps correct).  It could be read variously &hellip; &#8220;born&#8221;, as created  in the minds of certain people in the West, such as Karl Marx.   Or perhaps &#8220;borne&#8221;,  as a deadly virus that was spread among the natives by aliens.    At any rate, you should not take this personally  as a criticism of Orientals, Mr. Liu. There are limits  to clarity,  but  I&rsquo;m sure that was not what he had in mind.   <br>
Also, I  can&rsquo;t believe that  &#8220;China will be the world&rsquo;s leading power within 10 to 20 years&#8221;.  That seems much too soon.  But perhaps beginning in 20-25 years,  and then thereafter. Thirty  &mdash;  forty seems more credible.  Nonetheless, China&rsquo;s amazing growth in recent years has been fantastic. We&rsquo;ll see if they can keep it up. Certainly they don&rsquo;t have to go through the slow, painful process of trial and error, forging the way in industry and science, as we did.  Others developed the Industrial Revolution; now they can just copy it.  They can learn from our mistakes and make rapid progress, because they are merely following in the footsteps of others on a path that has already been cleared.<br>
