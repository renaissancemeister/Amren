			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Phillips, Daily Mail (London), March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The resignation of Michael Nazir-Ali as Bishop of Rochester is a terrible blow, not just for the Church of England but for Britain.</p>
<p>The bishop says he is resigning so that he can work for endangered or beleaguered Christian minorities both abroad and in the UK.</p>
<p>What a shocking rebuke to the church, that he has to leave his post of influence and authority as a bishop in order to carry out the church&rsquo;s core duty to defend its own against attack.</p>
<p>Shocking  &mdash;  but hardly surprising. Across the world, in countries such as Nigeria and Sudan, millions of Christians are being persecuted at the hands of militant Islam, with forced conversions, the burning of churches and widespread violence.</p>
<p>Yet in the face of this global onslaught, the Church of England makes scarcely a peep of protest.</p>
<p>Worse still, when Dr Nazir-Ali warned last year that Islamic extremists had created &#8216;no-go areas&rsquo; across Britain where non-Muslims faced intimidation, he was disowned by his fellow churchmen who all but declared that he was a liar  &mdash;  even though he was telling the truth.</p>
<p><b>Courage</b></p>
<p>For this act of moral courage, he and his family had to be put under police protection, while his own church left him to swing in the wind of bigotry and intimidation.</p>
<p>Dr Nazir-Ali is one of the very few inside the church to make explicit the link between Christian and British values, and to warn publicly that they are being destroyed through the prevailing doctrine of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>That strong voice of protest has never been needed more than it is now. For Christianity in Britain is under attack from all sides.</p>
<p>Last month, the bishop protested that the arrival in Britain of so many from other faiths had led to the closure of chapels, the retrenchment of Christian chaplaincy and the advent of a &#8216;doctrinaire multi-faithism&rsquo;  &mdash;  not through pressure from the incoming minorities, but from British secularists who wanted to destroy Christianity.</p>
<p>That agenda is becoming ever more oppressive. Yesterday, it was revealed that a Christian council worker was suspended for encouraging a terminally ill woman to turn to God. He says he was also told it was inappropriate to &#8216;talk about God&rsquo; with a client and that he should not even say &#8216;God bless&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This follows the case of the nurse who was suspended for offering to pray for an elderly patient&rsquo;s recovery, the Christian who lost her role on an adoption panel because she disapproved of gay adoption, and Christian adoption agencies which lost their public funding because they had the same approach.</p>
<p>With multiculturalism discriminating in favour of all who challenge the established values of this country, it would appear that it is Christians who have become the oppressed minority.</p>
<p>At every level, Christianity is being displaced from its core position in this country&rsquo;s national story. The BBC Director-General, Mark Thompson, sent dog-collars spinning last year when he suggested that the media should treat Islam more sensitively than Christianity.</p>
<p>Now the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has protested to Mr Thompson that the BBC must not ignore its Christian audience. Recently, it sacked its head of religious programmes, Methodist preacher Michael Wakelin.</p>
<p>The emergence of a Muslim as the frontrunner to succeed him, along with the recent appointment of a Sikh to produce Songs Of Praise, has deepened fears within the church that Christianity is being sidelined.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Government is flirting with changing the Act of Settlement so that it no longer &#8216;discriminates&rsquo; against Catholics  &mdash;  for all the world as if the monarchy is a council diversity outreach programme. But Protestantism is a core element of this country&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p><b>Identity</b></p>
<p>No wonder the Queen  &mdash;  as opposed to Prince Charles, who notoriously said he wanted to be not &#8216;Defender of the Faith&rsquo; but &#8216;defender of faith&rsquo;  &mdash;  is reportedly not amused.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s no use Dr Williams squeaking in protest at the BBC when the church&rsquo;s habitual posture towards the onslaught is to sink to its knees with its cassock over its head.</p>
<p>Take for example the proposal by a regular churchgoer that the churches should ring their bells on St George&rsquo;s Day, to proclaim that the Christian element of English identity is in robust health.</p>
<p>Only five out of the church&rsquo;s 44 bishops back the plan while the rest have scuttled for cover. The Bishop of Chester frets about the danger of such &#8216;public displays&rsquo; of confidence, while the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds murmurs faintly: &#8216;I am not sure assertiveness is a Christian value.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such cultural cringe would be comical were it not so tragic. For this is precisely how the church has all but destroyed itself. Instead of asserting its core beliefs against aggressive secularism, it has tried to accommodate its own destroyer.</p>
<p>As a result, it stopped doing God and spirituality and holding the line for Biblical values and mutated instead into a branch of nonjudgmental social work  &mdash;  a kind of Guardian newspaper at prayer. The resulting moral vacuum now threatens not just the church but the nation itself.</p>
<p>Although most people may no longer be churchgoers, Christianity infuses all this country&rsquo;s institutions, traditions and values.</p>
<p>These have been systematically attacked by a secular culture of unlimited self-indulgence and self-destructive behaviour, resulting in the collapse of the married family, rising crime, drug and alcohol abuse and a grievous erosion of the sanctity of human life.</p>
<p>With the church refusing to assert itself, this vacuum has allowed radical Islam to promote itself as an influential force in public life. Indeed it is rubbing its hands at the opportunity. And in the longer term that risks destroying our basic values of individual freedom and equality  &mdash;  and with them the identity of Britain itself.</p>
<p><b>Miseries</b></p>
<p>Dr Nazir-Ali understands this very clearly. This might be thought all the more remarkable since he was born not in Britain but in Pakistan. But that is precisely why he does understand what is at stake.</p>
<p>Back in the Eighties, he warned of the rise of radical Islamism. No-one listened. Now he urges an &#8216;ideological battle&rsquo; against fundamentalist Islam, which he likens to the Western struggle against Marxism. But the church still isn&rsquo;t listening, and is falling over itself to accommodate it instead.</p>
<p>Thus Dr Williams&rsquo;s lamentable statement that there was no reason why sharia law should not be accepted in Britain over certain areas of Muslim life  &mdash;  thereby abandoning British Muslim women, in particular, to the miseries of the second-class existence dictated by such religious law.</p>
<p>Dr Nazir-Ali&rsquo;s outspoken opposition to such developments has made him powerful enemies within the church. Last summer, a group of influential churchmen met to work out how to sideline those &#8216;aggressive&rsquo; Christians who were &#8216;increasing the level of fear&rsquo; by talking about the threat from radical Islam. Among those in their sights was the Bishop of Rochester.</p>
<p>In any sane world, Michael Nazir-Ali  &mdash;  a church leader whose intellect is matched by his courage and insight  &mdash;  should be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury to defend our society at this most dangerous time. Instead, he is out.</p>
<p>The question now arises whether he will become the effective leader of the church in the Third World, which is on the edge of schism over gay rights and women priests.</p>
<p>If that were to happen, he could become a formidable adversary of the current craven church leadership and the prevailing doctrine of appeasement and religious submission.</p>
<p>But for the meantime, his departure threatens to make the church even more irrelevant, and its capacity to prevent this country from going under weaker than ever before.<br>

			<p>a credit to his people. apparently the fact the he isn&rsquo;t white, and thus unable to join the BNP that the COE hates so much, doesn&rsquo;t give him a blank check to criticize all the other Pakistanis who are destroying Britain. i think Mr. Nazir-Ali, along with other proud, British Christians should start their own church, the church of sane englishmen.</p>
<p>god save the west.</p>

			<p>  Where is Henry VIII now? We need a 21st century reformation of the church of england. The church is tied to the government of England, which has been victimized by traitors for over 60 years now. Christians/white values are under attack, and are in danger of being banned in the western world. Where will we make a stand? When will we make a stand? Even if we are defeated, it would be better to go down fighting. I cannot bear the thought of the generations coming after us being subjugated to the whims of their new masters. What will we say when we are asked by our descendents why we didn&rsquo;t fight for our country? Has anyone noticed how there are always horrific shootings on the news continuously whenever the democrats are in power? Cradle to grave socialism is the mantra of both the parties in this country. In my eyes, there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of difference between socialism and communism. Hell, the communist party in this country is in love with Obama. England is gushing breathlessly about the possibility of a black prime minister. What the Hell is going on that white people are such sheeple? </p>

			<p>Nazir-Ali is a fine man and an ideal bishop (probably the finest in the Church of England today).</p>
<p>This gives the lie to the narrow conception of &#8220;racialism&#8221;. It would, after all, surely be better to have a culture of civilised non-whites than a culture of barbarian whites.</p>
<p>The complication lies in the fact that civilisation (in its full development) has generally been the property of white societies, however excellent individual non-whites may be.</p>
<p>Still, it is a mistake to use an unthinking white nationalism as an excuse to devalue the contribution of such fine individuals as Michael Nazir-Ali, who understand, from both sides of the cultural divide, the virtues of Western, Christian civilisation over the alternatives. </p>

			<p>This is commonplace. Although whites such as Mark Steyn stand up for western civilization, it&rsquo;s more often left to Muslim outcasts such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Irshad Manji, and so forth to sound the alarm bells and plead for westerners to stop hiding their heads in the sand and face reality. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s great to see feminists such as Phyllis Chesler and gays such as Bruce Bawer also realize that western civilization, founded on Christianity, is really vastly superior to anything that the third world can possibly produce.</p>

<p>Rubbish!  It does no such thing!  All but the most narrow-minded bigots acknowledge the fact there are intelligent, moral, conscientious types among most if not all races of mankind.  It is an incontrovertible fact, however, the most intelligent (in terms of creativity) and most moral (in terms of legal and ethical advances) are Whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would, after all, surely be better to have a culture of civilised non-whites than a culture of barbarian whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell me, what White country on earth today has a culture that can seriously be considered barbaric?  I can name many non-White ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;The complication lies in the fact that civilisation (in its full development) has generally been the property of white societies, however excellent individual non-whites may be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Go back and re-read what you wrote.  Your fourth sentence contradicts (and utterly refutes) your second sentence.  Your post is a non sequitur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, it is a mistake to use an unthinking white nationalism as an excuse to devalue the contribution of such fine individuals as Michael Nazir-Ali&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?  If Whites need non-Whites to fight their battles for them, the war is lost already.</p>

			<p>I prefer the belief that we can &#8220;whitewash&#8221; people such as Michael Nazir-Ali by, first, not accepting too many people of his racial descent into our societies; and, second, by requiring the ones, whom we do permit, to mix with the native white population, which, by the way, would have to be big enough to be able to intermarry with non-whites such as Nazir-Ali without ULTIMATELY changing our national skin color.</p>
<p>This is actually an opinion that certain early Southern American (Anglo-Saxon) aristocrats had about the Native American population in Virginia, the Carolinas, etc. That is, they believed that the earliest Americans should have intermarried with the Indians, and continued to whitewash them with fresh white blood until their skin was indistinguishable from any other Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a game of numbers. If white people continue to multiply, our problems will eventually take care of themselves.</p>

			<p>Islam is a useful tool that we can use to undermine liberal society. Ideas of progress and liberalism - the notion that the individual is essentially divorced from his society and lineage, and thus has no innate loyalties to any people or institution - is the real enemy of our people. The growth of Islam in the West may be a bitter pill to swallow at present, but in the long run its corrosive influence on Western liberalism will play into our hands.</p>

<p>Ironically, that is already under way! Many ex-C of E members are turning toward Roman Catholicism. Maybe this is fitting since the Church of England once belonged to Rome.Tony Blair, the ex-Prime Minister of Britain, is a recent example. He officially converted to Rome last year after being C of E his entire life. </p>
<p>I think had England remained Catholic, instead of turning Protestant, it wouldn&rsquo;t be in the multicultural mess it&rsquo;s in now&hellip;</p>

<p>Blair has always been catholic, but hid this fact to advance in British politics. As Prime Minister he took every opportunity to visit the vatican and kiss the pope&rsquo;s ring.</p>
<p>Would Anonymous care to enlighten us by naming a catholic country that is not in a mess, multi-cultural or otherwise.</p>

<p>France has the largest muslim community in Europe and, consequently, more problems. Belgium is a total basket case where  even European communities, French and Dutch, cannot get along together in a country with a growing and more menacing muslim community. </p>

			<p>I fear that we have become a post-civilization society.  We reached the top of the hill and now it&rsquo;s a long slide down.  I hate to be negative, hopefully something will jar people from their narcissitic narrow lives.  Educated liberals have to realize that when societies&rsquo; values go downhill, the material society along with advanced culture will also go downhill.  You cannot have an educated, sophisticated culture in the midst of brutish behavior which is what is coming next. We are going into the dark ages again. </p>

			<p>Voter wrote that the Church of England should join the Catholic Church.  That sounds like a great idea.  At least the Catholic Church stands up for its beliefs.  The Anglican Church has become an exclusive club for intellectuals.  If the Anglicans joined the Catholic Church, it would really send a much needed jolt through the population.  I would love to see the mealy-mouth Anglican leaders presiding over a non-existant church with no one in the pews.  Maybe this would get people&rsquo;s attention that could spark an interest in Christian culture. </p>

			<p>The difference between the Catholic and Protestant nations in Europe is, for the most part, the Catholic nations are still proud of their culture. </p>
<p>The Poles love the fact that they are Polish. The Italians are proud to be Italian, the French guard their culture very closely. In Germany, the Catholic Bavarians are acutely aware of their German heritage and fine with it. The Czecks, Slovaks and Lithuanians are all proud as well. The Spanish are proud to be Spanish, the Basques and Portuguese are proud of their own also. The same is true for Ukrainians, Greeks and Russians (all Catholic)!</p>
<p>Now, show me a proud Englishman, Dutchman, Finn, Dane, Norwegian or Swede (All Protestant)&hellip;?</p>
<p>Exactly! They don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>The only reason there are &#8220;proud&#8221; Scots is because they can rally together against England. </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the people here who took my (very obvious) sarcasm seriously!  Some people just don&rsquo;t get irony.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The difference between the Catholic and Protestant nations in Europe is, for the most part, the Catholic nations are still proud of their culture.&#8221;<br>

<p>Not really.  They&rsquo;re all going down the tubes. Some countries are just going faster than others.</p>

			<p>The problems with christianity and esp. Catholicism is that it&rsquo;s always been too rigid and thus drove peopele away. <br>
The larger problem is that people lost GOD and I&rsquo;m not talking about &#8220;the church&#8221; in general (whatever denomination). I&rsquo;m talking about the simple belief in a higher power and the substitution thereof with hunam ego and arrogance. Humanity has created a new god - man itself! We are so great and so wise and so competent. We know everything and are so mighty and also egotostical. As a conequence people have lost the ability to undesrstand and perceive threats by radical societies that don&rsquo;t believe in their morals and values. We&rsquo;ve become convinced that we can convince the whole world to be liberal, tolerant and civilized which isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t think anyone should be forced to believe in God but it&rsquo;s amazing how along with losing their own god, european nations are fighting to accept and accomodate the god, the customs and the &#8220;values&#8221; of a stoneage religion that is threatening to annihilate them and their way of life. The blindness evident in their behavior is nothing short of AMAZING.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just GOD&rsquo;s revenge&hellip;..</p>
