			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaxon Van Derbeken, San Francisco Chronicle, March 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The day before Lovelle Mixon unleashed a barrage of gunfire that killed four Oakland police officers, the department&rsquo;s investigators learned that DNA evidence had linked the fugitive parolee to an unsolved rape this year, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The possibility that Mixon feared being arrested for rape is a key factor for investigators trying to understand why the 26-year-old Oakland man opened fire on two motorcycle officers who pulled him over for a traffic stop Saturday afternoon at 74th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Mixon stood over the wounded officers, Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, and Officer John Hege, 41, and fired at least one round into each with a handgun before fleeing on foot to his sister&rsquo;s apartment half a block down 74th, acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said.</p>
<p>Although the reason for the traffic stop isn&rsquo;t known, Jordan said witness accounts indicate that Dunakin, possibly suspicious of what turned out to be a fake driver&rsquo;s license, motioned to Hege to remove Mixon from his car just before Mixon opened fire.</p>
<p>When SWAT officers, acting on a tip, later stormed the nearby apartment, Mixon opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35, and wounding Sgt. Pat Gonzales before other officers shot him to death.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials at a state laboratory reported to police Friday that DNA from a rape that happened in late January or early February matched Mixon&rsquo;s, said Lt. Kevin Wiley, who oversees the police sex crimes unit.</p>
<p>Mixon&rsquo;s DNA was on file because of his conviction in 2002 for assault with a deadly weapon in an attempted carjacking in San Francisco, for which he served six years in prison. The state lab&rsquo;s match was reported Friday afternoon to an Oakland police sex crimes investigator, Officer Herb Webber, Wiley said.</p>
<p>Webber got the news shortly before leaving work at his scheduled time, Wiley said. Police could not have issued an arrest warrant immediately for Mixon because investigators first would have needed to gather another sample of his DNA for comparison purposes, the lieutenant said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wiley said the victim had been raped in Oakland and did not know her attacker. She helped police produce a composite sketch of the attacker, but police would not reveal other details of the case.</p>
<p>Police are investigating a second, similar rape to determine whether Mixon might be a suspect, said Officer Jeff Thomason, a department spokesman. &#8220;We&rsquo;re looking to see if there&rsquo;s more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Oakland investigators have suspected Mixon of being involved in other crimes but were never able to produce enough evidence to bring charges.</p>
<p>Police had been searching for Mixon since he was declared a parolee at large in February, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Oakland police had also considered Mixon a suspect in the December 2007 slaying of Ramon Stevens, 42, who was shot and killed on the street near the corner of 86th Avenue and International Boulevard. Mixon was detained on a parole violation in February 2008, but homicide investigators could not make a case.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s sister said a witness had told her Mixon was the killer, authorities said. But Assistant District Attorney Tom Rogers said Monday that the witness did not want to cooperate, and Mixon was freed in November.</p>
<p>Court records show that Mixon had only a 10th-grade education. He moved to the Oakland area in 1996 from Atlanta and was a special education student at Skyline High School before dropping out.</p>
<p>He accumulated a long list of juvenile offenses in Alameda County, including possession of stolen property, vandalism, petty theft and battery, court records show.</p>
<p>In March 2002, Mixon and two other attackers tried to carjack a truck, fired a shot and pistol-whipped the driver on Mission Street near Sixth Street in San Francisco.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>This morning I listened to an interview with Wilson Riles, former Oakland City Council member, and he said the sentiment about this shooting among many young black men in Oakland was, &#8220;That&rsquo;s the way I want to go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interview was on &#8220;The Morning Show&#8221; on super-lefty Berkeley radio station KPFA. I could have predicted the content  &mdash;  a decent amount of expression of sadness over the loss of the officers, followed by lots of talk about how the system is failing young black men (Apparently, unless you can place a basketball in their hands as soon as school lets out, they automatically pick up weapons and start shooting people).</p>
<p>When I was a child and teenager, there were no organized activities in our neighborhoods, but somehow we found enjoyable things to do that didn&rsquo;t involve mayhem.</p>

			<p>We really need to set aside certain urban areas  &mdash;  Oakland, Detroit, South Chicago, East St. Louis come to mind  &mdash;  and let them have their &#8220;black rule&#8221;. If they don&rsquo;t like cops, the next time one of the locals needs help let him/her call a gangbanger. If they don&rsquo;t respect white educators, let blacks teach each other in Ebonics or whatever it is they want. If they think white politicians are keepin&rsquo; &#8216;em down, let them elect their favorite black politicians.</p>
<p>The few, very few, that actually want to live a civilized life can move into white areas if they can manage to behave themselves and obey the laws. Under the present circumstances of this country, I think it would be pretty magnanimous of white people to let them do that.</p>

<p>I dont think he was that dumb, only antisocial, he knew how to aim his gun properly because he shot those motorcycle officers in the head, a feat that is beyond a standard ooker who holds his gun sideways. The two guys he got with the AK-47 were ambushed and shot trough a door, another feat requiring more than average black IQ.<br>
BTW, judging by his mugshot he was a high yella octoroon.</p>

			<p>So, lesee here, Mixon:</p>
<p>1) Was a suspect in a murder<br>
2) Was a rapist, possibly a serial rapist<br>
3) Was a convicted of assault with a deadly weapon (during an armed robbery)<br>
4) Murdered four (4!) policemen in one day.</p>
<p>Nope, definitely <b>not</b> a monster.</p>

			<p>&#8220;followed by lots of talk about how the system is failing young black men&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the system failed the public.  This guy has had many juvenile offences, suspected of murder, convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, violated his parole and we now learn DNA evidence linked him to the rape of a 12 year old girl.  He should never have been released back into society.  The system failed the victims.  The system is breaking down.  The prisons are full.  The judicial system is burdened with costly investigations, appeals, parole officers, and affirmative action social workers.  It&rsquo;s breaking down because it is overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Why should whites continueously sacrifice there sense of self at the expense of blacks? In this extreme-radical-case, the lives of four white police officers.</p>
<p>There should be a majority black (if not all black,) police force in Oakland.  </p>

<p>In later years there would be talk about the &#8216;Oakland Ghetto&rsquo; and the heros in the &#8216;resistance&rsquo; etc.  But this action would knock down the violence for a good while.</p>

<p>It is not going to be easy, but it will solve most of the problems we now have.</p>
<p>If this action is not taken very soon, we will soon be over-run with nothing but black thugs.</p>

<blockquote>
As Brother Fritz Pointer noted below, we can and must police ourselves, the police must be from our community, not living in Dublin, Tracy and Livermore.
These are foreigners who have no love for our community. They are here to enforce white supremacy, white privilege and white power. And nothing shall change but go from bad to worse until the fundamental order is radically restructured. Sun Ra taught me, &#8220;The Creator got things fixed, you can&rsquo;t go forward or backward until you do the right thing.&#8221; So do the right thing, Oakland, the eyes of the world are on you at this hour, as it has been in the past when you raised up to check the power of brute beasts in blue uniforms.

<p>Well, it would be illegal, it runs totally opposite to the constitution, and most of the people there are law-abiding American citizens whom would be murdered wholesale and  Oakland is probably 40% non black,  other than that, capital idea!</p>

			<p>In addition to the four murders he committed, and the one rape he almost certainly committed (they found his semen inside a 12-year old rape victim&rsquo;s vagina), he was also a suspect in four more rapes, and the sole suspect in another murder. </p>

			<p>Information Insurgent, are you for real? How on earth can you say from his mugshot that the killer is an octoroon (7/8 white)? Mixon may not be as black as Wesley Snipes, but he is certainly darker than Denzel Washington and Barack Obama. Does that mean the blackness in Lovelle&rsquo;s sister is 1/8 and his mama is no more than 1/4? The Oakland community doesn&rsquo;t seem to think they are defendign a white man. Get over it: Lovelle Mixon is most certainly a black man in all respects.</p>

			<p>This may interest those who carry firearms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Enemy&#8221; overwhelmingly; carries without a holster for the ability to deny possessing a weapon, has little formal training, &#8220;Sprays and Prays&#8221;, does not seek stopping power in his firearms but will purchase whatever is available. Rarely cleans and maintains their weapons. Major tactic is to &#8220;get one into you&#8221; so he can then stand over you and put one in your head as a finisher. Favorite caliber 9mm.</p>
<p>Legal CCW permit holders use holsters; often have formal training, are taught to use &#8220;the front sight&#8221; and use tactics and conserve ammo, purchase weapons specifically for stopping power, Maintain and clean their weapons, would be brought up on chargers of murder if they walked up to the person they just shot in self defense and administered a &#8220;finisher&#8221;. Favorite caliber: .45 ACP.<br>

			<p>As a correction to the above statement that the police officers were all white, one of them must have been Asian, as the family name Sakai is Japanese.</p>
<p>California should be commended for having banned the AK-47.  Preventing law-abiding target shooters from having military-lookalike rifles is so much more important than keeping murderers and child rapists off the streets.  Good going, guys!</p>
