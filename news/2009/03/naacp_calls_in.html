			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Loving, The Skanner (Portland, Oregon), March 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of complaints and as many as five separate lawsuits have been filed against the Seattle School District over its plans to save money by shuttering facilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the District this week announced its schedule of quarterly meetings to take public input on its &#8220;Excellence for All&#8221; education plan.</p>
<p>Officials said in a statement that the hearings will involve discussions about development of a new Student Assignment Plan.</p>
<p>Phyllis Beaumonte, Seattle King County NAACP education chair, said this week that NACCP President James Bible has also filed as many as 200 complaints with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have lawyers who are going to be working with us on this, so we&rsquo;ve done that, now we have to wait,&#8221; Beaumonte said. &#8220;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re going to sit and do nothing  &mdash;  we&rsquo;re going to continue to generate and mobilize parents to be very vigilant as it relates to the School Assignment Plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old plan was declared unconstitutional in a U.S. Supreme Court decision handed down in June, 2007, which found that race could not solely be used to assign students to public schools.</p>
<p>In a blog posting dated Monday, March 9, Bible criticizes district officials for instituting policies that penalize students for their race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you are poor, a minority or speak English as a second language our public school systems are intended to create opportunities that level the playing field,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;It is unfortunate that the Seattle School District has forgotten the importance of providing quality education for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bible cites statistics indicating, he argues, that a vast majority of children affected by the school closure plan are &#8220;minority, many speak English as a second language and many have learning disabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bible says that four of the five schools slated for closure are between 99 percent and 70 percent minority, while the fifth is 50.2 percent minority.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also notable that these schools also served a disproportionate number of students in poverty,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;During economic hard times public schools should not be balancing the budget on the backs of those that are poor and minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he has for months, Bible argues that smaller class sizes should not be grounds for closure and consolidation, but rather should be embraced and supported by the district as better environments for learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should seize this opportunity to do better by our children instead of seeking to eliminate opportunity for disenfranchised populations,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;The Schools that are now slated for closure were doing as well at educating children of color and the poor as any other schools. Instead of closing these schools we need to provide greater support.&#8221;</p>
<p>District officials say they must find a way to close a projected $24 million shortfall in their operating budget for next school year.</p>
<p>Tuesday, district officials and staff at the Seattle schools&rsquo; Alliance for Education, an independent, non-profit organization that supports district initiatives, announced they&rsquo;d won $9 million in grants from local and national foundations in support of the district&rsquo;s five-year strategic plan, which they say will &#8220;expand college-ready coursework for students; real-time student data to drive decision-making; and stronger professional development opportunities for teachers, school leaders, and district officials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grant funds include $7.2 million from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation; $1.2 million from the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation; $308,000 from Boeing; and $254,000 from The Stuart Foundation.<br>

			<p>St. Louis City is closing a bunch of schools, too, but there probably won&rsquo;t be NAACP lawsuits because of the existence of inter-district deseg, and also intra-district deseg.</p>

			<p>The black answer to low black achievement is to hire a teacher for every five blacks, and make sure each one of them has a private tutor at taxpayer expense, something similar to what the Obamanation proposes.</p>
<p>Even if they did that, blacks would still be far behind the other races in this country, so what&rsquo;s the use?</p>

New meaning of &#8220;civil rights&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>Transfer of funds from whites to blacks, directly or indirectly.</i></p>
<p>If the flow of funds is interrupted or decreased, it constitutes a violation of the civil rights of blacks.</p>

<p>People I know used to joke about libs wanting a private tutor for every black student.  About 7 or 8 years ago, they proposed it seriously.  Jokes about libs today become lib reality tomorrow, they&rsquo;re that ridiculous and predictable.</p>

I was listening to local black talk radio today and the topic was Buffalo public schools.</p>
<p>The guest was flipping over backwards and spinning on his head trying not to say that integration and desegregated schools are the problems.</p>
<p>These people know full well that integration and desegregated schools have not improved black achievement and in most cases have made the problems even worse.</p>
<p>The guest made a point that it wasn&rsquo;t an issue of money because Buffalo public schools are the largest segment of the city budget. The guest was contorting everything but what he was really saying was that blacks need to have their own schools in their own neighborhoods with their own teachers, principles, and administrators. Only he COULDN&rsquo;T say it because to do so would be an admission that their &#8216;leaders&rsquo; who pushed for integration were wrong and their efforts have done more to undermine black communities than any form of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>When public officials insist on denying scientific reality because it clashes with the left&rsquo;s politically correct delusions about racial equality, this is what they will forever get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much like watching a child who doesn&rsquo;t believe in gravity continuously hurl a rock up in the air and go on inventing false tortured excuses for why it keeps dropping down again.  </p>

<p>I suggest that, as we know, to have said that would have brought his/her career to an instant halt so that he/she could spend the next few years in court as a defendant racist.</p>
