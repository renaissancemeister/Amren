<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-africa/20090228/AF.Zimbabwe/">Mugabe Uses Birthday Bash to Rebuke White Farmers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With his nation&rsquo;s economy in shambles, President Robert Mugabe threw himself a lavish 85th birthday party Saturday, using the opportunity to call on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s last white farmers to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land distribution will continue. It will not stop,&#8221; Mugabe said in Chinhoyi, 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Harare. &#8220;The few remaining white farmers should quickly vacate their farms as they have no place there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Dozens of the several hundred white farmers left in Zimbabwe are currently challenging the right of its government to confiscate their land before a regional tribunal of Africa judges.</p>
<p>The birthday bash, which reportedly cost $250,000, was held as Zimbabwe&rsquo;s new unity government failed to secure financial aid to rescue the country&rsquo;s collapsed economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still in control and hold executive authority, so nothing much has changed,&#8221; Mugabe told a crowd of about 2,000.</p>
<p>There has been a recent upsurge in reported &#8220;invasions&#8221; of white-owned farms, with one support group saying at least 40 white farmers have been forced off their land since January.</p>
<p>Last year, a regional court ruled that 78 white Zimbabweans could keep their farms, saying the government&rsquo;s land grab policy was racially motivated.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mugabe called the ruling &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and said it was of &#8220;no consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have our own laws which govern our own land issues,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>The horrid treatment of Whites across the entirety of South Africa is shameful. While the media focuses on the slightest harm to a brown-skinned person, Whites are butchered (and in this Country, too) to the sound of collective indifference from the media. </p>

			<p>Maybe so, but don&rsquo;t come crying to the world when you&rsquo;ve got nothing to eat.  That won&rsquo;t stop you from doing so, and it won&rsquo;t stop do-badder do-gooder white lib from putting something in it.</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t those White RHODESIAN farmers form some unity front, some White nationalist base, or a small community f even a few farms and buy arms and munitions? White people never get it until they&rsquo;re ruined and have no chance. God damn.</p>

			<p>We need to give these white farmers a free pass into this country, Austrailia or New Zealand.  Maybe we can exchange them for some worthless blacks from south africa,.. we will give them 100,000 to one!  Let the white farmers leave, or else they will just be murdered eventually.  Let zimbabweans STARVE, and dare this country, or any other, send them food aid!  They will reap what they sow, NOTHING.  Let them eat dirt and weeds.</p>

<p>Fine, then the White farmers should leave. And let the rest of the country starve, if that&rsquo;s the way they want it.</p>
<p>Now, can someone please explain to me why the US can&rsquo;t take them in as refugees?</p>

<p>Whites are clearly not wanted in Zimbabwe; at least by Mugabe and his gang.</p>
<p>Without international support (and they&rsquo;re not going to get any), white farmers are sitting ducks. </p>
<p>My hope is that white farmers sell their farms if they can, take the money and leave. If they stay, they&rsquo;re dead. If they leave, they can live to fight later to regain their land when circumstances change.</p>
<p>I wonder if white Zimbabweans qualify for relocation just like black Somalians. After all, they&rsquo;re both Africans.</p>

I guess that it&rsquo;s because then the State Dept. would have to admit that Whites are being persecuted and brutalized due to their race and thus need asylum. Along with that admission would be an acknowledgement that their tormentors are Black. And THAT can never be admitted. Look how good a job they&rsquo;ve done at hiding the numerous heinous acts being perpetrated every day against Whites by our own home grown Blacks.</p>

			<p>He might as well say farmers have no place in Zimbabwe, since the only capable farmers are the white ones. So few blacks are capable of farming, the entire country is fast becoming a wasteland. The reason Mugabe is so desperate to get his hands on the few remaining pieces of land own by white farmers, is they are also the only ones that are still fertile with crops. I have to laugh at his methods though, only a few years ago, he had the audacity to try and dupe white farmers into coming back, claiming he would not steal their farms this time. Nobody fell for it, so in further desperation, he is going back to his old strong arm tactics. It must be humiliating for him to face how inept his own people are.</p>

			<p>Not too long ago, I was reading that Prince Harry or Prince William had a girl friend from Rhodesia/Zim by the name of Davy.  Last name Davy&hellip;don&rsquo;t recall her first name.  She was in England going to law school.  He father apparently had bucks.  She would fly from Southern Africa to Thailand to vacation.  Then six or eight weeks later, she would fly with her friends to someplace else in the world to vacation yet again.  I don&rsquo;t know the name of her father, but all of her family was from Rhodesia/Zimbab.  What I don&rsquo;t know and couldn&rsquo;t find out was what the deal was between her father in Zimbabwe and Mugabe.  All the whites there are getting kicked in the teeth by the blacks but apparently this white family continues to lead a charmed life in the country, having no threats from Mugabe or other blacks.  Me thinks the family is under the grace and protection of Mugabe.  Is Davy&rsquo;s dad dealing in drugs with the Mugabe regime or what gives?  Anyone know?  He is knocking down big bucks where apparently no other white family in Zim is doing so.</p>

			<p>Where are all the bleeding heart liberals that wailed &amp; demonstrated against the evils of apartheid? This is why you never listen to such bleeding hearts, they bleed for minorities but when  injustice and harm occurs by the hands of these minorities against whites they are silent. </p>

<p>BTW, We don&rsquo;t seem to get much American media coverage of the swinishly grotesque events in scenic Zimbabwe - wonder why that is?</p>

<p>Why do you think this is unusual? we are not told the truth by the MSM about what goes on in Detroit, Chicago, N.O. or anywhere else in our OWN COUNTRY!! No offense meant of course.</p>

			<p>They wanted independence and they got it. It&rsquo;s taken about a generation or two for the natives to ruin the country to the point that they can&rsquo;t even hope to sustain themselves.<br>
Every white should leave and all aid to that country should be stopped - no, make that the entire continent. <br>

			<p>It is interesting how human beings have the propensity for waiting for disaster to hit. Just like in hurricane Katrina, where people were warned days, even a week before that what was coming was going to be big, really big. Yet, hundreds of thousands just stayed oblivious. Many of us Americans have lived such a spoiled life, compared to much of the world, that we have that attitude of  &mdash;  things will all work out, because they always have. That is probably the case with the white population in many parts of Africa as well. They have had a charmed exisistence for a long time, and &#8220;things will all work out&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Some very good comments, but to correct a few inaccuracies. South Africa is a country not a region. Robert Mugabe is not seize the remaining farms due to the fertile soil or the abundance of crops. The first lesson in remaining in power in Africa is to have a perpetual struggle. The easiest struggle, to get the electorate to perpetually vote for you, is against the white man. When your electorate has an average IQ of 67, it doesn&rsquo;t take much, you simply blame everything on colonialism, Britain, Apartheid or slavery. It is axiomatic. These idiots will openly acknowledge that life is worse under Mugabe than it was under Ian Smith (the last white leader), but if you said the whites were coming, they would quickly fetch their assegais, pangas and AK47s. I don&rsquo;t see that it is any different in the USA.</p>

			<p>To show you an example of fooling the masses to hold on to power, witness this:</p>
<p>An arrest warrant has just been issued for the President of the Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, by the International Court. He, in turn, has lashed out at the Western (read white) governments, claiming that it is &#8220;merely a ploy to grab the country&rsquo;s oil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course this is nonesense, but his idiotic people will believe him, and will rally around to ensure he remains in power. A prime example of the perpetual white enemy. No matter how genocidal your rule has been, you merely need to invoke the vision of the white man returning for all to be forgiven.</p>
