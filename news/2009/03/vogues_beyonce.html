<h1>Vogue&rsquo;s Beyonce Cover, Racist?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Annika Harris, The Frisky, March 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some folks have gotten their panties in a bunch over Beyonce&rsquo;s cover for the &#8220;Shape Issue&#8221; of Vogue. Beyonce is one of only five black women to grace the cover of Vogue since it was founded in 1892, but blogs like Jezebel and Sociological Images think the magazine was being sexist and racist by putting her on the cover {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[A] blogger also asserts that the story is racist because it reinforces the stereotype that black women are especially curvy. I&rsquo;ve never met a black woman, or man for that matter, that didn&rsquo;t enjoy a little something extra in the trunk and thighs. I&rsquo;m not saying we should reinforce stereotypes that have some truth, but I think most people only find fault with this stereotype when black women are hyper-sexualized as a result of their curves. Vogue didn&rsquo;t sexualize Beyonce, in any way, as her body is hardly visible on the cover. {snip}</p>
<p>What I do find racist about this cover is that Beyonce fits an accepted ideal of black beauty. She has slightly Anglo features and light skin, like Halle Berry, who has also graced the cover. And she wears a long weave/wig of hair that most black women can&rsquo;t grow naturally. Couple her appearance with her success and you realize Beyonce was a safe, unsurprising choice for the cover of the &#8220;Shape Issue,&#8221; which is an absolutely ridiculous concept for Vogue anyway, whose motto should be &#8220;thinner is better.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If Black women are so hyper-sexualized then why do so many Black men pursue White women?  There is no group on earth that demonstrates more rampant obesity - even morbid obesity - than Black women.  We all see them.  Huge, humongous women in jeans with a size 60 waist and 38 inch thighs walking the streets in most cities and towns.  Could it be that just the reverse is true, that they are for the most part - more masculine - than women of any other race or ethnic background?  We see them on the streets with their brood of welfare children.  We see Black mothers threatening their children with phrases like, &#8220;Ahm gonna kick yo ass!&#8221;  &#8220;Ahm gonna beet yo head agains da wall!&#8221;  This is femininity?</p>

<p>Curvy must be the new politically correct word for chunky.</p>

<p>Looking at that picture I don&rsquo;t see anything remotely anglo looking about it.  It looks like a thinner Paul Winfield in drag.   </p>

		<p>Okay it can officially be said that these people are completely nuts. They look for any reason anywhere to cry racism; they have gone beyond being a joke. Instead of taking them seriously they deserve nothing but being laughed at. I can&rsquo;t wait till they collapse under the weight of thier monumental stupidity. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it.  If black females don&rsquo;t have any white blood in them, they&rsquo;re like really, really unattractive.</p>
<p>So if it is those types blacks are whining about now, they aren&rsquo;t really black, just as Obama isn&rsquo;t really black.</p>
<p>Look at O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s kids.  I&rsquo;m betting his daughter doesn&rsquo;t have tight kinky hair, due obviously to the fact that O.J. is partially white with a white wife, which he murdered.  If either of his kids kid marries a white, expect the offspring to look like Beyonce or the Rock without the muscles or any other light tan &#8220;black&#8221; with white features and body shape.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That KFC that they&rsquo;re known for scarfing&hellip;that stuff is loaded with MSG, which can make you put on weight.  (That&rsquo;s why I avoid that place.)</p>
<p>Black women tend to be very in-your-face and talk-to-the-hand.  One time I saw an episode of Divorce Court where this black man and white woman were getting a divorce&hellip;the guy had a posterboard listing his reasons why he prefers white women.  Top of the list  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re more submissive.  Easier to manipulate and control.  Black women know what their male relatives are like, they hear them spout their nonsense, and they won&rsquo;t be fooled  &mdash;  or &#8220;controlled.&#8221;</p>

Although I enjoyed reading this, I consider the sources to be &#8220;fringe&#8221; and therefore not really worth paying much attention to. Have you ever heard of the blogs called &#8220;Jezebel&#8221; or &#8220;Sociological Images&#8221;?  No, me neither.</p>

		<p>The constant complaining by blacks about perceived injustices are similar to the thought process of 8 year olds. Do blacks not realize how pathetically stupid they come across to anyone with half a brain? I agree with the above comment - simply avoid blacks altogether for a sane life. </p>

		<p>Black women are hyper-sexualized?  I almost spit out my coffee on my computer screen reading this.  Let&rsquo;s face it, there&rsquo;s no tactful way to say this other than black women look like black men.  First, they run stories about about black models not being able to find work then this garbage?  The liberal media needs to get its act together and get on the same page because you can&rsquo;t hint that they&rsquo;re out of shape and unattractive then say they&rsquo;re hyper-sexualized.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just like blacks to complain if they don&rsquo;t see enough blacks on the cover of magazines or in enough tv commercials or tv shows and then turn around and complain when a black is featured on a magazine or tv show.</p>

<p>Yup, just go on craigslist and look up the posts listing &#8220;curvy&#8221; or &#8220;thick booty&#8221; women.  It&rsquo;s either a morbidly obese black woman asking for a man who &#8220;isn&rsquo;t afraid of a REAL woman&#8221;, or a morbidly obese white woman who is basically looking for a black man with no standards.  I&rsquo;m not attracted to the anorexic, tomboy-ish look promoted by the &#8220;high fashion&#8221; industry, but the &#8220;rebellion&#8221; has gone way too far.  </p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s racist b/c they always use black and hispanic women as examples when they talk about &#8220;women being beautiful in every size&#8221;. </p>
<p>White women still get stuck rib-showing, six foot models like Gisele Bunchen and Angelina Jolie as their examples of beauty. </p>

<p>Please tell us HOW!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine &hellip; if you&rsquo;re independently wealthy and live in a largely white part of the country. Then you can arrange your own life as it suits you.  Unfortunately, most  of us are FORCED into contact with them on a daily basis, the result of our government&rsquo;s  programs and actions, and there&rsquo;s no way we can avoid such encounters. </p>
<p>I will grant that there is an occasional pleasant one, but they are canceled out by the many unpleasant, obnoxious, or unreasonable ones who will spoil your day&hellip;. this, no matter all the happy, friendly black &amp; white buddies we see on television and the movies.  Real life is a long way from such fantasy.</p>

		<p>Why do they even put &#8220;black&#8221; (mulatto) women on the cover if they&rsquo;re just going to do everything they can to make them look as White as possible? White men don&rsquo;t find black women attractive. Just look at rape statistics for objective evidence. It&rsquo;s extremely rare for a White to rape a black.</p>

		<p>This is one reason why need to be separated from blacks, not just for us but for their own good.  All of this talk of equality and they&rsquo;re forced to compete with an impossible standard of beauty that they can&rsquo;t attain because of their genetic makeup.  Queen Latifa did commercials for Jenny Craig last year and at the end of her time on them she claimed to have lost weight but she looked exactly the same as she did when she started it.  It&rsquo;s cruel to give black women false hope that they shed the pounds because by and large it&rsquo;s hereditary.    </p>

		<p>As one who worked in a black community for years, I can tell you that many of the black women I came across looked like black men.  Their faces were similar, the hair short and kinky, and they would dress in pants and a shirt.  I would look at their chests, looking for breasts, to see if they were a female.  That was about the only way I could tell.  Many times even their voice was similar to that of a black man.</p>

		<p>If having Beyonce on the cover of Vogue magazine is racist, then her being on the cover of Ebony, Essence, Sophisticates Black Hair, Vibe, and other black publications is equally racist. It seems as though most blacks glorify other blacks (or half blacks)that have caucasian features and straight hair, but they are the first to scream racism. Blacks will always be at the bottom of the totum poll with this attitude. They need to except the fact that black people are not white people and that they don&rsquo;t originally look causcasian. Not excepting their true black features and hair texture is a true sign of self hate.</p>

<p>More specifically, they are obsessed with WHITE PEOPLE. No other race of people are they so consumed with in there daily thoughts. I find this to be disturbing-especially since whites are forced to be around them. </p>

<p>Excellent point. I mean, how many whites (or other racial groups for that matter,) wake up in the morning and acknowledge what race they are? No race behaves like this except blacks. They are continueously conscious of the color of there skin. </p>

<p>The question is who are they doing this for anyhow?  With some of the kind of hippopotami I&rsquo;ve seen in public you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d all be life long dateless virgins.  But no, they&rsquo;ve got 5-6 kids all with different daddies so somebody must be &#8220;hittin dat&#8221;. Are they trying to look White so they can land a White man and if so, judging by interracial stats they&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree.  </p>

<p>White men should distance themselves from things like this anyway. The best response that we as white men can give to foolishness like this is to remain focused on what matters: excellence in our chosen profession and good character in the example we set for our next generation. </p>
<p>A recent local newspaper article detailed (well, actually bemoaned, given this is a majority-black area) how white women in this area were exceeding minority women in achieving CEO-level status in area companies. Blacks can fuss over Beyonce on a magazine cover all they want&hellip;we should respond with what white women are managing to accomplish here in the real world. <br>

		<p>Anonomyous: White men do find many black women attractive. Many of them are extremely atractive, but a whole lot of them are not.Why do so few white men rape black women? Maybe it it is guilt because of all of the anti white propaganda, specifically how the white slavemaster allegedly raped the black slave women. And maybe they are just a little scared of them.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord! Another one! Is there no end to the supply of euphemisims of the politically correct Left? I have a hard time keeping up with all of them. When they get done, they will have completly revised the dictionary and the English language!</p>

<p>Since we are all not the same, twisting the language is the only way to make us all equal.  Can you imagine Vogue&rsquo;s article &#8220;Real Women Have Curves&#8221; being literally translated into &#8220;Real Women are Fat?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>how to avoid blacks - do it. move.<br>
we did and life is safer, happier and less stressful. however, all blacks see whites and being near them, whenever possible as a great thing, unfortunately, the feeling is never mutual.<br>
i think racism laws should be repealed. is America about freedom or only about freedom when no one else&rsquo;s feelings are getting hurt ? - it&rsquo;s becoming that way - political correctness, etc. <br>
blacks will never be satisfied or happy with anything, including themselves. so stop trying to please them. ignore them. </p>
