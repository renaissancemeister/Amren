<h1>Rev. Al&rsquo;s Half-Price Deal on $1.8m Taxes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chuck Bennett and Lois Weiss, New York Post, March 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton owed at least $1.8 million in back taxes before striking a sweetheart deal with the feds last summer that chopped the bill almost in half and kept him out of the slammer, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Treasury Department officers say Sharpton owed $351,798 from 2007, according to a document filed March 3 with the New York County Register Office.</p>
<p>This unpaid balance  &mdash;  a potential mix of back taxes and penalties  &mdash;  comes on top of a federal lien filed last Nov. 13 for $1,367,521 covering tax years 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>All the liens are filed as &#8220;1040&#8221; or personal income tax and listed his address as 680 Madison Ave.  &mdash;  the uber-swanky Helmsley Carlton House where Sharpton resides.</p>
<p>Last July, Sharpton cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn to end a longstanding criminal probe of his finances that reportedly encompassed his personal fortune, his quixotic 2004 presidential campaign spending and the National Action Network, his advocacy group.</p>
<p>Sharpton said he&rsquo;d personally pay back $1 million, including $500,000 upfront, as part of the settlement. But, the liens show his debts ran much deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rev. Al Sharpton is meeting his tax obligations with the IRS through an agreement that was completed in late summer of 2008. Since that time, he has made substantial payments and continues to do so. Any federal tax liens that have been filed are inclusive of all years included in the agreement. As those payments have been made, tax liens have been released,&#8221; said longtime Sharpton attorney Michael Hardy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharpton also was hit with a $19,914 lien filed on Dec. 31, 2008, from unpaid taxes in 1996.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sharpton also owes the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which was not part of the July settlement, $884,669, according to two liens covering years 2002 through 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharpton reportedly earns $750,000 a year hosting a syndicated radio talk show. He also collects anywhere from $15,000 to $20,000 per lecture and $2,000 per church sermon. On top of that, Sharpton does &#8220;consulting&#8221; work for corporations.<br>

			<p>There&rsquo;s truly something wrong in a world in which a rather stupid, criminally inclined, and utterly cartoonish buffoon such as Al Sharpton could owe any back taxes to any national treasury.</p>
<p>That anybody would pay to listen to the &#8220;opinions&#8221; and ravings of a lip-bibbling, venomous cretin like Sharpton says something more than a little ominous about our nation and the moral and intellectual values of our citizens.</p>

			<p>     Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if all the people who owed taxes told the IRS to take a hike. If Sharpton, Daschle, and Geithner can get away with it, why can&rsquo;t the ordinary guy ? The tax code is a joke. If God read it he would have trouble understanding it. My Italian grandmother never saw the inside of a school, but she had more wisdom than most people. I remember her telling me that when the Income Tax Act passed the people should have revolted and burned down Washington. She said the government would use tax money to get us into wars, make us prisoners of the government, and use our money to buy votes. She was right. </p>

			<p>While Al was too busy making YT pay he forgot to pay his fair share. Looks like al will have to step up his National Shakedown Network collections to maintain his lavish lifestyle</p>

			<p>funny how The IRS works, when I owed back taxes the IRS simply vacuumed out my checking accts., and there was no deal cutting, even though I was surely less able to pay then the Rev. Al. Is this what you call blak privilege?<br>
Poor ol&rsquo; YT jus can&rsquo;t catch a break!</p>

			<p>I sure wish the IRS would let me pay only half my taxes.</p>
<p>BTW Sharpton has always been a deadbeat. A few years ago he rented an office in the Empire State Building in order to look like a bigshot and was evicted for nonpayment of rent.</p>

			<p>I guess the good Reverend Sharpton isn&rsquo;t familiar with the part of the Bible which mentions paying unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar.</p>

			<p>Sharpton is nothing but a third rate con man. He belongs in jail.</p>

			<p>Is anyone really surprised by this? The same guy who screams words of praise on obama for making the evil greedy white man pay his taxes and not to keep his money from the poor black people that need it is keeping his money for himself.And now he only pays half of it? I bet he is the first in line to lead a campaign for higher taxes to benefit black students just as long as it is someone else footing the bill not him.</p>

			<p>We know how it works. If you are White and conservative, you&rsquo;ll pay and pay and pay. If you belong to a special privilege group, you&rsquo;ll get away with crime and get promoted within the democrat party.</p>

			<p>Sharpton does &#8220;consulting&#8221; work?</p>
<p>Is that a fancy term for shakedowns?</p>

			<p>The Sixteenth Amendment was never really ratified.  </p>
<p>That being said, who wants to bet that good old Al played the race card?</p>

			<p>I suspect a black shakedown artist of his caliber can make the amounts up from discrimination lawsuit clients or intimidated businesses quick enough.</p>

			<p>  I remember the late Harold Washington, former mayor of Chicago, &#8220;forgot&#8221; to pay his taxes for several years. Daschle and Geithner didn&rsquo;t pay the full amount of their taxes. They only paid part of their taxes. I doubt any honest taxpaper, non politican, could get away with such behavior. Sharpton is a bigger con man than any of the before mentioned. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Treasury Department officers say Sharpton owed $351,798 from 2007&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>$harpton has a long history of non-payment of debts and tax evasion.  When I owed back taxes, the government didn&rsquo;t hesitate to garnishee my wages until the debt was paid  &mdash;  I was offered NO deal.</p>
<p>This bears repeating from Larry Elder&rsquo;s column:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; In a 1988 interview, Sharpton said he saw no reason why blacks should pay taxes. &#8216;If we do not have a justice system that protects us, what are we paying for?&rsquo; Sharpton has faced multiple charges &mdash; and one conviction &mdash; of tax evasion&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll start paying taxes about the time he pays the judgment to Steven Pagones:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A jury unanimously concluded that Sharpton defamed Pagones, ordering Sharpton to pay $65,000 to Pagones. The Reverend promptly announced his intention not to pay. A couple years later, Sharpton&rsquo;s buddies passed the hat and paid off Sharpton&rsquo;s debt, which totaled $87,000 with interest and penalties&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>This charlatan and fool has been given pass after pass after pass  &mdash;  by the msm AND the government.</p>
