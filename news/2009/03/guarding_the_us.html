<h1>Guarding the U.S.-Mexico Border, Live From Suburban New York</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John D. Sutter, CNN, March 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When her baby girl takes an afternoon nap, or on those nights when she just can&rsquo;t sleep, Sarah Andrews, 32, tosses off her identity as a suburban stay-at-home mom and becomes something more exotic: a &#8220;virtual deputy&#8221; patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>From her house in a suburb of Rochester, New York, Andrews spends at least four hours a day watching a site called BlueServo.net.</p>
<p>There, because of a $2 million grant from the state of Texas, anyone in the world can watch grainy live video scenes of cactuses, desert mountains and the Rio Grande along Texas&rsquo; portion of the international border.</p>
<p>When Andrews spots something she deems suspicious  &mdash;  perhaps a fuzzy character moving from right to left across the screen or people wading through the river with what appear to be trash bags atop their heads  &mdash;  she and the site&rsquo;s 43,000 registered users can send e-mail messages straight to local law enforcement, who then decide whether to act.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The video site&rsquo;s supporters see the 15-camera project as a stride forward in U.S. efforts to halt illegal immigration, drug smuggling and border violence. Run by the Texas Border Sheriff&rsquo;s Coalition, an association of 20 sheriffs from border counties, the project seeks to spread responsibility for the border&rsquo;s security across the nation&rsquo;s masses of Internet users.</p>
<p>About 20 million people have clicked on BlueServo.net since it launched November 20, and the Web site has gained national attention at a time when many eyes already were focused on the southern border of the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals.</p>
<p>Although there have been no reports of vigilante groups using the site to make arrests, Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, a Democrat from El Paso, said the program is &#8220;pandering to these groups to keep them politically engaged on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program also has been widely criticized as ineffective in Texas newspaper editorials, as well as by some of the Web site&rsquo;s own users.</p>
<p>Since the site was launched in late November, only four arrests can be attributed to the cameras, said Don Reay, executive director of the sheriffs&rsquo; coalition, which runs the project with money from Texas Gov. Rick Perry&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cameras spy on stretches of the Texas-Mexico border where the border patrol isn&rsquo;t particularly active or where the border wall hasn&rsquo;t been constructed, Reay said. He declined to list locations of the cameras for security reasons but said most are hidden on existing structures on private properties.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Critics say the program tempts &#8220;extremists&#8221;(quotes mine) to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who exactly are these critics? Is it President Bush again, with the vigilante comment about the minutemen/women? The Mexican embassies in the U.S.? Or perhaps the critics are LA RAZA? Maybe Hilda Solis is a critic, a just appointed Secretary of Labor Reconquista, in the Obama Administration? Afterall, she said that anyone in the borders of the U.S. is a citizen. Who are these constant critics of American citizens concerned about their nation? One implication to note about this story is interesting. Notice how the concern about &#8220;extremist Americans&#8221;, is moving from the border, right into what Americans are doing in their own living room. These stories should be making Americans stomachs squirm with discomfort.</p>

			<p>When I started reading this article, I just knew there would be liberal whining about it.  Need I remind you these are the same liberals who love cameras on every corner of Chicago and London.</p>
<p>By &#8220;extremists,&#8221; Mr. Shapleigh means that radical fringe, only 70% of the people actually favor enforcing immigration law.  And by &#8220;trained professionals,&#8221; he means Federal immigration authorities who will look the other way because the Republocrat Party wants cheap labor/voters.</p>

			<p><i>But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals.</i><p></p>
<p>&#8220;Extremist&#8221; is the new code word for anyone who is not content with writing polite letters to his/her elected representatives. </p>
<p>If you expect something more than having your interests ignored by the elites (i.e. &#8220;working within the system&#8221;) and try to affect real change on your own, then you are an Extremist. </p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be long before all the Extremists are apprehended by the Trained Professionals for the good of the Civic Order.  </p></p>

<p>Who are doing such a wonderful job right! We now have loads of what I suspect are illegals here in S.C. and I doubt they flew here, so I suspect they walked here through the border states.</p>

			<p>Texas State Senator,Comrade Elliot Shapleigh, a Democrat(no!!)from El Paso, said the program is &#8220;pandering to these grouops to keep them politically engaged on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really,as opposed to what Comrade Senator, being &#8220;disengaged&#8221; on the issue of illegal immigration,as Democrats like you are?<br>
I didn&rsquo;t really feel like commenting on this idiotic fool, but I feel it&rsquo;s neccessary, not in order to say more about Democratic Senator Shapleigh&rsquo;s attitude, which is clear enough, but about liberals and their attitude towards illegal immigration.</p>
<p>I was listening to a well known progressive on the radio the other night, a health guru, and a man I respect for the knowledge he has in this area. He is always well informed and on the cutting edge, and seems moreover, like a basically good man. However, his views on illegal immigration are so typical of progressives. He likes to give his political views and as the program went on, he described what is going to happen to American cities, because of the breakdown of law and order in Mexico.</p>
<p>He rightly(in my opinion)explained how there are tens of thousands of gang members from Mexico in the United States and how organized they are. He said that as the economy collapses, these gangs, many of which have military training, will raid neighborhoods that are poor and middle class. They will do it in a very organized way, and quickly. Residents will be duct taped to their chairs as the gangs quickly remove cash and valuables, from the house and move on. He described how they will start fires in several areas to draw off the police,and will then strike in areas far from the police.</p>
<p>Mind you, this man is a liberal progressive, who believes that amnesty is proper,and that conservatives are basically clueless on social issues. He went on to say that as time progresses and the economy becomes worse, even the wealthy will be affected by gang violence, because their poor hispanic housekeepers, who basically hate their employers(his words not mine) will take payoffs from the gangs and will inform the gangs when the owner of the estate is not in and where the valuables are,etc.</p>
<p>Now after explaining the consequences of massive illegal immigration and the corruption that it creates, did this progressive fellow say anything at all about closing the borders, or cracking down on illegal aliens and gangs. No he did not!! He rather went on to vaguely say that we need to understand the reasons for these things. </p>
<p>Does this make it clear to concerned citizens, what we are up against with the liberal progressive attitude of people in the Democratic party? Can you now see the enormous obstacles in the way of concerned citizens, when it comes to solving some of Americas most serious problems?</p>
<p>Imagine that we might have millions of voters who think like the guy I described above. Can you now see why people like Comrade Senator Shapleigh, get re-elected, in spite of their attitude that illegal immigration is an issue that should not really &#8220;engage&#8221; us much as citizens;,and that being engaged with the issue might even be a sign that something is wrong with us? </p>

			<p>Yes,republicans see it as cheap labor and are traitors to big business,but the democrats see it as most likely the ticket to make sure there is never another republican president,which there is little difference in the two anyway. When you take the 30 to 50 million illegals,blacks and other minorities, I really see no way for a republican to have a chance. The leaders behind the curtain have finally completed America as a communist/marxist nation. Political correctness is communism when it&rsquo;s so purpose is to keep the people from saying the truth out loud. They must have chosen the least used area for illegals to cross if four is all they have caught. Who knows they may be reporting hundreds a night which go without action.If four is all that&rsquo;s been caught why is it even in the news? I think they might see how usefull this could be and how many Americans will put in the hours to report them and want to end this before its becomes effective.</p>

			<p>Ironically it is noble to use your computer to search for extraterrestrial alien life through SETI, but extremist to use your computer to search for terrestrial illegal aliens through BlueServo.net.</p>
<p>Since when does the employ of voluntary public &#8220;eyes and ears&#8221;, in this case an international border to identify possible illegal incursions as defined by law, become a suspect extremist behavior?  And 20 million have logged on, ahem that is 7% of the US population and maybe twice that in terms of those with computers.  Seems the BlueServo.net watchers are a sizable minority.  A minority whose rights deserve to be respected.</p>

			<p>Site is interesting. I saw nothing for a couple of days, but just a little while ago I spotted a small boat going from Texas side to Mexico side, returning form some kind of rendevous. I reported it. Kind of fun. And hopefully helps at least a little</p>

I wonder what that&rsquo;s supposed to mean?  And who determines what are &#8220;extremists&#8221;?</p>
<p>Also, I suspect that those critics would be, uh, &#8220;critical&#8221; of ANYTHING that served to apprehend illegal aliens.</p>

			<p>I just cannot understand why the politicians and people of the southwest are allowing themselves to be inundated with mexicans.</p>
<p>Why would anyone willingly allow themselves to be over-run with foreigners?</p>
<p>Why would anyone willingly allow politicians and pro amnesty organizations to exist?</p>
<p>Are all people with traditional values brain dead?</p>

			<p>That is a frightful scenario that Bobby described.  Wouldn&rsquo;t our government just love it if they could confiscate our guns so that we would not be able to defend ourselves from these criminal hordes?   We&rsquo;d be trying to defend ourselves with frying pans and pitch forks, but of course, the criminals would still have guns and who knows what else!  I think that the people in charge have lost their minds.</p>
<p>As always, STAY VIGILENT!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re mystified why?  I guess you&rsquo;ve never been in the Southwest.   Many of the &#8220;politicians and people&#8221; are themselves Mexicans. Or of Mexican descent.   Blood proves to be thicker than water.<br>

<p>I can at least tell you what happened in California as the critical turning point issue;  In 1990 - or thereabouts, CA had a Republican governor named Pete Wilson.  Under him, a proposition 188 was voted into law.  That proposition banned free health care, education and other support to illegals.  But instead of being voted into law, La Raza, MECHA and other Hispanic Reconquista organizations (that had made no secret of their Reconquesta intentions just earlier) sued and used the usual allegations of racism, discrimination, etc.  Enough lawmakers were convinced by their lawyers and businessmen to remove a law that the majority of Californians had just voted to institute after due process.  From there it has been a just a matter of Hispanics (mainly) sucking the blood out of California.  And of course we know that both as real estate agents and buyers, they were a big part of California&rsquo;s huge subprime bubble.</p>
<p>The influx of Mexicans and their crime affected my life personally.  My professional office was first tagged and later burglarized and completely ransacked to the point that I could not continue in business.  I tried for years, but I never have recoverd from the loss.  Now I am too old to be able to try as no one can restart a career that requires at least $40,000 to have a chance.  </p>
<p>I left California six years ago after two years in Europe and things were even worse.  I learned that in Sacramento, Hispanics would pack the gallery in the Assembly and disrupt whenever anyone put forth a proposition that was not in their interest.  Now, a majority of California lawmakers are Hispanic and Whites are a minority in California.</p>
<p>I apologize for the lengthly explanation, but I think I am a clear case in point here.<br>

			<p>I went to this site, signed up and quickly looked at a few cameras.  I felt uneasy when one camera showed another icon photo from another camera.  Checking it further, I found that the live streaming is not live streaming at all, but four hour videos.  I cannot imagine what reporting old activity can do in helping in the present.  Certainly no response can be made on the reports.  I have sent them an email query that I hope will satisfy me, but I fear that this may be a scam site, exploiting patriots for the revenue that their advertising may bring.  I first grew suspicious when in the sign up, they asked me if I wanted to speed up my computer and to &#8220;click here&#8221; if I wanted to - a well known web sale ploy that sucks the user into unnecessary services (or services you can easily provide for yourself for free) for your computer.</p>

			<p>This is one reason we need a real fence.  My belief is that if President Obama asked the American people to come up with the $3 billion that would be needed to build a fence that we would do it in the snap of a finger.  It could be done on a voluntary basis to make it all the more clear.  It sounds like a lot of money but with 300,000,000 people and counting that all we would need would be $10 per person.  Heck, I would pitch in double if that make up for some LaRaza slacker who would not pay.  </p>
