<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More black males in Louisiana are incarcerated or fall victim to homicide than white males, officials with an educational research center said Thursday.</p>
<p>And the amounts by which black males surpass their white counterparts in those and other unfavorable areas are drastic enough to warrant special attention, said state Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-New Orleans.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-American males are last in just about every category that measures the ability for success,&#8221; Richmond said.</p>
<p>The Council on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, which met Thursday at the State Capitol, plans to release a preliminary report June 1 on how black males in Louisiana are currently faring. {snip}</p>
<p>Among children, the percentage of black males in poverty is three times that of white males, said Bobbie DeCuir, a project director at the Cecil J. Picard Center for Child Development and Lifelong Learning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homicide is the leading cause of death for black males ages 15 to 34, said Gail Bonhomme, also a project director at the Picard Center.</p>
<p>And for every one white male age 19 to 44 that is incarcerated, about four black males of that age are incarcerated, she said.</p>
<p>Picard Center officials presented those and other statistics, taken from the National Center for Health Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau and compiled by LSU demographer Troy Blanchard, to the council.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those statistics were not surprising to council members, the majority of whom are black males themselves. But the figures evoked words like &#8220;sobering,&#8221; &#8220;depressing&#8221; and &#8220;stark&#8221; from the panel Thursday.</p>

			<p>How come there&rsquo;s no &#8220;depressing&#8221; or &#8220;dark&#8221; words for the state of whites?  Like the low birth rates? The massive non-white immigration to our countries?  The collective guilt we are supposed to have?</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;More black males&hellip;fall victim to homicide than white males&#8221;</i></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s left out is that more black males fall victim to homicide AT THE HANDS of BLACK MALES.</p>
<p>Until blacks take responsibility for the fact that they are responsible for their condition and their perception by others, there&rsquo;s no hope for change.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just disheartening,&rdquo; Bonhomme said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stop it. We&rsquo;ve got to do better. We&rsquo;re throwing away this precious human capital.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Precious human capital&#8221;. It&rsquo;s funny that under slavery, blacks allegedly built America. As free men, they can&rsquo;t maintain their own communities.</p>

<p>Building more prisons will solve the problem if their sentences are long enough for the many crimes they commit, because most of them have a propensity for crime.</p>

			<p> &#8220;Precious human capital&#8221;? They&rsquo;re joking, right? They&rsquo;re NOT? Then, if this &#8220;capital&#8221; is so precious, how come so much of it is in prison, dead by violence at very young ages (violence almost always committed by other black males), or &#8220;mired&#8221; in poverty? Or has dropped out of school before graduating? If it looks like a loser, sounds like a loser, smells like a loser   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s not &#8220;precious human capital.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The foregone conclusion of this panel is that pernicious white racism, and the evil white man&rsquo;s racist institutions, have kept the noble black man down.  If you start with the premise that &#8220;all races are the same&#8221; then there are really no other avenues of exploration.</p>

			<p>During a very dark period of my life, I was accepted by many Blacks. I think they could feel my angst, and identified with me.</p>
<p>On one dark December evening, I went to pick up my wife from work. I was then unemployed, and she had a wonderful career. </p>
<p>I sat on a bench waiting for her to come down, and stuck up a converstion with a Black man who was there. We talked a while, and he pulled out a bottle of some kind of whiskey and offered me a drink. I refused, but was stuck by his act of kindness, I was suffering so.</p>
<p>Today I am neither successful or unsuccessful. I am merely me.</p>
<p>But I no longer suffer, because my wife started believing in me, which started the slow healing of my soul.</p>
<p>The modern mystic, Stuart Wilde has written: &#8220;If the female will subjugate her ego and support the male unequivocally, the male goes beyond his identity crisis and begins to understand himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what happened to me, and I think this is the problem of the Black male  &mdash;  their females do not believe in them. Of course their mothers do, but they need more than that.</p>
<p>I suspect it was the liberals, who made the Black male obsolete to his woman and his family, who must bear much blame for this.     </p>

			<p>Well, I second that observation - quite an unusual one for this blog - about black women being &#8220;hard&#8221; on their men. Loudly so, too. I have never seen an Asian women berate a man publicly. In African-american culture it is a common occurrence. It is a growing phenomenon in white American culture, abetted by the masochism industry we call TV.</p>

			<p>While blacks are last in nearly every reasonable measure of success, the PC elite can always merely redefine &#8220;success&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blacks are very successful at rape, murder and armed robbery.</p>
<p>As politicians, blacks are very successful at offficial corrpution.</p>
<p>As consumers, blacks are successful at buying things they can&rsquo;t really afford, and then defaulting on mortgages and blowing off maxed-out credit cards.</p>
<p>Blacks are successful at reproducing out of wedlock, having kids that other people are then asked to support via the extortionate taxes blacks are successful at demanding we pay.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p>After years and years of entitlements, anti-White &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, welfare and trillions of dollars spent, Blacks are still failing miserably. </p>
<p>Perhaps all those leftist, liberal, egalitarians are wrong and there&rsquo;s differences between the races after all?</p>

<p>Black women tend to be very in-your-face&hellip;probably a reason why black men go for white women.</p>
<p>One time I saw an episode of &#8220;Divorce Court,&#8221; where a black man and a white woman were getting a divorce.  The black man  &mdash;  I kid you not  &mdash;  had this posterboard listing reasons why he prefers white women.  #1 on the list  &mdash;  more submissive/easily controlled.  Basically more easily manipulated.  My husband theorizes that black women know what their male relatives are like and don&rsquo;t fall for the black men&rsquo;s line of bull.</p>

			<p>I just ran a check on this organization and noted they have a council in several states, so I&rsquo;m assuming they&rsquo;re funded by the government.  I&rsquo;m writing my governor direct to let him know I&rsquo;m outraged by it, and ask how much this ethno-centric nonsense is costing white tax payers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to let the issue go away either.  I&rsquo;ll write another letter to the newspapers in my area, letting people know where their money is being spent.</p>

			<p>I know of one measure of success that African men excel, genetic success.  In the U.S., Black men father more children than White men. Thanks to the U.S. welfare state, most of these offspring reach maturity, whether or not, the father makes any contribution to their survival. </p>

			<p>No surprises here then but why is it that most African Americans do not recognise their self-inflicted problems and collectively work to correct them?  Or do I have to write the obvious and risk being called a racist again?  </p>
<p>As a retired engineer, I used to follow a Carl Drucker (American management theorist) &#8220;trouble shooting technique&#8221; principle which among other musts, says that to cure a problem, you must first positively identify what it is.  </p>
<p>Without doing that, you will not solve any problem.  But in thsi modern world, too may ignoramuses will not alow obviou to be publicised for fear of offending the offenders.</p>
<p>The problems are there for all to see, but the protaginists are blind   &mdash;   except for a handful who know.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m going to say something outside the usual parlance for Amren. I truly feel for %many black men. Lets not kid ourselves about something here   &mdash;   those programs &amp; subsidies that exist are nearly exclusively for *women* The majority of the homeless? Men! 99% of the federal funding? To women, and 90% plus of the private funding. Welfare? Thats for women&hellip; Black men can&rsquo;t even stay with their girlfriend in that, not by the rules of that system - not even for a night.  </p>
<p>(Yeah, okay, many do every now and then&hellip;but its a far cry from having your own place from it).   Other than disparate funding for schools (which women get even more of) [this funding includes raiding county school funds for city schools and college money], a ton of help getting into civil service and universities (of which women get even more of) - the only real program that exists for black men is PRISON. </p>
<p>Their girlfriend can get a shiny new place, help getting a car, free food, free tuition to school, free clothes for school and to job hunt, even electricity and natural gas subsidies   &mdash;   just for knocking a baby out.  For him? He is put on a yoke and chain for 22+ yeas of payments, missing even one prevents him from obtaining the one entitlement that was left - food stamps. </p>
<p>To be perfectly blunt, if we treated black women the same as black men - 60-70% of the prosperity of the black race would disappear overnight. </p>
<p>The programs that are in place are not there to bring families together and promote marriage, they do precisely the opposite. Bringing the father in simply cuts off the majority of her benefits. </p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t think fixing this will eliminate the black crime disparity, but I do think it would reduce it substantially.  <br>

			<p>As discussed in Rushton, African females don&rsquo;t need the males as much due to the lack of winter so they are much more independent than European females.  That is accentuated in the US since welfare goes directly to the female, eliminating any need for support from the father of the children.  If black males had to actually support their children, they would behave differently. </p>

<p>That couldnt be futher from the truth. They do recognize the problems and are actively trying fix them. There are some kids and adults who are not going to listen and thats why it is so crucial that they attack them when their young so they dont become a nucassance for the future. If you saw black in america on CNN you would see that there are alot of blacks not playing the victim role and are actively trying to fix their black neighborhoods. People like you who are trying to place labels and negative sterotypes which is what people from my generation are trying to stop. </p>

			<p>What would they expect to find? African American males are the descendants of slaves brought to America. </p>
<p>Who would end up being a slave even in Africa? Not the most successful and not the most advanced tribes but the least successful and most backward tribes. </p>
<p>If we were to take all the losers from any country in the world and group them togather would we expect some sort of success story?  </p>

			<p>I know for a fact, that in Minnesota the value of benefits showered on a single woman with children is AT A MINIMUM equivalent to a tax-free salary of $40,000. The key to the goodies is children. Theoretically, a single father would get the same but in how many cases does the father end up raising his illegitimate children alone.</p>

			<p>Reply to Daniel:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point. I have often thought that too. The Africans who were sent to the new world would naturally be the more dull-witted ones. THEY WERE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT. By other blacks I might add. It could also be mentioned that the slaves weren&rsquo;t chosen for any intelligence or skills, just the most menial manual labour.</p>

<p>This is abject nonsense! A hypothesis that has no supporting evidence whatsoever. During slavery, 80% of black households consisted of a man and a woman. It was so up to till the Civil Rights Movement. </p>

			<p>Every statistic is arrived at by blacks&rsquo; for blacks&rsquo;.  They do it all to themselves and most of them are proud to be what they are.  Still at stage one of the learning cycle; unconscious/incompetent.</p>
<p>Aside from sports and entertainment, the gene pool gets shallow.</p>
<p>Just imagine the unemployment rates, and dropout rates, and special privilege rates without affirmative action protocals.</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
