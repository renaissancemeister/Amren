<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frederick County public school students cannot be forced to disclose their citizenship status to county officials, the Maryland State Board of Education ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s unanimous decision was a response to an October 2008 petition by the Frederick County Commissioners. The commissioners sought legal permission to include immigration status with other information in student records.</p>
<p>Proponents of the status check argue that the issue is not removing illegal immigrant students from the school system, but determining the amount those students cost taxpayers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is trying to deny anybody anything,&#8221; said Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, also a county commissioner. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just that the taxpayers, the citizens, have a right to know the cost of educating the illegal community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenkins played a major role in other Frederick County immigration enforcement efforts, including the controversial policy of reporting illegal immigrants who have contact with police to federal authorities.</p>
<p>But school officials fear that requiring illegal students to disclose their status would have negative effects in the immigrant community, possibly driving those students out of schools altogether.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials on both sides agree that the number of immigrant students in Frederick County is rising, as evidenced by increases in English language courses for non-native speakers.</p>
<p>In 2007, 1,200 students participated in such classes, according to the annual Frederick County Public Schools Report. In 2008, that number increased to 1,346.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad to see they won&rsquo;t know how much illegals cost them until they go completely broke during the next fiscal year.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Maybe then, Maryland citizens will have to home school their kids and they&rsquo;ll get a decent education instead of a mind control, social engineering agenda.</p>
<p>Severe crisis can often be quite helpful.  Ask Rahm Emmanuel.</p>

			<p>Of course the left does not want us to know how much illegal immigrants are costing the taxpayers.  And in the unlikely event that the Maryland State Board of Education had approved such a tally, the ACLU would have sued.</p>

			<p>Ignoring the illegal immigration problem will not make it go away. Enforce our existing immigration laws, seal the border and denying services to illegal aliens will make the problem go away.</p>

			<p>the problem is the 1982 5-4 decision that forced school boards to educate illegal aliens. A lousy, poorly reasoned decision. Another unwarranted intrusion by courts into a matter reserved to the states.  Too bad Obama is President. too bad Anthony Kennedy is on the Court. This bad decision should be overturned. But it wont be. Not while affirmative action lover Obama and go with the wind Kennedy decide what happens on the Court.</p>
<p>Get rid of the millions of illegals in the schools and you save millions. They are expensive to educate with their low IQs and utter ignorance of AngloSaxon culture, which, if anyone remembers, is what schools in the USA should teach.</p>
<p>Instead, these illegal brats are dragging down the whole system.</p>
