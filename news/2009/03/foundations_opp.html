<h1>Foundations Oppose Call to Target Grants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Spector, Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A prominent philanthropy watchdog has riled some foundations by releasing a report suggesting they should devote half their grants to minorities, the poor and other disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The report, released this month by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, argued that foundations should meet a handful of benchmarks to practice &#8220;philanthropy at its best,&#8221; including making half their annual grants to &#8220;lower-income communities, communities of color and other marginalized groups, broadly defined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several foundation leaders have called that benchmark overly prescriptive and argued it could exclude philanthropies that pursue missions such as the arts, medical research and education  &mdash;  areas that might not always directly affect the groups identified by the committee. In addition, the committee lobbies Capitol Hill, so some fear the report could spur stricter regulation of foundations&rsquo; activities.</p>
<p>Criticism of the report has intensified in recent days, with a well-known foundation president blasting the report&rsquo;s findings on an Internet blog and another large foundation canceling its membership with the committee. The committee in turn circulated a memo attempting to shoot down criticisms.</p>
<p>Aaron Dorfman, the committee&rsquo;s executive director, said his group doesn&rsquo;t seek to codify the benchmarks and that he has been &#8220;surprised by the amount of venom&#8221; the report&rsquo;s suggestions have produced.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&rsquo;t have been clearer that this isn&rsquo;t intended to be a set of legislative suggestions or mandates in any way,&#8221; Mr. Dorfman said. &#8220;This is a document to spark discussions among the leaders of our nation&rsquo;s grant makers and to challenge them to be more responsive to marginalized communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate over the report comes as foundations face increased economic and political pressures. Foundation assets fell about 28% last year amid tumbling world-wide markets, according to the Council on Foundations, a Washington group that lobbies on behalf of more than 2,000 grant makers.</p>
<p>The committee&rsquo;s philanthropy benchmark report found that most foundations steer about a third of their grants toward &#8220;marginalized groups,&#8221; defined to include the poor, minorities, women, people with AIDS, the disabled, the elderly, immigrants and refugees, and crime and abuse victims, among others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the benchmark on grant allocations drew the most fire. Paul Brest, president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, called that proposal &#8220;breathtakingly arrogant&#8221; in a blog entry on the Huffington Post Web site.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t agree with it at all,&#8221; Mr. Brest said in an interview. &#8220;Whether you call it arrogant or inappropriate  &mdash;  you could imagine 10 different organizations deciding the most important issue is cancer&#8221; instead of marginalized communities, he said.</p>
<p>The California Wellness Foundation canceled its membership with the committee and asked for money to be returned after reviewing the report. {snip}</p>
<p>Many foundations, charities and nonprofit leaders endorsed the report. Among the most prominent was the Atlantic Philanthropies. Many critics are &#8220;misreading&#8221; the report, said Lori Bezahler, president of the Edward W. Hazen Foundation, another endorser.</p>

			<p>Question! Why does giving away millions of dollars of your own money demand or require a &#8220;watchdog&#8221;?!?  </p>

			<p>Charity should be a voluntary institution yet Marxists aren&rsquo;t content with the generosity of others unless it fits into their dogmatic worldview and would rather strongarm others into submitting to their will rather than allow good people to give as they see fit.</p>
<p>Marxists love to tell other people how to spend their own money. It never ceases to enrage me.</p>

<p>Why do I have the feeling that &#8216;poor&rsquo; and &#8216;disadvantaged groups&rsquo; excludes whites?</p>

<p>lol This is like conservatives arguing against hate crime legislation, doesn&rsquo;t over half their support already go towards these groups?</p>

			<p>In response to sbuffalonative&rsquo;s post - many of us don&rsquo;t realize that white people comprise majority of the poor in this country. The report treats actually does not limit the definition of economically disadvantaged to just &#8220;blacks&#8221; or &#8220;hispanics&#8221; or other non-white groups.</p>

			<p>Can anyone post pictures of the people making the decisions of where this money goes? And I see this entire phrase &#8220;&ldquo;lower-income communities, communities of color and other marginalized groups, broadly defined.&rdquo; as reading only blacks!!<br>

			<p>Forcing charitable foundations to act as a second welfare system will simply dry up donations.  The people who donate money to their favorite causes are already well-aware of the fact that they are free to give it away to professional welfare soaks instead.  The fact that they are not already handing their money over to these folks might - just might - be because THEY DON&rsquo;T WANT TO.</p>

<p>Of course they don&rsquo;t seek to codify these &#8220;suggestions&#8221; - <i>yet</i>.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny though about so many of the foundations that are complaining (Hewlett, for example) is that they are very, very PC. One day they&rsquo;ll wake up and realize they&rsquo;ve been pillaged by the very groups they supported.</p>
