<h1>Two out of Three Serious Teenage Criminals Are Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Netherlands Info Services (GM&rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch), March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two out of three serious teenage criminals are children of parents born outside the Netherlands. In most cases, no prison sentence is imposed, it emerges from a study sent to parliament by Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin.</p>
<p>In the research, 447 case files of youngsters aged from 12 to 17 were studied. All the files involved cases in which the perpetrator was convicted of a crime for which the maximum jail sentence is 8 years or more. These were murder, manslaughter, robbery with violence, extortion, arson, public acts of violence and sexual crimes.</p>
<p>Only just over one-third (37 percent) of the convicted youngsters are white Dutch. Two-thirds are of immigrant origin, meaning that they themselves or their mothers were born abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most prevalent group of youthful immigrants (among the perpetrators) are young Moroccans (14 percent),&#8221; according to the report. For another 14 percent, the parents&rsquo; country of birth could not be determined. A further 8 percent of the young criminals came from Turkey, 7 percent from Surinam and another 7 percent from the Netherlands Antilles, 9 percent from the category &#8216;other non-Westerners&rsquo; and 4 percent, &#8216;other Westerners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The report also reveals that most offenders did not have to go to jail. Although detention was imposed in 69 percent of the cases  &mdash;  whether or not in combination with community service  &mdash;  the sentences were largely suspended.</p>
<p>Some 25 percent of offenders only received suspended detention. Another one-third received a combination of suspended and real detention and just 11 percent, only an unconditional prison sentence.</p>
<p>Fourteen percent of the very serious crimes were committed by 12-13 year olds, 25 percent by 14-15 year olds, and 50 percent by 16-17 year olds. All very serious types of crime were more frequently committed by 16-17 year olds except sexual offences, for which the 14-15 year olds were the biggest group. Here, the 12-13 year olds also deliver &#8220;a large share compared with the other types of offences.&#8221;</p>
<p>The core question in the study was how judges deal with youngsters aged from 12 through 17 who commit very serious offences. Hirsch Ballin concludes &#8220;that the courts can operate adequately with the sentences and measures that youth criminal law offer them. The study offers a nuanced picture of the handling of serious youth cases,&#8221; according to the minister.<br>

			<p>They have three things going for them, that they will never go to jail.  1.  They committed their crime in a liberal race pandering country.  2.  They&rsquo;re under 18.  3.  They&rsquo;re non-white.</p>

<p>Well, they wanted diversity and they got it.</p>
<p>Too bad they were too stupid to know that multicultural societies always end up in bloody civil wars.</p>
<p>Like the other European multicults, they&rsquo;ll learn soon enough, but by then it will be too late.</p>

<p>Ummm&hellip;.so if their mother is white they are counted as white? Somebody better tell Obama he&rsquo;s white. And the children of white immigrants are lumped in with the Muslims?</p>

			<p>Leftists in Holland will respond to this report, not by criticizing these wonderful third-worlders, but by blaming white society and the gov&rsquo;t for not doing enough to help them &#8220;assimilate&#8221;.</p>

			<p>A few well-publicized executions would do wonders to decrease the crime rate.  Perhaps 20 or 30 young criminals would die - but hundreds of lives would be saved in the long run.  Maybe even thousands.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s no different in Germany. Turks as a group are the group least likely to integrate into mainstream society. This is caused by exteme nationalistic views held by most Turks and enhanced by religious views that make a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; society unlikely. The high crime rate among Turkish youths also reflect the difficult situation of young Turks who mainly speak Turkish in the home and in the peer group away from home. Turkish workers speak exclusivly Turkish even at the workplace making integration even there more difficult. For the most part Germans and Turks(3 million +) live in parallel societies but rarely coming together other than at the workplace.</p>

<p>Get that, 14-15 year olds were the biggest group committing sexual offences, in other words, rape. Yes, rape. An obvious conclusion that can be arrived at here (and a nauseating one) is that they are deliberately targeting young Dutch girls and these young girls would be roughly the same age, so therefore minors / children. Every victim of these atrocities committed by these aliens can thank their pathetic weak-kneed &#8216;leaders&rsquo; for the unaskedfor transformation of their own country. Not that they&rsquo;d think that, they&rsquo;d be thoroughly brainwashed by the education system for being white by then.</p>
<p>Hey, but there&rsquo;s an upside to diversity and multiculturalism in the Netherlands and every other European country - you can get a kabab with tabolleh&hellip;</p>

<p><br>
Here, the 12-13 year olds also deliver &ldquo;a large share compared with the other types of offences.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>What&rsquo;s up with all these Moroccans in the Netherlands? How and why did they get there? This can&rsquo;t be &#8220;imperial backwash&#8221; as that country was never part of some &#8220;Dutch empire&#8221;?</p>

			<p>Under the guise of protecting racial minorities, laws, programs, and practices discriminate in hiring and promotion, in access to loans for business and housing, in college admission and scholarships, and in numerous other ways that affect livelihoods of Whites. Showing favoritism to any individual simple because of race is not only incongruous, but harmful&hellip; true equality may only be achieved by merit, and intellectual capacity.</p>

<p>Germans are really weird people. Funny at the same time, too.</p>
<p>You better start distinguishing Turks, Arabs and Kurds&hellip; 50% of the &#8220;Turks&#8221; in Germany are either Kurds or any other people from the Southwest of Turkey.</p>
<p>Turks in Germany are extremely nationalistic because of the PKK terrorists who freely hang out across Europe, threaten Turks and non-pkk supporter Kurds and collect money for PKK.</p>
<p>Germany consciously took many Islamists from Turkey like the US where the head of all Islamists, Fetullah Gulen live like a king and isn&rsquo;t deported back to Turkey. Now complaining about Islam? C&rsquo;mon! You reap what you sow.</p>
<p>Just rip your passport on the plane. Once you landed in Germany, claim asylum that you&rsquo;ll be killed if you return Turkey (nobody is being killed, of course). Once you get your residence permit, you can work illegally while you get free housing, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>I think there is not a problem with living in seperated societies as long as people do not cause trouble, reap benefits and pay their taxes. That&rsquo;s the reason why Asian immigrants are preferred everywhere over Blacks, Hispanics or Muslims by a factor of 100000X.</p>
<p>On the other side, people from Europe speak exclusively their own languages, live in gated communities in our beautiful and shiny South where their flag fly and the Turks are not allowed to enter. Please integration, haha.</p>
<p>I am extremely sure that Turks are the only people in Germany who are expected to integrate (or better assimilate). If you speak only English, you don&rsquo;t have to integrate or even don&rsquo;t have to learn German. I doubt how many Americans/Englishmen-women, Italians, Spaniards, etc&hellip; hang out with Germans or do they stick to their communities, too?</p>
<p>By the way, the real crime rate among Turks are not as high as Arabs or/and Central/(South)Eastern Europeans. A distortion of statistics is extremely easy where a substantial percentage (~30%) of foreigners hail from one single country.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s keep things separate here, the Arabs (Kuwait and Saudi) are Caucasian and the muslims causing trouble in Europe are BLACKS from various African countries. The Saudis are using the blacks as shock troops to go in and upset things while they (Saudis) just finance and direct!</p>

<p>I agree with you on that. It&rsquo;s true that the lowest class of Turks were sent to Germany to work (even illegitimate, mostly very religious, mostly from the Southwest). </p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t rape girls (Somali in Norway &amp; Sweden), burn or steal cars (France) or attack government buildings (France again). They may be uneducated, somehow stupid people but they aren&rsquo;t traitors like those who work and live in Europe and are hostile to it. I think the low criminality in Germany proves that.</p>
<p>However, I am sure that many people on AmRen would change their views if they would visit the country.</p>

<p>Wm. Cutting (despite the deceptive name) is probably a Turk;  that explains his defensiveness and lack of objectivitity on this matter.   He is obviously not an Englishman, nor an American, nor a German. His English, while good, is not perfect nor natural. No English-speaker would write as bizarrely as he does.</p>

<p>What is that supposed to mean?  Twenty-five percent of  &#8220;very serious crimes&#8221; were committed  by 14-15 year olds, and 50 percent by 16-17 year olds! <br>
Yet we&rsquo;re told the system operates &#8220;adequately&#8221;????   Who&rsquo;s kidding anyone? <br>
And btw, there is a real &#8220;Dutch&#8221; name for you! </p>

<p>The ARABS!! are not in the Netherlands committing crimes, it is the NORTH/EAST AFRICAN BLACKS and Turkish muslims doing it, the Arab muslims such as Saudi are their handlers and financiers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Turk living in Germany who is interested in the issues on Amren. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned it in my previous comments. I am not a native speaker, hence my English is not perfect (but I&rsquo;m learning).</p>
<p>The name is from the movie &#8220;Gangs of New York, starring Daniel Day Lewis&#8221;. It&rsquo;s just a nickname, not a deception.</p>
