<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/us/02muslims.html?_r=2&amp;ref=us">Poll Finds U.S. Muslims Thriving, but Not Content</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laurie Goodstein, New York Times, March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Gallup poll of Muslims in the United States has found that they are far more likely than people in Muslim countries to see themselves as thriving.</p>
<p>In fact, the only countries where Muslims are more likely to see themselves as thriving are Saudi Arabia and Germany, according to the poll.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still a sense among American Muslims of being excluded from the mainstream,&#8221; Mr. Younis [Ahmed Younis, a senior analyst at the Muslim studies center.] said, &#8220;and among young people that&rsquo;s more acute.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It never stops does it? It is one nonwhite group after another to dump on Whitey in our own country. Nobody, most of all us, asked them to come here in the first place. In fact I believe most of us would love to see all of them pack up and leave. The only race in this country that is falling and not thriving in any way is the White race. WE built and formed this country for our own progeny, not for theirs and yet we are the ones getting the shaft.</p>

			<p>Of course you have a sense of being excluded from the mainstream, because you AREN&rsquo;T mainstream. Just as I wouldn&rsquo;t feel &#8220;mainstream&#8221; if I chose to move to the Middle East, Japan, Mexico or Africa. So what&rsquo;s your point???</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these American muslims are NOT (in general) the Arab, middle east type of muslim, they are mostly the lazy, shiftless, entitled thug black converts we are so familiar with. The true muslim Arabs from Saudi and Kuwait are sending their soldiers into the EU to assist in the take over there.</p>

			<p>All other Islamic countries are yours to be mainstreamed in.</p>
<p>America belongs to us, where our basic belief of freedom super-cedes the entangled dictations of a political religion.</p>
<p>You are free to make better choices and prosper!</p>

			<p>They will not feel included and satisfied until they are 60 years old with 3 muslim wives of their own, 15 ugly Muslim children and then they insist on the right to take a 4th wife, your 16 year old daughter.</p>
<p>If you object to their efforts of &#8220;inclusion&#8221; expect to be dragged in front of American versions of the Alberta Canada Human Rights Tribunal - you will be grilled by some PC marxist White woman who&rsquo;s probing questions are designed to determine what was your &#8220;intent&#8221; in rejected the marriage offer?</p>
<p>In these situations, the best defense is a good offense. Never ever taking any gruff from any PC human rights tribunal. Stick to your 1st Amendment rights for free speech and be honest in saying that you like Islamic extremist more than you do these bitter, idiot PC marxist white women who sit on these human rights tribunal.</p>

			<p>&#8220;American Muslims see themselves as excluded from the mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite interesting; murder 3000 innocent Americans and the rest don&rsquo;t want you around.  Is anyone claiming to be suprised at this phenomenon?</p>

			<p>In Central Florida we are mostly run over by Puerto Ricans (at least they have some kind of claim, as citizens), Haitians (god knows how these people get over here, and what they do once they are here), plus Hondurans and Mexicans.  But I was recently in a side of town I usually never get to, and was surprised to see numerous women wrapped up in their Muslim costumes.  These were not blacks, nor submissive white women, but indigenous Middle  Easterners.  THAT shocked me.  It&rsquo;s hard not to think of the US in the past tense, and in Star Trek terms: &#8220;It&rsquo;s life Jim, but not life as we know it.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Being &#8220;mainstream&#8221; is nice if you have it, but it&rsquo;s not an entitlement, nor is it necessary to lead a good life.</p>
<p>The only way Muslims will be &#8220;mainstream&#8221; is if they are the majority. What do they think &#8220;mainstream&#8221; means?</p>

<p>Muslims have never been &#8220;mainstream&#8221; in the West because Islam is not the &#8220;prevailing current of thought&#8221;.</p>

Well, they ARE apart from the mainstream! So?  What do they want? That&rsquo;s what they accepted when they came here.</p>
<p>If I went to live in China, I would be distinct from the mainstream too. It&rsquo;s part of the package when you move to another country with a different race, religion, culture.<br>
If they wanted to be part of the &#8220;mainstream&#8221;, they should have remained in the Moslem world where they would fit right in.</p>

			<p>President Obama&rsquo;s new presidential order should give them some company. A few hundred thousand pro-Hamas Muslim Palestianians are on their courtesy of the American taxpayer.</p>

			<p>If they were so content in their native stink-holes, whey did they leave?  Do they believe that once they flood this nation with their ilk, and their ideas and behaviors, that it will somehow be different (and better) here than what they left behind?  When Africans take over an area in the U.S. (like Detroit or New Orleans) it eventually becomes a little mini-Africa.  Why should we expect a difference if muslims take over an area or region in the United States.  If their cultures were so great, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to leave!</p>

<p>Again!!! most of these trouble making muslims in the U.S. are black American muslim converts that have simply  added another dimension to their incessant whining. The added benefit to being a muslim is sthat now they can whine about RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION and get more stuff!! If they don&rsquo;t get more stuff, they become &#8220;outraged&#8221; and riot (as usual)</p>

			<p>A Muslim &#8220;mainstream&#8221; in Europe or North America would create precisely the same sort of conditions that made them want to leave the Middle East in the first place.</p>
