<h1>Vancouver Police Admit They Have a &#8216;Gang War&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CTV (Scarborough, Ontario), March 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vancouver police say their city is now the &#8220;battleground&#8221; in a deadly &#8220;gang war,&#8221; admitting on Friday to what has become increasingly obvious to a weary public.</p>
<p>There have been 12 fatal shootings around metro Vancouver since late January, including gunshots every night this week.</p>
<p>In a bid to reassure a shell-shocked public, police announced Friday they had arrested five alleged gangsters, including the two purported ringleaders.</p>
<p>Police also put a number of seized items on display, including an AK-47, handguns and a bullet-proof vest.</p>
<p>&#8220;As police, we&rsquo;ve always been told by media experts to never say or admit that there is a gang war,&#8221; Vancouver Chief Const. Jim Chu said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&rsquo;s get serious. There is a gang war and it&rsquo;s brutal.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the third news conference held this week addressing the gang war.</p>
<p>On Monday, the RCMP and Vancouver police announced five arrests. Two days later, Chilliwack RCMP said they arrest two people accused of illegally importing ammunition.</p>
<p>But, none of charges announced Friday were related to serious gun charges or violence.</p>
<p>Friday&rsquo;s arrests include:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;58-year-old Udam Singh Sanghera, who was picked up on Feb. 23rd, and charged with seven counts of unauthorized firearm possession.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;31-year-old Barjinder (Bobby) Singh Sanghera. He was picked up on November 8th, and charged with six counts of unauthorized firearm possession.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Gordon Robert Taylor, 42, was also charged with unauthorized firearm possession.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;24-year-old Tejinder Singh Malli, who was picked up on Feb. 18, and charged with break and enter.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;28-year-old Bimal Datt Sharma, who was arrested on Feb. 18, and charged with break and enter.</p>
<p>Vancouver Insp. Mike Porteous said the men arrested are tied to two notorious gangs in the west  &mdash;  the Red Scorpions and the United Nations gang.<br>

			<p>I think that this Gordon Robert Taylor isn&rsquo;t ganged up at all, he&rsquo;s just a convenient white face that just happened to possess a gun in a way that technically violates Canadian or Provincial law, so they had to put him up to show that they&rsquo;re not being racist or doing profiling.</p>
<p>Every time there&rsquo;s some gang bust, I always see on TV that the cops put together a rostrum of guns to show off.  As if that makes me feel safer   &mdash;   they get all of the guns but very few of the people, who, unless they get convicted of first degree murder, will be back out on the streets really soon, back to their old thing.  I wish TV would show pictures of the people arrested, not the guns.  Oh no, too un-PC.  </p>

			<p>Multiculturalism is the idea that the more different people are, the better they will get along.  Anyone who still believes that multiculturalism and diversity are strengths, instead of extremely dangerous weaknesses is an idiot.</p>

			<p>Wha..? What kind of names are those? They look east Indian to me. I didn&rsquo;t know there were Indian gangs in North America. Does anyone know anything about this?</p>
<p>I never heard of &#8220;the Red Scorpions and the United Nations gang.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haha.  The snobbish politicians up north criticize us for so much non-white crime, saying it&rsquo;s due to &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting there.  Let&rsquo;s see what their story is when their crime problem is as bad as ours.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, &#8220;Diversity is their strength.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wherever there&rsquo;s drugs, you&rsquo;ll usually find guns.<br>
it&rsquo;s all about the biggest $$ making industry <br>
on the planet : illegal drug running.</p>
<p>Other than the facist quasi-corporation known as &#8216;the United States&rsquo;, which fleeces it&rsquo;s subjects continuously, the drug business is the most lucrative and indeed competitive.</p>

			<p>Almost everyone with Singh in their name is a Sikh.  I don&rsquo;t know why, but for some reason the Sikhs in Canada have done as well as other Indians in either Canada or America.  </p>

			<p>You never heard of the United Nations gang? They started out as a street gang in San Francisco. (sarcasm=off)</p>
<p>From Wikipedia (Where the Facts Are What We Say They Are):</p>
<p>&#8220;On 25 April 1945, the UN Conference on International Organization began in San Francisco, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the Charter of the United Nations.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When there were just white people in Vancouver there were no gang problems.</p>
<p>You can thank the policiticans since Trudeau for the uncontrolled immigration of trash and the gang wars.</p>

			<p>The Sikhs started out as agricultural labourers in the 30s to 50s in the farmlands south of Vancouver.  Most of the gang related activity seems to be 1st and 2nd gen immigrants though.  They&rsquo;ve managed to acquire a near monopoly on many industries in Vancouver including aeroport work, construction, and (of course) taxi-cabs.  </p>
<p>There are definitely white gangs in Vancouver, too.  There are Greek, Portuguese, Italian, and Russian &#8220;social clubs&#8221;.  Up to late 80s there were also small-time white gangs including the East Van Saints, the Clarke Parkers, etc. They were completely displaced by the Big Circle Boys (Chinese) and the Viet-Ching (Chinese-Vietnamese)by the 90s. It seems like whenever the non-white gangs kill each other, there is a big fuss in the media about &#8220;gang-related violence&#8221; and it ends up in a crack down on the Hells Angels, who seem to restrict their very occasional violence to narrow targets for specific reasons.  </p>

			<p>  And now Canada will reap its grand reward for such wonderful, heartfelt diversity. Isn&rsquo;t it grand how the streets have become so diverse? You can listen to a thousand different languages make fun of you, and eat filthy dishes from around the third world while dodging a hail of gunfire. Oh, and if you are really blessed with diversity, your children will get the experiences of a lifetime also. And since the government has disarmed all of you, maybe you can throw rocks at the third world perps as they spray you with automatic gunfire. Canada sure knows how to take care of its taxpayers, doesn&rsquo;t it? Hmmmm,, it seems the U.S. may be planning on borrowing the Canadian playbook. I sure am glad I live in the times such as these. I get to watch history being replayed. The western countries are the new Roman Empire. Nobody seems to have learned a damn thing from history. This time, not only will a culture disappear, but a race of people. Too bad, the victor writes the history books, I am afraid that our white race will be completely forgotten. All our accomplishments will be accredited to other peoples. Nobody will ever know the difference. I cannot believe that we are set to lose our fight for existence, how could we have been mislead and misdirected as to cause our own destruction? Is it a character flaw? I am struggling for an answer. And I refuse to go quietly into the night. I amy lose the battle, and even worse, the war. But at least for a generation or two, I will be remembered. And not for being a coward.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Vancouver gang violence linked to Mexico</p>
<p>March 03, 2009</p>
<p>THE CANADIAN PRESS</p>
<p>The increase in gang violence on the streets of Vancouver and other Canadian cities has direct ties to the grisly drug-cartel wars that have terrorized Mexico and some American border towns, say Canadian and U.S. police.</p>
<p>Violence has reached a fever pitch in parts of Mexico where the government of President Felipe Calderon has sent in 45,000 soldiers and 5,000 federal police to try to curb cartel activity. More than 7,000 have died in the last two years, with 1,000 deaths this January alone.</p>
<p>The United States has felt the impact, with the cartels sending assassins across the border and more and more cells springing up across the country to distribute cocaine from the south.&#8221;</p>
