<h1>Supreme Court: Insulting Islam Is Not Insulting Muslims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Netherlands Info Services (GM&rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch), March 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court yesterday produced an important ruling in principle in favour of freedom of speech. The highest court of the Netherlands acquitted a man of insulting Muslims although he dubbed Islam a tumour.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court quashed a ruling by an appeal court in Den Bosch. As had a district court earlier, the appeal court did find the man guilty. Yesterday&rsquo;s acquittal can have consequences for all future court cases on insulting followers of a faith or ideology, including the notorious case against MP Geert Wilders.</p>
<p>According to the country&rsquo;s highest court, people expressing themselves offensively about a religion are not automatically guilty of insulting its followers, even if the followers feel insulted. &#8220;The statement must unmistakeably refer to a certain group of people who differentiate themselves from others by their religion,&#8221; ruled the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court acquitted a man who in November 2004 stuck a poster in his window with the text: &#8216;Stop the tumour that is called Islam&rsquo;. While people may not insult believers, they can insult their religion, according to the Supreme Court. &#8220;The sole circumstance of offensive statements about a religion also insulting its followers is not sufficient to speak of insulting a group of people due to their religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The appeal court in Den Bosch had ruled that &#8220;in view of the bonds between Islam and its believers,&#8221; as well as being unnecessarily offensive to Islam the poster was also offensive for those who practise Islam. But &#8220;the appeal court thereby gave too wide an interpretation of the expression &#8216;a group of people according to their religion&rsquo;, as it occurs in Article 137c.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case was about Article 137c of the Criminal Code, which makes offensive statements about a group of people an offence. It was not about incitement to hatred or discrimination, the Supreme Court stressed.</p>
<p>Party for Freedom (PVV) leader Wilders, meanwhile internationally known for his struggle against Islam, will be tried for insulting Muslims as a group. The court that will handle his case will have to take yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling into account.</p>
<p>Originally, the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office (OM) did not want to prosecute the MP, because it did not consider any of his statements a punishable offence. But in January, an appeal court in Amsterdam ordered the OM to change its mind.</p>
<p>As well as for insulting Muslims, Wilders will also be on trial for incitement to hatred and discrimination against Muslims. When the Wilders case will come to court is not yet known.<br/>

			<p>So the Dutch Supreme Court seems to be saying it was legal for a man to post a sign saying &#8220;Stop the tumor that is called Islam&#8221; but it would NOT be legal had he posted a sign saying &#8220;Stop the tumors called Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talk about pretzel logic&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;When the Wilders case will come to court is not yet known.&#8221;</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t.  They will do some typically duh-tch backroom deal and fine him.  A trial will allow him an easy majority in the next election which these idiots never thought about when they filed this absurd complaint.</p>

			<p>I live in rural France. </p>
<p>A once underpopulated region is filling up with British and Dutch people escaping the nightmares that their respective nations have become. French people from Frances big cities are arriving too.</p>
<p>It is such a delight to live amongst people who look like me, think like me and share a common European/Christian culture.</p>
<p>Its safe, clean, friendly and prosperous.</p>
<p>But for how long.</p>

			<p>Am I missing something?   This splitting of hairs seems like nonsense to me.</p>
