			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News (Toronto), March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Ontario Superior Court judge has ordered a pair of website owners to turn over identifying information about eight people being accused of defamation after posting anonymous comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my view, the defendants are under an obligation to disclose all documents in their power and control,&#8221; Justice Stanley Kershman said in a ruling delivered Monday to defendants Connie Wilkins-Fournier and Mark Fournier of Kingston, Ont., who run the website Free Dominion.</p>
<p>Kershman also ordered the couple to pay $5,000 in costs to the plaintiff in the case, Ottawa human rights lawyer Richard Warman, described by Kershman as an &#8220;anti-hate speech advocate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warman had requested, for use in a court action, access to documents that would assist in identifying the anonymous posters and their locations, such as:</p>
<p>* Email addresses and all personal information.</p>
<p>* The IP addresses of their computers.</p>
<p>* Documents concerning the establishment and operation of the website, such as hosting agreements, billing information, and website registrant names.</p>
<p>The Fourniers had argued that people using the message boards do so with the expectation of anonymity and may make statements or provide information that they wouldn&rsquo;t normally with family, friends or co-workers.</p>
<p>However, Kershman cited a 2004 case that said privacy cannot be used to protect a person from the application of civil or criminal liability, and that privacy rights must be balanced against the rights of other interests and the public interest.</p>
<p>He also cited a 2008 child pornography case, in which a judge ruled that a person&rsquo;s name, address and the name of their spouse are not information that one would expect to keep private from the state under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Fournier, posting on the Free Dominion website late Monday, said the ruling has a number of implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most importantly it means that anyone can gain access to a Canadian forum owner&rsquo;s confidential records on its members simply by filing a lawsuit (that could later be dropped) against the forum operator.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, he said the couple did not have the funds to appeal and will likely have to comply with the ruling.</p>
<p>University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, posting on his blog Tuesday, expressed concern that the decision &#8220;feels like a judge anxious to order disclosure, despite the weight of authority that provides some measure of privacy protection for anonymous posters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geist said the court must ensure that a proper balance is struck between the rights of a plaintiff and the privacy and free speech rights of an anonymous poster. In order to do that, it must set a high bar for plaintiffs to meet in order to justify overriding the poster&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>The website in question is described in the ruling as &#8220;so controversial that it is blocked to employees of the Ontario Public Service&#8221;  &mdash;  something that Geist said is &#8220;not much of a threshold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warman is in the process of suing the Fourniers, alleging they &#8220;falsely and maliciously published and circulated&#8221; information on the site that claimed Warman had posted hateful, racist words. The allegations have not been proven in court.<br>

			<p>If you have something controversial to say on the internet in Canada, go to a public library and do it. The best the Mounties can do is track it to a library computer, not to any identifiable individual. Canada&rsquo;s elite are liberals. In regard to freedom of speech for conservative viewpoints, it really shows.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how all this works, but maybe they ought to move the website over to a U.S. based ISP, then say that American laws prohibit divulging that sort of info, since freedom of speech in not a crime in the United States&hellip;..yet.</p>

<p>This sort of monitoring is being done to us U.S. citizens as we type!! I&rsquo;m sure some of us will, sooner or later, have visits from the MIB especially after Ms. Clinton gets her way about weapons. Weapons and ammo are our friends, get them while we can.</p>

			<p>Richard Warman is a well-known agitator for internet censorship in Canada.  Michael Geist is known for defending freedom on the internet.</p>
<p>Warman operated in obscurity for years, but is increasingly under attack as a light is being shone on his activities.  Canadians are repelled by his under-handed methods, his base fanaticism when dealing with others he disagrees with, and his attempts to use the powers of the state for his agenda.    </p>

			<p> These leftists are going to regret this one day. They<br>
are hypocrites of the biggest kind. They&rsquo;re self appointed<br>
champions of free speech and expression. Until it goes<br>
against their dogmatic worldview. This reminds me of<br>
another time in history, when speaking freely and self<br>
expression was dangerous. It was the inquisition, and<br>
any opinion contrary to the dogmas at that time was<br>
punishible by prison and possible death. So what will<br>
these leftist do when their opinions are no longer<br>
&#8220;fashionable&#8221;. And the anti free speech laws they<br>
championed, come back to haunt them. By declaring <br>
them the evil ones ? They should watch what they<br>
wish for. </p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t someone already exposed in a &#8216;sting&rsquo; like this? An uber-liberal Canadian exposed for making offensive comments, while posing as a conservative on a message board? If done properly, full disclosure could help weed out the liberal academics who make it their duty to monitor, and even try and control these far-right groups. Men of conscience can do no less. By that I&rsquo;m referring to maximum discloser efforts, of course. After all, there is not a truth existing which one should fear or wish unknown to the world. </p>

<p>Not only that, I&rsquo;m sure that there are computer programs and proxy sites that can easily and totally anonymize your identity while surfing at home. I&rsquo;m sure that they&rsquo;ll try to force that genie back into the bottle, but it isn&rsquo;t going back in. </p>
<p>Judges in the U.S. and Canada are so totally power drunk that they can&rsquo;t recognize that there are limits to their power. </p>

			<p>This Warman is a real piece of work.  But you&rsquo;ve got to hand it to them: the anti-racists have things under lockdown.  That&rsquo;s because all every &#8220;race-realist&#8221; and his dog ever do is post the same mind-numbingly consistent bunch of complaints over and over and over and over again and thinking they are &#8220;doing&#8221; something.</p>

			<p>Better yet, go to an Internet cafe.  At our public library, you have to sign in and show ID, and you&rsquo;re assigned a computer.  So they could still track you down.</p>

			<p>Canada is a totalatarian police state. Canadians are paying a terrible price for the Taudeau worshipping decades earlier.</p>
<p>The more unbearable race replacement becomes in Canada, the more nastier the comments towards non-whites. If a large number of White Canadians simultaneously made nasty comments about non-whites immigrants. It would be much more difficult for the Canadian goverment to censor. Of vourse the Canadian goverment may decalre war agianst the White Canadian majority. But if it does, the consensus necessary to keep it in power will collapse. This would be the first step in the revolt and the sweeping away of the Canadian goverment.</p>
<p>There is safety in numbers.</p>

			<p>The people of Canada are being told to go underground to express their honest thoughts to avoid being punished by the state. Does Stan really think he can outlaw having enemies, or expressing something about them? If enemies were only dispensed with so easily.</p>

<p>Sad but true.  However, every movement needs both leaders and followers.  I&rsquo;m hoping that this next election cycle produces at least a few real leaders, but until the movement has some chance to succeed, it does us no good to forfeit our jobs and possibly go to jail for expressing our beliefs.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does this [library internet privacy] apply to the US as well? There have been a few times that I&rsquo;ve had to use a library computer and had to log on using my library card number   &mdash;   and of course the library has your name, address, phone number&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have been more specific. (I&rsquo;m the one who posted at 10:31 PM on March 26.) I am in the US and the majority of libraries that I happen to use do not require patrons to log on the internet with their library card number. Such a requirement obviously would compromise your privacy. If your library merely requests you to sign a piece of paper without having to show ID, then you can just scribble a pseudonym.  Otherwise, an internet cafe would be the best alternative, so long as you only pay with cash. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it sad that jerks like Richard Warman advocate against speech they don&rsquo;t like by using &#8220;human rights&#8221; as their legal tool? Perhaps they don&rsquo;t understand Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?  </p>

<p>Posting the same &#8216;mind-numbingly consistent bunch of complaints over and over&rsquo;, I agree has limited merit to those who have heard the same complaints over and over. But to newer arrivals it least it shows that race realists still have a voice, and that not everyone has drunk the kool-aid.</p>
<p>Our presence gives other similar people permission to feel the same way, in so at least it&rsquo;s cathartic. </p>
<p>I especially wonder if I am wasting my precious time here partially because of my geographic location and I also think that maybe I/we should leave the commenting to the 0.01% of WN Phd&rsquo;s (figure completely made up) out there for credibility&rsquo;s sake, but then would less be more? Sure the academic elite should do all the talking at the end of the day but then nobody is an island or knows it all.<br>
And sometimes the factory workers perspective is the most valuable of all, specifically pertaining to events in and around factory working of course. You get my point.</p>
<p>And if there was only the liberal point of view out there, it would be like a admission that we are/were wrong.</p>
<p>And neither side can be 100% right (for everybody at least).</p>
<p>The way things are going at least we&rsquo;ll have bragging rights, &#8220;I told you so&#8221;.<br>
Most points of view are a matter of perspective.<br>
Like some of the phrases that are bandied around these days &#8216;Progress&rsquo; (for who?), &#8216;change&rsquo;(from what to what exactly?), &#8216;affirmatve action&rsquo;(affirmative for who exactly, the white guy who&rsquo;s been displaced because of his skin color, I don&rsquo;t think so), &#8216;positive discrimiation&rsquo;(again positive for whom exactly?) and &#8216;reverse discrimination&rsquo;(reverse, hmm so discrimination goes only one way hey, intersting).<br>
Again as the status quo the perspective that everything is being judged on is not ours.  </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on the outside of any movement, you tend to simpify it, probably due to ignorance (I do it all the time myself).</p>
<p>For instances if I say the word &#8216;white&rsquo; retaining to anything nationalistic, I often find myself frustratingly having to explain that it has nothing to do with gas chambers and the like to those who have a preconcieved idea of what that entails. <br>
Another example, my mother was outwardly a ultra-liberal, race mixing feminist but even she would cop flak from the more hardcore feminists who were so commited that they had renounced men all together, one of them wore purple from head to toe 24/7 in the honor of womans sufferage and they would spend most of the week protesting and holding signs (I think it was outside the local courthouse) trying to get this infamous local, woman who was found guilty of murder, an appeal based on the battered wife syndrome.</p>
<p>And from frequenting this site I&rsquo;ve witnessed discussions that are pro gun/ anti gun, pro religion/ anti regilion, pro conservative and anti, attitudes that are the more solider like &#8216;white nationalist&rsquo; or more live and let live &#8216;race realist&rsquo;, seperatist/ supremist, pro big families/ anti any babies, confessed race mixers/ and those who are proudly homogenous, pro America (as the idea)/or just over it and so on. <br>
If you look at our movement and compare it to 50 years ago it has evolved greatly like everything it has to, to stay relevant.</p>
<p>I find it fasinating that even in the world of the politically incorrect (us), there is a form of political correctness.</p>
<p>And where will the Jared Taylors of the next generation get their inspiration from?<br>
To borrow the rhetoric of the left, one person can make a difference and who knows what mighty oaks will grow from the acorns that are planted here.<br>
And like the housing bubble that burst, eventually the population bubble will burst too, and there will be lots of tears and heart ache and finger pointing. But it is just the way of the world. </p>
<p>And it will continue spinning around the sun and going the cycles of birth and death, day and night long after we&rsquo;re all gone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give in guys, our ancestors didn&rsquo;t. Which is why we&rsquo;re here.</p>

<p>Or, the best thing to do, is wait a while longer and Canadian society will be as chaotic as ours.  There will be no time for the government thugs to harass innocent whites.  They&rsquo;ll be too busy dodging bullets and pitchforks from the third world rabble they love so much.</p>
<p>Some of you here are still in denial as to the outcome of this collapse, but time will prove me right.</p>
<p>The great thing about being right in an instance such as this is that arguing a point isn&rsquo;t necessary.  All that&rsquo;s necessary is to wait a while and the circumstances will unfold all on their own in due time revealing in living color just exactly the point of an argument.</p>

<p>Not so easy.   They will have the name of the person who signed up for it, and your library card number which you must use.  Then, Gotcha!</p>
<p>YOu could go to a commercial establishment. But they are clamping down too.  Abroad (in Milan) I had to produce my passport just to use a computer!  Expect that sort of thing here too, in time.</p>

<p>In my library, you STILL have to use the bar coding on your library card to activate it or you can&rsquo;t get online. You can&rsquo;t do anything anymore without that library card! It&rsquo;s all electronified now. You could try going to another branch and ask to use it as an out-of-town visitor, but you would still have to present identification and obtain a visitor&rsquo;s pass. No getting around it!</p>
