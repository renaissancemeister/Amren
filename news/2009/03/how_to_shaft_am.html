<p>Editor&rsquo;s Note: This video clip is from a lecture by Lawrence Lebowitz, Vice President for Marketing, of the law firm of <a href="https://www.cohenlaw.com/">Cohen &amp; Grigsby.</a> He is trying to recruit business for his firm, which specializes in getting <a href="https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/perm.cfm">Permanent Labor Certification</a> (PERM) for foreign workers. He explains how to stay within the limits of the law but avoid hiring Americans.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:llebowitz@cohenlaw.com">You can e-mail Mr. Lebowitz.</a></p>
<p>The PERM he is talking about is defined by the US Department of Labor as follows:<blockquote>permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States &hellip; The DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are no qualified U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job at the prevailing wage for that occupation in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.<br>

			<p>The most common trick is to &#8220;advertise&#8221; available domestic positions as little and as discretely as one can, in order to minimize the apparent American demand for these jobs.  That&rsquo;s the pretense used to outsource to Bangalore.</p>

			<p>Of course this hypocrite expects that he should be able to make a living in the United States; just that the rest of us should be prevented from doing so.  I have 79 US and foreign patents awarded, and now work out of my garage as a welder and car mechanic.  I&rsquo;d like a nice chemistry job again; it&rsquo;d be really great to put in eight hour days in a lab instead of 12 in an unheated garage (it has been quite cold lately) and not finish work quite as sore, tired and filthy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love to know this man&rsquo;s home address.</p>

This is nothing new, but infuriates me nevertheless. Employment will become even less of an option in the future for many white US citizens. This will apply to both private and public sector jobs.</p>
<p>Learn a viable skilled trade for self- employment,develop business skills and own your own business and learn all you can about stock and real estate investing. We will need to become entrepreneurs! This will be the only way to maintain a certain degree of independence and autonomy.</p>

This video has been circulating for a few years now and I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone mention it other than on websites like this.</p>
<p>Has this firm, these people, this group, ever been questioned or investigated for their practices?</p>
<p>They appear to be following the letter of the law but not the spirit. </p>
<p>Another practice used to exclude American workers was one I came across while working at a university in the late &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>The computer science department ran a job fair and invited all the name firms. Not one large firm such as Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and others sent representatives.</p>

			<p>What a pack of worthless Red bloodsucking parasites, this Comrade Lebowitz and friends are!</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;And our goal is clearly, not to find a qualified and interested US worker. And you know, that in a sense sounds funny, ahhhh&hellip;but it&rsquo;s what we are trying to do here&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really &#8220;funny&#8221; Comrade Lebowitz, and that goes for your little Red playmates as well. However, would it not be even more funny to drag the whole damned pack of you to the Mexican border; strip you of everything you have (maybe even your: hands, feet, and tongues;) and then toss you over that border? What a tsunami of laughs and barrel of monkeys that would be.</p>
<p>Enough said about these Sub-traitors! <br>

			<p>That video has been making the rounds on Youtube for quite some time.  I suspect that by now the complete list of Americans who have <i>not</i> seen it is:</p>
<p>1.  Those with no internet access.</p>
<p>2.  435 United States Representatives.</p>
<p>3.  100 United States Senators.</p>
<p>4.  The current and previous Presidents of the United States.</p>
<p>After all, (2)-(4) pretty much sums up all the people foolish enough to believe that American businessmen want H1-b workers because they can&rsquo;t find Americans to do the job, rather than because they want cheap labor.<br>

			<p>As disgraceful as these traitors are, they are no more so than IBM announcing last Thursday that it will layoff 5000 more US workers and ship the jobs overseas to India, China or down south to Brazil. Make no mistake, we are becoming a Third-World country&hellip;and fast.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I&rsquo;ve never understood why the word &#8220;Protectionism&#8221; is seen as such a bad word by so many here in the United States. Have we been brainwashed? I mean, isn&rsquo;t that what we here at AmRen are trying to do? Protect our heritage, protect our culture, protect our race and protect our country? Free trade is a politically-correct term for &#8220;slavery&#8221; and a means to lay waste to the foundations and underpinnings of this country, stealing the wealth of the people that worked so hard to build it while benefiting only the minions of the New World Order.</p>

			<p>A relative in Saint Paul worked with a woman whose husband &#8220;works&#8221; in this &#8220;field.&#8221; They live in a high rise downtown and I bet their condo would run about a million, doorman, etc.</p>
<p>One day the wife was telling the &#8220;office girls&#8221; about their trip to New York after they were married, where they visited S&M; clubs, I believe it was in some sort of visitors section to watch people beat the c**p out of each other. The silly little white woman exclaimed, &#8220;I cannot believe these are our friends. This is what they like to do for entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some high culture our &#8220;elites&#8221; have! It is said that entertainment or art can lift a community and the people up, and the presence of too many low amusements can pull the people down. I think that what you are naturally drawn to in your free time says everything there is to say about you. I just wonder how these &#8220;people&#8221; look at us in everyday life, like we are some rubes I suppose. Unenlightened cattle who are not worth the bother to even fasten to some plow.</p>

			<p>OUTSOURCING   &mdash;   jobs sent beyond our borders&hellip; and INSOURCING   &mdash;   hiring H1b visa holders, even illegal immigrants&hellip; are the two worst pieces of treachery ever foistered on the American Middle Class!</p>
<p>What America truly needs? A MIMUM 25-YEAR MORATORIUM ON ALL IMMIGRATION! By &#8220;ALL&#8221;, I do mean exactly that! Forget the drivel about separating families&hellip; if the immigrants are unhappy, flights leave daily for their countries of origin! America is more than overpopulated. It&rsquo;s time to stop and stabilize our population AND our economy.</p>

			<p>Let me be blunt. Wheather intentional or unintentional the result is the same; it keeps white males from well paying jobs in IT. The majority of American born IT people are white males, so as a consequence it disciminates against white males. And what is only class of citizens routinely disciminated against? Until we pass laws to prevent white discimination in employment and education, the diversity crowd will continue on until the average white man will have no oppertunity above day laborer.</p>

			<p>Businesses will continue to outsource and not follow the &#8216;spirit&rsquo; of the law. They are after the bottom line.</p>
<p>And the bottom line is business is unprofitable in the US. You have to pay hidden taxes in the sense of hiring a lot of useless minorities and women who&rsquo;s only claim to fame is feminism.</p>
<p>Complaining and protectionism is pointless. Cleaning out the rot from the system is.</p>

			<p>This is the problem with capitalism.  It is only interested in profits, hence &#8220;capital&#8221; in &#8220;capitalism.  I&rsquo;m hardly in favor of communism either, but capitalism has no interests in things like our labor force, management, worker/management relations (i.e. unions), high quality products and services, and just about everything that constitutes a healthy economy.  Under capitalism, it&rsquo;s considered good business to ship thousands of jobs overseas, putting white people out in the streets and selling shoddy, third world products to the white people who still have jobs.</p>

<p>I saw this in the mid eighties when I finished up my Cobol programming certificate at a community college.  Many firms came to the job fair.  But all they did was talk about opportunities in the computer field.  But surprise, surprise, not one of the firms had actual jobs available for American graduates.</p>

<p>You mean no opportunity at all.  Most employers would rather die than hire a White American as a day laborer, maid, restaurant worker etc.  I just saw Jennifer Lopez&rsquo;s movie &#8220;Maid in Manhattan&#8221; on tv.  She&rsquo;s a hotel maid.  I had to laugh, no hotel would hire an American of hispanic descent who actually grew up in America and spoke Emglish as a maid.</p>
<p>They would set up another company and hire that company as a contract service employing only non English speaking illegals.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;hiring H-1b visa holders, even illegal immigrants&hellip; are the two worst pieces of treachery ever foistered on the American Middle Class!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Fed-Up:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also add these tactics that are being used to de-power (and destroy) Whites:  flooding this country with cheap-labor, non-White refugees in order to make Whites a minority, passing specious AA and hate crimes laws that are specifically directed at stifling and punishing any criticism Whites may have of the  NWO, open discrimination against Whites in employment, college placements and promotions (forcing Whites to take lower salaries), imposing satanic taxes on the productive (mostly) White middle and upper-middle class to strip them of their earnings, AND AND AND  &mdash;  creating hyper-inflation in order to further rob Whites of any wealth they might have left. (Look for the hyper-inflation to start later this year).</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;learn all you can about stock and real estate investing. We will need to become entrepreneurs! This will be the only way to maintain a certain degree of independence and autonomy&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but I think this window may be closing as well.  The communist government is making it as difficult as possible to open and maintain businesses, the Chinese are rumbling about dumping the US monopoly-money dollar as the reserve currency (look at it from their point of view, who can blame them?).</p>
<p>Is it any wonder there is a rush to buy gold and other non-dollar commodities?  Has anyone seen those constant, annoying TV commercials inviting people to &#8216;send in their old gold jewelry&rsquo; (yeah, where they&rsquo;ll pay you a tenth of what the gold is worth)?</p>
<p>In Communist California, I&rsquo;m wondering when the state government will start confiscating and re-distributing our land.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Free trade&#8221; is a lie.  What we have is &#8220;managed trade&#8221;.  trade is managed for the benefit of the multinational corporation.  I would like to see a tit-for-tat trading system in place with tariffs (the way it used to be).  Only then will we have truly &#8220;free trade&#8221;.  The Japanese government requires that any automotive imports be inspected individually.  Compare that with our government which issues a &#8220;blanket certification&#8221; once safety and emission tests are certified.  If our government was smart, we would place tha SAME restrictions on Japanese imports as they do on ours.  This would level the &#8220;playing field&#8221; in a hurry.  When the Japanese cars are lined up at the docks awaiting their &#8220;individual inspection&#8221;, Japan would get the message.</p>

			<p><i>This is the problem with capitalism.</i></p>
<p>The problem with capitalism is when it becomes a way of life, rather than a tool.  Tools are great only insofar as they do what you want them to do.  When you worship your tools, you have a serious problem.</p>
<p>Capitalism is NOT THE POINT, it&rsquo;s a way of getting certain things done.  But when everything else is stripped away, and all that&rsquo;s left is Capitalism, disaster looms.</p>

<p>When the tech jobs disappeared, they were still here.  </p>
<p>Citizenship was all they wanted; their tech credentials were just to get a foot in the door until their citizenship papers.</p>
