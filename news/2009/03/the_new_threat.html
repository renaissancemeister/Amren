<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0330/p09s02-coop.html">The New Threat to Freedom of Expression</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paula Schriefer, Christian Science Monitor, March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} On Friday, the UN Human Rights Council approved a resolution that calls on states to limit criticism of religions  &mdash;  specifically Islam. This is the tenth time such a resolution has passed at the UN&rsquo;s primary human rights body. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, began introducing similar resolutions in 1999 arguing that Islam  &mdash;  the only religion specifically cited in the text  &mdash;  must be shielded from unfair associations with terrorism and human rights abuses.</p>
<p>These so-called &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; resolutions also have a perfect record at the UN General Assembly, where the latest version passed in December. The resolutions contain some very appealing language, steeped in standard human rights values such as dialogue, harmony, and tolerance  &mdash;  all good things.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t be fooled; the resolutions only give clever lip service to these values. In reality they are calling for laws and actions that prohibit dialogue by declaring certain topics off limits for discussion, leading to intolerance of any view that some Muslims may find offensive. For instance, criticizing the practice of polygamy or the greater weight given to the testimony of men over women in sharia law would be forbidden. Such laws that prohibit blasphemy, defamation, or the defiling of Islam already exist in many of the countries that support the defamation of religions resolutions.</p>
<p>Who decides what views defame religion? Governments, of course. And the governments of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) have some of the worst records of respecting freedom of expression and belief in the world. Some of Freedom Houses&rsquo;s lowest-ranking countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Iran, are frequent sponsors. {snip}</p>
<p>Of course, the very idea that you can defame a religion at all flies in the face of both fundamental rights of expression and belief. A religion, like all ideas and beliefs, must be open to debate, discussion, and even criticism. For this reason, religions themselves do not have rights. Rights belong exclusively to people.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these resolutions present a win-win scenario for OIC countries. They serve to legitimize the repression of minority voices at home, while scoring points with religious leaders and Islamic fundamentalists by fueling views of an antagonistic and &#8220;Islamophobic&#8221; Western world. Extremists are thus tacitly encouraged to take action against any who dare to defame their religious sensibilities.</p>
<p>Salmon Rushdie, Flemming Rose, and Theo Van Gogh are just some of the better known individuals who have been attacked  &mdash;  and, in the case of Mr. Van Gogh, killed  &mdash;  for expressing views deemed defamatory. Thousands of lesser-known human rights activists, bloggers, academics, and journalists have been threatened, imprisoned, beaten, or killed for expressing their beliefs. Countless Muslims have been persecuted for voicing a brand of faith deemed unorthodox and therefore blasphemous or defamatory. It is impossible to know how many have not dared to raise their voices out of fear of retribution.</p>
<p>Moreover, the OIC is not satisfied with the legitimacy it gains from the passage of nonbinding UN resolutions. Supporters of the &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; concept have insidiously begun using language from existing international human rights law, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to pervert international human rights norms.</p>

		<p>Most regular Americans can&rsquo;t understand the complicated economic, monetary policies that are behind American economic decline - but they can understand what is going on  when the UN - Third World Islamic countries pass anti Western speech laws that make it an international crime to say anything bad about any Muslims or Islam anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This is a winning issue for us - go out and let people know what is going down and that we are organizing resistance.</p>
<p>Here is one of THE best videos that explains in a short, clear way how Muslim groups have hi-jacked PC hate speech laws to persecute our people for daing to speak out against Islamic terrorism, mass Muslim immigration, colonization, slavery, female cicumsision, grooming of poor British girls for prostitution, honor killing and for pointing out the real, violent hate speech of ugly Muslims in Western countries who wear masks and hold signs threatening to mass murder our people in our countries. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the great video:<br>

		<p>Why should religion be immune from critical scrutiny? What the UN Human Rights Council is really trying to do here is outlaw honesty when it comes to discussing these stone age superstitions and the fools who beleive them. <br>
Both religion and science attempt to provide answers but only science attempts to do so honestly. It&rsquo;s time to give religion the importance it deserves, that it is just a remnant of earlier stages of human culture where it should be left for discussion in a cultural anthropology class.</p>

		<p>Why is the UN passing a law protecting Muslims&hellip; while in Hollywood and at NY publishing companies it&rsquo;s open season on Christians; and Jesus, the twelve disciples and the 10 commandments have been completely banned in public schools and even at the sanitation department?</p>
<p>Could it be because the Muslim religion is growing while the Christian religion declines? Is that why the UN seems only concerned with helping Muslims?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s related, but we have the same thing going on between whites and people of color. Leftists and people of color are doing everything in their power to advance the cause non-whites. They celebrate every advance and highlight every  perceived instance of racism. Conservative leaders say things aren&rsquo;t so bad and we&rsquo;re doing what we can. Those are the only two viewpoints we hear. And the only ones acceptable. Meanwhile the entire time the whole thing is designed to be as racist as absolutely possible to whites. Both in deed, and then in ignoring the racism. Well, I guess being racist against whites is the goal. </p>

		<p>&#8220;UN Human Rights Council once again passes resolution to halt criticism of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just because a non-white group has a HUGE contingent of people who want to kill as many non-believers as they can doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to be rude to them.</p>
<p>Thank allah for the brilliance of the UN. </p>

<p>This paragraph says it all  &mdash;    &mdash;  NOT ONCE have Muslims ever spoken out for anyone other than THEMSELVES.  Christians and Jews are always speaking out in support of other religions, BUT MUSLIMS NEVER DO THE SAME.  They are racist, sexist, homophobic, narcissistic wackos.</p>

<p>Thank you, Robert!  That was an excellent post. You will rile not only fanatical Islamists but many others too, I&rsquo;m afraid.  Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s something that needed to be said.  The truth, like iodine, often stings.  Those it hurts most will yell the loudest. </p>
<p>I am all for the rights and freedoms of religions and their believers, by the way. (I do not advocate &#8220;open season&#8221; on religion, as someone above mentions.  The reality that currently prevails in Islamic countries is &#8220;open season&#8221; against <i>non</i>-believers.)  But religions should not be allowed to prevent others from exercising their rights as well to have and express an opinion. Freedom of religion, or freedom FROM religion   &mdash;   either way, only freedom of speech will guarantee that.   </p>
<p>Outlawing criticism of religion would be a move back towards the stone age. It would be as bad as enforcing religion.</p>

<p>Excellent sentiment, Robert.  I am with you all the way.  I have suggested that only ancestory worship has a valid place in our spiritual life because we may idealize our &#8220;grandfathers&#8221; and that can be a springboard for cultural and racial preservation since it instills personal pride in one&rsquo;s indentity.  This works well with the goals of preserving any race and culture as well.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree? </p>

<p>Back to the stone age is exactly where the muslims want the world to be. If you have not been in the muslim world, you can have no real conception of what it would be like if the muslims, especially the stupid black muslim converts here in America, get control of the government. Picture Afghanistan, but bigger.</p>

<p>I like that. <br>
I&rsquo;m not advocating it, but it&rsquo;s better than what we have now&hellip; (worshipping a bunch of imaginary sprits that fly around in the sky).  At least your ancestors were something real, not imaginary; and they have left solid genetic evidence behind: i.e. you!</p>
