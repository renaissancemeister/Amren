<h1>Report Sees &#8216;Sobering Statistics&rsquo; on Racial Inequality</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Social and economic gaps between whites and blacks persist in the United States despite an atmosphere that led to the election of President Obama, an Urban League report said.</p>
<p>Blacks remain twice as likely to be unemployed, three times more likely to live in poverty and more than six times as likely to be imprisoned compared with whites, according to the group&rsquo;s annual State of Black America report issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As the Obama administration ushers in a new era of hope, change, and to some extent, unity for this nation, many are asking whether racial barriers have now been erased in America,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Are discrimination, division and inequality antiquated relics of the past? For a quick answer to that question, one has but to review some of the sobering statistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Urban League&rsquo;s equality index shows the status of blacks at 71 percent that of whites. It said that economics &#8220;remains the area with the greatest degree of inequality,&#8221; with social justice, health and education following.</p>
<p>&#8220;The analysis shows that while important gains were made, both for blacks and whites, in each of these areas during the 1990s expansion, there was actually a loss of ground in median household income, poverty and home ownership during the 2001-2007 expansion, known as the jobless recovery,&#8221; the report&rsquo;s executive summary said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One, from Gwendolyn Grant of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, warns that the &#8220;historic&#8221; election of Obama, the nation&rsquo;s first black president, &#8220;may cause us to fall prey to a false sense of accomplishment and self-satisfaction, and that apathy and complacency may set in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must use this moment to reinvigorate the movement and re-engage the nation in a struggle to finish the job of equality, liberty and justice for all. So as we move past this historic moment, let us not repeat the history of our greatest popular movements and allow injustice to prevail, simply because a black family lives in the White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grant proposes that a movement to foster equality for blacks in all realms of American life should be &#8220;fashioned&#8221; after ideas promulgated by the Obama campaign. Those ideas include blending personal responsibility and &#8220;principled ideas&#8221; with pragmatism, and building grass-roots movements crossing racial, ethnic, generational, gender and regional lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report lists policy recommendations in the areas of home ownership, jobs, health and education. Here is a sampling:</p>
<p># Increasing funding for underskilled workers&rsquo; job training programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p># Funding infrastructure development for public building construction and renovations of schools, community centers, libraries, recreation centers and parks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p># Passing a home buyers&rsquo; bill of rights that would protect and educate consumers and provide home-buying help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p># Developing &#8220;a comprehensive health infrastructure for the delivery of health education, prevention and intervention initiatives&#8221; for blacks.</p>
<p># Studying health care in the criminal justice system as it relates to black inmates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

								<h2>The Stimulus Package: Winners Large and Small</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Charles Dervarics, Diverse, March 5, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>As the dust clears on the newly enacted economic stimulus package, it&rsquo;s clear there are some big winners, some smaller winners and only a few left out in the cold under the compromise legislation totaling $789 billion.</p>
<p>The package has more than $100 billion for education, including $15 billion to bolster the Pell Grant program through a $500 increase in the maximum grant for needy students. Almost as significant for many students is a two-year American Opportunity Tax Credit, which will provide many low- and middle-income families with a $2,500 annual credit to offset college costs. This credit will be more generous than the current $1,500 credit available through the HOPE Scholarship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partial refundability is great. That&rsquo;s new for higher education,&#8221; says Angela Peoples, legislative director of the United States Student Association, which has advocated the approach since the start of the debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pipeline programs: Core initiatives for low-income children such as Title I and Head Start will get significant boosts, a move that may help millions of future college students. Title I will receive $13 billion in new funding with an eye toward reducing achievement gaps, and special education will get an additional $12 billion. Head Start will get $2 billion, half of which is going to its infant/toddler component, Early Head Start. {snip}</p>
<p>States and school districts: {snip} Of the $56 billion, $5 billion is available only as bonuses for school districts that meet high-performance targets.</p>
<p>Job training programs: {snip} The bill has $3.95 billion in additional funding for adult and youth programs, including $1.2 billion to create an estimated 1 million summer jobs for youth.</p>
<p>Science: The final package includes $8.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $3 billion for research activities at the National Science Foundation. {snip}</p>
<p>Education technology: Some college students may find it easier to buy computers, since the bill will allow owners of the popular 529 Education Plans to spend proceeds on the costs of computer technology. Students and parents already can put these funds toward tuition, fees, books as well as room and board. At the K-12 level, the stimulus bill includes $650 million for computer and science labs as well as related teacher training.</p>
<p>Among other things, the package earmarks $200 million to bolster funding for the college work-study program. And, states are eligible for $250 million in competitive grants to design data systems that improve the analysis of student achievement.<br/>

			<p>Can not the Urban League, the NAACP and other groups think of one proposal related to black America that doesn&rsquo;t involve government spending?  Jim Clyburn doesn&rsquo;t seem to want us to link these two things, he must not talk to the Urban League very much.</p>

			<p>Somehow if white Americans work really really hard and pay more and more taxes to a government who no longer represents their own interests, Blacks will become &#8220;equal&#8221;. <br/>
   The implications of this article is somehow the white population is the root cause of more blacks going to prison, not graduating from school, and having teenage pregnancies. Somehow<br/>
white&rsquo;s are responsible for footing the bill to allow blacks to<br/>
live in the same style the white Americans work so hard to maintain for themselves.</p>

			<p> Sounds like a pitch for continued affirmative action, qoutas, set asides and the other programs of preferential treatment. A lot of people are starting to question the need for all the aforementioned items and they want to get thier point out there first.<br/>
 I wonder when the white race will wake up and tire of the blacks constantly wallowing in self pity and demanding handouts. At some point,even the most liberal white person will have to acknowledge that the more you give, the more they want.</p>

			<p>Africans as a group will never succeed in a modern technological society because of their low mean IQ.  There is no known way to change that, because IQ is largely genetically determined.  Hence, no amount of Head Start, mignight basket ball, Ebonics, or Affirmative Action will make a lasting (generational) impact.  This is why there is not a single successful large African community or Nation anywhere on Earth.  </p>
<p>Of course, by spending Billions or Trillions of Dollars, we can help the current generation of Africans so that they read a little better and have more skills.  But the problem is that we will have to do this again and again, every generation.  Besides what&rsquo;s the point of spending Billions of Dollars to get the average African to read at a 10th grade level, when for 1/100 of the cost spent on gifted children of all races, we could produce thousands of scientists who could actually solve many of our current problems.  </p>
<p>Yes, there are some high-IQ Africans, and many Africans are hard-working, law-abiding, and motivated.  Individuals of all races who have such qualities should be encouraged to achieve their potential.  High IQ African children should be supported in gifted programs.  However, fertilizing weeds will not produce a bountiful corn crop.  </p>

			<p>I think we need a State of White America, too.  Any takers?  Whites are twice as likely as blacks to be accused of racism.  Whites are far more likely to be called racists if they marched and agitated for the same rights and privileges that black groups do.  Whites are dwindling in numbers.  Those would be my stats I&rsquo;d throw out</p>

			<p>Conspicuously absent are the reasons behind high black unemployment, high black incarceration rates, high poverty rates. We all know it has nothing to do with skin color, as it has everything to do with socially and economically aberrant and irresponsible behaviors. Your chances of being unemployed are tied to your marketable skills, not your skin color. You drop out of school, your chances of finding employment in a technologically changing world diminish considerably. You go to jail because you run afoul of the law. Nothing esoteric there. You drop out of school AND go to jail, your likelihood of making a buck is practically nil, especially there are millions of &#8220;guest workers&#8221; willing to do the only work you are capable of. </p>

			<p>In order for there to be this constant lamantation about racial &#8220;inequality&#8221; one has to assume that racial &#8220;equality&#8221;  can, will, or ever has ever existed in the first place - and it cannot, will not, and never has! Thus, these &#8220;gaps&#8221; are self-fulfilling prophecies every time. No amount of &#8220;funding&#8221; is going to bring little LaShawn or Shaniqua&rsquo;s IQ up - not in our or their lifetimes anyway!   </p>
<p>It is curious though - the more they continue pointing out this persistant &#8220;inequality&#8221; even in a time when a Black(or Mulatto at least)sits in the White House, and &#8220;racism&#8221; is more an abstract concept than reality to most, and many suburban Blacks are tooling around town in fancy cars, wearing expensive cloths and the like; it seems inevitable that Whites will completely lose patience with this &#8220;inequality&#8221; flim-flam once and for all. I believe fewer and fewer people are buying into this idea that Black failure is all about White wickedness and &#8220;racism.&#8221; I hear grumbling to this effect more and more these days. </p>

			<p>Many liberals are confused about the capabilities and intelligence of blacks because they incorrectly link the achievements of mullatos, octoroons, and other black hybrids of varying percentages as being representative of all blacks. Clearly they are not.  I don&rsquo;t have any statistics on front of me at this time, but I would bet that the average intelligence of mullatos is considerably higher than that of full strength blacks (think Barack Obama, Condolesa Rice, Colin Powell, or Eric Holder).  What is most amazing to me in light of this information is that in many instances it is these very same mullatos who are the great champions of the black cause.  Even when these mullatoes have achieved great success in life through hard work, discipline, and affirmative action (in many cases), they suffer the cause of actual blacks who have not done likewise.  Blacks who are impoverished because they dropped out of school, or who are incarcerated because they sold drugs, robbed a liquor store, or murdered somebody.  These are some of the blacks for which the hearts of so many mullatos bleed.  The forces of group identity among blacks and all of the mixes of blacks is truly mind boggling.</p>

			<p>I am in total agreement with Anonymous 7:13 pm on March 25.  The solution to poverty is selective breeding and to educate on a realistic level meaning education should match the ability and apptitude of the student.  What the present president wants is basically a re-run of the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; programs conceived and pushed by L. Johnson but even more on an insane monentary level. Head Start and other fantasies has been around for over 40 years with no substantial benefits to the blacks and society as this article shows.  The blacks in general are educational and economical no better than before all these greatly wastefuly programs were created.  How different society would be if all that money were put to better use instead of catering this country&rsquo;s educational system to inferior genes.  Why is this country so obsessed with closing the racial gap in education and economics to the point of destroying itself?  Now we have a black man as president who has no concept about money and debt.  He will put the finishing touches to the downward spiral of this country.  This country currently is in a free fall from all the subprime mess which originated from the fantasy of making loans to people who have no concept about money.  To save of what is left of this country, the system of electing leaders/public servants needs to be revised.  Not a revolution but revised so common people with intelligence and integrity can run for office.  Special interest money should be forbidden.  </p>

Racial inequalities will always exist for two reasons:</p>
<p>- Races are &#8216;diverse&rsquo; (different) and there will aways be differences in outcomes in every area.</p>
<p>- There&rsquo;s a great deal of money and political power that comes with inflaming and maintaining racial inequalities. We all know the people who make their living off this stuff.</p>

			<p>No doubt, the figures cited in the article are deceptive, because statistical information on race in this country is completely ridiculous. Blacks in America are much farther behind &#8216;Whites&rsquo; when the categories are defined in more accurate terms. For instance, the statistics probably include all sorts of &#8216;Blacks&rsquo; who have significant quanities of White genetic material; this elevates the status profile of the whole group, even though it is a flawed reflection of reality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the so-called &#8216;White&rsquo; category itself is absurd and completely out of step with reality. If it is restricted to its original range of inclusion   &mdash;   meaning Northwest European/Germanic types   &mdash;   then certainly the status profile would be dramatically different. Europeans are NOT a homogenous block, no matter how much the posters on Amren want them to be. Northwest Europeans aren&rsquo;t the same as other Europeans, and there is plenty of variation even within certain European groupings. </p>
<p>If you people stand for &#8216;race realism&rsquo;, then get in touch with reality! Europe is not a uniform racial entity. Homogenizing &#8216;European man&rsquo; is just as undesirable as homogenizing the entire species.</p>

			<p># Increasing funding for underskilled workers&rsquo; job training programs.</p>
<p>Why bother. The maximum skills they can acquire can also be acquired by illegal aliens on the job at lower cost to employers.</p>
<p># Funding infrastructure development for public building construction and renovations of schools, community centers, libraries, recreation centers and parks.</p>
<p>Within two months of completing a $120 million dollar high school for El Cerrito (mainly for the benefit of black and hispanic kids in Richmond) the school has been vandalized multiple times. So the point of renovating public buildings in the ghetto is what? I suppose so a minority owned business can get the contract to clean the graffiti and fix the broken windows.</p>
<p># Passing a home buyers&rsquo; bill of rights that would protect and educate consumers and provide home-buying help.</p>
<p>The help black homebuyers need is someone at the bank to tell them no if they can&rsquo;t handle the debt responsibly and honorably.</p>
<p># Developing &ldquo;a comprehensive health infrastructure for the delivery of health education, prevention and intervention initiatives&rdquo; for blacks.</p>
<p>Just pass and enforce a law making it a crime for blacks to eat trans-saturated fats and corn syrup.</p>
<p># Studying health care in the criminal justice system as it relates to black inmates.</p>
<p>Blacks get AIDS is prison because they rape gay inmates and junkies.</p>

			<p>This is an utterly stunning report.  I, and many others I&rsquo;m sure, expected that after sixty days in office The Messiah would have successfully raised black Africans, after centuries of incapacity, sloth, criminality, and low achievement (all the work of evil whites and the cunning and duplicitous Asians)  to the highest levels of invention, creativity, productivity, and civil society.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure that given another sixty days our Dear Leader will succeed.</p>

			<p>To John regarding your posting: john at 9:54 AM on March 26 </p>
<p>I thought Obama was &#8216;The Great Leader&rsquo;?  I thing the next mulatto after Obama (maybe David Patterson or Eric Holder) will hold the title of &#8216;The Dear Leader&rsquo;.  That&rsquo;s how they did it in North Korea.  While I&rsquo;m on the subject, I&rsquo;m pretty sure our next president will also be dark.  The republicans seem to want to &#8216;one-up&rsquo; the democrats with a dark man of their own like Bobby Jindal or Michael Steele as two such examples.  According to the rules of political correctness and racial elitism, America needs to prove further still that it is not racist by electing a succession of black or minority presidents.

<p>&#8220;&hellip;six times more likely to be imprisoned&hellip;&#8221; That probably had something to do with committing a crime - right?</p>
