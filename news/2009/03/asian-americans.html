<h1>Asian-Americans Urge Obama to Reform Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asian-American members of the US Congress on Tuesday urged President Barack Obama to reform immigration by year end, saying the current system was tearing families in their community apart.</p>
<p>Mike Honda, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, wrote Obama a letter saying that immigration reform &#8220;must remain an early priority in your administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration raids tear families apart, dreams of undocumented students are suspended indefinitely and growing immigration backlogs keep close family members separated for years, sometimes decades,&#8221; Honda wrote.</p>
<p>Honda, a member of Obama&rsquo;s Democratic Party, said some two million Asians hoping to be reunited with families were languishing in the immigration service&rsquo;s backlog, account for half of such cases.</p>
<p>He said Asian-Americans  &mdash;  who account for some five percent of the US population  &mdash;  were also concerned about the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s past treatment of detainees and lack of due process.</p>
<p>During his campaign, Obama called for a more efficient immigration system, saying families were suffering from lengthy background checks for applicants, and said illegal residents should have a conditional path to citizenship.</p>
<p>Obama also criticized raids on immigration communities as ineffective, while pledging to security on US borders.</p>
<p>But Obama&rsquo;s predecessor George W. Bush twice tried and failed to pass sweeping immigration reform that would have given legal status and a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country.</p>
<p>Some members of Bush&rsquo;s Republican Party argued that immigrants were taking jobs at a time that the economy is in crisis.</p>
<p>Hispanic leaders have also appealed to Obama to act on immigration, urging him to call a moratorium on immigration raids and deportations.<br>

			<p>Look north to Canada.  Asians are gaining in numbers there (the largest ethnic migrant groups now number in the millions, more than aboriginals, Hispanics or blacks).  They are becoming correspondingly pushy. </p>
<p>Just before the summer Olympics, Chinese migrants demonstrated on Parliament Hill, waving the flag of the PRC and proclaiming their nationalist slogan: &#8220;one China, one family&#8221;. </p>
<p>They see encroachment into the West as an entitlement rather than a guest privilege.  </p>

			<p>As if many of the Asians here legally are so good for us?  H-1B Visas, anyone?</p>
<p>Remember, there are 1.3 billion Chinese and hundreds of millions more Oriental Asians and Pacific Islanders.  If anything, the numbers are a good argument against migration.</p>

			<p>Hmmm&hellip;.????</p>
<p>&#8220;Honda, a member of Obama&rsquo;s Democratic Party, said some two million Asians hoping to be reunited with families were languishing in the immigration service&rsquo;s backlog, account for half of such cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, let their families join with them back in their native lands. Why do we need them here? Or an even better question is, why should we want any of them here?</p>
<p>Clearly, these so-called &#8220;model minorities&#8221; are quick at learning how to best model what the worst of minorities are doing in the USA&rsquo;s &#8220;entitlement&#8221; department, and not what the majority would consider standard operating procedures. If they want &#8220;special treatment,&#8221; give it to them via a boat back to India or Vietnam, not as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to every 2nd or 200th cousin that they can find wallowing in the Ganges, or cavorting in some rice paddy. </p>
<p>Enough said, other than, God help us all!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve come across more and more Asian groups adopting the grievance cuture of Blacks and Hispanics. Being part Asian mysef, it disappoints me as one of the points of prides that many Asians have held for some time now is that they are better than that. There is no nobility or honor in whining or asking for handouts or to think you are above the law. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect that the American government would actually eforce their immigration laws and deport those that came here illegally.</p>

			<p>All this is a pre-cursor to all these groups eventually usurping European-Americans in our own country.  This is only the beginning. It gets a bit depressing hearing about all these other non-White groups fighting for their so-called &#8220;rights&#8221; while White people sit and do nothing.  But there will be point of critical mass reached. I think everyone on this board is ready for it.</p>

			<p>A TOTAL MORATORIUM ON ALL IMMIGRATION should be Obama&rsquo;s priority! We have too many immigrants here now. Stealing jobs that rightfully should go to American citizens. Why in hell do we need any more immigrants&hellip; when there clearly are not enough jobs to go around for the population we currently have. If families are &#8220;torn apart&#8221;, the answer is crystal clear. Let the Asians return to their former homeland&hellip; WHERE THEY BELONG!</p>

			<p>Post-1965 LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians and their &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline are waging a racial war of agression against the majority Native White American population. No one should have any doubt about this. The invasion should have been stopped before the asian beach head was established.</p>

			<p>Well, America has become nothing but a racial-spoils system so every ethnic group wants to bolster their numbers in order to achieve more power and money. The Asians aren&rsquo;t any different and of course their definition of &#8220;reform&#8221; is the same has hispanics, which means they want immigration laws. They just don&rsquo;t want them enforced on their particular racial group.</p>

			<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before- - there is no reason to &#8220;tear families apart.&#8221; If a family member gets deported, have them take their families with them. If somebody is here and are having problems getting the rest of their family here,they&rsquo;re free to go back home to their family. Nobody is holding a gun to their head making them stay. I fail to see this as a complicated problem</p>

			<p> Why don&rsquo;t we just let everyone come here now ? Now Asians<br>
are whining immigration raids tear families apart. Gee, I<br>
wonder where they learned that cry from. It&rsquo;s time to seal<br>
the borders and cut all immigration now. We can hardly<br>
afford it with our economic crisis. And the Balkinization<br>
factor that it brings .</p>

<p>Yes, and they also have other family in their native countries, the ones they&rsquo;re living in now. Then once <i>they&rsquo;re</i> here, they&rsquo;ll complain about the family they <i>had</i> to part with overseas, and &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t we bring them here? Why won&rsquo;t you let us be reunited?&#8221; And thus the chain is neverending. Lots of Americans are parted from their families. Plenty of Americans have children, parents or siblings who are 1,000 or 2,000 miles away. That&rsquo;s why we invented telephones, email, and airplanes. They fly as easily to Shanghai as to Sarasota.</p>
<p>Family reunification? Husband, wife, minor children, period. Not even that if the marriage was arranged.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s funny that if we, as whites, demand less immigration then it as automatically assumed to be for racist reasons. But for Mike Honda and others to push a policy that deliberately brings in more people just like them is perfectly OK - no racist motives at all.</p>
<p>FTS (if you know what I mean). I don&rsquo;t care if i&rsquo;m called a racist, I&rsquo;m going to fight for my interests as vigourously as they fight for theirs.</p>

			<p>Anyone who believes Asians are a &#8220;model minority&#8221; needs a reality check. They are racist hypocrites. They freak out if a white &#8220;gaijin&#8221; moves into their town, but they have no qualms about dumping their low-class immigrants onto white countries. Don&rsquo;t believe for a second that Japan, China, and South Korea will return the favor if, for example, you guys decide to move to Asia because white countries have become mongrelized.</p>
<p>Like other non-whites, Asians have no business in white countries. Allowing them in is a mistake&hellip; and by the way, it&rsquo;s not too difficult to be the &#8220;model minority&#8221; when blacks, mestizos, and Muslims are your competition.</p>

			<p>if orientals (when did it become &#8216;offensive&rsquo; to say that? Who decided), our alleged model minority, are adapting indentity politics and rather than pursue policies for the good of society, but rather, pursue policies that help their race(s) then how can anyone expect whites to NOT do the same. That is the only shoe that hasn&rsquo;t dropped in this great multicultural &#8216;experiment&rsquo; as liberals love to call it.</p>
<p>I read in  vdare articles that a. oriental intermarriage is falling as they gain in population and become an ethnic block<br>
b. they are shifting to vote lopsidedly democratic as an ethnic block looking for handouts/special privledges/regonition.</p>
<p>Even Indians, a high achieving immigrant group - are adapting the hate whitey, you owe us something model</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing that &#8220;we&#8221; are tearing families apart. All of a sudden we&rsquo;re the whipping boy for everything that goes wrong in this world. WE are not tearing families apart. Can&rsquo;t these people see that when they break into our county, it is they who are disrupting their families? They must know there is a chance of getting caught and being deported. Do they really think that it is wrong to enforce our laws. Oh, wait! The most vocal opponent to laws being enforced seems to be one of us. Not really. Queen Nancy works for a foreign government and thinks her subjects are unpatriotic. She needs to be run out of town.</p>

			<p>If there was anything even close to a reciprocal immigration policy with a lot of these Asian countries, there would be a fraction of the current amount of Asians in the country. They certainly know who they want, or perhaps more importantly don&rsquo;t want, in their countries.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know about China (how many people want to move there, anyway?) but Japan, South Korea, and India all have extremely &#8220;racist&#8221; immigration policies. But you know what? It&rsquo;s their right, and I don&rsquo;t blame them. I just wish they&rsquo;d stop being hypocrites.</p>
<p>These families never had to b &#8220;torn apart.&#8221; These people chose to move to this country. If they now complain about the unbearable separation there is more than one way to fix that.</p>

			<p>Remove your military from Asia. Pack up your bases and leave. China can handle Korea. Other than that the wars are over. Go home. If you don&rsquo;t want Asians in your home, then a good first gesture would be to get out of theirs.</p>

			<p>I agree with &#8220;A Suggestion&#8221;, in a way. However, the Asians here don&rsquo;t want to go home, and most of the Asians in Asia want to live in White countries. They don&rsquo;t want to be in their &#8220;own&#8221; home. Asian countries are just not as nice as Western nations, to put it mildly. Period. I&rsquo;ve traveled all over Asia, and Japan has a stifling atmosphere, never mind how crowded it seems to be everywhere. China, well, most of it is a dump. Korea. Heh. They&rsquo;re arrogant as heck yet the first thing you notice when you roll out of the airport is the stench. Then the crowding, rudeness and disorganization in surprising areas is something to behold. </p>

<p>You got that right, bro. You should nip (pardon the pun) invasions in the bud when there just starting. It&rsquo;s easier that way. Look what happened when we let Mexicans run wild. Throw a rock in the air and you&rsquo;re liable to hit a Mexican. Just remember this is a white people&rsquo;s country. Whoever builds a society with institutions own the land. Not some squatting indians.</p>
