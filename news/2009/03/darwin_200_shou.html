<h1>Should Scientists Study Race and IQ?</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<div class="text-center"><a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7231/full/457786a.html " target="No" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b><big>NO: Science and Society Do Not Benefit</big></b></a></div>
<p><i>Steven Rose, Nature, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Further, given that our society already accepts a number of restrictions to the pursuit of knowledge, it is sensible to require that funded research also addresses questions that either contribute to basic scientific understanding, offer new beneficial technological prospects, or aid sound public policy-making. These criteria are, of course, those used by both public and private funding bodies.</p>
<p>So what should we make of the century-old but regularly-recycled call for research aimed at discovering whether there are group differences in intelligence?</p>
<p>These days the &#8216;groups&rsquo; under consideration are &#8216;race&rsquo; and &#8216;gender&rsquo;. But it has not always been so. A hundred and fifty years ago, when Darwin published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, he regarded it as so self-evident that white Anglo-Saxon upper-class males were the most intelligent as not to need evidence. Half a century ago, at least in Britain, class was the more relevant grouping, leading to eugenic concerns that the genetically inferior workers were outbreeding their superiors. The issue of race and intelligence became prominent in the United States in the late 1960s, perhaps in response to the civil-rights movement. Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement? (A. R. Jensen Harvard Educ. Rev. 39, 1-123; 1969) argued that the deficit in black IQ was too great to be explained by deprivation and must be genetic. {snip}</p>
<p>The categories judged relevant to the study of group differences are clearly unstable, dependent on social, cultural and political context. No one, to my knowledge, is arguing for research on group differences in intelligence between north and south Welsh (although there are well-established average genetic differences between people living in the two regions). This calls into question the motivation behind looking for such specific group differences in intelligence, sheds doubt on whether such research is well-founded, and begs whether answers could possibly be put to good use. {snip}</p>
<p>There is a difficulty in the first instance of measuring &#8216;intelligence&rsquo;. For around a century, this has been done with the IQ test, originally developed in France as a way of supplementing teachers&rsquo; assessments of their pupils. In the hands of later psychometricians, the tests became increasingly reified, and seemingly made more scientific by the development of the term &#8216;g&rsquo; to encapsulate &#8216;crystallized&rsquo; or &#8216;general intelligence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>However, except to a small band of dedicated psychometricians, it seems obvious that to try to capture the many forms of socially expressed intelligent behaviour in a single coefficient  &mdash;  and to rank an entire population in a linear mode, like soldiers on parade lined up by height  &mdash;  excludes most richly intelligent human activities. Social intelligence, emotional intelligence, the intelligent hands of the craftsman or the intelligent intuition of the scientist all elude the &#8216;g&rsquo; straightjacket.</p>
<p><b>The flexibility of IQ</b></p>
<p>Group comparisons of IQ are even more problematic. Attempts have been made to make &#8216;culture-fair&rsquo; or &#8216;culture-free&rsquo; tests, as if such a thing were possible, to allow comparisons of &#8216;g&rsquo; between people from very different societies. But IQ is clearly a flexible construct  &mdash;  as amply demonstrated by decisions in the 1930s and 1940s in the United States and Britain to &#8216;adjust&rsquo; test questions to equalize the scores of boys and girls, because in previous versions of the tests girls had scored higher. {snip}</p>
<p>As for &#8216;race&rsquo;, the problem is whether it is a biologically, as opposed to socially, meaningful category. Among geneticists interested in differences in gene frequencies between populations, there is increasing consensus that the word obscures more than it reveals, and should be replaced by the concept of biogeographic ancestry, which makes possible the study of subpopulations for relevant genetic and phenotypic characteristics. There are some well-recognized, meaningful genetic differences between groups, for instance between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews in terms of their risk to Tay-Sachs disease, and the study of such differences may reveal important clues with respect, for instance, to disease propensity. But such groups are not normally considered socially distinct races for the purposes of studies of group differences in intelligence. Broad divisions between &#8216;white&rsquo; or &#8216;Caucasian&rsquo; and &#8216;black&rsquo; or &#8216;Asian&rsquo;, the groups generally discussed in the context of the IQ debate, especially in the United States, hide genetically important subpopulation differences within these groups. See box</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To conclude: the categories of intelligence, race and gender are not definable within the framework required for natural scientific research, failing my first criterion of being well-founded. They also fail the second criterion of being answerable: we lack the theoretical or technical tools to study them.</p>
<p>The standard approach of population biologists to estimating the potential genetic contribution to a trait is to make a heritability estimate. Whatever the strengths and weaknesses of this measure within a population, it is essentially just that: a within-population measure, only valid for a given environment. The nature of the equations means that if the environment changes, the heritability estimate changes too. Moreover, the measure relates to a randomly interbreeding population  &mdash;  useful for agricultural purposes such as estimating optimal genotypes for crop yields or milk production  &mdash;  but not for people. Even if reliable correlations were found between some intelligence test score and a measure of brain physiology or activity held by a specific group, such a correlation says nothing about the direction of causation.</p>
<p>As for the third and final criterion, if attempts to answer these group-difference questions are fraught with scientific fallacies, might there nonetheless be some public-policy implications making investigation worthwhile? The answer sometimes advanced is that if there were such differences, and their causes were understood, the less well-endowed groups could be &#8216;compensated&rsquo; by some form of differentiated education. But in practice, claims that there are differences in intelligence between blacks and whites, or men and women, have always been used to justify a social hierarchy in which white males continue to occupy the premier positions (whether in the economy in general or natural science in particular). Using pseudoscience, based on concepts as ill-founded as was phlogiston, to justify preordained conclusions should not serve as the basis of sound policy-making.</p>

<p><i>Stephen Ceci &amp; Wendy M. Williams, Nature, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<p>The Soviet Union lost a generation of genetics research to the politicization of science when Trofim Lysenko, director of biology under Joseph Stalin, parlayed his rejection of Mendelian genetics into a powerful political scientific movement. By the late 1920s, Lysenko had denounced academics embracing Mendelian genetics, which some said undermined tenets of Soviet society. His efforts to extinguish &#8216;harmful&rsquo; scientific ideas ruined opponents&rsquo; careers and delayed scientific progress.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine this situation repeating today, when rival views feed the scientific process, and inquiry and debate trump orthodoxy. Yet the spectre of Lysenkoism lurks in current scientific discourse on gender, race and intelligence. Claims that sex- or race-based IQ gaps are partly genetic can offend entire groups, who feel that such work feeds hatred and discrimination. Pressure from professional organizations and university administrators can result in boycotting such research, and even in ending scientific careers.</p>
<p>But hatred and discrimination do not result from allowing scientists to publish their findings, nor does censuring it stamp out hatred. {snip}</p>
<p>There is an emerging consensus about racial and gender equality in genetic determinants of intelligence; most researchers, including ourselves, agree that genes do not explain between-group differences. But some issues remain unresolved, such as identification of mechanisms that bring genetic potential to fruition. Censuring debaters favouring genetic explanations of intelligence differences is not the answer to solving such mysteries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nobel prizewinner William Shockley became a subject of controversy in the 1970s, after his work turned to racial differences in intelligence. In recent decades, the writings, statements and teachings of Arthur Jensen, Michael Levin and John Philippe Rushton, also on racial differences in intelligence, have met variously with acclaim, outcries and demands for job termination. So have writings of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray on the differential distribution of IQ by race. And Frank Ellis, a lecturer at the University of Leeds, UK, took early retirement in the face of an ethical storm that developed after he suggested in a student newspaper that intelligence levels were related to ethnicity. The list goes on. Many have been dissuaded from even looking at the research topic for fear of condemnation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Judged too fast?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>James Watson is the most illustrious scholar to have his career ended for reckless language. Watson&rsquo;s downfall was his assertion that &#8220;all our social policies are based on the fact that [African] intelligence is the same as ours  &mdash;  whereas all the testing says not really&#8221;. Although he hoped everybody was equal, &#8220;people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true&#8221;. Watson instantly plunged from A-list Nobelist to outcast, and was suspended from his chancellorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Watson later clarified in a statement that he does not believe Africans to be genetically inferior, but this had little impact on the controversy.</p>
<p>Watson&rsquo;s first assertion could be read as scientifically supported: black Africans&rsquo; IQ scores are lower than those of white Europeans. But Watson&rsquo;s use of &#8216;intelligence&rsquo; was interpreted as meaning &#8216;intrinsic cognitive ability&rsquo;, ignoring how unfamiliarity with testing format, low quality of schooling, or poor health might depress IQ scores. There have been analyses showing average national IQs for sub-Saharan Africa to be approximately 30 points lower than average IQs for predominantly white European nations, and drawing a racial conclusion from those results. A refutation of these analyses would provide an opportunity to advance understanding. Sadly, although these analyses can be refuted, as we and others have done, most of those who scorned Watson never knew they existed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some scientists hold more &#8216;acceptable&rsquo; views, ourselves included. We think racial and gender differences in IQ are not innate but instead reflect environmental challenges. Although we endorse this view, plenty of scholars remain unpersuaded. Whereas our &#8216;politically correct&rsquo; work garners us praise, speaking invitations and book contracts, challengers are demeaned, ostracized and occasionally threatened with tenure revocation.</p>
<p>Acts of censure edge close to Lysenkoism. They also do a disservice to science. When dissenters&rsquo; positions are prevented exposure in high-impact journals and excluded from conferences, the dominant side goes unchallenged, and eventually its rationale is forgotten, forestalling the evolution of crucial ideas.</p>
<p>James Flynn, the foremost proponent of the environmental basis of intelligence, notes that when he first rebutted Jensen&rsquo;s hereditarian claims 30 years ago, he never anticipated later breakthroughs that evolved from the debate. Without Jensen, he has written, &#8220;I would never have made any contribution to psychology&#8221;. His landmark documentation of the steady rise in IQ scores across generations and nations, known as the Flynn effect, might never have been done.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, vigorous debate has resulted in great progress in our understanding, and more breakthroughs will come  &mdash;  if we allow free speech in science.</p>
<p>One could argue that some peer-reviewed reports feed racial and gender stereotypes. Perhaps such research should be forced to pass a higher cost-benefit threshold before publication. But this is a slippery slope: philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that atheists should be silenced, lest they convince the masses to abandon faith, condemning them to hell. This would now be viewed as a ludicrous violation of free speech. Who is to be impanelled with the wisdom to decide which views can be aired, and which research questions pass muster?</p>
<p>It might also be argued that only primary researchers who are experts in their field, rather than administrators or non-experts, deserve protected speech in these areas. A statement&rsquo;s validity, however, lies in its congruence with scientific data, not in the role occupied by its speaker.</p>
<p>One powerful argument states that groups need protection against bigotry, and that censuring one side in a debate is necessary to prevent the harm done to victims of race and gender arguments. {snip} Such problems, however, arise not from scientific discourse, but from political applications of those ideas. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When scientists are silenced by colleagues, administrators, editors and funders who think that simply asking certain questions is inappropriate, the process begins to resemble religion rather than science. Under such a regime, we risk losing a generation of desperately needed research.<br>

			<p>No, science should not study race and IQ. The scientists should continue to keep their heads buried deep in the sand and ignore anything that could upset our precious elites. </p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m joking. Science will have to study IQ and the correlation with race, especially with the advances being made in in the genone   &mdash;   data bases, DNA comparsions, etc.   &mdash;   and other technologies like high speed computers, gene splicing, etc. </p>
<p>And the rsults will not surprise anyone, except perhaps those who actually drank the politically correct Kool-Aid. The IQ difference of the races, specifically the low intelligence levels of blacks, is as obvious as noting that the sun rises in the East. Well, duh.</p>

			<p>Though I do not agree with Stephen Rose&rsquo;s contention, I will give him this much:  He got through several thousand words on why IQ/Race correlations should not be studied without even one use of the following words:   Hitler, Nazi, Fascist, Holocaust.  That shows some maturity on his part.</p>

			<p>This article seems to suggest there is a controversy as to whether race an IQ should be studied, as if it hasn&rsquo;t been studied or the results are still unknown.  According to the Bell Curve, the issue has been studied exhaustively, the results are clear, and there is no controversy among psychometricians; it is only a raging controversy among those in the mainstream media.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the results of IQ tests seem to only mirror the results of every other test of mental ability: SAT tests and civil service exams, as well as routine college and high school classroom tests consistently show a large gap between whites and blacks.  It has been reported that the average black high school student performs at an eighth grade level, the average black eighth grade student performs at about the average level of a white fourth grade student, and lastly, the average black fourth grader reads so slowly and with such little comprehension that they essentially cannot read at all.</p>
<p>So with so much empirical evidence being ignored, why bother studying the issue again.  The results are all around us, the question is, will society continue to ignore and deny these differences or will society deal with these differences in a constructive and logical manner.  If history is an indicator, my guess is politicians, mainstream journalists, and society will continue to ignore all test results and toe the PC line.  PC doctrine has become a tyrant of no equal.<br>

			<p>Not only is the way people think related to environment, it carries on as hereditary behavior far removed from that environment.  </p>
<p>Whites in Africa still act white, and Africans in England still act African. </p>

<p>Ah yes, Comrade Rose, replace the monosyllabic word &#8220;race&#8221; with a phrase 9 times harder to say, all in the name of &#8220;simplification&#8221; and &#8220;clarity!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>But IQ is clearly a flexible construct &mdash; as amply demonstrated by decisions in the 1930s and 1940s in the United States and Britain to &lsquo;adjust&rsquo; test questions to equalize the scores of boys and girls, because in previous versions of the tests girls had scored higher.</i></p>
<p>Oh, because the concept has taken some effort to find the best way to measure, that means it is invalid and must be thrown out altogether!  And this is supposed to be written by a scientist?!</p>
<p><i>claims that there are differences in intelligence between blacks and whites, or men and women, have always been used to justify a social hierarchy in which white males continue to occupy the premier positions (whether in the economy in general or natural science in particular).</i></p>
<p>So because it &#8220;justifies&#8221; something the author doesn&rsquo;t like, that must mean that it is not only not true, but must not even be studied! I see.</p>

			<p>I have said it one before in a post several months ago and i will say it again, we as Whites spend far too much time discussing and debating IQs. </p>
<p>The fact is that IQ&rsquo;s do not measure a number of important things about a person - ambition, creativity, common sense, racial loyalty (look at all our race traitor Whites brethern with high IQs)or other important factors.</p>
<p>You can look at a number of very successful people and you will find that the majority of them do not have the highest IQs. </p>
<p>We need to rethink this constant obsession with IQs. It is a futile exercise at best. </p>

			<p>Certainly, our ability to measure the intelligence of both individuals and whole groups, is well established beyond serious challenge.  Attempts to discredit this position are borderline ludicrous in their convoluted explanations for the disparities in black-white IQ differentials.  The opponents of IQ test validity seem to have no particular problem with Ashkenazi Jews being at the top of the heap with average IQs of 120, or East Asians outscoring whites by an average of six points. The relative success of these two groups would seem to validate these findings.</p>
<p>But the relative failure of black Africans throughout the modern world, unvarying in its universality, simply cannot be explained by a clear deficit in average intelligence.  Suddenly the tests are &#8220;culturally biased,&#8221; flawed in some other manner, or incogniscent of the &#8220;black experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this mean that black Africans have nothing to contribute in the modern world?  Not at all.  Individual blacks should have the opportunity to reach any level of which they&rsquo;re capable, and that includes the sciences, engineering, medicine, and the arts. And black Africans could contribute as skilled artisans and tradesmen.  But to expect them to reach the same level of representation in the professions as certain other races is unrealistic and, ultimately, cruel to black Africans themselves. </p>

			<p>Read Richard Dawkins&rsquo;s angry attack on Rose&rsquo;s theories:<br>
https://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1985-01-24notinourgenes.shtml</p>
<p>If these leftist commentators are so sure of the truth about IQ and race then why not allow the testing to go ahead, if only to silence &#8216;racists&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Surely one of the benefits of finding out the truth is to stop successful races being blamed for the collective failure of blacks. Or would the socialists prefer to persecute the innocent, in spite of the facts?</p>
<p>And if intelligence is such a slippery concept and &#8216;too difficult&rsquo; to measure, then how we decide who gets special help in society? How do we &#8216;know&rsquo; that Down Syndrome people are less intelligent if intelligence is impossible to measure? Do we allow an adult with an IQ of 50 to be ripped off by an unscrupulous salesman without consequence? Should we put lead back in paint, seeing as studies proving that lead reduces IQ in children are essentially meaningless if IQ means nothing?</p>

			<p>When I first saw the title I thought to myself that this would be a provocative read.  Then I saw it was from &#8220;Science&#8221; and I knew there would be no debate, just more leftist diatribe.</p>
<p>We see here a couple of common leftist tactics:</p>
<p>1) Pointing out other disputes about ethnicity (typically among whites) as if this makes the black/white divide just as insignificant as the others.  This is their way of saying, &#8220;the white/black racial divide is a passing fad&#8221;.  They completely ignore the fact that blacks have been perceived the same way for thousands of years by every civilization that has encountered them.  The ignore the fact that this racial divide is the most relevant today in America and this is why it should be studied.</p>
<p>2) Trying to make an argument against the study of something based on&hellip; none other then so-called studies of that self same thing!  How can you cite research on a topic, in an attempt to dissuade the study of that same topic?  If you&rsquo;re truly interested in the truth, you&rsquo;ll do your own research or at least give equal time to the opposing viewpoint.</p>
<p>The article is just more of the same.  Useless propaganda and drivel.</p>

			<p>The reason why so many on the Left oppose research into race and IQ, is that their entire notion of affirmative action quotas, goals and timetables is based on the BELIEF that all groups have the same IQ.  If, however, The Bell Curve is correct, then if there is a smaller percentage of Blacks in jobs requiring high IQ, then the reason is NOT discrimination, but because most Blacks are unable to achieve on that higher level.  Thus, the politicians who push quotas want no scientific enquiry that might  result in fewer quotas.  These are the politicians who defund any conference or research proposal on such hot topics as race and IQ; race, IQ and crime; race, IQ. and unwed mothers, etc.====HM </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that a respected &#8220;science&#8221; journal would only allow respectable egalitarians to be heard from on either side.  Couldn&rsquo;t someone who has actually been the brunt of Leftist intolerance, such as Jenssen or Rushton, be a more forceful advocate for free inquiry into race and IQ?  On the other hand, maybe a forceful advocate for that position was the last thing this magazine wanted.</p>

			<p>To clarify the issues of race and intelligence, look to the book titled The Urantia Book, published by the Urantia Foundation.</p>
<p>Currently, the intellectuals are going round and round over nothing.  The truth in regard to intelligence and race is right in front of the eyeballs.  There is a reason why Africa and South America is the way it is, genes = inherent abilities.</p>
<p>The latest call of college for every black and hispanic is a complete waste of money.  What is needed most are trade schools so that they get jobs and have self-respect.  This country do not need another subprime mess, putting kids into college when they can barely graduate from high school.  The whole US educational system have been watered down to accomodate the blacks and hispanics when the US used to consistenly number one in international testing.  What insanity. </p>

			<p>The first writer makes no sense:</p>
<p>1) if we refuse to quantify racial IQ difference, that suggests a coverup of something pretty serious.</p>
<p>2) open discussion about the natural causes of black cognitive deficits doesn&rsquo;t stop us from working to reduce them (better nutrition, etc.).</p>
<p>3) once racial differences are recognized, we can stop wasting effort equalizing racial performance, whites are free of guilt, blacks are free to explore their own strengths and weaknesses free of the mirage of (unattanable) IQ equality.</p>
<p>The 2nd writer is also silly:</p>
<p>1) the research has been done, it isn&rsquo;t that hard to control for environmental factors, the Jensen &amp; Rushton collaboration of 2005 names 10 separate criteria all of which indicate inherited black cognitive deficits.</p>
<p>2) scholars like J&R; are doing real research - they are not there simply as foils for environment-only fanatics like these authors.</p>
<p>3) the facts are already established it is a question of breaking down the firewall separating science from piblic discussion. </p>

			<p>Why should there be a debate over whether we should answer a question or not? How do races differ in terms of intelligence? If you&rsquo;re so sure you&rsquo;re right why not allow someone to oppose your ideals? Anyone suggesting we should not study race and IQ is probably afraid the conclusions will not correspond with their ideology. </p>

			<p>The question: &#8220;Should Scientists Study Race and IQ?&#8221; is itself a question from the all-too-familiar leftist big brother mentality, and wouldn&rsquo;t even occur to a genuine scientist.</p>
<p>In science there are no questions to not ask or study. </p>
<p>Exploring the range of mental capacity of races that populate a society would obviously enhance decision making for thousands of aspects of educational and business planning.</p>
<p>&hellip;But wait, this could only happen in a society of fear-free rational people&hellip;</p>
<p>Never mind. <br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;as amply demonstrated in the 1930s and 1940s in Britain and the United States to &#8216;adjust&rsquo; test questions to equalize the scores of boys and girls, because in previous tests girls had scored higher.&#8221; <br>
      False.  It was decided to give greater weight to verbal aptitude and less to math, because boys better showing in math gave them, on average, higher IQs than girls.  <br>

			<p>Surely the connection between race and IQ should not be investigated any further simply because the results a la Rushton etc are so well established that further research would be a duplication of effort and a waste of money.</p>

			<p>The modern dogma on race - that everyone is equal - we&rsquo;re starting to see is enforced.  Individuals differ in their abilities and qualities, and some people excel.  There will always be some who will not try to better themselves, and so come to hate those who do.  This is what we&rsquo;re seeing today.  The language used to justify that hatred is that the successful become successful by &#8216;oppressing&rsquo; their fellow man - the assertion is that nobody earns their rewards, but instead steals them from others.</p>
<p>As this philosophy spreads, we&rsquo;ll see that a it&rsquo;s supporters will come to see themselves perpetually as oppressed and abused by anybody who is not an adherent to that philosphy - multicultaralism and egalitarianism.  This justification will be used to rob the who do to give to those who do nothing.  We already see it used to justify the mass rape of whites in America by blacks; its because of societies &#8220;oppression&#8221; i.e. it&rsquo;s the fault of the victims that they&rsquo;re raped, because they deserve it.  The same is true of affirmative action, which is only large scale state-enforced robbery of whites.  It&rsquo;s also justified by saying that all wealth, all success of whites is due to the oppression of non-whites.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing is the birth of a hideous philosophy that embraces death over life, hatred over love, misery over joy - all in the name of equality and bettering our fellow man.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m really agreeing with other comments already made. Yeah the question is &#8220;do we really want to open that can of worms&#8221;?<br>
And do people really want to know the truth when it&rsquo;s unpopular.</p>
<p>When it comes to black people specifically it seems that your Government thinks that most of their problems are connected to low self esteem, must be because they are such a shy and retiring people.<br>
And as long as the only differences discussed are positive, everything will be fine.<br>
Can&rsquo;t have the worker bees feeling sad. <br>
&#8220;Everything is good all of the time, Hooray&#8221;!</p>
<p>If IQ differences were proven to be racial by the establishment, wouldn&rsquo;t that just be an excuse for more expensive &#8216;special help&rsquo;.<br>

			<p>ask any teacher in a predominately black high school who has also taught in a predominantly white high school if there are inate differences. Many blacks are not poor, have federal or private jobs with good salaries, and yet produce children who struggle with English, never read at home, and barely can compute above arithmetic, regardless of grade. SAT scores continue to document the objective differences.</p>

			<p>If the Left is successful, only Western science on intelligence will stop.  You can be sure that the Chinese, Japanese, and others will continue to research the molecular basis for intelligence.  This will result in genetic engineering.  I imagine the mathematics graduates of the University of Beijing and University of Tokyo in year 2100 will be able to do double integrals and multiple regressions in their head.</p>

			<p>I agree with Dagworthy. The cultural Marxists will most likely secretly support genetic research in intelligence to benefit their own offspring and class while publicly decrying such work, stomping all over the &#8220;average&#8221; white in this and every other area. The E. Asians are under no such illusions and will pour a great deal of money and effort into this. I expect the Indians and possibly Russians to do the same. But in the US and the rest of West, no way, unless things change drastically. </p>

			<p>forgot to say, but its very important:</p>
<p>thousands of well-paid psychologists HAVE beeen trying to prove there is NO racial diffference in cognitive abilities, and if they had managed come up with even the a tiniest shred of evidence, we would have heard about it by now.</p>
<p>A scientist with credible proof that the races were equal in intelligence would win a Nobel, have a cabinet posiiton in the US governemnt, a weekly NYT column, his own TV show, &amp; would receive $ 100,00 for each speaking engagement. </p>
