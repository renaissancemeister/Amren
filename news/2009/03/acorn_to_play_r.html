<h1>ACORN to Play Role in 2010 Census</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cristina Corbin, FOXNews.com, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Census is supposed to be free of politics, but one group with a history of voter fraud, ACORN, is participating in next year&rsquo;s count, raising concerns about the politicization of the decennial survey.</p>
<p>The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now signed on as a national partner with the U.S. Census Bureau in February 2009 to assist with the recruitment of the 1.4 million temporary workers needed to go door-to-door to count every person in the United States  &mdash;  currently believed to be more than 306 million people.</p>
<p>A U.S. Census &#8220;sell sheet,&#8221; an advertisement used to recruit national partners, says partnerships with groups like ACORN &#8220;play an important role in making the 2010 Census successful,&#8221; including by &#8220;help[ing] recruit census workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bureau is currently employing help from more than 250 national partners, including TARGET and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), to assist in the hiring effort.</p>
<p>But ACORN&rsquo;s partnership with the 2010 Census is worrisome to lawmakers who say past allegations of fraud should raise concerns about the organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a concern, especially when you look at all the different charges of voter fraud. And it&rsquo;s not just the lawmakers&rsquo; concern. It should be the concern of every citizen in the country,&#8221; Rep. Lynn A. Westmoreland, R-Ga., vice ranking member of the subcommittee for the U.S. Census, told FOXNews.com. &#8220;We want an enumeration. We don&rsquo;t want to have any false numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>ACORN, which claims to be a non-partisan grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people, came under fire in 2007 when Washington State filed felony charges against several paid ACORN employees and supervisors for more than 1,700 fraudulent voter registrations. In March 2008, an ACORN worker in Pennsylvania was sentenced for making 29 phony voter registration forms. The group&rsquo;s activities were frequently questioned in the 2008 presidential election.</p>
<p>ACORN spokesman Scott Levenson told FOXNews.com that &#8220;ACORN as an organization has not been charged with any crime.&#8221; He added that fears that the organization will unfairly influence the census are unfounded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Westmoreland and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, a member of the House census subcommittee, said the panel has held hearings to make sure the penalties for census takers committing fraud are clearly defined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau has refuted any suggestions that ACORN or any other groups will fraudulently and unduly influence the results of the census.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Census (Bureau) is a nonpartisan, non-political agency and we&rsquo;re very dedicated to an accurate account,&#8221; bureau spokesman Stephen Buckner told FOXNews.com. &#8220;We have a lot of quality controls in place to keep any kind of systemic error or fraudulent behavior to affect the counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Buckner acknowledged that it is difficult to track an applicant&rsquo;s political background.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no way of tracking any of that information,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If somebody comes in to a position with a political agenda and their work exhibits that, there are rules against that,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>How about the Council of Conservative Citizens going out and recruiting census takers?  I could only wish, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>

			<p>my freind a white male applied for a census job, months ago and still has yet to hear anything, so this whole business of ACORN helping fill spots is baloney its only to help the &#8220;right&#8221; people get jobs<br>

			<p>I got 95 percent on my Census employment test.  The work begins in April but I have not received any job offer yet.  ACORN, LARAZA, and other US terror groups will get the jobs.   The BLACK controlled Federal Government has declared war on the WHITE majoriety.  </p>

			<p>The census hasn&rsquo;t even been taken, and its integrity has already been seriously compromised. Well done, B. Hussein.</p>

			<p>It seems a few people are beginning to realize that the Obamanistas are planning to politicize the 2010 census as part of their plan to establish permanent one-party rule of the USSA.  Millions of previously missed &#8220;citizens&#8221; will be discovered in urban areas, which are already permanently dominated by the CPUSA under the trade name &#8220;Democratic Party&#8221;.  This will concentrate more congressional seats in these enclaves, and permanently marginalize the conservative rural areas of the country.  The Republican Party will still exist as a toadying bunch of collaborators, just as they are in the California legislature today, offering no substantive opposition to anything the majority party wants.  Thus ends the Great Experiment.  </p>

			<p>Think how efficient that will be. ACORN will be able to count and register shadow people to vote all at the same time.</p>
<p>I believe two things will happen. 1) the numbers will be so  skewed to the left as to be meaningless and laughable. 2) some federal judge will rule that those distorted numbers must be accepted. </p>
<p>My guess is ACORN will be able find at least 25-30% more left wing voters that were overlooked. </p>
<p>It will next to impossible for anyone other than a Democrat to win a major election in the future.  </p>

			<p>If it weren&rsquo;t so tragic, I&rsquo;d have thought this news article was a satire.  ACORN in charge of census???  You have to be joking..?</p>

			<p>ACORN is not our only worry. This organization will be only one of many who will bring more crime and shame to our nation. We&rsquo;re in for one scandal after another. Our forefathers must be weeping.</p>

			<p>I either won&rsquo;t respond to the census, or since &#8220;they&#8221; send people around to question you if you do not respond, I will submit incorrect information, and incorrect names.  Someone said it was illegal not to participate in the census.  I don&rsquo;t know if that is true or not, but in this day and age, I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it.</p>

			<p>(from the snipped part of the article): <i>Each applicant&hellip;must take a basic skills exam, which includes reading a map and entering data into a handheld computer. Applicants are also subject to an FBI background check.</i></p>
<p>Well, that should disqualify about 90% of all ACORNers. </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;We&rsquo;re not crooks&#8221; whine: I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day a gang of blacks would channel the ghost of Richard Nixon!</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say, they&rsquo;ll write down what they want. If they need minority single mothers that have dropped out of school, and are making less than $5,000 a year, guess what you&rsquo;ve just become.</p>

			<p>leave it to liberal democrats to again put tradition, the commerce dept. handles the census, in the sewer.</p>
<p>the ends justify the means with liberals. they continue to try to change the u.s. from capitalistic to socialistic. they will use any means possible to obtain the aforementioned objective.</p>
<p>this is one of the most dangerous periods of time in american history. </p>

			<p>The census will also be used to break-up any &#8220;too white&#8221; neighborhoods.<br>
If they can&rsquo;t find enough blacks to relocate into areas that are over 80% white (target areas), they will import them from Africa.<br>
Government (the anti-white liberals and neo-cons alike) believe that segregation is expensive and integration of all neighborhoods is the spirit of the Fair Housing Act. They say that the data show that integration improves quality of life!<br>
The goal is integration of all cities over 20,000 to a ratio of no more than 60% white and at least 40% non-white.<br>
This is pure racial hatred against whites.<br>
The reason that any majority-white cities exist at all is because of lack of funding for HUD and non-cooperation of the DOJ.</p>
