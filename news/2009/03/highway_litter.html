<h1>Highway Litter Program Can&rsquo;t Bar Group, Official Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Wiegand, Sacramento Bee, March 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is there is no way to deny these folks regardless of how we feel about them,&#8221; Kempton [state Transportation Department chief Will Kempton] said in a meeting with a dozen Latino legislators and representatives of minority organizations. &#8220;We will lose in court if we try to eliminate these folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latino lawmakers are angry that Caltrans issued a litter pickup permit to the San Diego Minutemen for a stretch of Interstate 5 that straddles a major immigration checkpoint south of San Clemente.</p>
<p>The group contends it is a patriotic organization that seeks to ensure U.S. immigration and border security laws are enforced. But critics contend Minutemen are racist vigilantes that use intimidation and harassment against immigrant rights activists.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they were people of color,&#8221; said Assemblywoman Lori Saldaña, D-San Diego, &#8220;they would be labeled a gang.&#8221; Saldaña said she has been repeatedly harassed by group members at public events in her district.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Minutemen President Jeff Schwilk responded that &#8220;we wouldn&rsquo;t waste five minutes on Lori Saldaña except to respond to her wild charges that lack one bit of truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Minutemen are suing several state officials and legislators for allegedly conspiring to deny the group&rsquo;s free-speech rights by revoking its permit and taking down the sign. A federal judge ordered the permit and sign restored until the case is decided.</p>
<p>Kempton said Monday that the moratorium has resulted in about 1,200 miles of roadside not being cleaned by volunteers.</p>

			<p>Yet if &#8216;controversial&rsquo; groups of self-proclaimed murderers like the Bloods and the Crips declared a truce to help clean up litter, they would be embraced and it would be on the front page of the NYT and every left wing blog declaring how blacks were getting their groove back or some such similar jive-talk nonsense.</p>

			<p>All these Minutemen have ever done is &#8220;report&#8221; illegal aliens breaking into the country.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t so much as breathed hard on anyone, yet all the diversity mongers are always referring to them as &#8220;racists&#8221;, &#8220;vigilantes, &#8220;hatemongers&#8221;, etc. </p>
<p>Can any of the amren posters inform us of the &#8220;worst&#8221; thing the minutemen have actually ever done ?</p>

<p>Talk about ignorance.  I hear there are blacks in the group, and Native Americans, and even Hispanics.</p>

<p>The NAACP are &#8220;people of color&#8221;, so is the Congressional Black Caucus.  Are they gangs?  What about MALDEF, MECHA, La Raza, etc., etc.  Actually, now that I think about it, the above groups do have a &#8220;gang&#8221; thing about them. </p>

<p>Correction:  they would be called a civil rights group only seeking justice for their people, like the wonderful &#8220;organization&#8221; called La Raza that has hosted speeches from non other than the likes of Hillary Clinton, John McCain - and of course - St. Obama.</p>

<p>I can tell you.  They handed out water and anti-diarrhetics to illegal aliens trying to sneak into the U.S. through the worst part of the southern Arizona desert, as the Mexican &#8220;government&#8221; (read: gang of Caucasian plutocrats) has a semi-official policy of hogging all of Mexico&rsquo;s wealth for itself and not sharing any of it with their mostly Mestizo/Amerindian population, and in turn encouraging them to &#8220;migrate&#8221; northward so that we can share our wealth with them.</p>
<p>As for trash, the Minuteman volunteers on a once a year basis (maybe more) clean up areas of empty desert of trash lying around dropped by illegal aliens on their migratory route.</p>

<p>A &#8216;gang&rsquo; in my little dictionary is explained as &#8220;a group working or acting together&#8221; and since Congress and Senate are acting together against the taxpaying, citizen slaves they qualify as GANGS!</p>

			<p>It seems that eventually, the only people liberals will denounce will be white men who stand up for themselves (or those of the chosen races who aid them).  Or is it just me?</p>
<p>Eventually, behaving in a way sure to be denounced by liberals as &#8220;evil&#8221; will become a moral duty of all white men of conscience and character.</p>

<p>This is what happens when you allow aliens into your midst.  They attempt to decapitate your state and society.  They attack you from perches in the institutions your forefathers created.  When you attempt to defend yourself and your civilization, they denounce you openly. Simple, really.</p>

<p> Dared to oppose &#8220;our&#8221; monolithic federal government. Dared<br>
to suggest to &#8220;our&#8221; government that immigration laws be <br>
upheld. And doing the job that &#8220;our&#8221; government refuses to<br>
do. &#8220;Our&#8221; government and it&rsquo;s legions of leftist lackeys,<br>
don&rsquo;t take so kindly to things like that.</p>

			<p>Maybe, just maybe, we are starting to get our cahones back and will stop letting everyone not white put US down? WE BUILT AMERICA into the envey of the WORLD, Now We Want To Apologize for that (bull no way) Now we need to show how proud we are of what we have done.. And when they put our country down tell them if you don&rsquo;t like it here go back to the paradise you fled.</p>

<p>Well, what if they do? Racist &#8220;immigrant rights&#8221; activists, AKA foreign intelligence agents/special forces do the same to them. </p>

			<p>I have some first hand experience with enforcing a litter ordinance and keeping streets and highways clean.  There is no litter problem in white neighborhoods.  There is a significant litter problem in minority neighborhoods.  Residents of these neighborhoods trash their own streets and yards and expect the local and state governments to clean it up.  And they do.</p>
