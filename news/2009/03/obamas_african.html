<h1>Obama&rsquo;s African Blood Lines Are Not a Gateway to Success</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Gilmore, Ebony/Jet, March 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the March 11, 2009 issue of the newspaper, The Financial Times, U.S. President, Barack Obama is first amongst a list of 50 individuals who will &#8220;frame a way forward&#8221; through the world&rsquo;s current global financial crisis. It is quite an honor and sight to see.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While it is impressive that a man of African descent, Obama, heads the list, there are two points to be made about the list that are more noteworthy.</p>
<p>First, while Mr. Obama is #1, he is the only person on the list of African descent. Mr. Obama is not in charge of an African nation, company, or institution; he is President of the United States.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, while FT&rsquo;s list of 50 financial players in the world today is full of European movers and shakers, the list is also filled with representatives from Asian countries and institutions. {snip}</p>
<p>Wen Jiabao, Prime Minister of China (2nd), and Wang Qishan, Vice Primer of China (10th), are both on the list. Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of People&rsquo;s Bank of China is there (15th) as is Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor Bank of Japan (18th).</p>
<p>The presence of Asian players on the list tells all of us what most of us already know: Asia is a serious economic player in the world. Asia is the reason President Barack Obama is trying to address energy, health care, and education issues in his domestic reform agenda. U.S. companies are suffocating under the pressure of Asian economic development. The U.S. borrows money from Asian banks regularly, and that, we all know, is financial suicide.</p>
<p>The second issue the list exposes  &mdash;  the lack of any real economic players of African descent on the list except for Barack Obama  &mdash;  is disappointing to say the least.</p>
<p>Months ago, China successfully pressured the U.S. to bailout mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because a significant portion of China&rsquo;s GNP is invested in those companies. Fannie and Freddie couldn&rsquo;t fail because China might tank. And if China&rsquo;s financial system tanks, where will the U.S. turn for quick cash?</p>
<p>In contrast, the most noteworthy news story coming out of Africa last year was economic as well: Robert Mugabe, the leader of Zimbabwe, and the man viciously subjecting his people to cholera laden water, starvation, and authoritarian rule, had somehow driven the inflation rate in that country to an incomprehensible 200 million percent.</p>
<p>Years ago, I recall poet Haki Madhubuti, the Chicago based black institution builder, noting that there is not a product or company of global notoriety that originates in the African world. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to understand Madhubuti&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Note, of the top 100 Global corporations, as reported last year by Forbes Magazine, not one is African based or a company founded in Africa by black Africans. {snip}</p>
<p>Instead of challenging the obvious, African countries and Africans collectively should seek to become political and economic players of serious consequence in the near future on their own terms or on the world&rsquo;s terms.</p>

			<p>No product or company of global notoriety that originates in the African world?  Here in Britain, Nigerian internet scams are indeed notorious.  As are Nigerians themselves.</p>
<p>But anyway, aren&rsquo;t we all Africans really?</p>

<p>Is this not the answer?</p>
<p>While the west and the east have had ups and downs, the fact is, both have long periods of ups interspersed with downs.</p>
<p>When has a black African leader of a black African nation created wealth and prosperity for their nation? If black leaders were producing positive results, they would be included. Unfortunately, blacks continue to prove in most situations that they can&rsquo;t maintain a viable economy. Most African economies exist through handouts from the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
<p>If you were looking for financial advise, who would you turn to, a man who has proven he can make money or a man who does nothing but beg for money?</p>

			<p>Actually Obama isn&rsquo;t even 50% African. His mother was white. All children, but boys especially, get more DNA from their mothers than from their fathers. Mitochondrial DNA, which has about 40 genes, is only inherited from the mother. Boys receive substantially more DNA from their mothers. The Y chromosome that they get from their fathers and which makes them male only has around 50-80 genes. The X chromosome, however, has 1500-2000 genes. Obama is thus about 51-52% European. Blacks will discover this fact soon after Obama finishes the worst presidential term in American history.</p>

			<p>Barack Obama does not deserve to be on that list.  When the economy fails and we go into a depression partly due to Obama&rsquo;s assistance of the wrong people, an excuse or excuses will be found to exonerate him.  Many of his capabilities derive from his White ancestry not his Black side.  Of course this would never be stated publicly.  Most successful Blacks are not completely Black, but are partly White.</p>

			<p>Never forget that Europe had a dark age of almost a thousand years if not more, while arab, chinese, and indian civilizations developed beyond past them. Africa lets us see what the european dark ages would have been like if the endless senseless wars and rebellions of that age had been fought with 20th century weapons and ideologies. I doubt we will see it in our lifetimes, but Africa and the africans will emerge from their dark ages some day  &mdash;  Imagine yourself a turk in 1300, conquering eastern europe and talking  about how these stupid and savage europeans have always been hopeless, that the Roman Empire was overrated and anyway south italy was mostly arab and african, and so on. The obvious lesson is that the facts of our current historical era are true, but we cannot say they represent some eternal truth, nor can we use them to make accurate predictions indefinitely. The racists of the 19th century insisted that orientals were intellectually inferior, the same as africans and now not even &#8220;race realists&#8221; will argue that there is anything inferior about Japan. Jared Taylor included  &mdash;  he grew up there!</p>

<p>Yea.</p>
<p><br>
Not going to happen.</p>
<p>Reality cannot be denied. Africans can never make themselves a first world people of a first world country brought up and raised by them exclusively. I don&rsquo;t even say this out of malice. It&rsquo;s actually kind of sad that they as well as much of the world have been deluded by an ideology that tells them they&rsquo;re the equals they are not. It isn&rsquo;t their fault. It&rsquo;s our inept Liberal brethren. </p>

<p>  The concept of the &#8216;dark age&rsquo; is a post medieval invention which portrays that age unfairly primitive. In many practical inventions, Europeans were ahead of those Chinese, Indians whoever. </p>
<p> &#8220;Africa lets us see what the european dark ages would have been like if the endless senseless wars and rebellions of that age had been fought with 20th century weapons and ideologies. I doubt we will see it in our lifetimes, but Africa and the africans will emerge from their dark ages some day &mdash; Imagine yourself a turk in 1300, conquering eastern europe and talking about how these stupid and savage europeans have always been hopeless, that the Roman Empire was overrated and anyway south italy was mostly arab and african, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Unlike those Europeans, Africans are low IQ humans. So any chance of Africans doing a british Empire is nearly impossible.<br>
 <br>

Jared Taylor included &mdash; he grew up there!&#8221;</p>
<p>    Racists in the 19th century had a far higher opinion about orientals than they had about Africans. There is so much literature in that century which rightfully predicted the possibility of Asians being a serious treat to Europeans in the future. Read the works of Lothrop Stoddard if you do not belive me.</p>

<p>  I&rsquo;d hardly call the empire that gave us our laws, engineering, republican government, sanitary plumbing, Romance languages, religion, architecture, etc. overrated.  The Arabs only occupied Sicily for a brief time after the fall of the Roman Empire. The Greeks occupied Sicily longer than anyone, and founded many of their cities. Despite bogus series like HBO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rome&#8221; (that made ancient Rome resemble modern day London) blacks were really not a significant part of the Roman Empire. </p>

Regardless of who thought what back when, the Asians and the Europeans had a civilization with modern tools/equipment and housing (for that era) dating back thousands of years.  In the meantime, the black Africans have been unable to develop a written language.</p>
<p>It is what it is.  <br>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the delicious irony of it - these people <i>don&rsquo;t believe in nature</i>. It&rsquo;s all about nurture to them! How many times have we heard that what we really need to do to fix African American education or any other massive problem related to blacks <i>is more money</i> or <i>another government program</i>?</p>
<p>But then when someone of only African <i>nature</i> comes along - Obama, or Halle Berry, or any other number of Halfricans abandoned by their black fathers and raised by their white mothers - suddenly nature matters!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the delicious irony of it and we should never forget it. &#8220;Nature doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; - but they think it does.</p>

<p>I have often thought about that - that maybe Africa is trying to feel its way around, just like Europe. But remember that India, Arabia, and China weren&rsquo;t really that far ahead of Europe - oh but China had calligraphy! and gunpowder! and acupuncture. Europe could not have conquered 90% of the world without embracing these technologies and without some level of peace at home.</p>
<p>Secondly, what really matters is what they did when they were exposed to advanced technologies and ideas - they embraced them and taught them in their schools and built upon them. Africa has been exposed to these ideas and technologies for 200 years, and has done what? And it&rsquo;s not just Africa that hasn&rsquo;t really embrace them - it&rsquo;s blacks all over. Nowhere have blacks really &#8220;caught on.&#8221; If whites in the USA all picked up and moved to  Canada tomorrow what would happen to the USA? How long would any semblance of America survive? Detroit tells us. Washington, D.C. tells us. South Africa, which still does have a few whites running the place, tells us.</p>
<p>No, the real answer is that the less impulsive, less violent Africans are going to have to figure out a way to gain control over the more violent and impulsive ones, and keep them from contributing to the gene pool. I have long thought that AIDs could be helping to do that, except we&rsquo;re helping to keep them alive.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what a lot of people don&rsquo;t get about Amrener&rsquo;s and others - not too many people here are actually happy about black misery (though we may sound like it, having been brainwashed and told to shut up for too long). No one&rsquo;s happy that Africa lays in ruins because of black misery. No one&rsquo;s happy about black crime rates. And no one should be.</p>

			<p>Sardonicus:</p>
<p>I doubt that the Romans had any knowledge that there was such a thing as black people in the world, mainly because a desert separated their north African part of the empire and black Africa.  Perhaps there was some incidental contact between the military and Nubians in the far stretches of their holdings in Egypt, but I don&rsquo;t know if the Nubians were truly African black in the modern parlance.</p>
<p>The Romans and Chinese were aware of each other, though.</p>

<p>The Romans knew about them. Juvenal mentions blacks in one of his satires/poems. I believe Nero and some of the other Julian Emperors had some black slaves, probably bought from the Egyptians. However, you&rsquo;re right that they were generally uncommon. In the &ldquo;Rome&#8221; HBO series blacks seemed to be 10% to 20% of the Roman populi. I really hated the depiction of Cicero, Marc Anthony and Caesar in that flawed series. I Claudius was much better historically. </p>

			<p>There are occasional mocking references to miscegenation in Roman literature, especially in the satirical poetry of Juvenal and Martial. They were statistically insignificant by modern standards, however. </p>
<p>That Rome was or is &#8220;overrated&#8221; is simply an ignorant claim, as is the comparison of &#8220;dark ages&#8221; Europe to Africa. In fact these had exactly opposite cultural trajectories. The material foundations of late classical/early medieval European civilization had largely collapsed, and had to be patiently rebuilt over several centuries. That is no mean feat. Compare it to South Africa or Zimbabwe, wholly modern technological societies handed over <i>in toto</i> to blacks, both of which are headed back to the Stone Age under black control.</p>

			<p>president obama, his wife michele and his daughters should immediately stop this disgraceful and shameful discussion about a dog to get for the white house. just get the dog and never discuss it at press conferences or on 60 minutes on on the media ever again. it reflects their mental focus on something that is not dignified for a president nor his family. if this president ever hopes to get my support and vote for re-election the disgraceful public discussion of a dog as a pet should stop immediately for his entire term of office.</p>
