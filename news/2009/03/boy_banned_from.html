<h1><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2009/03/obama_portland_student_talent.html">Boy Banned From Wearing Obama Mask in Skit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Roberts, The Oregonian (Portland), March 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A mask similar to one President Barack Obama himself wore in a &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; skit prompted a Portland school principal to ban a boy from performing while wearing it at his elementary school talent show after deciding the rubber likeness of the 44th president was &#8220;inappropriate and potentially offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dru Lechert-Kelly, 11, a fifth-grader at Llewellyn Elementary School in Southeast Portland, decided to dress up like his role model and dance to a popular YouTube song that features an Obama look-alike dancing to a parody called &#8220;I Can Do Whatever I Like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dru performed the skit in front of teachers and students during a rehearsal for Llewellyn&rsquo;s annual talent show Thursday. He wore a navy blue suit, white shirt, red tie, black shoes and an Obama mask purchased at a costume shop. The choreographed routine ended with Dru on the floor in the splits.</p>
<p>&#8220;He practiced for weeks,&#8221; said Scott Lechert, 50, an instructional designer, who along with his partner, Paul Kelly, 55, a physical therapist, adopted Dru from a Romanian orphanage in 1999 at age 1 1/2. Both dads helped Dru design his stage props  &mdash;  a desk with a large presidential seal stuck to the front with duct tape. And both coached their son to &#8220;have lots of bop&#8221; and &#8220;use your shoulders&#8221; during his routine.</p>
<p>After Thursday&rsquo;s performance, the &#8220;crowd went wild,&#8221; Dru said. But so did some of the adults in the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I talked to the parents who are coordinating the talent show, and they feel it&rsquo;s inappropriate and potentially offensive,&#8221; Llewellyn Principal Steve Powell said.</p>
<p>When asked what was offensive about Dru&rsquo;s skit, Powell refused to discuss it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&rsquo;t say why it&rsquo;s inappropriate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not saying anything to The Oregonian. Why? Because I don&rsquo;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Friday, Dru decided not to perform at all  &mdash;  opting instead to attend a roller-skating party.</p>
<p>The reasons, according to Dru: The skit doesn&rsquo;t make sense without the mask, and he&rsquo;s a little too shy to do it without the mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&rsquo;t have the mask,&#8221; Dru said Friday, &#8220;it&rsquo;s just some kid up there dancing around.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand the history of black face and how African Americans were caricatured by it,&#8221; Lechert said. &#8220;However, we now have a popular biracial president who is admired by white and nonwhite people. At what point will it become OK for an 11-year-old admirer to dress up as the president without fear of offending someone?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are white, but we&rsquo;re a minority class,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have some insight into this process of what is and what isn&rsquo;t offensive. There was obviously no intent to harm here  &mdash;  or really any possibility of offending anyone.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say if this is a case of &#8220;political correctness&#8221; or not. Would the school have acted the same way if the kid wanted to wear a Bush mask and do the same skit when Bush was president? Whenever you inject politics or a political figure into this kind of show, you have the chance of raising people&rsquo;s hackles. People are just more tongue tied in discussing it in this case because of the racial angle.</p>

			<p>LOL.  I can see what the problem is.  It looks to me like an updated blackface routine like they used to do back in the 1920s.  Seriously, this kid needs to get a life and find real heroes to look up to, although his upbringing probably played a factor in warping this kid&rsquo;s mind.</p>

			<p>Trust me that &#8220;popular Bi-racial president&#8221; will not be popular for very long. Also he identifies with ONLY ONE RACE.</p>

<p>These &#8216;two dads&rsquo; are using their &#8216;son&rsquo; as a political prop. Yet anther example of why gay adoptions should be questioned. Their motive for adaption appears to be, at least in part, molding a social activist for the left.</p>
<p>I hope, when this kid grows up, he realizes how he&rsquo;s been used by his &#8216;two dads&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The poor little Red bastard, just got a dose of reality!</p>
<p>Hey kid, that mulatto General Secretary might be your &#8220;role model,&#8221; but you have to understand that he is the our &#8220;savior&#8221; too.</p>
<p>It is always &#8220;offensive&#8221; to parody him, since it detracts from his wondrous &#8220;achievements&#8221; and &#8220;powers.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>There is so much&hellip;wrong&hellip;in this single article, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to pick a point to begin. Seriously, it&rsquo;s like a parody of a parody. So, I&rsquo;ll just laugh and leave it where it belongs. In the dustbin of liberal minds taking themselves way too seriously. </p>

<p><br>
This is a great example of how our liberal education system is destroying White America.  Whites are taught to hate themselves so much that for many the only way to relieve the guilt is to become a &#8220;protected minority&#8221; themselves.  The multicult creates this cognitive dissonance between glorifying minorities and being white, and that&rsquo;s what is causing so many of our young men to become wiggers or homosexuals and our young women to become lesbians or &#8220;sexual reparationists&#8221;.  From kindergarten through college, our schools are teaching students that it&rsquo;s NOT OK to be white and heterosexual.  After all, then you might end up propagating the white race, the root of all evil, which needs to be wiped off the planet and never heard from again.</p>

			<p>As a Portland resident, I all I can say this does not surprise me at all.  Many people here are so left-minded that they cannot deal with the issue of race.  Unless it&rsquo;s putting a minority on a pedestal.  It&rsquo;s even taboo to mention how run down &amp; dangerous the north side of Portland is because that is where all the blacks reside.</p>
<p>As a 27 year old, I really believe that white people my age have been taught their whole lives to be ashamed of white history and to celebrate the history of other cultures.  This has created a racial identity crisis amongst whites.  This is why you see white kids dressed like &#8220;wiggers&#8221; and such.  They have been taught that the way they are is bad, so they look to identify with a socially praised group.  </p>
<p>Personally, I come from Irish, English, and Germanic descent and couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it.  </p>

			<p>I remember Dan Quayle calling for legal reforms. I think reform will only come from the left. It will take whites, and men, and apple-pie types, sueing left and right for the legal system to be reformed.</p>
<p>For the poster who wrote, </p>
<p>&#8220;Whites are taught to hate themselves so much that for many the only way to relieve the guilt is to become a &ldquo;protected minority&rdquo; themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with the first part, but I also agree whites should try and become a protected group. Whites are people too and not simply oppressors. Whites need to talk about their experiences being white. The problem is, here you go from being a punching-bag like conservative to being something unspeakable. Here you become &#8216;Nazi-like&rsquo; if you dared be spoken of all (and I know we shouldn&rsquo;t allow others to define us).</p>
<p>No amount of conservatism is going to prevent white liberals and people of color from speaking out on behalf of people of color, from being naked racists. It&rsquo;s kind of late for that. Whites need to speak up for themselves too. If only to achieve the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; which they themselves &#8216;mandate&rsquo; for us. Whites need to speak up for themselves too, if only to End the cult of victimhood (for everyone who isn&rsquo;t white). If only to make whites human beings too - the greatest sin today it would seem. As a &#8216;conservative&rsquo; you may think it a contradition to join the &#8216;victim&rsquo; bandwagon but in truth it is the only thing that can turn the country in a more centrist direction. At least in attitude.</p>

			<p>How long have people worn president masks? Patrick Swayze made a film called Point Break where 4 surfers rob banks wearing masks of Reagan, Carter, Nixon, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s now considered a thought-crime to wear a mask of the Mulatto Messiah.<br>

<p>Llewellyn Elementary School is overwhelmingly White with only 14 blacks.  I understand why this kid is the way he is.  He lives in a hermetically sealed environment with no outside contact with the real world.  I prescribe a good dose of school diversity from &#8220;da hood&#8221; as the cure.  A couple of months of his lunch money being taken and stares accompanied by &#8220;Whatchoo lookin at b*t*c*&#8221; will cure his passion for Obamaphilia.  </p>

			<p>     Why is it offensive? Maybe because it hits too close to<br>
home. Maybe the Libtards are afraid that the one they call Obama<br>
is not what he pretends to be. They do well to be afraid. The<br>
smart ones already know they&rsquo;ve been duped, but they&rsquo;re too proud<br>
to ever admit it. Not in a million years.</p>
