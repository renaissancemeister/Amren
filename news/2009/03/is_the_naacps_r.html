<h1>Is the NAACP&rsquo;s Relevance Fading?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julian Bond and Benjamin Todd Jealous, The New Republic, March 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black unemployment perennially remains twice that of whites. When white unemployment was 9.8 percent in 1982, it was considered an unacceptable crisis. Blacks today have an unemployment rate over 12 percent and climbing. Median earnings for black men is 74.2 percent of the median for white men. Yet, according to several studies, there is no variable  &mdash;  neither education, test scores, nor experience  &mdash;  that provides a scientific rationale. In two recent studies, white employers preferred white males with a criminal background to equally qualified African American men without one.</p>
<p>In 2005, African American borrowers paid an average of 128 basis points more for loans than their white counterparts with equal income and credit. In the subprime market, the difference was even greater  &mdash;  275 basis points more. Federal data, from a 2008 study, documents that people of color are more than three times more likely to have subprime loans causing one of the greatest losses of wealth from the African American community.</p>
<p>When white and minority youth were charged with the same criminal offenses, African-American youth with no prior admissions were six times more likely to be incarcerated than white youth with the same background.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}When we successfully fought to end lynch mobs against African Americans, we also ended the mob violence against Italians and Catholics, other groups who were targeted for lynchings in the south. When we fought for political inclusion, it paved the way for the inclusion of gays, women, and individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>Had NAACP been listened to on banking, our nation might have avoided today&rsquo;s calamity. {snip} Borrowers  &mdash;  mostly homeowners with good credit  &mdash;  were steered into the subprime market reaping huge profits for the brokers and igniting the phenomena that has devastated millions of American families. {snip}</p>
<p>Locally, the NAACP is the triage room for communities in crisis. Whether it&rsquo;s helping to unionize 5,000 workers at the world&rsquo;s largest pork processing plant in North Carolina last December; offering Muslim prisoners who, because of recent legal action by the NAACP in Oregon, the right to wear Muslim clothing and have their religion respected; registering hundreds of mostly white prisoners in Maine to vote; fighting school closings in low income neighborhoods in Seattle; or suing the Department of Housing and Urban Development for allowing the Mississippi governor to divert money designated for Katrina victims  &mdash;  the NAACP is here now, as it has been for a century, to redress the injustices and right the wrongs.</p>

<p>Absolutely not.  Every complaint the had in the last 20 years has been out and out lies, just as they are now.</p>
<p>How can they explain their inability to learn, advance or achieve, if they can&rsquo;t blame whitey for their incompetence?</p>

<p>Maybe those white employers have just had too many bitter real world experiences when they hired &#8220;qualified&#8221; blacks.  I work in a technical field where there are lots of Chinese and Indians, as well as whites, but hardly any blacks.  In my three decades of experience I have worked with only two of them.  They were educated and middle class in outlook and behavior.  No doubt they are what the New Republic would insist upon labeling as &#8220;qualified&#8221;.  After all, they have the appropriate pieces of paper.  But they were both of rather marginal competence, and both ultimately had to be let go.</p>
<p>My sister was a manager at an engineering firm.  She lives in a very white part of the country so of course has liberal views about race, as nearly everything she knows about blacks is what she hears on National Public Radio and sees on TV (where blacks are all police chiefs, neurosurgeons, or directors of government laboratories).  She had just one direct interaction with a black engineer, and was less than impressed with his work.  But of course he had the right pieces of paper, so was &#8220;qualified&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t doubt that some black engineers, scientists, managers, and the like really do know their stuff and can do a good job.  But I think we should let employers decide who is competent, not politicians, judges, liberal arts majors writing for subsidized magazines, and self appointed civil rights activists.</p>

As long as there&rsquo;s money and power connected to claims of &#8216;racial injustice&rsquo;, the hucksters will be standing on their soap boxes.</p>

<p>Tragically, the NAACP WAS listened to. When blacks with awful credit were justifiably refused loans, the NAACP called it &#8220;redlining&#8221; and so  the gov&rsquo;t pressured banks into giving undeserving blacks and hispanics subprime loans.</p>
<p>Now that these loans have tanked the NAACP is suing the very same banks they forced to issue the bad loans for &#8220;predatory lending&#8221;!</p>
<p>Absolutely despicable. </p>

<p>Oh can i relate. I have an online friend of mine whom i talk to on a semi-daily basis. Its come to my attention their oft-liberal views. I happened to know where the general area of where they live is, so i looked it up online complete with racial break down.</p>
<p>95% White.</p>
<p>I laughed as soon as i saw the statistic. Indeed, it seems a penchant for liberal views on race is directly and inversely related to the volume of blacks in the actual area. As the volume rises, reality settles in. I guess i cant blame her for her misguided view on reality. All she has seen is the &#8220;black heroes&#8221; of TV and movies, and the rare black here and there in her community. She must have little to no experience with non-whites in general with such a densely white area.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Wish i lived there actually. </p>

Not if the drive-by media can help it!  Heaven forbid that they should have to actually check facts and do research.</p>

			<p>Just look at the two people that wrote this story, they are some of the most racist blacks in the country, Julian Bond is a white people hater from way back.</p>
<p>This story is totally biased, the NAACP, ACORN, and other black activist groups with the democratic party are the ones that caused this economic mess.</p>

<p>Correct &hellip; That&rsquo;s why conservative politicians can win in states like SC, GA, LA, and MS.</p>

			<p>A clue into the unemployment problem for all races can be found in the US corporate tax system, which has the highest rates in the world.  The money the government extorts from businesses as taxes is money these businesses can&rsquo;t spend training additional employees and buying better plant equipment to make their workers more productive (do you wonder why companies either offshore operations or else hire H-1bs or illegal aliens?  They&rsquo;re eager to save money.)  The nonsensical idea that we could somehow tax ourselves into prosperity has gotten us where we are, but the height of insanity was the last election, in which the US voting public gave the party that created the problem in the first place even more power.  </p>
<p>It gets worse than that.  The pernicious welfare state, created by Lyndon Johnson guaranteed the rise of the one-parent family by replacing the black male with the white taxpayer as a provider to black women, thereby making him irrelevant.  Predictably, this introduced a whole stew of additional social dysfunctions among successive generations.  Their low IQ and poor impulse control was relatively manageable back when society demanded they attend school, stay somewhat sober, eventually work for a living to support their families and instill some discipline in their children - the way whites and Asians are still expected to behave.</p>
<p>Poverty and drugs are symptoms, not the disease.  Rural white areas sometimes have problems with methamphetamines, but even in these areas, gangs of feral white teenagers are not out committing drive-by shootings late at night (except, it seems, for the occasional road sign).</p>
