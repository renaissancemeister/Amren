<h1>CNO Releases Diversity Podcast</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>U.S. Navy, February 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WASHINGTON (NNS)  &mdash;  The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Gary Roughead released a podcast on the importance of diversity and the Navy&rsquo;s diversity initiatives Feb. 27.</p>
<p>In the podcast, Roughead talks about the strides the Navy has made since he released his new diversity policy in 2008. He emphasized that a diverse population is important because when Sailors and Navy civilians are approached with issues, it provides a range of ideas, perspectives and backgrounds that provide better solutions making the Navy stronger.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the military and in the Navy, it&rsquo;s important that we are a diverse organization because we have to represent what I call the face of America,&#8221; said Roughead. &#8220;As our population changes and the percentages of majority-minority changes and that&rsquo;s always taking place we have to reflect that same demographic in our Navy and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important, but at the end of the day, it really makes a huge difference because we&rsquo;re stronger because of the different perspectives and ideas that people bring to bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNO also said the diversity of the Navy has made great progress in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve expanded our junior ROTC programs, we&rsquo;re expanding our ROTC programs, we&rsquo;re offering scholarship opportunities sooner than we did before so that the young men and women can make an earlier choice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He expressed that it is each individual&rsquo;s responsibility to recruit, develop, educate and retain leaders from and for all parts of the Navy and nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is also about leadership and looking for young men and women with talent and drive and competence and putting them in positions where they can succeed,&#8221; said Roughead.</p>
<p>He stressed the value of a diverse Navy and the success it will bring the young men and women put in positions to lead Sailors in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those positions then enable them to reach higher and go further in the Navy then they would have had they not had a leader who was looking out for them, mentoring them, training them and guiding them along in a career that is the best in the world,&#8221; Roughead said.</p>

			<p>I was in the Navy and can tell you that the diversity the CNO brags about is the very reason why the Navy is a joke. On my ship you would have Puerto Ricans taking over the mess deck and having their little celebrations. Having to deal with blacks that can&rsquo;t recite the alphabet is pretty common as well. As Michael Savage said the other day, a Navy vesel is basically a big brothel.</p>

			<p>Oh, lovely. So if diversity has the same effect on the Navy that it has had on the school-system, on crime-rates, and on bureaucracy and Government, I imagine we will see ships going to the bottom at a rate unseen since Pearl Harbour. I fear, deeply indeed, for my Nation&rsquo;s safety. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of us had the misfortune of seeing Obamas speech to the Marines last week. Framed for the purpose of the TV cameras were five Marines, one of whom was a white male. Another was a black male. One was a white female and two were black females. I&rsquo;m certain that our enemies and potential bad guys took due notice.</p>

Is Adm Roughhead speaking for himself or is he reading from a script?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip; it really makes a huge difference because we&rsquo;re stronger because of the different perspectives and ideas that people bring to bear.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>How much of daily operations or combat situations can be improved with different perspectives? What fresh, new, creative, innovative ideas can a black rapper wanna-be present that will advance military readiness and effectiveness? Have blacks and latinos offered new methods of combat effectiveness? Have blacks and latinos changed naval technology for the better? Have blacks and latinos presented combat strategies that no one has ever thought of before? If so, what are they?</p>
<p>Once again all we get is &#8216;diversity is good&rsquo; but we never get any details as to how the magic actually works.</p>
<p>&#8216;The navy is better because of increasing diversity&rsquo; we&rsquo;re told. I want concrete examples where diversity of individuals has made the navy a better and stronger fighting force.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what this guy is saying is that the navy is now better because there are fewer whites. If this is true, tell me how and why it&rsquo;s true.<br>

			<p>I had a friend join the navy about a year ago. Before he went to training they gave him a manual for new recruits.  In the manuel it states that you can not bring reading material except for your Bible, koran, or other religious texts. Given that Islam has declared war on us, that last statement is dangerous.  Oops CNO forgot to mention the soldiers that died by their fellow soldiers who decided to take the side of their fellow muslims. </p>

			<p>The empire requires warm bodies. The cold war and the war on terror go hand in hand with the racial dispossession of Native Born White America. The US military is on board with the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. </p>
<p>All of you fools who voted for the Republican party because the Republican party is strong on defense voted for the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. Or to put it another way, your war mongering is rapidly bringing about the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans within the borders of America.</p>
<p>The US military and the military industrial complex is the mortal enemy of Native Born White America.</p>
<p>I pray for a massive economic collapse and I pray for a major US military defeat.The Iranians have the capability to sink US aircraft carriers.</p>

			<p>I can imagine that the internet came to a standstill with people downloading this podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is the case now, but it used to be that the Navy was the whitest of all the service branches, because they had intelligence tests.  In other words, during the post WWII to 1973 time period when there was universal military service, if you tested at a high IQ then you could choose the Navy.  I&rsquo;m thinking that they have dismantled a lot of this, because IQ tests have a disparate impact on the stupid.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of the corporate greed monger&rsquo;s parallel in the military.</p>
<p>The greedy, corrupt CEO&rsquo;s want consumers of every stripe and their policy is a concentrated effort to placate blacks any way they can, including squeezing them into jobs they aren&rsquo;t qualified for and giving millions to non-white, anti-white organizations all for the sake of earning more money.</p>
<p>Until the sub-prime meltdown occurred, they were in the process if trying to create a new world order, where workers are interchangeable from country to country, so they had the option of choosing whatever group would work the closest to sweat shop wages.  They also had the advantage already in play where they offshored their businesses in order to save a bit on taxes, without any regard to loyalty to their own country and people.  </p>
<p>And, in several instances they have interjected black incompetents in many jobs, including CEO positions in corporations like Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, and Citi Group, all for the sake of creating a &#8220;diversity&#8221; facade in an effort to divert criticism that blacks don&rsquo;t hold any good positions in the business world, especially CEO&rsquo;s.  Less complaining from the black crybabies and a larger bottom line was possible that way.</p>
<p>And, in every respect, the military is the same way.  There are black generals who are absolute morons and shouldn&rsquo;t be in positions making decisions where they hold people&rsquo;s lives in their incompetent hands.  There are lower echelon officers who can barely read and write leading units that have sergeants who are more capable than they are.</p>
<p>In the corporate instance, we were brought down monetarily by sub-prime diversity mortgages that weren&rsquo;t paid.  In the military instance, we will eventually suffer a catastrophic military defeat, again because of black incompetents who have no more business in military positions of power than they had in homes costing a half million dollars with mortgage payments that were greater than their monthly salaries.</p>
<p>I talked to a wise old farmer in a small town convenience store today, and he said, &#8220;I really believe this economic collapse will get far worse in the next few years, and you know what?  I think it&rsquo;s just exactly what we need?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the words right out of my mouth, because that&rsquo;s exactly what I had intended to say next.</p>
<p>Another salt of the earth fella I spoke with who worked at a feed store mentioned to me that this crash has derailed the plans for a new world order.</p>
<p>Very astute people.  And the big city lefties laugh at them, thinking they&rsquo;re too unsophisticated to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>This is our moment; this is our time&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..beginning now.  It&rsquo;s a nightmare unfolding everyday for the PC bunch who is so naive they&rsquo;re looking for a turn around with a porkulus bill that will obviously accelerate the devastation in the final analysis.</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising in the least. I spent 20 years in the Air Force. Every time we turned around we were attending an equal opportunity class. The base paper was filled constantly with blacks receiving awards. The whites outnumbered the blacks vastly yet received little notice for their efforts. </p>
<p>I had blacks work for me that felt I was a mean boss because I had them show up to work on time. It was frustrating. </p>
<p>Having worked closely with them for years did not bring us closer. It highlighted our differences, and made me realize reconciliation of the races may not be possible.</p>

			<p>As a taxpayer, I am only paying the Navy to do one job. That is to destroy foreign invaders to keep them from landing on our shores. If the enmy does land, the marines take over. I want the best in the navy, regardless of race color or creed. If this means that the crews would be all white-so be it. </p>

			<p> I spent 30 years in the Navy and now work on a Navy base. The Navy is a total mess, the ships can&rsquo;t operate anymore without continual civilian support.<br>
 The sailors spent all their time doing everything but their jobs. I work with officers who who can&rsquo;t read, I kid you not.</p>

			<p>Admiral Roughead claims the US Navy needs to maximize the amount of racial diversity in the US Navy. Try contemplating this:Submarine Commander Mohammad, commander of a submarine loaded with ICM and  a muslim crew. How about a Hindu,hindi speaking crew? Amd throw some sihks into the mix.</p>
<p>The single most important factor in integrating the US military was the Cold War. And from there the rest of the American society. WE had to show the commies our moral superiority. The end result was a masive increase in the raping of Native Born White Women by black men.</p>
<p>Admiral Roughhead is a boldface liar. The Putnam studies makes it clear that post-1965 immigration policy-the single most important generator of diversity-has corrosive effect on social cohesion. Roughhead is a toady for the parties of  treason:the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>
<p>If the US miltary was half its current size, the planet would be a much less dangerous place than it is today. Russia has announced plamns to scale back miltary spending..at at time when the when the US is attemptig to surround Russia with US and US client state military bases. Putin has more sensible priorities such as keeping Russia racially homogenous and using its scarce resource to developement of Russia&rsquo;s youth. </p>
<p>No one said it better than the late General Smedley Butler:&#8221;I was a hit man for the United Fruit company&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill and Hilarly Clinton&rsquo;s murderous assault on the Serbian civilian population was justified-according the neocons who infest the Democratic party-because the Sebians needed to be educated about the blessings of diversity.</p>

			<p>Great posts Jupiter!  To paraphrase something that I read, one of the hallmarks of truth is that it tends to offend.</p>
<p>Does anyone remember the farce of the Star Wars system in the 80s?  The latest proposal for the missile shield is strange in a few ways, the least of which is that a potential nuclear weapon is least likely to be deployed by long range missile from a Muslim state.  Frankly, this is the latest in a long line of projects that transfers wealth from the taxpayers, to industry, back to the politicians via industry lobbyists.</p>

I too applaud Jupiter for telling it like it is. He spares no punches.  Without that fool, Dubya Bush, and the many other fools who voted for him (twice, no less), we wouldn&rsquo;t now have someone like Obama in the White House. Bush was used to pave the way for the situation that we have today. <b> Much of the vote for Obama was simply a reaction to Bush. </b> Without a Bush, an Obama would never have had a chance. </p>
<p>And Jupiter is again absolutely on the mark when he says, <i>&#8220;The single most important factor in integrating the US military was the Cold War   &mdash;   and from there, the rest of American society. WE had to show the commies our moral superiority.&#8221; </i> Exactly!  Our zeal to outdo the communists (in terms of showing off our presumed &#8220;moral superiority&#8221;) was the undoing of traditional America, white America.  We had to outdo them by becoming more Marxist than they.   Now, they don&rsquo;t have Marxism anymore, but we do!</p>

			<p>What a sorry SOB.  I wonder what corporate boards he will be sitting on upon retirement.  Not unlike Stormin Norman the shill for diversity as well and Anthony Zinni and the ever tough and wonderful Hugh Shelton.  Those last three retired generals were the most prominant to sign the Green Brief in the big supreme court  affirmative action cases a few years back. </p>

<p>They Navy has advancement tests that enlisted people have to take to advance from one paygrade to the next but they&rsquo;re a joke.  If the Navy sets a quota for 100 Machinist Mates to be promoted to E-5 and 100 people take the exam they all get promoted.  I retired from the Navy a few years ago from the Naval Air Station in Brunswick. The last 3 years was terrible. I was one of only three White males at my command.  The Equal Opportunity Officer was a supply Chief who was a known lesbian (so much for don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell) who made sure the multicult message was co-opted by the command.  The place if I remember was about 60% minority although all the commissioned officers were White males.  The place was surreal.  Every workcenter had 5x the number of people needed to do the job.  Every colored person&rsquo;s workload was light and it was finished before 11:00am most days.  This is how they made diversity work. As supervisors, we made sure they completed the work and that it was done correctly.  This is your tax dollars at work people.    </p>

<p>Hey genius if America suffers a major defeat and a economic collapse thats it. By the way that would mean hundreds of thousands of whites would die. Also that would be it for the North America in general. After we collapse Mexicans would claim Canada and America as theirs and rob it blind.</p>
<p>We can shut immigration down if we wanted to and had more babies, but that would require some people with a back bone.</p>

<p>Hey, genius, you&rsquo;re irrational again.  If America collapsed do you think there would be much of anything left of other nations, ESPECIALLY MEXICO?  </p>
<p>Drug gangs are in the process of taking over Mexico right this minute.  The knowledge that the US would move on them is about the only thing preventing complete takeover.  If the US suffers an economic collapse and/or a military defeat, Mexico will look like Somalia with drug lords fighting each other for control.</p>
<p>The US is headed for a calamity, as is the whole world.  Wishful thinking won&rsquo;t stop it.</p>

<p>Well, the Air Force used to be very white during my time there, especially in my field. (Hard to believe this month marks the 30th anniversary of my enlistment.) Unfortunately, &#8220;Douglas&#8221; reports that things have deteriorated recently. I never attended an &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; class (nor do I recall anyone else doing so) because standards were the same for everyone across the board. Even the mention of a person&rsquo;s race on his job performance evaluation was strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>As for intelligence tests, I only took the standard ASVAB and AFQT exams that everyone else did.</p>

			<p>To SouthernJew:</p>
<p>Perfect words; excellent post. </p>
<p>Affirmative action is simply the antichrist of excellence. </p>
<p>Pre-deployment work-ups for Iraq involved an amazing amount of cultural sensitivity training, along with an equally shocking amount of EEO training. As an infantryman, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the Marine Corps was actually sending me to Iraq to do. </p>
<p>Defending the country is actually based on individual Marines, sailors, airmen, and soldiers defending one another. In combat arms this means killing the enemy; in non-combat occupational fields this means demanding excellence in your specialty so that the enemy can be killed. </p>
<p>No matter the MOS, being a professional warrior demands more from the individual than just their 8-hour working day. In the infantry it means literally giving of your body and soul. On a flight line it might mean 20-hour shifts. It might mean a Motor-T soldier drives back-to-back-to-back convoys. It might mean any one of a million painful personal sacrifices best performed by the most committed soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine.</p>
<p>Affirmative action virtually ensures that the least committed, least motivated, least qualified, minimum-standards type will fill any given position. Wonderful. </p>

<p>There very likely will be a point of no return as America slides into a hellish dystopia. Hopefully, Native Born White Americans will wake up early enough on the downward slide to reclaim the Nation they created.<br>
It will take the destruction  of a certain number of Native Born White American lives before the message that&hellip; business as usual=DEATH&hellip; sinks in. What this number is, I do not know.</p>
<p>I believe that it is going to very very bad-very close to the brink.</p>
<p>Suppose 1)Native Born White fertility increases and 2)suppose amnesty passess. If this happens, the US population will high probability hit the one billion mark in less then twenty years. </p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans want to increase their fertility level and at the same time prevent an ecological catastrophe that would bring about the collapse of the Native Born White population, millions of high fertility post-1965 non-whites would have to be removed from America. The situation may be far worse than anybody realizes. </p>

			<p>     You all know what needs to be done. Are you up for it is the<br>
only question. People who faint at sight of blood wont be any<br>
use to us or themselves. It&rsquo;s not a time for sophisticates at<br>
all-they&rsquo;re going to die. Fellow barbarians, our time is almost<br>
here. As the great American Martyr (he was assasinated) Patton<br>
said, let the enemy die for his country, you are going to live<br>
for your&rsquo;s. Anyone up for that-killing the enemy so that our<br>
people can Live?</p>
