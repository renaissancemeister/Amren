<h1><a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/more-proof-that-intelligence-is-85134.aspx">Study Gives More Proof That Intelligence Is Largely Inherited</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Wheeler, UCLA Newsroom, March 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience Feb. 18, UCLA neurology professor Paul Thompson and colleagues used a new type of brain-imaging scanner to show that intelligence is strongly influenced by the quality of the brain&rsquo;s axons, or wiring that sends signals throughout the brain. The faster the signaling, the faster the brain processes information. And since the integrity of the brain&rsquo;s wiring is influenced by genes, the genes we inherit play a far greater role in intelligence than was previously thought.</p>
<p>Genes appear to influence intelligence by determining how well nerve axons are encased in myelin  &mdash;  the fatty sheath of &#8220;insulation&#8221; that coats our axons and allows for fast signaling bursts in our brains. The thicker the myelin, the faster the nerve impulses.</p>
<p>Thompson and his colleagues scanned the brains of 23 sets of identical twins and 23 sets of fraternal twins. Since identical twins share the same genes while fraternal twins share about half their genes, the researchers were able to compare each group to show that myelin integrity was determined genetically in many parts of the brain that are key for intelligence. These include the parietal lobes, which are responsible for spatial reasoning, visual processing and logic, and the corpus callosum, which pulls together information from both sides of the body.</p>
<p>The researchers used a faster version of a type of scanner called a HARDI (high-angular resolution diffusion imaging). {snip} HARDI tracks how water diffuses through the brain&rsquo;s white matter  &mdash;  a way to measure the quality of its myelin.</p>
<p>&#8220;HARDI measures water diffusion,&#8221; said Thompson, who is also a member of the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro-Imaging. &#8220;If the water diffuses rapidly in a specific direction, it tells us that the brain has very fast connections. If it diffuses more broadly, that&rsquo;s an indication of slower signaling, and lower intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it gives us a picture of one&rsquo;s mental speed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Because the myelination of brain circuits follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory, peaking in middle age and then slowly beginning to decline, Thompson believes identifying the genes that promote high-integrity myelin is critical to forestalling brain diseases like multiple sclerosis and autism, which have been linked to the breakdown of myelin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole point of this research,&#8221; Thompson said, &#8220;is to give us insight into brain diseases.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I predict the study will end here, because if it goes on much further, someone is more likely to discover the racial component to this.</p>

			<p>It certainly isn&rsquo;t any newsflash that intelligence is largely inherited. Numerous studies involving identical and freternal twins and biological and adopted siblings proved long ago that IQ differences between adults was largely genetic. Of course, the radical egalitarians have always been quick to point out that these studies only prove that differences in intelligence between individuals (and not racial groups) is mostly genetic. But to counter that arguement, how would the environment cause  racial groups to have  different IQ &#8216;profiles&rsquo;. For example, east Asians and American Indians both preform higher on IQ tests that measure visual-spacial intellegence, whereas whites and black have roughly the same visual-spacial IQ averages. Surely the common ancestry of Asians and Amerindians must play a role in this observed phenenomon. This study mentioned in this article gives me hope that someday (perhaps soon) we will have irrefutable genetic proof that IQ is largely biologcal and thats it&rsquo;s unevently distrubed amongst the races. I&rsquo;m sure the reaction from the egalitiarins will be a site worth watching if and when this becomes a reality. </p>

			<p>This makes sense the G related areas (higher mental processes) are greatly influenced by genes the monkey see monkey do temporal lobe not so much. The problem is so many people think that intelligence is a function of how much stuff you have memorized. When in fact if is much more about the ability to recognize patterns and process information. I am from California and have seen the neighborhood I used to live in go way downhill (any guess as to why). People who are smart have no way to conceive what life would be like to not be able to figure things out on their own. Most black people have one learned response for each particular situation if that does not work they are dumbstruck and completely unable to figure out their own solution. That is why they will keep doing the same things over and over again until the end of time. That is why they are so dramaticaly underrepresented in the annals of science and invention. They just don&rsquo;t have it in them and, no amount of education can give them the spark to progress. In short they can learn but can&rsquo;t adapt or create that is why they will always fail.</p>

			<p>Enlightened is not correct. East Asians on average do perform higher than whites on visuo-spatial tests. Whites on average outperform East Asians on verbal / analytical tests. But blacks do not have the same visuospatial average as whites. Their average on visuo-spatial scores is about 13 points below whites and even farther behind on verbal/analytical. On an interesting side note, whites are the only racial group found (so far) to usually average about the same on, regardless of IQ, visuo-spatial and verbal / analytical tests, while most non-whites are skewed toward having the visuo-spatial portions of the tests as their strong points. Of course there are some &#8220;sub-groups&#8221; within whites who differ from this, for example Ashkenazi Jews who tend to score high on verbal portions of tests but a bit below average on visuo-spatial types of questions. </p>

			<p>Huh?  Does this &#8220;study&#8221; seriously imply than anybody not living on a remote Pacific island believes that genes and intelligence are not closely correlated?</p>
<p>This has been known to all rational observers for untold millenia, whether the question was related to humans, dogs, or monkeys.</p>
<p>That someone would pretend to be surprised by these data merely illustrates how true science has been utterly perverted by so-called social &#8220;science.&#8221;</p>

			<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>Fortunately, this research falls into a class that is relatively protected from political interference. Consider the quote: <i>&#8220;The whole point of this research,&#8221; Thompson said, &#8220;is to give us insight into brain diseases.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Since it is hard science that relates to diseases, rather than just the study of IQ, it will avoid censorship by the Thought Police. Neuroscience is established and is making rapid progress.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s PC talk, since we also read that </p>
<p>&#8220;myelin integrity was determined genetically in many parts of the brain that are key for intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are trying to maintain the firewall betwen science and the public, and with it the fiction of racial equality in IQ.<br>

			<p>Utah 6.53 PM March 19. Not altogether true. In USA and UK they havn&rsquo;t failed. In fact they have obviously grasped that they need to do nothing at all to live quite well as White people will always provide. They don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s called welfare as they have no sense of shame. In fact, if they do work, they are laughed at by others of their race. In africa, they would be scratting around just to subsist but it wouldn&rsquo;t bother them as as this is to be expected and is the norm. This story does not mention the race of the subjects which is quite telling. I must check further just in case! My curiosity is now aroused. </p>
