<h1>Chicago Settles Reverse Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After years of legal wrangling, 75 white firefighters will share a $6 million settlement reached with the city of Chicago in a reverse discrimination lawsuit filed over a 1986 lieutenants&rsquo; exam.</p>
<p>Concerned the exam discriminated against black firefighters, the city &#8220;race normed&#8221; the test&rsquo;s results. A jury later found the test was fair, a decision the U.S. Supreme Court upheld on appeal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Firefighters&rsquo; attorney Linda Friedman said a group of 100 other white firefighters previously received tens of millions of dollars and benefits in a separate settlement in the same lawsuit.</p>

			<p>This is exactly what happened in New Haven, CT. Lets hope the same result happens in the New Haven CT case in April when the Supreme Court hears the case. The liberally biased Supreme Court in CT ruled in favor of racial discrimination which is no surprise. Hopefully the US Supreme Court can set them straight.</p>

			<p>Of course I agree they were discriminated against, but who in their right mind would want to be a Chicago firefighter?  You&rsquo;re 10 times busier than you would be if you were in the suburbs, and you&rsquo;re surrounded by a white-hating city government and angry bigoted black residents.</p>
<p>Last year, a paramedic crew en route to a hospital after picking someone up was shot at in East St. Louis by one of the city&rsquo;s many worthies:</p>

			<p>The PBS  agitators keep claiming that &#8220;race&#8221; is a purely social construct, but this did not discourage Chicago &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; from administrating <i>&ldquo;race normed&rdquo;</i> tests.</p>
<p>When blacks suffered from racial discrimination, at least they were taking <i>some</i> advantages of living in a country built from scratch by someone else (whites, that is). But what do the whites that are being discriminating against get for their suffering? A privilege for paying for the majority of blacks&rsquo; failure or reluctance to subsist themselves?<br>

			<p>I wish people would stop using the term &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221;.  It implies that it is whites who normally practice discrimination and, as such, it is a racist term.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely amazing that black whiners are catered to so greatly.  I mean, if they had to come up with an answer to a test like, what color was George Washington&rsquo;s white horse, or a multiple choice for something like 2 plus 2 equals: a.4 b.150 or c. 99, and they got both answers wrong, then they&rsquo;d start crying about a taint of racism on the test.</p>
<p>My disgust for these cry babies couldn&rsquo;t be any lower, and any kind of respect at all is nonexistent.</p>

<p>So go and sue Chicagmalia again.</p>

			<p>All good and well. BUT!!! It took 23 years for these whites to receive justice? And $6 million divided up amongst 75 whites who were cheated? I&rsquo;ve heard of LARGER awards for ONE black that was ALLEGEDLY slighted. </p>
<p>&#8220;Write&#8221; on JewAmongYou. &#8220;Reverse discrimination&#8221; implies that whites are the real racists and it is a rare event when the reverse happens. Time to end this nonsensical term. The real reverse racism is the rare white on black racist incident. </p>

			<p>Every Legal and Social Victory should be celebrated, even the small ones that took too many years to get justice.  Jewamongyou is correct, does sound like White Males are usually guilty of discrimination.  I&rsquo;ll just call it Racial Discrimination.</p>

<p>So how much did lawyer Friedman get out of that?  </p>
<p>And they had to wait 23 years?!!!  Justice delayed is justice denied.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet some of those firefighters are no longer even living.  How do you compensate THEM?<br>

<p>I agree. It should be banished. It&rsquo;s a left-wing propaganda term. It&rsquo;s automatically skewed against whites. The assumption it carries it that it is an exception to the general rule, merely a bizarre situation.</p>
<p>In point of fact, it IS the rule. Why do we tolerate it? </p>

			<p>I looked into these claims that certain tests are culturally biased against blacks. Come to find out we have been pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the process of devising a test where blacks do as well as whites. There is no such test and the ramifications are plain   &mdash;   the less cultural content in an intelligence test the worse blacks do! They use cultural references to help them guess at the correct answers. IN FACT, BLACKS DO MUCH WORSE ON CULTURAL-NEUTRAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS MATH! </p>
<p>HOW CAN A MATH PROBLEM BE RACIST???</p>
