<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Altaf Qadeer teaches at Brookview Middle School, in the north end of the city. Brookview is a hive of scholastic innovation; Altaf teaches language, math and social studies.</p>
<p>He came here from Pakistan 20 years or so ago, and therefore he is one of the happy exceptions  &mdash;  he was trained as a teacher in Pakistan, and he is working here in his profession.</p>
<p>We met the other day at that Canadian Experience conference. I attended out of curiosity. He was there because he knows the problems new Canadians face, and so he got involved in the planning of the conference.</p>
<p>Altaf also has a nifty idea.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;During the planning of the conference, one of our colleagues had just been in a taxi, and the taxi driver was talking about semiotics; they had a very impressive conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;My colleague asked how it was that the driver knew so much. The driver said he had a PhD in semiotics, and he was driving a cab because he couldn&rsquo;t work in a Canadian university, because of the language barrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Altaf, the penny dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started thinking there should be some way to use that talent. We bring a lot of immigrants who are very talented. Perhaps, if our universities had some flexibility it would be useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Useful, how?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m saying that highly educated people might come into our universities, perhaps as guest lecturers, to get some experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aha.</p>
<p>&#8220;There could be a satellite campus or something Internet-based, so people could teach in their first language.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sort of like the Learning Annex, but with multilingual breadth and intellectual depth. You see how an agile mind works?</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;There could be courses for Canadians who want to learn in Hindi, or there could be courses for people back home who want to study with someone who is already here; we could link with universities in other countries and do some collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Win-win.</p>
<p>Altaf led a little study session at the conference, and he threw this idea up for discussion.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;For example, there was a Russian couple with a background in literature, and a lady from Egypt who had a background in arts education in Arabic.&#8221;</p>
<p>You begin to get the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is in a very nascent stage. We did not have a thorough discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t enough time. But conjure with him for a moment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it could involve study over the Internet; if we opened a virtual university, people who were aiming to come to Canada would have a better chance when they got here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the notion of virtual university  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t have a university education, real or virtual  &mdash;  but I do know there are all sorts of community centres all over town where lectures might be given and where classes might be held.</p>
<p>Altaf was getting warmed up as his coffee cooled. He said, &#8220;I have a friend, a composer who is thinking about transcribing &#8216;O Canada&rsquo; for traditional South Asian instruments; I haven&rsquo;t asked him, but he is the kind of person who might offer courses. His languages are Urdu and Hindi.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I know a famous Urdu poet. There could be all kinds of cultural studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I have colleagues who speak Farsi, they can teach in that language.</p>
<p>&#8220;There could be many courses in various languages, at an advanced level, for people who want cultural studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s it going to take to pull this off?</p>
<p>Altaf said, &#8220;We need a meeting of stakeholders, academics, community leaders, the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I find the possibilities breathtaking.<br>

		<p>  Don&rsquo;t these people have any idea how stupid they sound? «Transcribing the «kanadian» national anthem for traditional South Asian instruments,  .  .» (!). </p>
<p> Further to the matter of the transformation of the «kanadian» Ivory Tower into the modern (or, post - modern), «Tower of Babel,» it is now possible, at least at l&rsquo;université de Sherbrooke - a wretched little pretentious university, «tucked away» in Québec&rsquo;s Eastern Townships,  to have one&rsquo;s diploma printed in one&rsquo;s native language. Sherbrooke, despite it&rsquo;s size, is the home of an not inconsiderable population of hispanics - «Rafael» for example,  works the express checkout at one of the local foodstores.  Spanish will, one must assume, be one of the languages in which Sherbrooke diplomas shall henceforth be redacted. </p>
<p>  There is also an transient student population of Tunisians and Moroccans, some «right off the plane» from «al maghreb;» some «on - migrants from Montréal. Arabic, or, at least, the variants of this language spoken along the North African shore, shall probably also be another language in which diplomas awarded at l&rsquo;université de sherbrooke shall be transcribed. </p>
<p> There is also, apparently, an bureau, within the general university secretariat, which exists exclusively to process such requests.</p>

		<p>As usual, the left creates a problem and then offer a solution.  If Canada had no Iranians or Pakistanis, there&rsquo;d be no use whatsoever for instruction in those languages.</p>

		<p>I fully agree. If Canadians (their government officials) had the collective brains to lock out the damned third-world foreigners, there would be little or no need for exotic language skills. It might be blasphemous (at least to liberals) to say this, but third-world immigrants never seem to be able to contribute anything of value to the host country. Bringing, instead, an insatiable appetite for handouts and give-aways from the White population.</p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;There could be courses for Canadians who want to learn in Hindi&hellip;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a much better idea: how about Hindus learning English prior to immigrating to Canada? I don&rsquo;t know of any Canadians who would want to learn Hindi anyway.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We need a meeting of stakeholders, academics, community leaders, the public.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As most AmRen readers and contributors know this is multicult speak for &#8220;we need tax dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I find the possibilities breathtaking.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, period! I despair of your ignorance. How can a white Canadian of Italian heritage sit and listen to an immigrant&rsquo;s obvious plans for destroying or at least replacing white culture in Canada, and then comment that the possibilities are breathtaking? Personally, I find the possibilities nauseating and pathetic.</p>
