<h1>Instant Family</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adriana Barton, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barely a month has passed since Mekfira and Kalkidan made the long journey to West Kelowna, B.C., from Ethiopia, and already the two seven-year-old girls have settled into a routine. Each day they splash in the local swimming pool or play in the snow. And each night before bed, they well up with tears as their adoptive parents, Brent and Laura Livingstone, try to soothe their raw grief.</p>
<p>In their short, turbulent lives, Mekfira and Kalkidan have lost their birth parents, their orphan community and their homeland. But the children can rely on one constant from their former lives: each other.</p>
<p>The girls prattle away in their native language, Amharic, dress their dolls together and fight like sisters do. Although they are cousins, they were raised as siblings in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Livingstones, in their mid-20s, chose adoption over having biological children after they saw orphans in foreign countries who wanted parents desperately. They started with an African-American brother and sister from Florida, adopted as newborns. But they had wanted to adopt older siblings from Ethiopia &#8220;because there&rsquo;s a need for that,&#8221; Mr. Livingstone says. &#8220;And siblings can be a very strong support network for one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the frontiers of international adoption, families who adopt siblings are less rare than they used to be. Although the number of sibling adoptions remains small in Canada, according to adoption agencies, it is part of a broader trend. In the past three years, adoption programs in countries such as Ethiopia, Colombia and Haiti have begun to recognize the importance of the sibling bond, and some parents are returning to North America with two, three or even four brothers and sisters  &mdash;  a full brood at once.</p>
<p>The phenomenon reflects the scarcity of infants from overseas and humanitarian issues involved in adopting them.</p>
<p>International adoption has become an ethical minefield, rife with scandals such as last month&rsquo;s report of children in India being stolen and sold for adoption to rich countries.</p>
<p>As countries such as China tighten their programs to discourage corruption, the waiting time for infants has stretched into several years or more. As a result, many Canadians are extending the upper age limit in their requests, to shorten the waiting period and make sure they&rsquo;re adopting true orphans, agencies report.</p>
<p>In developing countries, older orphans are often part of sibling groups whose communities are too poor to feed them, according to Sandra Scarth, president of the Adoption Council of Canada. And because orphaned siblings are less in demand than infants, they are also less likely to be victims of child trafficking, she says. &#8220;A lot of those children have been in the orphanages for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Canadians with adequate financial and emotional resources, adopting older siblings from a country with a reputable program, such as Ethiopia, may be among the most ethical forms of international adoption, Ms. Scarth says.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is emerging as a preferred source country for siblings because of its well-run orphanages, low rates of health disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome compared with Canada, and the number of children orphaned because of poverty and AIDS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The need for parents in Ethiopia is quite beyond anything people could fathom in North America,&#8221; says Arnica Rowan of Kelowna, B.C. She and her husband, Jason, are in the process of adopting three-year-old Ethiopian twins, whom they hope to bring to Canada by June.</p>
<p>The Rowans requested siblings in part because international adoption programs are unstable, Ms. Rowan says. &#8220;If you adopt a single child at a time, you always have the risk that the country will be closed [to adoption],&#8221; she says, &#8220;and you won&rsquo;t be able to adopt other children who are of the same heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to their heritage, the twin girls may also share a history of trauma and emotional scars  &mdash;  a reality the couple considered when they chose to adopt older children. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t take that decision lightly,&#8221; Ms. Rowan says.</p>
<p>Because adoption can be a difficult and expensive process, sibling adoption may offer parents a faster way to build a family, Ms. Scarth says. &#8220;But the benefit is mainly for the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sibling relationship is a lifelong bond, she points out, and siblings give each other the security and intimacy of having a family member as they settle into their adoptive homes.</p>
<p>The hope of easing an adopted child&rsquo;s loneliness and distress was the reason Debbie and Rod Kurtz of Edmonton decided to adopt sisters from Ethiopia instead of a single child.</p>
<p>After having four boys biologically, Ms. Kurtz says, the couple wanted to add girls to their family. They considered adopting Canadian foster children, but &#8220;the red tape [in Canada] is just astronomical,&#8221; Ms. Kurtz says, and domestic adoption is full of uncertainties. With international adoption, &#8220;we knew that we&rsquo;d be able to find siblings,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and we knew that we&rsquo;d be able to find girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their daughters, Denaye and Maya, came to Canada in September, 2007. At first Denaye, then 3, was &#8220;very clingy&#8221; to five-year-old Maya, Ms. Kurtz recalls. And Maya behaved more like a mother than a child; she would feed her younger sister and even lie to protect Denaye if the younger girl did something wrong.</p>
<p>But the children bonded quickly with their new brothers and learned to rely on their adoptive parents, Ms. Kurtz says. Now, she adds, &#8220;Maya is enjoying being a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>In West Kelowna, Mekfira and Kalkidan are still adjusting to their new lives. Nevertheless, the girls already show signs of thriving, Ms. Livingstone says. They reach out to their new parents for affection and support, and they dote on their younger siblings. Within days, she says, &#8220;it looked like they&rsquo;d all been together forever.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Is it just me, or does it seem like the latest fad for white couples to adopt black children?  Like they&rsquo;re trying to show off how &#8220;enlightened&#8221; and &#8220;diverse and inclusive&#8221; they are.</p>

			<p>You will always hear the heart rending stories of these adoptions but you will never hear the aftermath as these children turn out to be quite different than what the adoptive parents expected. The parents will be burdened with grief and sadness when their &#8220;children&#8221; are arrested for assault, succumb to drug addiction, and have teen age children of their own. <br>
Many &#8220;adoptive&#8221; parents will never tell you the horror stories that they went through when their children did not recognize them as family and instead associated with a part of society that was completely alien and hostile to white people in general.</p>

			<p>Dear Lord. This makes me ill. Miscegenation isn&rsquo;t enough now they target Whites the world over to adopt nonwhite children! I see it all the time, even with White couples who already have their own White children! A &#8220;blended&#8221; family. The Catholic and Protestant Churches are the biggest promoters of interracial adoptions and I for one, am sick of it. Listen to Bott Christian radio (Focus On The Family) sometime and how they glorify and encourage Whites to adopt African and other 3rd world babies! Nary a word about White children the world over who are in desperate need.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable that these two imbeciles don&rsquo;t want to have children of their own.  This is just complete and total racial suicide.  You can&rsquo;t get any more lemming-like than these two.  They&rsquo;re sacrificing their own future to advance other races.  This is a blatant example of self-hate, the self-hate that anti-White forces has brain-washed many White people into having.  In the end these people are going to be severely disillusioned when they get to be older and CANNOT any longer have children of their own and these adopted &#8220;children of color&#8221; reject these two nincompoops and embrace their people, people of their own color.</p>

			<p>But they had wanted to adopt older siblings from Ethiopia &ldquo;because there&rsquo;s a need for that,&rdquo; Brent Livingstone says.</p>
<p>Their will always be surplus children in Africa in need.  Over-breeding is the preferred method of genetic competition in that part of the world.  Adopting children from Africa for altruistic reasons is futile, because it just creates room for more.</p>
<p>I hope to be around to see Brent Livingstone&rsquo;s reaction when the grandchildren start arriving in about ten years.</p>

			<p>An alternative to adopting children from Ethiopia would have been for Brent and Laura to move there, and they could have adopted all the orphans they could handle.</p>
<p>Instead, they expect this country and society to share the burden, though they never asked us.  </p>
<p>What selfish, destructive, greedy people.</p>

			<p><i>International adoption has become an ethical minefield, rife with scandals such as last month&rsquo;s report of children in India being stolen and sold for adoption to rich countries.</i></p>
<p>This is the reason, apart from any racial issues, that international adoption is just a bad, bad idea.  The combination of money, children and third-world ethics creates a situation which virtually ensures corruption and human trafficking.</p>
<p>And for this family that says there is a &#8220;need,&#8221; well, the more white people that show up in Ethiopia ready to pay big bucks to adopt, the more orphans there will be   &mdash;   guaranteed.  It will make the problem even worse, since it gives women a big financial incentive to abandon their children, resulting in many more children in orphanages.</p>

			<p>My wife and I once flirted with the idea of adoption. We talked to a Caholic agency. We wanted health WHITE children&hellip; they offered us half-breed mulattos. We told them, &#8220;thanks but NO THANKS!&#8221; Never heard any more from them after that. Guess we ruffled some feathers for those fine nuns.</p>

			<p>Very very sad. I could see adoption for couples who could not have biological children no matter what they did but to give up your own flesh and blood children for some third world mishmash is insanity in my book. </p>

			<p>Groan! The Okanagan Valley is (was) an all-white retreat for beleaguered Western Canadians fleeing the multicultural diversity in our major cities. And now this! Couldn&rsquo;t they have just fooled around a bit and had white kids of their own? Or if they weren&rsquo;t up to doing that, why not just get some dogs? Even a full-grown pit bull will be a tame puppy in comparison to the African ne&rsquo;er-do-wells they&rsquo;re trying to raise.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian and I firmly believe that white children should be placed with white families, black children with black families.  Otherwise there is going to be conflict and confusion.  Race goes beyond skin color.</p>
<p>Problem is these people promote &#8220;feel-good&#8221; Christianity.  They guilt-trip Christians and do all sorts of twisting and wresting.  Someone who knows the Bible, knows that God created the races for a reason.</p>

			<p>I remember reading a NYT article on how transracial adoption is supposedly harmful to the kids involved. White couples adopting Black orphans somehow harms their self-esteem. </p>
<p>More likely the liberals printing their screed didn&rsquo;t want upper class White people finding out. They(NYT and others) all know it, they just don&rsquo;t want others to.</p>

			<p>I remember seeing pictures of one white couple going to Africa to pick up their newly adopted &#8220;child.&#8221; The white couple showed their naivety and idealism on their faces. The sister/aunt/whoever giving up the child for adoption didn&rsquo;t look sad or happy. Her look was one of &#8220;finally I can get rid of this damn child!&#8221; The woman was a relative, and didn&rsquo;t care that she was giving up a relative. She seemed more than happy to be rid of it.</p>
<p>Many African countries don&rsquo;t let native Africans adopt african children, because the natives molest them or use them for slaves.</p>
<p>Because nurture still matters, these children will grow up to be better human beings than they would have in Africa, but they will still grow up far worse than the Livingstones expect. Doubtless they&rsquo;ll be disappointed in at least one, but probably in several. They&rsquo;re just brainwashed idiots.</p>

			<p>It is likely that this white couple will live to regret this decision.  Many of us know people who have adopted.  Even if the child is of the same race as the parents, the parents often have immense problems with the child, especially after the child learns that he/she is adopted.  Such problems are multiplied with &#8220;transracial&#8221; adoptions. These children know immediately that the adoptive parents are not their real parents.  Studies adopted children  who are not the same race as their parents are more likely to experienced depressions, drug abuse, alcoholism, suicide attempts etc.</p>

<p>This is the problem with Christianity - this absurd urge to &#8216;do good&rsquo;. However in the case of those two fools it&rsquo;s all about them. They&rsquo;ll probably end up on Oprah. They have not thought for one second what they&rsquo;ll be like when they grow&hellip;up.</p>
<p>White people should totally cease to care about aliens, that is, everyone else and start caring only for their own kind -like every other racial/ethnic group on Earth does. <br>
Speaking personally I would be completely unable to establish any kind of &#8216;cultural rapport&rsquo; (if you will) with any African, so why the hell would middle-class whites adopt a brood of them?</p>

 I believe that the book &#8220;Camp of The Saints&#8221; starts out with the collapse of the Western Worlds mail system due to the billions of  pleading letters  from charities and parents of third world children flooding the mailboxes. It was a good foretaste of what was coming later in the book&hellip;</p>

<p>This is hitting the nail on the head.  Every time I see a white couple with black children they are always looking around to make sure people are seeing them, always checking for anyone who may not approve, so they can hold their noses in the air and show how much better and &#8220;right minded&#8221; they are compared to everyone else. </p>
<p>This is what a lifetime of MSM brainwashing looks like.  It will be hilarious when these kids grow up and end up just like any other black person.</p>

			<p>Hey Fed Up; </p>
<p>    You hit the nail on the head. My brother and his wife just adopted a boy from Russia a couple of years ago after 10+ years of trying to adopt (a white child) and blowing 100K on the process. I don&rsquo;t agree with &#8220;doing good for the sake of doing good&#8221;, this is a very misguided sense of Christianity. If you can have kids, have them. It&rsquo;s not going to take long before Mekfira and Kalkidan turn into Shaniqua and LaTowanda and start adopting a bunch of bad habits. I can see adopting a child from China, even though they are not white, they will usually be intelligent enough to succeed in the culture. I know a man who has three children and wanted a fourth. Both he and his wife were nearing 40, a childbirth could have been catastrophic for the wife due to some underlying issues and the children were starting to reach teenage years. This was his best option. </p>
<p>Believe me, I can understand the frustration of people trying to adopt healthy white children. My brother and his wife first tried through the local (county government) adoption agency. Whatever bureaucrat showed up at his door demanded that he relinquish his concealed carry permit and sell all firearms before she would process his application. He told her to pack sand. Then through a private adoption agency which screwed up some paperwork and he was denied a second visa to travel overseas by the state department (just after 9/11). There went 50K right there. Other agencies would roll out the red carpet for mulatto&rsquo;s, cripples, AIDS and crack babies, etc. A healthy white child is a 5 year wait. There were some more screw-ups. Finally after several attempts, they were able to make the requisite trips, convince the civil court justice in Moscow, Russia, and whatever else they needed to do, they brought home a 3 y.o. son.  </p>

			<p>Then you hear whining about how black kids don&rsquo;t get adopted, everyone wants white children.</p>
<p>Seems to me there are still white people out there with sense.</p>
<p>I bet if you take away welfare, blacks might stop pumping out children right and left.  Or at least cut back.  They seem to view children as meal tickets.</p>

			<p>This stupidity of <i>Brent &amp; Laura Livingstone</i> in being the first in the neighbourhood to adopt &#8220;designer children&#8221; really illustrates the depth of brainwashing that has inculcated our lives. These are the types of liberal-minded bozos who easily fall prey to the indoctrination that we&rsquo;re fed daily only to discover too late, that we&rsquo;ve been cleverly duped by organizations much higher-up on the food chain than ourselves. </p>
<p>White people are the <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_world%27s_racial_demographics" rel="nofollow">world&rsquo;s minority race</a> and racially out-numbered by more than 10 to 1, yet people of this mind-set could care less, so long as they&rsquo;re able to <i>&#8220;hold their noses in the air and show how much better and &ldquo;right minded&rdquo; they are compared to everyone else&#8221;</i>.</p>
<p>So, I recommend that they spend 14 minutes watching Roy Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4094926727128068265&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">celebrated video</a> on how much difference they made in the world, other than feeling a little less white-guilt over the world&rsquo;s impoverished non-white people.</p>

			<p>I know a couple who adopted asian children.  The asian children are now adults and have little to do with their adopted parents.  I don&rsquo;t think that has anything to do with the couple that I know; they are decent people and it was a huge sacrifice on their part to do what they did.  Instead I attribute the reason they aren&rsquo;t close anymore to race.  These kids figured out very early that they are a different race and wanted to be around their own race.  They all married asians either from here in the US or abroad.  No matter how you raise these kids, whatever their race, they don&rsquo;t relate to whites and it&rsquo;s understanable.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;They all married asians either from here in the US or abroad.&#8221; </p>
<p>But it was the most beneficial case for the preservation of the white race, wasn&rsquo;t it?  There is nothing wrong with marrying someone of the same race.  I am Korean, and if I marry a Korean woman in the future, that does not mean I am disrespecting other races.  I am open to marrying outside my race, and if I ever do marry outside my race, it will not be because I want to prove to the world that I love race-mixing and I am trying to convince the rest of the world to do the same.  That&rsquo;s also why I think the mainstream media and liberal education that constantly pressure young white women to date and/or marry black men or brown men are sick.  Just because a white woman marries within her race, that does not mean she is disrespecting other races.  </p>
<p>(Marriage is one of the smaller concerns on my mind nowadays.  I just try to make the most out of each day I live nowadays.  That keeps me occupied &amp; exhausted more than enuff)</p>
<p>(I believe, if I just try to live hard each day and respect everyone around me, without being too much concerned with dating or marriage, the right lady will come by)</p>
<p>(or at least I hope so)</p>

<p>&#8220;The biggest enemy of the White race is the White race.&#8221;</p>
<p>No.  It is the anti-white liberals.  </p>
<p>As for the white couple who adopted four children from Ethiopia, it does make me wonder what is on their mind.  Just like another poster specified, if they want to help the Ethiopian children, why aren&rsquo;t they just moving to Ethiopia and help as many children as they want?  </p>

			<p>If abortion wasn&rsquo;t encouraged mainly to White women then there would be more White babies to adopt.(Now they are all whining that it is mostly Blacks and Mexicans who have abortions)..I highly doubt those statistics. The reason it is so hard to find a White baby to adopt is that there are so few of them thanks to abortion. Could this be a deliberate attempt by the enemy of our race to &#8220;kill two birds with one stone&#8221;, so to speak?  They knew that Whites (being so pathetically altruistic) would adopt the 3rd world ones if none of their own were available. Then to top it off, they infiltrated the Christian churches to promote this insanity and genocide of our own racial instincts. </p>

			<p>Everything about that &#8220;family photo&#8221; reeks of the absolute sickness infecting only Whites the world over. The &#8220;parents&#8221; smiles just show how that sickness has permeated these fools. How can anyone call that a family? Race is your family and your kindred, not to mention one&rsquo;s progeny as the FF stated. Thank you psuedo-Christianity that has weakened the minds of White Christians today.</p>
