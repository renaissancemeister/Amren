<h1>Vigil Held for Suspected Oakland Cop Killer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terry Collins, AP, March 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the city prepares for a massive public funeral for four police officers slain in the line of duty, dozens took to the streets in a show of support for the man authorities say was their killer.</p>
<p>Organized by International People&rsquo;s Democratic Uhuru Movement, the march Wednesday evening took participants near a police substation within sight of the two locations where Lovelle Mixon allegedly shot the veteran officers before being slain himself.</p>
<p>Loved ones and supporters walked through the streets chanting, &#8220;OPD you can&rsquo;t hide, we charge you with genocide!&#8221; There were no officers patrolling the march route.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t condone what he did, but it&rsquo;s bringing to light the frustrations between the community and the police,&#8221; said Uhuru Movement member Kihad Deen. &#8220;This gives people a chance to speak their minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mixon&rsquo;s cousin, Dolores Darnell, 26, addressed the small crowd, calling him &#8220;a true hero, a soldier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the real Lovelle,&#8221; she said, holding a picture of a smiling Mixon with his wife. &#8220;We do apologize for what he did to the officers&rsquo; families. But he&rsquo;s not a monster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Authorities say a day before the shooting the 26-year-old fugitive parolee was linked by DNA to the February rape of a 12-year-old girl who was dragged off the street at gunpoint.</p>
<p>The event took place a day after a city-sponsored gathering drew about 1,000 people to the crime scene to honor the slain officers: Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40; John Hege, 41; Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43; and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35.</p>

			<p>Oh, yes.  It must have been an exciting and safe gathering of doctors, chemists, pilots, and rocket scientists.  If only the white cops could legally refuse to police these thugs&rsquo; neighborhood, it would only be a matter of time before there would be no one left to police.  A win-win for taxpayers (read: white taxpayers).</p>
<p>Some blacks truly don&rsquo;t know what a monster is because they&rsquo;ve been around them all their lives and they think they&rsquo;re normal.<br>

			<p>Mixon&rsquo;s cousin, Dolores Darnell, called him &ldquo;a true hero, a soldier.&rdquo;  &ldquo;This is the real Lovelle,&rdquo; holding a picture of a smiling Mixon with his wife.  &#8220;He&rsquo;s not a monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>A large group of blacks actually held a vigil for a multiple cop killing child rapist!</p>
<p>Before Lovelle executed those cops, he was linked via DNA to the rape of a 12 year old girl!  </p>
<p>How could he be anything but a MONSTER?  </p>
<p>It never fails, the MSM always quotes family members of blacks who commit the most horrific crimes describing these thugs in glowing terms&hellip;complete with all the smiling prom pictures, etc.</p>
<p>The MSM fails to mention that this thug fired bullets into the heads of two of the cops AFTER shooting them.</p>
<p>The MSM also fails to mention that this thug got out of prison early for a violent carjacking where he shot at the victim  never should have been out of prison in the first place.</p>
<p>There are millions of blacks who share this sick mindset. </p>
<p>Even more sickening is how all the infantile,  white liberals will refuse to be outraged by this.</p>
<p>It would have been interesting for him to go back to prison.  The same inmates who would commend him for killing four cops would not feel the same way upon finding out he raped a 12 year old girl. </p>
<p>I hope this does not inspire more copycat scenarios, because we have absolutely millions of violent thugs out there easily capable of repeating this to avoid a prison sentence. </p>

			<p>Dolores Darnell should be allowed to take her cousin&rsquo;s place on the gurney. In fairness, three Mixon relatives should be culled to even up the body counts since the demented Uhuru Movement admits Mixon was conducting a race war against whitey.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s see here&hellip;Raping a 12 year old girl and murdering 4 police officers doesn&rsquo;t make you a monster?  This isn&rsquo;t Africa.  We value human life in our country&hellip;or at least I thought we did.</p>
<p>The way this story is playing out is making me sick.  I can only imagine the pain and frustration the families feel when they see people marching through the streets in support of a murdering rapist who killed their loved ones.</p>
<p>Has the world gone crazy?  You couldn&rsquo;t find a more digusting person then Lovelle Mixon to support.  </p>
<p>Someone should organize a March in honor of the OPD.   Enough is enough.</p>

<p> &#8220;Frustrations between the community and the police?!&#8221; Yes, how genocidal of the Oakland Police Department to attempt to apprehend career criminals who rape children! The very idea! </p>

<p>If he just snapped and killed the cops I might believe her, but he apparently raped a 12 year old girl.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s recap.  Lovelle Mixon:</p>
<p>1) Murdered four (4!) Oakland policemen in a matter of hours.<br>
2) Was a rapist (probably a serial rapist, once all the evidence is in) who dragged a 12 year old girl at gunpoint to an isolated area to rape her (his M.O. seems to be brutal rape and sodomy of adolescent girls, based on the news reports I&rsquo;ve read so far).<br>
3) Was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, apparently for acts committed during an armed robbery.</p>
<p>Did I miss anything?  Nope, definitely &#8220;not a monster.&#8221;  No way!</p>
<p>Would a white man with a similar history get ONE white person to march and chant slogans in his name?  Marriage proposals, maybe, but people willing to show their faces in public?  That&rsquo;s my point; only the black community has values consistent with community members feeling they can get away with marching for such a man.  No other racial community would brush off such behavior.</p>

			<p>You just had to see this coward O&rsquo;Reilly tonight on his show covering this. He with a sraight face claimed that 99% of the African American community deplore demonstrations like this. Something along the lines of the good, hard working, decent folks yada,yada,yada. The female attorney sitting next to him at least had the guts to say Sharpton should come out and deplore this type behavior. He blew right past that and continued to babble about something else. He also claimed that this demonstration, get ready for this, was primarilly anti-American. All this from the guy who is &#8220;Looking Out for You&#8221;.</p>

			<p>O&rsquo;Reilly said tonight that these blacks represent only 1% of the population, because the other 99% don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>It makes a person wonder if he heard a word of Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s speeches, and the thundering applause and gleeful hate whitey cheers, or the dozens of black talking heads on T.V. constantly decry being held down, oppressed and discriminated against by whitey.</p>
<p>There is 1% who probably try to be fair-minded and non-racist, but the other 99% are rabid white-haters to one degree or another.  Those like O&rsquo;Reilly have it backwards.   Those types  are the chief reason why there&rsquo;s so many black haters around today.  They&rsquo;re living in the media world, or the political world, or the academic world, or the Wall Street world, and know absolutely nothing about the real world on main street, USA.</p>
<p>Thank god, this circus is finally coming to an end.  It&rsquo;s way overdue.  Let&rsquo;s start over on a smaller basis.</p>

<p>This above post really says it. I saw some coverage on television and you would think from the way the crowd was acting it was like this was some guy who was on his way from work as a child care worker and on his way to church when the cops opened fire on him.I think we have to keep pushing the so called &#8220;black leadership&#8221; if such exists, to get out there and chill these folks out. What black leader has the guts to do this? Let&rsquo;s see how the television interviewers deal with this one. </p>

<p>In my experience, the &#8220;black leadership&#8221; can be found at the front of any march or protest over or about anything!!</p>

			<p>I also watched O&rsquo;Reilly tonight and almost fell out of my chair when he made those stupid comments. He also has $harpton on his show alot and laughs and jokes with that black racist, even goes out to eat with him! I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s bought him out but- - he no longer is &#8220;looking out for you&#8221;. Sean Hannity is another weak White boy. Next time when you listen to him on the radio, notice how he goes out of his way to be nice to his black callers. Today a BLACK woman called in to say that blacks voted for Obama just because he was black, and what did our &#8220;Great American&#8221; say! He told her &#8220;no, no, no,don&rsquo;t make this a race thing, it was all political, they only voted for him because he&rsquo;s a  Democrat, blacks ALWAYS vote Democrat!&#8221; So I guess that if Obama was the Republican and McCain the Democrat, MCCAIN would&rsquo;ve gotten all the black vote over Obama! Right???? </p>

			<p>Dear AR brethren,</p>
<p>I live in the Bay Area and when I heard about this, I mentioned to another conservative that today was truly the day that the world had completely gone mad.</p>
<p>I situation where an convicted armed robber who rapes a pre-teen and murders four policemen, 2 in cold blood, point-blank and these sub-humans celebrate the man who ended not one, not two, but four white men&rsquo;s lives and wrecked a girl, most likely for life.</p>
<p>If you ever had a doubt about any sterotype, IQ test, Affirmative Action and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt for a tough row to hoe&hellip;it&rsquo;s over for me, 100%.  </p>
<p>This act of sheer disdain for life is enough for me.  I guess I really shouldn&rsquo;t surprised when the Left wears Che Gurvara t-shirts&hellip;they are obsessed with dying and murderous thugs.</p>

<p>These folks are too stupid to realize how stupid this makes them look.</p>
<p>Regarding O&rsquo;Reilly:</p>
<p>&#8220;He with a sraight face claimed that 99% of the African American community deplore demonstrations like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The female attorney sitting next to him at least had the guts to say Sharpton should come out and deplore this type behavior.&#8221;<br>
- Anonymous at 7:28 PM</p>
<p>The female attorney was &#8216;spot on&rsquo;. If it were true that most black folks don&rsquo;t feel this way, Sharpton and Jackson would speak out on it. They don&rsquo;t because it would seriously damage their credibility with the black community. That&rsquo;s only possible if most blacks do, indeed, feel this way.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker - O&rsquo;Reilly again:</p>
<p>&#8220;He also claimed that this demonstration, get ready for this, was primarilly anti-American.&#8221; &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;It makes a person wonder if he heard a word of Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s speeches, and the thundering applause and gleeful hate whitey cheers, or the dozens of black talking heads on T.V. constantly decry being held down, oppressed and discriminated against by whitey.&#8221;<br>
- q</p>
<p>What astounded me about the Jeremiah Wright episode were all the blacks defending Reverend Wright by saying such speech was common in black churches. I was dumb founded to realize how many blacks dislike whites and to the degree that they dislike whites. Its not just white folks but America. Here&rsquo;s a news flash, folks. Most black do not like America. As blacks see it, this is the America that kicked the Indians around and all but wiped out the American Indians and their culture. This is the America that enslaved and oppressed black people for centuries. This is the America run by the hated rich white men. This is the American that won&rsquo;t let blacks succeed. Black&rsquo;s hatred of America is stong and deep.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got a half black as the President. Thank god he was raised by white folks pretty much away from the American black experience. Even so, he has tried to assimilate the American black experience. But I don&rsquo;t think his hatred is as strong or runs as deep as the average &#8216;American&rsquo; black.</p>

			<p>No one in the Bay Area would have known - or cared - about this, had the SF Chronicle not put it front and center on their website.  The Chronicle never misses an opportunity to foment racial strife.  One could see it just as a way of a dying newspaper generating readers and it worked - of the nearly 3000 comments on the story, there&rsquo;s almost unanimous calls for the jailing, deportation, torture and/or murder of these sub-humans.  And even the notoriously ham-fisted censors at the most politically correct paper in the west can hide the frustration held by people of all races towards these pieces of black garbage.  The funeral for the 4 slain officers will be held at Oracle Arena tomorrow - they&rsquo;re expecting a crowd of 18,000+ - but in the brain-dead liberal world of the SF Chronicle, 60 rapist-supporting parasites trumps 18,000 decent people any day.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Loved ones and supporters walked through the streets chanting, &#8216;OPD you can&rsquo;t hide, we charge you with genocide!&rsquo; There were no officers patrolling the march route.</p>
<p>Blacks sure do love their buzzwords, even if they normally get the meaning of the buzzword in question dead wrong. Here of course, the misused buzzword is genocide. The killing of one black child rapist and murderer by the police is not an act of &#8220;genocide,&#8221; it is a public service. Genocide involves the planned or attempted extermination of a selected population; unfortunately, black child rapists and murderers are in no short supply either in California or the USA in general.</p>
<p>Hardly what I would call a &#8220;genocide.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The Uhuru movement was mentioned in the previous day&rsquo;s Oakland article, and it made a passing remark about &#8220;bad relations&#8221; between Oakland residents (i.e. black) and the OPD (i.e. white).  I wanted to comment on it here as the article is almost entirely about the Uhurus.</p>
<p>Question:  Why are we to assume that &#8220;good relations&#8221; between white cops and the black community in big cities is even deisrable?</p>
<p>I suppose the CW states that if relations were better, there would be more resident-police cooperation when it comes to gathering evidence and information. But the oh-so-clever CW is wrong when you realize the truth, that when someone gets plugged in the ghetto, and there are 30 people standing around who mysteriously &#8220;didn&rsquo;t see nuttin&rsquo;,&#8221; that the reasons they won&rsquo;t help are threefold:  (1) &#8220;Snitching&#8221; makes you a social pariah in the black community.  (2)  Fear of retribution  (3) &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to see another brother wind up in the hands of the man and his prisons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relations are bad because white cops must be present in black areas in a disproportionate force because blacks commit a disproportionate amount of the crime, and the cops must inevitably arrest a goodly number of their people.  I would be willing to bet that every black citizen of Oakland is related by first cousinhood or closer to someone who has been arrested.  Therefore, the average black Oaklander only knows cops in terms of taking one of their loved ones away to jail.</p>
<p>Indeed, if there were &#8220;good relations&#8221; between white cops and black citizens, in the way that the media/black community define &#8220;good relations,&#8221; then the police won&rsquo;t be allowed to arrest anybody.  Black crime would shoot sky high, the drug gangs would run Oakland, and since the cops would then be taken for &#8220;weak&#8221; and &#8220;chumps,&#8221; they would be sniped at and killed even more often.</p>
<p>My proposal is for very bad relations between the black community and white police.  As the Romans might have said, Oderint Dum Metuant.</p>

			<p>Where&rsquo;s the counter-deminstration?  How is it that these people can come out publicly and support this animal, and no police group, or any other group meets them in the street, if for no other purpose than to show people, Black and White, that murdering police is not justifiable. The police need to do more than play bagpipes and give gun salutes with blanks when there brother officers are gunned down by skum like Mixon.  They need to put pressure on local media to show the family members of these victims as the ONLY persons who deserve exposure and sympathy.  Furthermore, someone should be held accountable for allowing this murderer out of jail.</p>

This has really hit a nerve in the black community. I believe it has to do with the shooting by a white police officer of a black man in the BART station.</p>
<p>These murders have taken away blacks moral outrage. They wanted to turn the white police officer into the embodiment of pure white evil. That&rsquo;s all gone. Now they have to temper their comments. They can&rsquo;t talk about the white police officer as motivated by hatred of blacks. Now they have to be careful in what they say and their claims of hatred and racism.</p>
<p>For more absurd, convoluted justification, read this piece by Earl Ofari Hutchinson:</p>
<p><b>Oakland police shooting casts ugly glare on ex-felon desperation</b></p>

<p>When people march in celebration of the murder of Police officers by a child rapist/murderer, you don&rsquo;t have the Country of your childhood, you have Nigeria.</p>

			<p>How does O&rsquo;Reilly know what percentage of black people were against these killing?</p>
<p>What white person really knows the thought process of black people?</p>
<p>If 99% of black people were against these killings why aren&rsquo;t more speaking out?</p>

			<p>To Fritz:</p>
<p>I agree&hellip;where&rsquo;s the counter-demonstration? Unfortunately, I think the answer is still the same old double standard: No matter what the issue, blacks are always off-limits to any criticism. </p>
<p>Obama runs his mouth about the Special Olympics on a late night talk show and&hellip;nothing. He makes a self-serving &#8220;mea culpa&#8221; phone call to the head of the Special Olympics and the whole thing goes away. Now, had a white president made a similarly ignorant comment about sickle cell anemia&hellip;well, the impeachment would&rsquo;ve already started. </p>
<p>I firmly believe that somehow, in some twisted sort of racial &#8220;logic,&#8221; any group that came out against the Uhuru movement would quickly be branded a racist organization. Even at the depths of their behavior (i.e. publicly praising a rapist who murdered four police officers), blacks still somehow manage to avoid any criticism from the public. </p>
<p>If 99% of the black community disagrees with the Uhurus, then where&rsquo;s a credible black public figure to say so? Why isn&rsquo;t someone like Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, or Bryant Gumble getting on TV and saying, &#8220;The Uhurus don&rsquo;t speak for me. My thoughts lie solely with the families of the murdered officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oprah, who feels compelled to comment on so many other social issues, could easily use her show as a platform to announce the black community&rsquo;s support for the murdered officers. Of course, she won&rsquo;t&hellip;and millions of wide-eyed white Americans will continue filling her coffers.</p>
<p>Blacks are no more than what you let them be. They&rsquo;re people&hellip;period. They don&rsquo;t have special powers, and the privileged status they&rsquo;ve been allowed to enjoy is no more authentic than the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes. </p>

			<p>Dozens march for Mixon, against police<br>
Charles Burress, Chronicle Staff Writer</p>
<p>Thursday, March 26, 2009</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;OPD you can&rsquo;t hide - we charge you with genocide,&#8221; chanted the demonstrators as they marched along MacArthur Boulevard, near the intersection with 74th Avenue where Mixon, 26, a fugitive parolee, gunned down two motorcycle officers who had pulled him over in a traffic stop. He killed two more officers who tried to capture him where he was hiding in his sister&rsquo;s apartment nearby.</p>
<p>The protest was organized by the Oakland branch of the Uhuru Movement, whose flyers for the march declared, &#8220;Stop Police Terror.&#8221; Many marchers wore T-shirts featuring Mixon&rsquo;s photo, including a woman identified by march organizers as Mixon&rsquo;s mother. The woman declined to comment and gave her name only as Athena.</p>
<p>Lolo Darnell, one of Mixon&rsquo;s cousins at the demonstration, said, &#8220;He needs sympathy too. If he&rsquo;s a criminal, everybody&rsquo;s a criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about police allegations that Mixon was suspected in several rapes, including that of a 12-year-old girl, marcher Mandingo Hayes said, &#8220;He wasn&rsquo;t a rapist. I don&rsquo;t believe that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bystanders had mixed reactions. Nicole Brown said that she can&rsquo;t condone murder but that police don&rsquo;t respect residents of the area. Daria Belt said she had no sympathy for the protesters but sympathized for Mixon&rsquo;s family.<br>

			<p>&#8220;You just had to see this coward O&rsquo;Reilly tonight on his show covering this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every time I channel surf past his show he is going on and on about the fact that the teamsters union objects to mexican truck drivers and their pollution spewing trucks driving in the united states.  Apparently Obama sided with the teamsters and has stopped this mexican truck traffic.  By doing this, Obama has saved all of 100 American jobs.  This is better than any president has done for American workers in the last 40 years.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly is just another anti white elitist pretending to be conservative so as to attract white viewers and readers.</p>
<p>That is why I despise conservatives as much as I do liberals.  Neither is pro white.  Every time some one assumes I am a conservative or a Republican I always reply Absolutely not, I am a white nationalist and race realist.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the whites who raised him were proud members of the communist party of Hawaii.  Then off to communist and radical lest circles at Occidental college and Columbia.</p>
<p>Occidental college in S. California by the way, has Tim Wise &#8220;Whites must be exterminated&#8221; seminars every year.</p>

<p>I intend filing a complaint against the Oakland PD and the City of Oakland for not alerting the European American white community about the potential for interracial crimes being committed against them with the Oakland Police Review Board and the US Government Community Relations Agency that is responsible for relieving racial conflict in a community. What greater evidence is needed to recognize a conflict than the extreme disparity in black on white crimes in Oakland and America as compared to white on black crimes? </p>
<p>Any thoughts, facts, reports and opinions you may have that will assist me in preparing a complaint would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>This may the time for the European American white community to open up the door to candid  and honest discussion about race relations in America.  Thank you. </p>

<p>It seems to me the genocide is being conducted the other way around. They are the perpetrators and we are the victims.<br>

			<p>For a long time I have personally believed that only blacks should police black areas.  (Of course, in that case the converse would be true as well: that only whites should police white areas.) </p>
<p>Needless to say, this would result in the deterioration of police service in black areas, and would also result in massive corruption. But they would have only themselves to blame for it,  not Whitey. </p>
<p>This would eliminate any accusations, or even suspicions, that racism was involved in police actions. It would cut down drastically on complaints of racial discrimination. And criminals could not use that line of defense in court. Nor in any pitch for public sympathy.</p>
<p>Of course, it would also undermine the Diversity crowd&rsquo;s contention that were are all interchangeable and anyone can do any job anywhere, regardless of race, and that race is an irrelevant fiction anyway.    </p>
<p>Hence, it cannot be allowed!  We are all prisoners to the cult of Diversity.  We are forced to pay very heavily for it.</p>

<p>What can one add to that?  A pedophile sodomite rapist armed robber and murderer who kills 4 policemen (4!) in a few hours gets a &#8220;mixed&#8221; reaction from blacks.  Yikes!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bet on it.  I have observed that they&rsquo;ll complain about &#8220;white racism&#8221; and &#8220;white poleeeceseses&#8221; and all that jazz even if the cops involved in enforcing the law are black and the city&rsquo;s Police Chief is black.  They&rsquo;ll say that the cops and the chief are oreos, Toms and sellouts, and that the law enforcement system is somehow flawed.</p>
<p>Translation:  It&rsquo;s &#8220;flawed&#8221; in that it enforces the law in the first place, because they violate it so much.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about good cop-black relations, only that they are as bad as possible.  Oderint Dum Metuant.</p>

			<p>The support for this piece of debris has progressed beyond the merely &#8220;sick&#8221; to a fervent embrace of evil.  By not denouncing this, the black population and &#8220;leadership&#8221; in America has revealed evil itself to be evil.</p>
<p>I am not religious, but I am sensitive enough to understand what evil is and to be revolted by it.</p>
<p>While I was still on probation, I was once pulled over by a policeman for driving 43 mph in a 40 zone on North Union Blvd., here in Colorado Springs.  It was September, and the cops here get serious about cracking down on speeders in the mornings and afternoons when kids are on their way to and from school.  I had been a little inattentive, and had picked up speed heading downhill toward my turn home onto Woodmen Blvd.  I knew right away he would run my plates on the NCIC database and discover I was a convicted federal felon on probation and on the Terrorist Watch List.  </p>
<p>All he did was give me a verbal warning and ask me why my car was registered in Boulder.  I explained that my mother lives there, that she had been using my car for the three years I was locked up because it was more reliable than hers and got better gas mileage, and that she had reregistered it there.  It would not have occurred to me to shoot the fellow just for doing his job.</p>
<p>It also didn&rsquo;t occur to me to rape young girls while I was on probation, either.  I led a very low-profile existance back then, working six days a week at the first place that would hire me - a Subway restaurant - and going out to get my mail only at night, so the neighbors wouldn&rsquo;t see me.</p>
<p>For anyone who would call child-raping Mixon &#8220;a true hero, a soldier&#8221;, night has truly fallen.</p>

From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mixon&rsquo;s cousin, Dolores Darnell, 26, addressed the small crowd, calling him &#8216;a true hero, a soldier.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In a non-PC-controlled world, enraged White citizens and family members of the assasianted police officers would have shut this &#8216;demonstration&rsquo; down with extreme force.</p>
<p>Later, at the funeral yesterday:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums also attended the service, but was asked not to speak by at least one family of the victims, his spokesman said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/djckht</p>
<p>Ron Dellums? The one described as:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;unable - or unwilling - to address crime as a law enforcement problem rather than a social ill.</p>
<p>His first anti-crime measure was a proposal to hire ex-felons to city jobs, followed by a plan to spend anti-crime funds on street intervention workers to counsel and guide recently released parolees toward training programs and aid.</p>
<p>The only way a politician could get any softer on crime would be to hold a party in honor of convicted felons and pass out manuals on how to beat the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>the department [is] outmanned and outgunned in a city where the homicide rate is three times the national average and violent crime is off the charts&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/ctocq7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ctocq7</a></p>
<p>I was also angered to hear that Feinstein, Boxer and Brown attended  &mdash;  Feinstein even gave a speech.</p>
<p>If it were one of my family members, over my dead body would any of these communists have been allowed to show their faces  &mdash;  especially the hypocritical anti-Second Amendment Feinstein who is virulently against YOU carrying a weapon  &mdash;  or even owning one  &mdash;  yet reserves for herself the right to carry.</p>
<p>OF course, the lefties in California are already screaming for more gun control laws.</p>

<p>Dellums, Shwarzenegger, Feinstein, Boxer and Jerry Brown were all at the cop vigil.  With all their thug pandering and hatin&rsquo; on the 2nd Amendment through most of their whole political careers, they&rsquo;re unindicted co-conspirators in the murder of these 4 cops, IMHO.  Which makes me think that they actually attended the wrong vigil, that they really wanted to attend the vigil for Mixon but made a wrong turn.</p>
<p>Jerry Brown is running for Governor, but DiFi is so popular in the state that all she has to do is announce that she&rsquo;s running, and mount a semi-serious campaign, and she&rsquo;s as good as Governor.  I always thought that Education Department head Jack O&rsquo;Connell was the front runner, with all his hatin&rsquo; on white public school teachers, but I forgot about Brown (who can run again b/c term limits were passed after he left the Governor&rsquo;s office in 1983), and Feinstein, who toyed with running during the 2003 recallapalooza, but read the tea leaves and declined   &mdash;   she probably wants to be closer to home, and perhaps she thinking about the Presidency, in spite of the last election, being a Governor is a better springboard still.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get Michael Savage&rsquo;s like of Jerry Brown, the former had the latter on his show this week to talk about the shootings, the latter of course not saying anything about his questionable record. </p>

			<p>I remember Jerry Brown&rsquo;s effectiveness as Gov.  He took over from Reagan (who left a $9 Billion surplus) and pissed it away within 2 years.  He left office with the state broke.  California used to be a paradise.  Now its a toilet.</p>
<p>Black America is insane.  Leave them alone and they complain about the lack of police protection, enforce the law and they complain about the police.  They are worse than spoiled children. </p>

			<p>I situation where an convicted armed robber who rapes a pre-teen and murders four policemen, 2 in cold blood, point-blank and these people celebrate the man who ended not one, not two, but four white men&rsquo;s lives and wrecked a girl, most likely for life&hellip;&hellip;.Quote</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its quite obvious that the killer/child rapist Mixon was NOT a normal person by any standards, in fact I believe he must&rsquo;ve been also mentally disturbed/unbalanced, I think I read somewhere his I.Q was also very low almost bordering on retardation which made him very paranoid and his past prison experience must&rsquo;ve made his mental state even much worse. Is it possible he was raped in prison beaten up by much rougher men? if his family was educated middle class ppl we would&rsquo;ve never heard anything remotely like this, but his family is from the lower classes what was his childhood like? most likely it was&rsquo;nt like the Police officers parents. Its kinda sad the Uhuru group is using this for crass politics making this tragic event into a circus, remember the BART cop shot a similar man only the man was handcuffed face down on the floor this is like throwing gasoline into the &#8220;Uhuru&#8221; fire.        </p>
