<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>JAY-Z has credited hip-hop with improving race relations across America  &mdash;  because white kids who idolise him and SNOOP DOGG don&rsquo;t become racists.</p>
<p>The rapper insists there&rsquo;s too much negativity about the musical genre and its related culture  &mdash;  and few dwell on the good it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>He explains, &#8220;It has changed America immensely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp.; Hip-hop has done more than any leader, politician, or anyone to improve race relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism is taught in the home .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it&rsquo;s very hard to teach racism to a teenager who idolises, say, Snoop Dogg. It&rsquo;s hard to say, &#8216;That guy is less than you.&rsquo; The kid is like, &#8216;I like that guy, he&rsquo;s cool. How is he less than me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why this generation is the least racist generation ever. You see it all the time. Go to any club. People are intermingling, hanging out, enjoying the same music.&#8221;<br>

			<p>While I myself like rap music, a lot of people don&rsquo;t like rap at all and so rap also creates &#8216;racism&rsquo; where none existed. I would have to say Snoop Dog is the wrong person to be lecturing others about racism.</p>

			<p>Actually hip-hop makes blacks&rsquo; inferior culture all the more obvious to most whites. Even the stupid white kids who listen to this garbage understand on some level that the lifestyle being glorified is backwards. Its just a modern minstrel show. </p>

			<p>And what happens when this white teenager becomes an adult, in fact a middle-aged adult?  This rap interest among whites is more or less an adolescent thing, their form of rebellion.</p>

<p>The passage of time reveals all. Find that same kid 10 years later and ask him what he thinks. I remember growing up in the 70s and idolizing black baseball players. That was my view of black people. I remember thinking in school when slavery and segregation were discussed, &#8216;why would anyone not like these people&rsquo;? I got my answer when my family moved from a smaller town to a major metropolitan area and when I got my first real face to face with real blacks in the military. The more I found out about them the less I liked them.  </p>

Propaganda works and white kids are dragged down to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Unforunately, this &#8216;least racist generation&rsquo; is doing little more than letting their guard down. Blacks are still blacks and behave as such. If whites are having more interactions with blacks, it only means we&rsquo;re going to see increasing incidents of black on white violence. These naive white kids aren&rsquo;t going to know what hit &#8216;em. Literally.</p>

			<p>Racism is not taught in the home, it&rsquo;s learned in the world when the evidence of one&rsquo;s own eyes overcomes the testimony of the MSM.  I see these White boys hanging out with Blacks, subservient and craving some of that soul, that cool, that seems to be the Black equivalent of character or achievement.  The Blacks enjoy having a pet White boy, I&rsquo;m sure, but only the dullest and most servile Whites will continue in these unequal &#8220;friendships.&#8221;  </p>

			<p>Snoop Dogg&rsquo;s first hit was &#8220;187&#8221;, a song whose chorus celebrates murdering an undercover police officer.</p>
<p>While it may be true that in many clubs different races enjoy the same music, it is typically whites who listen to and enjoy black music, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Predictably, Jay-Z is using the term &#8220;racist&#8221; to designate anyone who is not pro-black.  </p>

			<p>Since this article touches on portrayal of blacks in the media, I thought I would relate this story:</p>
<p>I went to Office Depot yesterday to get a wireless network card for my laptop (it&rsquo;s kind of old - in computer years). So I was looking around the office technology aisles trying to locate one. A black employee, male, around 25, was stocking shelves and asked if I needed help. I said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m looking for a wireless network card for a laptop.&#8221; He looked around blankly then got on his walkie-talkie and mumbled something to whoever he was calling. They exchanged communications a couple of times and then the black guy asks me, &#8220;Uh, what&rsquo;s it called again?&#8221; So I repeated. He then said, &#8220;[Name] will help you with that.&#8221; Thirty seconds later a young white guy about 21 comes up and leads me to the wireless network cards for laptops and explains all I needed to know about different options.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real situation. Now, how would this situation have appeared in an Office Depot television commercial? A white male customer near 40, a black employee, and a white employee. Who would have been the dumb one who didn&rsquo;t know what product he needed? Who would have been the clueless employee who never heard of the very common product? And who would have been the genius employee with all of the answers? Someone said it before - cognitive dissonence.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the times they are a changin. The parents of this Snoop loving teen are confused themselves as they worshiped Hendrix and maybe Prince. According to what I read from Pat Buchanan, the Frankfurt School/Gramscians had a goal of taking over popular culture in their struggle. </p>

			<p>Any white kids who idolize rappers, should be forced to take a walk across Harlem, alone. Incorribible cases should be made to do it at 1 AM. That would shock them back to race reality, real quick. That is, if they live through the experience.</p>

			<p>I have been interested in audio engineering since the 1990&rsquo;s, and listened to every type of music to study studio production methods. Jay-Z is a hypocrite who used to play second-fiddle to a rapper named Jaz; they were members of the &#8220;original tents of kedar&#8221; sect that called themselves &#8220;nubian islamic hebrews&#8221; - they believe that blacks were biblical prophets and Whites were cave-dwelling devils. This vile propaganda was based on revisionist romanticism about black history. This guy changes his image to a &#8220;goodfella&#8221; gangster, and becomes a major success in the industry. It&rsquo;s all a charade to con Whites into buying their music, cause blacks usually bootleg the tapes/CD&rsquo;s and the so-called rap &#8220;artists&#8221; lose royalties. Just like liberal White voters put a bogus POTUS in the White House, idiotic White supporters of rap put these idiots in gated estates. The real racism is all coming from blacks, they are the epitome of hatred.<br>

<p>This should be required listening for white girls starting at age 13.  Let them know exactly how savage these bastards are.<br>
Of course some of them would be aroused by the sheer bestiality of the &#8220;lyrics&#8221; ( for want of a better word) but I guess that we can&rsquo;t save them all.</p>

<p><br>
You really got to the heart of something there in my opinion. I&rsquo;ve seen this too, and to some degree almost all of us are &#8216;infected&rsquo;. Keep in mind some pet whites in urban areas need to continue in these &#8216;friendships&rsquo; not just as a way to show they are sensitive but literally as a means of survival.</p>
<p>Once I actually saw 2 white kids fight each other after school, only for the approval of a third black kid who was there watching or for blacks in general (the one white kid who was the instigator, but clearing neither one really wanted to fight. The aggressive one was doing it in some way for the black kid there watching). I was walking by and saw the confrontation. It was only when I was right up to them standing beside them that I could someone sense this was what was going on. I don&rsquo;t remember saying much to them, or saying anything at all but I most likely said something. Just go home, maybe. What&rsquo;s going on? They went to home. I should have gone with one of the boys to their home and spoke to his parents. Just to say their son was in a fight and no one was hurt. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s appropriate in this day and age for an adult white male to be walking with a youngster. though. A long story I know&hellip; This was a mixed neighborhood but I actually lived in a black neighborhood nearby. There were two white kids who lived on my street I remember in particular. They would play with the local black kids in the neighborhood. The black kids would abuse and pick on the oldest brother, bad, until the white kid would abuse his little brother. Then he was nearly like one of the family. Then all the kids would pick on and abuse the little brother. As a continous pattern. It looked pretty rough sometimes. I assume the little brother is some kind of sex change by now. He definitely had the tendencies, and I would say substantial emotional problems or lack of development, even as an 8 or 9 year old. He would like cling on you. They were tough kids though. They would play in my yard sometimes. Once I told the little brother, just go home. When they are picking on you just go home. It seemed like he would stay though. He was more afraid of being seen a coward than he was of going home. Like an invisible force held him there. Perhaps he understood the abuse would be worse later if he deprived them of their fun. I don&rsquo;t know. There were three of them, they had older sister. Their older sister had a baby when she was around 16 or 17. I&rsquo;m not going to say it was a surprise that the baby was white, but it certainly was.</p>

If you have lost touched with your own and your ancestors identity then yes, you could be thrilled by ghetto music and black behavior musical or otherwise.

The Blacks enjoy having a pet White boy, I&rsquo;m sure, but only the dullest and most servile Whites will continue in these unequal &ldquo;friendships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not just the dull white boys who act in a subservient manner to blacks. Many middle-class white boys have been feminized, and lack the masculine character of white men and boys who lived in past generations. I blame radical feminism for this tragedy, which tries to raise white boys and girls in a similar manner, that suggests there is no difference between the genders.</p>
<p>White boys today are desperate for virile, tough, and manly role models. Past generations of white boys looked up to manly men like Gen. Robert E. Lee, Gen. George S. Patton, Rocky Marciano, John Wayne, Clark Gable, Frank Sinatra, Audie Murphy, Charles Lindberg, Douglas MacArthur, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ernest Hemmingway as role models. It was normal and widely-accepted for boys to get into fist-fights with other boys when growing up, which helped to toughen them up. Outdoor activities like scouting, fishing, swimming in ponds and rivers, tree climbing, and rough sports, were much more common.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s feminised world, white boys lack manly role models among white adults, and therefore turn to ghetto black culture to search for tough male role models. </p>
<p>Among white gay males, there is a large sub-culture known as &#8220;Dinge-Queens&#8221;, which refers to white men who seek to have sex mostly with ghetto black males. In this way, they hope some of the virile maculinity of blacks, can be transferred to them.</p>
<p>Feminism may represent a greater threat to the survival of the white race than non-whites, because it deprives white males of their manhood. Feminism is also responsible for the declining white fertility, which is causing a decline in the global white population. </p>

<p>To show you how misplaced some of this fear is about permanent damage to the white psyche, even I listened to this kinda stuff for about a year or so when I was like 18 to 19.  It got really old really quickly.  And I was hardly a left winger in those days, I was more like a non-racial right winger.  About the time I quit listening to that stuff is when I became a racial right winger.  I probably turned 30 years old when I turned 20.</p>

			<p>Hip-Hop may improve race relations between whites and blacks but the real question is this, were race relations ever that big of a problem. If the big problem is being solved then why are more young people killing each other every year. Go back to the year 1960 and check out the murder rate of young people both black and white. <br>

			<p>&#8220;elitist&#8221; is quite right about Miles Davis and John Coltrane, two great, sophisticated musicians well worthy of anyone&rsquo;s attention. (Examples might easily be multiplied: Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, etc.) </p>
<p>What this really goes to show is how an intellectual and spiritual collapse has occurred WITHIN black American culture. It is significant that this collapse has occurred SINCE the civil rights movement, affirmative action, etc.</p>

			<p>As an aside, I see many cars from the hood and have noticed one thing in common, the music CD&rsquo;s left in these car are of 100% black musicians. No only is this unusual in itself, but when one takes considers that only 13% of the population is black, you&rsquo;ve got some serious contempt for all other races. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Feminism may represent a greater threat to the survival of the white race than non-whites, because it deprives white males of their manhood. Feminism is also responsible for the declining white fertility, which is causing a decline in the global white population.&#8221;</p>

<p>I totally agree. Every one of the early feminazis was a communist with Russian parents and grandparents, part of the Trotsky, Emma Goldman, Leon cologowitz diaspora.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of communist history.  Go back to 1910.  You will find the same feminazi themes.  A lot of the idiot liberals who worshipped Lenin in the 1920&rsquo;s wrote about how wonderful that the Russian revolution &#8220;liberated&#8221; Russian women from childcare and housework.</p>
<p>Of course they were not bothered with childcare because what with starvation, poor medical care and other problems, Russians in the 1920&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t have many children.  Cooking was no burden because there was so little food.  And trading housework for slave labor in heavy industry subject to the sexual demands of the communist managers was according to the deluded idiot liberals just wonderful.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s feminazis just repeat the communist mantras of the 1920&rsquo;s.  Marriage and housework are horrible slavery, but working in some horrible job is liberating.</p>
<p>Just as the early Christians used nunneries to subvert paganism, the communists have used women to destroy European and N. American civilization.<br>

			<p>I blame radical feminism for this tragedy, which tries to raise white boys and girls in a similar manner, that suggests there is no difference between the genders.</p>
<p>To see an example of this in film, watch an old movie of Sean Connery&rsquo;s titled &#8220;Zardoz&#8221;</p>

			<p>As usual the black point of view on race relations is the only credible one in the eyes of the MSM.  Who cares what white people think because we just don&rsquo;t count anymore.  The general tenor of this article is that whites who have contact with gangsta rap and hip hop culture shed their innate racism and hatred towards blacks, thus creating a brave new world.  </p>
<p>Blacks, of course, are born into this world having unrequited love for all races but especially white folks.  It&rsquo;s the mindless and irrational racism of ingrate whites that make otherwise peaceful black people into violent criminals. Pay no attention to the interracial crime stats. </p>
<p>Curiously, Jay-Z is saying that when whites assimilate to black culture there is interracial amity.  Funny, because when whites have admonished blacks to speak proper english, finish high school, work for a living and refrain from committing crime they are called haters and bigots.  Blacks who answer this call are called &#8220;sellouts&rsquo; and &#8220;uncle Tom&rsquo;s&#8221; by Jay-Z and his fellow hip-hopsters, so I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s a major hypocrite.       </p>
<p>How disgusting but then again the MSM is full of left wing cranks and anti-white haters and propagandists. <br>

<p>Are you some kind of thief? They do say white criminals choose black victims 3% of the time. Are you one of the 3%? If you are, you&rsquo;ve got some considerable work to do to make up the gap, being everything has to be equal and all.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Since the fifties haven&rsquo;t black artists been popular among white youth? How about the Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Temptations, Sam and Dave, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, the list is endless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but at least many of those artists were talented musicians, vocalists, and/or songwriters.  Today&rsquo;s rap/&#8221;hip hop&#8221; culture is based purely on image.  Many &#8220;hip hop&#8221; stars are actually suburban black kids with manufactured (by whites) &#8220;gangsta&#8221; images and lyrics/music written for them (by whites).  Rap in its essence is an admission of a complete lack of talent.  No instruments, no singing, just vulgar poetry which is usually written by someone else.  For every deserving black musician, there are a dozen who are propped up by pro-black racism in the music industry.</p>
<p>Even among &#8220;white&#8221; rock groups, there is discrimination against American whites.  A depressing amount of mainstream rock is British in origin.  I suppose it&rsquo;s natural for people to be attracted to &#8220;exotic&#8221;-sounding music, but in light of these attitudes it&rsquo;s no wonder that most white children see no purpose in pursuing music as an artistic endeavor.</p>

<p>Funny you mentioning &ldquo;Zardoz&rdquo;, I was honestly thinking about it today myself.<br>
I was thinking about global demographic growth in the third world and how that has created a situation where we in the West end up having so much, when they must share less resources amoungst their greater populations. Thus for global equality to be achieved on a material level. It would mean we&rsquo;d have to give up our quality of living to sustain global birth rates. <br>
I made me think of that scene in Zardoz where you have the choosen few who are the privledged, lazy, decadent, certifible, bored, apathetic and the senile who are wishing for death.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Most White kids grow up and realize the stupidity of rap as they grow older&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Reality hits them hard when they apply for colleges and enter the job market.</p>
<p>My middle daughter is going through this right now at her high school  &mdash;  White and Asian kids sit helplessly by as NAMs with far lower GPAs, SAT and AP scores are fawned over by college admissions officers  &mdash;  offered full scholarships, flown in to select colleges for tours, flooded by outreach programs offering tutoring and other help, even monthly walk around money is included while they&rsquo;re in college. All the while, White and Asian kids receive multiple rejection notices.  Middle daughter tells me her campus is awash in Asian and White tears this week as the rejection notices come in  &mdash;  and the kids get a harsh dose of their brave new &#8216;real&rsquo; world.</p>
<p>I imagine the job world is just as unfair to them as they&rsquo;re locked out of careers and promotions because of AA, watching as those with far lesser qualifications are snapped up for choice high-paying jobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bitter pill to swallow.</p>
<p>Yeah, that should cure &#8216;em.</p>

			<p>As a point of comparison, heavy metal is almost all white and thrives with absolutely ZERO support from any mainstream entertainment media. They all play their own instruments, write their own songs and it is unabashedly masculine in its subject matter: history, power, myth, war, struggle, etc. An EXCELLENT alternative for the lost white males trapped in the hip-hop ghetto.</p>

			<p>Beyonce fans &#8216;among least intelligent but Beethoven fans are cleverest&rsquo;</p>
<p>Your taste in music reflects your intelligence with fans of Beyonce among the most stupid and Beethoven listeners the cleverest, it is claimed.</p>
<p>Fans of Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z also ranked poorly in terms of IQ and lovers of rapper Lil&rsquo; Wayne were deemed least intelligent.</p>
<p>The study was carried out by Virgil Griffiths, a PhD student in America, who compared students&rsquo; scores in SAT exams with their favourite music acts and genres by analysing data on social networking sites.</p>
<p>Those who prefer indie music are most intelligent, while pop, rock and gospel fans were all ranked at the lower end of the scale.</p>
<p>Fans of legendary acts like Queen, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Frank Sinatra and Bob Marley are all around average and above when it comes to intelligence, according to Griffiths.</p>
<p>Radiohead, U2 and Bob Dylan all have intelligent fans, he said.</p>
<p>Fans of Beyonce, Timberlake and Jay-Z all tended to score below 1,000 on SAT scores, with the average being a mark of 1071 out of 1600.</p>
<p>Fans of Beethoven were way ahead of the rest with an average score of over 1300.</p>
<p>On his website, musicthatmakesyoudumb, Griffith describes the results of his study as &#8220;hilarity incarnate&#8221;.</p>
<p>He introduces the test by saying: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve listened to artists who after listening to I thought to myself &#8216;Wow&hellip; loving this rubbish says a lot about someone and how much they got going on in their head&rsquo;. Could one&rsquo;s musical tastes say something about intelligence?&#8221; </p>

<p>Margaret:</p>
<p>I also have no love for militant feminists because I&rsquo;ve witnessed the untold damage they&rsquo;ve done to the schools with their specious, stupid theories and their obscene war on boys.</p>
<p>Maybe sooner than we think, some small form of poetic justice will be served on the militant feministas as the demographics of Europe and the US change.</p>
<p>I doubt the Muslims, when they finally enslave Europe and impose Sharia Law, will have ANY tolerance for feminist theory.  Same thing when those &#8216;macho&rsquo;, misogynistic cultures that the USG has been importing wholesale for 40 years takes power  &mdash;  what tolerance will they have for feminazi shrieking, whining and demands?</p>
<p>That should shut &#8216;em up (and yes, I realize they will shut ME up as well, the process is already under way&hellip;)</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t stand heavy metal, but I see Civilized Neighbor&rsquo;s point.  Heavy metal IS White, but it also seems to me that it&rsquo;s fans are wimpy boys wanting to seem tough.  All that mock virile posing, stretch pants, huge hair, is really puerile.  Maybe it&rsquo;s the best they can do, growing up in mom&rsquo;s apartment and dying of boredom at school.  Hopefully these White boys graduate to motorcycles and a useful trade.  <br>
     I do like to see White boys on their skateboards.  You can bust your head on those things, especially when you are trying to outdo your friends.  It&rsquo;s real risk, real masculinity.  There are &#8220;skater&#8221; fashions and all that hodad stuff, but to gain any real status, a kid has to show his skill in public.  If they were farm boys of 150 years ago, they&rsquo;d be racing plow horses.  </p>
