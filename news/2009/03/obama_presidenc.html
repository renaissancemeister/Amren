<h1>Obama Presidency Gives Black Americans New Pride in Their Country</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandra Tan and Emma D. Sapong, Buffalo News, March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black Americans don&rsquo;t usually descend on Washington, D. C., waving the Stars and Stripes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That changed in January. Hundreds of thousands of black men and women returned to the Mall in D. C. with flags in hand. They stood shoulder-to-shoulder with many white Americans and proclaimed how proud they were to be citizens of this nation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No American likes to be labeled &#8220;unpatriotic.&#8221; Yet for decades, the concept of patriotism among African-Americans has been difficult to define  &mdash;  one clouded by a legacy of slavery, racism and discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As in any community, feelings of patriotism are wide ranging among African-Americans. Yet many would agree that their feelings for the United States are complicated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>History of commitment</b></p>
<p>Local black leaders, military veterans and residents point to black history as evidence of their long commitment to this country. From the days of slavery to present times, they said, African-Americans helped build this nation and defend it.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans were the first to die in the Revolutionary War,&#8221; Mesiah said, &#8220;and we&rsquo;ve been involved in the military in every single war this country has had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lillian S. Williams, an associate professor of African-American history at the University at Buffalo, said blacks in the military faced every imaginable form of discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Buffalo resident Dewitt Lee, 31, said his patriotism has been rooted exclusively in the triumphs of trailblazing African-Americans who pushed for civil rights and equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand what we&rsquo;ve done to build this country as black Americans,&#8221; said Lee, promotions director at WUFO radio, which organized a bus trip to the inauguration. &#8220;I value the lives that came before me and the sacrifices that were made to make this country what it is. It would be wrong for me to not recognize what they&rsquo;ve done to pave the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Struggling to make it</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some question how it&rsquo;s possible to love a country that, in many instances, hasn&rsquo;t loved them back. While blacks have made great strides in this country, many bristle at the notion that it&rsquo;s time they got over the past and embraced this country&rsquo;s greatness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone thinks that you can simply get over the memories of your great-grandmother not having the opportunity to read, or your great-great-grandmother being enslaved,&#8221; said Pridgen, 44, &#8220;You should just &#8216;get over it&rsquo; because someone is elected, or because there are certain opportunities? They are sadly mistaken. It takes time for any great hurt to be healed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even African-Americans who consider themselves very patriotic may not necessarily embrace all the visual trappings of red, white and blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those people who have been staunch flag wavers are associated with staunch opponents of black liberation,&#8221; said UB professor Williams.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;America has some flaws,&#8221; Pridgen said. &#8220;However, there is not another country that I could be shipped off to, that I would want to go to. Even though it has its flaws, it has a process where involved people can change the flaws, or repair those flaws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama, many said, is the best example. They noted that in no other country has a black man been elected to lead a nation in which the majority of its citizens aren&rsquo;t also black.</p>
<p>&#8220;My love for America has grown to include America as a whole, because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the majority of the country voted for Obama,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;They looked past the things on the surface and considered what really counts, and that&rsquo;s the content of a man&rsquo;s character.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Sure, they don&rsquo;t usually wave American flags around.  Except they did during the Civil Rights era in the South, as an &#8220;up yours&#8221; to white Southerners.  As if to say the Yankees won that war, and all power through the barrel of a gun.</p>

			<p>If I were black I&rsquo;m sure I would be radical at the very least and borderline homicidal toward all whites. Why? Because even I were handed a good life by benevolent whites I would understand that I could never be truly accepted by them as &#8220;one of us.&#8221; And this is as it should be. Blacks can never be one of us. It follows that they can never feel love for America, which is still, if imperfectly, an expression of us, whites. As a white I respect blacks enough to fear them and understand that there is absolutely no solution short of total separation from them.</p>

<p>If white liberals thought blacks would &#8220;come around&#8221; if we elected a black as president, Im afraid they are sorely mistaken. IMO, there is NOTHING that can ever be done to end this black hatred of whites and America. No matter how far whites bend over backwards, no matter how much preferance they are given, no matter how much money is spent on them it will never be enough. </p>

			<p>Nonsense. Slavery was not a construct of white people but of cultural attitudes of earlier times, especially amongst the rich, in most societies including Arabic, Black, Chinese, and Indian societies most long before the United States was ever a nation.</p>
<p>Slavery was an institution of the times practiced by all races and it was European nations, beginning with the Quaker inspired abolition movement (e.g. Christians) that took the sacrificial determined steps to stop slavery in their countries and eventually expand the scope to stamping out slavery worldwide.</p>
<p>The truth is that whites slaves were America&rsquo;s first slaves, were slaves for life, and their slavery was hereditary (their children were born into slavery). Whites were auctioned on the block with children sold and separated from their parents and wives sold and separated from their husbands where they were worked to death in the sugar mills of Barbados and Jamaica and the plantations of Virginia.</p>
<p>As Michael A. Hoffman explains in &#8216;They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America and Industrial Britain&rsquo;, &#8220;Bound Whites in early America called themselves slaves and nine-tenths of the White slavery in America was conducted without indentures of any kind but according to the so-called &#8220;custom of the country,&#8221; as it was known, which was lifetime slavery administered by the White slave merchants themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In George Sandys laws for Virginia, Whites were enslaved &#8220;forever.&#8221; The service of Whites bound to Berkeley&rsquo;s Hundred was deemed &#8220;perpetual.&#8221; These accounts have been simply left out of many &#8220;standard reference works&#8221; because this authentic history no longer is politically correct in today&rsquo;s modern liberal social construct. </p>
<p>Yet white slavery was an extensive operation and only around the start of the 18th century do we begin to encounter more &#8220;servitude&#8221; on the basis of a contract of indenture. But even in that period there was kidnapping of Anglo-Saxons into slavery and the numbers may surprise you. North Africans alone are estimated to have enslaved a million white Europeans who were cruelly treated. And we haven&rsquo;t even broached the subject of convict slavery.</p>
<p>The modern liberals are in control of the public indoctrination education centers and they simply rewrite history to their liking and dissiminate it to effect their ideological worldvew in students who then grow up believing what they were programmed to believe. Not much more to it really.</p>

			<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s great that we could elect a minority, especially a black, president. I wonder how it will feel for blacks, however, when he turns out to be a miserable, stubborn, wretched, ignorant (not to mention unethical and traitorous) failure.</p>
<p>America is tanking. Trillion dollar annual deficits as far as the eye can see. A welfare state to end all welfare states, serving a population full of people (hispanics, african americans) untempered by European dignity and restraint.</p>
<p>This is the fall we all expected. It&rsquo;s here - and it&rsquo;s accelerating.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;For blacks, patriotism is &ldquo;clouded by a legacy of slavery, racism, and discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A magnificent excuse that will serve another 2500 years as the explanation for Black dysfunctionality, Black crime. Meanwhile, let&rsquo;s milk it for all it&rsquo;s wor, right?</p>

			<p>Blacks constantly complain about this country but they never want to leave.</p>
<p>How do you deal with a co-worker who constantly complains about the company but never tries to find another job?</p>
<p>You would probably listen to the disgruntled co-worker a few times but after that ignore him or tune him out.</p>

<p>AFRICAN-Americans</p>
<p>They are African first, and American comes in second place.</p>
<p>It is a continual puzzle to me why these African-Americans pledge allegiance to the &#8220;motherland&#8221;, hate the country they are in, whine in 1001 ways about the wickedness of whites, and yet do nothing about it!  Maybe this is yet more evidence of the 85 average IQ&hellip;..</p>

It was Ghana that offered automatic citizenship to American &#8220;victims of racial oppression&#8221;. (I cannot but think, however, that they will change their minds once they see the first arrivals.)</p>

Reminds me of our new lab assistant. She´s competent enough (not much affimative action here) and stereotypical enough (small,fat,cornrows,loud). But at the drop of a hat, she will go in a rant about the horrors of slavery. And she´s a full-blood Ashanti fresh from Ghana :).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re almost right.  But if you read the Amren article on the history of Jamestown published here just one or two dates ago, you will note that Blacks were brought to Jamestown in 1619 and that is not after the practice of White slavery in the colonies.  However, what everyone seems to miss all the time is that there had always been virtuall slavery in Europe for most Whites.  Up until the Black Plaque of the 14th century peasants were serfs who belonged to the land and the overlord, always a titled noble ruled them.  They could not leave the land nor could they do anything, including marry, without the lord&rsquo;s leave.  They were forced to practice Christianity and adhere to strict rules inposed by king, church, and lord - and not necessarily in that order.  </p>
<p>When Jamestown looked like it would succeed, the crown became involved directly.  It was a simple connection for the crown to deal with what it found as excess population, dessenters, criminals and political undesireable to be sent to all British colonies for permanent work as free labor slaves.  Almost everyone will recall that Georgia was a penal colony, named for King George the First.  Blacks claim they built the country, but these facts make the counter argument strong, if not absolute that when Whites were cheaper, they were used.  No one cared that Whites died in the hot conditions before Blacks because they were easily replaced.  The realization that Blacks held up better in hot, humid conditions only became obvious later on.</p>
<p>As commoners acquired more rights - an event greatly due to The 17th century Second English Civil War and Cromwell&rsquo;s reign as Lord Protector of England, Ireland and Wales giving rise to Parlementary power, the curtailment in permanent slavery of Whites (at least for Englishmen) combined with economics to makes Blacks more advantageous.  But limited White indenturement and the Georgia penal colony still went on. </p>
<p>Later still, after the founding of the USA and only Blacks were used for outright slave labor in the South, virtual White slavery rose in the North, as it did in England, due to the Industrial Revolution.  So by 1860, Blacks were seen as slaves without hope of ever being a free people.  But they worked in daylight, six days a week, and domestics worked in conditions far nicer than poor Whites in the North.  The Southern Black slaves were fed, clothed and given shelter that while dwarfed by the magnificent plantation mansions their owners lived in, had four walls and were freestanding.  They had fireplaces and beds.  They followed the same aquarian schedule that any farmer did.  Along the way, they developed a distinct culture, were able to play music, dance and go to church - or not.  </p>
<p>Contrast this to the poor Northern Whites who as failed farmers, perhaps victims of the Millerite scare of the early 19th century in New England (look it up) were forced to take jobs in the new factories.  No one forced them by physical coersion, but they were forced by circumstances.  Once employed, they worked 16 hour days, men, women and children - and they lived in gloomy dorms with common walls.  They bought they food and provisions at the company store for high prices and so were permanently indebted to the company.  These Whites were sickly, unhappy and died young.  Many were permanently maimed or killed in the machinery in the factories as there was no consideration for safety or laws to protect them from all sorts of abuses, including rape, by their employers and bosses.  As much as you dummkopf posters here may hate the idea, Karl Marx is responsible for your good working conditions and labor laws.  </p>
<p>For the extention of the abuses of White slavery into the 20th century you need go no further than to study the history of that hallowed birthplace of country music, the coal mining country of Apalacha.  (I am a distant cousin to the Carter Family).</p>
<p>This is the history so often surpressed in this glorious Civil Rights conscious nation.  Even Amren posters seem to be unaware of it as a referrence point.</p>
<p>Why is it surpressed? Because the struggle between worker and boss is still going on.  Because the struggle between those who would cause you to be indebted for life and a just capitalist system has still yet to be realized.  Just look at all these Wall Street Robber Barons and others; Bank CEOs, etc., and their lawmaker cohorts in Congress.  This isn&rsquo;t new either, it has been going on for a long time.  Regardless, we never seem to be able to get it right and I doubt we will this time either.  That is because it seems to be a given that if someone is to succeed, it must by some law of survival be at the expense of someone else.  </p>
<p>Now, Whites are being made the losers so that Blacks and other non-White groups can succeed because the power shift in America has occured.  It is a huge change, make no mistake.  I woke up this morning and realized that what is going on is a revolution.  So far, it is a bloodless one.  Bloodless revolutions have occurred before, at least in small countries like Portugal.  We will have to see how smooth this one goes and some would argue that plenty of blood has been shed already and continues to be due to the police control of the general population while it is savaged by what the government has allowed.  I have been a victim of that myself, and more than once.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really disagree with the social programs that are being enacted now because I understand the history of capitalism and know that if most Republicans have their way, we will go on being exploited and used by the upper two percent of the wealthy, just like the lords and nobles took advantage of poorer Whites in the early days of the colonies and as they did up to the 14-17 century.  The past eight years have seen the acceleration of their inherent activity of sucking the wealth out of the middle class and created more powerless poor.  I also know that religious conservatives are nothing more than their political dupes.   There would be no need to rail against non-White people if their presence in the country was limited to under ten percent.<br>

<p>I know exactly how he feels. My grandmother had to quit school in the fourth grade to go to work. I remember it like it was yesterday instead of 1903. The &#8220;memories&#8221; are so horrendous that intensive therapy and medication have not relieved my pain. Or is it my grandmother&rsquo;s pain. Well, it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s pain.<br>
Someone born around 1964 could conceivable have had a great-great-great grandmother born in 1864. Perhaps he feels the slavery memories of his great-great-great-great grandmother. But then again she may not have been a slave, she might have been a slave owner.</p>

<p>Sorry, Ms.Tan and Ms. Sapong   &mdash;   they are citizens of a COUNTRY, <i>not</i> a nation.    Nations don&rsquo;t grant citizenship.  Countries do.    Like members of a tribe or a family, you are either BORN into a nation, or you are not.  But  I doubt either of you would understand.</p>

<p>The very same question applies in the case of England.  The strange jargon coming out of Britain today, even in The Times, is often bizarre to say the least. (And the reporters&rsquo; names still more bizarre.) This from the ancestral homeland of our language! </p>

Very true. Nations are groups bound together by<i> blood and culture,</i> not  by a passport or identity card&hellip; which anyone could get.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;Proposition Nation&#8221;, a pure invention of the Left (and the neo-con right), is NOT a nation!   It&rsquo;s a random bunch of people with similar ID cards and ZIP codes.</p>

<p>True.  Usually blacks descend on Washington waving guns and knives, and demanding the contents of one&rsquo;s wallet.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I live in Los Angeles and have heard many calls from the black community for Fred Goldman to &#8216;get over it&rsquo; and &#8216;just get on with his life&rsquo; (after the brutal slaying of his son at the hands of oj simpson) and that he should stop his pursuit of oj because it will &#8216;not bring his son back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the lame msm around here prints these comments repeatedly without commentary, as I&rsquo;m sure they agree with the black community (is it any wonder that the mainstream papers are crashing and burning?).</p>
<p>M. Goldman says he will NEVER &#8216;get over it&rsquo; and will continue to seek justice and the settlement he was awarded from the Civil Court until the day he dies.</p>

			<p>Blacks are not and never will be patriotic Americans, in the sense that whites and Asians understand patriotism.  They view the world differently, from a much&hellip; uh&hellip; simpler perspective.  It&rsquo;s all about &#8220;me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rude awakening that whites will come to in this country is that once the other races can take over control by force of sheer numbers, there will be no further pretense of civility.  All the &#8220;me first&#8221; behaviour that prevades the American black mind will be given free expression.   Look at Europe, South Africa, Zimbabwe&hellip; that is the future of white people in America.</p>
