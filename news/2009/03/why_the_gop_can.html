			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shelby Steele, Wall Street Journal, March 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Today conservatism is stigmatized in our culture as an antiminority political philosophy. In certain quarters, conservatism is simply racism by another name. And minorities who openly identify themselves as conservatives are still novelties, fish out of water.</p>
<p>{snip} Can&rsquo;t it be assumed, they would argue, that support of classic principles  &mdash;  individual freedom and equality under the law  &mdash;  constitutes support of minorities? And, given the fact that blacks and Hispanics often poll more conservatively than whites on most social issues, shouldn&rsquo;t there be an easy simpatico between these minorities and political conservatism?</p>
<p>But of course the reverse is true. There is an abiding alienation between the two  &mdash;  an alienation that I believe is the great new challenge for both modern conservatism and formerly oppressed minorities. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I think it began in a very specific cultural circumstance: the dramatic loss of moral authority that America suffered in the 1960s after openly acknowledging its long mistreatment of blacks and other minorities. Societies have moral accountability, and they cannot admit to persecuting a race of people for four centuries without losing considerable moral legitimacy. Such a confession  &mdash;  honorable as it may be  &mdash;  virtually calls out challenges to authority. And in the 1960s challenges emerged from everywhere  &mdash;  middle-class white kids rioted for &#8220;Free Speech&#8221; at Berkeley, black riots decimated inner cities across the country, and violent antiwar protests were ubiquitous. America suddenly needed a conspicuous display of moral authority in order to defend the legitimacy of its institutions against relentless challenge.</p>
<p>This was the circumstance that opened a new formula for power in American politics: redemption. If you could at least seem to redeem America of its past sins, you could win enough moral authority to claim real political power. Lyndon Johnson devastated Barry Goldwater because  &mdash;  among other reasons  &mdash;  he seemed bent on redeeming America of its shameful racist past, while Goldwater&rsquo;s puritanical libertarianism precluded his even supporting the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society grandly advertised a new American racial innocence. If it utterly failed to &#8220;end poverty in our time,&#8221; it succeeded  &mdash;  through a great display of generosity toward minorities and the poor  &mdash;  in recovering enough moral authority to see the government through the inexorable challenges of the &rsquo;60s.</p>
<p>When redemption became a term of power, &#8220;redemptive liberalism&#8221; was born  &mdash;  a new activist liberalism that gave itself a &#8220;redemptive&#8221; profile by focusing on social engineering rather than liberalism&rsquo;s classic focus on individual freedom. In the &rsquo;60s there was no time to allow individual freedom to render up the social good. Redemptive liberalism would proactively engineer the good. Name a good like &#8220;integration,&#8221; and then engineer it into being through a draconian regimen of school busing. If the busing did profound damage to public education in America, it gave liberals the right to say, &#8220;At least we did something!&#8221; In other words, we are activists against America&rsquo;s old sin of segregation. Activism is moral authority in redemptive liberalism.</p>
<p>But conservatism sees moral authority more in a discipline of principles than in activism. It sees ideas of the good like &#8220;diversity&#8221; as mere pretext for the social engineering that always leads to unintended and oppressive consequences. Conservatism would enforce the principles that ensure individual freedom, and then allow &#8220;the good&#8221; to happen by &#8220;invisible hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here is conservatism&rsquo;s great problem with minorities. In an era when even failed moral activism is redemptive  &mdash;  and thus a source of moral authority and power  &mdash;  conservatism stands flat-footed with only discipline to offer. {snip}</p>
<p>Added to this, American minorities of color  &mdash;  especially blacks  &mdash;  are often born into grievance-focused identities. The idea of grievance will seem to define them in some eternal way, and it will link them atavistically to a community of loved ones. {snip} Today the feeling of being aggrieved by American bigotry is far more a matter of identity than of actual aggrievement.</p>
<p>And this identity calls minorities to an anticonservative orientation to American politics. It makes for an almost ancestral resistance to conservatism. One&rsquo;s identity of grievance is flattered by the moral activism of the left and offended by the invisible hand of the right. Minorities feel they were saved from oppression by the left&rsquo;s activism, not by the right&rsquo;s discipline. The truth doesn&rsquo;t matter much here (in fact it took both activism and principle, civil war and social movement, to end this oppression). But activism indicates moral anguish in whites, and so it constitutes the witness minorities crave. They feel seen, understood. With the invisible hand the special case of their suffering doesn&rsquo;t count for much, and they go without witness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The first impulse is to moderate. With &#8220;compassionate conservatism&#8221; and &#8220;affirmative access&#8221; and &#8220;faith-based initiatives,&#8221; President George W. Bush tried to show a redemptive conservatism that could be activist against the legacy of America&rsquo;s disgraceful past. And it worked electorally by moderating the image of conservatives as uncaring disciplinarians. But in the end it was only a marketer&rsquo;s ploy  &mdash;  a shrewd advertisement with no actual product to sell.</p>
<p>What drew me to conservatism years ago was the fact that it gave discipline a slightly higher status than virtue. This meant it could not be subverted by passing notions of the good. It could be above moral vanity. And so it made no special promises to me as a minority. It neglected me in every way except as a human being who wanted freedom. Until my encounter with conservatism I had only known the racial determinism of segregation on the one hand and of white liberalism on the other  &mdash;  two varieties of white supremacy in which I could only be dependent and inferior.</p>
<p>The appeal of conservatism is the mutuality it asserts between individual and political freedom, its beautiful idea of a free man in a free society. And it offers minorities the one thing they can never get from liberalism: human rather than racial dignity. {snip}</p>

			<p>The background to all of this is post-1965 immigration  policy which has flooded OUR AMERICA with millions of high fertility hispanics,muslims,asians,carribeans and africans. If post-1965 immgration policy continues, Native Born White Americans will no longer be able to determine  their future and their fate. The fate and future of Native Born White Americans will be completely in the hands of post-1965 hispanics,muslims,africans,asians and carribeans. This is manifestly ourageous. It is more outrageous that the Republican party has a black male head of the Republican party who demands that Native Born White Americans go along with their racial dispossession at the hands of high fertility post-1965 hispanics,africans,carribeans,asians and muslims. In effect Michael Steele is demanding that Native Born White Americans commit suicide within the borders of America. Steele and the Republican party have declared war on Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Here is what YOU all need to say to Michael Steele and the Republican party: a pro-White American party will fill the political vacum. And this pro-White political party(s) will call for the deportation of millions of illegal aliens,deportation of the mexican and central american fifth column element, the mass deportation of muslims,afro -carribeans., africans and asians. For otherwise, to allow these high fertility non-whites to stay will result in huge non-white voting block that will vote year in and year out for the continuation of post-1965 immigration that will reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>For Michael Steele:WE will fight back. What do you intend to do about it?</p>
<p>I think it is about time that Peter Brimelow declare himself a White Nationalist and transform vdare.com into  White Nationalist web site. What are you waitng for? The approval of the Republican party? It is one minute before midnight for Native Born White Americans. </p>

			<p>Shelby Steele has a good point in regards to white liberals and leftists.  They clearly see blacks as inferior and therefore have to constantly patronize and help them.  Many of them treat blacks as helpless little children who can&rsquo;t wipe their own behinds without white liberal help.</p>

			<p>I was very impressed with Steele&rsquo;s article when I read it in the WSJ today, and I underlined many sentences with which I agreed.  The only thing missing is an acknowledgment of the loss of white racial unity, thanks to the liberal approach.  I am all for &#8220;human dignity&#8221; of conversatives over affected black dignity offered by liberals - but so too am I in favor of racial dignity for blacks AND whites (and others). </p>

			<p>Well, as is expected, Comrade Steele both makes and misses his own points when he notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is conservatism&rsquo;s great problem with minorities. In an era when even failed moral activism is redemptive &mdash; and thus a source of moral authority and power &mdash; conservatism stands flat-footed with only discipline to offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>Multicultural &#8220;&#8216;conservatism&rsquo; stands flat-footed,&#8221; not because of the &#8220;discipline&#8221; it offers toward minorities, but its lack of it. What this Red fool calls a: &#8220;long mistreatment of blacks and other minorities,&#8221; was apparently not a selective or disciplined enough form of Apartheid, to have done much good in the long run. Worse still, is any attempts to modify it to a more &#8220;kinder&#8221; or &#8220;gentler&#8221; form, since it has equally failed and allowed for the &#8220;grievance-focused identities&#8221; of &#8220;American minorities of color &mdash; especially blacks,&#8221; to be deified as acceptable &#8220;redemptive liberalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Particularly, if it comes at the expense of whites who are not in the parochially &#8220;redemptive&#8221; liberal/conservative, &#8220;white power elite.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Think about that, think about that really hard and ask yourself: &#8216;if it is wrong for a white power minority to &#8220;oppress&#8221; a nonwhite majority in a country like South Africa, why is it so &#8220;good&#8221; in majority white countries for minority &#8220;power elite&#8221; whites to do the same for alien nonwhite minority interests?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The answer is, it isn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

			<p>Toronto once used to be known as &#8216;Toronto the Good&rsquo;. It was a staunchly conservative city back in the 1940s and 50s. Then the federal Liberal party decided to break the Conservative political stranglehold on Canada&rsquo;s biggest city by encouraging mass third world immigration. Today, you couldn&rsquo;t get elected as a Conservative in the Toronto area (home to so many third-world immigrants and refugees) if you were Gandhi himself. In Canadian federal elections, the only drama in Toronto is whether the Liberals or the socialist NDP will win a certain riding.</p>

			<p>No long explanation needed, Mr. Steele.  No matter how left wing and pro-welfare a Republican can get, the Democrats will always be more left wing and pro-welfare.  Therefore, the Democrats will always get almost all of the black vote and a big majority of the Hispanic vote.  Republicans moving left only gives Democrats permission to go further left.</p>
<p>In terms of political calculus, Republicans out to realize that they can take the black and Hispanic vote for granted, and by &#8220;for granted,&#8221; I mean they won&rsquo;t get much of either.  Being increasingly more pro-white and economic populist won&rsquo;t cost them the black and Hispanic votes they won&rsquo;t get anyway, but it&rsquo;ll finally get them rust belt whites.</p>

			<p>Today&rsquo;s Republican Party licks the bottoms of minorities shoes, quite openly and proudly. I will never vote for a Republican again or give them one dime as long as they cater to Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims. They GOP has sank to the level of Democrats. </p>
<p>Never again.<br>

			<p>It&rsquo;s articles like this that make me realize that conservatism is not the way the go in preserving White America.  I used to equate it with a watered down type of White Nationalism but it&rsquo;s nothing of the sort.  Most conservatives believe that race is unimportant and that it&rsquo;s ok if Shaquil and Latrina are living next door to you as long as they maintain their yard, go to church and keep tight reigns on their children.  Never mind the fact that they work in a government job and got their positions through affirmative action. We&rsquo;ve got maybe 20 years before we become a minority and we need to dump this worthless ideology.  We don&rsquo;t want to conserve, we want to restore!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m probably similar to &#8216;blacks and hispanics&rsquo; like this, yet I usually vote right. I&rsquo;m down the middle, but when it comes to these issues of the heart, they just override the other feelings I have. To make these people conservative, and to bring back some conservative values, it will take whites trying to make changes, whites upset at discrimination, and whites protesting against hate crime. In other words they need us. <br>

			<p>Where to start? As some here may know I do mention Family a lot in my posts.  And I mean Family as an Institution (that would be a good question on a college exam, ie; &#8220;How many many Institutions are there in a Civilization?  Name them.&#8221;).<br>
My basic proposition is that Family Systems Psychology is enormously useful in helping us understand Society, Culture, and History, since Family Systems is itself a deposit of Cultural History, ie; it didn&rsquo;t just come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>In dealing with people who have suffered terribly in their family the hardest thing to get them to accept is that 1 - they will never fully recover and what recovery they have has to be won daily, and, 2 - they will probably never get justice from their primary offenders (a cruel fate, since those offenders were supposed to be their primary caretakers).<br>
They have to do more work in understanding their offenders and working toward forgiveness than their offenders will ever do in even admitting what they did, let alone hold themselves accountable and make amends. In short, these are the REAL victims of society who are actively working toward NOT being victims, so they can live as full a life as possible. They have a story to tell and are worth listening to.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have to do any of this. In fact, as everyone here knows, we&rsquo;ve created a society where blacks don&rsquo;t have to do much of anything, the Whites do.  And what they do they have to do for blacks.  Blacks, of course, so goes the culture&rsquo;s &#8220;logic&#8221;, get the credit for &#8220;overcoming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fact is, the West is the ONLY place in the world that has any notion of - DEVELOPING CONSCIOUSNESS and CONSCIENCE.</p>
<p>It is this that made us aware that beating your children is bad; that overwhelming them with ridicule, sarcasm, shame and blame is bad, and, from the perspective of both family and society, counterproductive, hateful, and stupid.  <br>
And, of course, it was this developing conscience that made us aware that Slavery was bad. That slavery was bad is something we obsess over; that we came to that awareness as a result of a developing consciousness and conscience found ONLY in the West is something seldom mentioned, if at all.<br>
Sadly, we focus far more on Blacks and Slavery than we do on Family and Abuse of its children and the effect on Society, particularly White society.</p>
<p>Regardless, Westerners are the ONLY ones who have ever thought this way and that shift in our thinking comes from White men ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
There is NO WAY to soft soap this! Not without lying!<br>
Or, to put it delicately, not without misrepresenting the facts.<br>
And Steele does that with this line&hellip;<br>
&#8220;Societies have moral accountability&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh really?  WHAT Societies. Societies, plural?  Maybe there&rsquo;s a reason he didn&rsquo;t follow that up with examples!  There aren&rsquo;t any! There is only one! And this is a FACT that he couldn&rsquo;t mention without reducing his entire argument to rubble.<br>
So, here is the critical point.  At the moment it &#8220;fessed up&#8221; it was THE Moral Authority.<br>
It&rsquo;s confession was a sign of its moral authority, of course!<br>
As Dostoyevsky said, &#8220;The only way to rejoin Humanity is to confess!&#8221; What other demographic confesses, to anything????<br>
You can not name one!!!!<br>
What happened was, well, look - LOOK - at who was doing all of the judging!!!  A bunch of historically illiterate, or worse, historically semi-literate, adolescents who themselves were the beneficiaries of something that took centuries to procure and provide! They were not armed with the truth. They came armed with Radical Ingratitude and Absurd Self-Righteuosness. <br>
Their protests were based on a gross misrepresentation, and oversimplification of the facts! And that is why so much of what they said was based on a soft foundation of sentimentality and self-righteousness. You can not build anything, much less a society or culture on Sentimentality, Self-Righteousness, Lies, Misrepresentations and Chronic Complaining! Yet, this is, morally and intellectually, all the Power Elite today seems to have. And that is why our society is dying.<br>
I consider this an opportunity! Provided we accept the all important fact that the key word that serves like a rock tied around the neck of the Political Left and Right for the last 200 years is the one NO society can be built on. In fact, it is THE lesson of Cultural History that ONLY the West has figured out (though admittedly just a few of its members). And that word is - Redemption! NO society can EVER be redeemed, ever. If there was such a thing as Final Redemption (and that is what they are talking about) then there would be no point in DEVELOPMENT of the Consciousness and Conscience.</p>

			<p>(I think it began in a very specific cultural circumstance:<br>
 the dramatic loss of moral authority that America suffered <br>

of blacks and other minorities.)</p>
<p> I beg to differ with this opinion. America has done no <br>
greater compared to any non-White nation. Does anyone <br>
seriously think the blacks of Zimbabwe will have<br>
a guilt fest 20-30 years down the road. In regards to<br>
the ethnic cleansing of White in Zimbabwe ? How about<br>
South African blacks, will they cry into kleenexes <br>
about their treatment of Afrikaners ? The dramatic <br>
loss of moral authority happened when America cast <br>
aside it&rsquo;s White founding stock. The loss of moral <br>
authority happened when the government of the now <br>
U.S.S.A, decided to mistreat it&rsquo;s White population, <br>
while coddling without fault any non-White. And the<br>
great loss of moral authority happened when common<br>
sense was replaced with Liberal/Marxism.</p>

			<p>Interesting comments.</p>
<p>I continue to maintain that:</p>
<p>1) this is not a l/r isue at all, but on of the physical survival in our own lands of the European race.</p>
<p>2) Europeans are ready for the truth, but it must be kept SEPARATE from a huge laundry list of irrelevant claptrap like climate change denial or Republican Party platform items.</p>
<p>3) The truth is we are going to die out if we don&rsquo;t reproduce, and will spend our last days as minorities in new and strange societies if we don&rsquo;t claim control our own territories and expel aliens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again: not a l/r issue at all, but an EXISTENTIAL ONE; and most Europeans (I&rsquo;m an American living in Europe) would like to expel the Muslim hordes in order to PRESERVE European social democracy, a secular, tolerant, high-tech, live and let live society where railing against gay marriage gets you a shrug, and mention of &#8220;Creationism&#8221; gets you an condescending smile. </p>
<p>The only people in Europe who hate gays and think women should be second class citizens are the Muslims.</p>
<p>If we can separate essential from inessential and focus on the existential issue of our physical survival, we can build a majority movement of Europeans wordwide that is neither left for right. </p>

			<p>And do no think for one minute that the Taki.com cabal is offering a serious alternative to the Republican party.  White Nationalist have been banned over at Taki.com and have been replaced with the asian supremacist Razib Khan who is an advocate of destroying a Native Born White Ameican tech workforce and replacing it with asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS and its &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline. </p>
<p>White Nationlaism is the only alternative to the Republican party.</p>

			<p>As a proud white person, I feel no need to redeem my race for slavery and segregation.  The African in America lives better now than any other Black African in world history.  In historical terms, even as slaves, the African lived better in America in, say, 1800 than in any other place in the world.</p>
<p>Shelby Steele, like all other blacks, want the white man to shower contempt for their own race and history.  This we can never do.  The white man has a proud and glorious history that should be defended at al costs.</p>

The Republican &#8216;Hispanic Strategy&rsquo; is a dead end.</p>
<p>It began with Ronald Reagan and anti-Cuban &#8216;refugees&rsquo; in Miami.</p>
<p>Reagan took a tough stand against Castro and Miamis&rsquo; Cuban &#8216;refugees&rsquo; loved him. However, that movement was short-lived, over, it&rsquo;s not coming back, and it doesn&rsquo;t resonate with younger &#8216;Cubans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The other Reagan &#8216;Hispanic Strategy&rsquo; was the <b>ONE TIME ONLY</b> amnesty which critics rightly pointed out at the time would result in Mexicans flooding into the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for conservative Republicans to abandon their pandering to Hispanics.</p>

<p>Militant feminism and homosexuality are sicknesses partially responsible for killing off the White race and your asking people to embrace them?  I&rsquo;m not making any excuses for muslims but I suspect some Europeans feel their presence could put a real dent in the perverted lifestyles some of them live.  I was on a train bound for Nice France a few years back and noticed this repulsive type of behavior between two &#8220;couples&#8221;.  Don&rsquo;t try to tell me other Europeans don&rsquo;t care because they do, especially families. I don&rsquo;t wish any harm on anyone but after viewing this spectacle I understand why muslims are attacking people in the subways, streets, etc.  It&rsquo;s a sign of a degenerate society that has been allowed to flourish in the name of tolerance.      <br>

			<p>Steele (michael and shelby) along with Holder and Obama also represent the afromarxist black separatist ideology of modern politics. They use the stick of slavery to beat on America for special favors. Worse they are sanctimonious, and like Obama, not in any sense American.</p>

<p>The destabilization of Cuba by both Republican and Democratic adminstrations is inseparable form the massice influx of Cubans into Miami. Or to put it another way, the Cold War is inseparable from the hispanic invasion of America.</p>
<p>Cuba never did pose a threat to America. It still doesn&rsquo;t. The United States could have lived in peace with Cuba. The attacks on cuba brought the human species within 60 seconds of nuclear annihilation!!!!  back in Oct 1962. Cold Warrior JFK-the man who would have been responsible for starting nuclear WW3 back in 1962- wrote book back in 1953 arguing for that America was to White.</p>
<p>The Cuban congressmen and congresswomen  who represent the cuba nationals who live in Miami in the United States congress are some of the worst open borders hispanic colonizers in the US congress.</p>
<p>The Cubans should never have been let into OUR America. You seem to think that the pre-1980 cubans should hve been allowed into OUR AMREICA. The pre-1980 cubans are the worst. They have been a powerfull foirce in the congres for open borders immigration. Cuban Miami is a decadent  and violent place. The cubans who ran miaimi for years are a mafia  that has receieved enormous freebies form OUR GOVERMENT.</p>
<p>I blame Native Born White Cold Warriors such as yourself for the death of Native Born White America.</p>

			<p>The only people in Europe who hate gays and think women should be second class citizens are the Muslims.</p>

<p>The claim that Muslims are the only ones is false&hellip;.White men hating feminist think worse of women especially those who have children.<br>

<p><i>&#8220;You seem to think that the pre-1980 cubans should hve been allowed into OUR AMREICA.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I neither said, nor believe any such thing.</p>
<p>My comments were about the ORGINGS of the Republican Hispanic strategy. I didn&rsquo;t say or imply I agreed with the strategy. I was only giving people the history and background.</p>
<p>This was nothing but a shameless pandering to a small but loudmouth group of malcontents.</p>
<p>Reagan made a double deal with the devil. First with the Cuban &#8216;Americans&rsquo; and then with the one-time-only amnesty.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t support either then (especially the one-time-only amnesty) and I believe most of us here see what these bargains have cost us.</p>
<p>The Republican party seems intent on keeping this failed strategy alive and we all know how bad for us it&rsquo;s going to get.<br>
