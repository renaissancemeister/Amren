<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California&rsquo;s controversial 1996 voter initiative, banning affirmative action in education, public hiring or contracting, known as Proposition 209, is again under court scrutiny.</p>
<p>On March 17 a state appeals court approved the Berkeley school district&rsquo;s voluntary integration plan, concluding that it&rsquo;s [sic] unique plan to consider the racial makeup of a neighborhood, rather than individual students, does not violate the terms of Prop. 209.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision in the Berkeley case is the first time a state appellate court has approved a school district integration plan since voters approved Prop. 209 nearly 13 years ago. American Civil Rights Foundation v. Berkeley Unified School Dist., A121137 (Calif. 1st Dist. Court of Appeal)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important victory for those who understand the importance of a diverse learning environment and believe that opportunity should be equally afforded to all,&#8221; according to John Payton, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Berkeley devised an integration point system that rated small neighborhood areas in the 9,000-student district by racial composition, parents&rsquo; income and education levels. The district establishes scores for each neighborhood and makes enrollment decisions based on the ratings. But it does not take into account the race of an individual student in making assignments.</p>

<p>Race is and is not taken into account, at the same time.  I think it does violate 209, but the question is are there any honest judges left in California.</p>

			<p>Make no mistake, Berkelely has been discrimminating against Whites in its admission practices all along.  Ironically, Asians are heavily discriminated against as well, because they have the tenacity to actually show up qualified to attend Berkeley.  Berkeley has difficulty attracting qualified minority students like Florida has difficulty attracting sea shells.  It&rsquo;s admitting the right kind of diversity (i.e. Blacks and Hispanics), often at the expense of California law, that Berkeley is having problems with. Without racial preferences there would scarcely be any Blacks attending Berkeley at all, and far fewer Hispanics.  But the social engineers at Berkeley and the NAACP aren&rsquo;t satisfied with the current ratio of undeserving AA student to legitimate student, so they are scrambling to find ways of undermining academic integrity and California law even more.</p>
<p>I can remember all too well the benefits of the &#8220;diverse&#8221; learning environment I received while at college.  It mostly consisted of Blacks congregating in the university square like a street gang, muttering scarcely articulable vulgarities among one another.  It was only the random Black, often a native African or foreigner, with the inclination or intelligence to mix with Whites.  Though parents can rest assured that their 18 year-old daughter will be hit on by Blacks incessantly for the duration of their diverse college experience.  Yes, an even more &#8220;diverse&#8221; learning environment will indubitably be a boon to higher-education in the state of California.</p>

			<p>Finding away around proposition 209 is easy, since in California, the Democratic Party Dictatorship, does nothing but pander to their &#8220;protected classes&#8221;. Whether it&rsquo;s public contracts, entrance to universities, or public hiring, the Democrats have it all sewn up in California, and are just carrying out the &#8220;great society&#8221; program of favoring &#8220;protected classes&#8221;  &mdash;  anyone who isn&rsquo;t white. They will never be challenged by the minority cowardly and useless California Republicans.</p>
<p>In fact, two radio hosts in Southern California, John and Ken of the John and Ken Show, have started a campaign to recall certain Republican politicians in California, including Governor Schwarzenegger,  who recently allowed the Democrats to slap the citizenry with an absurd number of new taxes. The poinst I&rsquo;m making here is that the new taxes are for the purpose of allowing the Democrats to continue the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; program of the &#8220;protected classes&#8221; in California, which has come to include the millions of illegal aliens in the State. Yet, as I said on a previous post, millions of Americans still don&rsquo;t get it where illegal immigration is concerned. Those amnestied illegal aliens are going to go under the protected class umbrella, friends. I&rsquo;ll end this in John PM&rsquo;s usual way, &#8220;God help us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite what many people believe, they could give every black a college degree, but it would do anything but bring this country to ruin faster, which would cause the destruction of black neighborhoods and blacks much quicker than if it weren&rsquo;t in effect.</p>
<p>Blacks are their own worst enemies.</p>

<p>Everyone should be equally exposed to bullying, violence, child abuse, organized crime, and drugs!</p>
<p>Allowing children or parents to decide things for themselves is wrong!</p>

			<p>As an FYI, here is Berkeley&rsquo;s undergraduate numbers per Wikipedia.  Just another example of historical White privilage blocking &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; for other races.</p>
<p>African American 3% <br>
Asian American 42% <br>
White American 31% <br>
Hispanic American 12% <br>
Native American 
International student 3%</p>

			<p>From wikipedia about the University of North Dakota</p>
<p>&#8220;Demographically, about 90% of the student body is caucasian&#8221;. I would imagine the same numbers at NDSU, SDSU (South Dakota State U, not San Diego State). The weather may be beautiful in California, but what good is it if the rest of the state is unlivable. The cold has a tendency to keep out the riff-raff. Even though corporate recruiters at colleges tend to hang out more at the big name universities, I wonder how many would tell you privately over dinner that small and private colleges tend to produce a better quality student. At least they can make their affirmative action quota a Big State U. (Except in the engineering department - unless you can qualify Indians as black due to their skin color.)  </p>
<p>Berkeley has been a basket case for 40+ years. </p>

			<p>Whatever the affirmative nonsense is California (or anyplace) rest assure it&rsquo;s bleeding heart whites and vote buying white politicians, not blacks, that are mostly responsible. Can you imagine any other race whose hearts would bleed for some less capable group among them, especially when that group commits disproportionately many violent crimes against it while complaining about racism? Only whites - makes on think it could be a genetic defect in the white race.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Despite what many people believe, they could give every black a college degree, but it would do anything but bring this country to ruin faster, which would cause the destruction of black neighborhoods and blacks much quicker than if it weren&rsquo;t in effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, the idea that EVERYONE (including blacks) deserves an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to get an undergraduate degree has completely devalued undergraduate education.  For most &#8220;students&#8221;, it is simply the last phase of adolescence, taking the place of what high school used to provide.  In political terms, it&rsquo;s four more years of liberal brainwashing that you have to pay for and endure without learning any real-world skills.</p>
<p>If you look at the European model, higher education is free (paid by the state) but there are very rigorous standards for admission.  It is not accepted as a given that &#8220;everyone&#8221; gets to go to college.  A college degree means something, and usually prepares you directly for a job in your field of study.  If you look at most &#8220;universities&#8221; in America today, they exist only as day-care programs to host debauchery and foster a liberal way of thinking.</p>

			<p>California politics remains destructively perverse. The good news is those who govern there will have bankrupted the state within the next three years, and even California&rsquo;s halfwit leftist voters will be eager to dump every incumbent they can target into the crowded unemployment line. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is no matter what they are trying to get students in who are not as academically talented as many students that they are trying to exclude for the sake of socially engineering the future.  The people in charge are determined to permanantly change the world.  There is a lot at stake and they will stop at nothing to accomplish their goals.  From the television programming we watch to how were programmed in our schools to who&rsquo;s allowed into schools.  There is no doubt that diversity has the effect of weakening White America politically and culturally so that White America becomes diminished. White America seems to afraid and to stupid to come together fast enough and have a voice.  Some national newscasters or talk show hosts might come out and call us racist.</p>

			<p>A diverse learning environment is not a necessity or even inherently good. At any rate, we cannot claim that everyone should have equal access, then give special favors to minorities, despite what the NAACP says.</p>
