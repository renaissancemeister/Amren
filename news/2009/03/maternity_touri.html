<h1><a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/598731">&#8216;Maternity Tourism&rsquo; Leaves MDs Footing Bill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Press, March 09, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Quebec doctors say there&rsquo;s been a rise in &#8220;maternity tourism&#8221; over the last year and they&rsquo;re upset because some foreigners don&rsquo;t pay their hospital bill.</p>
<p>Several Montreal hospitals have noticed an increase in the number of pregnant foreign women, predominantly from French-speaking countries, who travel to Canada to give birth, according to the Quebec Federation of Medical Specialists.</p>
<p>According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, any person born in Canada who isn&rsquo;t a child of a diplomat becomes a citizen at birth.</p>
<p>Anecdotal figures from Sainte-Justine Hospital, St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital and Saint-Luc Hospital suggest more than 125 foreigners delivered babies in Montreal last year. Statistics obtained by The Canadian Press from the Canadian Institute for Health Information show that in 2005-2006, 273 babies were delivered in Quebec to foreign mothers, compared with 169 in the rest of the country. Ontario had the second-highest number of infants born to non-Canadian residents with 91.</p>
<p>As with any emergency service, salaried staff don&rsquo;t lose out if a patient can&rsquo;t pay, argued Gaétan Barrette of the Quebec Federation of Medical Specialists. Each labour and delivery costs the health-care system between $5,000 and $7,000.</p>
<p>Doctors, however, are self-employed and lose about $400 each time a pregnant foreigner doesn&rsquo;t pay. He&rsquo;s calling on the Quebec government to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>In a recent radio interview, Citizenship and Immigration Canada Minister Jason Kenney said he&rsquo;s asked his staff to check numbers before he decides whether to act.<br>

			<p>French-speaking countries?  You mean like Haiti?</p>

			<p>Like in the U.S., these laws were passed when whites were the majority population and the majority of visitors.  Now we&rsquo;re both getting badly bitten.  Just like welfare and many other social programs which tend to be less abused by whites.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Anchor babies come to Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait till they take over the emergency rooms, the welfare rolls, the schools, and start rioting against blacks.  Only then will the Canadians what having fun really means.</p>
<p>I have a hunch they just might want to reconsider their maniacal support for multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>The doctor may not get paid, but I bet they&rsquo;d sue him quick enough if something went wrong. </p>

			<p>This law is the prime example of the best way to kill a nation. The invasion from the south brings women who can step across the border, give birth on the US side and produce an American citizen who will then be able to import 50 of their closest relatives who will be a drag on the economy and culture for the rest of their lives. How easy it must be to decide to simply walk in, have an heir and sign up for lifelong benefits. Washington has lost its collective mind. This should have been the first travesty to be eliminated. The 14th amendment is a misguided interpretation of a law meant to be enacted for the elimination of slavery, not for free-wheeling illegal aliens. They&rsquo;re set for life if they can produce an anchor baby. Call your represntatives and let them know that this needs to be stopped. Then go from there, reducing benefits, until every last illegal is out of this country. It&rsquo;s time Mexico and other countries lose their sense of entitlement. And high time that our &#8220;politicians&#8221; (excuse my language) start thinking of us instead of the criminals.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t have to &#8216;wait&rsquo;. Most Canadian urban centres are already becoming majority non-white. Old stock Canadians are not welcome in many places across the land that their ancestors cleared and settled. </p>
