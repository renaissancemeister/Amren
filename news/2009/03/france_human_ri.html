<h1><a href="https://islamineurope.blogspot.com/2009/03/france-human-rights-organization-sues.html">France: Human Rights Organization Sues Wilders</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AD (Netherlands), March 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A French human rights organization is summoning Geert Wilders to court. The head of the PVV party is accused of inciting to hatred of Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilders made statements about French Muslims, about Muslims in Paris and Marseilles, which incite to racial hatred,&#8221; says lawyer Yassine Bouzrou. He lodged the complaint on behalf of the organization, which is being studied by the public prosecution. If Wilders is found guilty, he can be sentenced for one year in prison.</p>
<p>Wilders was not aware of the complaint yesterday evening. &#8220;I hear this for the the first time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The wold is becoming small with trials and procedures everywhere: from the Netherlands, Jordan and England to France. Dreadful. But I&rsquo;ll naturally fight back judicially. They won&rsquo;t prevail over me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week the PVV head signed an official appeal against the UK&rsquo;s refusal to let him into the country.</p>
<p>The French complaint is based on Wilders&rsquo; speech in New York last September. &#8220;Paris is now surrounded by a ring of Muslim neighborhoods,&#8221; he said then. &#8220;Many neighbourhoods in France are no-go areas for women without head scarves.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called the riots in the suburbs in 2005 a &#8220;Muslim intifada&#8221;. Bouzrou came to the conclusion that the expressions are criminal. &#8220;Wilders says in that speech also that one in three French Muslims supports suicide attacks. With that he suggests that one in three French Muslims is a potential terrorist. Where he does he get all of this? How did he get ot it? Wilders makes serious accusations which are based on nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bouzrou made the complaint for the French human rights organization ADDH. They work together with the Collective against Islamophobia in the fight against Muslim hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;A politician may express his idea. But Wilders makes dangerous statements about something of which he has no understanding. These are not political ideas, but insults and prejudices,&#8221; says the lawyer. &#8220;We already had in France attacks on mosques and against Muslim cemeteries. The statements by Wilders instigate further extremism against Muslims.&#8221;<br>

			<p>This is a bit hard to understand how the world got so weird. Here he makes these comments in the U.S., where it is still not a crime to exercise one&rsquo;s right to free speech, and he is a Dutch citizen, living in Holland, then some third country comes in here and wants to charge him with a crime for what he said. What happened to sanity??</p>

			<p>So Muslims in France are suing a poltician from Holland over a speech he gave in New York?</p>
<p>First they clog up the criminal courts, now they clog up the civil courts w/frivoluos lawsuits. </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that the word &#8220;Dhimmitude&#8221; is imported from the French language. </p>
<p>Mind you, it makes sense, as ze Fwench have always wet their panties at the thought of being conquered peoples living under Muslim rule.</p>

<p>Very disturbing. </p>
<p>Is stating the truth now considered a criminal offence in France?  These are nothing more than statements of FACT! </p>
<p>An additional point to note is that you can now be sued by some &#8220;offended&#8221; party  in France for something you said  in New York!   This is where our new one-world government is taking us.<br>

			<p>Of course the truth is no defence.  It will be dropped though.  This is absurd by even european standards.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see. Muslims torch thousands of automobiles all over France, beat people up on trains, chant &#8220;death to infidels&#8221;, in France, and they blame Geert Wilders, for &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes.</p>

Perhaps it will [be dropped], right now.  But they are probing to see how far they can go. This is ominous.</p>
<p>It is very worrysome to think that you could be sued by some &#8220;offended&#8221; person in Bangla Desh for something that you said in Chicago.  This madness has GOT to be stopped! </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take note the the UN is presently working on making criticism of &#8220;religion&#8221; a crime. That veiled term means Islam, of course&hellip; what else? The ones who are perpetually offended.</p>

			<p>Well at least Westerners should be thankful that invading Muslim colonists in our Western nations have learned to go the shyster lawyer nuicance suit route instead of always just rioting and resorting to violence everytime some Westerner makes the wild charge that Muslims are violent.</p>
<p>Repeat after me:</p>
<p>Muslims are not violent.<br>
Islam is a religion of peace</p>
<p>And if you say or even think the thought that some Muslims are violent, then mobs of Muslims will take to our streets and engage in extreme violence and it will be all our vault.</p>
<p>Islam isn&rsquo;t violent and mass Muslim migration is good for Europe, good for the West, Diversity is our strength.</p>
<p>Now everyone should pay the Jizya tax (tax on non Muslims living in Muslim controlled lands) of which the traitorous PC Multi cult Europe elites take their cut.</p>
<p>Please spread this great video which explains the ways Islamic invaders are hi-jacking the PC hate speech laws:</p>
