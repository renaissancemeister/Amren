<h1>Group Grows Its Political Voice</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Josar, Detroit News, March 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a city rife with apathy, the fruit-throwing, &#8220;Sambo Sell Out&#8221; award-giving Call &rsquo;Em Out Coalition has emerged as a potent  &mdash;  if divisive  &mdash;  political force.</p>
<p>Members take credit for rallying opposition to the plan to transfer ownership of Cobo Center to a regional authority. They&rsquo;re pushing City Council President Monica Conyers to launch a write-in campaign for mayor; and they&rsquo;re leading the charge against selling more city assets, such as a Detroit Water and Sewerage Department interceptor.</p>
<p>The grassroots group that hurled Oreos at former Mayor Dennis Archer and distributed doctored photos of Councilman Kwame Kenyatta eating watermelon is nothing if not controversial. But even its critics concede the group, which claims some 2,000 members, is effective.</p>
<p>&#8220;They go too far sometimes,&#8221; said Jai Lee Dearing, a 2005 council candidate who is considering another run this year. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to hear what you want to say. They only want you to hear what they say. But nobody wants them against them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s founder and chief agitator is Agnes Hitchcock, 63, a onetime trainer of mechanics who now lives off Social Security disability payments because of carbon monoxide poisoning. She gained notoriety in 2007 when she was fined $250 for throwing red grapes at school board members during a testy meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About two weeks before the council&rsquo;s vote in late February, Call &rsquo;Em Out members began phoning council members, and Hitchcock urged listeners of her TV and radio show to flood the council. Soon, mainstream voices such as radio host Mildred Gaddis and then-mayoral candidate Freman Hendrix spoke out against the plan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Call &rsquo;Em Out has partnered with labor unions and other grassroots movements to fight charter schools and reduce water rate increases. It works with the community organization ACORN to co-host sessions about avoiding foreclosures and joined the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization in urging former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to resign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The award  &mdash;  and the racially charged image of Kenyatta  &mdash;  prompted Internet service provider AOL to restrict Call &rsquo;Em Out&rsquo;s account, requiring members to go through extra steps before messages are sent. Members also have been accused of tossing thumbtacks on the floor during school board meetings and launched numerous, unsuccessful recall petitions against council members, school board members and Archer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group known for protests and harassment campaigns has a mixed track record. Among its accomplishments is killing a plan in the early 2000s by philanthropist Bob Thompson, who wanted to donate $200 million to help build 15 charter schools in Detroit with Bing and the Skillman Foundation. Among its failures is a recall petition aimed at Councilwoman Sheila Cockrel and the late Councilwoman Brenda Scott, who were targeted on claims they pushed budget cuts that reduced city bus service.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no definite agenda except to cause trouble,&#8221; said Reverend David Murray, a Detroit Public Schools board member and former recipient of the Sambo award. &#8220;Do I think they&rsquo;re effective? I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re extremely weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political consultant Steve Hood [says,] &#8220;No one else is speaking up, and they have the loud voice that is filling that void,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>This group or its members and leaders probably have a vested financial interest in what they are against.  For instance, a black radio talk show host in St. Louis, Lizz Brown, started an ad hoc organization about five or six years ago called &#8220;The Community.&#8221;  Its purpose was to oppose a Missouri state takeover of the St. Louis City Public Schools.  She had every excuse in the book for opposing the takeover, especially &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Come to find out, a white somewhat liberal reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch did some digging and found out that Lizz Brown had an advertising contract with the City School System, agreed to by the elected school board, and a state takeover would have meant a board run by the state which would have revoked the contract.  It was all personal on her part.</p>
<p>One of the painful lessons I have had to absorb as I get older (32 at the end of this month) is that people aren&rsquo;t that cerebral or complex, the motivations for what people do are depressingly simple.  For Lizz Brown, it was money in her pocket.  For this group in Detroit, I bet it&rsquo;s something similar.</p>

&ldquo;Sambo Sell Out&#8221;. Translation: Not Black Enough.</p>
<p>Blacks have long contented that their problems were in part caused by their &#8216;exclusion&rsquo; from political power and decision making.</p>
<p>Now blacks have black mayor, black police chiefs, black firemen, black representative, black teacher/principals/administrator etc. and yet their condition remains the same.</p>
<p>The problem, as these people see it, is that their black representatives aren&rsquo;t &#8216;black enough&rsquo;; meaning, now that blacks are in power, black people aren&rsquo;t doing what REALLY needs to be done to get get blacks TRUE power.</p>
<p>Blacks create their own problems simply being who and what they are. What works for whites doesn&rsquo;t work for them. What they believe will work for them won&rsquo;t because of who and what they are.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a nation in Africa or a neighborhood in America, blacks can&rsquo;t make western civilization work for them so they try to adopt black solutions which are just as bad or worse.</p>
<p>These people can&rsquo;t be helped by us or by their own.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, the best way to destroy blacks is to give them what they want. The fact that once they gain power and their condition deteriorates further and they blame &#8216;Sambo sell-outs&rsquo; is just an example of this.</p>

			<p>Let them reap what they sow. If they drive all outside investment away from Detroit then the better for the rest of the nation as the money will go elsewhere. If the people of Detroit want to live in a backwards crumbling city, then the more power to them. </p>

			<p> &#8220;Throwing grapes&#8221; -from article   I walked out from my girlfriend watching &#8220;Milk&#8221; when the inevitable in your face scenes came on. Went in and googled Anita Bryant. Interesting&hellip;. Miss America, first runner up. Hit songs, &#8220;Paper Roses&#8221; (later taken to No. 1 by Marie Osmond)and &#8220;My Little Corner of The World.&#8221; And thanks to the Gay movement  she was the first person in modern history to be &#8220;pied&#8221; as an act of political anger or activism. <br>
  So I watched the video. Pretty heartbreaking&hellip;.The throwee kept in in his hand and   hit her with the force of a  sucker punch. The look of shock and humiliation on her face was hard to witness thirty years on. Probably why it caught on&hellip; It seemed like her husband saw it coming and ducked out of the way, letting her get whacked. Could  it be why they got divorced?<br>
 Which led to the collapse of her Christian base and continuing financial troubles. One moment in time I had forgotten having lived through. She had hired Irish dancers for her theme park or whatever. When the checks bounced, they were stranded for a month living off hotel and supermarket charity. It made headlines daily in the national mass  media, till contributors raised money for airfare home. Ouch!! <br>
  Anyway, lest you misconstrue my musings, I came away with a greater appreciation for the lady and her beauty and talent. The most eerie thing was her 1978 prediction that in thirty years time it would be  Christianity that  would be outlawed if a line wasn`t drawn. Then the author of the article reminded the reader of the Baptists in Phillie or where ever&hellip;</p>

<p>What a crock.  </p>
<p>The poisoning apparently resulted in brain damage.  Just look at the photo.  The epitome of a head bobbing, finger wagging, &#8220;mad black woman&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine if an organized group of whites threw Oreos or distributed doctored photos of Kwame eating watermelon?   What a bunch of hyperimpulsive hypocrites.</p>

			<p>Just the fact that she gets SSI for &#8220;carbon monoxide poisoning&#8221; tells you where this lady&rsquo;s mental capacity is. Why would anyone want to prevent charter schools? Even low testing and low performing black students tend to do better when they are in this environment. </p>

			<p>Just about nothing is worse in the Black community than being called a sell-out or an oreo, nothing.  The first time I was called one, I felt like someone had run a huge gladiator sword through my chest.  I&rsquo;d rather be called the n-word and deal with some typical whitey rant about how wonderful they are a thousand times over.</p>

			<p>Detroit, a place I&rsquo;m very familiar with, has been black-ruled for over 40 years now, and it has gone completely third-world.  I now firmly believe that blacks prefer to live in this environment. Unless their &#8220;communties&#8221; look like Haiti, they truly aren&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<p>Blacks in even small groups are fundamentally ungovernable, and tribal leaders know that this makes them ripe for exploitation in the way of nearly endless government funds and other unearned benefits.</p>
<p>When whites in power ultimately learn that the majority of blacks are hopelessly tribal as well as racist to the core, they just might stop funding the insanity.</p>

			<p>Ms. Hitchcock lives on disability from carbon monoxide poisoning. The permanent damage from exposure to excess levels of carbon monoxide is BRAIN DAMAGE. Nuff said</p>

			<p>Miss Hitchcock looks healthier and younger than most 63 year olds, yet she mooches off the taxpayers by claiming to be disabled by carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>Apparently her &#8220;disability&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t stop her from throwing fruit, thumbtacks and Oreo cookies at &#8220;uncle toms&#8221; (aka black people with jobs).</p>

			<p>I find it interesting that this &#8220;activist&#8221; and professional moocher receives SSI disability, because when I had my stroke and had a great deal of trouble getting around for over a year afterward (I was terribly weak down my left side, and was continually wrenching my ankle, which was more-or-less constantly swelled-up like a grapefruit) I was denied the TEMPORARY disability I requested.</p>
<p>I knew a disabled Vietnam vet ten years ago, who was shot in the lower back, which did a lot of damage.  He was medevaced, and the helicopter was shot down.  The resulting crash did even more damage to his back and knocked most of his teeth out.  He was getting only $500 a month as of 1998.</p>
<p>Moreover, if this woman actually received brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning (CO works exactly like cyanide; it bonds tightly to the iron in hemoglobin and prevents your blood from carrying oxygen), how would anyone be able to tell?  Doubtless she wasn&rsquo;t very bright to begin with.</p>
