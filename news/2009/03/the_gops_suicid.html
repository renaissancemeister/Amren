<p>The GOP&rsquo;s diminishing influence  &mdash;  clearly demonstrated by its greatly-reduced power in Washington  &mdash;  is the result of Republicans ignoring their traditional White European American base of support, while pursuing the traditional Democratic support base of non-White minorities. According to the PEW Research Center, White Americans will be a minority in the U.S. population by 2042. Instead of advocating and enacting policies that would prevent the decline of America&rsquo;s white population, the Republicans have decided to embrace the fateful change that has been underway since 1965, and has elevated Michael Steele to the Republican Party chairmanship.</p>
<p>Michael Steele could not have been elevated to the chairmanship without a racially diverse electorate. (In my book _Plain Truth_, I explain why such diversity makes political representation impossible.) While registered Republicans in all 50 states are predominantly white, U.S. territories which also vote on such matters are predominantly non-white. On the 6th ballot, Steele won by a final tally of 91-77. However, he won all 15 votes  &mdash;  one vote more than his margin of victory  &mdash;  from U.S. territories. Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, The Virgin Islands, and The Northern Marianas all held firmly for Steele. Thus, it was non-whites, that is, non-traditional Republicans that turned the Republican Party over to Michael Steele. {snip}</p>
<p>Chairman Steele is a non-traditional Republican not only racially and culturally, but he is also a non-traditional Republican ideologically. In addition to favoring affirmative action and opposing the death penalty, Steele is soft on the 2nd Amendment. {snip}</p>
<p>In addition to electing leaders who disagree with the traditional party platform, the Republican response to their 2008 debacle was an embarrassing attempt to beat the Democrats at their own game by tapping Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to delivery the Republican response to Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union Address. It was an ineffective, even comical attempt by the GOP to show that it, too, is racially diverse. It seems the Republicans are trying to recreate themselves in the image of the Democratic Party&rsquo;s notion of &#8220;diversity&#8221; by matching the Democrats minority-for-minority. But as recent history has proved, Republican efforts to reach out to minorities have not only been fruitless, but have also irritated an already disappointed base. During the 2000 election against Al Gore, then Governor George Bush made strong overtures to the NAACP. He said, &#8220;Discrimination is still a reality, even when it takes different forms. Instead of Jim Crow, there&rsquo;s racial redlining and profiling. Instead of separate but equal, there is separate and forgotten. Strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration.&#8221; Bush&rsquo;s rhetoric was for naught. In 2000, Gore won 90% of all Black votes while John Kerry received 88% four years later. Asians have become a more reliable voting bloc for the Democrats this decade. Gore received 55% while Kerry managed to earn 56%.&#8221; Despite Republicans betraying their base supporters to pursue minority voters, the perception will remain that Democrats champion the helpless little guy, and Republicans side with exploitative big business and greedy rich white men. No matter what Republicans promise during the campaigns or what they enact when they manage to get elected, they will never receive substantial support from minority voters.</p>
<p>The key demographic that both parties hope can give them a monopoly on power is the Hispanic population. However, the Democrats already possess a near insurmountable advantage. In addition to Democrats winning a plurality of Hispanic votes since becoming a significant portion of the voting pool in 1980, a poll conducted by the Latino Coalition before the 2008 election cycle stated that 61% of all Hispanic voters identify themselves as Democrats while only 21% are registered Republicans. Even before the opportunity for a minority to vote for a non-white candidate presented itself, they came out in huge numbers for the Democrats.</p>
<p>Generational demographics is another element that is contributing to the demise of the Republican Party. {snip} The decreasing Republican membership is reflecting the population trend that shows the numerical decline in the white birth rate. Since the GOP has been the traditional political-cultural home for white people, it follows that with fewer white people entering the human race, then there will be fewer white people in the Republican Party. With less new blood within the ranks, the GOP will contain an aging population, which will present additional image problems that will affect recruitment. {snip}</p>
<p>In attempting to woo voters who will never convert to the GOP, Republicans have alienated their traditional supporters, who now are refusing to back a party they rightly think has betrayed them. {snip}<br>

			<p>Once again, Buchanan hits the proverbial nail on the head:<br>
The only way the Republican Party can hope to recieve widespread &#8220;minority&#8221; support is if it becomes even more Leftist than the Democratic Party (which it looks like it&rsquo;s well on the way to doing). </p>
<p>The Republican Party has abandoned you, white America - will you in turn abandon it, or will you become 21st Century Jews desperately supporting the Nazi Party in the meager hope that they just <i>might</i> end your persecution if you click your heels and shout &#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221; enough?</p>

<p>Also because of welfare, Democrats will always outspend Republicans, no matter how big spending the Republicans get.  Therefore, they&rsquo;ll always get the minority vote because the Democrats can outpromise the Republicans.  This is why Obama got significantly more of the Hispanic vote than Kerry did four years ago, in spite of black-Hispanic feuds   &mdash;   Obama was just better at promising everyone everything.</p>

			<p>John Tait is 100% correct, as usual.  The only way that Republicans could possibly gain the support of minorities would be to become more liberal than Democrats.  Hence, the Republican Party would have to become ultra-Leftest Democrats.  </p>
<p>Also, as Tait points out, virtually all illegal immigrants and most legal immigrants into the USA will become Democrats.  Hence, by endorsing immigration, the Republican Party is signing its own death warrant.  </p>
<p>It may already be too late, but there still is a slight chance that the Republican Party can survive if it returned to its conservative values and pandered to European-Americans instead of to Minorities and recent immigrants.</p>

			<p>Who is so optimistic that he thinks the US will exist in its present form in 2042?</p>
<p>Or that Mexico will not have been taken over by the drug cartels, mandating a US takeover of Mexico with a complete revamping of government into a democracy, free of corruption?</p>
<p>I appreciate this man&rsquo;s warning, but the right should be trying to grow some cajones and tell it like it really is, instead of acting as if everything is going to carry on with business as usual.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look now, but the stock market is heading downward towards 5000, and there&rsquo;s a more than an even chance that Eastern Europe will collapse, causing a global meltdown all on its own.</p>
<p>Better worry about next year instead of decades down the road, eh?</p>

			<p>In the last election, I refused to vote for the lesser of two evils and resolved that I&rsquo;ll never vote for the lesser of two evils again.  Better to simply abstain when there is no choice. We need a strong, aggressive, intelligent and blunt-spoken party that isn&rsquo;t embarrassed to represent the interests of white Americans.  Clearly, the Republican Party has abandoned us in favor of their unrequited love of non-whites.  It&rsquo;s senseless for whites to hang on after the love has gone.   </p>

			<p>Well put. For every minority vote the GOP gets, they&rsquo;ll lose 5 white votes. And as for the diversity ploy of Steele and Jindal, that only make the betrayal of the base that much more obvious. I predict that this will be the impetus of the emergence of a viable third party in our lifetime. Unfortunately, as a college-educated, urban, heterosexual, young white male, I cannot see how my interests can be reconciled with that of the GOP. Funny, considering that I graduated from a college just a few blocks from William Buckley&rsquo;s home. Our demographic is now a people without a party.</p>

			<p>I did not vote for John McCain in the presidential election because I was so disgusted with his support for legalizing 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 illegal aliens, most of whom were Hispanic, and thus ensuring a despised and persecuted minority status for our people at an even faster pace.</p>
<p>John McCain&rsquo;s Hispandering was utterly worthless. Like Benjamin Franklin once said, &#8220;&hellip;will gain neither and lose both.&#8221; He was refering to government protection and civil liberties, but in the same sense John McCain gained neither the Hispanic or white vote, but instead lost both because Hispanics still voted Democratic and many whites, such as myself, felt betrayed and thus didn&rsquo;t vote for him.</p>
<p>If the GOP had the tiniest ounce of common sense, they would act to reverse the changing demographics which would put their party out of business for good. Working with the changing demographics has proven time and time again to not work, so why not try Plan B, which should have been the first plan of action: Reverse the immigration policies that will make Americans a minority, a despised minority, in our own country to ensure that power is retained.</p>

<p>Wham and Bam, you hit the nail right on the head there Mr. Tait!</p>
<p>The only hope the Republican Party has (or a very smart splinter group of that party, from its zombified parents&rsquo; &#8220;multicultural&#8221; ruins) is to openly advocate for white majority preservation. Moreover, be it from the party as a whole or a more dynamic &#8220;splinter group,&#8221; a return to an 85% to 90% white majority in the USA, should be unapologetically and aggressively<br>
demanded!</p>
<p>Any criticisms of this policy, be they by internal rainbow traitors or external Red enemies, should be openly denounced as advocating for the genocide of the white race in the USA and North America, respectively. </p>
<p>Or put another way; Bobby Jindal and Michael Steele are not my brothers when it comes to politics, or even my cousins.</p>
<p>Thus, why or how, would I ever see them as worthy of being the majority of my party, or worse my country?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>  If you check you will find that most of the Hispanics who voted<br>
Republican are or consider themselves to be white people.<br>
  Why should I vote for a Republican Party that says it does not represent white men and no longer wants to be a white party and elects a Black Chairman who pushes the race discrimination against whites usually called affirmative action and plans to recruit in Hip Hop and other anti-white subcultural groups and fields candidates like McCain (told the Republican base  to shut and about immigration)  and Lindsay Graham who said America is an idea and everyone should come&hellip;, at the expense of the whites who built America, of course.  McCain adopts foreign children when there are many children in the US that need homes.That is another piece of evidence that McCain and his wife do not care about American children who need homes. Look at a picture of  John McCain and Cindy with their adopted children and then tell me if this does not look like a preference for foreigners over Americans.<br>
   Chairman Steele thinks that hip hop fans will make good party members or he would not try to recruit them. Find the actual words to some hip hop music and then tell everyone what you think of Steel who wants to recruit this anti-white group. Read the words before you answer.<br>
  Why support this ?  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the dismal conclusion that too many members of the white race (maybe even a majority now) have nothing less than a <i>mania for extinction.</i>  &#8220;Competitive altruism,&#8221; and the social status among whites which attaches to being perceived as &#8220;not racist&#8221; and &#8220;celebrating diversity,&#8221; while descriptive in part of the motivation of white race liberals, doesn&rsquo;t begin to probe the dark heart (so to speak) of such white psychopathology.<p>I see articles like the above <b>all the time</b> here on Amren.  It&rsquo;s always some variation on a theme: either on a large scale, such as, the GOP must abandon its white voter base; Europe must import Third World colored immigrants; America must become majority non-white; or on a smaller scale, Reginald Denny hugs his vicious attackers at their public trial; the mothers of white girls, savagely attacked in Brooklyn without provocation by black females on MLK Day, publicize their &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; of their daughters&rsquo; feral assailants, etc.  <p>The theme is, &#8220;We white people want to be exterminated, we would rather not exist any more&hellip;&#8221;  If this isn&rsquo;t a mental illness, it sure looks like one, and it is being reinforced daily, relentlessly by our media, academic, political and even religious institutions.  How can white people, their race, their society, their culture, languages and civilization survive in the face of such officially sanctioned madness?</p></p></p>

			<p>Do you think any of the neo-con talk show hosts will ever touch this article with a ten foot pole? We Whites will soon disappear and never be mentioned again in this country. The Founders will magically all be blacks in the very near future. I can see the writing on the wall unless we stand up NOW! Michael Steel is a black first and always will be. Just like 99% of them are. </p>

Since the GOP has been the traditional political-cultural home for white people, it follows that with fewer white people entering the human race, then there will be fewer white people in the Republican Party.</i></p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be this way. As Ann Coulter pointed out, everything was poised for the Democrats to be the declining party. With their pro-abortion, feminist, anti-family agenda, it was their numbers that showed every sign of declining. Then came &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; and the enormous influx into the Democrat&rsquo;s voting bloc. </p>
<p>This ought to make the Republican base mad as hell, this conniving, manipulative meddling with the political structure and the population mix in this country, for the sheer purpose of political gain.</p>
<p><i>But as recent history has proved, Republican efforts to reach out to minorities have not only been fruitless, but have also irritated an already disappointed base.</i></p>
<p>If this is true, if the Republican base is so &#8220;irritated,&#8221; then  why isn&rsquo;t the base shaking the Republican leadership by the scruff of its neck and demanding fair representation and accountability? Or is the Republican base, contrary to what this article implies, just as deluded as the leadership? I suspect the latter. Otherwise, matters wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this bad in the first place.</p>

			<p>WHITE BREAD, THAT&rsquo;S YOU</p>
<p>Considering all the excitement about the verbal battles within the Conservative Movement, there has been an absence of reporting on Steele&rsquo;s willingness to use slurs to describe the diverse white Americans who support the Republican Party.  <br>
 <br>
Micheal S. Steele is willing to use unappetizing labels for Euro-Americans like &#8220;white bread,&#8221; a food-based slur made popular by the Dick Van Dyke TV show to show contempt toward European Americans, and to smother white American diversity and nationality under an unwanted label. <br>
 <br>
Michael S. Steele was reported on Politico on 12/9/08 as saying &ldquo;The Republican Party&rsquo;s strength comes in many forms and many hues. We have to understand now it&rsquo;s not all white bread.&rdquo; To have the insult of &#8220;white bread&#8221; used by a former Republican Lieutenant Governor of Maryland who is now the chairman of the National Republican Party tells us our status in that political party as loudly and clearly as anything can.<br>

			<p>according to Tait- &#8220;Steele won by 91-77. However, he won all 15 votes &mdash; one vote more than his margin of victory &mdash; from (majoriy non-white)U.S. territories. Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, The Virgin Islands, and The Northern Marianas. Why on earth are territories that are not alloted any electoral votes and thus have no say when it comes to who wins the presidency allowed to decide the head of the republican party?!! If this flaw were to be rectified by the party, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with phonies like Steele anymore. But I wouldn&rsquo;t bank on it happening. As for the demographic transformation underway since 1965, the chief achitect, Ted Kennedy was just knighted by the queen of England!Simply appaling.</p>

			<p>Embrace the change?  They created the change and are the ones pushing for the extinction of white white race!  The GOP hasn&rsquo;t been for white people since the last century.  Don&rsquo;t fool yourself, because no amount of voting is going to change anything.  Only turning inward will accomplish anything in the upcoming collapse.</p>

			<p>Screw the GOP. Anyone can see they have sold out first to the neo-cons, and secondly, to anything that keeps them in power, even if it means screwing whites. I no longer support them as a political party that represents my interests. I also, no longer listen to Rush Limbaugh. Why? Because he is an expert at talking around the major issues. I heard him the other day mention that we are going to experience disaster because of Obama and the Democrats expansion of the central government. What! Where has Limbaugh been the last eight years? Bush expanded the central governmetn by 3X. The GOP is dead, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Ann Coulter is also a cop out. She and Limbaugh, O&rsquo;Riley, Hannity,etc. should be supporting the formation of a third party. This is where they could actually do some good.</p>

			<p>As long as the Republicans plays &#8220;me too&#8221; with regards to the Welfare State for minorities, they will be between the proverbial &#8220;rock and a hard place.&#8221;  As previous posters have stated, minority voters (especially black and Hispanic) will vote for the Democrat Party simply because they offer more taxpayer-funded &#8220;goodies&#8221; than the GOP.</p>
<p>Stupid Party, indeed.</p>
<p>In addition, the Republicans threw away a golden opportunity from 2001-2007 when they had control of both Congress and the White House.  They could have controlled spending and bureaucracy.  They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Goldwater and Reagan, if still alive, wouldn&rsquo;t recognize today&rsquo;s GOP.  Why would they?  The GOP has turned downright socialist in the last eight years.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;The only way the Republican Party can hope to receive widespread &ldquo;minority&rdquo; support is if it becomes even more Leftist than the Democratic Party (which it looks like it&rsquo;s well on the way to doing). The Republican Party has abandoned you, white America - will you in turn abandon it, or will you become 21st Century Jews desperately supporting the Nazi Party in the meager hope that they just might end your persecution if you click your heels and shout &ldquo;Heil Hitler&rdquo; enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just wanted to see that in print again.</p>
<p>I wonder if the republican party or anyone will every really defends whites too, the way they all seem so eager to help any group that isn&rsquo;t white. Will it Ever happen? It might disillusion the nonwhites who have so much faith in business as usual and even in the republican party. Cant have that.</p>

     I could not agree more with you sentiments.  However, Teddy was not the architect of the 1965 Immigration Bill.  It was sponsored in the House by Emanuel Celler and in the Senate by Jacob Javits.  Javits persuaded Sen Philip Hart of Michigan to replace his name with that of Hart.  I doubt that Teddy was smart or sober enough to help craft that bill.  Publisher <br>
David Lawrence of USN&WR; magazine correctly predicted at the time that the passage of the bill would change the US to an entirely different country.</p>

<p>I appreciate your comments.  I think that white people are not consciously trying to commit suicide as a people.  But some of them are now waking up to the fact that it is happening, some of them have known for years.  And most are still brainwashed liberals.  When I see what is going on all around the world in Western countries, it is terrifying.  Muslims invading Europe and putting the native populations in virtual subjection.  Russia.  South Africa, Australia.  All under the thrall of liberal leftism.  Who is CONTROLLING this and COORDINATING it around the world?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s time to abandon the GOP<br>
It&rsquo;s time to reject the liberal paradigm of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and fake &#8220;harmony&#8221;.</p>
<p>When whites are outnumbered in America, their worst nightmares will come true, as happened in South Africa.</p>
<p>Why not be wise and recognize the realities of life:  That people naturally group themselves by race first and religion second.  </p>
<p>Politics in America WILL become race based.  In about 40 years parties will be based on skin color.  It is inevitable. Only white liberals, if they still exist, will continue the charade of &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221;  But America will look more and more like Africa every day, with law of the jungle as the rule of the day, and the strong survives.</p>
<p>Whites need to form a new fiscal and social conservative party based on our ancient Western culture and ways, and I would like to see it based on the so-called Judeo Christian foundation.</p>

			<p>Who cares about the GOP. Their finished, they had their time in the sun. Why dont we form a new party and support it. Clearly we are all sick of the monopolies that the DEMS and REPUBS have set in to play. We shouldnt be sitting behind our computers complain about them when we should form a new party or get behind another one. People here always complain about minorities seeing a problem and not doing anything about yet what are whites doing. Absolutely nothing and thats one of the main reasons why Obama won the election.</p>

Many people have been saying this all along, for years,  but now is the time more so than ever to get rid of them.  (Besides, many of those territories, eg.Puerto Rico, don&rsquo;t even want to be with us.  Our Big Business interests are determined to keep them  &#8220;in family&#8221;.  Let them go!)</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s much simpler than that.  It boils down to race, pure and simple.</p>
<p>I was very recently a seatmate, on a flight from South America, with a very well-educated gentleman   &mdash;  -   a PhD, a scholar, a fluent speaker of several languages, an employee of the UN and a large American foundation.  He is a Colombian (by family and birth) but  now a citizen and resident of the US,  and  apparently also of Switzerland. (He now lives in New York but spends a lot of time in Geneva.)</p>
<p>He is also tri-racial.   </p>
<p>When we got to the subject of Obama, he was rhapsodic.  He told me, frankly and straight out, that he identified with Obama because Obama was of mixed-race &hellip;. LIKE HIM.  He thought Obama presented a wonderful example to the world.  He expressed no interest in Obama&rsquo;s politics, nor his economic plan, nor ANYTHING else, other than his race (or his &#8220;races&#8221; in this case!)   I was amazed at his candor about this.   Even with this cosmopolitan, educated  person, it was all about race.</p>
<p>How much more so then, with the ordinary, uneducated Third Worlder  in the street!  They know nothing about politics or economics,  but  they all adore Obama simply because he <i>LOOKS LIKE THEM.</i></p>

			<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be this way. As Ann Coulter pointed out, everything was poised for the Democrats to be the declining party. With their pro-abortion, feminist, anti-family agenda, it was their numbers that showed every sign of declining. </p>
<p>Then came &ldquo;immigration reform&rdquo; and the enormous influx into the Democrat&rsquo;s voting bloc.  This ought to make the Republican base mad as hell, this conniving, manipulative meddling with the political structure and the population mix in this country, for the sheer purpose of political gain.<br>

This is amazingly similar to what has happened in Europe   &mdash;    in countries such as Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands   &mdash;    where the political parties have simply imported a NEW electorate to outnumber and replace the old one. Same strategy. Same results.</p>

I no longer support them as a political party that represents my interests. I also, no longer listen to Rush Limbaugh. Why? Because he is an expert at talking around the major issues.

<p>Wake up and smell the coffee Bobby.  These people are nothing more than mouthpieces for the neoconservatives.  Their only motivation is to do what they&rsquo;re told to get their paycheck every week.  Every one of them has cheerleaded the war on &#8220;terror&#8221; and co-opted it as a conservative issue to fool the bungling masses.  What&rsquo;s conservative about it?  It stands to reason that people who really believe in conservatism would live their lives in a similar way.  Hannity trashes Ron Paul at every opportunity.  Take the blinders off and look at what&rsquo;s right under your nose.  I know it&rsquo;s hard but when Republicans controlled everything our nation seemed to get even more liberal and it took three steps backwards.  It took a while to figure out it&rsquo;s because the politicians are only paying lip service to White voters and their concerns.  I&rsquo;ve had my awakening and there&rsquo;s no going back to the neoconservative camp.  </p>

Of course, Steele had no choice but to grovel and apologize later; but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the damage is done!</p>
<p>As for the Republican Party&hellip;  They just don&rsquo;t want to get it!  They continue to ignore the silent white majority while trying ever so hard to cater to the non-white minorities, and we all know that these non-whites will never ever vote Republican!  They will always go for the nanny party!  I guess the Republican Party would rather shrivel up and die then represent White American&hellip;  FOOLS!</p>

			<p>Goldwater and Reagan, if still alive, wouldn&rsquo;t recognize today&rsquo;s GOP. Why would they? The GOP has turned downright socialist in the last eight years. </p>
<p>Truely disgusted, I always LMAO when I read the stuff from Reagan worshippers. Who do you think did this to the country? Reagan had all the momentum on his side to stop immigration after Carter&rsquo;s stupid mariel boatlift. He could have used the bully pulpit and gotten all immigration stopped. However, Reagan wanted NOTHING to do with stopping immigration or keeping illegals out. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham/about_otis_graham.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham/about_otis_graham.html</a></p>
<p>Otis Graham has researched the whole mess when Reagan nixed any discussion of it in staff meetings. It was left to Congress to work on. Graham has written that besides the indifference, James Baker nixed the idea of a trigger on amnesty that would only have an amnesty once the border was secure.</p>
<p>The Republican party was too interested in what was good for Wall Street and corporate boardrooms. The meatpackers sent busses down to Mexico for illegals as strikebreakers.</p>
<p>https://www.citypaper.com/special/story.asp?id=6045</p>
<p>Do you think the unions didn&rsquo;t tell the administration this was going on? Peter Brimlow of VDARE was on staff and was told by other staffers that illegal immigration was good because it undermined unions.</p>
<p>Juan Mann at VDARE has chronicled how impossible it is to deport even criminals under the law Ronnie signed.</p>
<p>Just like the economy, an extremely stupid, lazy and worthless person in the White house cannot destroy America overnight, but allow that stupidity to go on for 30 years and you have both a demographic and economic nightmare.</p>

			<p>Agree with Jonathan 3/5.  The MSM controlled DNC has successfully overcome a once white founded nation.  It has done so by passing laws making whites subordinate to other races. It also included other things like sex and religion to divide US into parts for destruction.  The success of such laws are evident.  Adding insult to injury, DNC has successfully funded the chosen (payback voters) groups with every kind of taxpayer entitlement to overcome US heritage.  Most groups representing the MSM controlled DNC depend upon US entitlements.  If available it may reveal the GOP pays taxes to support mostly DNC party voters.  Especially the newest usurpers of our land/money/culture/language - illegal immigrants.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve proposed many times a viable broadly-based third party as the only solution to the duopoly headlock we find ourselves in. How about a Productive Party? No more than minimal welfare for the &#8220;traditionally&#8221; unemployed with a promise of a competitive economy based on full employment for the willing. Forget race and ethnicity for the time being; it is too divisive and leaves out many who would rally to a cause that is forward-looking and realistic. Race and ethnicity, anyway, maybe don&rsquo;t really belong in a political party except insofar as that party would pledge to honor the the right to associate privately with whom one wishes, with no obnoxious commentary ( a la Holder ) on the subject.<br>
It seems to me the Republican Party is carrying a heavy historical load based on its enmeshment with Lincoln and the causes of his era; similarly the Democrats are burdened with FDR. Away with them both, I say.  The weight of the ideological carapace they both carry around renders debate about what really matters today clumsy and confused. Our country faces such a profound jeopardy from foreign financial control that the secessionistic impulse is sure to grow.<br>
It is not that I am not ethno-centric; like most people I prefer my own. It just seems that the best way to preserve one&rsquo;s ethnic community is by ensuring the negative freedom of being left alone by the social engineers. There will always be those who, possibly for genetic reasons, are extremely endogamous and search out partners of other races. The huge mistake of politicizing this impulse, which is what Obama has done, leaves that whole movement open to a simple economic end-around. </p>
