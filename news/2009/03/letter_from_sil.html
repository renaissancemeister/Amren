<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote><i>There has been much discussion about the advisability of letting in more foreign engineers to work in American high-tech companies. Here is a report from an American engineer who wishes to remain anonymous.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>The well-publicized downturn in the semiconductor industry finally took its toll on my company and I was laid off on July 1st. Since then I have been looking for work. Yesterday&rsquo;s interview for an engineering position at a Milpitis chip company had quite an effect on me. <em>All</em> the engineers there are foreigners from East Asia. I believe the interview was an exercise in futility, an act of going through the motions.</p>
<p>One of the interviewers asked me how I would feel about being culturally isolated at the company: &#8220;Many of us speak Chinese to each other. We&rsquo;re all from the Orient.&#8221; I said something PC. The three Chinese interviewers were nice and intelligent people, but very foreign, and the interviews were uncomfortable and awkward. We neither connected well nor had much in common. I answered their technical questions well, but the problem is culture and nationality, not engineering. I think the interview was just for the purpose of using me as proof that they &#8220;searched&#8221; for an American whereas what they really want is to hire a Chinese H-1B worker. [H-1B visas are granted to workers with special skills that presumably cannot be found in the American workforce.]</p>
<p>A recent interview with a Sunnyvale chip company was similar: The company is all foreign-born Asians. I had a thorough tour of the company, so I know. One of the interviewers was almost incomprehensible with his thick accent and poor English. I was thinking, &#8220;Why do I have to put up with this in my own country? Why is <em>he</em> the one with the power over <em>me</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a similar experience at a Fremont chip company, where three of the four interviewers were Indian. The one white asked me how I would feel working in an all-Asian environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a state of shock. It really hit me after the Milpitis interview. I drove home in a trance, my mouth dry and open. The radio was on, but I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. After I pulled into my driveway, I didn&rsquo;t get out of the car for five minutes. I just sat there, stunned.</p>
<p>Reality has set in: I will have to leave California. The situation here is beyond what I can tolerate. I cannot work in an all-foreign environment, where I have nothing in common with anyone, where every communication with co-workers is strained and difficult. I&rsquo;m not just a worker, I&rsquo;m a human being. As soon as I walked in the door, I got on the phone to a high-tech recruiter. I told her, &#8220;Help me to get out of this place as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad, because I love California. While growing up in the Midwest and attending college in another part of the country, I dreamed of coming here. Now I realize it&rsquo;s not part of the United States anymore, and I&rsquo;m being pushed out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just one person in the large stream of American engineers who have left or are planning to leave. A co-worker at my last company is transferring to the company branch in Austin, Texas. His sole reason, which he made clear to everyone in our department, was to work in an environment &#8220;that doesn&rsquo;t have so many immigrants.&#8221; He&rsquo;ll be a loss to the Silicon Valley office because of his excellent technical abilities.</p>
<p>He told me privately how his patience was wearing thin trying to deal with Asian engineers at the chip companies he served. The attitudes of some of them (mainly Chinese) really got on his nerves. Apparently, they&rsquo;re often pushy and rude, and treat Americans like foreigners in our own country.</p>
<p>During its first 25 years, nearly all of the Silicon Valley engineers were native-born. Americans invented Silicon Valley. We invented and developed all the technology we use in our daily lives. The valley and companies like Intel, Motorola, IBM, etc. would not exist if it weren&rsquo;t for us. Jobs in those companies should be for us. But because of industry demands for cheap labor, and a corrupt national government, there has been a revolution: Since the mid-1980s, the valley has been transformed from a cohesive, productive, American place to work, into a nightmarish scene of foreign takeovers. These foreigners are <em>not</em> better engineers than we are. We just have suicidal immigration laws.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is beyond hope. Every company is inundated with foreigners. If 75 percent of the engineers around here aren&rsquo;t foreign, then I don&rsquo;t have blond hair and blue eyes. If the number of H-1B numbers does rise to 115,000 a year, as many company owners want it to, that would be the final nail in the coffin for Americans living here.</p>
<p>I recently gave up the idea I had for a &#8220;Euro-American&#8221; or &#8220;American Citizens&rsquo; High-Tech Employment Group.&#8221; It&rsquo;s too late for that. Foreign Asians are now the gatekeepers of the Valley; they&rsquo;re the ones who call the shots on who gets hired or fired. And they hire their own people  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s why companies are all-Asian. There would have to be a large number of Americans in high-tech positions for a Euro-American group to have any effect. That situation no longer exists.</p>
<p>Imagine an army in full retreat, fleeing from a massive attack from the enemy. One of the retreating soldiers steps out and throws a little rock at the attackers, who respond with mortar shells and artillery. That little rock represents the potential effectiveness of a pro-American hiring group. It would amount to nothing, because the number of American engineers here is shrinking to nothing. And Americans in other states know of the catastrophe that has struck the area, and don&rsquo;t want to be part of it.<br>

<p><br>
I have noticed that since the election of the new president, the growth of the nastiness and arrogance of brown and yellow immigrants, whether they be dishwashers, waiters, restaurant managers or Doctors/engineers no matter how polite and pleasant the White person is.</p>
<p>Perhaps the writer should file a racial discrimination suit-now its our turn!</p>

<p>So they have something in common with &#8216;white&rsquo; employers too? besides a continuously drummed in disregard for white folks.</p>

			<p>Having studied at MIT a while back, I can point out a few common flaws in white Americans&rsquo; approaches to engineering study that might lie behind the Asians&rsquo; disdain for American tech people.  </p>
<p>One sees Americans, but not Asians, motivated by the &#8220;Big Tough Engineer&#8221; image, the traditional image of a heroic builder of dams, the mover of large heavy masses of material to make something of value to civilization by means of applying Reason and well-memorized Laws of Engineering.  Most of the whites I know with this mentality were trained in it by their Big Tough Engineer fathers.  Problem is, times have changed, and most engineering not only deals with the small (and very very small, cf. high-speed chip design), but with the highly subtle and highly abstract.  MIT students who come in with the Big Tough mindset  &mdash;  even if among the few majoring in Civ.Eng.  &mdash;  have to change mindsets very quickly.  Not all can; some muddle through the abstractions (with lots of help from course TAs and fratmates) and hope to somehow regain Bigness and Toughness when out on the job.  </p>
<p>Asians seem to be comfortable with subtlety and abstraction from day one.  They value mental endurance, which is a different kind of toughness than Big Tough Dam-Builder&rsquo;s.  They are more meditative and inwardly focused  &mdash;  important for the deeper kinds of math, as more and more &#8220;pure math&#8221; turns out to be actually useful in engineering  &mdash;  as opposed to Dam-Builder&rsquo;s divorced-from-self focus on &#8220;things&#8221; in external physical reality. </p>
<p>Asians seem to know that Dam-Builder is going to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; and fall flat on his face upon reaching a certain level of abstraction.  Even if Dam-Builder has enough abstraction skill for the job he&rsquo;s doing, he&rsquo;ll be viewed with suspicion as someone who&rsquo;s incurably limited.  Moreover, his concrete-bound approach lacks beauty.  Asians appreciate beauty. </p>
<p>Part of this may be that Asian males (yes I have seen white American females with Big Tough syndrome, but it does seem mainly a male issue) are brought up with more exposure to abstract principles with beauty in them, and aren&rsquo;t told that beauty (at any level) is sissy.  The MIT Asians seem to be more likely than the MIT white males to grow up playing piano or violin rather than football.  </p>
<p>Another issue is attitude toward homework and preparatory work.  I won&rsquo;t go into the well-known Confucian-vs.-not issues here, but will mention that when I was at MIT (early &#8216;80&rsquo;s), the white males either worked totally alone (they usually did well on the work, but weren&rsquo;t as prepared for team work this way), or had the most immensely bad homework habits.  They would get together with floormates at 10PM the night before the problem set was due, and each floormate would try to figure out &#8220;something&#8221; about some part of some problem.  They would patch together enough &#8220;somethings&#8221; to get partial credit for as many problems as possible.  There was no concern for actually understanding the problems, or the principles actually involved, and solving them honestly and for real.  </p>
<p>If I ever mentioned anything about real principles involved in any homework-type problem, or that it applied for real to anything beyond the course, I would be ridiculed as &#8220;nerd&#8221;, or told I was trying to see too much in the material (like, why waste brain cycles on such things).  This was from non-Asian guys.  I could not imagine any of the Asians responding that way.</p>

			<p>I too have fled California, my home state.  California was paradise when I grew up and went to college in the early 1970&rsquo;s.  Today is it a frothing, angry, polluted, over-crowded, pit of squabbling ethnic groups, crime, traffic, smog and stress.  The USA has handed over the most desirable piece of real estate on the planet to foreigners who neither like us or our culture &amp; customs.  I&rsquo;m sick about it.</p>

<p>What a gut wrenching article!</p>
<p>I have read it before in the past, but it still leaves me with a nagging sense of frustration and anger to this day; much like a phantom limb, after an amputation, it still itches and twitches.</p>
<p>I might call that phantom limb California, but this madness is not just happening in that state. I have a cousin who worked for about a year in one of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; auto companies in Detroit, as an engineer; how he found employment in that industry and his field was simple, both his parents were employed in the company and pulled a few strings. </p>
<p>He soon found out that this minor blessing for a fresh graduate, was also a larger curse. Except for a few supervisors and other young white engineers like himself, he was drowning in a sea of alien H-1B invaders, mostly Indians. Worse still, was how he and his fellow whites were treated as &#8220;outsiders&#8221; not just by the invaders, but also by the corporate power structure as well at this company.</p>
<p>The happy note to all of this is that he eventually: left the place, obtained his PhD, and started his own small consulting/R and D firm. </p>
<p>The horrid note to all of this is that is where the phantom limb begins, the realization that we are best on our own, when it comes to dealing with the multicultural power structure in this country. These treasonous corporations, who want our tax money to &#8220;bail&#8221; them out, now that they have all but destroyed everything they command, in the name of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s funny because the people today who are building giant infrastructure projects today, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" rel="nofollow">really big dams</a>, are the Chinese.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been decades since I was in engineering school but either the quality of the white students has been degraded or you&rsquo;re exaggerating (I don&rsquo;t know which).  The students I knew (and back then they were overwhelmingly white) had an appreciation for math and abstraction.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the former case is true because we now live in a culture that discourages serious intellectual work (as opposed to the pseudo-intellectual work of the various university &#8220;studies&#8221; programs).  Certainly any kid who is subjected to a contemporary American public school is seriously handicapped from the start, no matter what his race is.</p>

			<p>Recently, while drinking coffee in a international coffee chain,<br>
the barista, a tatooed asian man was cleaning up near where I was<br>
sitting.  Suddenly, he said something as if he was fussing at me<br>
and walked away quickly.  I was surprised at this outburst as I<br>
was minding my own business. </p>

Absolutely!  I can identify with this view and can sympathize with it. It reveals a serious flaw in our (recent) culture and especially in our education. For the past half-centure, we have concentrated on the technical, while our culture has degenerated downwards towards the primitive.  They doubtlessly see Americans as barbarians.  And, frankly, many Americans are!</p>

<p>I met an Engineer who was unemployed for around a year. Couldn&rsquo;t even get an interview, he said. The very week the H-1B visa quota had filled up/maxed out for the year, he got a call to come in for an interview. I can sympathize with what you are saying. When you mention your friend got his job through connections, however, I have to wonder if the company bosses are actually right. The business of America is business. When you get down to it, American business leaders are ruthless. I mean that only in a complimentary way. With their hands tied having to Look like nice guys all the time (and of course no one ever thinks they are still), I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this is a case of simply using other means to get the job done. Now, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on here, I&rsquo;m just saying, but it looks like once again at fault here is liberalism running amok. Of course the answer will be to further constrain the white man, and to treat everything but the disease itself.  <br>

			<p>We white Americans have gone from the wilderness to the moon in 200 years with very little if any help from non whites. Asians are good once the spark of white brilliance sets them on the path to discovery.They do not,on average, grasp the big picture. That is why you will see them form massive committees to try and solve complex problems.The main reason they are here is they work cheap and the elites that occupy the American government, at its highest level, embrace the genocide of whites. Genocide is defined by the United Nations as &#8221; The replacement of one genome type with another.&#8221; Whites are slowly but surely being ethnicaly cleansed from California,the land their for-fathers created and built.</p>

			<p>Tell all the white Californians to stay exactly where they are. They are not welcome outside of California. Your methods and values did not work to save California and you will not help save anywhere else either. You are defeated and we do not want you here. Stay where you are or leave the country entirely. </p>
<p>There is plenty of work abroad but do not come to Austin, Texas. We already have plenty Californians already. The first they they want is to make Texas &#8220;just like California&#8221;. We don&rsquo;t want to end up like California and we definitely do not need to follow your failed examples.</p>
<p>I am sorry to have to speak plainly but the truth is&hellip;.either you need to stay in California or leave the USA altogether.<br>
We already have plenty retreating California refugees and we do not need any more of them.</p>

			<p>Asian Americans have always been thought of and depicted as &#8220;perpetual foreigners&#8221;, completely separate from mainstream America. They are labeled with ridiculous stereotypes. Affirmative Action works against them. Their political influence is limited. And yet they persevere&hellip; If you think being in the majority culture is tough, can you even begin to imagine what they go through?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how good you have it. Which of you would like to trade places with Asian America?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re White, disenfranchised, and frequenting this site then here&rsquo;s news. Your problem doesn&rsquo;t lie with Asians, it&rsquo;s just you.  </p>

			<p>Convair, the reason is race. </p>
<p>You are chasing a canard when you look to  the supposed shortcomings of some American students for an explanation of the total shut-out of our own in an industry created in White America, by White Americans.  In our generation, no less.  </p>
<p>I have worked for years in Asian countries as a teacher of the English language, and even in that industry there are jobs reserved for the locals, even if they are extremely incompetent.  </p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t count the number of times I have had basic level students in adult classes who were embarrassed to admit their occupation, because they were already employed as English teachers.  They have the jobs with benefits &amp; security that no foreigner will be considered for.  </p>
<p>The huge and obvious difference in ability is irrelevant: they prefer their own. </p>
<p>This is perfectly natural, and I accept that as one of the inherent burdens of being a traveler.  However, that the very same conditions should prevail in America, in favor of the Chinese (or anybody else), makes me sick with rage and grief. </p>
<p>It is an outrage!  The only problem with Americans (I refer here to the white ones, the ones who created not only Silicon Valley, but the entire nation), is our unwillingness to protect our own kind.  </p>
<p>The Chinese, indeed all races save the White Race, are not so self-destructive.  They follow the natural imperative to protect the interests of their own kind, and to expand their numbers, territory and influence.  </p>
<p>If the White Race does not snap out of its malaise right now, and begin to defend itself against the rapidly swelling hostile alien hordes the world over instead of subsidizing them while castrating &amp; strangling itself at the same time, we may well see our grandchildren suffer the fate of being the last of their kind, as we go extinct. </p>
<p>Instead of looking to the future with the stars in their eyes, we will see them looking back at us in forlorn despair, their tears condemning us with the question: &#8220;Why? Why did you abandon your children to this fate?&#8221;  </p>
<p>As for me, I will be happy to die before then; whether in the battle that turns the tide or in an already doomed attempt.  If you see that day of ultimate despair, it will be because you refused to see that the reason is race. </p>

			<p>I grew up in California but chose to leave/flee with wife and 3 children in 1980. Since this time the flagrant policies of government and business have caused the state further harm through uncontrolled immigration having turned the once great state of California into a third world barrio/Chinatown. Millions of white Americans have fled in horror at the development taking place in California and cannot believe that the policy that has made a few wealthy yet has made refugees of countless former Californians can really have taken place at all. Now this invasion by immigration is spreading to all 50 states with no end in sight. God help us if this insanity, stoked by pure greed, is allowed to continue.<br>

			<p>The post by convairXF92 was the biggest bunch of baloney I&rsquo;ve read here in quite some time. Having attended a HS in Los Angeles that was almost 50% Asian and then attended UCLA, chock full of Asians, I can tell you the post was nothing more than a) a hopelessly roundabout attempt to insult whites, and b) the usual fawning over a group of non-whites we see from the hopelessly brainwashed. As far as the Asian appreciation for math, science, abstraction, almost every white (who isn&rsquo;t self-deceptive) who has had to work and deal with these people can tell you that their capabilities in handling abstraction drop off considerably when you are &#8220;off book&#8221; or you are dealing with a problem that requires out of the box or divergent thinking. It is in the latter area where they seem to have the most difficulty in comparison with whites. Hence the high levels of patent infringement and theft we see from these people. Please spare us the made up stories of Asians and their fascination with nuance. It isn&rsquo;t true and in fact it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;there&#8221;. They have their talents, we have ours. They test poorly in problem recognition, something that is apparently verboten to mention in today&rsquo;s PC world. </p>
<p>The US needs a change in policy, in fact, a change in government to correct things. Otherwise, you will see various fields dominated by Asians who will work hard while making very slow advancements. The creative spark isn&rsquo;t there. Just look at some of the silly things done in Japanese schools in the attempt to enhance creativity. Creativity is innate. Which is why you can be sure these people are looking into harvesting Caucasian DNA to find out just where and how they can &#8220;add&#8221; it to their own make-up. </p>

<p>The irony of The Valley now being almost all non-white in terms of employees is that the Valley became the Valley when one of the main participants in the project to built the transistor settled in the Valley and used his knowledge and some money to start a company that&rsquo;s now known as Intel.  On the team to build the transistor was William Shockley, who post-transistor would go into the science of racial differences.</p>

<p>I sympathize with you completely.  As a Southerner I got really ticked off after Va, NC, and Fla went blue this past election.  Do white people who live in blue states up North and out West have some disease or something that causes them to be out of touch with reality?  They ruin their own states and in response migrate to our states, pushing their same failed &#8220;diversity&#8221; breeding policies on the rest of us.  No Thank you! Stay in your own states and fix your own problems.</p>

			<p>Let me add my two cents to this fascinating discussion&hellip;&hellip;.first both the asians and whites want to achieve a better life for themselves and their children and both races have a lot of delayed gratification skills which is the key trait to advancing in society (yes I know there are some dysfuntional exceptions but as a general rule this notion applies).  As evidenced in the aerospace world which I have been a part of for three decades I have noticed that in general that the whites see the big picture better, are better leaders and organizers and have better written skills.  They also take more and bigger risks and are not so much afraid of failure.  They seem less afraid of failure than the Asians because they seem to know that you can learn a heck of a lot from failure and in the long run you will come out ahead if you stick you neck out once in a while.  These are some of their advantages.</p>
<p><br>
The Asians at least the Koreans whom I worked with on many problem solving issues crave consensus.  They want everyone to buy in to a solution before going forward.  While they outwork the Anglos they are terribly afraid of failure and losing face.<br>
The Anglos seem to able to work with more risk and confidence in themselves. We also seem more inventive with creative solutions and we see problems as opportunities.  Also the Anglos have a better sense of humor.  We joke around more and this is I am convinced helps us find solutions to difficult problems because we can back off and catch our breath and look at things from a different angle and lo and behold here&rsquo;s something we haven&rsquo;t look at before&hellip;&hellip;let&rsquo;s try this to see if it works.</p>
<p>Remember who broke the sound barrier ? Who built the first airplane ?  Who sent 12 men to the moon and back ?  Who landed Spirit and Opportunity on Mars several years ago and these probes are still working ?</p>
<p>I will grant that the Asians do work and study harder than the americans and probably they do have a few IQ points more than us but as far as creativity, risk taking and confidence in ourselves we have the advantage. America&rsquo;s best days are still ahead of us.</p>

			<p>I fled in 1979 but had been born and raised there and saddened to see to degenerate so. Long before the hoards invaded, it was paradise on earth. In the Santa Clara Valley (now the infamous  Silicon Valley), strawberry fields and apricot and plum orchards were the order of the day. Whites were the huge majority race and life was fine. Visited to see a dying relative in 2001 and couldn&rsquo;t believe the changes. Asians everywhere living in McMansions instead of the modest homes that used to occupy the neighborhood, intense traffic of expensive cars. I wouldn&rsquo;t live there if paid to, eyt the relatives who stayed  don&rsquo;t see it much, they are cooked frogs&hellip; </p>

<p>You may be right in this, the Calif. refugees haven&rsquo;t done a whole lot of good for Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, S.C. or N.C. It seems they brought all the southern invaders with them with a tracking device each refugee must be wearing.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d have to agree with whoever said that the problem isn&rsquo;t so much that Asians are better at abstract thinking, but rather that our public schools have done a huge disservice to white students (and all students, for that matter).</p>
<p>I work in aerospace, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that the older whites are perfectly comfortable with subtlety and abstraction. It&rsquo;s the younger workers, both whites and Asians who grew up here, who have more difficulty grasping abstraction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve put put ourselves in a self-destructive cycle. The same dumb kids we&rsquo;ve brought up are now entering the ranks of educators. The irony is that to restore our former might, we might have to staff our schools with foreigners on H1-B visas.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing   &mdash;   we should not mind small numbers of highly skilled, well educated foreigners coming here. Fear not those who come to seek opportunity, but fear the great unwashed from the south of the border who come to seek handouts.</p>

			<p>I have to agree with the posting by &#8216;georgia son of the confederacy&rsquo;.  I&rsquo;ve been shocked since I read the original article and then angry since I read the posting by convairXF92.  I think he proves that diversity is a bad idea, that rather than being a strength, it is the country&rsquo;s prevailing weakness.  Asians come to the United States, attend our world class universities, work in American companies where they are welcomed in the environment of rich diversity, they use American technology, they fly aboard American space shuttles and American space stations, they develope software at American firms using American operating systems with computers that use microprocessors invented in America, etc., etc., etc.  And when given the oportunity, they exlude white Americans as explained in the original article.  American students at MIT play football and baseball.  These are American past times.  Part of our culture.  Asians want to play musical instruments such as violins, harps, and flutes.  Mr. convairXF92&rsquo;s attitude is one of disdain when he describes these cultural differences.  He would advocate denial of employment to these Americans.  He doesn&rsquo;t like them.  He doesn&rsquo;t like this &#8216;big engineer&rsquo; attitude.  I sometimes wonder if enormous, atomic aircraft carriers would ever have been built without this sort of American bravado, arrogance, or whatever you want to label it as.  Mr. convairXF92 does not appreciate the benefits of Americans and Asians working together to form a stronger paradigm.  His attitude is in stark contrast to Mr. &#8216;georgia soc&rsquo; who shows admiration for the strengths that Asians bring to bear alongside of Americans.  Mr. convairXF92 is clearly no fan of diversity.  This is ironic in light of the fact that America&rsquo;s adherence to the benefits of diversity is the only reason for his being here at all.  Maybe in the absence of Americas diversity policy he might today be a peasant farmer in rural china where he might even be spreading human feces upon the fields with his hands.</p>
<p>As I stated a moment ago, &#8216;georgia soc&rsquo; shows admiration for asians even to the point of conceding that they may posess slightly higher IQs than whites.  I&rsquo;ve always been a great admirer of the Japanese (not their unfair trade policies of mind you).  I wish people in the U.S. could look on this country (Japan) and others and try to find what they have that could make us better.  Despite my Admiration for Japanese society I still realize that had it not been for the United States following WWII, they might today be another third world country like china.  I think we could say the same thing about Korea.</p>
<p>So I would say to Mr. convairXF92, maybe you should move to China where more people play the violin and appreciate subtleties and there will be less diversity to trouble you.  You could work in their space program.  As you know they are busy harvesting 1960&rsquo;s American space technology.  Harvesting existing American technology is something the many Asians excel at.  I think your superior ability to appreciate pure math may help them to reach the moon by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an admirer of Asian intelligence, but I wonder when this edge begins to wear off.  Second generation, third generation?  I see many Asians at starbucks reading commic books with their tatoos and nose rings.  Many young Asian females are there with their African American boyfriends.  Also, when I was in graduate school working on my Masters in Computer Science we had three Asians (their families were orignally from China, but they spoke fluent English).  My first thought when I saw them was, &#8220;Oh no! Chinese students!  They&rsquo;re going to kick my but&#8221;.  Guess what, my fear was short lived.  These asians were dummies! The smart American white kid smoked them!  Just realize, not all Asians are brilliant.</p>

			<p>West Coast Techie: I agree. I changed careers and went to engineering school in the 90s. I don&rsquo;t buy into the &#8220;tough&#8221; engineer idea. It is anecdotal,of course, and my experience was different. Of course large numbers of Asians have been brought into our schools, and I suspect we see the cream of the crop. I have also heard of the analytical skills of the Asians, something I usually associate with R&D; and analyst positions. Most of my fellow engineers simply like the work of problem solving. I do sometimes fear that young whites are being steered away from engineering, but with the H1-b trick and our forfeiture of manufacturing, what&rsquo;s one to do?</p>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t white Californians or any other average white who is brining the invaders into the US. CA was the testing ground for the experiment, and now it&rsquo;s rampant around the US. I have to laugh when I see and hear whites in Indiana, Illinois, Colorado and everywhere else blame the fleeing whites for the invasion. It&rsquo;s the US government, the people who actually control the government, hauling in the invaders of all stripes from the third world. Wake up and realize whites are going to have to become a cohesive, racially aware group to end this. </p>

I think that the &#8220;white&#8221; states were designated &#8220;red&#8221; as an inside joke by the people who really run things because they are in fact &#8220;reds&#8221;.

			<p>I work as a software engineer on Wall Street and my manager is Asian, from China.  He can barely speak English, and everyone I work with, including senior people on the business side, think he is a joke.  He is rude, always cuts people off on the phone, and is very hostile, and will never give recognition to anyone.  He also over delegates, and is VERY hands off.  Yet he is still around, even after many layoffs, because his boss is another unintelligent Asian, from the Phillipines to be exact.  They look after each other like the article states.  She is an affirmative action case - an asian with a Spanish last name.  Many from the Phillipines come here and pretend to be of Spanish descent and get affirmative action.  She also makes over 200k a year, and gave her fellow asian a nice bonus this year while nobody else got a penny.   And I am tired of everyone acting like every Asian is some kind of math genuis.  There are bound to be a few smart ones amongst the few billion of them.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the WHITE people who run our government are not strong people.  They are weak, and greedy.  And most white people are led to believe they are weak by our government.  That is why most idolize sports figures.  They are looking for a physically strong role model.  The white people who run our government have sold our all us other white people so that they can create a welfare state.  The first step towards the People&rsquo;s Republic of North America.</p>

If the ex-Californians start spouting diversity noise, put them in their place, but, from what I see on this site, Californians are the most persuasive witnesses of the damage caused by immigration.  They ought be welcomed by any racially conscious White.</p>

<p>But those &#8220;subtle&#8221; Asians play <i>European</i> music on those violins and pianos, don&rsquo;t they?  Most won&rsquo;t bother spending their time on ethnic Asian instruments or compositions, instead focusing on mastering Western music.  That&rsquo;s a good symbol for the flaw in your logic: Asians excel at copying and even <i>marginally</i> improving white inventions, but almost every modern technology was invented by whites.  Asians could only create 1st world societies by copying us.  </p>

			<p>The bottom line is that white people need to learn to get a backbone and to have more pride in their race.  I can tell you why so many whites are brainwashed into thinking Asians are some master race (Asians including Indians). I think part of it has to do with the following&hellip;..</p>
<p>I just watched a documentary on India&rsquo;s history. I am interested in other cultures and I thought it would be interesting just for the sake of it. I like traveling. Sadly it was narrated by a self-hating dorky British man who stopped at nothing to try to prove how India has always been a superior civilization to anything the West has produced.</p>
<p>He started from India&rsquo;s earliest beginnings and then went all the way up to the present. Throughout the whole thing he had nothing but positive things to say about India and even it&rsquo;s foreign invaders. Then he gets to the British Colonial period and things change. </p>
<p>During the whole chapter of the documentary on British Colonization he spent the entire time talking about how brutal the British were. He could have spent that time instead talking about the many ways the British modernized India. No of course not. He leaves us to assume that India modernized on its own. </p>
<p>If an alien from Outer Space who knew nothing about Indian history watched this documentary, he would walk away thinking that the British did nothing but run through the country and shoot people just because they could. So we are left to assume that the British brought nothing of value to India, unlike India&rsquo;s previous invaders.</p>
<p>I am quite disgusted right now. I just got done watching a white man run through India bashing his own people as he is chatting with the natives of the country, laughing up a storm with them over it, while saying nothing negative whatsoever about India. I was just waiting for an Indian to push this British sheep of a man over to the ground for no reason at all. In retaliation he would just giggle and then give the Indian permission to step on him as well.</p>
<p>Sadly this represents what too many members of our race have become. I am sick of this. We can&rsquo;t go on like this. </p>

			<p>How about, &#8220;no taxation without PROPORTIONAL representation&#8221;?</p>
<p>Consider this theory about California&rsquo;s demise:</p>
<p>1. Productive people flee to California from New England to escape punitive taxes in the 1970&rsquo;s.<br>
2. Their success (Silicon Valley) attracts hordes of losers who get onto the ballots.<br>
3. Losers vote representatives such as Nancy Pelosi etc. who promise to steal from the rich and give it to them.<br>
4. Over time California becomes a basket case.<br>
5. Productives flee to Texas.<br>
6. Repeat 1-4.</p>
<p>The only way to put an end to this vicious cycle is &#8220;Representation proportional to Taxation&#8221;.</p>

As someone who likes Hot Rod cars, I found the same issue with my Asian friends explaining the 1970 Hemi Challenger vs Asian pile. The Hemi is as subtle as a Earthquake, but my Asian friends wanted to know why the interior of the manifold was not ceramic coated, or why the engine wasn&rsquo;t all Aluminum. The prevaling attitude is that, sure it made 500 stock, but think how much more it would have made if the engine builders had only thought it through!</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to speak plainly but the truth is&hellip;.either you need to stay in California or leave the USA altogether.<br>
We already have plenty retreating California refugees and we do not need any more of them. Memphomaniac&#8221;</p></blockquote><br>
Memphomaniac, you speak of a misconception common among our kinsmen, which is that we Californian White folks are especially blameworthy for the racial maelstrom engulfing our State. And, with that premise, you go on to conclude, quite logically, that bad Californians should be kept out of your State, lest we bring the bad Californian virus with us.
<p>Well, the premise here needs tuning. The open borders catastrophe was helped along by practically 100% of 435 Congressmen and 100 Senators, only 12% of whom are Californians. California alone never set our suicidal border policy and never was allowed to have any hand in border enforcement. This catastrophe was inflicted by the concerted efforts of bought and disloyal carpetbaggers and scalawags from 50 States and the District of Criminals. </p>
<p>Another premise that needs tuning is the reason that the non-White invaders picked California in the first place to launch their invasion. Why have so many Mexicans, Chinese, and Indians, etc. come here first instead of wherever you are? Because, being free to go anywhere their little hearts want to go inside a unitary United States, they say to themselves: hey, this California place is great&hellip;I want this&hellip;let&rsquo;s steal this White man&rsquo;s heaven. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the one we want first! The greatest natural harbors on Earth, the greatest agricultural valleys on Earth, the best climate on Earth, the richest State on Earth, the greatest university system ever built, forests, mountains, rivers, water, ocean, beaches, minerals, crops, power, fun, money, naively nice White sucker guys, naively nice pretty White women&hellip;that&rsquo;s where I want to park my Mexican, Chinese, or Indian derriere. We&rsquo;ll get to all the other States in due course, the invaders say to themselves.</p>
<p> And&hellip;as you know there in Austin (or most anywhere else in the USA)&hellip;due course is already upon you.</p>
<p>So, this mistaken diagnosis of sole cause to a peculiarly Californian disease leads you to prescription of a cure that won&rsquo;t work. Quarantining Californians out of your State won&rsquo;t even help. Consider, please, that Californians, who have watched the most beautiful State on Earth go from over 91% White as teenagers to under 48% White as just-getting-old baby boomers may be of special value to our people.  Californians may be more likely to carry strong antibodies against the racial suicide pathogen than some of their kinsmen who have been blessed by living farther behind the front lines. Seasoned California veterans, both the majority who stood their ground in California and those who retreated to fight on different ground, are bound to be a critical part of our whole people&rsquo;s development of the racial immune system required if we are to live. To live as what we really are, and what only we can be, one genetic family. We Californians didn&rsquo;t choose to be on the front line of this invasion. We didn&rsquo;t particularly enable it any more than the rest of our folk. We started out with the same universally TV-brainwashed minds that we&rsquo;ve all had to deprogram. But now, painfully living the actual process of being shoved out of our own childhood neighborhoods, and being robbed of the world we assumed was ours into eternity, we&rsquo;ve been made more likely to be valuable battlers alongside you, and less likely to be dangerous zombies to be driven off with burning torches. </p>
<p>P.S. As an important aside in the whole California question, please keep in mind that there are still about 17 million White folks in what remains by far the most White-populous State in America. And consider that many millions of us that are still here do intend to hold as much of our ancestral homes here as we can. And there&rsquo;s even more good news, not widely-enough known outside of California, which is that we ARE holding entire towns and areas right now, big areas. This is no lost cause here. Heck, there are actually patriots moving BACK here to join in the critical California part of our people&rsquo;s campaign. These determined folks are, in an important way, like the 700 Thespians who didn&rsquo;t have to stand with Leonidas and the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, but did. The Thespians marched there, and stood with their kinsmen even when bidden to return to their homes by the Spartans. In three days all 1,000 were defeated  utterly. Or so it seemed. And yet&hellip;and yet&hellip;what the world&rsquo;s most massive non-White army to that time, fully intent on taking Europe, immediately knew, was that the Spartan patriots weren&rsquo;t defeated at all. No, the European patriots won. As we will, again. We brothers, sisters&hellip;Spartans, Thespians&hellip;even Californians.</p>

<p>I have noticed that many commentators have expressed concern over mistreatment committed by Asians against Caucasians.</p>
<p>Try Googling the following search string:<br>
[are asians smarter than whites?]<br>
One would find the usual plethora of articles addressing the aforementioned question, but one article does stand out that is worthy to note because it addresses an all-too-pervasive but overlooked phenomenon:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dark Side of the Asian American &#8216;Model Student&rsquo; - NAM&#8221;<br>
https://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=b89773ee251042d994e23ca0fd927512<br>
Here are few excerpts:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;<br>
For example, Professor Stacey Lee of University of Wisconsin, who studied one particular high school found that high-achieving middle-class white students respect the academic talents of their peers. Some, however, hold up the successes of Asian-Americans to dismiss African-American students&rsquo; charges of racial discrimination in America. In addition, she found that low-achieving, working-class white students are more likely to refer to students of Asian descent as &ldquo;chinks and gooks&rdquo; who are invading their school. And some African-American students believe that the success of Asian-American students has been achieved at the expense of their own.<br>
 <br>
According to another study, Asian-American college students say that positive stereotypes that non-Asians have of them focus on educational achievement only. Most of the stereotypes, they say, are negative, such as non-Asians&rsquo; perceptions that Asians &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak English well,&rdquo; &ldquo;have accents,&rdquo; and are &ldquo;submissive,&rdquo; &ldquo;sneaky,&rdquo; &ldquo;stingy,&rdquo; &ldquo;greedy,&rdquo; etc.<br>
 <br>
Here, the seemingly positive stereotypes conceal negative stereotypes casting Asian American students as &ldquo;perpetual foreigners.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
As a researcher of Asian American issues, I recently conducted a survey at the University of Houston on campus perceptions of Asian-American and Asian international students, with more than 750 student participants. A preliminary analysis shows that non-Asian students perceive students of Asian descent as &ldquo;model students&rdquo; and more often than not as a homogeneous group with more similarities than differences. Non-Asian students also have unfavorable impression of both Asian-American and Asian international students, saying, for example, that students of Asian descent are hard to make friends with. <br>
&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is any of this familiar?</p>
<p>It is quite simple.  Asian American students eventually grow up to be Asian American adults.  Since Asian American students are generally good students, they have a special talent for remembering things   &mdash;   even things that were very distasteful.  So, if Asian American students are mistreated when young, they will remember such mistreatment when they are older and in a position to exact restitution.</p>
<p>As far as Caucasians should be concerned, the solution is also quite simple: Stop mistreating young Asian Americans (and, for that matter, old ones too).</p>
<p>Well, it is probably too late to make any lasting change, thereby making the whole concept quite moot.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is talk of the American Dollar as no longer being the standard currency for the world and that a basket of currencies should be used as the standard currency for the world.  Would anyone like to venture a guess as to whose currency will be the strongest in that basket?</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

			<p>Memphomaniac, you speak of a misconception common among our kinsmen, which is that we Californian White folks are especially blameworthy&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the reason that the non-White invaders picked California to launch their invasion.   Because, being free to go anywhere &hellip;they say to themselves: hey, this California place is great &hellip;let&rsquo;s steal this White man&rsquo;s heaven. The greatest natural harbors on Earth, the greatest agricultural valleys on Earth, the best climate on Earth, the richest State on Earth, the greatest university system ever built, forests, mountains, rivers, water, ocean, beaches, minerals, crops, power, naively nice White sucker guys, naively nice pretty White women&hellip;We&rsquo;ll get to all the other States in due course.</p>
<p>please keep in mind that there are still about 17 million White folks in what remains by far the most White-populous State in America. <br>
***********************************<br>
Great post from  J. Kelso!  I have always liked California, as he says one of the world&rsquo;s prime pieces of real estate,  and seeing what it&rsquo;s being turned into  has filled me with sadness.  Of course, this is what&rsquo;s scheduled for all of us, in due time.   I had initially agreed with Memphomaniac, but having read the above post, I&rsquo;ve come over to Kelso&rsquo;s point of view.  Yes, the main fault lies with those who control our immigration policy, not with those who bear the brunt of it.  The latter are victims, not perpetrators.  I will grant that they should have been more careful in the election of their so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221;.  But so should all of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our country&rsquo;s  fault for allowing  immigrants to flood into the most attractive, pleasant, desirable parts of the country, and then to move freely anywhere they want and flood and congest those places with immigrants to the point of outnumbering the locals.  What sane country would allow that?   That is sheer madness.    (How many immigrants are choosing to go to North Dakota or Northern Maine?)  We should have regulated this immigration much more stringently (if  we needed to have it at all), allowing them to reach only a certain percentage and then no more.  Instead, we have passively let them take over whole areas and cities (eg. San Jose, Cal&rsquo;s 3rd largest city, larger than San Francisco). </p>
<p>Ordinary Californians did not invite these people in.  The heads of those Silicon Valley companies did (and still do), but they are not the ordinary people. They are another thing.   And so are Senators Feinstein and Boxer. And others like Pelosi and Sherman. [Pelosi and Boxer were not born Californians.]   Once again we see a glaring example here of what is going on nearly everywhere: that the state&rsquo;s politicians do not represent, or identify with, its people.  Nor could they care less about us.  The government has become our enemy. It is regularly opposed to the interests of the Majority (which it is determined to make a minority).</p>
<p>And speaking of majority/minority, Kelso also makes an excellent point that - despite the alien invasion - California still has more white people than any other state. Let&rsquo;s not just give up and write it off.   It&rsquo;s too valuable to lose.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s too far off. The whole system put in place by those who seek to destroy whites in the US and the West is in fact starting to crumble. It&rsquo;s only going to get worse, first for whites, then eventually for the people in charge as whites are being backed into a corner. As usual, whites are slow to act, think, and anger in a collective group. But when they do, the other side loses. It will happen again. No doubt about it. None whatsoever. It&rsquo;s the pain and suffering that our people are going to <b>have</b> to endure to get to the end of this that is the sad part. </p>
<p>As for &#8220;Electrical Engineer&#8221; and his hot air:  all of the tales of woe from various non-whites, including Asians, generally turn out to be false. Google the fake hate crimes perpetrated by Asians, particularly Asian women. When caught, it&rsquo;s always the excuse that they were trying to &#8220;&hellip;raise awareness&#8221;. The same excuse we get from blacks, hispanics, feminists and gays when caught red-handed executing a fake hate crime. EVERYONE in the US has faced some kind of discrimination or experienced being made of, especially as children. Usually as a child I should add. That&rsquo;s the way it is. </p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t that Asians remember being picked on, so they pick on whites as adults. It&rsquo;s that they are now adults who realize they can attack whites with relative impunity on many levels, protected by the system currently in place. They are also getting more aggressive as their numbers grow. Witness the behavior of Asian gangbangers in Monterey Park near Los Angeles for example. Witness the blatant ethno-cronyism by Asians in the tech industry, something that whites could never, ever get away with. Electrical Engineer has it backwards. With everything starting to come apart at the seams, it&rsquo;s whites who are now waking up, seeing how they&rsquo;ve been carrying more and more non-whites, starting with blacks and now it&rsquo;s Asians, Arabs, Indians, Mara Salvatrucha pygmies and more. If everyone else were really so much better, smarter, top of the line compared to whites they wouldn&rsquo;t fight tooth and nail to come to the West, especially the horrible US, where the racial spoils system caters to any and all non-whites, ensuring that they breed. Breed to replace whites. Let them put their lies, self aggrandizement, high self-esteem and all other elements of their being to work by building up their own countries. Because that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re headed in the not too distant future. It&rsquo;s only their arrogance combined with their ignorance of real history that leads them believe otherwise. </p>
<p>The old system and the old US is going down. Whites are being forced into viewing themselves as a distinct ethnic group. If these people don&rsquo;t think that a non-white population in the US of 50 - 55% is going to lose out to angry whites they are silly. The &#8220;minorities&#8221; will never, ever become cohesive, not even to fight whites. Their masters dream for it, but it won&rsquo;t happen. Because they all think they&rsquo;re better than each other, and better than whitey. Laugh now. You won&rsquo;t be laughing in ten years. </p>

			<p>The Aggrieved Oriental Electrical Engineer has brought forth some intellectual cud for us to chew.  Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;<br>
     &#8220;Some Whites hold up the success of Asian-Americans to dismiss African-American students&rsquo; charges of racial discrimination&hellip;&#8221;  What&rsquo;s wrong with that?  Are we supposed to ignore the evidence before us?   If non-Whites can come from the far side of the world and do better than non-Whites who have lived among us for centuries, it either demonstrates that Orientals are not discriminated against, or that Blacks are inferior, or perhaps both.  <br>
     &#8220;&hellip;low achieving White working class students are more likely to refer to students of Asian descent as &#8216;Chinks and Gooks&rsquo; who are invading their school.&#8221;  I would think that anyone familiar with recent Chinese history would recognize class antagonism when they saw it.  In any all White school, there will be some animosity between the A students who take trig and English lit, and the C students who take general math and shop.  The A students are praised, honored, and when high school is over, they get to go away to college.  The C students are tolerated and they go to work at McDonald&rsquo;s.  Sports teams are possibly the only place where they get adult respect, and nothing is more lame than a high school football hero who has turned 19.  His best days are already behind him.  These class distinctions will likely be with these kids all of their lives, and they know it.  If the higher class kids are from a different race, that&rsquo;s just frosting on the cake.  No one would expect Chinese peasant kids to get along with college-bound White kids who somehow came to be in their school.  The AOEE is seeing a racial conflict that is primarily a class struggle.  <br>
     &#8220;Non-Asian students perceive students of Asian descent as&hellip;a homogenous group with more similarities than differences.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s a grievance?  Then what are we to think of an Oriental who refers to &#8220;Whites&#8221;?  Is that not perceiving us as a homogenous group with more similarities than differences?  I am aware that Chinese and Japanese and Koreans can tell one another apart, and that some Whites who have lived in the Orient can do the same, but I can&rsquo;t.  So what, are Whites to be condemned because we don&rsquo;t share the Orientals intra-racial rivalries?  Has any poster here ever ridiculed Vietnamese because they couldn&rsquo;t tell a Pole from an Irishman?  <br>
     &#8220;&hellip;saying, for example, that students of Asian descent are hard to make friends with.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t think that any intelligent person ought be surprised that when people from different cultures with different values meet, it is harder to become friends than if they shared a common culture.  I once inadvertently offended a West Virginian by drinking only two beers, when he had been planning to get drunk.  I could scarcely imagine the many ways I might accidently insult a Japanese.  <br>
     The real issue here is that some Orientals choose to make a huge deal over the ordinary conflicts of social relations between people of different origins.  Maybe there&rsquo;s something to that stereotype of Orientals inordinate fear of losing face.  And the AOEE threatens us that these traumatized Orientals will grow up and get even.  Perhaps, though if people actually grow up, they don&rsquo;t nurse these kinds of juvenile grudges.  I suppose it&rsquo;s all the more reason to send them back now.  </p>

			<p>Schoolteacher, I grew up in Los Angeles, and can tell the Chinese from the Japanese from the Koreans, Filipinos, Thais, Vietnamese etc with ease. They do in fact look different. But I honestly don&rsquo;t feel they belong here. They are in fact becoming more aggressive on the streets and in politics. The &#8220;Hot Gates&#8221; (funny name, this might have to become Sparta) is right. Now that they have the numbers and confidence, they&rsquo;re playing the racial spoils game. They&rsquo;re smarter on average than Mexicans and blacks so they&rsquo;ll play it a lot better. Just more trouble for white people. It&rsquo;s coming apart here in Southern California, and it will in the rest of the country, despite all the arrogant people who think it won&rsquo;t. Whites need to be ready, because we will have the chance to take it all back. But it&rsquo;s going to be our only chance for a long time so we&rsquo;d better make the best of it when we&rsquo;re up to bat. When the economy hits rock bottom, it will be our turn at the plate. </p>

			<p>This is in regard to the posting by the agrieved Oriental Electrical Engineer. Mr. agrieved Oriental Electrical Engineer, I need to be intellectually honest with you. Your analysis does not appear to demonstrate what one might call astute erudition. Especially regarding your theory on why Asians are paying back white Americans.  This particulaly weak explanation collapses upon a cursory inspection. According to you, Dr. so and so does a study at one high school in which she draws conclusions that she may apply to all American high schools. Do you know there are nearly 28,000 high schools in this country? I don&rsquo;t think a survey at one school qualifies in any way as what we generally think of when we think of research. But for the sake of argument I&rsquo;ll go along with this assumption. So the smart white kids who attend class with the Asian kids appreciate and respect the intelligence of the Asians. The dumb white kids don&rsquo;t, and in one survey it is purported that they might use words like gook or chink. But how often would these words actually reach the ears of the Asian students? Maybe they use them during their private conversations much the way blacks use the terms honkey and cracker more often when out of earshot of whites. Or how sometimes at work when I want to go out for Chinese food at lunch time, and I ask my white coworkers, &#8220;Hey you guys want to go get some gook-chew?&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve never used this term in front of any Asians. Anyway according to your theory, years later these Asians, bitter over their high school experiences, would seek retribution against whites by denying them job opportunities. You forget that Asians like CorvairXF92 appreciate subtleties; therefore, they would have noticed that it was the dumb white kids who used words like gook or chink, and not the smart white kids in their Calculus or Physics classes. They would also be intelligent enough to know that the white Americans applying for high tech jobs would be the smart ones, rather than the dumb ones who may or may not have actually used words such as chink or gook. Therefore, these smart, white American applicants would not be in need of any Asian based job discrimination or other payback or recriminations. The smart, white American job applicants would be denied job opportunities by Asians like CorvairXF92 for not having played the violin, for playing baseball, and for possibly having the &#8216;big tough engineer&rsquo;attitude. Basically they would be discriminated against solely on the basis of cultural differences as well as the fact that Asians prefer their own kind (as many groups most naturally do).</p>
<p>I want to explain to you what I find most offensive about your posting.  It&rsquo;s your attitude of &#8216;it&rsquo;s the evil white racists getting what they deserve&rsquo; and &#8216;only whites are racists&rsquo;. Believe me, Asians say plenty about whites behind their backs. I&rsquo;m sure if a white attended a Chinese high school or Japanese high school it would be no picnic. Besides, if we were such racists, why are all these Asians here in this country? Do you <br>
know an American cannot become a citizen of Japan, Korea, China, or India? Why do you suppose that is the case, if whites are the only racists? </p>
<p>Something that struck me as a bit odd in your post is the fact that you thank CorvairXF92. Why would you thank this person for explaining why he doesn&rsquo;t like whites, why he doesn&rsquo;t like diversity, and why he prefers his own kind? Considering what this country has given him, and his attitude to those who made his life here in the United States possible, he doesn&rsquo;t warrant gratitude from any American. I am glad that he helped to convey my position on diversity (that it doesn&rsquo;t work despite the great potential that it holds not counting the limitations of all human beings), but I&rsquo;m not grateful to him.</p>
<p>One more thing Mr. Agrieved Oriental Electrical Engineer. Are you a sure you&rsquo;re up to the task of fulfilling the role of a competent researcher?  You are an electrical engineer by degree perhaps?  But you&rsquo;ve had no training in doing research studies, and your biased opinions prevent any sort of objectivity in your results. Hmm. Are you sure you&rsquo;re not just a left-wing, liberal fanatic who enjoys surfing the web and reading about social issues?</p>
<p>Regarding this comment by Joe: &#8220;Why does the moderator allow this site to fill up with anti-white posts from asians? Amren is turning into a joke.&#8221; Joe, this is okay.  I, and a number of other conservatives who frequent this site, always enjoy a good game of mental badminton in which we always win.  Of course trying to change the beliefs of liberal, muticultural fanatics is a fools errand.  In almost every instance I have observed they seem to take the position, &#8220;don&rsquo;t confuse me with facts, my mind&rsquo;s made up!&#8221;.  Impassioned, bleeding hearts don&rsquo;t provide much in the way of objective, logical analysis. Besides, tolerating criticism is one of the hallmarks of successful white societies.  Failed cultures such as many we see in Africa fail to ever achieve any sort of tolerance to opposing opinions. No doubt you&rsquo;ve seen many of the bloody results of such intolerance. Besides, we need more, not less, freedom of speech in this country.  Far too many foreign cultures cannot grasp this particular concept.<br>
