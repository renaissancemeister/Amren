<h1>Barnes and (Ig)Noble White Supremacy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher, Parrhesia, March 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} After quickly ascertaining that Barnes and Noble did not, in fact, carry Michael Eric Dyson&rsquo;s work (a feat that I wholly anticipated) I spent a few moments perfunctorily scanning book titles belonging to the Ethnic Studies section, a genre whose scope is quite large and entails sub-genres. I was both chagrined and intrigued to find that nearly all of the titles under the Urban Studies/Criminology typological system addressed issues of criminal activity perpetrated by African Americans and Latinos to the exclusion of any other ethnic faction.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more grievous than this conspicuous partisan imbalance in racial representation is the fact that this section was prodigiously stocked with twelve copies (more copies than any other publication in this genre) of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s book entitled <cite>Paved with Good Intentions: The Failure of Race Relations in Contemporary America.</cite> Ever heard of it? <cite>Paved with Good Intentions</cite> was published in the late 1990&rsquo;s by Mr. Jared Taylor, a self-identified White Nationalist/Supremacist and &#8220;racial realist.&#8221; After the release of Taylor&rsquo;s seminal piece, David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the KKK, exalted Taylor, writing, &#8221; [he] is a man of immense ability and the courage commensurate and necessary for telling the long-suppressed truths of race&#8221; (www.davidduke.com). Let us also for the moment consider the banality of bigotry that punctuates Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s reflection on Hurricane Katrina and FEMA&rsquo;s lack of preparation and response. Mr. Taylor states &#8220;when blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization  &mdash;  any kind of civilization  &mdash;  disappears. And in a crisis, civilization disappears overnight&#8221; (www.amren.com). I won&rsquo;t any longer belabor my appraisal of Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s character, although suffice it to say that as an anti-racist white ally the very last book I wanted to encounter before my six hour flight was <cite>Paved with Good Intentions</cite> by Jared Taylor.</p>
<p>Before leaving Barnes and Noble I hastily grabbed an edition from the shelf and located a sales associate. As I approached her I politely asked, &#8220;How often would you say that people purchase this book?&#8221; She took a closer look at the title and casually responded, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure but I bet that we sell at least three or four a week.&#8221; Appalled, but not surprised, I thanked the kind women for her time, returned the book to its shelf, and agitatedly left the store. The sales associate with whom I spoke confirmed the accuracy of my presentiment  &mdash;  people are still buying this book with regularity nearly a decade after its initial publication .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they&rsquo;re still masticating Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s rhetorical filth. If you are unfamiliar with Taylor&rsquo;s racist text I will begin by framing two of his most foundational assumptions and will then offer a penetrating riposte for the purpose of countervailing the inimical ideologies, pernicious pathologies, and specious statistics spewing from <cite>Paved with Good Intentions. </cite></p>
<p>When it comes to manufacturing fabrications of the most duplicitous degree, few can compete with white supremacists like Mr. Taylor. <cite>Paved with Good Intentions</cite> is likely one of the most popular pieces of contemporary racist propaganda, and because it relies on &#8220;official government data,&#8221; it comes across as temperate, intelligent social science, (Taylor graduated from Yale in 1973) rather than as an abridgment of rhetorical garbage and twisted claims sponsored by spurious figures that it happens to be. Taylor&rsquo;s racist assertions are for too copious in number to address here fully, and so I will identify two of his most iniquitous claims and debunk them below. I hope you have your doggy bags .&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claim #1: Blacks are much more dangerous than whites as evidenced by higher crime rates;</p>
<p>Claim #2: (as a direct corollary of #1) Black crime rates sufficiently justify racial profiling, since it only makes sense to focus law enforcement attention on those who commit a disproportionate share of crime.</p>
<p>An exhaustive examination of these arguments evinces the notion that Taylor and his followers are either statistically illiterate or daringly dissembling. First, as for the disproportionate rate of violent crime committed by blacks, economic conditions and blatant disparities in income, wealth, and the ease with which particular communities can cultivate assets all help to explain the difference with white crime rates. According to several studies, when community and personal economic status is comparable between whites and blacks, there are no significant racial crime differences. In other words, the unspoken message of Taylor&rsquo;s assertion  &mdash;  that blacks are dangerous because they are black  &mdash;  is untenable. Stated clearly, violence is predicated on poverty, not pigmentation. (By the way, the same sort of comparisons can be posited with regard to popular standardized tests. Persons of the same economic class background perform similarly on these tests regardless of color, ethnicity, etc. A study was released by ETS a few years ago suggested that statistically middle-class African American students and statistically middle-class white students performed within a 2% margin of one another on the SAT.) Secondly, to claim that African Americans are more dangerous than white folks because of official crime rates is to elide the insight that when it comes to quotidian threats to personal salubriousness, whites far and away lead the pack in all kinds of destructive behaviors: corporate pollution, consumer fraud, violations of health and safety standards on the job, and launching wars on the basis of deceptive evidence, to name a few. Each year, far more people die because of corporate malfeasance, occupational health violations and pollution than all the street crime combined, let alone street crime committed by African Americans. (Wise, 2002)</p>
<p>As for profiling, Mr. Taylor insists that because of vaulted rates of crime for members of the African American and Hispanic/Latino communities, it is only shrewd to focus police efforts and the allocation of financial resources on the &#8220;darker communities.&#8221; (Taylor&rsquo;s words) But this is demonstrably preposterous. If, as the Justice Department data suggests, African Americans and Latinos commit somewhere between 22-27% of violent crime in most years, then to profile African Americans and Latinos for crime will result in police being wrong, between 73-78% of the time. (Wise, 2002) Let me also remind you that African Americans comprise about 13.5% of the population and those who classify themselves as Hispanic/Latino make up approximately 14.5% of the domestic population. Taken together, these two factions compose about 28% of the U.S. population and such an aggregate figure is correspondingly lower than the proportion one would expect given an even correlation between population and rates of violent crimes. Of course, many know that the number of African Americans and Hispanic Americans/Latinos incarcerated in state of federal prisons is disproportionately high, but let&rsquo;s us remember not to conflate (nor inflate) the rate of violent crimes with the rate of incarceration for these factions. And of course, as anti-racist Tim Wise eloquently contends, &#8220;Profiling is not the typical method for uncovering serious already-committed crimes anyway, since solving such crimes logically involves using incident-specific information. Profiling is, instead, too often done as a way to uncover crimes, such as drug possession, that have yet to come to police attention&#8221; (Wise, 2002). As for drugs, there can be no doubt that profiling is irrational. According to federal data, African Americans are only 13.5 percent of drug users, while non-Hispanic whites are over 70 percent of users. (Wise 2002) So to profile African Americans, for instance, for drugs is to guarantee limited success in actually uncovering drug crimes.</p>
<p>What I find most appalling is that a number of recent studies are beginning to suggest that white perceptions of African American and Latino criminality play a prominent role in furthering racism, both attitudinally and institutionally (in terms of support for racially disparate and exorbitant crime policies). Therefore, my obligation to refute statistics that propel forward both personal bigotry and institutional racism carries with it important personal and policy implications. Even though, as some may argue, Barnes and Noble was simply responding to market pressures by stocking this nocuous text, I&rsquo;m nonetheless highly disappointed in the store. Of course, to be fair, I&rsquo;m even more ashamed that my fellow citizens reliably purchase <cite>Paved with Good Intentions</cite> and unknowingly read it with tendentious insouciance. I wish I weren&rsquo;t compelled to write such an entry, but given the potency of institutional racism as a defining force in American life, I can hardly afford the luxury of turning a blind eye to such racist and statistically misleading positions. As Elie Wiesel writes, &#8220;Indifference is the greatest evil&#8221; and the sad fact is that our indifference to confronting &#8220;scholarship&#8221; like Taylor&rsquo;s merely re-certifies his work as legitimate. I am well aware that American racism already enjoys plenty of legitimacy, with or without a refutation, but I can say in moments of hope and courage that responding to it cogently and forcefully might dissuade ideologically pliable minds from accepting the perverse logic of white supremacists like Mr. Taylor.<br>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t Barnes and Noble the same bookstore behind the wisecrack that the person who put a book about monkeys in the Obama section should be prosecuted for a hate crime?</p>
<p>This &#8220;Christopher&#8221; reminds me of the person I lovingly call Eddie Haskell (anti-neo-Confederate), in that they both are looking to be hired by the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, or someone like that.  So they&rsquo;ll blog with Deesesque language.  </p>

			<p>Oh how brilliant.  Keep repeating the same old lies over and over again until people just assume you must be right.  That is the leftist strategy and that is Mr. Parrhesia&rsquo;s strategy.  His notions of poverty = crime and poverty = low test scores have been debunked many times over.  But, true to his leftist ideology, he won&rsquo;t let facts get in the way.  Did he even READ Paved with Good Intentions?  Obviously not.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s funny. Here&rsquo;s an idea: pit each of those &#8220;destructive behaviors&#8221; against being beaten to a bloody pulp and robbed/raped by one or more (usually more) angry blacks because you happened to be white and on their turf, and see which one you opt to suffer each and every time.</p>
<p>BTW, as for that assertion about wars based on deceptive evidence, the author must be supremely ignorant of the history of American inner city gang wars and indeed the entire African continent. Admittedly though, whites are far better at it.</p>
<p><i>Each year, far more people die because of corporate malfeasance, occupational health violations and pollution than all the street crime combined, let alone street crime committed by African Americans. (Wise, 2002)</i></p>
<p>Conveniently vague and impossible to prove/disprove. Let me ask though: when corner boys get shot in the process of working the dope game, does that also count as an &#8220;occupational health violation?&#8221; &gt;;)</p>

			<p>No Christopher, you are not &#8216;an anti-racist white ally.&rsquo; You are a racist anti-white ally. </p>
<p>In the original story, we learn Christopher and his pretentious comp lit vocabulary went into the store to buy &#8220;a copy of Michael Eric Dyson&rsquo;s Know What I Mean: Reflections on Hip Hop, a text that [he] plans to employ in one of the courses that I will be teaching this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you need to know about him. He&rsquo;s just a standard issue, unemployable neo-Marxist jester straight from university central casting. If he were half as urbane and witty as he thinks he is he could have been a coffee shop extra on Frasier.</p>

			<p>Behind every violent criminal act committed by a black stands a white apologist.   Not only are they liars they are the most hypocritical people around.  If violent crime is caused by poverty, then why isn&rsquo;t Appalachia the most dangerous place in the country?   </p>

			<p>This &ldquo;Academic&rdquo; provides much needed humor as we suffer through the first year of Pharaohs&rsquo; rule. He certainly is in love with his own vocabulary, but like all true believers in the religion of diversity and multiculturalism, he doesn&rsquo;t allow logic and facts to alter his opinions.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Secondly, to claim that African Americans are more dangerous than white folks because of official crime rates is to elide the insight that when it comes to quotidian threats to personal salubriousness,&#8221;<br>
 You can do as you wish, but to ignore a black crime rate ten times that of whites is lunacy.</p>
<p> &#8220;whites far and away lead the pack in all kinds of destructive behaviors: corporate pollution, consumer fraud, violations of health and safety standards on the job, and launching wars on the basis of deceptive evidence, to name a few. Each year, far more people die because of corporate malfeasance, occupational health violations and pollution than all the street crime combined, let alone street crime committed by African Americans.&#8221; (Wise, 2002)<br>
So you condemn anyone who suggests that crime rates vary by race, then you turn around and without any statistics condemn whites for all these horrible crimes, right? Oh I forgot you that  don&rsquo;t want to mislead with government statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I find most appalling is that a number of recent studies are beginning to suggest that white perceptions of African American and Latino criminality play a prominent role in furthering racism, both attitudinally and institutionally (in terms of support for racially disparate and exorbitant crime policies).&#8221; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we in the race awareness movement call progress. Please keep up this dribble, it provides amusement and show the enemy for the fools they are.<br>

<p>Ah, I see, once again, it&rsquo;s &#8220;Whitey&rsquo;s fault.&#8221; Did it ever occur to this genius that the tendency towards crime is what <i>causes</i> these communities to be poor in the first place?</p>
<p><i>According to several studies, when community and personal economic status is comparable between whites and blacks, there are no significant racial crime differences.</i></p>
<p>Remarkable! In other words, when you separate out the most law-abiding, hardest-working blacks and compare them to the white community as a whole, the crime rates are comparable. Who&rsquo;da thunk it? This is just another case of comparing the exceptional to the average, instead of comparing average to average, which is what any rational person wants to do.</p>

<p>Just as I am eternally bemused that, in the &#8220;Ethnic Studies&#8221; section of my university&rsquo;s library, books on &#8220;Why (the white) Race Doesn&rsquo;t Exist&#8221; stand alongside books on &#8220;Why (white) Europe/America NEED Racial Diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p><i> Let us also for the moment consider the banality of bigotry that punctuates Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s reflection on Hurricane Katrina and FEMA&rsquo;s lack of preparation and response. Mr. Taylor states &ldquo;when blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization &mdash; any kind of civilization &mdash; disappears. And in a crisis, civilization disappears overnight&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>It still amuses that that - when flooding occurs in majority-white communities in the Mid-West - there is little crime, few casualties and the residents say &#8220;we will rebuild&#8221; through the tears. Yet when flooding occurs in the majority-black community of New Orleans-<br>
Well, I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ve all read the eyewitness account provided by American Renaissance.</p>
<p><i>According to several studies, when community and personal economic status is comparable between whites and blacks, there are no significant racial crime differences.</i></p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S why the state with a population that was 94.6% &#8220;white&#8221; ranked&hellip;<a href="http://www.netstate.com/states/alma/wv_alma.htm" rel="nofollow">48th and 51st out of 50 states for violent and property crimes repectively</a>.</p>

			<p>I actually think this clown probably increased sales of the book for the entire year with his repeat of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s honest and realistic synopsis of blacks and their response to Hurricane Katrina.  I would like to see what this knucklehead looks like but he&rsquo;s hiding behind a first name only.  He needs to take a stroll down Lenox Avenue and see how many racists he encountered.  But this type of paleface hides in lily-white areas and any contact with minorities are the more educated less hostile variety which makes up a very small percentage of the blacks and browns.<br>

			<p>When has Jared Taylor described himself as a &#8220;white supremacist?&#8221; This little twerp can&rsquo;t even get basic facts right. He does follow the argument-avoiding tactics of his hero, Tim Wise, by redefining elements of the debate and by special pleading (&#8220;economic conditions&#8221; are to blame, and so on). </p>

			<p>If it&rsquo;s true that &#8220;Paved&#8221; is still selling at this rate, it&rsquo;s a remarkable testament to the honesty and truthfulness of the work.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Mr. Taylor states &ldquo;when blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization &mdash; any kind of civilization &mdash; disappears. And in a crisis, civilization disappears overnight&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Christopher doesn&rsquo;t make any effort to dispute this factual statement because a) he can&rsquo;t and b) the facts stand on their own. Black behavior is universal. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a nation in Africa or a neighborhood in the United States, the outcomes are the same. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to me how these people have to twist reality to fit their theories. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s saying, &#8216;if you stand on your head and squint your eyes, black and white crime rates are identical&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Christopher, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you might want to check out this link:</p>
<p>http://www.ojp.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another way to see reality. Go to your favorite search engine and type in a string like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; &#8220;Police Department&#8221; Name of any city.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one for St. Louis:</p>
<p>http://www.co.st-louis.mo.us/scripts/police/ten/index.cfm</p>
<p>Or this one for Salt Lake City:</p>
<p>http://www.slcpd.com/getinformed/mostwanted.html</p>
<p>Atlanta:</p>
<p>http://www.atlantapd.org/index.asp?nav=mw</p>
<p>I suppose Christopher can explain that the only thing any of these people are guilty of is being profiled by the police. The question is, how do you profile people for being wanted on charges of violent crimes?</p>
<p>The only way to explain how someone can look at reality and not see reality while trying to explain it away with convoluted theories is that this person mentally unstable (as if evident by Christophers&rsquo; manic style of writing) and has to lie to themselves because the reality and the truth are too much for them to accept. Christopher could likely argue that up is down, left is right just as easily as he says black crime rates are the same as white crime rates.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said many times, liberalism is a kind of mental illness characterized by a denial of reality. Christopher is a good example of this.</p>
<p>BTW: As I write this, there are no comments posted on the orginal link. If Christopher is inviting comments, he should be reading ours:</p>

			<p>I would like to see Mr Parrhesia explain away Africa as easily.  </p>
<p>With amazing social equalizing reason, he forgets about Ireland, when people were starving there, they pulled together and got on boats and went somewhere esle. One thing they did not do was riot and demand food and shelter.  Once in the U.S., after a short period of struggle as all immigrants have had, they made themselves one of the greatest successes in history as any ethnic group ever.  My question to Mr. Parrhesia is: Why do Blacks continue to be such failures when they have had more than anyone in the history of this country been handed everything, now even the presidency?  Must we become South Africa or Zimbabwe before people like you get it?</p>

			<p>First,I&rsquo;d like to establish a minor bonafide  &mdash;  mentioned only because it&rsquo;s relevant for this one post: I&rsquo;m a member of MENSA. I have written several books. I have a couple of degrees. </p>
<p>I went to this guy&rsquo;s blog to read the full piece. It was the silliest and most childish drivel imaginable.  He sounds like a high school dropout who tries to impress his pals after looking up a couple of words in a dictionary.</p>
<p>I ran across a phony like this a few years ago as the phony was talking to someone else.  </p>
<p>The phony was trying to show that he was an intellectual and also somewhat bohemian. </p>
<p>The part I remember of the conversation was the phony telling the other person that the phony had spent a good deal of time in Greenwich Village.  The problem was that the phony pronounced it: GREEN WITCH Village. </p>

			<p> &#8220;Christopher&#8221; wastes an awful lot of effort and space proving to us that he is conceited who believes he is both dazzlingly articulate and amazingly tolerant. Of everyone except conservatives and White nationalists, that is.</p>
<p> He does not seem to realize that when he learns that &#8220;three or four copies a week&#8221; of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s book are sold at one bookstore, this proves that the book not only has a continuing popularity with the public in general, but also makes perfectly good sense to them/us. No, to &#8220;Christopher&#8221; it proves only that we are, sadly, still &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobic.&#8221; His writing is like some clever conservative&rsquo;s satirical takeoff on something written by a top-lofty, left-leaning sachem from Academe. But, sadly, Christopher&rsquo;s deadly serious.</p>

<p>Or why isn&rsquo;t The Depression known as the most violent period in American history? (You can be assured the coming New Depression won&rsquo;t be quite as peaceful).</p>
<p>The MSM and $PLC axiomatically refer to ANY White advocacy group as promoters of White Supremacy  &mdash;  conjuring up images of goose-stepping, skin-headed, tattooed Nazis or hooded Klansmen at a lynching. And of course, ALL of these tim wise-type articles MUST make mention of David Duke. </p>
<p>Non-White/ethnic-based advocacy groups are referred to as &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; organizations   &mdash;  Civil Rights for whom?  For everyone, or only THEIR own people  &mdash;  is not LaRaza an advocate ONLY for those &#8216;inside the race?&rsquo; (and for everyone else, nothing?) And that isn&rsquo;t a form of race-based supremacy?</p>
<p>As Christopher Donovon notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Southern Poverty Law Center uses the term (White supremacist) because they want to discredit white advocates and frighten its base into making large donations.  It works because it sounds scary&hellip;&#8221; </p>

			<p>I read Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Paved With Good Intentions</i> years ago.  It is factually accurate, well written, and has none of the hatefulness exhibited by Christopher Parrhesia.  Mr. Parrhesia seems to think that a mere assertion (blacks commit crimes because they are poor, and their being poor is whitey&rsquo;s fault) is somehow akin to an actual logical refutation of Taylor&rsquo;s claims.  This is what passes for thought among the left.</p>

			<p>It is painful to read such bad writing.  Obviously, the author is a  pretentious windbag trying to be both witty and righteous. But true wit, as Aristotle tells us, is a moral (conversational) virtue.  As such, real wit presupposes a degree of intelligence and goodness far beyond the actualized capacities of this Leftist buffoon.</p>
<p>I wonder: Is such pathetic scribbling what is to pass for high humour during the reign of the dark Emperor Darth Obama?</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think hammering lefties with facts about crime and intelligence can hope to accomplish anything.  People determined to believe in equality will find a way  to believe in it no matter what.  I prefer the tack Mr. Taylor has more recently taken, demonstrating that aside from a few superficial delights diversity is not a strength at all.  Whatever the paltry benefits of diversity they can&rsquo;t make up for the damage it otherwise does.  Not even the greatest determination to &#8220;see&#8221; diversity as a strength can cover up its faults.  So if diversity isn&rsquo;t a strength then it should be reversed, undone   &mdash;   to the benefit of all.  Contrary to what lefties like to believe, diversity doesn&rsquo;t benefit blacks: they are getting clobbered by latinos and will suffer even more as latino numbers increase.  Others who think they benefit from diversity are similarly deluding themselves; disconnected from cultural roots, their lives are spent flailing about in a turbulent sea of anomie.  </p>

			<p><i>Oh how brilliant. Keep repeating the same old lies over and over again until people just assume you must be right. That is the leftist strategy and that is Mr. Parrhesia&rsquo;s strategy. His notions of poverty = crime and poverty = low test scores have been debunked many times over. But, true to his leftist ideology, he won&rsquo;t let facts get in the way.

			<p>I used to be a lot like Christopher.</p>
<p>I grew up in a quiet suburb and the schools that I went to were 90-95% white.  There were a few black students, but for the most part, they behaved just like the white students.  I also remembered most of them being very popular with the students and with the teachers.  We all would have been horrified if someone would have treated them badly because of the color of their skin because in our minds, they were just like us and they were part of our community.  Other than this handful of students, my only other exposure to the black community was through watching television shows like &#8220;the Cosby Show&#8221; and &#8220;the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.&#8221;  I thought that racism was a sign of low intelligence and I associated those attitudes with poor whites.  </p>
<p>My attitudes changed as I got a little older.  In high school, I started working as a cashier in a movie theater.  About 40% of the customers were black.  I began noticing differences between black customers and white customers in terms of their attitudes and behavior.  For example, if an audience was primarily black, there would be a lot more trash left behind in the auditorium after the movie ended.  The black customers were also more likely to let their children run around unsupervised.  They were also the most likely to complain to the managers and to demand freebies.  I also saw differences in the work ethic of my black coworkers.  At first, I felt really guilty for noticing these differences and I tried to come up with all sorts of excuses to justify their behavior.  I also began to get the impression that many blacks have a strong sense of anger and resentment towards whites and no matter how polite you are or how many concessions you make to them, it will never be good enough.  </p>
<p>When I started college, I lived in a dorm.  The college that I attend prides itself on diversity and they go out of their way to recruit minorities.  About 1/3 of the students living in my dorm were black.  The black residents were a lot louder than the white residents, they had no respect for &#8220;quiet hours&#8221; and they were messier.  They would also cry &#8220;racism&#8221; if the RAs tried to discipline them in any way or if their neighbors complained about them (for example, complaining because they were playing rap music at 2am with the bass turned all the way up).  I also noticed differences in the academic abilities of my black classmates.  Additionally, I&rsquo;ve noticed that now that I&rsquo;m taking a lot more upper level course, most of the black students have disappeared.  I guess that the biggest change for me is that while I enjoy reading about world history and learning about other cultures and other groups of people, I no longer feel guilty about noticing the differences between groups.</p>

			<p>These guys write from a template, it&rsquo;s got to be.</p>
<p>They say in Family Systems Psychology more or less, &#8220;the sicker the system, the more rigid the roles.&#8221; I have always felt that about Ideologies of the Right or Left. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t belong to either side but rather work (and it takes work) toward a commitment to reality and an acceptance of the consequences of that commitment. In the end, for me, it&rsquo;s worth it - once you get over the shock seeing just how silly we can look when we take ourselves too seriously. One can always take comfort in knowing that those with a commitment to Ideology over Reality, look even sillier. <br>
If you want to see what can happen to you if you are commited to an ideology to the point where it contaminates your view of reality, just read the above article.<br>
The one advantage for anyone interested in studying behavior and values is that his responses are so rigid, making them very repetitive and predictable.<br>
For example, the Moral Outrage over an obvious fact that Mr. Taylor makes in response to Katrina, &#8220;Let us also for the moment consider the banality of bigotry that punctuates Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s reflection on Hurricane Katrina and FEMA&rsquo;s lack of preparation and response.&#8221; (note the attempt to lead the reader, &#8220;Let us&hellip;&#8221;  &#8220;Us&#8221;?)</p>
<p>The devil is in the details and the fact is, the above sentence is typical of a line of dialogue taken from the Universal Script of the First Church of the Not So Holy Inverted World.<br>
In just one sentence the author implies his - Moral Superiority, Intellectual Honesty, Unity (with Reader, arrived at after a careful consideration of the facts and a spiritual awakening to the above mentioned Superiority) and, of course,  Good Against Evil. And with that last one we have their favorite, one that is getting easier to see as day passes day, ie; The Left&rsquo;s need (and the Right&rsquo;s too, by the way) to demonize all dissent and pathologize all opposition. </p>
<p>Not only does this person do more to promote Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s work than any of us here could, he also provides us with plenty of material to begin an independent study on the Pathology of GroupThink. Though, to be sure, he thought he was doing something else.<br>

<p>I agree. Words have meaning. The use of infrequently used words to convey a particular nuance is fine but to just pepper a literary piece with them is poor writing. Its easy to stick unfamiliar words into an article. Whats not so easy is to write beautifully with plain language. Read John Steinbeck for an example of this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It still amuses that that - when flooding occurs in majority-white communities in the Mid-West - there is little crime, few casualties and the residents say &ldquo;we will rebuild&rdquo; through the tears. Yet when flooding occurs in the majority-black community of New Orleans-</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ve all read the eyewitness account provided by American Renaissance.&#8221;</p>

<p>What I saw when the mid west was flooded were people gathering to stack sand bags along the river to stem the tide. What a bunch of fools. The cities were empty!

			<p>&#8220;First, as for the disproportionate rate of violent crime committed by blacks, economic conditions and blatant disparities in income, wealth, and the ease with which particular communities can cultivate assets all help to explain the difference with white crime rates. &hellip; In other words, the unspoken message of Taylor&rsquo;s assertion &mdash; that blacks are dangerous because they are black &mdash; is untenable. Stated clearly, violence is predicated on poverty, not pigmentation.&#8221;<br>
- Christopher</p>
<p>So let me see if I understand this. Christopher claims that blacks do not commit crime in disproportion to their numbers by trying to explain why they commit crime in disproportion to their numbers? You will find that the vast majority of people who are poor have low intelligence. Low intelligence is a contributing factor in criminality. Many of these people are unable to achieve.</p>
<p>So blacks commit crimes because they are unable to achieve and are poor. They are poor because they lack intelligence. The only thing we can do is to give them achievment so that they won&rsquo;t rob and burgle. It almost sounds like extortion.</p>

			<p>A few points. Mr Parrhesia has over-written his blog. He would do well to read Orwell&rsquo;s Politics and The English Language. By his writing style,Mr. Parrhsia is trying to impress his readers that he is a smart guy and morally superior individual. He fails on both points. He sounds snarky and patronizing. In point of fact, he sounds like a complete tool. Next; to anyone who has read the stats on crime from the Bureau of Justice&rsquo; they know that he is misreading the data. If an public available statistical data base, written by professionally trained statisticians isn&rsquo;t good enough, what is? </p>

<p>I too read PAVED, (autographed copy, signed by the master), and the irony of this Christopher&rsquo;s statements is that Jared Taylor kinda sorts comes across as an egalitarian in PAVED.  I think if he told the truth like he does now, there would have been no chance that the book would have been published and distributed in the lamestream channels that it is.  I think this Christopher is analyzing the prose and arguments in PAVED in the context of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s later and current writings, those which are more overtly racial.</p>

			<p>I would like to invite the author of this piece to a nice dose of diversity [reality] in my neighborhood.I live in St.Louis, Missouri. I would then like to take him to our sister city in East St.Louis, Illinois. There I am quite sure he would enjoy a multicultural evening of black on White violence, a small payment for his White skin privilege.If he is very lucky he can experience an evening of love [rape] at the hands of his hosts. I think perhaps his atonement would be complete at that point. This guy is an absolute deluded FOOL. He has no sense of reality and would not last a day in the real world. This guy talks more meaningless nonsense than sports talk radio. Why does our race[I will assume this person is White]produce so many absolute traitors?  Why do so many of our people care more about the other than themselves? To extrapolate this point, I am curious to know if this lost soul cares more about another family than he does his own? I am just glad to know that the cultural distorters who warped this useless,degenerate,blocker of progress,guilt ridden entity, will have no impact upon my five beautiful, White,aware and proud children. They are the future to a once again great culture and people.The progress retarders such as the author of the piece represent the past.We are the future. We are White and Proud. </p>

The book is heavily annotated and, I believe, the logic is not refutable. Taylor is an American Hero. I have and treasure my autographed copy.  The most wonderful thing here is that the book is available in mainstream outlets (or until Barnes &amp; Noble reads this AR post).</p>

			<p>What a goof. He needs to turn off the computer and buy a good dictionary. Then he needs a course in basic writing so somebody can teach him how to write without sounding like a pompous jerk.</p>
<p>I work in Baltimore City. As many of you have already mentioned, I could easily drop him off knee deep in &#8220;da hood&#8221; for an evening of enjoying the beauties of diversity.</p>
<p>Lastly, I too have a copy of &#8220;Paved with Good Intentions.&#8221; Frankly, it made me far more prepared to factually debunk multiculturalism and diversity should anyone ever praise either in my presence. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Stated clearly, violence is predicated on poverty, not pigmentation. (By the way, the same sort of comparisons can be posited with regard to popular standardized tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>  This is a whooper!  I&rsquo;ve lived in Appalachia for a good many years and while it is one of the poorest regions in the country, crime is much less than other &#8220;enriched&#8221; urban, mostly minority areas. The same is true of many places in Maine or northern New England. What do these two regions have in common?  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re mostly white.</p>

			<p>&#8220;According to several studies, when community and personal economic status is comparable between whites and blacks, there are no significant racial crime differences.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I would like to see these &#8220;studies&#8221;&hellip; I do know that up here in the UP of Michigan (which is about 95% white), we have a higher rate of unemployment and make less money than those downstate regions that are majority black. Yet we don&rsquo;t have all the murders, robberies, car-jacking, etc that they are plagued with.</p>
<p>Clearly their is trash in every race, we have plenty of that up here. Still I would rather walk through a trashy white area before a black one   &mdash;   for obvious reasons&hellip;</p>

			<p>So he can&rsquo;t refute Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s claims but calls him a bigot and uses the tiresome &#8220;racism&#8221; label?  I guess my good friend was right when he said liberals are like children. They get too emotional, call people names, and debate respectfully and intelligently.  So this guy is all mad because there is a box that challenges his orthodox views?  Why not let people read Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s literature for themselves instead of letting these self-appointed, elitist, condescending liberals tell people what&rsquo;s best for them.  </p>

<p>Such as:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.with the intention of purchasing a copy of Michael Eric Dyson&rsquo;s Know What I Mean: Reflections on Hip Hop, a text that I plan to employ in one of the courses that I will be teaching this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>A suggestion to you Chris, and other left-wing poseurs like you: you don&rsquo;t need to call it a &#8220;text&#8221;.  I know that fashionable gramscian-marxist european professors have taken to call it that.  But there&rsquo;s already a perfectly good enlgish word for it.  It&rsquo;s a book.  Just call it a book.  b-o-o-k.  Got that?</p>

			<p>The author states:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, the same sort of comparisons can be posited with regard to popular standardized tests. Persons of the same economic class background perform similarly on these tests regardless of color, ethnicity, etc. A study was released by ETS a few years ago suggested that statistically middle-class African American students and statistically middle-class white students performed within a 2% margin of one another on the SAT.&#8221;</p>
<p>All I can say is.. a picture is equal to a thousands words:</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/File_1995-SAT-Income2.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1995-SAT-Income2.png</a></p>
<p>This graph above compares outcomes on SAT tests and cross references race and income. The lowest income group for Whites from $0 to $10,000 outperformed the highest income group for Blacks (70,000 dollars and higher..) and note this was in 1995 dollars. (The SAT administration apparently no longer releases this information.  If the author wants to fall back on the cultural issue, I would him like to explain why Asians in 6 out 8 income categories not only dramatically outperform Blacks in their respective income categories but also somewhat outperform Whites.</p>

			<p>Anonymous&rsquo;s post was amazing and I can relate with a lot of things he states.</p>
<p>Kelly: I can commiserate with you on the burden you feel about Whites sticking up for everyone but themselves.  Believe it or not, I used to have that kind of mindset&hellip;. What triggers it is extreme self-righteousnes that borders on narcissism!  It really has nothing to do with the other groups, but rather the &#8220;Concern you feel for the injustice that they must endure from the MAJORITY.  It really is a self-serving, patting-yourself-on-the-back mentality that has no basis in reality&hellip;..and what&rsquo;s amazing about all of this rooting for all other races but your own is that all the races you stick up for never seem to appreciate it!!!!  It only feeds their SELF-RIGHTEOUS indignation toward Whites!  It&rsquo;s absolutely Insane!  <br>
Before I slipped into this mentality I was pro-White, but brainwashing from Liberalism is powerful!  Reality forced you to wake up to the delusion of White oppression/Minority suffering.  Black behavior and the subsequent dealings in the realm of money forced me away from such dereistic, surreal thinking&hellip;.</p>

			<p>This is freedom&rsquo;s new greatest enemy: the liberal book-burner.  This guy is so indoctrinated, he obviously felt it would be a CRIME to actually read the book before condemning it.  I&rsquo;m surprised he even read the back cover.  The scary part is, you can tell by this guy&rsquo;s attitude that he wants it to be a CRIME for ANYONE to read this book.  The scarier part is, people like these are already in charge of most of the print and electronic media in this country.  We are either on the brink of tyranny or past it, it&rsquo;s hard to tell these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&rsquo;m pretty sure this guy is not religious, so what does he get out of the way he acts? What is his payoff?&#8221;</p>
<p>The adulation of his liberal white-hating peers.</p>

Thanks to Stillwarm for the link to the excellent chart on Wikipedia. I invite Amren readers to keep a wary eye on Wikipedia. As of today, it is not overrun by politically correct editing and censoring. But that could change, as left-wingers try to control every influential source of information they can.</p>
<p>One way to gauge this might be to keep an eye on this specific chart. (There&rsquo;s a chance it will disappear, so save it on your hard disk while you can.)</p>

			<p>To Anonymous who wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of name is Parrhesia? It doesn&rsquo;t sound European and defies placement. Is it Indian (from India) or perhaps Persian?&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s a nom de plume, Parrhesia comes from Greek and means to speak freely or candidly. It implies not only freedom of speech, but the obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.</p>

<p>It is indeed.  That graph is impressive evidence. <br>
The LOWEST income group of whites outperformed the HIGHEST income group of blacks!</p>
<p>It puts to rest the Left&rsquo;s specious argument that it&rsquo;s all a matter of income.  Yet STILL they continue to argue it!</p>

<p>Wow, SAT scores track family icome almost exactly. This is what I&rsquo;ve been saying. People are poor because they lack intelligence and not vice versa. As a percentage of their respective populations, there are more poor (less intelligent) blacks than whites. How can this be disputed anymore.</p>

<p>See Ed Sebesta   &mdash;   someone who has his CV, with all its &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; and anti-Southern credentials and articles and books, on hiis website.  He, like this Christopher, wants the SPLC or ADL to hire him.</p>
