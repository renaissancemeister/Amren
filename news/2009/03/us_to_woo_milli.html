			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronica Uy, Inquirer (Makati City Philippines), March 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MANILA, Philippines  &mdash;  Following the footsteps of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the United States is now stepping up efforts to attract millionaire immigrants who can help stimulate its badly battered economy by investing and creating jobs, INQUIRER.net learned Thursday.</p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security, particularly its Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, issued a set of recommendations to &#8220;stabilize and energize [its] employment creation immigration visa (EB-5) program.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report noted that while the US Immigration Act of 1990 allocates 10,000 fifth employment-based (EB-5) immigrant visas to investors and their family every year, less than 1,000 have been used. Between 1992 and 2004, a total of 6,024 such visas were issues, or an average of 500 a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This underutilization is caused by a confluence of factors, including program instability, the changing economic environment, and more inviting immigrant investor programs offered by other countries,&#8221; said the report issued March 18.</p>
<p>The law created the new category for immigrants who are required to create at least 10 full-time jobs by investing at least $500,000 for commercial enterprises in a rural area or targeted employment area; otherwise, the minimum qualifying investment is $1 million.</p>
<p>Earlier US government assessments of the program predicted that 4,000 millionaire investors and members of their family would sign up, bring in $4 billion in new investments, and create 40,000 jobs every year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recognition of the present turmoil in the US economy, it is incumbent upon USCIS to take all necessary and appropriate steps to facilitate a healthy, vigorous, and smooth-running employment creation immigrant visa program,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Thus, the Ombudsman proposed that the USCIS make it easier for millionaire immigrants enter the US.</p>
<p>Among its specific recommendations were to facilitate earlier deficient applications, standardize adjudications, and assign more people to the EB-5 Administrative Appeals Office.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman also suggested rules that will promote stakeholder and investor confidence, as well as make the adjudicatory processes more predictable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The underutilization of the EB-5 visa category is principally caused by significant regulatory and administrative obstacles, as well as by uncertainties that undermine investor and stakeholder confidence,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>For faster decisions, it also suggested that foreign investors be offered a &#8220;Special Handling Package option .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for a higher fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ombudsman said priority must be given for the review and processing of all EB-5 petitions from the regions, and suggested that the US Departments of State and Commerce promote the EB-5 program overseas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given current economic conditions, by adopting these recommendations USCIS will send a message that it accepts, understands, and will implement Congress&rsquo; intention that the EB-5 program serve as an employment creation engine for our nation,&#8221; the report said.<br>

								<h2>US Stands to Lose High-Skilled Immigrant Entrepreneurs: Study</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Lalit K Jha, Press Trust of India, March 19, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The United States stands to lose high-skilled immigrant entrepreneurs and science and engineering workforce due to protectionist measures it is putting in place in the wake of the economic recession, cautions a latest study.</p>
<p>The survey comes in the context of the large banks, such as Bank of America, and other US companies reducing plans to hire foreign national students due to concerns over political backlash amidst growing US job losses.</p>
<p>The Kauffman Foundation study released yesterday indicates that lessening the number of foreign national students in US jobs may be detrimental to the economic health of the country by accelerating the return of talented immigrant students to their home countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Policymakers are misguided if they believe these talented next-generation entrepreneurs and innovators threaten US jobs. They, in fact, offer the promise of more jobs by building successful, high-growth companies  &mdash;  either in their own businesses or those for which they work,&#8221; said Robert E Litan, vice president of Research and Policy at Kauffman.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by Duke University professor and Harvard researcher Vivek Wadhwa, surveyed 1,224 foreign nationals currently studying in US institutions of higher learning or who had graduated by the end of the 2008 academic school year.<br>

			<p>These millionaire immigrants will be let in on EB 5 visas to create jobs in certain areas.  But will these employees be H-1B visa holders?  If so, a job will literally be created, but you won&rsquo;t get to do it.</p>
<p>The second story is merely a matter of H-1B whores whining about how they need more cheap labor.  There was a similar &#8220;study&#8221; several weeks ago:</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled.  This is just smooth talk from the transnational corporations that profit from third world labor.  Immigrants do not make jobs; they TAKE them.  These corporate predators would have you believe that white people won&rsquo;t work in farms, hospitals, factories, or just about any job that they want cheap labor for.  On top of that, they have tricked many Americans into thinking that they (the average white person) benefits from cheap, third world labor.  Their logic is that they save money from hiring non-whites, and this translates into ultra-cheap products for us.  This isn&rsquo;t so.  Prices on all goods continue to rise as the quality continues to fall.  They are pocketing their profits, as well taking jobs from qualified whites.</p>
<p>So white man, these people are saying that you&rsquo;re too lazy and inferior to do manual labor or practice medicine.  I hope this makes you mad, because anger is something we need a lot more of right now.</p>

The US has been doing this for decades.  Nothing new.<br>
Maybe they&rsquo;ve just stepped it up a bit.</p>
<p>So have many other countries. The bottom line is that if you have the money, you can go practically anywhere.  Would that apply especially to favor certain groups over others? It&rsquo;s no accident. Laws don&rsquo;t get written by themselves.  The law is always designed by those who hold the power to suit those who have the money.</p>

			<p>If foreigners want to invest in the U.S., they can do so without living in the country. Bringing in these &#8220;super entrepreneurs&#8221; damages yet another group of White men: the ones who will have to compete with these imported jewels. </p>
<p>The policy of America&rsquo;s leaders of promoting massive colonization, is not just bad, it is insane. And I use insane in the clinical sense of the word.</p>
<p>The only thing standing between the White race and its destruction is the incompetence of those working to destroy it.</p>

			<p>This was tried in Canada, and was soon being abused.</p>
<p>Indian newspapers were soon reporting that financial institutions would give loans to Indian businessmen to get into Canada, and then recover the loan once citizenship was achieved.</p>
<p>Many rich Chinese moved their families to Canada with no intention of working in Canada.  As soon as the breadwinner could, he would go back to China and continue getting rich off the backs of his countrymen, while Canada provided for his children.</p>

<p>It is for those very reasons I&rsquo;m no longer buying any but the ONLY clothing I need.  No more shopping therapy.  I already have enough NICE stuff.  If it will wear out, like shoes or socks, I want to buy Made in the USA only. I noticed the quality of clothing starting to decline a couple of years ago.  I&rsquo;m lucky; I gained weight but never gave up on losing it, and kept my nice stuff.  That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll eventually be better dressed than most, in classic stuff that won&rsquo;t wear out prematurely.  And, having lost the weight to get back into my nice stuff, I will be healthier.</p>

			<p>America can try to woo all the wealthy immigrants it wants, but with our home-grown version of Robert Mugabe and his Democrat minions pulling the levers in Washington, capital and its holders will not be attracted to this country.  Quite the contrary, it will begin to flee, as will as many established citizens of this nation who will get out with as much as they can.</p>

			<p>Brilliant. Take the most productive citizens from third world countries.</p>
<p>The non-productive citizens will soon follow.</p>

<p>This is true. The Saudis do not allow Iraqi muslims to go to Mecca as a general rule, but RICH Iraqis CAN go. This is how the Saudis control the muslim world.</p>

			<p>How is this &#8221; class &#8221; preference good to the home country of the millionaire ? Let &#8221; freedom &#8221; ring and let the native millionaires take care of their own or the whole population of that country will move to borderless, standardless America; since the genocidal, non-representative, traitorous 1965 Immigration and Reform Act ( of treason ).</p>
