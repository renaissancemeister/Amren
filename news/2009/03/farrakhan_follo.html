<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090301/Nation.of.Islam/">Farrakhan: Followers Must Continue &#8216;Obama Energy&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From a three-hour keynote address by Minister Louis Farrakhan to $10 T-shirts, mentions of President Barack Obama were everywhere at the Nation of Islam&rsquo;s annual convention in a Chicago suburb.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s an energy among our people that has never been seen before, never produced by any man or organization before,&#8221; Farrakhan said of Obama before an estimated 14,000 followers Sunday. &#8220;But we must not allow our people to live in a false world of euphoria. We must accept our responsibility to build our communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam have vigorously supported Obama, even when Obama&rsquo;s campaign tried to distance itself from the 75-year-old Farrakhan. After the minister spoke highly of Obama last year at a convention in Chicago, Obama&rsquo;s campaign released a statement condemning some of Farrakhan&rsquo;s past statements that many have considered offensive.</p>
<p>In a speech days after the election, Farrakhan acknowledged that he then purposely laid low, keeping his praise quiet, so as not to affect Obama&rsquo;s chances at winning the presidency.</p>
<p>It was a move many attending the weekend conference in Rosemont said they understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minister Farrakhan didn&rsquo;t take offense,&#8221; said Audrey Muhammad, who edits &#8220;Virtue Today&#8221; magazine, geared at women in the movement. &#8220;We understand how politics work.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farrakhan told followers to be prepared to make sacrifices as Obama begins work on the faltering economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Debt is another form of slavery and oppression,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s gonna take more than a stimulus package to bring America from where she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some, that included looking to the Obamas as an example.</p>
<p>Broyny Flowers, 32, traveled from Detroit to attend the convention and a standing-room-only session called &#8220;The Michelle Obama Effect.&#8221; Presenters discussed the first lady&rsquo;s approach to marriage, parenting and even how she stocks the shelves at the White House with organic food.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a representative of what virtue is,&#8221; Flowers said. &#8220;She is an anchor for Barack.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The impact they are having on the world is being a happy family, an educated family  &mdash;  the American dream,&#8221; Audrey Muhammad said.<br>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that many Farrakhanites will sacrifice for much of anything beyond their own individual needs.  What makes him think they&rsquo;ll sacrifice for Obama?</p>
<p>I find this bit about debt being slavery amusing coming from an Obama supporter, President Obama is in the process of driving the national debt higher at a faster pace than ever before.  Partly because of the bad economy partly cause by the fallout in the subprime fiasco, which of course was about debt.</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;Michelle Obama Effect?&#8221;  That&rsquo;s when you work at a useless affirmative action sinecure, make $100G doing essentially nothing, and they triple your salary when your husband wins election as U.S. Senator.  All the while your husband becomes President and signs a Lilly Ledbetter law, and proclaims that women shouldn&rsquo;t be discriminated against or be subservient to men (which is right).  However, his wife&rsquo;s income tripled because of what some man was able to do, and only for that reason.</p>
<p>Oh, and that &#8220;job&#8221; of Michelle Obama&rsquo;s?  The UofChi Hospital has eliminated it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Michelle Obama Effect&#8221;?</p>
<p>What would that be,how to succeed when receiving massive amounts of affirmative action and favoritism, inspite of being racist towards whites in the past, maybe even today? True or not, I don&rsquo;t know. But I read that Mrs.Obama practiced law back in the early ninties, and apparently something happened that caused her to be ineligible to ever practice it again  &mdash;  but I digress.  </p>

<p>Ah, the &#8220;Nation of Islam&#8221;:<br>
Despite the fact that a core doctrine of the aforementioned group is that whites are essentially irredeemably evil abominations spawned in a laboratory 6,000 years ago by a mad scientist, the most I&rsquo;ve heard about them in the Media is that they are a &#8220;black nationalist&#8221; group - one wonders if the Catholic Church could get away with declaring blacks the &#8220;cused sons of Ham&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Ok, someone here help me.</p>
<p>I would like to know if anyone can explain to me why Blacks support obama when he is pro-Immigration.</p>
<p>I mean, Whites are still somewhere between 67 to 69% of the population but Blacks aren&rsquo;t (though you would never know that if you walked into any Feberal Building, a joke only readers here would get, since Liberals train themselves not to notice).</p>
<p>We here and at places like VDARE are mostly White people, and we&rsquo;re up in arms about it all, no matter what our political affiliation. But hell, if I was Black I would definitely be worried, and yet&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it just the obvious?  Or is there something I&rsquo;m missing here?</p>

Sacrifices like staying in school, getting a job, not popping out more kids than your income can possibly feed, fathers sticking around to raise their kids&hellip;<br>
Ya&rsquo; know, those REALLY TOUGH sacrifices&hellip;</p>

			<p>A good many of the fat middle class white liberals now wish they could have a do-over on the last election. Regret and doubt now ooze out of their voices when they talk. It is getting harder and harder to defend the grasping power of this enviro-communist with every passing day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him more time.&#8221; &#8220;Give him a year before you rush to judge.&#8221; says Whoopi Goldberg on television.</p>
<p>Does anyone else need A YEAR to accurately summarize Mr. Obama&rsquo;s policies?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel sorry for those who supported Obama and now regret it&hellip;&hellip;BLAME THEM!<br>

<p>I believe that during WWII the German company OPEL paid regular royalties to FORD for every truck produced for the German military, the same was true for Pratt&Whitney; Aircraft engines produced by Japan under license. They were just not so open about it:)</p>

			<p>I thought it was us White folks that had to sacrifice to make up for all the past wrongs that we have committed. I think the vast majority of tax payers are White. We are the ones that are going to have to sacrifice, whether we like it or not. </p>

<p>Obama knows that Wright tainted his carefully crafted image of being the &#8220;post-racial&#8221; candidate in the presidential election with his ridiculous conspiracy theories and implying that Obama was being dishonest when he distanced himself from Wright. If anything, I bet Obama disdains Wright for being a pain in the ass. Obama certainly has severed his ties with Trinity United and wants nothing to do with them now.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
That, my dear Dédalo, is because blacks are frequently irrational!  They don&rsquo;t think far ahead. They live for today and don&rsquo;t consider ramifications and remote consequences. </p>

			<p>Farrakhan and the NATION OF ISLAM or any other fascist people are complete unworthy of our attention. This man is an absolute nut case. I think there are far more important issues than him. He doesnt even care about blacks (like most black leaders) this guy is a racist fool. Does he donate to black schools or to any black issues. He lives in a mostly white neighborhood, that alone shows you what he really thinks about black crime not being so high.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an anti semitic racist fool. His organization is losing steam so he&rsquo;s coming up with some last minute life savers.</p>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s debt spending will enslave the American White and elevate the minorities; that is why all these new programs are being rushed into place.  I think eventual repudiation of monetary commitments [supposed] will spark violence.  Just a plain refusal on the part of whites, even without any organizational representation.</p>

<p>No. Those were hanafi muslims:</p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t Farakhan in that group? I do seem to remember he was. I was brought out of Viet-Nam along with quite a lot of SF and Ranger types and deployed in DC during the black riots there which I think had something to do with MLK being killed.</p>
