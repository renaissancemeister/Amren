			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Henry, Telegraph (London), March 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrant pupils are overtaking many white children at school because their families place more value on education, a key Government adviser has said.</p>
<p>Rapid progress was being made by children from Chinese, Bengali and Indian backgrounds, while white working-class boys, in particular, were struggling, according to Sir Mike Tomlinson, the former head of Ofsted.</p>
<p>In controversial comments which will raise questions about the focus of Government funding, Sir Mike said that white working-class parents failed to place the same value on education as their ethnic minority counterparts.</p>
<p>As a result, poor white children have low expectations of what they can achieve, leading to lack of effort and low results.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing every ethnic group progress rapidly  &mdash;  Chinese, Bengali, Indian,&#8221; said Sir Mike. &#8220;The results that are being achieved are higher and this has improved the numbers applying to university and entering professions such as medicine, veterinary science, law and accountancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A very high value is placed on education among many ethnic groups, compared with white working-class families. There seems to be different value systems at work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Mike, now chief adviser on London schools, said that if parents could not support their children, schools had to raise their expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raising aspiration is essential,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is difficult to tap in to parents and difficult to get to them as a group.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got to try and get them involved but sometimes it is a losing battle. Which is why the school has to raise aspirations, if it is not coming from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Government has poured millions of pounds in to tackling boys&rsquo; underachievement, yet only 15 per cent of 16-year-old white boys who qualify for free school meals  &mdash;  an indicator of deprivation  &mdash;  leave schools with five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including maths and English.</p>
<p>The figure for black boys from similar backgrounds is 22 per cent and for children from Asian backgrounds, 29 per cent  &mdash;  still low but improving.</p>
<p>Some critics have argued that funding ringfenced for ethnic minority pupils should be redirected.</p>
<p>In a report last year, researchers from Manchester University identified a cycle of underachievement in white working-class families which was endemic in some areas.</p>
<p>The report, which focused on how some schools were bucking the trend, said that teachers had to abandon the mindset that poor white children were doomed to failure because of their background.</p>
<p>Head teachers who made a difference had high expectations and often came from poor backgrounds themselves.<br>

		<p>The left wanted non-white immigrants to populate England, in the mistaken belief that it would end class and race distinctions.  Instead, class is being reinforced.</p>
<p>An educated Chinese or Pakistani wants to be part of a multi-racial upper class.  They do not want their children rubbing shoulders with the white commoners, and certainly don&rsquo;t want their children being socialist. </p>

		<p>&#8220;because their families place more value on education&#8221; I`m not saying for a moment this is true. Sounds like  some kind of a springboard for further concessions. But if it IS true&hellip; could it be because the school values the immigrants more than the nativive born?!? <br>
 In grade school I was a serious glass breaking, classroom trashing vandal. Couldn`t tell you why exactly after forty years. But it made me sit up and take notice of a news item a while back. Seems there is a spike in such acts among White pre-teens. I read further. It interviewed one of the boys who gave a hell of a jaw dropper. He said, &#8220;I didn`t do it because I hate school. I did it because school hates me!!&#8221;  I rest my case&hellip; <br>

Wow, I&rsquo;m genuinely suprised by that. &#8216;Similar backgrounds&rsquo; suggest data manipulation to make black scores seem higher, but if black males are outperforming white males in this area, it&rsquo;s chronic. Black girls are understandable because during adolescence girls naturally show more self-discipline than boys. Black boys though &hellip; this is disastrous and I&rsquo;m at loss to explain these results without recourse to further data. As I&rsquo;ve said, it may be the case that researchers have been selective in their notion of &#8216;similar background&rsquo; in order to boost the black average. Otherwise, this is phenomenal &hellip; and dosen&rsquo;t bode well for the future of our people!</p>

Britain has always had an intractable white underclass.</p>
<p>That resources are going to educate non-whites in Britain at the expense of whites is no surprise but no less tragic.</p>

<p><p>The Asian students&rsquo; families are reaping where they did not sow.  <p>My bet is that a lot of these white youngsters are unmotivated, and feel dispossessed in their own country.  That could explain why many are reportedly falling behind.</p></p></p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t the White children&rsquo;s country anylonger so why would they bother learning and achieving? To what end? Being displaced from their own country? This will soon happen to the White children in America also. Shame on all of us adults who did nothing to stop the genocide and displacement of our own kind.</p>

		<p>You are all wrong!</p>
<p>The immigrants&rsquo; parents show more interest in their children, spend time with them, and that&rsquo;s why they excel.</p>
<p>This has been noted before in Chinese and Jewish families.</p>
<p>You spend time with,  and notice, that which you love  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>A strong family structure, with your parents pushing you and believing in you  &mdash;  solid rock! </p>

		<p>These children&rsquo;s parents need to get political and vocal.  Call the schools on their programs.  Never surrender. White pride world wide.  Just have the courage to speak up. The safest thing to do is point out unfairness and preferential policies and don&rsquo;t back down.  If necessary just keep repeating yourself and refuse to go away.</p>
<p>I substitute teach in Kansas and I believe we are seeing the beginnings of this sentiment here with the younger boys not willing to take the new hen pecking order.  I say good for them. </p>

		<p>I find this a little hard to believe: I&rsquo;ve been to britain and i&rsquo;ve read about its minority progress report. The Non-Muslim Indians (Sikhs, Hindus, Jains, Parsis, etc.) are doing very well academically/economically, and so are the Chinese/East Asians.  By contrast the Blacks (mostly of Caribbean-Jamaican, etc.-and African origin) and the Muslims (who are overwhelmingly Pakistani and Bangladeshi) are doing very poorly and are (surprise! surprise!) at the bottom of british society academically and economically. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no demographer, but I will bet that some of the figures we see here are skewed are misreported.  &lsquo;The figure for black boys from similar backgrounds is 22 per cent&rsquo;-frankly, I don&rsquo;t believe that: I&rsquo;m sure that data manipulation took place here-i&rsquo;m sure of it!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s more to do with the demographics of education. Asians have an utter contempt for black africans, and try not mix with them. Where people live dictates which school the children attend as the UK does not have a US style &#8216;bussing&rsquo; policy. This leads to a mainly asian &amp; white or black &amp; white education split. Study the attitude of failing white boys in a black &amp; white mixed housing/schooling area and it is very apparant that they rapidly adopt the lazy, criminal, rapping, drug/knife gang culture of blacks including street language and &#8216;hoodie&rsquo; clothing. Asians for the most part avoid this but their children attend schools along with white pupils, and I&rsquo;m certain that their study and work ethos rubs off onto the whites, not in every case of course, but it&rsquo;s a noticeable trend. A very disturbing film covering this very subject is &#8216;Kidulthood&rsquo;, and although I recommend serious viewing, it&rsquo;s certainly not entertainment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Or is the Republican base, contrary to what this article implies, just as deluded as the leadership? I suspect the latter. Otherwise, matters wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this bad in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly an apples to apples comparison. The poor whites tend to come from genetically inferior stock (the parents are poor for a reason), where as the Asian immigrants tend to represent the cream of Asian societies wanting something better.</p>

		<p>A few factors to take into account.</p>
<p>Academic performance doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect economic performance. Working class British whites often tend to do better in the workforce than they do at school, and there unemployment rate isn&rsquo;t particularly high.</p>
<p>The academic performance of immigrants varies a lot, depending on race and class, West Indian Blacks do poorly, Muslim Asians don&rsquo;t tend to do very well, while indian immigrants and some African Blacks do very well.</p>
<p>Poor, working class whites also lack civic leaders, role models and spokespeople, since many of the smarter working class immigrant have moved to other countries.</p>

		<p>Anonymous at 10:36AM pegs it well, but not completely.</p>
<p>I spent my teens in a Jewish neighborhood (I am Jewish myself). In Jr Hi and High School, most (but not all) of the Jewish kids had their faces buried in textbooks or were staying after school for activities like the ham radio club, the debating society, or other such pursuits. It was not something done BECAUSE they were Jewish, it was what their priorities were; their values.  They saw more value in such activities than, say, throwing a ball.</p>
<p>To say that the White kids see no hope and so don&rsquo;t try, is a copout.  That&rsquo;s the same sniveling &#8220;gimme gimme!&#8221; copout that blacks use, and is every bit as inexcusable and disgusting.</p>
