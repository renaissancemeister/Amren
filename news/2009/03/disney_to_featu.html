<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Move over Snow White. Make room for Disney&rsquo;s first black princess.</p>
<p>With America&rsquo;s first African-American president in the White House, Disney is counting on an African-American princess to be a big hit in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But even though The Princess and the Frog isn&rsquo;t released until later this year, it is already stirring up controversy.</p>
<p>For while Princess Tiana and many in the cartoon cast are black  &mdash;  the prince is not.</p>
<p>Which has led some critics to complain that Disney has ducked the opportunity for a fairytale ending for a black prince and princess.</p>
<p>Disney&rsquo;s first black princess, Princess Tiana  &mdash;  and her prince, Prince Naveen. Some viewers have slammed Disney for giving its first black princess a prince who appears to be white</p>
<p>While some have hailed Disney&rsquo;s decision as a reflection of melting pot America, others say the company is sending out a mixed message.</p>
<p>Although the black princess&rsquo;s love interest in the new animated musical is called Prince Naveen of Maldonia and is voiced by a Brazilian actor, he looks more white than black in photographs from the film that Disney have released.</p>
<p>Since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, all of Disney&rsquo;s princesses have predominantly been white.</p>
<p>A native Indian princess was featured in Pocahontas and Jasmine in Aladdin had a Middle Eastern appearance.</p>
<p>The race row hasn&rsquo;t yet hit the mainstream because the film&rsquo;s release date isn&rsquo;t until late in the year, but Internet chat rooms and blogs have been abuzz with complaints.</p>
<p>One disappointed fan wrote (sic): &#8216;I think it&rsquo;s sad that he is white because its saying that black love isn&rsquo;t good enough and that black men could never be princes.</p>
<p>&#8216;Disney had the perfect chance to make its first black prince, but instead it decided to go the controversial route.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another complained (sic): &#8216;I am very disappointed and I wished Disney had made the prince black,(and the ironic thing is the prince in the movie  is white but  the evil voodoo villain is voiced by a black actor and is  black).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since announcing their plans for the first black princess in 2006 the production of Hollywood studio&rsquo;s 49th animated film has been dogged by racial controversy.</p>
<p>Originally called The Frog Princess, its heroine was to be a chambermaid called Maddy working for a spoilt white debutante in 1920s New Orleans.</p>
<p>But the storyline sparked a backlash from critics who claimed it reinforced prejudice and demeaned black people.</p>
<p>The princess&rsquo;s original name was perceived by some to be a stereotypical &#8216;slave name&rsquo; and she was also a maid working for a wealthy white boss, which was criticised as being racially insensitive.</p>
<p>Even the New Orleans setting for the film was questioned as it had overtones of voodoo and slavery.</p>
<p>Disney has insisted its choice of a black princess was part of a policy to give characters as much diversity as possible.</p>
<p>In the past, founder Walt Disney has been accused of being racist, particularly against Jews and blacks.</p>
<p>One extreme example often cited by his critics was in The Jungle Book which was made in 1964 at the height of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>In one scene, Mowgli is told he can&rsquo;t live with Baloo the bear because different species need to keep to themselves.</p>
<p>Disney also ran into trouble when creating the character of Pocahontas in 1995 for the retelling of the encounter between an English settler and a Native American princess.</p>
<p>Animators were accused of modelling Pocahontas on model Naomi Campbell, although they said they had used Native American faces as their inspiration.</p>
<p>Anika Noni Rose, the black actress who voices the character of Princess Tiana, has insisted that people should look beyond the colour of the character.</p>
<p>&#8216;Not only is she the first black princess, she&rsquo;s the first American princess. We&rsquo;ve never had an American princess,&rsquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&#8216;The scope and the significance is larger than people even realise,&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>Rose has starred in Dreamgirls but is best known in Britain as the officious secretary Grace in the new BBC series The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency.</p>
<p>The film also features the voice of chat show queen Oprah Winfrey as Tiana&rsquo;s mother called Eudora. The film is scheduled for release in December.</p>
<p>Although set in 1920s New Orleans it an adaptation of the classic tale The Frog Prince.</p>
<p>In the Disney version,  Prince Naveen is turned into a frog by a voodoo magician and asks Princess Tiana to kiss him to break the spell.</p>
<p>But she turns into a frog and the pair must reverse the spell, while in true fairy tale tradition, they fall in love.</p>
<p>Nobody from Disney was available to comment tonight.</p>

			<p>It could be worse.  It could be a black prince and a white princess.  A popular Galveston, Texas theme park is doing a Snow White stage show for little children and the prince is a Mexican Mestizo and snow white is white.  Remember the names of the people responsible for this debasement of the white race and deal with them when the day of reckoning dawns&hellip;     </p>

			<p>Prince Naveen does look Brazilian, mostly white with some black, save the hair.</p>
<p>Disney&rsquo;s purpose here isn&rsquo;t black, it&rsquo;s miscegenation.  If it had both a black prince and princess, there would be all of 100 people who would pay to see it.  As it is, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll do that well at the Box Office.</p>

			<p>Interracial relationships are about &#8216;improving the race&rsquo; (mejorando la raza) for the person gaining whiter genes into their bloodline. This touchy subject probably didn&rsquo;t cross the minds of Disney exec&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It is also about patriarchal cultures conqering another&rsquo;s females (middle Easterners and Africans treat it this way in their laws and customs).  Hence, some people have a visceral reaction to seeing it in public entertainment.</p>
<p>White males and females are the trophy mates for non-whites, while at the same time are resented for being part of a small, exclusive club. </p>
<p>Disney is not equal to the task of addressing the issues they are stirring up. </p>

			<p>Black princesses do not, and have never existed. The feudal world is part of European history. Disney used to be a White institution, in a White country, creating stories derived from White heritage and culture.  I&rsquo;ll bet the Princess Tiana dolls end up being one of the worst selling toys ever inspired by Disney.</p>
<p>If Disney would like to engage in true multiculturalism they could do a cartoon about a young African girl who has her genitals mutilated, is raped repeatedly, is abandoned to raise multiple children without fathers, and finally dies of starvation because her civilization can&rsquo;t figure out how to produce enough food even though they live in an area teaming with plants and animals.</p>

			<p>I am no genius, but I predicted this years ago. First, Disney had White hero, white heroine, in Snow White, etc. Then had ethnic male/female leads in Alladin. Then White male/ethnic female in Pocahontas. This is another Pocahontas situation except with a Black rather than an Indian. The next Disney step is, of course, for a Black Prince with a White Princess. Then, probably a couple of Queens ( a couple of gay princes!)This is all a part of a Disney that has been hijacked by various interest groups trying to reach into our homes and mold the minds of our children.</p>

			<p>I have no problem with a black princess. You have to make money somehow and if Disney wants to marked to black little girls then let them have at it. I do have a problem with them selling miscegenation to kids too young to date. If kids see enough of this then they will start to internalize it, especially if they do not have any parental feedback as to why this is wrong. </p>

			<p>If you look carefully, the prince, Naveen looks Hispanic or maybe 7/8&rsquo;s (or 3/4&rsquo;s) White and rest Black. With logic, one should reason that the prince is not pure White!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Blacks do have a right to complain, as this film apparently promotes race-mixing (with a Black princess). </p>

			<p>I will be honest with you, Prince Naveen does not look white to me.  Prince Naveen looks like a man from India with a relatively lighter skin.  &#8220;Naveen&#8221; does not sound like a typical Anglo-saxon man&rsquo;s name either.  It mostly sounds like a typical man&rsquo;s name in India.  </p>
<p>A typical Anglo-saxon person&rsquo;s skin is pinkish, but there is no hint of pink in the man&rsquo;s skin.  </p>

			<p>Just who are they marketing this to anyhow?  Blacks aren&rsquo;t going to see this because of the White Prince and any White children going to see this will be girls.  I wouldn&rsquo;t take my son to see this even if the cast was White because it&rsquo;s strictly an animated chick flick.  Are they trying to get the White girls to wish they were black so they can land a White man?  LOL.</p>

I hope blacks are outraged by this. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no big deal and even considered great progress by blacks when white culture is subverted by blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks thrive only by their double standards. I hope they give us lots of arguments and reasons as to why it&rsquo;s wrong for the prince to be white.</p>

			<p>It should be obvious why Disney made the prince White: they are promoting miscegenation.  For years advertisers have used ads (black male, white female) to subtly promote it.  TV honchos on the other hand, have been less subtle.</p>
<p><a href="https://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/behind-the-badge.2/?pkw=PI&amp;vendor=Paid%20Inclusion&amp;OCID=iSEMPI" rel="nofollow">https://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/behind-the-badge.2/?pkw=PI&vendor;=Paid%20Inclusion&OCID;=iSEMPI</a></p>
<p>Since Kevin Costner&rsquo;s interracial movie &#8220;The Bodybuard,&#8221; I guess the powers-that-be have decided it&rsquo;s time to start promoting white boy/black girl romances.  That Disney would be involved in this is disgusting.  The old man must be spinning in his grave.</p>

			<p> This Disney animation is just another social engineering attempt. But this time its aimed at modern white males to convince them its &#8220;normal and natural&#8221; to select a bi-racial mate.  Medieval European royal mate selection was all about lineage, bloodlines and similar physical characteristics. Disneys portrayal of  multicultural characters is nothing but propaganda.<br>
 Even if this wasn&rsquo;t a fairy-tail the very idea that a European royal would select a mate of another race during that era would make it one.</p>

			<p>Naveen is a distinctly east indian name. From the given photo, both of the characters look very european (focus on the costumes). The &#8220;hero&#8221; looks vaguely caucasian. It&rsquo;s tough to deduce exactly which breed he belongs to.</p>
<p>Asian women - caucasian man has become a cultural paradigm of its own. More and more black women find that the men in their families aren&rsquo;t very palatable socially. They are seeking stable family lives and non-bastard children. I wonder if this movie wants other races to feel differently about black women instead?</p>

			<p>For years Hollywood has been showing images of white women falling in love with black men and nobody seemed to care.  You would think that all of the multicults would be ecstatic over a mixed race relationship.  To me, this just shows that the &#8220;diversity&#8221; movement is not about promoting racial equality or harmony; it is about humiliating white men.  <br>
By the way, the reason the prince is white is because Disney is hoping a handsome white prince will bring in young white girls and help the movie break the color barrier.  If this movie is seen as a &#8220;black&#8221; film it will tank at the box office.</p>

			<p>Anyone (is there really any sane person who is?) Shocked by this visual should take a trip to a local toy store that rhymes with boys r us. In particular to the &#8216;High School Musical&rsquo; section with Barbie style dolls. Here you will find two of the movie stars- a white girl and a black boy-  dressed in their prom clothes, coupled as a set of 2  dolls boxed together. Last time I checked Disney was the same media maniacal organization behind that movie as well. Any surprise Disney has turned to supporting &#8220;diversity&#8221;? Disney knows when they smell money!</p>

			<p>Not a lot makes sense here. Why are they mad about there being no black princess when most fairy tales take place in bygone days in Europe? The fact that they are surprised that there hasn&rsquo;t been an American princess is also seems odd,  titles of nobility have never exactly um well existed in this country.</p>
<p>Also If I am not mistaken Disney already remade Cinderella with rapper Brandy as Cinderella but whatever.<br>

<p>Now, THERE&rsquo;S an oxymoron if I ever heard one. (You can also leave the &#8216;oxy&rsquo; off the word if you&rsquo;d like)!</p>
<p>&hellip;and why oh why, do biracial people always aspire down, rather than up? (Rhetorical question - the answer is obvious these days). Remember when blacks used to do everything they could to &#8216;pass&rsquo; (as being white   &mdash;   the brown paper bag test).</p>

			<p>The silliest race-mixing movie I remember recently was the 1999 remake of &#8220;Annie&#8221; with Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks (supposedly the richest man in the world) falling for his black secretary.  That was a Disney flick too.</p>

			<p>I speak for frogs everwhere. We are totally hopping mad about these toady type humans spawning utter lies about our unique heritage just because we go skinny-dipping! No American queens eh? Well, one lived in a palace in an American state until her death a few years ago. Hawaii anyone? As for kissing.. well, just look at that awful tiana. Wouldn&rsquo;t catch me snogging her, I&rsquo;d rather croak.</p>

			<p>Did anyone notice how well the Pirates of the Caribbean movies did compared to the Haunted Mansion movie?  It doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to figure out why.  I actually boycotted the Haunted Mansion movie when it came out (despite it being my favorite ride at Disney) because I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to relate to the characters, and apparently a lot of other people felt the same way.</p>

			<p>  The movie is yet another chapter in the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. Our privileged elites will push this agenda whenever possible. It seems like white men have been resisting the trend, so we have The Princess and the Frog. Social engineering seems to be the goal of much of this so-called entertainment</p>

			<p>As this flick will fall flat on its face, just like all the other race-mixing garbage Hollywood has put out, I say let them go right ahead and spend TONS of money on the creation and publication of this stupid film. Only the &#8216;Head in the Clouds&rsquo; Liberals will allow their kids to be brainwashed by this bilge. The great majority of the rest of us will NOT support this film in any way. As long as Hollywood can rack up a LOSS this is fine with me.</p>

			<p>As a black woman who dates interracialy(mostly Latino, white,asian) I&rsquo;m excited to see black women finally getting some positive attention from the media. Its nice to see us being portrayed as nice lovable feminine viable mates for  men of different ethnic groups. There are so many negative stereotypes about us having bad attitudes, angry, many different baby daddies,and low class hoochies, that scare men off before actually getting to know us.  So this and other movies like this are very helpful for us.  Black women have to date interracialy if want to have legitimate children and a nuclear family unit. Black men demand babies without marriage and many of them won&rsquo;t share in the responsibility. The few decent and respectable black men who are viable partners are with women of other ethnicities which leaves us to pursue others or become a poor single mother on welfare .</p>

<p>The villain in this movie is a black male. It sends a subliminal message to black females: The white man will come and save you from the evil black man who is unreliable, irresponsible, and untrustworthy. You should chose us.</p>

			<p>Because of a technique called &#8216;underdrawing,&rsquo; in which levels of detail are left out, the simpler lines of Japanese animation often create characters that seem accessably Western European looking even though Japanese viewers consider the same characters as &#8216;native&rsquo; Japanese. </p>
<p>You will never again see a character like *this* created by Disney or any other American animation studio:<br>

<p>Japanese anime also often includes racially homogenous classroom settings with the &#8216;odd looking character&rsquo; usually employed as a pratfall.<br>

   Even though I personally don&rsquo;t approve of interracial dating, I thank you for your honesty and candor. I definitely know where you are coming from. I&rsquo;ve known many intelligent, well mannered and cultured black Southern women who have been unable to find an acceptable/worthwhile black male. You have my sympathy for what it&rsquo;s worth. </p>

			<p>The liberals have launches a massive campaign to persuade whites to have children with blacks.  They want to breed the white race into a minority and then breed them out of existence.  People who don&rsquo;t want to believe this say &#8216;it&rsquo;s reflecting social realities&#8221;.  This is nonsense.  For example black male white female couples on tv and the movies far exceed reality. They are creating a new social reality through their genocidal propaganda.  They always show a hip black male and a dorky white male together to make the black seem superior.  Pay close attention to the background of commercials.  They constantly show black males and white females with big smiles on their faces.  </p>

			<p>On a mostly unrelated note, I thought I&rsquo;d add that if you are struggling to find a movie which is somewhat palatable with regards to its political overtones, the recent action movie &#8220;Taken&#8221; was a pleasant surprise.  It is a simple tale of a white father, Liam Nesson, cutting a swath of destruction through a gang of Muslim women traffickers who kidnap his daughter. The movie isn&rsquo;t all that complex, (although it isn&rsquo;t overtly political, although Neeson&rsquo;s character says a few naughty things about immigrants), it is a refreshing change from the normal hollywood propaganda. <br>
 <br>
Perhaps unsurprisingly it also did extraordinarily well at the box office exceeding predictions.</p>

<p>Although i did see the movie &#8220;Taken&#8221; and enjoyed it, i beg to differ on your spin of it. I thought it was a propaganda piece, to trick and brainwash the young adult white male (viewer,) into thinking that the young and vulnerable white women in this country are still a &#8220;protected species&#8221;-which a lot of us know is not true.   </p>

			<p>I, too, saw the black-white High School Musical 3 prom doll couple at Target. There were quite a few of them left. Didn&rsquo;t seem to be much in demand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is Disney or not, but a few years back somebody made a muppet version of Wizard of Oz and, of course, Dorothy was black. When I saw the ads, I thought it was the dumbest business decision I had ever seen. Muppet movies are usually very well done but I would bet a black Dorothy turned off about 80% of people who otherwise would have gone to see it. </p>
<p>Decisions like this prove that making money is the primary motive. The agenda is the primary motive and all of the failed shows littering the bargain rack at the video store proove that. The next stratospheric entertainment hit a la Seinfeld is just waiting for the next producer with the guts to create a show with no blacks or other forced diversity characters in it. Who will be brave enough to reap the reward? </p>

<p>I am Korean, and be assured that the interracial dating is still rare in this world.  About 95% of all black men in North America are married to black women, and about 95% of black NBA athletes are married For some reason the mainstream media always gives all the attention it can give to black athletes with non-black wives.   </p>
<p>I am an Asian male and the Asian boys rarely receive any help from the mainstream media either.  Whenever an Asian man appears on a movie, he is mostly the boss of the bad guys or a guy who jumps around and performs martial art moves.  </p>
<p>Why not go hang out near Howard University or something, you are guaranteed to find viable men there.  </p>
<p>I also read here on AmRen in the past that Latino men are the group of non-black men who find black women attractive most.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Ah, I wonder if any AmRen member watched World Baseball Classic final?  Even if team Japan did beat team Korea in extra innings, the game was enormously enjoyable and I am very proud of team Korea for the persistence and effort.  It was an epic movie.  </p>
<p>I thought it was also hilarious when people talked on the internet about the Korean players that &#8220;but I believe HS Kim and TK Kim both are out of the game?&#8221; or &#8220;DS Lee and RJ Lee make great double play mates!&#8221; I am sorry if Korean names are too confusing and difficult to remember.  </p>
<p>In Korea, it is very rare for people to have the same first names, and there are only about 15 last names in total.  Of course, Lee, Kim, Choi, Park are the most common ones, and my last name is wayyyyy down there.  Mine is one of the rare ones. </p>

			<p>My kids have a DVD called Air Buddies. It&rsquo;s basically a live action film with dogs that used computer effects to make the dogs look like they are talking. The main human character is a white boy around the age of nine. What&rsquo;s odd is that the white boy is followed around for the entire film by a black boy of about the same age. The black boy has maybe three lines in the whole movie. There is absolutely no reason for him to even be in the movie at all as far as character development or plotline. It just seems like they stuck some black kid in the movie because there has to be a black kid even if he doesn&rsquo;t say or do anything. If you have kids rent it sometime. It really is bizarre. That might be Disney, too, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>That is a horrible situation for you. Many white men keep acting like adolescents well into their 20&rsquo;s if not early 30&rsquo;s and then want to marry much younger or ethnic women. The feminist movement empowered men much to the detriment of women of all colors. </p>

<p>That is so true!  However, the Japanese can be forgiven for doing this because they use it as a marketing ploy.  There is nothing &#8220;sinister&#8221; about doing that.  </p>
<p>Years ago Japanese animators realized there was a market for their products in the West so they blurred the racial lines of their characters to give them greater appeal to Western audiences.  A classic example: are the characters in this drawing White or Japanese/Chinese?</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for &#8220;Western&#8221; animators.  Here, animation, like other forms of the mass media, are used to further the agenda of the one-worlders bent on destroying the White race through miscegenation.</p>

			<p>Even the Disney animation movie &#8220;Beauty and The Beast&#8221; was a movie    done to promote race mixing. It told white girls go ahead and have romantic relationships with creatures completely alien to you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what their background is or what society will think, just go with your &#8220;feelings&#8221;. Boycott all things Disney.</p>

			<p>If Disney really wanted to be politically correct, then wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to choose an actual African leader to model the movie&rsquo;s lead character on instead of using someone like Tiana (who basically looks like a black high school student who just dressed up to go to the Renaissance Fair)?  If Disney wanted to tell a story about a prestigious African character, then <i>The Animated Adventures of Robert Mugabe</i> (complete with singing animal sidekicks) would have been a lot more entertaining than another boring princess-meets-her-prince story.  </p>

			<p>Disney has always had a truth problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swiss Family Robinson&#8221; portrayed shipwrecked survivors making all sorts of wooden appliances and labor-saving devices, all without getting their clothes dirty or their hair mussed.</p>
<p>Disney has often portrayed unpredictable wild animals as having human characteristics, which we all know is only ture up to a point. Beyond that point danger lies.</p>
<p>So if, in modern days, they portray non-White people as though they were White-in-spirit, with appealing White characteristics, I can get past that.</p>
<p>As far as this mostly-White prince falling in love with a black princess  &mdash;  she will be portrayed as White-in-spirit, with Aryan values and mannerisms, I have no doubt. They might throw in a few Black expressions, maybe, but that will be just an aside.</p>
<p>Then, if some total White nincompoop tries to hook up with a Black girl, thinking she is like Tiana  &mdash;  no problem.</p>
<p>Reality will wake them up double-quick.    </p>

			<p>He doesn&rsquo;t look white to me, looks a little more hispanic. Why does the news always try to stir racial storms in favor of black people. </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even heard about this film, and I live in America. Yet someone in the UK knows about it already and is already trying to stir racial hate against white people. British media should watch what they say as they cause great damage and hate against white people back in the US.</p>
<p>Any how it would be best for the prince to be black. However the prince doesn&rsquo;t really look white at all. However black Americans brought this upon them selves they wanted to mixs 40 years ago. Wether they like it or not their off spring will continue to mixs they opened up the flood gates. Now let them reap what they made. Whites need to demand that the media never place a white man or woman with a non-white in any of their films. This way us whites won&rsquo;t complain and blacks, hispanics won&rsquo;t complain.</p>
