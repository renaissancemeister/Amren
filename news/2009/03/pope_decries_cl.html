<h1>Pope Decries &#8216;Clouds of Evil&rsquo; Over Africa at Mass</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &mdash;  Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass Sunday with an estimated one million Angolans and decried the &#8220;clouds of evil&#8221; over Africa that have spawned war, tribalism and ethnic rivalry that reduce poor people to slavery.</p>
<p>The biggest crowd of Benedict&rsquo;s seven day pilgrimage to Africa turned up in sweltering heat for the open-air service on the outskirts of Angola&rsquo;s seaside capital, Luanda, the last major event before the end of the visit on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;How true it is that war can destroy everything of value&#8221;, Benedict said mopping his sweaty brow with a white handkerchief.</p>
<p>Evils in Africa have &#8220;reduced the poor to slavery and deprived future generations of the resources needed to create a more solid and just society,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Benedict told the crowds clustered in a huge vacant lot near a cement factory that he regretted the deaths of two women who were trampled in a stampede at a stadium Saturday before his address to young Angolans.</p>

			<p>Sorry, B-16.  I don&rsquo;t think an ethereal &#8220;cloud&#8221; is over Africa making Africans do these things.  It&rsquo;s just the nature of Africans.</p>
<p>Of course, no religious group will admit racial differences.  Not Catholics, Lutherans, High Protestants, other Protestants, much less anyone, because they see a growing black African population in Africa and elsewhere, and they&rsquo;re not going to be able to get them to come to their churches by telling them that they&rsquo;re less worthy than white people.  It&rsquo;s the same with Hispanics   &mdash;   American Catholic Leadership is pro-amnesty for the most part, but the Protestants also have designs of converting that growing population to one form or another of Protestantism.</p>

			<p>The Churches have been sell-outs for the last century or so. If anything they are anti-White. The very people that formed Christianity. Many Whites have awoken up to this fact and quit going to church altogether. I have. I do my own Bible study. That way I know I am getting the truths. The Churches sure aren&rsquo;t telling it. </p>

&#8220;Evils in Africa have &ldquo;reduced the poor to slavery and deprived future generations of the resources needed to create a more solid and just society,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Although I appreciate that this is more sensible and realistic than many papal pronouncements, this one doesn&rsquo;t quite get it right. </p>
<p>Evils in Africa have reduced the poor to slavery? No   &mdash;   if the white man had never shown up, poverty and slavery would be ALL that Africa ever had! It&rsquo;s only since Europeans started (IMO unwisely) messing with the place that ANY level of non-poverty and non-slavery has been known. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only since Europeans have been DRIVEN OUT by Africans that the poverty the misery has returned. </p>
<p>The same not-quite-right thinking mars this statement, too: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;deprived future generations of the resources needed to create a more solid and just society,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><br>
Again: the resources have been all over Africa, sitting there for the taking and the exploiting, since time began. It&rsquo;s only Caucasian colonists who&rsquo;ve ever had any idea of what to DO with those resources. Natives in Southern Africa were clueless about all those shiny things under their feet, and had to be told by Bwana that these little stones were called &#8220;diamonds&#8221; and that other Bwanas across the big water in Bwanaland would trade many cows for them. </p>
<p>So what the Pontiff is lamenting is, as Question Diversity has noted, simply a case of &#8220;Africans being African.&#8221; </p>
<p>Maybe the Pope has a vested interest in helping Africa stop being so African, but I don&rsquo;t. Personally, I&rsquo;d much rather we just evacuated every remaining white and then cut the whole continent loose. Then they can go back to the bush, or get enslaved by the Chinese Empire, I don&rsquo;t really care. Just as long as neither I nor my tax dollars ever have to have anything to do with Africa ever again. </p>

<p>All of this religious stuff will be moot if/when the muslims get control of the U.S.</p>

			<p>Yes, lets blame some intangible, theological &#8220;clouds&#8221; on African war, tribalism and ethnic rivalry that reduce poor people to slavery. We keep coming up with excuse after excuse after excuse for the horrors of Africa while we completely disregard the source of that horror: AFRICANS!</p>
<p>(Crybaby mode:ON) GOD HELP US ALL! </p>

			<p>But does he really get it?  - and did his audience get it?  I doubt it. Talking in vague generalities about a &#8220;cloud of evil&#8221; means nothing. Evil is not a cloud - it is evil people.  And who are those evil people?  Why, it&rsquo;s the evil white colonialists, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s most likely what those million good Catholics took home from the sermon.  All their problems are not their fault.  It&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s fault, and the white men&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>Far from blaming Whitey, the Pope last week blamed Africans themselves for prostitution, human-trafficking and the spreading of AIDS through their reckless sexual practices.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm</a></p>
<p>Some atheists on the internet mocked the holy father for saying that Africans should embrace abstinence and marital fidelity. So maybe the Pope is unrealistic about racial differences but he&rsquo;s not a self-hating white like Tim Wise or Morris Dees. </p>

			<p>Was it a &#8216;wisp&rsquo;, or a &#8216;mist&rsquo;, or a &#8216;fog&rsquo;, or a &#8216;small cloud&rsquo; (of evil) that made those two women get trampled, I wonder? The Pontiff should have told us, while he was expressing regret.</p>
<p>You know, the Chinese have been seeding clouds and shooting missiles at clouds for the last few years. We thought it was about climate control.  But now I know the real scoop.  They&rsquo;re trying to dispel the &#8216;evil&rsquo; in those clouds.</p>
<p>Fallout from Papal proclamations already costs us untold billions of dollars a year, so here&rsquo;s my modest proposal:  At Papal instigation, Western nations should expend what is left of their wealth in hiring the Chinese to go to Africa, to defeat those &#8216;Clouds of Evil&rsquo;.  After hundreds of billions of dollars &hellip;.(excuse me, I remembered we&rsquo;re in the Obama era, and decimals are marching to the right)&hellip;ahem&hellip;.After tens of TRILLIONS of dollars, the Pope can declare the evil clouds officially vanquished, and the Dark Continent will finally be bathed in heavenly light.</p>
<p>Just think!  Africans will stop their gruesome murders.  They will stop raping infants.  They will stop mutilating their own daughters. They will know sex only within the confines of a Christian marriage (and only for procreation). They will stop smoking their AIDS medications, and suddenly the epidemic will be OVER!  </p>
<p>Then, we can all stand around the Co&rsquo;-cola machine and sing &#8220;It&rsquo;s a Small World, After All&#8221;.  Africans will be just like us.  And, mirabile dictu, they will even stop naming their little boys &#8216;Lovelle&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Yes he is, witness his instructions to the Catholic schools in England to accomodate (surrrender to) muslims in those schools as articles here on AMREN have pointed out. The POPE has NO IDEA of what the muslim agenda is and appeasement is not the way to deal with them.</p>

			<p>I always thought that fear of an angry God was the only force that could save Africa from their backwards superstitions (like &#8220;Traditional African medicine&#8221;) but I doubt that now. Besides how many &#8220;christian&#8221; churches in Africa preach revolution theology? (or is that purely a developed world phenomena?)</p>

			<p>That evil cloud is actually a bio-weapon, containing the zombie virus from Resident Evil; however, don&rsquo;t expect anyone to notice a change in the behavior of the infected African. </p>
