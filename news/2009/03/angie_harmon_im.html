<h1>Angie Harmon: I&rsquo;m Not Racist Because I Disagree With Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hollie McKay, FOXNews, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Angie Harmon is not afraid to come out and say she doesn&rsquo;t like how President Obama is handling the job  &mdash;  but she&rsquo;s sick of having to defend herself from being deemed a racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&rsquo;s my problem with this, I&rsquo;m just going to come out and say it. If I have anything to say against Obama it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m a racist, it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t like what he&rsquo;s doing as President and anybody should be able to feel that way, but what I find now is that if you say anything against him you&rsquo;re called a racist,&#8221; Harmon told Tarts at Thursday&rsquo;s Los Angeles launch of the new eyelash-growing formula, Latisse. &#8220;But it has nothing to do with it, I don&rsquo;t care what color he is. I&rsquo;m just not crazy about what he&rsquo;s doing and I heard all about this, and he&rsquo;s gonna do that and change and change, so okay .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&rsquo;m still dressing for a recession over here buddy and we&rsquo;ve got unemployment at an all-time high and that was his number one thing and that&rsquo;s the thing I really don&rsquo;t appreciate. If I&rsquo;m going to disagree with my President, that doesn&rsquo;t make me a racist. If I was to disagree with W, that doesn&rsquo;t make me racist. It has nothing to do with it, it is ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of dislikes, the starlet has also had enough of the double-standards in the media.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think McCain would have done a better job, only because I think he has more experience. I also think if W or John McCain or Reagan would have gone and done a talk show, the backlash would have been so huge and in his face, and &#8216;What is our president doing? How unclassy!&rsquo; But Obama does it and no one says anything,&#8221; Harmon said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However Harmon is definitely in the Hollywood minority when it comes to her criticism of Obama as other lasses at the Latisse party were quick to advocate their unequivocal support.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ladies of &#8220;Entourage&#8221; certainly showed their Obama-loyalty too.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not an over night process. It&rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better; we&rsquo;re all kind of in the same boat now. Everybody&rsquo;s broke and everybody&rsquo;s struggling and he makes me feel like I know him and that I know Michelle and that they&rsquo;re like us and they&rsquo;re out to try to save the USA. It&rsquo;s just an amazing period to watch him take on these challenges and everyday in the news to hear about AIG or possibly global currency changing, it&rsquo;s incredible. He&rsquo;s facing big challenges and he&rsquo;s got a lot of support and I&rsquo;m just praying things get better,&#8221; Debi Mazar said, while co-star Perrey Reeves added that Obama is a &#8220;wonderful leader&#8221; and she&rsquo;s looking forward to his future endeavors.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re in a position now where anything anyone says to criticize Obama is deemed &#8220;racist&#8221; - as long the person doing the criticizing is White of course.  As a matter of fact anything that any White person says that&rsquo;s negative about any non-White at any time is &#8220;racist&#8221;.  This is how they shut White people up.  Most Whites are so frightened of that word (and a few others) that they immediately back down and keep silent.  And that piece of c_ _p Attorney General Holder has the gall to say we need a dialogue about race.  The second a dialogue begins Whites are labeled &#8220;racist&#8221;.  They don&rsquo;t want a dialogue.  They want to keep the monologue going - their monologue - that is.  They want to utterly destroy us.  They think they&rsquo;ve got us on the ropes now and they&rsquo;re trying to finish us off.</p>

			<p>This is a teachable moment   &mdash;   &#8220;racism&#8221; is a subjective term, so its definition is in the eye of the beholder.  Angie Harmon&rsquo;s definition does not include opposition to President Obama, while most of her peers do have that definition.</p>
<p>However, being accused (or presumably guilty) of this subjective accusation might as well be the death penalty for some people, Miss Harmon one of them.</p>
<p>The lesson for the day is for society not to worship subjective concepts.</p>

			<p>Immunizing a front man like Obama from criticism by libeling it as &#8220;racism&#8221; is a most clever way for our political elites to squelch democratic (small &#8220;d&#8221;) opposition.  It&rsquo;s probably the greatest single benefit to them of electing a black man to the office of President.</p>

			<p>A few years ago there were occasional comments on here that a black president would be a good thing. &#8216;Let&rsquo;s have the media grill a black president&rsquo;, they said. &#8216;Wait till the first political cartoon comes out.&rsquo;, &#8216;The late night comedians will have a field day.&rsquo;, &#8216;Wait till the new black president has to come up with an answer and there&rsquo;s no easy solution, and every side is against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I kind of believed those people. Now Jay Leno says he can&rsquo;t do jokes about Obama because, &#8220;he&rsquo;s too perfect&#8221;. Basically we have a black man who&rsquo;s president. Or in other words, a superman who can do no wrong and doesn&rsquo;t even have a weakness for good old kryptonite.</p>

<p>Weak remarks?  What was she supposed to say: that she doesn&rsquo;t like Obama because he&rsquo;s black (which, given her decidedly right-of-center politics, could very well be true)?  Do you know what the media would do to her?</p>

<p>Fact: EVERY right wing and race conscious individual (Whites, anyway) are forced to carefully monitor what they say for fear of being labelled a &#8220;racist.&#8221;  This woman didn&rsquo;t say anything with which I disagree.</p>
<p>So in answer to your question:  yes.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s funny, if you criticize Obama you hear his supporters say, &#8220;hey, he&rsquo;s only been on the job for two months, give him a chance&#8221;. But, these are the same people who have declared him a &#8220;wonderful leader&#8221; after only two months on the job.</p>

			<p>Later in the article we get the more typical Hollywood blond moment; From Mandy Moore. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s cool that he went on Leno and I watched the &#8220;60 minutes&#8221; interview as well last week. The guy is just so articulate and he is so well versed in something that is so new to him and I think he has a good team around him. It sounds cliché, but he makes me feel proud to be an American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yea he was so cool on Leno, Teleprompter Jesus commenting on his bowling score &#8220;It was like the Special Olympics or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then later on 60 Minutes&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sitting here. And you&rsquo;re &mdash;  you are laughing. You are laughing about some of these problems. Are people going to look at this and say, &lsquo;I mean, he&rsquo;s sitting there just making jokes about money &mdash; &rsquo; How do you deal with &mdash;  I mean: explain&hellip;&rdquo; Kroft asked at one point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you punch-drunk?&rdquo; Kroft said.</p>
<p>Thanks for proving the stereotype Mandy. </p>

			<p>Although I love Angie Harmon, her remarks are disconcerting - not what she had to say about the &#8220;Wonderful Leader,&#8221; but the fact that she had to address the issue of racism to begin with.</p>
<p>Liberals disgust me so thoroughly not because of what they think, but because they truly believe that what they think is so perfect that the rest of us should think that way as well. </p>
<p>The essence of living in a free society is doing what you want so long as it doesn&rsquo;t infringe on anyone else&rsquo;s safety or freedom. That&rsquo;s the infuriating thing about liberals - they strive to force their way of life on the rest of us (in a distorted Father-Knows-Best fashion), and in so doing, muzzle our free speech (with reckless accusations of racism) and put us in great jeopardy (with gun control, EEO, affirmative action, etc).</p>
<p>Why is it that any citizen, be they the beautiful Angie Harmon or a mere mortal like myself, has to carefully declare that their dissatisfaction with the president&rsquo;s decision making is not racist? Why should a political cartoonist fear for his job Salman Rushdie-style? </p>
<p>Speak your mind if the need arises. Stand your ground. Blacks are people, nothing more. They don&rsquo;t have special powers, and they&rsquo;re no better or worse than the rest of us. </p>

<p>Do they refer to the Great Black Father in Washington? (now)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the memo, so I don&rsquo;t know current policy&hellip;</p>

This is a good article, in its own small way, because it presents the idea that the word &#8220;racist&#8221; can be used incorrectly.</p>
<p>The more this idea is circulated, the better.</p>

			<p>But i thought once we had a &#8220;black president&#8221; in office, charges of racism, or racism in general, would no longer exist? This is suppose to be the whole idea-one of the main reasons- why Obama was elected. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>As far as Hollywood is concerned. Did anyone here watch the exceptance speech by actor Sean Penn, after he won the Academy Award this year? During his speech, he said something to the effect, that he was happy that we have a eloquent President (Obama,) in White House. To which the audience present  applauded him. Eloquent? Since when was H. Rap Brown or Huey Newton classified as being eloquent? </p>
<p>And who was more gracious and eloquent than Laura Bush, while she was in the White House? </p>

It has nothing to do with it, it is ridiculous.&rdquo; If I have anything to say against Obama it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m a racist, it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t like what he&rsquo;s doing as President &hellip; &ldquo;But it [race] has nothing to do with it, I don&rsquo;t care what color he is. &#8220;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I DO care, frankly.  It matters to me.   Race IS important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s encouraging to see someone who&rsquo;s speaking out. However, she&rsquo;s not really expressing my point of view or my concerns.  (Who is Angie Harmon anyway? And what makes her an expert on politics whom we should heed? I am tired of these Hollywood celebrities giving us political advice   &mdash;   of whatever stripe.)  <br>
 <br>
But when she got to her praise of McCain and Bush, that&rsquo;s when she left me completely!   No way!  Of course, I suppose no other criticism would  be allowed on Fox News, unless it was done on that basis  (of Democrats vs. Republicans).  She&rsquo;s still toeing the Hollywood line by denying race as a consideration, and in effect denouncing it.  Pathetic.   It&rsquo;s just not enough.</p>

			<p>For several years, this woman was a cast member of the shamelessly liberal propaganda outlet Law and Order (playing an assitant DA).  In this TV world, she prosecuted many &#8220;ripped-from-the-headline&#8221; cases, and helped clean the Streets of New York of all those nazis, klansmen, fundmentalist christian abortion clinic bombers, and white crack-whores.  Of course, in Law and Order, the white, middle-class guy is always guilty (quite unlike the actual crime demographics of NYC).  Even when a black or latino commits a crime, there&rsquo;s always some evil corporation which made him do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that her efforts in the field of propaganda have helped, in their own small way, make these circumstances she now finds herself in, where she is criticized as racist for daring to question our great leader.  She really has only herself to blame.</p>

			<p>I said it many many times, even before he got elected.If you disagree with Obama in any way at all you will be labeled a racist, period! Everybody knows that! &#8220;DUH&#8221;! Don&rsquo;t get me wrong,I applaud her courage.God bless her for speaking her mind.But don&rsquo;t forget that she&rsquo;s a liberal &#8220;Hollywoody&#8221; type.She&rsquo;ll get black-listed for sure(no pun intended). Now she&rsquo;ll have to start dating blacks or adopt a Somali baby or something&hellip;.Teach your children well&hellip;.</p>

			<p>So long as we&rsquo;re willing to discuss whether something or someone is &#8220;racist&#8221; or not, we&rsquo;re letting the other side control the terms of discourse.</p>
<p>Any such argument, whatever its topic or outcome, has the chief effect of strengthening the assumption that &#8220;racism&#8221; is bad.</p>
<p>When what whites need to do is become MORE &#8220;racist.&#8221; (i.e. to recover the attitudes that protected us up until about 60 years ago).</p>
<p>Anyone who like Ms. Harmon is charged with being &#8220;racist&#8221; should ideally respond, &#8220;&#8216;Racism&rsquo; is a silly word, just a conjurer&rsquo;s incantation to block thought, criticism, and white self-awareness. I don&rsquo;t pay any attention to it, and I just say what I wish to say, which is&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Never join any argument about &#8220;racism&#8221;. Just criticize that the arguers are even using the word.</p>
<p>Otherwise you cede the argument before you even begin.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that to call someone a &#8220;racist&#8221; is an abusive ad hominem devoid of cognitive meaning and simply name-calling? Don&rsquo;t read anymore into it than someone calling you a contemptibly obnoxious person. In fact, you might counter that you consider this filthy name-caller a contemptibly obnoxious person too.</p>

			<p>What she should have done is use left-wing tactics  &mdash;  -not even acknowledge that people have accused her of racism.  That&rsquo;s how the left works: &#8220;if you pretend the word doesn&rsquo;t exist, it doesn&rsquo;t&#8221;.  I would advise all of you who have not yet read 1984, by George Orwell, to read it soon, to better understand the far left and how truly fascist they are.  I must say, it&rsquo;s alarming how many parallels one can find between the themes of the novel and today&rsquo;s leftists.</p>

<p>They do have the backing and support of the federal government and the entire U.S. legal system to back them up though if they decide to cause you problems. That qualifies as super powers.</p>

			<p>There are two dangerous political cults in America:1)the cult of Barack Obama and 2) the cult of Ronald Reagan-John McCain(fake war hero McCain that is.)</p>
<p>Angie Harmon and her jock husband Jason Seahorn worship in the Ronald Reagan-John McCain cult. She describes herself as a conservative fanatical supporter of John McCain a politician who like Barack Obama is pro-open borders and pro-war(pro-death and destruction). What exactly is conservative about an open borders immigration policy and an endless wars foriegn policy. There is also no difference in Barack Obama&rsquo;s and Bush Ws  economic policy. In fact, Barack Obama is implementing the Bush-Paulson bailout of the banks and hedge funds.</p>
<p>Angie Harmon and her jock husband,former NY Giant reciever Jason Seahorn are fake conservatives. Why isn&rsquo;t &#8220;conservative&#8221; strong on defense Jason Seahorn serving in Iraq? Because, like every other Reagan-McCain &#8220;conservative&#8221;-Bill O&rsquo;rielly, Sean Hnnity and Rush-he is a coward.</p>

			<p>Of course. Labeling someone racist is just a political weapon. In Communist countries the hardliners would label the moderates &#8220;rightists&#8221; rather than address their concerns. If your goal is to be fair and just, you will consider everyone&rsquo;s ideas, and eliminate only ideas that don&rsquo;t work. But if your goal is do enforce a social order regardless what the people want, you will silence your opponents by labeling them. Some of those ideas may very well have merit, and that poses a threat to the Ruling Party&rsquo;s Social Order. </p>

<p>Very true.  Mr. Dumpty is EXACTLY right here!    They should not offer demurrers like someone who feels uneasily guilty and afraid they might be misunderstood.  That just confirms that racism is something evil and shameful.  Not what we wish to do!</p>
<p>As he says, if you offer any denials or apologies about presumed racism, that puts you immediately on the defensive and you have ceded the argument before you even begin.</p>

			<p>As some posters have said, the thing to do is to ignore the name calling and stop defending against the phony accusation of being a racists. This is just an obvious ploy not only to stop the person&rsquo;s criticism but to intimidate everyone else from similar criticisms. They want you to waste energy defending yourself.</p>
<p><b>Better to counter that your accusers are themselves &#8220;white-haters&#8221; or mindless &#8220;anti-white racists&#8221; who can only name call. Insult back!</b></p>

			<p>&#8220;the shamelessly liberal propaganda outlet Law and Order&#8221;</p>
<p>Law and Order is not so terribly liberal as you might think.  Sure, it might not show the true magnitude of minority crime in New York, but that&rsquo;s because it depicts interesting cases that show the ambiguity and nuance of the law (i.e. sometimes Good People do Bad Things).  Blacks and mestizos killing each other in the streets is neither nuanced nor thought-provoking.</p>

			<p>when someone calls you  a racist, then call them one right back, and remind them that they only voted for obama because he was black. white or black, they are still a racist for voting for him, because he had absolutly no qualificatiuons, never owned a business and only had 143 days as a senator, so just remind them they only voted for him because he was black, which makes them a racist.</p>

<p>Many of us have endured name calling for years, just because we disagree with the Black agenda. As long as name calling works, Blacks and liberals will continue to use it to get their way. Once people ignore the name calling, then it will lose its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Notice what happened when Rush Limbaugh didn&rsquo;t cave in. They quit trying to paint him as a racist. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you like him or not. The point is, when a person says what they feel or think, they shouldn&rsquo;t fall all over themselves trying to apologize if someones says they are offended. </p>

<p>Let the left control the debate?  The Right lost the debate and has no good responses to the issues at hand.  That is why GOP and others can only offer a rehashed &#8220;trickle down&#8221; budget to counter this administrations version.  All the right seems to want to do is go back to a time when things were better.  But we can&rsquo;t go back - it is actually impossible to do that, physically and even historically.  We are wasting time preaching to fewer and fewer listeners.  </p>
<p>A complete breakdown of everything is required for a new rise of White cultures and states.  I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is ready or really wants to go through that as it would be messy, i.e., bloody with decades if not an entire millenia of a new Dark Ages with wars, disease, famine, and insanity.  But such an era would test every race and culture.  The big, fat, soft people will die first.  So get on the scale and assess yourself seriously before you hope for a White revolution.  History does repeat itself, but never exactly and we have a real recipe for White disaster world wide should instability and national demise come nationally or world wide.</p>

			<p>The best argument against having a black man as President is that you&rsquo;ll always be called a racist for criticizing him.  Nobody was ever called a racist for criticizing George W. Bush.  I disagree with Obama on a number of things, none of them having to do with his race.  Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;stimulus package&#8221; is a monstrous bill with every cockamamie Democratic social spending program imaginable snuck into  it.  Obama wants to socialize medicine at a time when the government&rsquo;s existing Medicare and Medicaid programs are going bankrupt.  He won&rsquo;t enforce immigration law.  He says he wants to get us out of Iraq (good) but wants to put more troops in Afghanistan (give it up, <i>nobody</i> can successfully &#8220;nation build&#8221; in Afghanistan).  He tells us that we&rsquo;re going to have trillion dollar deficits for years to come and that we shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>One thing I won&rsquo;t criticize Obama for is the current recession and high unemployment rate.  The seeds of the current destruction were sown long before Obama became President.</p>
<p>The best I can say for Obama is that &#8220;mad bomber&#8221; McCain wouldn&rsquo;t have been any better.  The Republicans shot themselves in the foot when they nominated him.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t deny that you&rsquo;re exactly correct. They do enjoy a fundamental Double Standard and can essentially do as they please. </p>
<p>However, the whole matter infuriates me, and I&rsquo;m often driven to confront mouthy, hostile blacks anywhere I encounter them. It&rsquo;s simply my opinion that they feed on the desire of most white people to be civil and considerate, two concepts completely foreign to the black people who cause trouble. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single, with no children&hellip;however, I often wonder what sort of marginalized, oppressed existence I&rsquo;d be helping to deliver to the next generation of white people if I didn&rsquo;t present some sort of strength and defiance to obnoxious, hostile blacks. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I&rsquo;ve already said, you&rsquo;re exactly right. In the work place especially, they&rsquo;re completely untouchable. </p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;m sorry but that is a large part of the problem. Who gives a damn what the media will do? It is what will we do that is important. If we don&rsquo;t stand up now, speak up now and support all those who do we might as well die. They will grind us into to the ground otherwise.</p>

			<p><i>Did anyone here watch the exceptance speech by actor Sean Penn, after he won the Academy Award this year? During his speech, he said something to the effect, that he was happy that we have a eloquent President (Obama,) in White House.</i><br>
Posted by Rudy at 11:29 PM on March 31<br>
 <br>
Sean Penn is one of those liberal Hollywood actor/politicians who I really love to hate.<br>
Remember him in 2005 launching his own uncoordinated, unoffical rescue effort at hurricane Katrina affected New Orleans, complete with his own photographer? <br>
Check out photo of him wearing a bullet proof vest, bailing water out of his sinking boat. https://tinyurl.com/ey5lh<br>
And I assume at one point he must of asked himself, &#8220;as a straight white male (assuming) how do I get a oscar in hollywood?&#8221;<br>
Hmmmm&hellip;. <br>
In 2001 he was nominated as &#8216;best actor&rsquo; for his portrayal of a mentally retarded man (close but no cigar).<br>
Then in 2009 the only minority left for him to play as a white male, the &#8216;gay&rsquo; Harvey Milk (bulls eye oscar!!)<br>
Even then, apparently Penn &#8216;flamed&rsquo; Milk up. https://tinyurl.com/ddr7x5<br>
I wish AA or somebody would displace stars like him.<br>
I think guilt, estrogine and arrogance is what must drive liberal hollywood. <br>
And they must think that if that pander to every corrosive, divisive social group out there. It will somehow protect them from the guillotines once the next revolution gets started, as they are just regular Joes, who are just fighting for all of us[sic].</p>

I would strongly disagree Obama is already a joke in fact the New York Times actually wrote ann extremely positive piece on McCain a few weeks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/us/politics/07mccain.html?hp" rel="nofollow">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/us/politics/07mccain.html?hp</a></p>
<p>The Washington Post also wrote some very positive things about McCain as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/22/AR2009012203928.html?hpid=topnews" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/22/AR2009012203928.html?hpid=topnews</a></p>
<p>In fact Newsweek even wrote an article on Liberal Economist Paul Krugman emerging as an opponent of the Obama/Geithner styled bailout:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/id/191393" rel="nofollow">https://www.newsweek.com/id/191393</a></p>
<p>I have yet to read an article that endoreses the Obama/Geithner bailout or his attempt to force GM into bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Although I understand the situation is probably worse than what the press potrays it as there is no doubt in my mind that even the liberals aren&rsquo;t buying what Obama is selling because no is bothering to defend his policies.</p>
<p>Of course never mind all the Obama teleprompter blogs out there.  </p>
<p>Everyone is understand&rsquo;s the new President just isn&rsquo;t up to the job even by comparison to his immediate predecessor,especially the liberal press.  </p>

It reminds me of the article here about kindergarden kids in England that were criticized b/c they said they didn&rsquo;t like &#8220;ethnic&#8221; food (don&rsquo;t remember what food it was). If 3 year olds can&rsquo;t say &#8220;yuck&#8221; about food they hate w/o being called a racist, what&rsquo;s the wonder people have to say &#8220;Heil Obama&#8221; lest they are branded racist?</p>

<p>Well, for starters, people who like to work for a living.  The media is quite capable of fixing it so that any White who voices their opinion truthfully on racial issues would have a great deal of difficulty holding a job (at least one that pays a livable wage).</p>
<p>People who also want to avoid death threats from non-Whites would give a damn.  It&rsquo;s easy to pish posh others who are leery of bringing the wrath of the media down on them, but tell me: how vocal are you in expressing your views on race?<br>

			<p>The issue of race and racism fails to appear in any of the world&rsquo;s Bibles, so if the Almighty considers it to be of no consequence then so should we.  Besides, the word &#8220;racism&#8221; didn&rsquo;t even exist until it was coined in 1933 by minority pandering Marxist academia and is therefore unworthy of use in our society&hellip;<br>
