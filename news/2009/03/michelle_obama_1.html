<h1>Michelle Obama Once Teased for Talking &#8216;Like a White Girl&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Sweet, Chicago Sun-Times, March 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For her own Women&rsquo;s History Month assignment, first lady Michelle Obama visited Anacostia High School, on the poor side of town, where on Thursday she surprised a group of students. One of her goals is to demystify the White House and make it more accessible to the people who live here.</p>
<p>Mrs. Obama told the youngsters she felt isolated from an institution in her own community when she was growing up and that she suspected they may view the White House and the Capitol the way she saw the University of Chicago as a young girl  &mdash;  a place for other people. She shared her story of how she was taunted for talking &#8220;like a white girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Raised on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side, Mrs. Obama told the students that while she lived near the university, as a kid, she never even took a &#8220;walk on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I didn&rsquo;t think they wanted to have anything to do with me. So we never connected  &mdash;  me and many kids like me in our community, and that big old institution,&#8221; said Mrs. Obama, who became a U. of C. Medical Center executive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mrs. Obama told the students it&rsquo;s cool to be smart.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I didn&rsquo;t care whether it was cool because I remember there were kids around my neighborhood who would say, &#8216;Ooh, you talk funny, you talk like a white girl.&rsquo; I heard that growing up my whole life. I was like, I don&rsquo;t even know what that means, but you know what, I&rsquo;m still getting my A.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I am a few years younger that Michelle Obama. I am a 40 year old Black man. </p>
<p>When I was in high school. I associated with 5 other guys. Two White (one White and jewish) Black and one Asian. We were consdered nerds. We were all under 5&rsquo;5, weighed less than 150 lbs and were not all that athletically inclined. However, we all were academically strong students. We got teased occasionaly by the jocks, but never physically harrasssed or anything like that.</p>
<p>I myself was shy and introverted. Most of us were relatively quiet. None of us dated while in high school although I don&rsquo;t think anyone expected us to. Two of us ended up attending ivy league schools (not me, I went to Bucknell Universty, which is s very good school)for my undergraduate years majoring in History. I earned my Ph.D. degree from the University of Iowa in American Studies, another good school. I am currently an independent consultant and public speaker. I make a handsome living.</p>
<p>My point is that kids tease other kids regardless of race. In fact. I am still in touch with one of my high school friends -Abraham. He is a very successful medical doctor. </p>
<p>Teasing is a part of growing up. Michelle seems to have done <br>
alright in spite of it.</p>

			<p>From her recorded public speeches I&rsquo;d guess   &mdash;   without the video or prior knowledge of her identity   &mdash;   that she is a black middle age woman from the South Side of Chicago haltingly reading a teleprompter.</p>

<p>And her husband &#8220;thinks like a white person&#8221; too, I presume (let&rsquo;s face it: Raised partially by white grandparents, then sent to mostly-white private schools and universities? If Obama&rsquo;s father was a white British colonial administrator from Kenya in an alternate world, would <i>you</i> notice any major difference - outside the fact he&rsquo;d be a middle manager or some other job out of public view?)</p>

			<p>So she didn&rsquo;t know what the &#8220;teasing&#8221; meant.  I bet.  Notice how she does not accuse the black girls taunting her of racism or of hating white people.  Probably because only white people are racists and &#8220;haters&#8221;.</p>

			<p>You know, that reminds me of the character Calpurnia in &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#8221;  When asked by Scout why she talks like blacks around other blacks when she knows better, Calpurnia explains that if she talked like white folks around other blacks, they&rsquo;d think she was &#8220;putting on airs fit to beat Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tells you something about blacks in general, doesn&rsquo;t it?  I know of very few blacks who don&rsquo;t mangle the English language.</p>

			<p>Whites usually don&rsquo;t analyze articles like this about black public figures. So let&rsquo;s analyze it:</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Obama told the youngsters she felt isolated from an institution in her own community when she was growing up and that she suspected they may view the White House and the Capitol the way she saw the University of Chicago as a young girl &mdash; a place for other people.</i></p>
<p>So she had a chip on her shoulder from an early age? Is this why she wasn&rsquo;t proud of her country until she thought her husband had a chance of getting into the White House? And is she saying the only way she thinks blacks can get rid of this chip on their shoulders is to think they also have a chance of getting into the White House?</p>
<p>Also, as  Tom in MI pointed out, is not the derisive statement &#8220;you talk like a white girl&#8221; not a horribly racist thing to say? Of course the liberals will tell us that it&rsquo;s okay for blacks to be racist because of what happened to their great, great grandparents over 150 years ago, but it&rsquo;s not okay for a white to be racist because he was mugged by a black man last week? That&rsquo;s liberal &#8220;logic&#8221; for you.</p>

I am grateful for this confirmation of the &#8220;stereotype&#8221; that blacks who are serious and intelligent, even barely, are accused of &#8220;acting white&#8221; by other blacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the point made many times in print, but when it comes directly from a black it gains credibility.  They really do feel alienated from education and the proper use of the English language.</p>

			<p>When she was in college this same Michelle said she was robbed of her blackness, and so was making it her mission to desperately get in touch with it, as should all oppressed black people. I guess at that point, at Princeton, she had to worry about getting good grades. </p>

			<p>I notice that of all the various racial and ethnic groups in America, it is only blacks who consider it uncool to speak standard English (&#8220;talking white&#8221;).  If you listen to a second or third generation American Chinese, Japanese, or Indian speaking in an adjacent room, you would not be able to tell him from a white American.</p>

			<p>Imagine if Barbara Bush had spoken with a class about a childhood incident where she was teased about &#8220;speaking like a black girl.&#8221;  What&rsquo;s so laughable is that most people won&rsquo;t even see the double standard.<br>

			<p>If you google her speeches, you will hear her admitting that she wasn&rsquo;t intelligent enough to get into Princeton - she implies that the only reason she eventually WAS admitted was the  result of some sort of cosmic racial justice. </p>
<p>Read her college &#8220;thesis&#8221; if you haven&rsquo;t done so already to get the full scope of the limited intellect of this angry individual : </p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8642.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8642.html</a></p>
<p>(I&rsquo;d be angry too if I were born her). </p>
<p>I could almost get used to looking at the Accidental President, but when M.O. appears on my screen my reaction is so visceral that I actually have to scream. She literally makes me ill, physically - and I promise you that I am not even exaggerating here.</p>

			<p>This is hilarious. I was flipping the stations the other day and stopped when some girl on The Real World made a comment to her black female roommate that Obama &#8220;sounded white&#8221;. Oh! The black girl got her neck moving and waving her finger in the air as she set the white girl straight. </p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m paraphrasing as I don&rsquo;t recall verbatim what she said)</p>
<p>&#8220;That is racist! Obama is all-black! People always try to take away from something a black person does   &mdash;   that he couldn&rsquo;t do it as a black MAN!&#8221; </p>
<p>She went on and on. The white girl was visibly shocked and bewildered and never said anything in response. Lessons learned? Whites learn that they need to tiptoe around blacks for fear of being screamed at and called a racist. Blacks learn that whites are easily intimidated and that that is the way to treat whites.</p>

<p>Right up until the last act of the battered wife syndrome is played out: A violent reaction all out of proportion to the trigger, as in the case of the wife who shot her abusive husband twenty-two times with a single shot .22 rifle. She knew that he had been drinking the night before, and was going to beat her when he woke up, so she stopped him.</p>

Good for you Vincent.  But I think you are missing the point.  Yes, kids are teased in school, but there is an attitude among a huge segment of the Black population that anything intellectual is &#8220;White&#8221; and somehow beneath them. Then they blame their lack of achievement on Whites. Even though Michelle Obama was placed in a school above her abilities by White created affirmative action and later given a sinecure by the same, she did refuse to become part of the Black underclass with all of its self destructive pathologies.  And that, in itself is a notable act.</p>

&#8220;&lsquo;Ooh, you talk funny, you talk like a white girl.&rsquo; I heard that growing up my whole life. I was like, I don&rsquo;t even know what that means&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
You don&rsquo;t even know what that means? Are you serious? </p>
<p>Then let me explain it to you, Mrs. President. It means this: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Deep down, most of us blacks KNOW we&rsquo;re too ignorant to talk correctly   &mdash;   so when smarter blacks like you do it, it reminds us of our own inferiorities and shortcomings. So we don&rsquo;t want YOU doing it, either. And to stop you, we&rsquo;ll accuse you of the most HORRIBLE thing we can think of: acting like  the hated WHITE PEOPLE! Because us blacks are like crabs in a barrel   &mdash;   anytime one of us seems to be climbing up, we do our best to pull &#8216;em back down!&#8221;  </p>
<p><br>
Hope that clears it up for you, Michelle. </p>

			<p>Blacks are jealous of Whites.  Think about it.  If you were Black, wouldn&rsquo;t you be?  Whites are better looking and more intelligent.  Blacks know despite their lower IQ that if they &#8220;try to be like Whites&#8221; they&rsquo;re not going to be successful.  Most can&rsquo;t so why try? They feel awkward around Whites, unless of course it&rsquo;s on the street or the athletic field, then they become motivated to &#8220;kick Whitey&rsquo;s ass&#8221;.  In the workplace they are &#8220;one down&#8221;, unless of course it&rsquo;s a city, state or federal job and they&rsquo;re in a department or agency where they have numbers at or beyond the &#8220;point of critical mass&#8221;, then they think &#8216;dey is bad&rsquo;.  This is one reason why our city, state and federal agencies are in such horrendous condition.</p>

<p>Yes, kids tease others &hellip;. and worse.  Kids can be very cruel.  If Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s worst abuse was to be teased about talking &#8220;like a white girl&#8221;,  then she should count herself lucky. </p>
<p>She seems to have done alright, yes, but evidently she didn&rsquo;t have to face too much either.<br>

			<p>Factoid: In school in the 1950&rsquo;s, Black gals (and guys) from lower-middle income families spoke standard English. In fact, I heard them tease Blacks from the South about non-standard grammar and pronunciation. </p>

<p>I would argue that there is a large degree of anti-intellectualism among all races in Amrica. This has particularly been the case since the 1980s.</p>
<p>I am even seeing it in tihs current generations of young Asians.</p>

<p>It sure looks like that way to me&hellip;</p>
