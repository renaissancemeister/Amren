<h1><a href="https://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=93251">Obama Seeks Muslims for White House Posts</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WorldNetDaily, March 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama is conducting his own affirmative action program to get more Muslims in the White House.</p>
<p>The move began with Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn, who took his oath of office with a hand on the Quran, to solicit the resume of what he considered to be the nation&rsquo;s most qualified adherents of Islam.</p>
<p>According to the Denver Post, when White House officials heard about the program, it was put on overdrive.</p>
<p>So far, 45 Ivy League grads, Fortune 500 executives and government officials have been submitted for consideration.</p>
<p>J. Saleh Williams, program coordinator for the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association, sifted through more than 300 names as part of the search.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was mostly under the radar,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;We thought it would put (the president) in a precarious position. We didn&rsquo;t know how closely he wanted to appear to be working with the Muslim American community.&#8221;</p>

						</p>
						<p>As-Salaamu-Alaykum,</p>
<p>With the transition to the 111th Congress, there will be many new job opportunities in the U.S. Congress. The Congressional Muslim Staffers Association (CMSA) is pleased to announce our call for resumes to be included in a CMSA Resume Book. It is an objective of the CMSA to increase diversity on Capitol Hill through the recruitment, retention and promotion of Muslims and people of color in staff positions throughout Congressional Offices and Committees.</p>
<p>Please carefully read the following directions to submit your resume into the CMSA Resume Book:</p>
<p>Eligibility for Resume Submission: Resumes are requested from individuals who:</p>
<p>· Are U.S. Citizens</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Resumes must be submitted to cmsa.resume@gmail.com by Saturday, November 29th at NOON. Resumes should be no longer than two pages in length and display your full name and contact information on both pages. Please attach your resume to an email as a word document.</p>
<p>Congressional Positions: in the Subject heading of the email please include your full name followed by the position you are seeking.</p>
<p>Example: Subject: Fatimah Hassan, Legislative Director</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If you are considering more than one position, please state your top choice in the subject heading and your preferences in order of &#8220;1st Priority&#8221; and &#8220;2nd Priority&#8221; in the body of the email.</p>

<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We look forward to your participation in this effort! Please send an email to cmsa.resume@gmail.com with any questions.

			<p>The hard truth of the matter is that the Bush administration was almost as bad as pandering to Muslims in his White House, even after 9/11.  In fact it got worse after 9/11, as the President thought he could win a war against a tactic by pandering to the kind of people who gravitate toward that tactic.</p>

			<p>In Orlando, Central Florida, the locals are apt to call the place &#8220;little San Juan.&#8221;  Yet, at least PR&rsquo;s have a claim on the US.  Also, in the past 10 years or so, the number of Mexicans and Central Americans have increased significantly.  Lately, though, I&rsquo;ve observed more and more Muslims  &mdash;  mostly women, as they stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>These women are not what you might expect: that is, &#8220;casual&#8221; Muslim-ettes wearing a simple head scarf.  Instead, they appear Talibanish inside their black tents, allowing only an eye slit.  Standing next to them engenders an uncanny, almost frightful feeling of unease.  You cannot see their face, and cannot tell of their expression.  In fact, they present as expressionless zombies.</p>
<p>This weekend I observed one in our downtown park; she seemed to be a white woman from the little I could view of her eyes, accompanying a large black (not Middle Eastern) man along with two race-mixed kids.  The black man was visibly angry, yelling something at the kids as the woman walked in silence several steps back.  I imagined that the woman was in for a beating later that evening, as is the custom for Muslims when things do not go the man&rsquo;s way.  I thought, what kind of Western woman, especially a white woman, would agree to this kind of mental and physical abuse?  And what kind of man would treat his wife like some sort of sub-human animal?</p>
<p>Today, at a book store, I saw two more women dressed in their head to toe black sack-tents.  I&rsquo;m telling you, these people give me the creeps.  With any other group you can at least get an idea of what they are up to by examining facial expressions.  Say what you will about your run of the mill black, Hispanic, Asian, and so forth, but there is nothing more alien to Western civilization, IMO, than these Islamic automatons.</p>

 Makes about as much sense as inviting Rommell to sit around the map table with Ike and Monty. On second thought, Rommell was one of the good guys too,  if you use our politicians of today as a yardstick&hellip;<br>

			<p> Muslims for Obama, huh? Congressional Muslim Staffers Association? Looks like Barack (Please don&rsquo;t call me Hussein) Obama is rapidly unmasking now that he&rsquo;s safely in the White House for the next four years. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a Muslim,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been a Christian for over 20 years,&#8221; he said. Really, Mr. President? And if you&rsquo;re recruiting more Muslims to staff government, in the name of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; then how can you not also be seeking more Hindus? More Buddhists? More Sikhs? Sounds like you were   &mdash;   oh, shall we say, a little less than candid   &mdash;   about your personal background, Sheikh Barack!</p>

			<p>First we had affirmative action for blacks.  Then we had affirmative action for women.  Then we had affirmative action for illegal immigrants.  Then we had affirmative action for homosexuals and the transgendered.  Now we have affirmative action for Muslims.  It will never end.  I hope all you white women reading this will note the company in which you have been placed.</p>

			<p>I thought that the Constitution said something about government establishing a religion. That would include giving a religion special privileges. Looks like obama doesn&rsquo;t really give one damn about the Constitution.</p>

			<p>One way to combat this is to flood that email address with fake resumes.  Make them up with perfect left-leaning credentials and educational backgrounds.  Make whomever looks at these resumes mouth water.  Then let them see how much time they have to waste to sort through them all.</p>

			<p>Of course, Muslims can serve in the White House, the Pentagon, or the CIA.  On the other threads you complain about the Constitution and Rights.  Guess what?  You can&rsquo;t complain about non-discrimination based on religion.</p>

			<p><i>The hard truth of the matter is that the Bush administration was almost as bad as pandering to Muslims in his White House, even after 9/11.

<p>A fact that I see getting little traction even in European ethnic nationalist circles is that a European ethnic nationalist immigration policy would have prevented 9/11.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no comeback for this (except a compromise, e.g., &#8220;a ban on immigration from the Muslim world would&rsquo;ve been sufficient&#8221;).  All the lemmings can do in response is crow about &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;American values,&#8221; &#8220;freedom,&#8221; and other irrelevancies (as if &#8220;racism&#8221; matters in a homogeneous society, as if Americans weren&rsquo;t Americans, or free, before 1965).  Which essentially proves a direct causal link between &#8220;diversity&#8221; and 9/11.  To me, this suggests that 9/11 should be first on the list when we do what lemmings hate, i.e., tally the bill for &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  Then it&rsquo;s a short walk to wondering aloud what will be the next 9/11 to be laid at the foot of diversity.</p>

			<p>Hey Black Insurgent, the issue is not whether a Muslim man can serve in our government.  The issue is whether we need yet more set asides and quotas, this time for Muslims.  I happen to work with a young Muslim man who is as decent a person as you will ever meet.  But my boss didn&rsquo;t say, &#8220;Oh my gosh, we don&rsquo;t have enough Muslims here!&#8221; and insist that the next hire be one.</p>

			<p>I thought wearing head and body coverings was out.  Does this progressive new attitude of acceptance toward religious and cultural expression invite the resurgence of another American-American organization that included head coverings and robes to protect the identity of the members.   After all, that organization should now have the same right to freedom of expression and assembly.  To demonstrate this group&rsquo;s religious component, an icon such as a cross might be used&hellip;</p>
<p>Where is the ACLU when you really need it?!!</p>
