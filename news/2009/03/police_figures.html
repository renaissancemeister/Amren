			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Copenhagen Post, March 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Recent gang-related gun violence in Copenhagen weighs heavily in the latest national crime statistics</p>
<p>The latest figures from the National Centre for Investigation (NEC), outlining gang membership and arrests in Denmark, show a sharp increase in the number of gang-related shootings.</p>
<p>In 2007, police registered 28 shooting episodes, of which 12 were attributed to gangs currently being monitored by the authorities. Last year, that figure rose to 167 shootings, of which 76 were gang-related.</p>
<p>Police continuously monitor 80 different biker and immigrant gangs, including support groups for each. Police keep tabs on a total of 944 gang members  &mdash;  585 associated with the bikers and 359 linked to immigrant gangs.</p>
<p>More than 6,500 sentences were handed down to gang members and their support groups by Danish courts last year amounting to 2,228 years in prison terms.</p>
<p>The NEC is the police branch responsible for the investigation of organised crime, within and outside Denmark&rsquo;s borders. In its latest report, investigators fingered the struggle for the control of the drugs market as the primary cause of tension between the biker and immigrant criminals.</p>
<p>Throughout last year, the Hells Angels bikers established ten new AK81 support groups to help strengthen their position and mark their territory. AK81 means Altid Klar (always ready), with 81 representing the numeral letters of the alphabet  &mdash;  H and A.</p>
<p>The national police also highlighted the age difference between the bikers and their opposition. The average age of a Hells Angels member is 39 years old, while the immigrant gangs are on average ten years younger.</p>
<p>Members of the AK81 support group average 27 years old.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like them and wouldn&rsquo;t socialize with them but they are a reserve army that can be counted on should the Islamics try anything funny in Denmark.</p>

			<p>Again with the weasel words &#8220;gun violence&#8221;   &mdash;   the guns didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>6500 sentences for 2228 years in prison   &mdash;   that works out to a little more than 4 months per sentence.  Talk about hard time.  </p>
<p>These liberal Europeans want diversity on the one hand, but they want to continue their northern European customs and folkways on the other, such as a big welfare state, few prisons, short prison terms and no death penalty.  Square peg, round hole.</p>

			<p>This is unusual for the HA.  </p>
<p>In Canada, the gang sub-contracts its drug dealing to other ethnicities, who can&rsquo;t really be contained from starting their own drug smuggling routes.</p>
<p>In a small country like Denmark, there just isn&rsquo;t room for competition, or multi-racial co-existance.</p>

<p>Why is it that, when Danish youth lose any affinity that they have for crime, Danish authorities decide to import more?</p>

<p>You have a misconception. The average age of ethnic Dane criminals will be higher because the Danes have an inverted population pyramid. The average age for immigrant criminals will be lower because they have an upwards pointing population pyramid. Its thus inherent that Danish criminals will be of a higher age and it does not mean that young Danes have lost their affinity for crime. </p>
