<h1><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bearbile28-2009mar28,0,4159790.story">Woman Staying in Los Angeles Accused in Bear Bile Importation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Victoria Kim, Los Angeles Times, March 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><br/>
A South Korean woman staying in Los Angeles was charged by federal authorities Friday with illegally importing more than two pounds of bear bile, used for medicinal purposes and as an aphrodisiac in some Asian communities.</p>
<p>Seongja Hyun, 36, was arrested Thursday night by agents investigating a package of green crystallized bear bile from China. Because bears are protected under an international treaty and the Endangered Species Act, bear products can be imported only with government-issued export or import permits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bear bile, typically extracted from a living bear through a tube surgically inserted into the animal&rsquo;s gallbladder, is considered a treatment for conjunctivitis, jaundice and hemorrhoids, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities estimated that the bile could be sold for more than $400,000. Hyun told authorities that she had planned to sell the bile in the package for $3,000 or $4,000, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Agents obtained a warrant to search the Koreatown apartment where Hyun was staying and found additional bear bile, more than 100 empty vials, a measuring scale with dark- colored residue, and a diary written in Korean with dates and prices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hyun told authorities she did not know it was illegal to import bear bile in the U.S. because it is common in China, according to the affidavit. She said she entered the U.S. last month and brought bear bile in her checked baggage. Illegal smuggling carries a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years.</p>

			<p>Yellow people are the most cruel people to animals. I firmly believe that it is genetic.Just walk through any Chinatown in any city that has one,and see how they treat the creatures that they are trying to sell for the purpose of eating them.In China, they have bears in tiny cages,with tubes going into their gall bladders, extracting bile from them.They believe that rhino horn will make them more sexually verile, as if they really need that.That is why rhinos are so near to extinction. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m one of those AmRenners who generally has no problem with Asians. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;d want to see my fellow white people displaced by them, but overall I find Asians intelligent and worthy of my respect, admiration, friendship, etc. The only other race besides whites whom I consider more-or-less our equals. </p>
<p>That said, despite their being such a smart bunch of people, reading AmRen has alerted me to the fact that a lot of Asians believe some awfully silly things. Many of those silly things have to do with folk remedies   &mdash;   and especially for complaints of a sexual nature. Bear bile as aphrodisiac? Really? Have the famously scientific Asians ever actually TESTED this in a lab? Is there really ANY scientific basis for this OR ANY OTHER of the East&rsquo;s various animal-based sex-cure claims? </p>
<p>And if not, could be we please stop torturing and killing various endangered species over it? I&rsquo;m no animal-rights nut. If extracting bear bile might be used to cure cancer, that would be different. But I&rsquo;m against hurting/killing animals for medicinal quackery THAT DOESN&rsquo;T WORK. </p>
<p>Although now that I think about it, I suppose white people believe some pretty silly nonsense and superstitions, too. Like Multiculturalism. Like &#8220;Diversity is our strength.&#8221; Like the idea that race doesn&rsquo;t matter. </p>
<p>Hey, it doesn&rsquo;t get get much sillier than that. </p>

<p>It is common in China, marijuana is common in the U.S. but neither circumstance makes the stuff legal. I think it is illegal in China but I could be wrong, saw a program on it once and it was NOT being obtained in any legal looking manner.</p>

<p>You have no problem with having millions of asians in America because you are commonly known as a race traitor. That is to say you approve of the colonization of Native Born White Americans towns,cities and university systems by post-1965legal asian immigrants and their &#8220;american&#8221; born geneline.</p>
<p>You also approve of the economic terror that thousands of Native Born White Americans have experienced becasue of the presence of post-1965 asians in American labor markets.</p>
<p>Asians and other post-1965 LEGAL immigrants are ultimatley the most serious threat to America&rsquo;s endangered species because of their very high fertility level combined with a total lack of an environmental ethic. This observation should be stated loudly and clearly in public.</p>
<p>You are just another example of a white guy whose racial allegiance changed to an pan-asian allegiance upon either marraige to an asian or dating of an asian. This why White Nationlalist are opposed to race mixing.</p>
<p>The introduction of the chinese snakehead fish threatens the ecological stability off the Potamic river and several other rivers in the the south east. It is now known that the snakehead fish was introduced into the Potamic river by an chinese LEGAL immigrant. It is also well knwon that the Korans in LA are illegally importing snakehead fish.</p>
<p>Post-1965 LEGAL immigrant asians are without a doubt, a very serious threat to America&rsquo;s ecosytems. Just think of how much of a threat they would be to America&rsquo;s endangered species and ecosystems if there were 50 millin asians in American.</p>

<p>LEGAL asian IMMIGRANTS expect Native Born White Americans to put up with an immigration policy that they wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate for one second for their own nations of origin.</p>
<p>The LEGAL IMMIGRANTS and their &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline belong on their own turf where they would not be able to wage an agressive race war against Native Born White Americans within the borders of America. And they can take their snakehead fish and other invasive species.</p>
<p>If American society implodes into a state of chaos, there will be 0 tolerance for post-1965 LEGAL IMMIGRANT ASIANS and its asian &#8220;American&#8221; geneline.</p>
<p>There is no demographic,economic and ecological justification for post-1965 LEGAL asian immigrants.</p>
<p>There is no environmental movement in America. It exist only in name. What passess for an environmnetal movement has been hijacked by pro-corporate liberals and weirdo lefties who advocate the  importation high fertility post-1965 non-white immigrants while at the same time telling-for years- Native Born White Americans to keep their fertility very low. These liberal-left weirdos are waging an agressive race war against Native Born White Americans. The environemntal movement in America is a joke.</p>
<p>The blessings of post-1965 non-white diversity over time will result in the destruction of AMERICA&rsquo;s wildlife and and biodiversity in general&hellip; and after that&hellip; life sustaining ecosystems. </p>
<p>You think the waiting list to get into Yellow Stone is long now..just wait when the post-1965 non-wites start going theri in large numbers. And it wont just be Yellow Stone&hellip;Every major National and State park will have very long waiting lists&hellip;.your family will be waiting years to get in to the great National and State Parks. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Woman staying in los Angeles&#8221; Is that REALLY the headline??</p>
<p>You can imagine the debate for this one&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay here&rsquo;s the headline &#8220;Los Angeles woman&hellip;.&#8221; &#8220;NO! She&rsquo;s not from Los Angeles&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Korean Woman&hellip;.&#8221; &#8220;NO!, that implies that what she did has something to do with her being from Korea&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreign woman&hellip;.&#8221; &#8220;NO! That implies there is criminality among foreigners&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal immigrant wom&hellip;.&#8221; &#8220;NO, NO, NO! You have to get off this track of racism against her, we&rsquo;re journalists for f***s sake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay eeerm, how about &#8220;Woman staying in Los Angeles?&#8221; &#8220;Perfect, that makes her nationality and race of no significance. Even though we will state these details in the story, the headline makes it seem as if she could just as easily been a white woman from Idaho &#8220;staying in Los Angeles&#8221;</p>

			<p>While whites may be the only people who collectively don&rsquo;t want to see animal cruelty up close and personal, what we do to animals in our science labs and on our factory farms is still disgraceful.</p>
