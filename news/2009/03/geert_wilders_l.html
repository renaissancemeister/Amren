			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruno Waterfield, Telegraph (London), March 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain&rsquo;s controversial ban on the anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders has pushed his Freedom Party into the lead for the first time, according to Dutch opinion polls.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders began to see a rise in his popularity after an Amsterdam appeals court decided to try him for anti-Muslim comments in January Photo: EPA</p>
<p>Mr Wilders has benefited from the publicity provided by Dutch and international headlines that followed a decision last month to ban him from showing his anti-Muslim film, Fitna, in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>His attempt to enter Britain, his detention and subsequent deportation, following an order by Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, have made the Dutch MP into a free speech martyr and celebrity in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>New opinion polling now puts Mr Wilders ahead of the Christian Democrats, who lead a coalition government.</p>
<p>&#8220;How happy I am about this. These are of course just polls, but it is an enormous sign of confidence from the Dutch voter,&#8221; said Mr Wilders.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as I am concerned, elections can be held tomorrow, then I will be the next premier&#8221;.</p>
<p>Polling by Maurice de Hond has predicted that the Freedom Party or PVV would take 18 per cent of the vote to win 27 seats in the 150-seat Dutch parliament.</p>
<p>This would put Mr Wilders in the position of being a power broker and prime minister in a traditionally complicated Dutch multi-party coalition.</p>
<p>Bans and the threat of prosecution have been the making of Mr Wilders and his Freedom Party.</p>
<p>The Dutch MP, who has compared the Koran to Hitler&rsquo;s Mein Kampf, began to see a rise in his popularity after an Amsterdam appeals court decided to try him for anti-Muslim comments in January.</p>
<p>He then became an international celebrity after he was refused permission to enter Britain on public order grounds in February.</p>
<p>In contrast, the United States last week decided not to ban Mr Wilders after he arrived to show his anti-Muslim film on Capitol Hill at the invitation of the Republican Senator Jon Kyl.</p>
<p>According to the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad, only 40 people turned up to see the 15-minute film, which compares Islam to Nazism.<br/>

		<p>American populists, WN please take notice:</p>
<p>&#8220;anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders has pushed his Freedom Party into the lead for the first time&#8221;</p>
<p>That means Geert Wilder is THE MOST POPULAR POLITICAL LEADER in the Netherlands/Holland, his party surging to #1 position.</p>
<p>I am sure there is probably some nice, principled 85 year old Libertarian Constitutionalist in Holland who doesn&rsquo;t ever win more than 1% of public support, same as they do here in the USA.</p>
<p>Europeans, Westerners, White Americans do not like Islamic extremist immigrants, they don&rsquo;t like anything about them, they fear them - with good reason. White Christians feel this way, so do White Liberals, White gays - it&rsquo;s a winning position to take a courageous stand against the Muslim immigration invasion and works well against all NW immigration - they could become Jihadists (Or gang members).</p>
<p>So what is the moral of this story?</p>
<p>Go with what works! Stop pushing these Contrarian Libertarian Constitutionalists true believers who can&rsquo;t accept the truth that all humans are not the same and all will not be OK if the world embraces free market economics, American style individualism.</p>
<p>If Vlad the Impaler - Dracula or Charles Martel had not fought the Muslim invaders and had instead wasted their lives pushing this libertarian free market cult, Romanians and French people would spit at the mention of their names, instead they are beloved national heroes.</p>
<p>Great job Geert Wilders! <br/>

<p>Never surrender to Islam. Expel Arabs, Kurds, Somali and a sizable portion of Turks from Europe. </p>
<p>How sad that I want Europeans to expel my own people. However, Islam is a contagious disease and there is no known cure for it.</p>

<p>thank you</p>
<p>I guess in 40 years, when I&rsquo;m an old fart and about to retire, I&rsquo;ll be able to take my grandchildren to the Netherlands-and it won&rsquo;t be an outpost of Islamic Algeria!  YEEEEEHAAAAW!</p>

		<p>I get that a lot of AMREN readers are baffled by the fact that growing numbers of Europeans want to end Muslim immigration and influence BOT to act like small town midwestern Americans, but insetad so they can get on with being an oasis of ultra high tech, gay friendly, sexually liberated, darwin celebrating, left wing, social democratic, cutting edge 21st century culture in a violent and chaotic world. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just how it is.</p>
<p>What is important is that racial Europeans all around the world, but especially in Europe and N AM, have the guts to determine their own futures for themselves, whatever that means. </p>

		<p>With so many AmRen articles exposing the racial cancer in the USA, it&rsquo;s incredibly uplifting to hear of a (formerly?) very &#8220;liberal&#8221; European country truly upholding the ideals of free speech and free association.</p>
<p>Positive news in this struggle is rare, but if Geert Wilders really does become the PM of the Netherlands it will give me immense hope that our side of the struggle can prevail before we reach the point of no return.</p>
<p>I myself find nothing more fascinating than a book or other medium which has been &#8220;banned&#8221; or otherwise censored from distribution to the masses.  I hope the results of this report are less a symptom of pure curiosity and more a fierce, unabashed resistance to the multicult.</p>

		<p>Very good news indeed. Wonder if as PM the English would chicken out again and try to bar him from entering the country. Would be an interesting situation. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m telling you.  Racism is so bad that many whites are now waking up! Be ready for them with information and reasoned arguments.  Support them.</p>
<p>Knowledge, free speech and thought are the absolute enemies of the racists.  Encourage whites who are becoming aware to get as many facts as possible.  Point out that the racists want to suppress free speech and information.  Ask them why the racists do that? We on the other hand need to encourage free inquiry and learning. </p>

<p>Perhaps, but they are at least deliberately resisting an invading force which wants to destroy them. That&rsquo;s a big honkin&rsquo; start. More than I can say for American whites, midwestern or otherwise.</p>

		<p>I hope that Europeans start to celebrate their old folk customs as well as religious observances. Many Catholic countries have religious processions through the streets with bands, children dressed as angels and saints etc.  I don&rsquo;t know what the Dutch religious and traditional observances are but I hope they bring them back. Seeing these cultural customs out in the open in the streets is a way of creating a sense of unity and a link with the past.</p>

I´d say no laugh was intended. To Romanians, Vlad IS a national hero. If you look beyond Bram Stoker and at actual history, he held back the Turks for quite some time (albeit by sometimes, erm, unconventional means) until he was overwhelmed and beheaded and had his head (conserved in a jar of honey) sent to Istanbul as a trophy.<br/>
- A few years ago, my parents visited his tomb (in the Danube delta; though more as a curiosity - their main interest was in old monasteries)<br/>
The allusion to Karl Martell is fitting - or maybe to duke Heinrich II in the battle of Liegnitz (against the Golden Horde i.e. Mongols).</p>

		<p>In reply to elitist, I suggest that an important reason why the anti-immigration trend is rising more strongly in Europe than in the USA is precisely that Europe is &#8220;liberal&#8221;. There is thus a bigger gap between the very conservative values of the Third World immigrants and the liberal values of the indigenous populations.</p>
<p>Conservative Third World immigrants to the USA can gradually integrate into the conservative American culture, but in Europe, the leap from Third World values to European values is simply too big, so the immigrants remain isolated in their own ghettos. This probably means that Europe has a better chance of avoiding gradual Brazilianisation, but also that unless Third World immigration is stopped, a civil war is very likely.</p>

		<p>Squarepusher knows his history and understands my post saying some good things about Vlad the Impaler Dracula and Charles Martel - both men of action who understood what was at stake during these mass Muslim immigration invasions.</p>
<p>My post was meant to be taken with a laugh as you are correct most people in the West don&rsquo;t consider Dracula to be a modern role model for how Western leaders should act now. But, we now live in difficult times and I hope everyone who reads and posts on Amren has been shaken out of his/her comfort zone that the American libertarian, anything goes = let the market rule way of thinking and acting does not solve, address the issues involved in massive NW immigration, especially massive Muslim immigration.</p>
<p>Dracula and Charles Martel understood what was at stake - they were not idiots like way too many idiot LIbertarians, talkers, cowards, fools in American Conservative politics.</p>
