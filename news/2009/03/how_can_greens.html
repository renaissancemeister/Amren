<h1><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123751199171791061.html">How Can Greens Make Themselves Less White?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Naomi Schaefer Riley, Wall Street Journal, March 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few days after Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration, the newly appointed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, gave an interview to Essence magazine. Ms. Jackson explained that she planned to &#8220;elevate the issue&#8221; of &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; during her tenure. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, environmental justice is the sweet spot where the green movement meets the racial grievance industry. As the Essence interviewer put it: &#8220;The practice of locating polluting industries in minority communities  &mdash;  and the consequent health impacts  &mdash;  is well documented. African Americans are almost 80 percent more likely than White Americans to live in neighborhoods near hazardous industrial pollution sites.&#8221;</p>
<p>The concept of environmental justice can be traced back to the early &rsquo;80s, according to Robert Bullard, the director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University. He cites a 1982 fight over a landfill in Warren County, N.C. Since then, the movement has blamed industrial plants across the country for skyrocketing asthma rates among inner-city blacks. But Mr. Bullard believes that environmental justice should also include a concern about the lack of public parks in inner cities and high childhood obesity rates among blacks (stemming from fewer supermarkets in their neighborhoods). He refers to those fights as &#8220;parks justice&#8221; and &#8220;food justice.&#8221; Talk about defining justice down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some racial minorities apparently remain unconvinced. An article in the New York Times last week documented how green groups are having trouble attracting black and Hispanic supporters. Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, noted that at a typical Sierra Club meeting  &mdash;  despite the organization&rsquo;s best efforts  &mdash;  &#8220;the people are mostly white, largely over 40, almost all college educated, whose style is to argue with each other.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That may not be a welcoming environment.&#8221; Other green leaders quoted by the Times bemoaned their failure to draw a more rainbow-colored crowd, faulting themselves for not coming up with better outreach efforts. One diversity consultant complained that the dress code of environmental groups might be putting off minorities. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the tyranny of the fleece,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It may be mere condescension to assume that racial minorities don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s at stake in such matters  &mdash;  that it is the outreach effort that is failing and not the message itself. It could well be that minorities understand all too well. &#8220;Environmentalism doesn&rsquo;t appeal to minorities,&#8221; says Steven Milloy, the publisher of JunkScience.com, because &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t bring them anything.&#8221; He explains: &#8220;Environmentalists scare companies from building plants where people could use the jobs, and the plants go overseas instead.&#8221; In the late &rsquo;90s, for instance, the greens managed to run the Shintech company out of Convent, La., where it had planned to build a chemical plant that would have created more than 150 jobs. Though three-quarters of the black residents near the site wanted the facility, the company eventually backed out, tired of the harassment from the Clinton administration&rsquo;s EPA.</p>
<p>Driving jobs away, particularly in today&rsquo;s economy, is much more harmful to the health of racial minorities than any presumed &#8220;environmental&#8221; threat. As Mr. Milloy explains: &#8220;People who have jobs have health insurance and a higher standard of living.&#8221; As for what we might call &#8220;heat justice&#8221;: People with jobs also have more air-conditioning units, which can presumably prevent heat-related deaths.</p>

			<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to flip white environmentalists to racialism, when they finally figure out that blacks and Hispanics tend to waste resources and be insouciant about ecology, and overpopulation in Africa and South America threaten the rain forests and endangered animal species.</p>

The reason non-whites aren&rsquo;t into environmentalism is because it doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with racial grievences or spoils system.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main reason, the second reason is whatever you may think of environmentalists, it takes a long range view and requires a concern for the interests of the world, as opposed to their discrete group interests.</p>

			<p>Take a look around black and Hispanic neighborhoods. You think people who won&rsquo;t even use a garbage can care about clean lakes and rivers. Give me a break.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real hooter of a paragraph in the original story that says activists claim blacks suffer from global warming more because of &#8216;heat deaths.&rsquo; Yes, these people think human beings native to Africa are more prone to death by heat than white Europeans. </p>
<p>The severity of their delusions should be a sign of hope for us. Our opponents live a lie 24/7. How can they keep it up over time?</p>

			<p><i>He cites a 1982 fight over a landfill in Warren County, N.C.</i></p>
<p>And if that landfill moved somewhere else, who would be complaining about the <i>terminal unemployment</i> of the local &#8220;African-American&#8221; community?</p>
<p><i>Since then, the movement has blamed industrial plants across the country for skyrocketing asthma rates among inner-city blacks.</i></p>
<p>Except that the <b>majority</b> of medical academics (I suffered from asthma as a child, so I&rsquo;ve always been interested in new developments in asthma research) state that asthma is high in among inhabitants of <i>all</i> major cities - irregardless of race.</p>
<p><i>But Mr. Bullard believes that environmental justice should also include a concern about the lack of public parks in inner cities and high childhood obesity rates among blacks (stemming from fewer supermarkets in their neighborhoods).</i></p>
<p>And how often do those &#8220;public parks&#8221; become run-down, trash-ridden messes where drug deals are done in plain sight?<br>
Will he mention the fact that it&rsquo;s not that supermarkets <i>don&rsquo;t come</i> to &#8220;majority-black&#8221; neighbourhoods, it&rsquo;s that they are <i>driven out</i> by crime?</p>
<p><i>But some racial minorities apparently remain unconvinced. An article in the New York Times last week documented how green groups are having trouble attracting black and Hispanic supporters.</i></p>
<p>Can you remind us what the organ-donation rates are for &#8220;African&#8221; and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; communities in the United States? Why said minorities are less-charitable than their white counterparts on average (incomes etc included)? </p>
<p><i>Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, noted that at a typical Sierra Club meeting &mdash; despite the organization&rsquo;s best efforts &mdash; &ldquo;the people are mostly white, largely over 40, almost all college educated, whose style is to argue with each other&hellip; . That may not be a welcoming environment.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, considering that the average Third-Worlder prefers  strongmen dictatorships over democracies&hellip;</p>
<p><i><b>Though three-quarters of the black residents near the site wanted the facility</b>, the company eventually backed out, tired of the harassment from the Clinton administration&rsquo;s EPA.</i></p>
<p>Compare with:</p>
<p><i>The concept of environmental justice can be traced back to the early &rsquo;80s, according to Robert Bullard, the director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University.

<p>As I noted previously:<br>
* Industry enters &#8220;majority-black&#8221; community: Blacks get jobs, but complain about &#8220;industry-related health effects and diseases&#8221;.<br>
* Industry doesn&rsquo;t enter &#8220;majority-black&#8221; community: Blacks &#8220;healthier&#8221; but complain about &#8220;lack of opportunity/employment&#8221;.</p>

			<p>When will non-Whites be interesting in national and world ecology?  Easy answer; When they see the jobs they can get from it.  Unfortunately, that also goes for oil companies and other suppliers of electric power.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t matter what anyone does as long as we do nothing about the massively expanding third world populaitons.</p>

			<p>The green party has gone to comical lengths to try to get blacks to care about nature, running certified lunatic Cynthia McKinney to run for as their presidential candidate to no avail. Whites are the only group that seems to have this ingrained complex that we have to save the world. In my mostly hispanic neighborhood, I see everyday people just walking out of fast food joints tossing garbage on the street rather than walking an extra 2 or 3 feet to a garbage bin. Caring about things is just not something that registers in their mind.</p>
<p>I was a leftwing college activist not all that long ago, the party line was always that blacks weren&rsquo;t joining our little activist groups, not because they didn&rsquo;t care about social justice, but because the racist cops racist would simply beat them all up and throw them in jail like Mumia if they went to our little protest rallies. If only the cops weren&rsquo;t so scary the blacks would jump on our little liberal crusades. That was what we all pretended to believe anywa.</p>

			<p>Enviornmentalism doesnt appeal to blacks-unless they are playing the victim card.In Hunters Point in San Francisco,they constantly complained about all of the allegedly hazardous serpentine rock dust that was being put into the air by a construction contractor there.As a kid, I breathed in clouds of it, and it didnt harm me at all.They got their ambulance chasing Angela Alioto to persecute their case.  </p>

The radical wing of the environmental movement must have reached their saturation point with whites. They must not be growing and expanding as much as they had hoped.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a radical environmentalist to do? Try to form a coalition with other radicals.</p>
<p>Only radical blacks and Hispanics could care less about the environment unless they can get something concrete for themselves like money and affirmative action jobs. These people don&rsquo;t care about &#8216;saving the earth&rsquo;. They care about &#8216;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Environmentalists can try to coax blacks and hispanics into their movement by trying to link the environmental movement with civil and human rights issues but it&rsquo;s a big leap for blacks and hispanics. The closest they ever got was the short-lived &#8216;environmental racism&rsquo;; claiming that minorities were impacted by pollution and dumping.</p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics aren&rsquo;t concerned about the future of the earth but for themselves, here and now. Unless environmentalists can &#8216;show them the money&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a dead end issue.<br>

			<p>Civilized Neighbor hit the nail on the head: Why would blacks and hispanics who cover their homes and &#8216;hoods w/litter and graffiti give a damn about Brazilian rainforests or spotted owls being threatened?</p>
<p>Still, while self-centered non-whites care too little about the environment, our people tend to care too much about it. I&rsquo;ve read articles by European greens who swear they&rsquo;ll never have children in order to reduce global warming. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know why a group whose sole purpose is environmental protection, would want to attract Blacks or any specific racial group (or to reject them). Of course, I don&rsquo;t know why such a group would not oppose mass immigration. So, I guess that I don&rsquo;t understand these groups.</p>
<p>In any case, I have a suggestion to help these environmental groups become shadier: Announce a policy that only stiffly dressed Whites will be allowed to join. Instantly, the Blacks will pounce on you, and demand to join up, or they&rsquo;ll sue and destroy. Then you cave, and admit them. Your Diversity problem <br>
is solved.</p>

			<p>The same &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; who are pushing the &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; movement are the ones who insist that it is racist to reduce immigration so that we can stabilize our population.  I&rsquo;m pro-environment, but want nothing to do with the more-red-than-green people who lead the environmental organizations today.<br>

			<p>The only groups which have demonstrated an appreciable appreciation and concern for nature and the environment are whites and some Asians.  Therefore, as most left-wing political parties in the Western nations are further transformed into &#8220;people of color&#8221; advocacy organizations their concern for the environment will gradually disappear.  A fortaste of this trend can be found in this recent article:</p>
<p>&#8220;On the eve of the Sundance Film Festival, filmmaker Robert Redford got some very bad reviews today, not from movie critics but from black ministers. They came from around the country to attack his environmental views and to stand up in favor of oil and gas drilling.&#8221; </p>

			<p>The Sierra Club had an election several years ago on whether the Club should oppose immigration.  They voted not to oppose the drowning of the U.S. in Third Worlders, who use the recycling bins the city provides for their laundry.  The choice was Green or Red, and the Reds won.  Hatred of Whites trumped concern for the environment.</p>

			<p> Non-White populations only care about environmental initiatives as they apply to their neighborhoods in urban environments. White environmentalists on the other hand are into nature and outdoor recreation. Many non-whites are indifferent to to both of these. Some even regard nature and outdoor recreation as a potential threat to their physical safety.  This cultural divide is as wide as the Grand Canyon.</p>

			<p>Post-1965 immgrant, because of their high fertility, are a very significant threat to the environmnet. They cause 100 percent of current US population growth. They are a threat to endangeres species,water supplies,farmland&hellip;you name it.</p>
<p>One was the last time you heard someone from the Sierra Club calling far a major increase in Native Born White America fertility.</p>
<p>In fact, if you asked any libeal environmnetalist if they would advocate an increase in Native Born White fertility they would say&#8221;NO, high Native Born White Fertility would threaten the enviroment&#8221;  You see, it is all one big lie.</p>
<p>If post-1965 immgration policy is not shut down completely and a majoriy ofpost-1965 non-whites are not kicked out of America, The US population will hit the one billion mark and keep on increasing and increasing. It will be unlivable in America. Native Born White Americans will have no future. </p>

			<p>Just drive through any black neighborhood and you will notice that garbage is strewn all over the place.  Do you honestly think that people who won&rsquo;t even use a garbage can will join the environmentalist movement?  The Green Party&rsquo;s attempt to attract black members is driving away whites and making them look stupid; case in point: Cynthia McKinney.  </p>

			<p>This is something I have difficulty understanding. When I see the beauty of the natural or man-made world defaced by litter, graffiti, or other such things, it is as disruptive to my well-being as being punched in the stomach. When I read about the loss of habitats or species we may never be able to bring back, I am touched by a sadness not altogether unlike that felt at a personal loss, such as of a beloved pet or even of a friend or relative.</p>
<p>I accept that some people place no value on these things, but I cannot imagine what it would be like to be one of those people. How can someone not only not be bothered by this sort of destruction, but actually carry it out, and even enjoy it? Perhaps the attitude is a product of learning, but my own attitude at least has been constant throughout my life.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that more than anything else drove me to oppose Third World immigration, it is the ecological and social consequences of gross overpopulation, which we are supporting by providing a safety valve to overpopulated Third World countries. True environmentalists are natural allies of the defenders of Western civilization, and not of those who welcome the invading hordes who would destroy it, and then wonder why their new homelands had become indistinguishable from the places they left behind.</p>

			<p>If you folks want to speed up the complete shutdown of post-1965 immigration, say things like :&#8221;high fertilty post-1965 immigrants because of their very high fertility are the most signficant threat to the environment&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you state this obvious fact in fact in public, the immigration enthusiast will go nuts and attack US&hellip;.and in the process&hellip;give White Nationalism free publicity.</p>
<p>And when they attack us publicly respond:&#8221; Immigration enthusiast, are you in favor of Native Born White Americans having large families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you imagine what would have happened if Jared Taylor had said this on the two Phil Donahue MSNBC shows he appeared on back in 2001. It would have opened up many more Native Born White Americans about  the really  nasty intentions that post-1965 non-whites and the liberal-left supporters have towards US. This would open up many more Native Born White Americans to the idea of White Nationalism. White Nationalism is the only defense against a political movement dedicated to the complete racial and economic dispossession of Native Born White Americans within the borders of America. </p>

			<p>The environmentalist movement in the United States had its origins with Whites, e.g., John Muir and elites such as Teddy Roosevelt. We look at environmentalism as a regular part of politics, but it really has been a a rare event in history. I also suspect that it is related to having the kind of economic surplus created by modern White civilization, since this allows for a certain conservation of resources and of national parks and such. </p>

			<p>There is a split between left &amp; right in the US:</p>
<p>the left is pro environment &amp; pro immigration, the right is against both (more or less).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s split the difference: <br>
protect the environment, <br>
put Americans to work switching to a post-oil economy, hence cutting the legs out from under Islamic terorism (their $$ is all from oil), <br>
end immigration for the most part, <br>
stop subsidizing births among low IQers, <br>
lower the US population to where it was in ca. 1980, <br>
and raise our kids to think of their nation&rsquo;s coastlines, &amp; rivers, mountains &amp; forests as a sacred trust, not a garbage can.</p>
<p>Turn off their PCs and show them how food is grown, furniture is made, houses are built. </p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t there political party out there that can stand for all these things at the same time??</p>
<p>Ditto for Europe??</p>

As  has been said  here in numerous other discussions, blacks lack a concern for future time but tend to live for today.<br>
Collectively, they have very little sense either of future or of history.  <br>
They want what they want, and they want it NOW.<br>
People who don&rsquo;t plan for themselves a year ahead are not going to plan for others a century ahead.</p>

			<p>I do not even know where to start with this one. I grew up in a neighborhood that was in close proximity to refineries and chemical plants and before the many pollution control innovations came in the late 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s many kids in the area were sick constantly with respiratory problems. While researching the area I came across an article about a black neighborhood that was just about as close as many of the homes of white friends that I had. The blacks had complained enough that they were allowed buyouts of their homes of had their homes moved out of the area. No white families had the option. To read the article you would get the idea that Mossville Louisiana was a bucholic little town in the middle of nowhere. Nothing could be further from the truth. Mossville is a neighborhood of Westlake, it is not an independant town with a police force, school system ect. In fact I had never heard of the area until I read the article. To top it all off, a photoshopped picture was placed at the head of the article showing a black man in a cemetary with refinery flares pouring black smoke. I can honestly say that the picture was doctored since the cemetary pictured is miles away in neighboring Sulphur and no refinery flare can be seen from its grounds. </p>

			<p>   The root cause of environmental degradation, according to the late Jacques Cousteau, was overpopulation. Most population growth in developed countries is driven by immigration from Third World countries. Because the immigrants are frequently black and brown, most so-called &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; can&rsquo;t bring themselves to publically oppose it. Their fear of being accused of racism is combined with their liberal ideology of multiculturalism/diversity. This has led to a phony and ineffectual type of environmentalism. Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221; for this self defeating attitude is the Sierra Club.  </p>
<p>&#8220;True environmentalists are natural allies of the defenders of Western civilization, and not of those who welcome the invading hordes who would destroy it, and then wonder why their new homelands had become indistinguishable from the places they left behind.&#8221;  True enough!<br>

			<p>Poverty, not,race is the reason blacks live near pollution sources. Black success stories don&rsquo;t live with their bros and sistas, they live in their mansions next to &#8221; Whitey &#8220;; why are black successful people not called on this issue ?</p>

In the case of the Sierra Club, it&rsquo;s quite uncomplicated.  They were just simply bought off with a huge  contribution from a certain billionaire whose grandfather was an immigrant and whose wife is a Mexican. Case closed.  Since then, they&rsquo;ve been deafeningly silent on the subject of immigration.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Why isn&rsquo;t there political party out there that can stand for all these things at the same time??&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been saying for years now that Republicans need to reorganize under the CONSERVEative label.  Protecting our natural resources, preserving our standard of living, and eliminating our dependence on foreign oil are all conservative values.  How disappointed I was when the R&rsquo;s new chairperson decided that the party&rsquo;s biggest problem is that it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; enough.</p>
<p>I once heard a &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; artist say &#8220;Old white men are conservative because they have something to conserve.&#8221;  Far from feeling shamed, as he probably intended, I felt proud.  It&rsquo;s about time that white people woke up and realized that we DO have something to conserve, and we need to do something before it disappears.</p>
<p>&#8220;The root cause of environmental degradation, according to the late Jacques Cousteau, was overpopulation. Most population growth in developed countries is driven by immigration from Third World countries. Because the immigrants are frequently black and brown, most so-called &ldquo;environmentalists&rdquo; can&rsquo;t bring themselves to publically oppose it.

<p>It is the very nature of liberalism that causes this movement to be completely ineffectual.  The fatal flaw in the Zero Population Growth movement and the modern Environmental movement is that they rely on VOLUNTARY compliance!  To rely on altruism when a billion years of the history of life on Earth proves that every organism from amoebas on up is COMPETITIVE!</p>
<p>In a world of competition, the altruistic self-sacrificing organism will die.  That is what white liberals want us to become.  It is only through criminalizing pollution, ending immigration, and cutting off support to the third world that the planet can be saved.</p>

<p>They do care about the environment. You think whites, along the West Coast, are responsible for all the plastic gathering way out in the pacific ocean? HaHa</p>
<p>Cities are toxic, but I&rsquo;m sure this &#8216;research&rsquo; was done in the first place with the goal of finding a way to &#8216;prove&rsquo; minorities are dumped on. Isn&rsquo;t that pretty much &#8216;science&rsquo; nowadays? Is there any other kind of social science? That much is a given, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>I am very interested in environmental issues.  I don&rsquo;t think that there is any harm in enviromentalists reproducing because environmentalists will do so in a responsible manner and teach our children to take care of things.  Piggy people who trash their own neighborhoods and have no concern for the planet should not be allowed to reproduce.  </p>
<p>If you rob, you lose your right to live in freedom.  If you drive like an idiot, you lose your license to drive.  If you treat your environment like a pig pen, you lose your right to bring your flesh and blood to raise in the pig pen.  </p>

			<p>Non abuse of animals don&rsquo;t appeal to nonwhites either&hellip;</p>
<p>I have seen and read case after case of what these nonwhites do to our animals. Has anyone ever heard of a no-kill shelter run by blacks or any other minority?  Maybe that is a good thing.I distrust and dislike veteranarians and the ASACP who have blacks and assorted minorities on their staffs also. If they are so insensitive to our animals what can we expect from them concerning the enviornment or much of anything else?</p>

			<p>In a Nationally televised debate about the environmental-ecological consequences of post-1965 immigration alwas point out that Native Born White Americans brought their fertlity level down to replacement level in 1973. And for doing the right thing for the environmnet- supposedly- Native Born White Americans are being severely punished by Liberal and Left environmnetal organizations. In response to the drop in Native Born White fetility level, Liberals and Left enviromental oganizations have lobbied for importing high fertlity post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims,carribeans and africans. That is to say, these so called environmental organizations have been cheerleaders of out of control population growth. They have been cheerleaders an imigration policy that is punishing to Native Born White Americans in three major ways:1)post-1965 immigration policy will very likely result in one billion human beings withn the borders of America(and it wont stop at a billion because of enormous demographic momentum);2)post 1965 immigration polcy will reduce Native Born Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority withn the borders of America and as a consequence fce brutal discrimination;3)post-1965 immigration will create- over a time- a very low wage labor economy for Native Born White Americans(wage slavery). Or to put it another way, Liberal-Left enviromental otganizations are waging a race war against Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans do the right thing for the environment-lowering their fertility to replacement level-FOR 37 YEARS!!!-and get punished for doing this at the same time&hellip;the rational thing for Native Born White Americans to do is increase their fetility and live it up&hellip;screw the environment. What would be the incentive for doing the right thing for the environment if it results in severe punishment. Clearly, the liberal-left envronmentalist are advocating an irrational environmental policy.</p>
<p>Every White Nationalist who goes on mainstream tv should memorize the contents of this post. It goes right to the heart of the issue.</p>

			<p>Come to south Texas and see how concerned Hispanics are about a clean environment.  Trash everywhere, constantly blowing trash.   Parking lots are filled with trash from merchandise wrappers to used diapers, and of course, empty oil bottles.</p>
<p>Trash and more trash.  Come to Padre Island and watch the trash blow.</p>
<p>These people couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>

			<p>do or die</p>
<p>The Reublican can never come out against post-1965 immigration policy and be pro-environment-ecology. The Republican party is owned by powerfull corporations. The corporations want foreign scab labor. The corporations are forcing force Native Born White Americans to compete in a global labor pool. The Corporations want weak and defenseless wage slaves. Corporations are psychopathic entities that hate the very concept of community. The Republican party is the political arm of these psychopathic entities.</p>
<p>This is why it is monumentally foolish of Peter Brimelow and Steve Sailer to try and save the Republican party. The only alternative to the anti-white Republican party is a raced-based political movement. This is essentially what White Nationalism is all about. How  conservatism ever get conflated with worshipping THE CORPORATION is a mystery to me.</p>
<p>Any Republican politician who receives $$$$$$$ from the corporations is a traitor.</p>
<p>The ideal pro-white politician would be someone who is socially conservative, anti-immigrant and holds the foriegn policy and anticorporatist views of Ralp Nader and Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>Conservatism should no longer be conflated with war mongering and  worshipping of the corporation.</p>
<p>Let the Republican go the grave as soon as possible.</p>

<p>How true! I once worked with a large dog breed rescue organization composed of animal shelter workers and volunteers. We had an e-mail group connecting us all, nationwide.  </p>
<p>Years before the Michael Vick outrage, one deluded liberal in the group asked why we didn&rsquo;t have any black members. NO ONE responded to her because most of us [who&rsquo;d seen what many non-whites had done to animals] knew we didn&rsquo;t want them on-board. </p>
<p>Finally, I posted: &#8220;You REALLY don&rsquo;t want that&hellip;&#8221;  She still didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
