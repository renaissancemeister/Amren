<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Lakeview Elementary parent is upset the audience of a school program on Martin Luther King Jr. was asked to stand for a song known as the black national anthem.</p>
<p>Two teachers performed the song, &#8220;Lift Ev&rsquo;ry Voice and Sing&#8221;  &mdash;  known to some as the &#8220;Black National Anthem&#8221;  &mdash;  as part of a 15-minute program during Black History Month.</p>
<p>Russ Roberts, who has a first-grade daughter and fourth-grade son at Lakeview, said he was shocked when the audience was asked to stand for the song after it was identified as the &#8220;Black National Anthem.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he doesn&rsquo;t object to the song, but the way it was presented gave the mistaken impression to students that there are two national anthems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a letter responding to his concerns, Principal Sudie Bock said the teachers intended to show respect for the historical journey and contributions of African Americans in United States history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The program was the culmination of learning more about African Americans who have contributed to society, culture and the strength of the nation, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do that every day in our curriculum,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want our kids to see themselves and how we work together.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When I was in middle school, that being 6th through 8th grade, the American National Anthem played over the loudspeakers every morning, and virtually everyone stood up for it.  During the month of February, the Black National Anthem played after the American.  Just out of pure respect and common decency, I didn&rsquo;t sit down during the Black National Anthem, but I didn&rsquo;t have my hand up to my heart, either.</p>

<p>White cowardice displayed by catering to blacks any way possible is shameful and embarrassing to those of us who aren&rsquo;t cowards, and who don&rsquo;t try to placate undeserving blacks.</p>
<p>This ignorant woman thinks she&rsquo;s doing something that will mellow out blacks, too simple-minded to understand she only makes them worse.</p>
<p>But I have no objection to a black national anthem, or anything else they want to create that will make them separate from us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Separate but equal&#8221; received the most votes in a poll taken a few years ago by teens.  </p>
<p>It was dramatically amazing since these kids today are completely brainwashed and inundated with pro-black nonsense. Too, how many of them lied and did not admit they prefer separation?  I&rsquo;m guessing quite a lot. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m further guessing the integration the blacks and multicults value so highly to allow the races to get to know each other, and therefore cause intergroup animosities to fade away, gave the white kids, who wouldn&rsquo;t have known otherwise, a shocking example of just what blacks are like, and they want no part of them.</p>

			<p>Honestly if they want their own Anthem they can have it. It&rsquo;s plainly obvious that we are a separate people and no ideology can unite us. Making our division official will get peoples&rsquo; heads out of the sand.</p>

The Star Spangled Banner commemorates the victory of America and all Americans over enemy forces. It&rsquo;s not about race.</p>
<p>That blacks would insist on a black-themed anthem is selfish, self-centered, exclusionary, and divisive.</p>
<p>If blacks want a black national anthem, let them start their own nation. They have my support and blessing to then do anything they want for themselves.</p>

			<p>I am so sick of hearing all these excuses being made as to why &#8220;others&#8221; in this country get all the accolades!  I have not seen where &#8220;they&#8221; have done much of anything good for OUR country but I have seen the destruction they have caused OUR country. When will the truths be told for once? Never?</p>

			<p>     For God&rsquo;s sake, get your children out of the hellhole known as public schools.I taught for thirty years and I packed it in in 1994 when I saw what was coming down the road. I now attend every Board of Education meeting in my new state and I give them hell whenever they start spouting nonsense about &rsquo; self-esteem &rsquo; and the like. Go to board meetings, make a pain out of yourself, and let them know that you will expose and not stand for the garbage that is now being fed to today&rsquo;s children. If you don&rsquo;t, you have nobody to blame but yourself.</p>

			<p>It gets crazier and crazier all the time.  Does anyone realistically expect things to get better?  They are getting worse all the time, and the pace will accelerate under Obama.  A National Anthem for Blacks?? Nuts. Just plain crazy. When they leave and get their own country then they can have their own anthem.  Just wait for the future.  Whites will truly be a hated and hunted minority.</p>

			<p>Yeh, we got two national anthems in Canada too!</p>
<p>One in English and one in French.  Actually it is the same but sung in each language.</p>
<p>Best is for Quebec to separate.</p>
<p>Methinks that whites are in big big trouble now in the good old USA.</p>

			<p>I have an idea, blacks don&rsquo;t stand for the Star-spangled banner and whites don&rsquo;t stand for the &#8220;black national anthem&#8221;. As a separatist I view it as another brick in the wall to finally achieving separation.</p>

			<p>America has ONE national anthem, and if they don&rsquo;t like it thay can get over it or leave, and personally I&rsquo;d prefer they did the later. No other country that I know of has two national anthems, for people of two different colors. This is the height of stupidity and should not be tolerated, and certainly not taught to our young.   </p>

			<p>The only solace to black rule right now is that in the run they will lose to the Mexicans.  And judging by their governing in Mexico, we real Americans will dispatch them quickly over the border.</p>

			<p>Black national anthem,black national youth,sounds like the begining of a movement within our schools payed for by tax payers and reinforced by the state.Where have I seen this before historically.How about NAZIS Germany, remember no one could question the state.This is nothing more than a black nazis movement allowed by &#8220;us&#8221; and the government.Where is the outrage,where is the protest?Who has taken to the street to voice concern?Civil disobedience and we need to lift our voices to be heard.We need Lawyers to get permits for lawful protest and people willing to take this country back one battle at a time!</p>

			<p>Yes, I remember that in high school, 30 some-odd years ago, they taught us that everyone was equal.  We had one half-black student in the whole school.  Then once out in the real world, I worked in a large doctors&rsquo; office.  They had hired two blacks, the first one got the second one in.  One was stealing money for coke, as she was handling  money in the x-ray department.  Her husband was in prison.  All their conversations, all the time, were nothing but gossip that included how they knew girls who had been given grants to go to school and were sent the money directly, only to go on a big shopping spree instead.   </p>

			<p>There is no slavery in the U.S. It ended some one and half century ago. Yet when you watch the video (availavle with the original article) and listen to the song, it gives you a clear impression that those depicted on it are ready to fight with their fists against what they perceive as the main obstacle to their freedom and well-being: whites. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter to them that they enjoy, collectively, the highest living standards that any black population attained in any country on Earth.</p>
<p>It seems obvious that they are going to continue their adversarial, if not outright hostile, position towards whites regardless of the amount of goodwill and privileges that are given to them. And if they apear so militant and agitated now, imagine what can they do when whites become a minority and lose political power to today&rsquo;s minorities.</p>
<p>One must be blind (or brainwashed) to not see what is comming in America&rsquo;s future. We better do something about this before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			<p>There are actually TWO national anthems in Canada. Such is the extent of the language divide many Canadians do not even realize this. The French version is very ethnocentric including lines like &#8220;land of our ancestors&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;carry the sword&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;carry the cross&#8221;..&#8221;protect our homes and rights&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The approved English version is totally different and is essentially meaningless. Their was ONCE an English anthem that was as ethnic-based as the French one - THE MAPLE LEAF FOREVER - It included strong lines like.. &#8220;From Britain&rsquo;s shore, Wolfe, the dauntless hero came, and planted firm Britannia&rsquo;s flag&#8221;&hellip; This was seen as &#8220;exclusionary&#8221; to Francopones and the current English language &#8220;O Canada&#8221; is now used. The Francophones got to keep their anthem anyways. Only the English speakers had to abandon theirs. Not content with this the Francophones now have a Quebec anthem. Anyone who is interested should read Peter Brimelow&rsquo;s THE PATRIOT GAME. The book has a lot of answers for what went wrong in the English-speaking world. </p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t they just save some time, come together, and call their anthem the, &#8220;We are oppressed and hate whitey&#8221;?  Sounds like that&rsquo;s what they really are saying in their songs.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The program was the culmination of learning more about African Americans who have contributed to society, culture and the strength of the nation, she said.&#8221; No&hellip;. they haven&rsquo;t contributed anything other than more fatherless children on the welfare rolls. Strength of the nation? As a military member, my observation is that they occupy the majority of combat service support jobs because they are too cowardly to serve in combat arms positions. Better to serve our nation as active duty military welfare recipients who claim racism every time they are required to work.</p>
