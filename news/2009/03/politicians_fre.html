<h1>Politicians Fret as Muslim Population Swells in Europe Amid Little Integration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Burke, FOXNews, March 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Old Europe&rsquo;s population is dwindling even as immigration and high birth rates among Muslim groups are swelling in cities all over the continent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Filip Dewinter, a leader of the far-right separatist party Vlaams Belang, predicts there will eventually be a kind of civil war when the longtime residents of Brussels  &mdash;  the nation&rsquo;s capital and administrative seat of the European Union  &mdash;  realize their city is about to be taken over by Muslim immigrants.</p>
<p>Although there are no official statistics on how many Muslims live in Brussels, it is believed they make up about 25 percent of the city&rsquo;s 1 million urban residents. Dewinter, who opposes immigration and has called Islamophobia a &#8220;duty,&#8221; claims three of the 19 sections of Brussels, each with its own mayor, now have Muslim majorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In those neighborhoods it&rsquo;s not our government that&rsquo;s in power,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the Muslim authorities  &mdash;  the mosques, the imams  &mdash;  who are in charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>FOX News visited one of those neighborhoods, called Molenbeek, which looks more like North Africa than the heart of Europe.</p>
<p>For some Belgians, that&rsquo;s not a problem. The mayor of Molenbeek, Socialist Philippe Moureaux, has worked hard to help Muslims try to integrate over the past decade and a half.</p>
<p>Moureaux believes multiculturalism is a good thing. He says even those who disagree with him should get used to life as it is in Brussels today: &#8220;Be realistic. They&rsquo;re here. They&rsquo;re relatively numerous and they&rsquo;re growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Moroccans have been in Belgium for decades and are now citizens, as are their children. The imam of one of the main mosques, which thousands of young Moroccans attend each Friday, stressed that Muslim immigrants have starting blending in around Brussels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Part of that fear stems from particularly nasty street crime, something that can happen in bad neighborhoods in any big European  &mdash;  or American  &mdash;  city. But part of it is due to strong anti-Western sentiment among Belgium&rsquo;s Muslims, which suggests that true integration is still a long way off.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for Dewinter, integration simply isn&rsquo;t working. He claims the great majority of the Muslims don&rsquo;t want it to work. So instead of being a melting pot, Brussels has become a city that does everything possible to appease Islam, he claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halal food is served in the schools, not only for Muslim children, but for all the children,&#8221; said Dewinter, adding that municipal pools in Brussels now have separate hours for men and women to swim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though the immigration debate has not yet reached the fever pitch it has in the U.S., a real test will come when a major European city has a Muslim majority. The first could be Marseilles, in France, or Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. But don&rsquo;t count out Brussels, the heart and capital of Europe.<br>

			<p>When one of these European cities becomes majority Muslim, the power that shifts to them will not initially be used in any dramatic form that might alarm the white liberals.  Muslims will move slowly, soothe any fears, but work in the background to consolidate and spread their influence.  It is only when they gain sufficient control over an entire nation that the uprising against Europeans will begin in earnest.  At that point, without outside help, the Europeans will not be able to stop them from opening the floodgates of Muslim immigration.  Which country will be the breach in the dike?</p>

			<p>It was the Francophone Belgians (the Walloons) who are most responsible for this. They wanted to flood the Flemish part of Belgium with non-White ethnics who could speak some French. Such a shortsighted policy.</p>

			<p>A few days ago, I read where a British official said that Britain is &#8220;on the brink,&#8221; referring to the vilence in danger of coming from the huge islamic, black, and third world populations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that could be explained in detail that would give a clearer picture than that statement.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck also had a British Daniel (somebody) on that said the country is in much worse shape than the US.  That assessment, however, has been repeated often by so many private experts it is very well known.</p>
<p>The whole of the old Eastern iron curtain countries are ready to go down, as is Ireland.  Iceland has already collapsed.</p>
<p>The economists Peter Schiff, Neill Ferguson, and Roubini are saying that the collapse of these countries just in themselves will cause a global economic meltdown.</p>
<p>All of it is quite different than what the MSM, govt. officials, are telling us, including Bernanke, which is that we can expect a &#8220;turnaround&#8221; by the end of this year. Since that information is in sharp contrast to so many other analysis, I think anybody claiming that should be criminally charged everytime their predicted date comes and goes and we find out they were lying all along.</p>

			<p>This story will certainly depress many Amren readers, but there are great opportunities for us with this issue.</p>
<p>I have found that the Muslim immigration invasion issue is the one that cuts through all the multi cult propaganda and tends to reach the hearts and souls of 90% plus White Western people. It simply is impossible to make dark, hairy looking Jihadists who stone women to death, wear masks and threaten to cut off the heads of infidels - it&rsquo;s impossible to make these &#8220;other people&#8221; look cute and part of some idealized rainbow co-alition of progressives, maybe a few arch Conservative Jew haters might try to network with these folks but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>The best thing about these NW Muslim immigrant invaders is that they can usually be counted on to provide great video and photo ops for us as they fall for the most predictably propaganda traps.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go for this easy way, the free throw and hammer home the issue that &#8220;We&#8221; are threatened by &#8220;Them&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8221; need to get together and save &#8220;our&#8221; people from &#8220;those&#8221; &#8220;other&#8221; people.</p>
<p>Here is an excellent video showing the dangers of EU/Canadian Style Hate Crime Laws that get used by Muslims to persecute and intimidate White Western people.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll not get into quibbling over which is the greater threat.  But neither one is the greatest threat.<br>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not working, it never has. Take one walk around these European capitals and it is strikingly obvious to anyone with half a brain and not in denial enough due to their leftist-educational upbringing to admit it. It doesn&rsquo;t take any sort of gift or special ability to figure out how it&rsquo;s going to end. </p>

I have to respectfully disagree.  I believe leftists are the most dangerous people on the planet.  The folks you mention are what they are, but they are enabled by the left.<br>

			<p>Look at the continent of Africa and then compare the size of Europe to it. Africa is many times bigger. The biggest European country is about the size of Texas. It makes absolutely no sense to flood these tiny European countries with people from all over the world. </p>

<p>Why are the Western nations acting like they want this conflict to bring them down?</p>
<p>Is it just multiculturalism gone haywire?</p>
<p>Or is is a &#8220;Phoenix&#8221; scenario they&rsquo;re looking for? </p>

			<p>I have been to Brussels and Amsterdam in the past year and there is absolutely no feeling that you are in a white country.  The Belgians warn you not to go anywhere near the DRC&rsquo;s (Democratic Republic of Congo). In Amsterdam every single black person you see offers you &#8220;coke, ecstasy, viagra&#8221;.   Meanwhile the EU is busy passing every anti-racism law they can think of to intimidate/imprison any reasonable thinking person. (anti-racism towards non-whites that is; is there any other kind of racism?) Even in a city like Vienna, if you take the subway you&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;re in Istanbul.  In Rome you can walk for half an hour in some parts of the city and not see a single Italian person. In Rome a guy was trying to sell me an umbrella on the street for 2 euros and I asked him where he was from and he said Bangladesh. I asked him why he moved to Italy and he said because he can make more money in Italy than in Bangladesh.  How much money can you make selling umbrellas for 2 euros? It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>

<p>I must respectfully counter-disagree. All of the leftists can be bought off or bribed, evidence of this abounds, the muslims CANNOT and are prepared to kill all of those (us) that do not convert.</p>

<p>I agree with SKIP 100%. As an expat in Germany from a predominantly Muslim country (Turkey), a sizable portion is not religious although they are considered as Muslims.</p>
<p>But those who are flooding Europe to build their enclaves are poor, inherently hostile and -as SKIP said- can&rsquo;t be bought off (may be cut off?!), especially the groups that are funded by primarily Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Some people on AmRen would disagree with me but the American presence in the Middle East could have accelerated Muslim immigration and breeding to/in Europe. </p>
<p>If the Europeans want to have a future, Turkey should NEVER become a FULL member of the EU. The US and the UK should reconsider their support to Turkey and bear in mind that a membership would shift European borders towards Armenia, Iran, Iraq and Syria which have nothing but predominantly poor and MUSLIM (Exception: Armenia) populations.</p>
<p>Be sure that millions are awaiting a Turkish membership to the EU to join their &#8220;relatives&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The left are &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; for the financial elites.  </p>
<p>They provide the foot-soldiers and political support for mass immigration and multiculturalism, unaware that they are doing the work of the elites, who want to see Western civilization fractured, divided, and harnessed to a globalized economy of slaves. </p>

			<p>Perhaps America is partly (if unwittingly) to blame for this. For sixty years we let western Europe shelter under our nuclear umbrella and NATO. We never made Europe do its fair share of spending on defense. Never demanded Europe assert its role in world affairs. At the height of the cold war America spent more money defending Europe then EUROPE spent defending Europe. Thus Europe was free to indulge in socialism and welfare. This made Europeans soft and tenants of a &#8216;Nanny-state&rsquo;. It also attracted the third world riff-raff too. A really good book was written by a Frenchman some years back criticizing his fellow Europeans about its free-ride on America&rsquo;s military and diplomatic coattails. It was called IN DEFENSE OF DECADENT EUROPE.</p>

			<p>I must disagree with Dewinter, about the &#8220;civil war&#8221; in Belgium. How can there be a civil war if the government has disarmed its subjects?</p>
