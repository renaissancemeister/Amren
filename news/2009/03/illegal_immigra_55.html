<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/employment/2009-03-08-immigrant-jobs_N.htm">Illegal Immigrants Might Get Stimulus Jobs, Experts Say</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William M. Welch, USA Today, March 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tens of thousands of jobs created by the economic stimulus law could end up filled by illegal immigrants, particularly in big states such as California where undocumented workers are heavily represented in construction, experts on both sides of the issue say.</p>
<p>Studies by two conservative think tanks estimate immigrants in the United States illegally could take 300,000 construction jobs, or 15% of the 2 million jobs that new taxpayer-financed projects are predicted to create.</p>
<p>They fault Congress for failing to require that employers certify legal immigration status of workers before hiring by using a Department of Homeland Security program called E-Verify. The program allows employers to check the validity of Social Security numbers provided by new hires. It is available to employers on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said a federal requirement that employers use E-Verify would have reduced, if not eliminated, the hiring of immigrants in this country illegally.</p>
<p>An advocacy group for immigrants, illegal and legal, did not disagree with the 300,000 estimate. Camarota says the estimate is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey and other independent findings that 15% of all construction workers in the USA are either illegal immigrants or lack the status of legal immigrant authorized to work.</p>
<p>But Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of education for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, said it is impossible to predict with certainty because it is unknown how many jobless immigrant construction workers may leave the U.S., frustrated by the economic recession, before the new spending produces jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A similar hiring estimate was produced in a report in February by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Senior research fellow Robert Rector wrote, &#8220;Without specific mechanisms to ensure that workers are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants authorized to work, it is likely that 15% of these workers, or 300,000, would be illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The version of the stimulus bill passed by the House of Representatives included a provision requiring employers to check immigration status with the E-Verify system before hiring. The Senate did not include such a provision, and it was not in the version sent to President Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>The business groups and immigrant advocacy groups argue that the E-Verify database is riddled with errors that could result in millions of workers being wrongly identified as not authorized for work. They say requiring its use before hiring would impose a cost burden on employers and open them to lawsuits.</p>

		<p>If anyone needs a clear, concise and incontrovertible example of how our government puts the welfare of illegal aliens ahead of its own citizens, here you have it!  </p>
<p>Memorize the facts and the source.  Next time you&rsquo;re talking to your idiot relative/neighbor/coworker who thinks the government is trying to help working Americans, tell them about this outrage.  If they are too dense to figure out the implications of how &amp; why Congress left E-Verify out of the Stimulus Bill, they are not worth talking to.  </p>

I was watching Washington Journal on c-span this morning. A very angry black women from Dallas called in to complain about hispanics.</p>
<p>She said they did shoddy work and that wherever they worked, second crews had to be brought in to clean up their projects.</p>
<p>She said she believes all the stimulus money is going to go to hispanics. And as I said, she was very angry about it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Senate Democrats remove E-verify etc&hellip;.&rdquo;  And yet many, many whites will still vote democratic. I&rsquo;m beginning to think that the most dangerous thing in our society is a White person in a  voting booth.</p>

		<p>How much of a &#8220;stimulus&#8221; to the economy is giving cash to illegals?  They send that money directly home as remittances, after all, and it thus immediately leaves the US economy.</p>

		<p>I was at the mall yesterday and saw two white teenagers passing by. They look like they had fallen out of a dumpster. I stared at them and one of them asked me why. I wanted to know why they dressed the way they did. I asked them if they were a boss of a company and someone dressed like they were came for an interview, would he hire them ? Their answer staggered me: &#8221; Why bother, the minorities get all the good jobs anyway.&#8221;</p>
