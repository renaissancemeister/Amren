<h1>Pelosi Tells Illegal Immigrants That Work Site Raids Are Un-American</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Lajeunesse, FOXNews, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told a group of both legal and illegal immigrants and their families that enforcement of existing immigration laws, as currently practiced, is &#8220;un-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker, condemning raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, referred to the immigrants she was addressing as &#8220;very, very patriotic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in this country would not want to change a policy of kicking in doors in the middle of the night and sending a parent away from their families?&#8221; Pelosi told a mostly Hispanic gathering at St. Anthony&rsquo;s Church in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be stopped.&mbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.What value system is that? I think it&rsquo;s un-American. I think it&rsquo;s un-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelosi said she was invited to the church by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., as part of his 17-city, cross-country tour called United Families, which he says is intended to put a human face on the immigration debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Referring to work site enforcement actions by ICE agents, Pelosi said, &#8220;We have to have a change in policy and practice and again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&rsquo;t say enough, the raids must end. The raids must end.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>  Of course, they are patriotic, TO MEXICO!!! That stupid wind-bag is typical of what&rsquo;s wrong with America. She should have to live with those &#8220;patriotic&#8221; people, right in the middle of a known gang of them. Anything  for a vote. Pelosi has already made the pope mad, she might as well make us mad as well. Our immigration laws are meant to be enforced, that&rsquo;s why they are laws. If you care to see something un-American, look to Washington D.C. With a few exceptions, the  vast majority in Congress and the idiot in the White House are as un-American as it gets. Without some divine intervention, we are headed towards collapse.</p>

			<p>George Orwell once wrote that some animals are more equal than others.  Speaker Pelosi is opposed to ICE enforcing immigration law by means of mass raids of workplaces, but what would she think if a white person in Idaho failed to pay the $5 transfer tax on a sawed-off shotgun that was 0.25 inch over the limit, and the FBI rides in cowboy and kills the man&rsquo;s wife, infant child and dog?  Would Speaker Pelosi haul it up to Idaho and denounce &#8220;kicking in doors&#8221; by the FBI robbing a man of his wife, child and dog?</p>

			<p> Speaking from California, no less. Isn&rsquo;t California overrun with Mexicans? She obviously feels more secure sucking up to the hispanic lobby than to the concerns and worries of plain Americans. What kind of country is she going to leave her grandchildren? Unless she really believes that bile, &#8220;can&rsquo;t we learn to live together&#8221;? The answer to that question is &#8220;no&#8221;. Take a look at the shrinking percentage of white people in that state. That will tell you.</p>

			<p>Here we go with Pelosi again. Just a few random thoughts. First, I don&rsquo;t for a minute believe that altruism or feelings of sympathy for the poor illegal aliens is a concern of hers. I also don&rsquo;t believe she is concerned about &#8220;families&#8221;. She is certainly not concerned about America&rsquo;s poor citizens or their families. No, Ms.Nancy and her political ilk, are concerned that they please those they have sold out to. In her case the Chamber of Commerce, powerfull ethnic interest groups,(only powerfull ones),and open borders groups in general. We know this, because we have seen her pandering to these groups. </p>
<p>American citizens and legal residents, are her very last concern. As long as they shut their mouths, don&rsquo;t stir up any trouble and pay their taxes, she is fine with them. But then, when it comes to illegal immigration and the &#8220;patriotic&#8221; illegal aliens, the majority of democrats can be counted on to sell out the American citizenry, you know, those people who have paid the taxes, fought the wars and followed the laws. My God, without being too judgemental, it&rsquo;s clear this woman is the poster child for what is wrong with &#8220;American&#8221; politicians.</p>

			<p>A correction will be acceptable, of course, but am I right in dimly remembering from this site or possibly the *vdare* website that Nancy and/or her husband have the sort of commercial interests in which seasonal low-wage labor - immigrant labor - is employed?</p>

			<p>Damn right illegal immigrants are patriotic. They&rsquo;re waving that Mexican flag in our faces every opportunity. While stealing over $140 billion from our economy ($90 billion in taxpayer funded hand-out and freebies&hellip; and another $50 billion sent SOUTH  usually a one-way trip). As to the amount of CRIMES by illegals&hellip; that&rsquo;s another story. </p>

<p>When her policies cause food riots and tax revolts, plus ethnic fighting, I can tell you right now she&rsquo;ll blame the opposing political party.</p>

			<p>This type of idiocy has caused Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hesitate from staging several important workplace raids. The soft line on immigration enforcement is affecting the agents in the trenches. </p>

			<p>I can only think of one plausible explanation for the actions of politicians like Pelosi.</p>
<p>They are brainwashed and like members of a cult.  They have been exposed to certain types of thoughts and philosophies and actually believe what they are spouting.</p>
<p>As with any person that has been victimized by a cult, they need to be deprogramed or reprogramed.</p>
<p>Either that or the extra terrestrial aliens have taken over her brain and the most of the congress and senate not only here but in all other western white nations.</p>
<p>There just cannot be any other explanation for the policies that are leading to hers, her childrens and our destruction.  It cannot be just money and greed.  Even a fool will understand that to be rich in a ghetto is not really all that great.</p>

			<p>Nancy Pelozi is worse than Hillary Clinton. She is totally out of control. I saw the clip on cable news&hellip;.she was talking to a church full of illegal aliens and kept using the phrase &#8220;our country&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>It is NOT their country. It is MY COUNTRY and nobody can have it simply by entering the country illegally. This is MY COUNTRY. They have a country&hellip;.and they need to return to it. Mine is not for the taking.</p>
<p>Nancy needs to be told that being a TRAITOR is UnAmerican&hellip;. enforcing the immigration law is not UnAmerican.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s blindingly obvious that the cosy two-party political system means politicians are in thrall to various immigrant groups even if their policies are disastrous for the country as a whole. Politicians like Pelosi are nothing but bought-and-sold self-interested hogs-at-the-trough mouthing lying platitudes about equality for all, including illegal criminals who have invaded the USA and if allowed will eventually take over the country.</p>

			<p>I hope she, Gutierrez, Reid, Martinez and the rest of the pro-illegal lobby get their salaries in pesos. They certainly don&rsquo;t deserve taxpayer money. They are loyal to no one but themselves and their agendas. They sell out our country and expect us to like it. They are traitors. Pick up your phones, or fire up the computer and let them know we will never approve anything for illegals except deportation. They all scream that &#8220;we can&rsquo;t deport 12 million people.&#8221; I hate to let them know there are probably twice that number here. We don&rsquo;t have to &#8220;round them up.&#8221; Stop the benefits, jobs and the stupid &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; magnet and they would magically disappear. Problem solved.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the undocumented can become the un-invited at Nancey&rsquo;s house. They can do the work the Pelosis just won&rsquo;t do. They can enrich the Pelosi&rsquo;s bland environment, and if they have a baby in the bathroom they can be instantly added to the Pelosi home deed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll condemn the raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents  the police, and will consider the un-invited as &ldquo;very, very patriotic loyal to the ways, customs and ideals of the Pelosi&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>Kicking in doors is decried because it works. It is a quick and dirty way to find out who&rsquo;s who. Since the primary concern is illegals of mexican/hispanic descent, it should not surprise that raids are concentrated on locations where that particular group concentrates. This is called good law enforcement. You don&rsquo;t go look for illegals from south of the border at the local Polish-American club. We need to stop sacrificing rational judgement in the interest of political correctness, and the fiction that to do so is somehow un-American. </p>

<p>She is many things, but stupid is not one of them.  Point of fact: she&rsquo;s one of the wealthiest (and certainly the most powerful) persons in Congress.  This is what makes her so dangerous.  Her problem is not lack of intelligence.  Rather, it&rsquo;s lack of moral clarity.

			<p>Nancy should be charged and convicted of Treason!!Read the Constitution. Evan the Bible states : Do not push back the boarders that were put in place by your fathers. The majority of illegals ARE Mexican. Just go to any sanctuary city ( santa ana, LA, etc) and you can see all of the &#8220;patriotic contributions&#8221; <br>
      1. display&rsquo;s of mexico flags ( where&rsquo;s O&rsquo;l Glory ?)<br>
      2. gang&rsquo;s, gang&rsquo;s and more gang&rsquo;s<br>
      3. drugs<br>
      4. dirty streets<br>
      5. tons of graffiti<br>
      6. hospital closures that affect entire communities<br>
      7. horrible school districts, dumbing down of cirriculum<br>
         that affect American children<br>
      8. not paying taxes</p>
<p> We need to change or eliminate the 14th amendment. In order for a child to be born a US citizen, at least one parent will be a LEGAL citizen, no excuses.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s totally un-American. And I don&rsquo;t mean raiding workplaces hiring criminal illegal aliens&hellip;</p>
<p>Yesterday we got a call from my wife&rsquo;s sister in Pennsylvania. Seems that the illegal Mexicans are now in the Lancaster area&hellip; AMISH Country for those unfamiliar with Pennsylvania. The damned illegals ARE MUGGING, BEATING UP, KNIFING THE AMISH FARMERS AND ROBBING THEM. Since the Amish religion FORBIDS self-defense of any kind, the Amish folk are easy prey. With reports of knifings, even a couple of farmers murdered, their throats cut by illegal immigrants they were trying to help! </p>
<p>Americans are going to have to take the law into their own hands, sooner or later. Because the Mexican criminals are EVERYWHERE in our country. They&rsquo;re even worse than Blacks, if that&rsquo;s humanly possible&hellip; preying on the Amish folk.</p>
