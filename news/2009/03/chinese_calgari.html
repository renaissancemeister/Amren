<h1>Chinese Calgarians Outraged at Call to Limit Ethnic Malls</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Kom, Calgary Herald, March 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Members of Calgary&rsquo;s Chinese community are enraged after a consultant&rsquo;s report commissioned by the city called for Calgary to avoid the development of &#8220;Asian&#8221; malls that serve only one ethnic group.</p>
<p>The report, meanwhile, raises the debate over whether cities should be encouraging ethnic enclaves to pop up or whether those enclaves only isolate certain communities from the larger population.</p>
<p>Chinese residents are angry at being singled out by the consulting company  &mdash;  whose president is Chinese  &mdash;  in a report on how the city should deal with future commercial and retail development.</p>
<p>Calgary should &#8220;avoid the development of &#8216;Asian&rsquo; malls that cater only to a specific ethnic group,&#8221; says the report, posted on the city&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>&#8220;An effort must be made to avoid &#8216;exclusive&rsquo; cultural-specific retail developments, as they lead to marginalized ethnic enclaves which can diminish overall community cohesiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayne Chiu, chief executive of Trico Homes who immigrated to Calgary from Hong Kong in 1982, said the report angered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve kind of singled out the Asian community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I find it kind of offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Asian was replaced with &#8216;Jewish&rsquo; or &#8216;Italian,&rsquo; other people would be offended.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chiu also took exception to the suggestion ethnic centres should be discouraged, saying they act as linchpins for minority communities while also exposing others to different cultures.</p>
<p>Ald. John Mar, a Chinese-Canadian and the only minority member of council, was also peeved.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s not kosher,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I take umbrage to this because we want to encourage ethnic diversity. How does it marginalize these communities? I think it could actually have the opposite effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ald. Ric McIver said he agreed with Chiu and Mar&rsquo;s assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re offended, and I think they&rsquo;re right to be offended,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This needs to be corrected in a report that we paid for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Leung, president of Global Retail Strategies, which wrote the report, said the suggestions were emphasizing that Calgary should avoid putting ethnocentric developments in new communities for fear of creating &#8220;ethnic islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand why certain people are concerned about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a very strong supporter of the Asian community. But we also have to take a look at the commercial realities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leung said Calgary&rsquo;s demographics don&rsquo;t justify ethnic-oriented development in new areas. He cited cities such as Burnaby and Richmond, B.C., where failed ethnic developments led to shuttered buildings and &#8220;black holes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cited T&T; Supermarket, an Asian grocery store with two local outlets, as a successful business because it opens itself to the wider community.</p>
<p>Byron Miller, a geography and urban studies professor at the University of Calgary, said it&rsquo;s often up to ethnic communities themselves  &mdash;  not the city  &mdash;  as to whether they isolate themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethnic communities can be very beneficial in some cases, and in other cases they become what we call ghettos,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pat Gordon, manager of the sustainable city program, said the city wouldn&rsquo;t heed the &#8220;Asian mall&#8221; suggestion, adding it wasn&rsquo;t even within the city&rsquo;s mandate to look at ethnicity. The report, she added, wasn&rsquo;t saying avoid ethnic-centred developments in all cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s not saying don&rsquo;t do it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&rsquo;s saying do it right.&#8221;<br>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right! &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is for <i>whites</i>, not <i>us</i>!</p>
<p><i>The report, meanwhile, raises the debate over whether cities should be encouraging ethnic enclaves to pop up or whether those enclaves only isolate certain communities from the larger population.</i></p>
<p>Judging from the numerous &#8220;race and culture&#8221; &#8216;sociology&rsquo; books in my university library, I&rsquo;ve discovered that - according to these (almost-entirely white) authors, <b>whites are <i>always</i> wrong in whether non-whites &#8220;assimilate&#8221; or not</b>:</p>
<p>Want Ethnicity X to retain it&rsquo;s own race and culture outside White America&rsquo;s? That&rsquo;s <i>racist</i> and <i>exclusionary</i>!<br>
Want Ethnicity X to merge it&rsquo;s own race and culture into White America&rsquo;s? That&rsquo;s <i>racist</i> and <i>assimilative</i>!</p>
<p>Whites can&rsquo;t win, people.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;An effort must be made to avoid &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; cultural-specific retail developments, as they lead to marginalized ethnic enclaves which can diminish overall community cohesiveness.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the nasty side-effects of &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221;, as not every &#8220;culture&#8221; or &#8220;race&#8221; is as openly suicidal as Western white culture and races are.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve kind of singled out the Asian community,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I find it kind of offensive.</i></p>
<p>Well, from what I&rsquo;ve seen the &#8220;Asian community&#8221; are probably the most clannish out of all non-white communities.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If Asian was replaced with &lsquo;Jewish&rsquo; or &lsquo;Italian,&rsquo; other people would be offended.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Be that as it may, the Italians would probably be harangued for &#8220;racism&#8221; (Jews 50/50)</p>
<p>Just goes to show that blacks and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; don&rsquo;t have a monopoly on racial hypocrisy&hellip;</p>

<p>In Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, a white man was the driving force behind hanging China-town banners all over the old Italian district. </p>
<p>Now that the banners are up, the Chinese are pleased at their new ghetto, and will probably fight to keep the banners in place.  </p>

			<p>If they need examples, simply come to Metro Vancouver and see if ehtnic malls cause ethnic enclaves. There&rsquo;s no use arguing over this if there are already examples. Metro Vancouver has the Yaohan Mall, Aberdeen Mall, Crystal Mall, and Tinseltown as examples of Chinese ethnic malls. There are also many smaller strip malls that cater exclusively to Chinese, Koreans and Vietnamese - and yes, they are ethnic enclaves. I have visited these malls extensively, and I am almost always the &#8220;only&#8221; Canadian within sight. These malls usually situate within already established communities, so this brings about more demographic shifts, which follows that Canadians move out as Chinese or others move in. It&rsquo;s rather funny, but it needs pointing out that Chinese people want to live amongst other Chinese people. Speak Chinese. Shop at Chinese stores. Do business with Chinese car salesmen, and enroll their children into schools that are largely Chinese. The results, in Metro Vancouver, are large majority swaths of the city now being, for all intents and purposes, Chinese. The stores are entirely Chinese and in some schools they are exclusively Chinese. The Chinese like it this way. Now, if a Canadian was to express the same inclination for living amonst others like himself, speaking English and showing a desire for his children to be able to play with other Canadian children - why that would be intolerable. And that tells you the kind of people we are dealing with. Some people are just natural cowards and capitulaters, and would sell their grandmother&rsquo;s house to the first ethnic who bid on it just so he could stick his arms under his armpits and declare his liberality. If it weren&rsquo;t so grotesque, it would be funny. </p>

<p>But the idea of replacing Canadians with Chinese immigrants is not offensive to Wayne Chiu. It sounds perfectly natural to him.</p>
<p>Since the Canadian government insists on having Chinese immigrants, and since the Chinese would rather live by themselves, the best solution is to sell the Western half of Canada to China and let the Eastern half of the country to Canadians who would like to remain Canadian.</p>

			<p>After reading this article, I am still puzzled as to why the Canadian Chinese feel that they need their own malls at all&hellip; what is so wrong, in their minds, with Canada&rsquo;s many malls and shopping centers that they need to make their own? </p>
<p>If the Canadian Chinese (and, indeed, any ethnic group anywhere) want a fair and equitable society, demanding the right to their own special ethnic enclaves, to reduce the amount of time they spend with the Nation&rsquo;s majority population, is not the way to do it. </p>

			<p>I love it. Canada is now reaping the benefits of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. Why are they shocked that Chinese prefer to live among other Chinese? What are they going to do -force the Chinese to assimilate at gunpoint?</p>
<p>This article goes hand in glove with the one that appeared here at Amren, a few weeks ago about the black nightclubs that are springing up all over Cuba. It seems the Cuban blacks wanted clubs of their own as a way to promote social solidarity for themselves.</p>
<p><br>
Why can&rsquo;t white politicians and academia seem to understand this? </p>

			<p>Limpet&rsquo;s remark about selling western Canada to the Chinese is absurd.  Let China have in North America a huge land mass full of natural resourses?  No way!  China can have Taiwan and Tibet. Let western Canada become a white homeland.  Call it Boreas.<br>

<p>The grave error in your thoughts is you refer to Chinese living in Canada as &#8220;Canadian Chinese.&#8221; The Chinese in Canada will never think of themselves in this hyphenated term, but rather as Chinese who happen to live in Canada. Read John of Vancouver&rsquo;s comments. He is absolutely right. I also live in Vancouver and there isn&rsquo;t an area in the Greater Vancouver area that doesn&rsquo;t have a significant Chinese population. Some areas, like Richmond, with Chinese only malls and shopping centres, have populations that are over 80 percent Chinese.</p>
<p>Judging by your pseudonym, I assume you&rsquo;re a Jew. There once was a thriving Jewish community in Vancouver around Cambie Street. This neighbourhood&rsquo;s centre was the Oakridge Mall. This mall catered to every shopper. Now the neighbourhood is predominately Chinese and the mall reflects this cultural invasion perfectly. Oakridge Mall is a Chinese mall in a now Chinese enclave. John of Vancouver knows this all to well. Calgarians see what has become of Vancouver, and, even though they cannot stop the flow of these Asian immigrants, they can try to control the ethnicities and race dominations of their neighbourhoods.</p>

			<p>It is all about supply and demand. This is really an attempt to control the market.</p>
<p>The look of the place will reflect the dominant demographic. Happily in Vancouver, this seems to be Chinese. But white people - do not be alarmed. After all the original inhabitants of Canada looked a lot more like me than you.<br>
The place is just reverting to the way it should be.</p>
<p>Fact is whites control a vast proportion of the world&rsquo;s lands - way out of proportion to their actual numbers. About 85percent of this land was wrested from non-white peoples who had lived in their respective places for about forever.</p>
<p>So whites should not be surprised that they find themselves rubbing shoulders with non-whites. Whites went to the world, not the other way round.</p>
<p>In any case, go to Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing. There are expatriate areas with English pubs, Irish pubs, Australian pubs, German restaurants, French restaurants. The pubs really have notices in Chinese. The people you see in those places are mainly white. The thing is, it is not a big deal to most Chinese.</p>
<p><i>The stores are entirely Chinese and in some schools they are exclusively Chinese. The Chinese like it this way. </i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry John. Many of these children will do better on national English examinations than your own. Second generation Chinese generally speak English well.</p>
<p><i>Now, if a Canadian was to express the same inclination for living amonst others like himself, speaking English and showing a desire for his children to be able to play with other Canadian children - why that would be intolerable.</i></p>
<p>Most whites do. People do self-segregate - whites, blacks, yellows all self-segregate. Chinese should not get bashed for mixing with Chinese and whites don&rsquo;t get bashed for mixing with whites. So you are wrong here. It is tolerable. You most likely mix only with whites. Has anyone criticized you for this?</p>
<p><i>There once was a thriving <b>Jewish</b> community in Vancouver around Cambie Street.</i></p>
<p><i>a white man was the driving force behind hanging China-town banners all over the old <b>Italian</b> district.</i> </p>
<p>So obviously it is not only the Chinese who do this. All ethnicities do, including Irish, Italians, Jews etc. If it is OK for these groups, why not the Chinese? Afterall Chinese are no more &#8216;foreign&rsquo; to Canada than the Italians or Jews were. In fact the continent once was exclusively Asiatic.</p>
<p><i>ome people are just natural cowards and capitulaters, and would sell their grandmother&rsquo;s house to the first ethnic who bid on it just so he could stick his arms under his armpits and declare his liberality.</i></p>
<p>I doubt it. Most people sell if they think they can get a good deal. And most people, white or Chinese, do not mind who they sell to as long as they can maximize their profit.</p>
<p><i>I have visited these malls extensively, and I am almost always the &ldquo;only&rdquo; Canadian within sight.</i></p>
<p>No. You are the only <b>white</b> Canadian in sight. The original Canadians looked like me. Not like you.</p>
<p><i>Calgarians see what has become of Vancouver, and, even though they cannot stop the flow of these Asian immigrants, they can try to control the ethnicities and race dominations of their neighbourhoods.</i></p>
<p>Just try. Chinese are not dummies when it comes to using the legal system to their own advantage.</p>

<p>No. You are the only white Canadian in sight. The original Canadians looked like me. Not like you.</p>
<p>Take a picture of yourself and put it beside a picture of Jack Layton, and ask a billion Chinese who is the Canadian. See? You do know what a real Canadian looks like. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the British North America Act, and no the Chungking Dynasty. </p>
<p>You say you have more in kind with the native indians, well I&rsquo;ll drink to that, though I doubt very much the indians think they have much in common with you. But who knows? I have read various web-sites where Chinese just like you declare themselves to be Scotsmen, Australians and Italians. Hey, I know&hellip; try going out to a reserve and calling them brothers. Remember to put your hand out in front of you palm first and say &#8220;how&#8221; often and tell them you want to share your wampum with them. Let us know how that turns out for you.</p>
<p>Saying you are Canadian doesn&rsquo;t make you one, anymore than calling yourself King of the Mackerals makes you a fish. You may be a citizen of Canada, in law, but you are not nationally one of us. Sorry, but we decide who can join the club&hellip; and you can&rsquo;t. Try India, maybe they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re one of them.</p>
<p>Praise sweet Budha, and FREE Tibet!</p>

			<p>Reply to John Liu:</p>
<p>Your interpretation of Canadian history is revisionist and extremely self-serving. The Aboriginlas did not create the modern political country of Canada, WHITES DID! Canada got by just fine for a 100 years without you and your ilk, until the Federal Liberal party decided to flood Anglo-Canada with non-Whites to get cheap votes, by turning our immigration laws into a cheap voter importation system for the Liberals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happily&#8221;? Not for the White Canadians who were within living memory the huge majority of Vancouver&rsquo;s population and were pushed out by unwanted Chinese immigration. </p>
<p>&#8220;In Vancover this seems to be Chinese&#8221;.. &#8220;Seems to be&#8221;? Like this just happened out of the blue? Perhaps those Chinese just popped out of the ground like mushrooms? Those Chinese are mostly here as a flood of unwanted immigrants. Such self-serving statements. </p>

<p>Until the late 1960&rsquo;s Canada was almost 99% White. Canadians never wanted the mass immigration of non-Whites from the third world. It was imposed on us by a treasonous Liberal party.</p>

<p>If this were true, I&rsquo;d agree.  The truth is that there are LAWS in place to prevent whites from interacting exclusively with other whites.  Chinese (and other minorities) are allowed to self-segregate, but whites are forced BY LAW to incorporate people of other races and cultures into their lives.  As a Chinese-Canadian (I presume), you have the right to only associate with other Chinese.  White Canadians have been denied this right by their self-hating suicidal government.</p>
<p>In fact, if these laws weren&rsquo;t in place, Chinese like you (as well as Mestizos, Africans, and Arabs) wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to move to and buy property in majority-White countries like Canada.  We are forced to allow you in, but once you&rsquo;re here apparently you&rsquo;re free to completely exclude us from your Eastern colonies.</p>
<p>As far as the New World Natives looking &#8220;more like you&#8221;, that&rsquo;s just laughable.  It&rsquo;s a complete fantasy and I have no idea what could possibly have possessed you to say such a thing.  </p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands? That much? I would be pleasantly surprised if that was actually the case.</p>
<p>Hey - whites invaded the world the past few hundred years, right up until very recently - in fact they still do a bit a invading - Iraq, Afghanistan - although to be fair not for the purposes of colonisation any more.</p>
<p>Now it is our turn. </p>
<p><i>Not for the White Canadians who were within living memory the huge majority of Vancouver&rsquo;s population and were pushed out by unwanted Chinese immigration.</i></p>
<p>They could have stuck around. No one forced them out - unlike how whites dealt with the Native American tribes.</p>
<p><i>Saying you are Canadian doesn&rsquo;t make you one</i><br>
When did I say that? Never been to the place. Don&rsquo;t like cold weather.</p>
<p><i>though I doubt very much the indians think they have much in common with you.</i><br>
Sure. They are indigenous tribes with no cultural similarities with the Chinese. But does not race trump all here at Amren? No more stupid than whites trying to justify their presence in North America through Kennewicke man.</p>
<p><i>Canada got by just fine for a 100 years without you and your ilk</i></p>
<p>Yes. Canada &#8216;got by.&rsquo; But now she has enterprising Chinese there she will no doubt do even better in future.</p>

<p>Not just us. Irish-Americans, and Italian-Americans and African Americans. And what about the Jews? They pretty much like to retain their traditions and heritage as well.</p>
<p><i>That would be a fine justification for the complete expulsion of Chinese from every European nation.</i></p>

			<p>&#8220;Chiu also took exception to the suggestion ethnic centres should be discouraged, saying they act as linchpins for minority communities while also exposing others to different cultures.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
How this choice of terms to say exactly the same thing, in a more blunt &amp; honest way:<br>
&#8220;&hellip; they serve as beachheads for the Chinese while encroaching upon the existing culture. &#8221; </p>

			<p>Mr Liu is the living embodiment of the reason we passed the Chinese Exclusion act.  You&rsquo;d think these people would have more sense than to goad the host population.  All those posters who want the Mexicans out, but think Asians are OK, ought read Mr Liu&rsquo;s arrogant, smirking posts.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Chinese have such a &lsquo;hive mind&rsquo;, they stick together, they think alike,&#8221; <br>

The Chinese are ordinary people, not THE BORG. It&rsquo;s generally true that the West is a bit too Individualistic, and the East more Collectivist than it should be. The merits of rugged individualism are great but there is a trade-off. Collectivism makes a society/people less susceptible to divide and conquer. Anonymous poster&hellip;you denounce the Chinese, but quite frankly, if Whites were more like them, then the message of this forum would have greater viability.</p>

			<p>&#8220;After all, the original inhabitants of Canada looked a lot more like me than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That turns out not to be the case.  The Kennewick fossil shows that the first inhabitants of North America were caucasoid.  We were here first; we merely came back in 1492.</p>

			<p>There is no such thing as a chinese-Canadian.</p>
<p>Canada was built from the ground up by French &amp; English colonists. The chinese only came later as parasites, once the entitlement system was fully mature.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t 1.5 billion, soon to be 2 billion, chinese in china enough, for goodness sake? Why do they need to colonize Canada as well.</p>
<p>Go home, you are not wanted here.</p>

			<p>I was in a summer academic program in Ukrainian Studies a few years ago.  A large proportion of the students were from Canada. They often spoke of &#8220;Ukrainians&#8221; and &#8220;Canadians&#8221; in Canada as if people of Ukrainian parentage born in Canada were not Canadian, and &#8220;Canadians&#8221; were necessarily not of Ukrainian parentage.  Conversations with this language usually mentioned or alluded to some kind of significant cultural difference. </p>
<p>Canada was 3% Ukrainian the last I checked.  The Canadian Ukrainians do try hard to retain &#8220;old-country&#8221; attitudes and customs and to integrate those with modern forms of expression e.g. literary work. </p>
<p>No it&rsquo;s not just the Chinese.  Anyone here know much about &#8220;Edmon-chuk&#8221;?  </p>
