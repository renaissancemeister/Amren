			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David R. Sands, Washington Times, March 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five years after former President George W. Bush attracted nearly half of the Hispanic vote in the 2004 presidential election, Hispanic Republicans are worrying that support for the party among Latinos is in a free fall.</p>
<p>The mood was distinctly downbeat at times at a recent Capitol Hill gathering sponsored by the Republican National Hispanic Assembly (RHNA) on the &#8220;Future of Hispanics in the GOP.&#8221; For some, the basic question was whether there was any future to discuss.</p>
<p>Leading Hispanic Republican strategists say the natural attraction the party should enjoy with churchgoing, socially conservative Latino voters is being overwhelmed by a single issue: the party&rsquo;s hard-line stance on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that the party will not recover its majority until we get this right,&#8221; said RHNA Chairman Danny Vargas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Party leaders say they recognize the need to mend fences. According to exit polls, Democrats scored a net gain of 13 percent in the presidential election and 15 percent in House races between 2004 and 2008. Republican defections have been particularly severe in states where Hispanics make up at least 30 percent of the electorate, including Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>President Bush received 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, compared with Sen. John Kerry&rsquo;s 53 percent  &mdash;  a record showing for a Republican candidate. In 2008, Republican nominee Sen. John McCain received just 31 percent of the national Hispanic vote, compared to Mr. Obama&rsquo;s 67 percent.</p>
<p>In 2004, Republicans held five of the nine congressional districts along the U.S.-Mexican border; in 2009, all nine seats are occupied by liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need messengers to really capture that region  &mdash;  young, Hispanic, black, a cross section,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to convey that the modern-day GOP looks like the conservative party that stands on principles. But we want to apply them to urban-suburban hip-hop settings.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Said Mr. McConnell, &#8220;In the last election, Hispanic voters turned out in far greater numbers for the Democrat candidates, and sadly, the party that was founded on the principle of racial equality attracted just 4 percent of the African-American vote in the last presidential election. These are not reasons to abandon the effort. They are reasons to work twice as hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The backlash among legal Hispanic voters to the party&rsquo;s policies to date &#8220;has destroyed conservative prospects in the Southwest, weakened them in the West, and wiped them out in New England,&#8221; [Richard Nadler, president of Kansas-based conservative think tank Americas Majority foundation] said.</p>
<p>Former Virginia Republican Sen. George Allen told the Capitol Hill forum the immigration issue had to be handled in a &#8220;rational, thoughtful way,&#8221; but said the party would do better to focus on economic and social issues as a way to woo Hispanic voters. But he said the party as a whole must continue to insist on securing the country&rsquo;s borders against new illegal immigrants before any discussion on how to deal with illegals already here.</p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t the Republican Party try the Hispandering strategy in 2008?</p>
<p>Bush gets 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, and this is said to be a great success.  Last time I looked, 53 percent for your opponent compared to 44 percent to you is a defeat.</p>

			<p>Hispanics are obviously waging a race war  against Native Born White Americans. Numbersusa.com opposes a high level immigration because a high level of immigration-numbersusa.com claims- is bad for hispanics-even though hispanics are enthusiastic about increasing hispanic immigration. Why does anyone give $$$$ to numbersusa.com?</p>

			<p>You CANNOT out-promise the Democratic Party. You can only stand on principles if you want votes consistantly. That&rsquo;s why putting a Black at the head of the GOP is transparent NONSENSE of the first order.</p>

			<p>And so we continue to exit stage Left. Does this look like a rerun of Clinton-Bush? Yes, it does. Let me explain. After Clinton came to power, the Republicans spent eight years convincing us that ANYTHING was better than another Democrat. Even the feckless son of a man who inherited Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s control of the presidency merely because he managed to hang on to some of the things that made Reagan popular. Thus, indirectly, Son of Bush came to be seen as Ronald II, although everyone who encountered his record in Texas tried to tell the country he was a simple/soft minded Wilsonian.</p>
<p>Now comes Obama. The same Republican drum beat we had during Clinton is already pounding out is message. ANYTHING is better than Obama. Even an open borders, pro amnesty minority Republican candidate in 2012 and/or 2016? Yes. And all those dying White people will be so happy to have a Caudillo and his narcotrafficking praetorian guard step in to save them. Will they not?</p>
<p>No White man will ever be president of the United States again, especially no traditionally conservative White man.  Sounds like we need an alternative to the United States, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Immigration?</p>
<p>You mean there are still people so dumb they&rsquo;re trying to board a sinking ship?</p>
<p>Pray tell where they&rsquo;ll be working.</p>
<p>And tell me also that there&rsquo;s not going to be one giant fight over jobs and unjust race preferences in this country and Europe in the coming months. </p>
<p>And what good is amnesty if there&rsquo;s no place to work and overpriced food and necessities?</p>
<p>These pitiful pro-mestizos are acting like it&rsquo;s business as usual.  </p>
<p>For them it will take a complete collapse before they understand that this isn&rsquo;t the land of easy pickings any longer&hellip;&hellip;and conditions are worsening.</p>
<p>The blacks will be calling for them to leave in the coming months.</p>

			<p>I used to feel more optimistic about assimilated Mexicans-Americans.  I grew up around them and never noticed it.  I recently looked at one of those schoolmates websites and was surprised to see so many Spanish names, Garcia, Rodriguez, Martinez, etc.  I suppose that they were the sorts of families that could afford to live in a middle class neighborhood because they acted White, so I never saw them as different.<br>
     But things are different now.  It&rsquo;s as if every good Mexican has a bunch of marginal relatives that need to be here too.  You can&rsquo;t be friends with a Mexican if you don&rsquo;t support unlimited immigration, because they&rsquo;ll call you racist and turn their backs on you, I know from experience.  Non-Spanish speaking, French culture-loving, American music-listening 3rd generation Americans, will still see my acceptance of my own dispossession as a litmus test of human decency.  They seem to be unable to conceive that I should want my own culture to be preserved, even when they show, by the choices they make, that they prefer White culture too.  I was astonished that they would place La Raza before country.  These are not cholos, these people over the years pay tens of thousands of dollars to send their kids to private schools just to avoid the low class Mexicans.  I have taught some of their children, I&rsquo;ve known them for years, I trusted them enough to speak honestly, and they ran to tell one another that I was not a good gringo, but instead, a racist.  <br>
     It saddens me, because I have loved many of the Hispanic kids I&rsquo;ve taught, but it seems that when they have to make a choice, they&rsquo;re Mexicans, not Americans.  No American of Dutch ancestry is telling the politicians, Get right with the Netherlands or I&rsquo;ll vote the other party.  Nor does any American of Mexican ancestry say Get right with Mexico.  These people are just not Americans.</p>

<p>Talk about chasing your tail and then biting it?</p>
<p>There is one way, and only one way, to deal with &#8220;securing the country&rsquo;s borders&#8221; and in a &#8220;rational, thoughtful way,&#8221; Comrade Sen. Allen. That would be to reduce all illegal incursions through the force of arms, end of story.</p>
<p>What a joke this country has become, where we even have to gauge what the &#8220;backlash among legal Hispanic voters&#8221; was. As opposed to what, the impact of illegal &#8220;Hispanic voters?&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Uh, duh&hellip;let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s some message in here we can learn from all this. Hmmm, one issue trumps all with Hispanics. Gee, no, I can&rsquo;t think of anything. Maybe we should call in Sherlock Holmes. In other words, no matter what issues the GOP appeals to Hispanics with, as long as they keep a hard-line stance on immigration, they lose thee Hispanic vote? What could this possibly MEAN??? </p>
<p>If the conservatives are interested in <i>conserving</i> the population balance in the US, conserving our borders, <i>conserving</i> our natural resources, <i>conserving</i> the two-party system, etc. they won&rsquo;t win over these &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; Hispanics? Well, obviously the GOP had better drop all this in order to appeal to those Hispanics. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the answer. </p>
<p>No wonder they&rsquo;re called the stupid party.</p>

			<p>  Non-whites will not vote for the Republicans as long as they are the party of white people. That is why the Republicans elected Steele but the change leaves white people with no reason to vote for the Republican Party that Steele has said he intends to recruit.<br>
  If the leaders of the Republicans do get the non-white votes then the whites have no reason to stay in the party because the new members have little in common interests with the white Republican base.<br>
  A new Party needs to be formed that absolutely demands that affirmative action is over and all illegal immigrants are deported with their non-citizen anchor babies. Amren.com recently noted that La Raza is aware that the interpretation that children of illegal immigrants is not the intent of the Amendment cited to claim citizenship and is a wrong interpretation but the cited article said nothing can be done about it. A new party can do something about many things and if the economy continues to get worse we may see violence and demonstrations in the US. Several prominent commentators and economists have already predicted a time of riots and breakup in the US within the next 2 years. What will be the trigger- I do not know but the anger is growing as more lose their jobs.</p>

			<p><i>churchgoing, socially conservative Latino voters</i></p>
<p>Oh, so that&rsquo;s what explains the 48 percent illegitimacy rate.</p>
<p><i>Said Mr. McConnell, &ldquo;In the last election&hellip;the party that was founded on the principle of racial equality attracted just 4 percent of the African-American vote</i> </p>
<p>Memo to Mitch McConnell: they don&rsquo;t want &#8220;equality.&#8221;  They want your house, your job, and your money.  If that&rsquo;s not obvious from watching the last 30 years I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p><i>The backlash among legal Hispanic voters to the party&rsquo;s policies to date &ldquo;has &hellip;  wiped them out in New England,&rdquo; Nadler said.</i></p>
<p>Have Judd Gregg, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins all been stripped of their party affiliation in the last few months?  I wasn&rsquo;t aware.  Granted, they lost their last Republican in the House in &#8216;08   &mdash;   Chris Shays   &mdash;   but he went down 100% because of his support for the war.</p>
<p>Finally   &mdash;   this was all tried before, in &#8216;06, and it failed disastrously.  Does the name Ken Mehlman ring a bell?  It was such as a disaster that apparently the solution is to try <i>even harder.</i>  Keep hitting your head against that brick wall and it&rsquo;s just bound to give way!</p>

			<p>The feminists/women&rsquo;s movement was invented by leftists to split the white vote.  The feminist/womens movement was never aimed at black women or Latino women, in fact, they can&rsquo;t stand white feminists.  No, it was aimed at white women.  The political shakers on the left successfully convinced white women they were victims and that the solution to their victimhood was to to join forces with the minority political structure.  Most white women vote for democrats and many are supportive or at best indifferent to affirmative action.  </p>
<p>The GOP should spend energy reuniting the white vote.  Whites need to vote as a bloc; otherwise, the GOP will be left with the losing strategy of trying to out-pander the Democrats, which they will never be able to do.<br>

<p>Reagan worshipping has been a catastrophe for Native Born White Americans. WE are living with the consequences of Reagan&rsquo;s 1986 amnesty:the anti-white Kenyan bigot Barack Obama. Who do you think imposed him on Native Born White America? Here is the answer:the hispanic aliens who were amnestied by Reagan and their children who just recently became of voting age. Also, Reagan&rsquo;s Cold War empire require the ideology of the blessings of diversity and as a consequence &hellip;. more non-whites in the US military recieving  m-16 training. One day,Native Born White Americans will be on the recieving end of this military trianing given to post-1965 non-whites. The Cold War has been a death sentence for Native Born White Americans.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s INVERT the issue regarding&hellip; IMMIGRATION</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define what Hispanics need to do, for Americans to allow them to stay&hellip; </p>
<p>Clean up your collective act. Stop expecting American TAXPAYERS to provide you with FREE healthcare, welfare supplements and food stamps.</p>
<p>Learn OUR language, OUR customs. Don&rsquo;t try to live here with the anything goes mentality you had back in Mexico. We don&rsquo;t like trash flung around. We don&rsquo;t enjoy the spectacle of public urination, even defecation. We don&rsquo;t appreciate &#8220;extended families&#8221; sharing a single-family dwelling.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t appreciate thousands of DWI accidents&hellip; by UNINSURED Mexicans either. Nor do we appreciate the vast number of crimes some of these illegal aliens perpetrate after crossing the border. (Hint: HIDING the racial identity of the perps is not the answer. We are only too aware that Hispanics do some 45% of our crimes; Blacks another 45%.)</p>
<p>Try living like human beings&hellip; THEN let&rsquo;s talk about amnesty and welcome you into OUR country.</p>

			<p>By the way, even if the Republican party could attract a majority of asians,blacks,muslims and hispanics to the Republican party&hellip;why would this be good for Native Born White Americans? Obviously it would still be a demographic disaster for Native Born White Americans. Some of you here who claim that &#8220;Republican values&#8221; are anathema to post-1965 non-whites are conceding way to much to the race replacers in the Republican party. Concievably-and maybe..quite possible-there could be a post-1965 non-white version of the Republican party.</p>
<p>The Republican party is repellant. Recently, the head of the Republican party was the homosexual multimillionaire race replacement enthusiast Ken Mehlman. Today, the head of the Republican party is the anti-white black Male bigot Steele. The unoffcial head of the Republican party is the childless, fat chickenhawk  Rush Limbaugh who during the Vietnam war era avoided miltary service with a doctors note claiming that Rush was physically unfit for miltary duty because Rush had ingrown  hairs in a cetain part of his body. Conservative Evangelical Christians in South Carolina voted into high office the effeminate looking and speaking race replacement enthusiast Lindsay Grant over an authentic immigation reformer. The Republicans is looking more and more like a party of clowns,freaks and wierdos. Why would any normal White American want anyting to do with the Repulican party?</p>

			<p>FED UPs post is an example of what I wrote about in my last post. Some people who post here just do not get it. White Nationalists are opposed to the idea that America is an idea nation:Republican variety or Democratic variety. WE oppose America as an idea nation because it will lead to Native Born White Americans being reduced an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>Unfotunatley, White Americans such as FED UP will happily vote for Bobby Jindal, race replacement enthusiast and son of LEGAL IMIGRANT hindus because he embodies Republican values such as the race replacement of Native Born White Americans and a war criminals foreign policy(goverment employment program for Southern White Males(military industrial complex(defense spending))).</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s say Bush DID get 44% of the hispanic vote.  Hispanics are less than 10% of the voting population.  So, that&rsquo;s about 4% of the total vote.  With all-out hispandering, maybe the Republicans could get to 2/3rds of the hispanic vote.  That&rsquo;s a big bump of what?  Maybe 2.5%?  Whoop-de-dooo!  </p>
<p>PLUS, hispanics are concentrated in a few states.  Some, like New York, California, New Jersey and Texas are big but not battleground states.  Some, like Arizona, may be swing states but aren&rsquo;t that big.  Therefore, the hispanic vote doesn&rsquo;t change as much as they want you to think.</p>
<p>Whites, on the other hand, are still about 75% of the voting population.  So, if the Republicans lost 100% of the hispanic vote by cracking down on immigration, they&rsquo;d lose at most 4%. If by doing so the GOP increased its share of the middle-class white vote by even 5% it would be a wash.  </p>

			<p>Schoolteacher&rsquo;s rather poignant and well spoken comments underscore what happens when two countries with hugely disparate living standards share a common border which is not rigorously policed.</p>
<p>Mexicans have only done what earlier European immigrants would have done had they been able to.  Fortunately for us, we were separated from Europe by 3000 miles of Atlantic ocean, making it relatively easy to regulate immigration to our liking.  We could do the same with Mexico, albeit somewhat more expensively, were we to muster the political will to do so.   </p>

And we DID it!  Up until recent decades, the border and immigration WERE enforced! This illegal situation is something relatively new&hellip;. and all because of our lax government and our greedy corporations.  Add to that our out-of-control ethnic interest groups, vote-seeking politicians and soul-seeking clergymen, and you have the present mess we&rsquo;re in.<br>

			<p>Let me get this straight, unless we agree to an immigration policy that will guarantee we go from a white country to a Hispanic country, Hispanics won&rsquo;t vote for Republicans. This is like someone telling me they will only love me if I give them the gun that they will use to kill me,. Bush got at best 40% of the Hispanic vote. We need to ask out loud a very simple question. That is &#8220;What is the justification of having an immigration policy that will turn the USA from a majority white country to a majority Hispanic country&#8221;. Ask this to others and keep on asking and expose their racial hypocrisy.</p>

			<p>When will the Republicans realize that most nonwhites will always vote for the Democrats because they offer more handouts?</p>

Answer: Right after we conservative white folks realize that the Republican Party is no longer a white conservative party and abandon it. In short: Probably NEVER!</p>

<p>It can be taken a step further. Throw out hispanics who have transformed US territory into foreign hispanic enclaves. This would include throwing out the  majority of hispanics. It would also include getting rid of THE CUBANS. </p>
<p>It is a mystery to me why Peter Brimelow  and vdare.com has not gone after THE CUBANS in miami. You can not find a clearer example of loss of American territory. Miami is a spanish speaking foreign city. Throw every CUBAN out of OUR AMERICA. They are not OUR KIND. I live for the day when the cubans are thrown out my country. I would be first on line to throw Professor George Borjas out of OUR AMERICA.</p>

<p>Reagan worshipping has been a catastrophe for Native born white Americans.  &mdash;  Jupiter</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with Jupiter, and have said so to conservatives, friends,family,etc.,many times in the past. Not only did Reagan agree to the 1986 amnesty of millions of border criminals, but he also presided over the Savings and Loan Fiasco, also the result of  crooked Wall Street scheming. As for Reagans role in causing the Soviet Union to &#8220;collapse&#8221;  &mdash;   please. The Soviet leaders had long been considering cutting their satellite nations loose, as unsealed  records of the former Soviet Union have shown. There are so many decent and generous people among the American citizenry and I will argue this with anyone who dares challenge it. On the other hand, as Mark Twain pointed out long ago, we are also some of the most gullible people in the world. It&rsquo;s time we wake up and deal with the useless political whores that are ruining this beautiful nation, because, to use a popular expression of late  &mdash;  the &#8220;tipping point&#8221; is very close. I know that some of the posters will again think, how can we deal with them, it&rsquo;s hopeless. I would agree with this sentiment, if we continue as before, apathetic, never voting out, RABIDLY, RABIDLY,  those people, who constantly raise taxes without the citizenries consent(I live in California), allow the continued illegal immigration of millions, and give money to racist ethnic interest groups. Again, it isn&rsquo;t a matter of caring at this point, it is a matter of acting in a literally RABID, FANATICAL, way, as far as voting out, over and over, those who screw the hardworking, taxpaying,  U.S. citizenry.</p>

<p>No mystery! It&rsquo;s very simple.  They were Cuba&rsquo;s business/professional class.  <b>They are anti-communist and pro-business.  </b> That distinguishes them from other Hispanics. </p>
<p>This pro-business orientation is the ideology that has guided the US throughout the Cold War and through most of the 20th century.<br>
  <br>
You can do anything else - socially, culturally, racially - Washington doesn&rsquo;t care. But just don&rsquo;t put your hands on the corporations or their money. Don&rsquo;t mess with the wealthy!</p>

			<p>Hey, Jupiter, et al:</p>
<p>Maybe the reason Mr. Brimelow hasn&rsquo;t attacked the Cubans, as you do, has something to do with the socio-economic stats herein: <a href="/" rel="nofollow">/features/hispanics/index.html,</a> consistent with the fact that Cubans, though you rant contrariwise, have been one of the most succesful and pro-U.S. immigrants (though in truth, they are actually political exiles).  You must understand, Jupiter and all of you other anti-Cuban-minded folks, that those from that forsaken island that first arrived at your shores were, despite the prevailing sterotypical, and fictional Scarface character, the very elite, educated and successful group of newcomers this country has ever seen.  That&rsquo;s right, Cuban aristocracy, as well as the professional classes were transplanted in one fell swoop following the advent of the communist tyranny in the island.  Of course, there have also been not so desirable or criminal elements to have arrived here from the island; however, given the fact that of the total of the so-called nearly 50 million Hispanics in this country, only 3.9% are Cubans and Cuban-Americans, they can&rsquo;t hardly be equated to the masses of criminals from other points south of the border, not withstanding, again, Scarface.   That movie was made in an attempt to besmirch the Cuban exile community and those who wished to escape communism by two leftists, Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma.   </p>
<p>So what vast segments of Miami speak predominantly Spanish.  That&rsquo;s not solely due to Cubans, but also others from many other Spanish-speaking countries, following the former having turned the port city into one of most vibrant economic centers of the country and world (and don&rsquo;t try to tell me otherwise, I know directly that prior to the arrival of the Cubans in Miami, that very city was nothing more than a backwater and retirement community for northeasteners awaiting the final demise, if you catch my drift?).  So you don&rsquo;t like Cubans. Guess what? There&rsquo;s a lot of them I don&rsquo;t like either, as I also don&rsquo;t like anti-American, leftists/communists, in addition to that Che-loving, communist-indoctrinated contingent from all points south of the border.  Thus, unlike the latter, most Cubans in exile here are pro-American, and the sons and daughters of those first arrivals in the early 1960s, and so on, are so throughly assimilated you could not know they were Cuban, unless they specifically told you they were.  Did you check the statistics of Cuban-American enlistments to fight in Viet-Nam following the Bay of Pigs debacle?  Do it.  You might just find it quite educational and enlightening, given the fact of what was done to them by the great JFK during the Bay of Pigs fiasco; and who in doing so, extinguished the last vestige of liberty and freedom Cubans ever had, while installing a communist base in the western hemisphere, but I digress.   </p>
<p>Now, in looking at the above linked socioeconomic statistical profile, notice that the Cubans have attained their status therein after only being in the U.S. for less than 50 years.  Can you and those who think like you, imagine if they had been here as long say, the Irish, Italians, Swedes, Germans, etc., whom by the way also had their ethnolinguistic enclaves?  I believe you would not be so inclined to imagine it, but I will help you.  Per capita, college educated Cuban-Americans have surpassed the economic levels of even the WASPS.  I bet you&rsquo;re shocked, but it&rsquo;s true.  While I don&rsquo;t claim to speak for Mr. Brimelow, whose works I not have read, and frankly don&rsquo;t care to read, the reason why he hasn&rsquo;t attacked the Cubans yet, as you put it, might be that, contrary to the latest hordes of uneducated, Marxist-inclined and leeching newcomers from south of the border, most Cubans have been an asset to this country; to which I might add, has been going on from a very long time prior to the advent of communism in the island in 1959. This began during this very country&rsquo;s own Revolutionary War which, without the early and quite generous financial aid from Cuban high society in the 1700s, would have been in dire straits.  Did you also know that prior to anyone else, with the except of the indigenous indian tribes, the Spanish and Cubans were the ones who founded the first European settlement in the North America?  Yes, St. Agustine was founded by a Spaniard in the name of the Spanish Crown and settled by Cubans.  Did you also know that as of 1959, there were approximately 35,000 Cuban political exiles living in the U.S. versus 120,000 Americans living in Cuba; yet, I never heard of any Cubans wanted to throw anyone out, other than for Castro and the communists, who not only threw out the Americans, but also 1.5 million Cubans. I know that it must irk you to no end to hear all those people speak Spanish, and moreso believe them all to be Cuban, but if you really want to see it at its worst, come on down to Los Angeles, CA, where you will really see the effects of unmitigated immigration and the rampant and entrenched anti-Americanism  &mdash;  not only by hispanics.    </p>
<p>In concluding, Jupiter and all of those like-minded, if you had listened to the Cubans in the U.S. who had repeatedly attempted to forewarn you all about socialism, this country would not be in the straits it finds itself in.  If you think illegal immigration is bad now, just wait until after the One is through.  You will find yourselves, I distinctily suspect, waxing nostalgic about the good old days when only Cubans were allowed to come here. <br>

<p>The cubans have been heavily dependent on 1)goverment handouts and organized crimes. This has been they key to their success. they cubans were always a favored refugee group for the US goverment because of the cold war. The cubans had special scholarship programs set aside for them. And they also recived $$$$$ from he goverment to start businesses and buy homes. And&hellip;because they are classified as hispanic,,,all soughts of affirmative action goodies. I know this for a fact. It wouldn&rsquo;t shock me in the least George Borjas didn&rsquo;t pay a penny for collge. Then throw in the organize crime. This is the basis of the cuban sucess story. The end result is a decadent,violent spanish speaking hispanic foriegn city within the borders of America. </p>
<p>If Peter Brimelow is silent on Miami because he thinks that cubans are the model immigrant then vdare.com should not bre finacially supported. The White American population of south Florida had it  the cubans decades ago. During the Elian Gonzaales incident, Native Born White Americans and the cubans almost came to blows.</p>
<p>By the way, what you wrote about the cubans would also justify with the post-19655 policy of immporting LEGAL immigrants.In other words,it justifies the colonization of America street by street,town by town,stateby state by state by china,india,pakistan and korea.</p>
<p>Miami and south florida is a perfectly example of the point I have been making recently on American Renassaince:the Cold War and the racial and ethnic transformation of the America are inseparable. Or to put it another way:the Cold War and the loss of American territory to foreigners are inseparable.</p>
<p>By the way, cuban &#8220;American&#8221; George Borjas&rsquo;s book &#8220;friends and strangers&#8221; was crucial to the passage of one of Reagan&rsquo;s major amnesties. The benefiaciares of the Ronnie  Reagan amnesties have imposed an anti-white Kenyan bigot upon Native Born White America.Vdare.com should have gone after the cubans in miami a long time ago.</p>

<p>The millions that have been spent trying to overthrow castro and to destroy Vietnam could have been better spent subsidizing the higher education of English speaking White American Youth. If this had done, Miami and large parts of South Florida would be English speaking.</p>
<p>Neither Cuba nor Vietnam were a threat to America&rsquo;s existence. Had Kennedy never put nuclear missles in Turkey pointed at the heartland of Russsia, there would have been no cuban missle crisis. The cuban immigrant community and JFK nearly instigated nuclear WW3. It is now known that the human species was only 60 seconds away from annihilation. Miami is a foreign hispanic city. It has been for fifty years the  most egregious example of the horrors of post-1965 immigration policy. And there has not been a peep about this from Peter Brimelow and the vdare.com collective. The cubans in Miami and NJ have been a cancer on American politics.</p>
