<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29470143/">In Down Times, Hispanic Market Is Booming</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timothy Sun and Alex Johnson, NBC News, March 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With more than 46 million people, Nuevo Hispania is the 27th-largest nation on Earth and the fourth largest in the Western Hemisphere. Its residents wield $1 trillion of buying power in the marketplace. Even as the rest of the economy contracts in the global recession, Nuevo Hispania remains a thriving, even booming, market that&rsquo;s expected to grow by 48 percent in the next four years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even a real country.</p>
<p>The imaginary &#8220;Nuevo Hispania&#8221; is actually a substantial segment of the U.S. population. Hispanics now account for more than 15 percent of the U.S. populace as the nation&rsquo;s largest minority group. And while other demographic sectors are growing only incrementally, the Hispanic population is exploding: The Census Bureau projects that 30 percent of Americans will be of Hispanic and Latino by 2050.</p>
<p>The Hispanic market&rsquo;s growing clout comes even as the recession takes a harsh toll on Latino workers. The elimination of tens of thousands of construction jobs has hit the sector particularly hard, sending the national unemployment rate for Latino males to 11 percent.</p>
<p>For decades, businesses and cultural institutions could afford to ignore the Hispanic market.  Now, they are chasing it aggressively, because that&rsquo;s where the money is.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than a third of the Hispanic population is younger than 18. For the Boy Scouts of America, that&rsquo;s &#8220;a huge opportunity,&#8221; said Robert J. Mazzuca, the organization&rsquo;s chief Scout executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot at stake,&#8221; Mazzuca said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not fulfilling our mission as an organization if we don&rsquo;t see this incredibly rapidly growing and dynamic part of our population and do everything we can to reach out to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To penetrate the cultural divides that have kept Hispanics from joining their ranks, the Scouts reached out to Hispanic Communications Network, a media company based in Washington that specializes in engaging the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>Together with HCN, the Scouts are developing pilot programs in six cities to reach the Hispanic market. There will be radio and TV spots, bilingual and bicultural staff representatives, local community leaders advocating on their behalf  &mdash;  and soccer.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our pilot programs over .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. recent years has been Scouting in soccer, using the attraction of the soccer game to gather Hispanic families around,&#8221; Mazzuca said. The sport is a common interest that draws in families while addressing the issues of individual character development that are at the heart of the Boy Scout experience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Identifying the audience crucial</b></p>
<p>The word &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is misleading. Unlike many other minority groups, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is not a race  &mdash;  it is an umbrella word collecting people of Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and any other Spanish or Latino cultural origin.</p>
<p>They are not united by culture or by history, said Jeffrey M. Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, and Hispanics from different cultures tend to cluster in cohesive urban neighborhoods. What unites them, Humphreys argues in &#8220;The Multicultural Economy,&#8221; is simply the Spanish language.</p>
<p>That means a generic appeal is not enough, said Lorenzo Lopez, director of multicultural media at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The goal is to connect to the culture in a socially relevant way and make sure each community&rsquo;s specific needs is served. For Wal-Mart, that means tailoring individual stores to meet to the demands of the local market.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More than the Spanish language</b></p>
<p>AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, began applying the same principle about seven years ago. Today, the organization has 1.2 million Hispanic members.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching the Hispanic community will continue to be a key focus for us, and we will continue to expand outreach efforts to this demographic,&#8221; said Emilio Pardo, AARP&rsquo;s executive vice president and chief brand officer.</p>
<p>The crucial point, he said, is not just to translate existing programs, publications and services into Spanish. Instead, you have to &#8220;transcreate  &mdash;  to be in the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>AARP &#8220;transcreates&#8221; through its magazine Segunda Juventud, or Second Youth. Billed as &#8220;the only publication for 50+ Hispanic Americans,&#8221; the bilingual magazine tailors AARP&rsquo;s five universal pillars  &mdash;  health, financial security, community, intergenerational issues and fun  &mdash;  to the needs of Hispanic communities.</p>
<p>Hispanics, for instance, tend to have &#8220;stronger intergenerational ties than the general population, with multiple generations living under one roof,&#8221; Pardo said. So the AARP&rsquo;s caregiving and financial advice is geared more toward family-oriented caretaking at home, as opposed to more independent caretaking for its general audience of retirees living alone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 8 percent of Hispanics are over 50, but what is much more important is that this number is expected to more than double by 2025, according to the census,&#8221; Pardo said.  &#8220;The considerable population growth dictates that we look at it as a business imperative.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Hispanic ad firms thrive</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest beneficiaries of the explosion in Hispanic buying power is the U.S. Hispanic advertising industry, which the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies estimates is growing four times faster than all other sectors of the ad industry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The competition is especially acute within the cell phone industry.</p>
<p>In 2006, industry research found that Hispanics &#8220;over-index&#8221; in almost every category: They use more minutes, make long-distance calls, text more and download more ring tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Family and social bonds are stronger than in the general population, and Latinos communicate more with each other,&#8221; said Isaac Mizrahi, director of multicultural marketing communications for Sprint Nextel Corp.</p>
<p>Both Sprint Nextel and AT&T; Inc. have a wide array of tools with which to attract the Hispanic user. AT&T;, for example, has developed 716 Hispanic Intensity Traffic (HIT) stores, where all sales material and staff are bilingual, in high-density Hispanic areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>For Hispanics, Coke is it</b></p>
<p>Perhaps no other mainstream U.S. company has been building bridges to Hispanic customers longer than Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Coke&rsquo;s forays in targeting Hispanics go back more than 30 years. It has been a worldwide sponsor of soccer&rsquo;s World Cup since 1978, frequently features Latino players in its ads, and it had the advantage of having had a strong presence in Latin America: When immigrants came to the United States, they regarded the brand as an iconic representation of their new homeland.</p>

			<p>$1 trillion of buying power?  Says whom?  Does this include some of the insane subprime mortgage amounts in this decade, like a $7 an hour cherry picker who got a $720,000 mortgage?  I&rsquo;d like to see these &#8220;buying power&#8221; figures after several years from now, as these subprime mortgages have stopped.</p>
<p>What part of this includes welfare and social insurance?</p>

			<p>Hispanics are essentially a manual labor force. They contribute little to the intellectual economy in terms of science, engineering and computer programming. That&rsquo;s why they are a net drag on the US economy, and the sooner the illegals are deported along with their anchor babies, the better.</p>

			<p>They are a separate culture with their own language - and that is where their loyalties reside. It makes absolutely no sense to look to them to &#8216;save&rsquo; traditionally white English-speaking institutions. Who says everything has to grow? Even with this &#8216;white minority&rsquo; garbage, there will still be more whites than there are today. Retaining the integrity of the organization is more important than growing it. And are U.S. businesses not capable of marketing to Hispanics in Latin America? What about the global marketplace? Why do the Hispanics have to be within our borders for businesses to market to them? I am not hostile to Hispanics as such. In fact, I&rsquo;ve kicked around the idea of learning Spanish so I can watch TV programs that don&rsquo;t have blacks in them. But I also do not want Hispanics here is such numbers that they steal my children&rsquo;s right to maintain our own culture.</p>

<p>Would you like to make a bet on that, you corrupt yellow journalist?</p>
<p>The collapsing job market will effect mestizos and blacks worst of all.</p>
<p>Tell us at the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010 the same thing and you just might get laughed at in return. <br>

<p>Enough is enough!</p>
<p>I am sick to death of this, simpering and sanctimonious tripe!!!</p>
<p>At 46 million marauding feeder-breeders, one must ask: what about the 20 million or so, that are here illegally?</p>
<p>Or better still: the 6 to 8 million of them or better, and  their &#8220;entitled&#8221; offspring, that got into this country via invader friendly &#8220;amnesties&#8221; through the 1970s to 1990s?</p>
<p>Take the low number of those invading aliens (26 million) and then deduct it from the &#8220;imaginary Nuevo Hispania,&#8221; and what do you get?</p>
<p>Oh, only 20 million and maybe declining?</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen of AR, that is my position and I will never change it; these are alien invaders and they should be expelled, without care or compunction!</p>
<p>End of story; and goodbye, and good riddance, to &#8220;Nuevo Hispania!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps, &#8220;New Egypt&#8221; should be next after that?</p>

<p>The general population of Haiti, maybe, but not any white community.</p>
<p>George W. has been very successful spreading the myth of Hispanic Family Values.</p>

Businesses need pliable and gullible consumers. Whites are now less likely to be swayed by advertising so new consumers must be imported and wooed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already seen ads that incorporated spanish but I won&rsquo;t be surprised when I see ads totally in spanish ignoring the English speaking market. And I have no doubt they&rsquo;re be praised as being visionary, progressive, inclusive, and just plain good for America.</p>

			<p>Oh, come on! Hispanic market booming. Give me a break. They are simply running up their remaining credit cards. Many hispanics that arrived illegally in the U.S. during the last twentyfive years or so, are totally addicted to buying and spending like crazy, because they didn&rsquo;t have squat where they came from. They thought money is almost free in the U.S. because of our insane liberal credit policies for the last twenty or so years. They along with other credit card addicts are soon going to realize things have changed  &mdash;  big time.</p>

			<p>Kent Lake, who made a lot of money by exploiting illegal labor in the San Antonio area, got greedy and lost his shirt in the home construction market.<br>
It couldn&rsquo;t have happened to a nicer guy.<br>
Here&rsquo;s hoping that the same sort of thing happens to all of these other race pandering businesses out there.</p>
