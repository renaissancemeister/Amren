<h1><a href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20090303_europe_xenophobia_and_economic_recession">Europe: Xenophobia and Economic Recession</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stratfor, March 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Xenophobia is ever-present in Europe, but increases dramatically when recessions and economic downturns make resources scarce. Minorities are then seen as either the source of the economic malaise (for example, Jews throughout Europe&rsquo;s history but particularly during the Great Depression) or as unnecessary expenditures of the public purse (such as migrant worker populations across Europe in the post-oil shocks and European recessions of the 1970s and 1980s). The French right-wing party the National Front languished in obscurity throughout the 1970s until recessions, unemployment and France&rsquo;s large migrant population became issues to rally around. Its electoral success lasted beyond the 1980s. Other similar movements across Europe easily replicated this model.</p>
<p>An economic recession also creates problems because businesses will begin seeking out migrant workers. Not only are they often more willing to work for less pay than citizens, but if they are illegal they can be fired without cause or trade union intervention at any time. A prime example of the effects of companies hiring more migrant workers is the series of refinery strikes in the United Kingdom in January and February prompted by the use of foreign labor. These strikes inspired sympathy strikes across the United Kingdom. With unemployment rising, this could become a problem particularly in countries that have only recently become migration destinations, such as Spain (where unemployment is expected to rise above 20 percent in 2009 from 11.3 in 2008) and Ireland (where unemployment is set to rise to above 10 percent in 2009 from 6.5 in 2008).</p>
<p>Many Central European and Balkan countries are facing their first severe economic downturn as democratic societies. Under Communist regimes, firm state control could suppress violence against minorities or simply underreport it. Now, however, far-right groups across the region are launching campaigns against the Roma (particularly in Hungary, through the activity of the ultra right-wing movement the Hungarian Guard, but also in neighboring Slovakia and Romania). Roma are also scapegoated for economic problems and social instability, particularly crime  &mdash;  though it should be noted that Roma criminal gangs are extremely active and violent in Central Europe, the Balkans and Italy. This is not to excuse either Roma violence or anti-Roma attacks; it simply points to a dynamic of social unrest that is at work in Central Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the taboos created in the aftermath of World War II are beginning to slowly erode. {snip}.</p>
<p>The security concerns after the Sept. 11, 2001, Madrid 2004, and London 2005 attacks, combined with a large European Muslim population, adds another dimension to the debate on immigrants and their descendants that only enhances the logic of increased European anti-immigrant and anti-minority sentiment. {snip}</p>
<p><b>The Irony of European Xenophobia</b></p>
<p>Ironically, Europe needs immigration. In the short term, immigration is necessary to fuel economic growth by providing both low-skilled and high-skilled labor. Countries like Austria and Switzerland, which have some of Europe&rsquo;s largest foreign-born populations, would be severely harmed if they lost both low-skilled and high-skilled migrants. Similarly, Germany is estimated to be losing 20 billion euro (US$25.2 billion) a year mainly due to a shortage of information technology experts, engineers and other professionals. The situation is similar in France and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, the real problem is that Europe is facing a long-term demographic challenge that will be insurmountable without an overwhelming increase in immigration. {snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European welfare states are placing enormous strains on the public purse, particularly in terms of government expenditures on old-age pensions. {snip}</p>
<p>However, the anti-immigrant impulse in Europe is a strong one, and one that we expect to see emerge with vigor this summer due to the economic crisis. Thus, right-wing parties could gain electoral support and begin implementing some comparatively radical anti-immigrant policies. Countries could reverse policies intended to encourage skilled immigration, leading high-skilled migrants to avoid Europe  &mdash;  once the global economic recovery begins  &mdash;  in favor of what they will perceive (correctly or not) as a more welcoming Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United States. This is almost a certainty if violence against immigrants becomes widely publicized.</p>
<p>In the short term, the negative effects of this demographic reality will not be as pronounced, since the pool of the unemployed will be rising anyway due to the global recession, and fewer immigrants will travel to Europe looking for work. However, in the long run, Europe could lose the competition for skilled and unskilled migrants that could  &mdash;  with aging populations across the developed world  &mdash;  determine which economies remain dynamic in the later portions of the 21st century and which languish in continued recessions and social unrest.</p>

			<p>And what is so wrong about a net decrease in the white population of Europe?  It seems that many European cities are crowded to begin with.  The more important thing is their collective attitude towards minorities   &mdash;   it won&rsquo;t matter if there are 200 million or 600 million white Europeans, Europe will decline if they continue their liberal permissiveness towards and pandering to non-whites.</p>

<p>I love how these P.C. &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; have the <i>briefest</i> flashes of reality, then swiftly harangue and contradict the almost-prophetic visions they just had (just like the U.S. State Department, which acknowledged that black-on-white rapes were far in excess of white-on-black rapes, then &#8220;justified&#8221; this by saying <i>there wasn&rsquo;t enough data to collect on the latter group</i>) .</p>
<p><i>Ironically, Europe needs immigration. In the short term, immigration is necessary to fuel economic growth by providing both low-skilled and high-skilled labor. </i></p>
<p>&hellip;except <i>how</i> many reports are released a month that find - surprise, surprise - these &#8220;model minorities&#8221; swiftly become a drain on public welfare once they arrive?<br>
Didn&rsquo;t a British government committee last year find that the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of immigration to the British economy in the last few decades were <i>almost negligble</i>?</p>
<p>The problem is, the author - I assume - is speaking from a purely <i>economist</i> viewpoint in which reality is merely <i>simplified</i>:<br>
To an economist, <i>all</i> persons - regardless of racial or cultural background - are the same if they have the same age, skill and wealth - it doesn&rsquo;t matter if that immigrant bricklayer from Algeria rioted in 2005 while the French bricklayer didn&rsquo;t, they are the <i>same</i>.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the problem lies</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ironically, Europe needs immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above statement is the BIG LIE!  Economic viability is achieved not by continually importing people, but by producing something that can be marketed, while decreasing costs of production and social costs.  Once you have achieved a positive balance between production and costs, you do not need additional people.  For example, a nation could be viable with just 10,000 citizens IF it produced something of value (mining, timber, fisheries, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.), and had low social costs (low education, welfare, policing, prison, medical care, new infrastructure costs, etc.).  </p>
<p>However, some businessmen are greedy, and want to sell more land, houses, cars, big screen TV&rsquo;s, etc., while having ample wage-slaves to work in their factories and fields.  To them, each immigrant is a customer or a low-cost worker for their personal business.  But note that this decreases per-capita wealth, because it dramatically increases social costs.  Hence, immigration allows certain selfish individuals to become wealthy, while decreasing the average wealth per person (i.e., your lettuce is a few cents cheaper, but your taxes are thousands of Dollars more).</p>
<p>Governments, likewise, are running a Population Ponzi scheme.  They tax at such a high rate that people cannot save for retirement or medical emergencies.  Instead, the government promises to provide these things.  But the only way that the government can make good on this promise is to recruit more &#8220;suckers&#8221; into the Ponzi scheme   &mdash;   i.e., &#8220;We need more immigrants to support retirees.&#8221;  Everyone knows that Ponzi schemes eventually collapse (that is why they are illegal).  In the USA, we are starting to see the collapse of the US government&rsquo;s Population Ponzi scheme.  Every uneducated illegal Mexican who becomes a citizen (and most of their dozens of children and grandchildren) will cost taxpayerss hundreds of thousands of Dollars in social costs (education, welfare, police, prison, medicare, retirement, auto accidents, etc.), but will contribute little into the tax coffers.  Remember that the lowest 40% of wage earners pay no Federal income tax, and in fact actually receive money (Earned income tax credit) for simply filling out a tax form. Hence, each Third-World immigrant helps to reduce the national standard-of-living.   </p>
<p>The idea that we need to constantly import workers to maintain an economy is THE BIG LIE!</p>

<i>&#8220;Ironically, Europe needs immigration. In the short term, immigration is necessary to fuel economic growth by providing both low-skilled and high-skilled labor.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Will this myth, this lie ever die?</p>
<p>Nations have survived dramatic loses in populations such as during the Black Death and not only survived but flourished after the devastation.</p>
<p>The idea is now that no nation can &#8216;survive&rsquo; without CHEAP labor. What these people are advocating and shoving down our throats is that western nations NEED SLAVE LABOR to survive. They are telling us in modern terms is that no nation can exist without slavery. &#8220;Immigration migration&#8221; is slavery redux.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;(for example, Jews throughout Europe&rsquo;s history but particularly during the Great Depression)&#8221;
<p>And just for good measure, they pour collective anti-Semetic guilt into our wounds in the second sentence of the first paragraph no less. &#8216;To be anti-immigrant is to be anti-Semetic&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re just one step away from being declared Nazis. </p></i></p>

			<p>  Again and again we hear that there is no way to survive except to allow Europe and America to become non-white.  We need the workers is garbage.<br>
  Already we can build robots and have far better and more efficient technology to do most of the jobs we supposedly need more immigrants from the 3rd world to do. There will be more technological breakthroughs.<br>
  Already my cousin uses robots to pick fruit and vegetable. Yes, they can distinguish ripeness and pick only quality fruit and they are many times cheaper and faster than illegal immigrants.<br>
 The land is near its comfortable capacity and more people will cause shortages of water.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ironically, Europe needs immigration. In the short term, immigration is necessary to fuel economic growth by providing both low-skilled and high-skilled labor. Countries like Austria and Switzerland, which have some of Europe&rsquo;s largest foreign-born populations, would be severely harmed if they lost both low-skilled and high-skilled migrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>I never ever held much respect for Stratfor, because their evaluations always are tainted with ideology which is lethal to an organizatiuon that is supposed to make unbiased evaulations.</p>
<p>Too, their ratio of workers to retirees is incorrect, because no foreigners would be needed if the economic dynamics were altered to allow for more retirees and less workers.  It&rsquo;s an economic problem that could easily be solved WITHOUT importing large scale third world crime and poverty units.  It&rsquo;s a disingenuous base that has no validity if it is accepted as the ONLY solution to their SUPPOSED problem.</p>
<p>And when they speak of economic growth, and NEEDING imported rabble, they&rsquo;re basing their distorted opinions on the premise  that they believe this latest collapse will be just a hiccup, when it has gone far beyond that already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to see now just one more faction behind the scare tactics employed to frighten the effeminate multicults into encouraging bombers and terrorists and black killers and robbers to come into their countries.  Notice they never made much mention of the possibility of terrorism by the NEEDED foreigners nor did they mention that they will be the source of much trouble-making, far more than the white natives they just love to always describe as instigators that have to be controlled.</p>
<p>Stratfor is a farce.</p>

			<p>The solution to Europe&rsquo;s problems is to expel the non-Whites, and stop treating their citizens as children.  If there are jobs available and the unemployed Whites won&rsquo;t take them, cut off their benefits and let them starve.  No one is too good to be a janitor.  If they riot and destroy property and attack the police, jail them.  No one has any right to attack other people or their belongings.  If they won&rsquo;t have children, let them know there will be no old age benefits, so they had best save their money.  If they won&rsquo;t make the most elementary and essential contribution to the future of their society, why should the society support them?  The cradle-to-grave security of the Euro-weenies allows them to be children for life.  The honest worker is a fool, when the slacker gets rewarded for doing nothing, and so the honest workers start slacking too.  I threw my youngest out when he somehow couldn&rsquo;t find a job.  The street or the recruiter, and he started growing up real fast.  I hope he doesn&rsquo;t get killed, but better to die in battle that to be a worthless parasite.  </p>

			<p>There are many inconsistencies in this piece.  But rather than list them all, which I&rsquo;m sure others will point out, allow me to point to one glaring problem that is glossed over here.  The article points out that there is a wage problem and that businesses would rather hire cheap immigrant labor to get around onerous labor laws.  Voila!  The leftist criminals who came to power and gained control over European labor movements after WW2 are the prime problem behind so much of the illegal labor problems.  They are CAUSING the influx of cheap labor with their insane wage demands EVEN as they secretly encourage non-European immigration on ideological grounds.  The Marxist labor leaders are actually stabbing their workers in the back by setting up a system that undercuts white workers.  It&rsquo;s despicable and I can&rsquo;t figure out why European workers don&rsquo;t grasp this. Why don&rsquo;t they protest?</p>

			<p>Who is it that keeps saying that White nations need immigrants so much?? The number of people able to retire is going to dwindle and the number of those retirees who will be forced back into the work place is going to increase shortly, so there is no need whatsoever for immigrants. Only the Saudi muslim overlords want MUSLIM immigrants in europe and the U.S./U.K. to further the muslim agenda of overthrowing our governments.</p>

			<p>The author acts as though xenophobia is some sort of mental disease.  Xenophobia is a natural phenonmenon in both good economic times and bad.  When a native has lost his job to an immigrant, when foreign cultures are imposing themselves on your nation&rsquo;s culture, when foreigners are sucking up limited public resources, it&rsquo;s perfectly natural and normal to fear outsiders (ie. to be xenophobic).  This is true now and since the beginning of time.</p>

			<p>Yes, indeed: notwithstanding the will of the native peoples of Europe, they &#8220;need&#8221; huge levels of non-European immigration to stoke &#8220;economic growth&#8221; (i.e., multinational corporate profits) and preserve their welfare states (i.e., continue to provide fat salaries and benefits for European bureaucrats and keep them supplied with a needy Third World &#8220;clientele&#8221;).  <p>What does it matter that the end result will hardly be worth calling &#8220;Europe&#8221; any more?</p></p>

			<p>More propaganda to tell White nations they need all these nonwhite immigrants who end up taking a thousand times more than they will ever put back. We see it all around us here in the USSA! Who are these people who spout such nonsense and the bigger question is WHY they are doing it? Whites would have more babies if they thought those babies would ever have a future in a White nation and not in a multicult one! Who in their right mind would bring White children into this kind of nation that would only end up harming them and discarding them? </p>

			<p>Most of the above posters point out that massive Third World immigration actually harms economies, not helps them. But there is an even more insidious aspect of massive Third-World immigration   &mdash;   it changes forever your culture.  Notice that liberals everywhere work themselves into a red-faced, vein-popping, spit-spewing  altruistic hissy-fit over the destruction of Tibetan culture under massive Chinese immigration.  Same for every tiny primitive tribe in the Amazon or Papua New Guinea.  The Australian Aborigines and the Inuits must also keep their unique culture at all costs. These &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; chant &#8220;Stop cultural genocide now.&#8221;  Yet, these same people declare Europeans to be evil racists when they want to preserve their culture.    </p>

Quite true. And in case it hasn&rsquo;t occurred to you, many a rich democrat would love a free mexican slave too!</p>

			<p>And what is so wrong about a net decrease in the white population of Europe? It seems that many European cities are crowded to begin with. <br>

You&rsquo;re being logical about it, and you&rsquo;re right. <br>
 <br>
But, unfortunately, logic has nothing to do with it. In reality, they (the determined, committed diversitarian fanatics) are hell-bent to have more and more immigrants, no matter what the need or the results, just to DIVERSIFY and de-whiten the population. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point arguing with them. They&rsquo;re slick, but despite all their excuses and alibis to the contrary, that&rsquo;s really all it amounts to. Population replacement!  Too many white people! Don&rsquo;t let them kid you that it&rsquo;s anything else.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Countries like Austria and Switzerland, which have some of Europe&rsquo;s largest foreign-born populations, would be severely harmed if they lost both low-skilled and high-skilled migrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of these migrants are other Europeans along with some Turkish populations.  Employment of European nationals outside of their home countries is common place and it&rsquo;s been around for decades.  The article is trying to confuse the issue with third world immigration. </p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, the taboos created in the aftermath of World War II are beginning to slowly erode.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some countries you can be jailed for just questioning certain aspects of historical events. It&rsquo;s understandable that these laws are designed to prevent extremism from arising in the population, however, having such absurd laws in a supposedly free society sends up a red flag in a person&rsquo;s mind and the laws have the opposite effect they were designed for.  These laws need to be repealed since anything that is truthful can stand the test of scrutiny. </p>

			<p>Liberals and leftists like to point out that the United States has always been a country of immigrants.  What they fail to point out is during the 1600&rsquo;s, 1700&rsquo;s, 1800&rsquo;s and most of the 1900&rsquo;s, the immigrants arriving came from advanced cultures and first world countries like England, France, Germany, Italy and other European states.  Over the last 50 years, the vast majority of the immigrants have come from third world countries, such as those that are coming from Latin America, Africa and Asia.  We are seeing the dertimental effects of this  demographic change all around us.</p>

			<p>Once again, the free-traitors screech their madness. Profit above family, profit above nation, profit above God. These hyper-Capitalists truly are some of the biggest sociopaths in modern history, in many ways they cause more harm than serial killers and gangbangers combined </p>
<p>They are also large in number, I bet every person who has posted can name more than one family member or friend who buys into the religion of Rand.  </p>

			<p>I am sick and tired of hearing these lies!!  No country needs more immigrants to survive.  This is paid PR.  Play LIES enough and people believe it.  Bought and paid for lies.  Natives are being pushed out of work and education and housing to tolerate foreigners.  WHO IS PAYING FOR THE LIES??? Increases in populations seeking feebie government funding is destroying once viable native economies.  The liars want US to believe it is needed!!    V</p>

			<p>V-Dare had a story where one leftist scholar rebuts the SPLC notion that a bad economy leads to an increase in &#8220;hate groups.&#8221;  Then again, this is a leftist scholar who can&rsquo;t see through the scam of it all   &mdash;   all the SPLC is doing is trying to raise money, and piggybacking on the archetypical example of a bad economy leading to right wing extremism   &mdash;   that being 1920s and 30s Germany   &mdash;   hoping to trigger bad memories in the kind of people that Hitler tried to exterminate so that they&rsquo;ll give the SPLC money.</p>

<p>Italy was not in any way an advanced first world culture when they first arrived in America. The south of Italy still is backwards to this day.</p>
