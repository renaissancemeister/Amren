			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel González, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), March 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil-rights investigation of the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office after months of mounting complaints that deputies are discriminating in their enforcement of federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>Officials from the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division notified Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Tuesday that they had begun the investigation, which will focus on whether deputies are engaging in &#8220;patterns or practices of discriminatory police practices and unconstitutional searches and seizures.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio vehemently denies that deputies are illegally profiling as part of his immigration crackdowns. He said Tuesday that he welcomes the investigation and intends to cooperate fully.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Arpaio&rsquo;s illegal-immigration crackdowns have broad public support, they also have led to calls for an examination of his tactics.</p>
<p>Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon asked for a federal investigation of possible civil-rights abuses. Last month, four key Democratic members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee asked Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to investigate Arpaio.</p>
<p>The lawmakers said Arpaio had exceeded the limits of a federal program that gives local police federal immigration-enforcement powers by ordering deputies to &#8220;scour&#8221; Latino neighborhoods looking for illegal immigrants based on skin color.</p>
<p>Arpaio, who was easily re-elected to a fifth term in November, called the investigation politically motivated and vowed to continue to arrest illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio uses the sweeps to enforce the state&rsquo;s employer-sanctions and anti-smuggling laws. He also participates in a federal program that lets local officers enforce federal immigration laws. The sweeps have taken place in mostly Latino neighborhoods or near where day laborers congregate. They have sparked two racial-profiling lawsuits.</p>
<p>The Justice Department frequently receives racial-profiling complaints against police departments, but investigations are rare, said David Harris, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and racial-profiling expert.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harris said this is the first civil-rights investigation stemming from immigration enforcement. The probe could last several months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, the board&rsquo;s lone Democrat and most vocal critic of Arpaio&rsquo;s immigration policies, had planned to help deliver a petition today with 35,000 Internet signatures calling for a Justice Department investigation.</p>

			<p>What, does anyone think that there are going to be thousands of illegal aliens from Norway in the Valley that Sheriff Arpaio should not use a common sense tactic like racial profiling?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say for the sake of discussion that he did not use these tactics.  I bet you the Mexican/Chicano big mouth race groups would be picking on him for not doing so when illegal alien from Mexico with a long rap sheet winds up killing an innocent Mexican child.  Just like Houston Mayor Bill White is now saying that ICE/Feds should deport criminal illegals, amnestyaire that I think he is.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a cop, you have to be where the crime is.  The St. Louis Police Department spends 70 percent of its patrol man-hours in the northern one-third of the city.  You can figure out the rest.  Likewise, when a sheriff in a county of a state bordering Mexico is looking for illegal aliens, he&rsquo;s not going to examine people named Bjornson, Cohen, Smith and Bauer.</p>

<p>Yes, because it&rsquo;s the white Mexicans - most of whom are indistinguishable from Spaniards or other southern Europeans, while others are descended from northern European immigrants - that are flooding Arpaio&rsquo;s county not, say, thousands of mestizos and Native Americans right?</p>

			<p>&#8220;First &ldquo;civil-rights&rdquo; investigation stemming from immigration enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one more reason why this country should collapse.</p>
<p>We are on the verge of the greatest calamity in the history of the world, and the brainless lefties think pursuing their diversity, gun control, and other social engineering should have top priority over everything else.</p>
<p>They concentrate on everything but the important matters.</p>

			<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that those 35,000 signatures came from liberal college kids that were pressured into it by friends or profs. The results of Arpaio&rsquo;s election speak for the opinion of his actual constituency. </p>

			<p>     One by one, the Liberals are picking out those whom they wish to destroy. First it was Rush and now it is Sheriff Joe. They single out an individual and turn on all the power the media has to ruin their reputations and achievements. Rush gave it back to them with both barrels and Sheriff Joe will need all the support he can get from his adoring ( and rightly so ) public. It&rsquo;s time for the talk show hosts and conservative politicians to join together to present a unified front to those who want to destroy them.</p>

			<p>I am from Maricopa County (Sheriff Joes County) and I can say that the Sheriff was elected by a MASSIVE landslide. He does have the backing of the people and all the people need is a name and address of those attacking our beloved Sheriff and I promise they would be harassed into extinction. Their power is in that they remain invisible.</p>

			<p>Agree with Ranger.  Any country the does not have control over its boundaries or foreign people coming and going is no country at all. No country, no laws, no need for a government that has nothing to enforce!   Civil Rights are oxymoron. In USA all have same rights or it is favortism. Sheriffs&rsquo; need to be allowed to enforce laws on the books.   Any investigation is politically motivated and has nothing to do with law enforcement.     V</p>

			<p>When he was asked why he robbed banks, &#8220;Willie the Actor&#8221; Sutton is supposed to have said, &#8220;because that&rsquo;s where the money is.&#8221; This has led to what is called Sutton&rsquo;s Law that states that in attempting to diagnose a problem, one should first do the experiment that can confirm the most likely diagnosis. So physicians are taught to think, &#8220;When you hear hoof beats in Texas, think horses, not zebras.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no fan of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, but wouldn&rsquo;t the illegals aliens in his jurisdiction more likely be Mexican than Mongolians? It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for him to pretend otherwise.</p>

			<p>Democrats never want immigration law to be enforced.  They know that not many whites are self hating enough to vote for them.  So they want to make whites a minority as soon as possible.  If that means bringing in another 20 million illegal immigrants, then so be it.<br>

			<p>Sheriff Joe is doing a great job and making a difference, so naturally the liberals feel they havegot to stop him. I&rsquo;m sure in the end they will manage to hamstring him by the simple means of overwhelming him in numbers too great to resist. It&rsquo;s a shame too, because he is a good man doing a thankless job and cleaning up one little piece of America for Americans, we need so many more like him. GO SHERIFF JOE! </p>

<p>Because the people in charge have decided they want a low IQ population that&rsquo;s easily controlled, that doesn&rsquo;t have enough brainpower to ever stage a revolution that could topple the real leaders of the US and much of the West. So the US gets low IQ Mexicans, Central and South Americans and Africans. Europe gets Africans and low IQ North Africans. A good chunk of acquiescent Asians are brought in to manage the technical infrastructure - the elites hope. The people in charge know that only whites are capable of staging a revolution that could end their game in the US and the West. They are going to do their best to stop Sheriff Arpaio and others like him. Personally, I think it&rsquo;s too late for the elites. Everything is going to crash and for awhile they&rsquo;ll have the upper hand, but eventually they&rsquo;re going to have to run and look for someplace else to fleece. </p>

			<p>During the upcoming 4 yrs., I expect we will see our justice dept. involved in many similar investigations, Janet Reno will pale in comparison to this group. BTW, I think Sherifff Joe should be hailed as an American hero who has served his country,state, and country in a very positive way that we seldom see from elected officials.</p>

			<p>Picture the scene. Four Pheonix police cars are gathered together in a parking lot. All the officers within are sitting there chomping donuts and chatting together as they often do. Suddenly an alarm starts ringing from a nearby bank. </p>
<p>A masked man strolls out, shotgun over one shoulder, bag of cash over the other. He nods at the group of officers, they nod back in acknowledgment. The man strolls over to another nearby bank and does the same thing, then another and then hops on a bus and is never seen again.</p>
<p>The police are later asked &#8220;how could you sit there while he robbed three banks right in fron of you and not apprehend him?&#8221;</p>
<p>They casually reply without a trace of irony &#8220;No way we&rsquo;re touching something like that, THAT&rsquo;S FEDERAL JURISDICTION&#8221;</p>

			<p> Neither the controlled media nor liberals like Joe Arpaio. Because he is a genuine populist leader, they consider him dangerous. They&rsquo;d like to see him replaced or retired. Luckily, Joe has enormous support from his county and his state. He&rsquo;s a hero in my book.  </p>

			<p>Bank robbery is a Federal crime, maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t respond to those.<br>
Regardless, according to the U.S. Constitution the Feds have no authority in the &#8220;Free and Independent State&#8221; of Arizona. The state lawmakers need to start enforcing the Constitution, and throw the federal clowns out.</p>

<p><i>Posted by Anonymous at 6:53 PM on March 12</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a case of federal usurpation.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from the Bill of Rights:</p>
<p><i>Amendment X: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.</i></p>
<p>And here is the only fragment of the U.S. Constitution that delegates an immigration-related power to the federal government:</p>
<p><i>Section 8 - Powers of Congress The Congress shall have Power To [&hellip;] establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization [&hellip;]</i>.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even delegate to the feds a power to enforce that <i>naturalization</i> rule, never mind enforcing and prosecuting any <i>immigration</i> violations.</p>
<p>So, based on 10th Amendment, all immigration enforcement belongs to the state and to the people, and the rest is pure usurpation.</p>

			<p>Bravo Justice Department,investigate a U.S. Sheriff protecting the citizenry, and investigate and jail, by all means U.S. border guards;, but don&rsquo;t investigate the drug dealers living and dealing in neighborhoods on the border and elswhere, because that would be racial profiling.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The sweeps have taken place in mostly Latino neighborhoods or near where day laborers congregate. They have sparked two racial-profiling lawsuits.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an intimidation tactic that just might work. Sheriff Arpaio will be undeterred, but his deputies will likely be the ones targeted repeatedly with law suits directed by MALDEF. Nobody wants to end up like Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s easy to see through all of this. It&rsquo;s a tactic to turn Arizona, the birthplace of conservatism, permanently into a blue state by pumping it full of illegal alien campesinos and their baby-machine wives. The other big target is Texas. Once Texas tips, it&rsquo;s all over for the United States. Our country will become so utterly compromised that in short order every state will quickly become a Hispanic Hell Hole like California. Get ready for the drunk driving fatalities, the political corruption, the violent and petty crime, the disease, the hyperinflated taxes for white homeowners, the crowded emergency rooms, and (ugh) the tagging and litter. Maricopa residents should volunteer to ride shotgun with Arpaio&rsquo;s deputies to make sure there is always an impartial witness with a camera ready to back them up when felonious mestizo border breakers commit perjury.</p>
<p>The first sign they are coming to your neighborhood will be evident on the FM dial. (When I moved to the East Bay in 1994 there wasn&rsquo;t a single Spanish radio station. Now there are six. I hear there are 30 in LA).</p>

<p>Yes, and it didn&rsquo;t take very long did it? I presume the lefties had a long &#8216;hit list&rsquo; fired up and ready to go the nano-second they were able to seize power  &mdash;  with Rush&rsquo;s name at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Here in California, conservative talk radio is under fire.  <br>
This was on Drudge last night:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Conservative talk radio on the wane in California!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The article was from where else?  The left-biased LA Times which in its final dying gasp is going to target every enemy it has and gun relentlessly for their destruction: radio hosts John &amp; Ken, Larry Elder (already off the air) and Doug McIntyre.</p>
<p>These lefties will stop at NOTHING to achieve their &#8216;no prisoners taken&rsquo; goals of utter destruction.  The other side needs to take a hard lesson from them as their tactic of silencing and destroying their enemies often works (do you think they&rsquo;re going to give up so easily on Rush?). Next stop:  The Fairness Doctrine.</p>
