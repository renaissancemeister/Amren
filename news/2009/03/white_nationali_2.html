<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>According to CPAC materials, the group, Youth for Western Civilization, is one of the official co-sponsors, or major donors, of this year&rsquo;s conference. The group has a booth in the CPAC exhibition hall, and its &#8220;Inaugural Reception&#8221; is scheduled to begin at 8:30 p.m. EST in the Palladium Ballroom at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.</p>
<p>In the past, CPAC organizers have shielded the reputation of their mainstream conservative enterprise by forbidding racist organizations like the Council of Conservative Citizens from participating. They may want to take a closer look at Youth for Western Civilization.</p>
<p>One of the group&rsquo;s founders, Marcus Epstein, is a frequent contributor to the white nationalist hate website VDARE.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Epstein is also the head of the Robert A. Taft Club, a Washington, D.C., group whose events regularly feature prominent academic racists like Jared Taylor, the editor of the overtly white supremacist journal American Renaissance.</p>
<p>Another Youth for Western Civilization founder, Kevin DeAnna, has posted several times in recent years to the Spartan Spectator, the website of the Michigan State University chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, or MSU-YAF.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is that all Christians, and white Christians in particular, don&rsquo;t owe any deference to the self-defined racial separatist customs of other people,&#8221; DeAnna posted to Spartan Spectator in July 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Youth for Western Civilization didn&rsquo;t wait for CPAC before throwing its first event. Yesterday, the group sponsored a lecture by immigrant-bashing former Congressman Tom Tancredo on the campus of American University in Washington, D.C. Tancredo spoke on &#8220;Immigration Reform and the Need for Assimilation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Speaking of CPAC, from what I saw and read, even Rush&rsquo;s supposedly highly touted address, I didn&rsquo;t hear much in the way of actual principles discussed.  Other than they&rsquo;re not Obama, and Obama&rsquo;s spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>Which of course, coming from Republican establishment types who said little or nothing when Bush was doing it, is a bit of a laugh.</p>
<p>Also   &mdash;   I know for a fact that CPAC didn&rsquo;t bar the CofCC from participating, which the Council did up until about 1999 (?).  It&rsquo;s that the Council withdrew itself as a sponsoring organization because CPAC kept promoting black and other minority speakers, and white liberal/moderate speakers, and tried to ethnically cleanse Confederate flags and other symbols of Southern heritage.  </p>

			<p>The SPLC is a tax exempt organization, which means, of course, it is forbidden to pursue a one sided political agenda.  Since its entire purpose is in advocating a leftist open border, multicultural agenda, openly supporting politicians who agree with them and denigrating those who do not, can it be any clearer that it has a political agenda and should lose its tax exempt status?</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t happen, of course, because the only organizations that are investigated by the IRS are conservative ones or Christian ones.</p>
<p>We do have one hope left open to us, however.  The big money donors are hurting and have lost billions in this economic debacle so we just might see them reduced in size to the point they no longer can afford their propaganda arm.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if they collapsed altogther?</p>

			<p>Back when I was reading web sites like this for laughs, there was a poster who broke through the media screen enveloping me. He stated that &#8220;Whites as a distinct ethnic group have the absolute right to tell their stories about their heroes to their progeny, without the mandatory inclusion of other races&hellip;&#8221;  Food for thought it was. Thanks for the wake-up call whoever you were.</p>

<p>Laughing out loud, in utter abject disgust!</p>
<p>Dear Comrade Holthouse,</p>
<p>The greatest problem that the Republican Party has today, is not organizations such as: Youth for Western Civilization, The Council of Conservative Citizens, or American Renaissance. It is in fact, anti-white and &#8220;multicultural&#8221; internal terrorist groups such as the: SPLC, NAACP, and La Raza.  </p>
<p>When those fools in the so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; party of the USA realize this, and then totally eradicate your antisocial Red cells, the world (or at least, the USA) will be a much better place. </p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

			<p> In my years of reading AR, I have never seen a white supremacist article. Jared Taylor and other writers have only inveighed against coercive government policies that forbid free association. They have also written about the accomplishments of European-derived societies, which is no different than the ethnic/racial pride that other groups have &amp; which draw no objections from SPLC. And the IQ studies in AR have indicated higher Asian intelligence with whites in the middle. And vdare is not a hate site.  </p>

			<p> Once again the Southern Poverty Leadership Conference (talk about a self-important, blowhard name!) anoints itself as the official &#8220;hate-group designator&#8221; for America.</p>
<p> The handful of leftists who make up the SPLC must be incredibly arrogant to think that anyone but a few on their fringe care two cents about who they think is a &#8220;hate group.&#8221; Of course, if you believed what the left customarily says, you&rsquo;d think that only conservatives and White nationalists are capable of feeling &#8220;hate&#8221; for anyone. WRONG!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a bit odd to hear AMREN referred to as &#8220;&hellip; overtly white supremacist &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Contributing authors have argued that Jews and Asians are intellectually superior to whites and that blacks are superior athletes.  </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more accurate to describe it as a group of white, Asian supremacists?  It&rsquo;s a serious question with a humourous tone.  I can&rsquo;t recall the superiority of whites ever being claimed.</p>

			<p>Forget assimilation Tancredo! There is no such animal. We see what &#8220;assimilating&#8221; unassimiable races has done to America and Europe. I grit my teeth when I hear these neo-con talk show hosts talk about &#8220;assimilation&#8221; as if that is the solution to all our problems. Don&rsquo;t they know it is DEMOGRAHICS alone that will destroy our nation and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are legal or illegal! We were never meant to be a racially mixed multicult nation to begin with. Get a clue people.</p>

			<p>SPLC defintiion of a racist:a White American who has a racial preference for the racial composition of America. He or she prefers America to have a majority White population.</p>
<p>SPLC defintion of a non-racist:a hispanic,asian,muslim or african who supports the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy because it will reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>The racism charge must be thrown directly back at SPLC. </p>
<p>Roy Beck and numbersusa/com stil will not admit the obvious fact that Native Born White Americans exist and that they are greatly harmed by post-1965 immigration policy.Roy Beck will not admit this obvious fact because he accepts millions of dollars from a silicon valley homosexual hedge fund manager. </p>

<p>Marcus Epstein: The <i>Modern</i> &#8216;white nationalist&rsquo; (I won&rsquo;t ask  their opinion on that &#8220;rabid white supremacist&#8221; Michelle Malkin either&hellip;)</p>

<p>I&hellip;don&rsquo;t believe Mr Taylor has ever made a blatant statement that &#8220;whites are superior to non-whites&#8221;:<br>
Though he does express great love for &#8220;his&#8221; race and culture, calling this &#8220;racial supremacism&#8221; is as silly as calling a Chinese person who prefers Chinese food to non-Chinese food an &#8220;East Asian supremacist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh wait, this is the SPLC - I apologise for even <i>believing</i> that they had even a remote understanding of the beliefs of VDare, American Renaissance etc.<br>

			<p>When the related story from last week mentioned &#8216;Youth for Western Civilization&rsquo;, I googled them and had a look at their myspace page and at the SPLC page on these kids.<br>
And all I saw was some clean cut kids who seem intelligent and who have an appreciation of history and they don&rsquo;t like the path that America and the World is going down.</p>
<p>Yester-years patriots are todays hate criminals.<br>
And again whites are the only group who are expected to be colorblind. If America was poor( historically not currently) no one would care, well the money wouldn&rsquo;t be there for groups like the SPLC for a start of course. But there would also be nothing to fight for. <br>
It&rsquo;s not fair to tar and feather these kids for standing up and trying to have a voice, &#8220;A nation of cowards&#8221;, apparently not. <br>
A nation gagged, more likely.<br>
&#8220;Lets have a debate, but before we start you are wrong and your views are illegal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is the SPLC on thier own list of hate groups? Oh that&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s not a matter of hating, it&rsquo;s a matter of whom you hate&#8221;.</p>

			<p>this gang of racketeers, SPLC, now has the gall to call mainstream groups like VDARE racist. Enforcement of immigration laws and discussion, discussion mind you of the contination of immigration in these troubled times, is denounced by these money grubbing hysterical losers as racist.  There is little poverty about SPLC, nothing Southern, and absolutely nothing legal.  However I note that all kinds of leftwing websites like Alternet use press releases and articles from these lying lawyers and haters of American civilization. SPLC are regarded as &#8220;experts&#8221; by the Left, and soon they will be cited by the Brian Williams&rsquo; of the world, should the immigration debate heat up and move to center stage. Given the collapse of American, and the ongoing disemployment of the middle class and working class, we will hear more and more from proimmigration and anti-European American groups. Big Business, Kenya&rsquo;s Favorite Son, and illegal immigrants could form an unholy alliance to recover from the recession by using the cheap if unskilled labor of blacks and latins. The SPLC serves as the blocker for this power sweep, knocking Americans down, denouncing good hardworking people who built this land as racists.</p>
<p>SPLC are bad people.  They deserve to be put out of business.</p>

			<p>The SPLC claim that Vdare is a white nationalist website ranks with Afrocentrist claims that ancient Egyptians were black for shear obtuseness. A few keystrokes can disprove the former, and a peek at the well preserved mummies overturns the latter. If there were not such virulent bias against whites in the MSM, the SPLC would have been toast long ago; not just for misrepresenting facts, but financial fraud as well.</p>

			<p>   These must be scary times for the SPLC. Here you have a self-perpetuating subculture, entirely dependent of a continual series of crises and horror incidents to shake donations out of sympathetic whites (how many members are black, do you think?). Not to mention the withering state of their investments. And we have a black First Family, with an unprecedented number of high positions held by blacks.<br>
   Jesus, what a mess&hellip;what about all those SPLC careerists and their mortgages? And private school for the kids? (You don&rsquo;t think they send their kids to public school in Montgomery, Alabama do you? Would you?)<br>
   So they have to cast around and find darkness ever threatening. It has an almost religious quality. <br>
   Non-denominational, of course.</p>

			<p>The SPLC is another arch-Marxist organization funded by the Globalist Elite.  They&rsquo;re all to quick to label organizations as &#8220;hate groups&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s obvious that the SPLC has hate towards traditional American values, pride in Southern &amp; White heritage.  Typical double-standard!</p>

			<p>Anyone who keeps pushing &#8220;assimilation&#8221; just doesn&rsquo;t understand the first things about genes and distinct peoples.</p>
<p>When some of the Jews in the SPLC celebrate Hanukkah, they should remember that this holiday is to celebrate the Jews refusing to assimilate as Antiochus wanted. Had they assimilated, there might be no Jews today.</p>
<p>Assimilation with very different peoples is genocide.</p>

			<p>VDARE is not a &#8220;white nationalist hate website&#8221;.<br>
American Renaissance is not a &#8220;overtly white supremacist journal&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Southern Povery Law Center is a rich, shakedown, anti-white organization. It hates everything about the South. It has never done anything about poverty, other than their own personal poverty. And they have nothing but contempt for the Law, except to the extent that they love those who break it. They could not possibly defend their choice of name, in public or in court, as having anything remotely associated with their extortion and racketeering operations.</p>
<p>They must have a very thick file on me too. <br>
I hope they choke on it.</p>
<p>Just remember, SPLC&hellip;..the lies you tell two by two&hellip;.you must pay for &hellip;..one by one.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here has labeled Jews or Asians superior to whites. I think research shows that on average these groups tend to do better in certain areas of cognitive ability than whites, and whites do better than these groups on average in other areas of cognitive ability. There is a great deal of overlap among these groups, and despite what some think, Jews are just a &#8220;subset&#8221; of whites. </p>
<p>The SPLC will sink lower than a snake&rsquo;s belly when looking for funds. Fear mongers. Hate mongers. That&rsquo;s all they are. </p>

			<p>It the typical poster on AmRen seems more like a black supremacist. Perhaps whites do hate. The dirty little secret is the only unforgivable crime is to claim whites are victim of something. Conservatives like Rush Limbaugh are tolerated. Those who would speak up for whites are removed from polite society. Or in other words, when whites do what every other interest group does as business as usual, as highest enlightenment, when whites do the exact same thing, it&rsquo;s considered the lowest form of evil. Whites who do the Exact same thing as MLK, Muhammad Ali or Paul Robeson, are considered the embodiment of evil. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up.  </p>

			<p>Right wing?  Yup.  That&rsquo;s what I am.  Thanks for noticing.</p>
<p>Interested in stopping the genocide of white people? Yup. </p>
<p>Like the company of white people and don&rsquo;t like multiculti nonsense?  Yup.</p>
<p>Racist?  Do you mean I hate people of other races?  Nope. I&rsquo;m indifferent to them.  Do you mean I know that races of humans are like breeds of dogs? Yup.  That&rsquo;s simple science.</p>
<p>The reality of today is that many of those who try to browbeat whites into silence with terms such as &#8220;racist&#8221; are anti-white bigots and genocidists.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to start using the term &#8220;genocidists,&#8221; more to describe these jerks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only practical way to put SPLC &#8220;out of business&#8221; is to treat them the same way the way they treat us. As much as one can think vicious attacks, assasination of character, libels, and political thuggery are lowly tactics that are below our standards of civility, unless we resort to methods like that, SPLC will prevail.</p>
<p>Just like Second Amendment confirms the right of American citizens to use deadly force while defending themselves against deadly force, we do have a moral right to throw on SPLC exactly the same (and worse) garbage that they are throwing on us.</p>
<p>And remember what Edmund Burke said: all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.</p>

			<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is a &#8220;White Hate&#8221; group. It, The Southern Poverty Law Center, &#8220;hates&#8221; white people. It is on a mission to denigrate and berate white people whenever it feels the money might be available to do so. I never believed this stuff at first. It certainly, in no way, was American Renaissance articles that made me a believer. These articles just confirmed what I had been led to believe because of the hundreds of television programs, magazine and newspaper articles, and radio shows, that all involved the Southern Poverty Law Center. I started to notice after a while, that whenever Dees or Potock  were complaining about something or &#8220;warning&#8221; about something, it invariably, always, without exception involved white folks. Though I could think of hundreds of examples involving &#8220;minority&#8221;, or &#8220;protected class&#8221; episodes of racism and violent behavior against people outside of their class, The Southern Poverty Law Center, never seemed to be involved in any of their &#8220;evil&#8221;.</p>

			<p>VDARE recently had a blog entry on the expensive and horrible-looking SPLC headquarters along with photos called &#8220;The Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Expensive Poverty Palace&#8221;. Frankly, I think the horrid outside of the building is appropriate as the horridness outside corresponds to the rottenness inside of the SPLC. Here&rsquo;s the link to the article:</p>
<p><br>
https://blog.vdare.com/archives/2009/03/02/the-southern-poverty-law-centers-expensive-poverty-palace/</p>
<p><br>
   Also, for those people who are sick of the SPLC&rsquo;s constant anti-American agenda and constant slandering of groups like VDARE, why not make a small donation to the VDARE website? VDARE is frequently attacked by the SPLC and while VDARE does fight back, they simply don&rsquo;t have the amount of money that the SPLC does.</p>
<p>    Therefore, I&rsquo;m sure that any amount a person can donate to VDARE would be greatly appreciated and would also represent an effort to fight back against the SPLC. </p>

<p><i>VDARE recently had a blog entry on the expensive and horrible-looking SPLC headquarters along with photos called &#8220;The Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Expensive Poverty Palace&#8221;. Frankly, I think the horrid outside of the building is appropriate as the horridness outside corresponds to the rottenness inside of the SPLC.</i></p>
<p>Four years ago, the CofCC National Conference was held in Montgomery.  After the conference, some of us decided to show our appreciation to the poverty palace by means of pickets and marching.  It was the first and probably only time in my life that I saw the Palace with my own eyes.  Taking its tacky measure.  I thought it looked like some gawdy museum of post-modern art that one would find in New York, and that it was wholly out of place in a city like Montgomery that has a lot of graceful older public architecture.</p>
<p>As their current stilted metal trailer was built in the mid-to-late 1990s to replace its former smaller building across the street which it sets, the older building was being converted at the time to a civil rights museum, which will get fewer visitors in one year than the Grand Canyon gets in one hour, I also floated a theory that Dees, Potok, Beirich, Cohen and Co. chose that sort of design in order to show off, as to say &ldquo;screw you Montgomery.&rdquo;  Any state capital city is generally going to be more liberal than the rest of the state, and so it is with Montgomery.  But even there, the SPLC doesn&rsquo;t exactly have the respect of their civic elite, even its daily newspaper.  You gotta think that the SPLC knows it.</p>
<p>Curiously, the building for the Alabama Chapter of the National Education Association is in the same square block as the Poverty Palace.  I could just imagine that there&rsquo;s a conveyor belt wheedling propaganda from south to north.  Two peas in the same pod.</p>

			<p>I totally agree with A Reader regarding this matter. </p>
<p>Fighting the definitions of the discourse by confrontation on slur words like racist, refusing to accept the premise of white evil, </p>
<p>and spreading your objections by email posting and letters to editors, and putting up a fuss about the unequal playing field. </p>
<p>Fight Back with the same tactics. That is the name of the game.</p>

			<p>The main issue the conservatives have with dealing with the left is that more leftists subscribe to the philosophy &#8220;BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY&#8221; than conservatives.  Old-style conservatives, which I would assume encompasses the vast majority of the posters here, want freedom from interference and meddling.  They simply desire to be left alone and not let the government dictate their rights.  The left desires to restructure society to make it fit their egalitarian ideals.  With these different mindsets, it is logical to see why there are more radical leftists than rightists.</p>
<p>In the eyes of left-wing groups such as SPLC, it is perfectly acceptable to lie, cheat, swindle, fabricate, exaggerate, threaten, sue and extort in order to get what they want.  After all, to their mind they know more about what you need than you do!  As a group, the left wing will commit acts up to and including mass murder to try and make reality fit their egalitarian ideals.  Just ask any young naive leftist what should be done about &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to use any ruse, dodge, trick, cunning unlawful method, concealment and veiling of the truth. The basic role is to exploit the conflicting interests of capitalist states.&#8221; Vladimar Lenin</p>

It would be nice if these articles explained to us dummies what they are talking about.</p>

			<p>According to the SPLC, any time a group of whites get together to promote a pro-European/pro-Western viewpoint, suddenly it&rsquo;s &#8220;hate&#8221;.  Since when does promoting your own culture and people IN YOUR OWN NATIVE COUNTRY equal hate?</p>
