<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/?pageId=92019">Truck Ban Prompts Mexican Retaliation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerome R. Corsi, WorldNetDaily, March 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico has announced a decision to increase tariffs on 90 U.S. products in retaliation for a congressional decision last week to remove the funds for the Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Mexican truck demonstration project, making it clear the NAFTA trucking is by no means finished.</p>
<p>WND reported one day after signing the $410 billion omnibus funding bill into law, along with its provisions ending the DOT Mexican truck demonstration projects, President Obama instructed the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to work with Congress, the DOT, the state department and Mexican officials to come up with legislation to create &#8220;a new trucking project that will meet the legitimate concerns&#8221; of Congress under the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.</p>
<p>Then the Mexican Economy Department told a news conference in Mexico City that the new tariffs will affect about $2.4 billion in trade, impacting 90 agricultural and industrial products exported to Mexico from some 40 U.S. cities, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The Teamsters estimate the U.S. government spent $500 million on the Mexican truck pilot program, which began in September 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the Obama administration likely to push forward to meet Mexico&rsquo;s demands before new tariffs are imposed, battle lines appear once again to be forming along lines of determining whether or not Mexican trucks and truck drivers will be able to comply with U.S. standards.</p>
<p>The Mexican truck issue became rancorous over the past two years as Bush administration Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters fought off repeated efforts by Congress to confine Mexican trucks to a narrow 20-mile-wide commercial area north of the southern border.</p>
<p>WND reported that after the truck project began, an examination of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration database revealed hundreds of safety violations by Mexican long-haul rigs on U.S. roads.</p>
<p>The contention of opponents has been that Mexican trucks and truck drivers do not reliably meet U.S. standards.</p>
<p>As WND reported, in a contentious Senate hearing last March, Dorgan got Peters to admit that Mexican drivers were being designated at the border as &#8220;proficient in English&#8221; even though they could explain U.S. traffic signs only in Spanish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Obama backtracking on NAFTA promises?</b></p>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s determination to open the U.S. to Mexican trucks raises questions about whether Obama intends to fulfill campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA to get provisions more favorable to American workers and jobs.</p>
<p>During the presidential campaign, top Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago business school, stirred controversy after reporters learned he traveled to Canada to reassure Canadians that Obama&rsquo;s harsh words about NAFTA were just campaign rhetoric.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, Goolsbee has joined the Obama administration, having taken a leave of absence from the University of Chicago after Obama appointed him chief economist and staff director of the newly created Presidential Economic Recovery Advisory Board, chaired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker.</p>
<p>Obama also appointed Goolsbee to the Council of Economic Advisors, or CEA, which is charged with assisting in the development of White House economic policy.</p>

			<p>President Obama is in the between the rock of the Teamsters and the hard place of Mexico.  Which way will he go?  For me the choice is easy.</p>
<p>Mexico is talking about tariffing our exports.  It just so happens that we don&rsquo;t export anything anymore save jobs.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t we have enough carnage from the Mexican drivers who are here already?  I know someone who lost two of his kids to careless drivers&hellip; one for sure was mowed down by a drunk Mexican.  The killer of the second kid was never apprehended, but witnesses said he may have looked Hispanic.  These incidents happened in two different U.S. states. </p>

			<p> Maybe it&rsquo;s about time this government grows a spine and<br/>
retaliates back. By sending Mexico a bill for the money<br/>
we lose. From their illegals draining our state and federal<br/>
budgets dry. </p>

			<p>I assume the white hating liberal environmentalists will side with the pollution spewing Mexican trucks.</p>

			<p>I wonder if they are going to allow these rattle traps to drive and do business in and through California? I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, because, California Democrats, afterall are so concerned about the environment. You see in California, in order to predict what the Democrats in Sacramento will do, just expect the opposite of what their positions are on any issue. For example, on the environment, which we all know is so &#8220;important&#8221; to the Democrats, expect them to do everything that destroys the environment.For example, Massive population increases through illegal immigration, substandard trucks from Mexico  &mdash;  these things will help the environment,you see. On social issues like jobs that Democrats always carp about, massive legal and illegal immigration will help Americans find jobs. </p>
<p>How much are you contributing to your &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221;. For further information, contact the Democratic Party office near you.</p>

			<p>Not to worry&hellip; in the stimulus bill is a provision for Mexican companies to acquire NEW trucks, that meet all the codes, at very special low interest loans.</p>
<p>So everything is going to OK.  You will see.</p>

			<p>When the first anmesty (which was to be the only and last) came about, the end was in sight. We are now doomed to the next magic wand waving over criminals and from now on, there will never be anyone who applies correctly to come into our country. This administation will sign the death knell if it grants amnesty to those whose first act is to disregard our laws. Being poor is no excuse for crime. I live on a small, fixed income and I have yet to break into anyone&rsquo;s home and rob them because I&rsquo;m entitled!</p>

			<p>It is slow enough with the economy being the way it is for truck drivers. My husband still makes good money but it is not the way it was about a year or so ago. Mexican drivers on the road will not only cut into his revinue but make driving far more dangerous for everyone else. American drivers have very strict rest/drive time rules and I am sure that the Mexicans do not and would not be held to US standards. </p>

			<p>Oh Horrors! Mexico is threatening RETALIATION because Americans don&rsquo;t want their unsafe trucking on OUR roads and streets!</p>
<p>Suppose Americans retaliate a little, too! REFUSE to patronize any business with Mexican workers. Refuse to allow any more Mexican illegals to cross our border. Start forcibly deporting as many illegals as we can round up on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>funds for the Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Mexican truck demonstration project&hellip;..<br/>
Why did a &#8220;Mexican&#8221; truck demonstration project ever need U.S. funding?  I am sure there are very few American citizens that want their tax dollars going towards such funding.<br/>

			<p>   I hope they do add a huge tariff to everything we export to Mexico. The only thing we send them are our jobs. And the few jobs that don&rsquo;t leave the U.S. are manned by Mexicans that can&rsquo;t see that big business uses them as &#8220;production prostitutes&#8221;. They will work for pennies on the dollar. They are then compensated by welfare. Their workmanship is sub-standard. But then they contribute to our society in their own ways. They bring slums, drugs, crime, diseases, etc. </p>
