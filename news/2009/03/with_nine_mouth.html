	<p>Travis {snip} Henry, 30, a former N.F.L. running back who played for three teams from 2001 to 2007, has nine children  &mdash;  each by a different mother, some born as closely as a few months apart.</p>
<p>{snip} The [child-support] disputes have even eclipsed the attention he received after he was indicted on charges of cocaine trafficking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Henry maintained that he was involved long-term with many of the mothers. {snip}</p>

			<p>Why is this even a news item?  Does he want America to start passing the hat so we can feed all those kids?  He&rsquo;s the daddy, he should pay.  Those moms should go out and get jobs, they&rsquo;re responsible too.  You can blame a lot of things on society, but you can never blame a pregnancy on anyone but the two people involved in making it.  </p>

			<p>I rarely hear of black men having multiple children by multiple women being forced to pay child support for all those children.  However, professional athletes are different in that they usually have a lot of money to begin with, so the mothers think that there&rsquo;s something to be had.  No use digging for worms in the Sahara.</p>

			<p>This is the closest thing to a legal &#8220;harem&#8221; we&rsquo;ve got in this country. If it were a white athlete, or <i>any</i> white involved in a story involving having children by nine different mothers, it would be a national scandal. In this case, however, the media won&rsquo;t even raise an eyebrow.</p>

<p>This is the story of not only blacks, but of mestizos also.  They care not one white about being able to provide for a proper upbringing for a kid and whether there will be money to do the job right.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t one politician in this country who has the cajones to stand firm and constantly harp on the subject of the irresponsibility involved in bringing children into this country who can&rsquo;t be properly cared for.<br/>

			<p>He&rsquo;s following (and instinctively compelled to do so) the traditional African marriage/parenting pattern.</p>
<p>His behaviour would be acceptable (even necessary) for a tropical environment such as western Africa where evolutionary survival strategy dictates rapid and copious procreation with little commitment to offspring. But America has child support laws which is patterned after cultural traditions (itself a product of evolutionary psychology) shaped by its founders who came from a northern climate. That&rsquo;s Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s theory in a nutshell as applied to this polygamy case. (The same evolutionary adaptation to environment can explain violence and implusivity among Africans which I will not get into at this time.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an apologist for Travis Henry, just pointing the biological and evolutionary basis of culture in general and in particular this social problem (remember, it&rsquo;s not a problem in traditional Africa) that afflicts African men in Western countries.</p>
<p>On the flip side, African women are well aware of the behaviour of &#8216;players&rsquo; but fully go along with it because they too are driven by the same bioligically influenced behaviour.</p>
<p>The social implication of all this is that America, Britain and others where there is significant black population end up supporting this African practice. The welfare state resembles the plentiful tropics minus forces that keep a population in check.</p>

			<p>I saw this guy on Dr. Phil and of course it seemed Dr. Phil was on his side since he has been &#8220;paying&#8221; a little here and there for that one kid. Then this nutjob said he intended to have all these kids by different women. But of course he is black so he gets the gentle treatment from Dr. Phil, the phoney. Dr. Phil has also said on one of his shows that the black minister, TD Jakes, is his favorite and his &#8220;friend&#8221;&hellip;shows where he is coming from, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>I am a sports fan and I have to say that the behavior of blacks and even some Whites in football is absolutely disgraceful. One can go on and on about the horrible and selfish behavior of non-Whites in sports, Manny Ramirez in baseball and T.O.(Terrel Owens) of the NFL are two names that instantly come to mind. If you are sick of watching thug atheletes and are looking for an exciting sport with great sportsmanship, athleticism and is dominated by Whites then I would recommend watching MMA(mixed martial arts). </p>

			<p>Apparently this is one of those who cant process long term types of issues&hellip; Theres a whole group of people like that.</p>
<p>I dont feel bad for the mommas a bit. They know damm well what they are doing, they are copulating their way to what they think is an 18 yr meal ticket. I see it on the west side of chicago, where they will create a sexual connection with a guy who works at FedEx or the post office, as they know he will be good for a child support check, then do the same thing again and again with different men, essentially using their children as cash crops, so they dont have to work or grow on their own. At the very least they have learned to do the upwardly mobile, no matter how modest the means. </p>

			<p> Many young men get themselves into a similar quandary with the young male article of faith that the whole world revolves around having sex as often as possible (yes, I was once young and foolish, too.) Of course, they seldom manage to father NINE illegitimate children through their irresponsibility, as Henry did.</p>
<p> And black athletes like Henry tend to be among the most irresponsible young men on the planet, with the African proclivity for impregnating as many women as possible, in as short a time as possible, the consequences be damned. Henry&rsquo;s downfall was that for a time he was earning a king&rsquo;s ransom in income, making him an all-too-tempting target for the gold-digging young women he had chosen as temporary mates. An anonymous pimp or drug dealer might be able to blow town upon hearing of a pregnancy he caused, and get away with it. An athlete whose income was once in seven figures hasn&rsquo;t got a chance. Congratulations, Mr. Henry, on making an utter mess of your life.   </p>

<p>Just one thing to add: Mr. Henry actually has 19 mouths to feed, not just nine: nine kids plus nine ex-girlfriends on the make plus Mr. Henry himself makes 19. </p>
<p>And he still has &#8220;the drug thing&#8221; to deal with. </p>

			<p>  Only &#8220;9&#8221; reported mouths to feed, does that include his in that picture, looks like about 3 to 4 mouths there alone. Put this gifted person in prison because he sure as hell won&rsquo;t do anything to support the mess he spawned, at least he won&rsquo;t cause any more.</p>

			<p>In the early 80s in Los Angeles, one of my co-workers was sitting in a courtroom prior to be assigned to a jury pool, and a black man was in front of the judge, explaining why he hadn&rsquo;t paid any support toward a child that he freely acknowledged was his own.  </p>
<p>&#8220;If I supported one of my kids, I&rsquo;d have to support all of them.&#8221;  The judge asked how many kids the guy had.  He had something like 22 children by 17 or 18 different women, while having an annual salary of around $12,000 per year.  The judge was stunned, and said that he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.  (Assuming that the man needed at LEAST $8000 after taxes to survive on himself, there was virtually nothing to be divided by all of the potential claimants.)</p>
<p>My co-worker and I figured that the man may have fathered all of these children deliberately.  If you have two or three children and a job, a woman will go after you.  If you have 22 kids, and a crummy job, it isn&rsquo;t worth bothering.  In the early 80s, child support didn&rsquo;t come directly out of your paycheck, so I&rsquo;m sure the mother who came into court ended up with nothing but legal bills.</p>

			<p>9 kids from 9 different women (that he knows of)?. The logistics of seeing them and being any kind of father to them is a nightmare to contemplate, indeed, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the farthest thing from his mind. Just another absentee father that could care less about all his offspring. It&rsquo;s a black thing.</p>

			<p>Out of his 9 children nowhere does it say how many of the moms were white. I bet its likely that many if not most are white. I see this all the time, the young white girls see the black boys as gods, and that is the poor blacks. Just imagine how they would see a pro athelete&hellip;..  KF</p>

<p>The sad thing is that Manny Ramirez and Terrell Owens get all the press as &#8220;bad athletes&#8221; when all they&rsquo;ve ever been guilty of is egotism and eccentricity.  The behavior of players like Ray Lewis (who was on trial for murder), Jamal Lewis (cocaine trafficking), and numerous cases of assault and spousal abuse are swept under the rug because they give the leagues such a heinous image.  Owens and Ramirez are model citizens compared to a lot of these guys.</p>

			<p>Another sport that hasn&rsquo;t been taken over by non-whites is kayaking (in all its forms-whitewater racing,marathon racing,rodeo boating,et.al.)</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched television for over 20 years,so I have no idea if ESPN devotes a any airtime to it,but you can always watch it on YouTube and other websites.</p>
<p>OR,instead of sitting passively in a recliner and watching someone else do something,you could disconnect the cable,and use the money saved to do something radical like buy a used boat (they aren&rsquo;t expensive,and they&rsquo;re almost indestructible,so once you have it,you can keep it for a long time).</p>
<p>And head out to a local lake or river,or seashore and DO something that&rsquo;s good for you,and that your kids will very likely learn to love.</p>
<p>In 10 years,I&rsquo;ve seen exactly one black guy in a boat,and he looked to be more bi-racial than anything. That,by itself,is a very good reason to encourage your kids and your pale complexioned friends to get started.</p>

			<p>  This isn&rsquo;t news, its typical black behavior. Nothing new about it. I worked for years with a black woman. She often confided to me that blacks do not share the morals of whites. She claimed that blacks felt that they didn&rsquo;t live as long as whites and should &#8220;enjoy&#8221; having many men/women in their lives. Hence, all the illegitimate children. They know that the taxpayers will foot all the bills. Those were her words, not mine.</p>

			<p>We should not let the mommas of these children off of the hook so easily. They are the ones most responsible for having these children. I am sure that they know what  contraception is. A lot of them have a baby fron these sugar daddies because they can get more moolah from them than they can from welfare.</p>

<p>Your comment shows an ignorance of mixed martial arts. I used to train in martial arts and never once used steroids. I have trained with a couple of pro fighters and if they were using steroids then they were doing a hell of a job hiding it from me. In fact, the leading MMA promotions are the leaders in testing for performance enhancing drugs. They are pro-active and automatically suspend fighters for one year if they test positive. You should do some research before making absurd accusations.</p>

<p>Interesting.  We have a young (20 something) black girl working (if you can call it that) as a clerk in our office.  She was knocked up by the black Pitney Bowes delivery guy (she already had two kids by two different &#8220;brothers&#8221; before the latest pregnancy).  Then, for some reason, P-B fired the guy. Maybe he was doing this at other offices?  I guess they saved their insurance company a bundle  &mdash;  I wonder if the company of these baby-makers can be held liable for the actions of their employees.   </p>

<p>With all possible respect, you must be out of your mind if you believe that Randy Coture, GSP, Bobby Locksley, and Brock Lesnar are clean.  Lesnar has acne everywhere and Coture has a head that makes Barry Bonds&rsquo; look like Dino the Flintstone&rsquo;s dog.  Once you know what you are looking for it&rsquo;s easy to spot.  Tim Silvia, BJ Penn, and the Graices are clean, so are Anderson Silva and Fedor, and they are probably the two best, but the clean guys have been, for the most part, been getting their clocks cleaned for the last couple of years.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;What is the standard for black super-athlete &#8216;fatherhooding&rsquo;? What is the average?&hellip; Inquiring minds want to know!..&#8221;</p>
<p>Back when Larry Elder was on the air, he spoke of the recklessness of black super-athletes and their poor image as &#8216;role models.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a little dated, but it gives you some idea as to their irresponsibility:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In May, 1998, &#8216;Sports Illustrated&rsquo; featured an article on the number of NBA players with children out of wedlock. While there have been no studies on athletes and their out-of-wedlock children, insiders say the numbers are staggering. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d say that there might be more kids out of wedlock than there are players in the NBA,&rsquo; says one of the league&rsquo;s top agents, who claims he spends more time dealing with paternity claims than he does negotiating contracts. Len Elmore, an ESPN broadcaster and former NBA player worked as an agent but says he quit in part because of a &#8216;lack of responsibility&rsquo; among his clients. &#8216;For numbers, I would guess that one [out-of-wedlock child] for every player is a good ballpark figure,&rsquo; says Elmore. &#8216;For every player with none, there&rsquo;s a guy with two or three.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.larryelder.com/athletes.html</p>
<p>The Sports Illustrated article doesn&rsquo;t breakdown black vs. White rates of illegitimacy in pro sports (are you surprised?), but I would imagine the vast majority of fatherlessness in this case comes from blacks.</p>
<p>As Walter Williams reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;While blacks are 13% of the population, they are 80% of professional basketball players and 65% of pro football players&hellip;Black illegitimacy (in the general population) stands at 70%&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Your comment shows an ignorance of mixed martial arts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all possible respect, you must be out of your mind if you believe that Randy Coture, GSP, Bobby Locksley, and Brock Lesnar are clean. Lesnar has acne everywhere and Coture has a head that makes Barry Bonds&rsquo; look like Dino the Flintstone&rsquo;s dog. Once you know what you are looking for it&rsquo;s easy to spot. Tim Silvia, BJ Penn, and the Graices are clean, so are Anderson Silva and Fedor, and they are probably the two best, but the clean guys have been, for the most part, been getting their clocks cleaned for the last couple of years.</p>

<p>I have been about 5 feet from Randy Couture numerous times and his head was not larger that Barry Bonds. As far as the other fighters you listed one was Tim Sylvia as clean. You are the one the one that is out of your mind. Sylvia popped for roids years ago. So maybe you should check your facts before saying I&rsquo;m out of my mind. </p>
<p>Besides, how would you know who is juicing or not. Lesnar and GSP both passed drug tests after their last fights. So where is your proof that they juice after they have passed drug tests?</p>

			<p>&#8221; They know damm well what they are doing, they are copulating their way to what they think is an 18 yr meal ticket. I see it on the west side of chicago, where they will create a sexual connection with a guy who works at FedEx or the post office, as they know he will be good for a child support check, then do the same thing again and again with different men, essentially using their children as cash crops,&#8221;</p>
<p>A black male bus driver once complained to me about this.  He said that being out in public all day with a good and more important secure job he is bothered all the time by black women.  He and many of his fellow bus drivers claim the women&rsquo;s main motivation is an 18 year old meal ticket.</p>

<p>Barry Bonds, Clements and Sammy Sosa never failed drug tests either.</p>
