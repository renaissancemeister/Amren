<h1><a href="https://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/201095">Racism &#8216;Starts in the School System and It Ends in Prison&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jon Tattrie, Metro News (Halifax), March 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racism &#8220;starts in the school system and it ends in prison,&#8221; said KC Brooks. The East Preston native was one of about 50 people at an International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination event hosted by The Hub in Halifax. The event was one of several taking place throughout the HRM to recognize the day.</p>
<p>Brooks lived in Toronto and Montreal before returning home.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when I saw the racism that plagues Halifax,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many of his friends became involved in crime after getting &#8220;shunned&#8221; out of the education system.</p>
<p>&#8220;They felt higher learning wasn&rsquo;t for them; or better yet, they weren&rsquo;t for higher learning.&#8221; </p>
<p>Marshall Williams, also from East Preston, said he only realized the role racism plays in Nova Scotia after he graduated from university and began reassessing run-ins he had as a boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look back on it, you go, wait a minute: What was that about?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everybody who&rsquo;s not in a marginalized group is not racist, but a lot of times they may not understand the need for change because they can&rsquo;t see it until someone tells them it&rsquo;s there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Filmmaker Sobaz Benjamin grew up in the U.K., then lived in Grenada, Toronto and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Race travels,&#8221; the father of two said.</p>
<p>He internalized racism, at one point using skin-bleaching creams. Coming to Canada, he found a society that said it celebrates multiculturalism, but &#8220;for most people, that&rsquo;s not their lived reality. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile ideal that we can aspire to, but we&rsquo;re definitely not there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time, I want to do something about racism in Nova Scotia but I didn&rsquo;t know what,&#8221; said Sera Thompson, one of the event organizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I often felt it wasn&rsquo;t my place. Something shifted for me; I took a little bold step and invited people together to have a conversation.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Gang members from Preston are well known as drug dealers and pimps, taking females from Nova Scotia and selling them into the sex trade in central Canadian cities.  </p>
<p>Of course, silence reigns over this issue, because the media doesn&rsquo;t like to put blacks in a bad light.  They must only be portrayed as victims of racism.</p>

			<p>If they&rsquo;re going to try to look for racism in a liberal country, they can hike down to Montgomery, Alabama, head over to the SPLC, and find a lot of racism there while they&rsquo;re at it.</p>

			<p>Sobaz Benjamin is free to leave Canada anytime he wants to. I certainly didn&rsquo;t ask him to come to my country. But he&rsquo;s smart enough to know a good thing when he sees it.</p>

			<p>The title of this article is very apt, except for one word - &#8216;racism&rsquo;. Blacks cannot succeed in the school system as well as Whites and Asians. So their natural tendencies take over, and many of them revert to crime. It&rsquo;s not that racism drives them to failure and various criminal activities - it&rsquo;s that it constitutes their favorite excuse to avoid having to take responsibility, let alone action, for any of their shortcomings and misdeeds.</p>

			<p>When they say &#8216;racism&rsquo; here are they really just referring to black folks? Racism starts in the school system and ends up in prison. It would make a lot more sense to me most times, if, whenever they talk about the horror of racism, instead they would just use the word black folks. </p>
<p>Yes, indeed, we need to get rid of racism. </p>

			<p>&#8220;<i>Coming to Canada, he found a society that said it celebrates multiculturalism, but &ldquo;for most people, that&rsquo;s not their lived reality.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>An understatement to say the least&hellip; and one that has merit. </p>
<p>Canadians were not asked whether we wanted to reduce our white homogeneous nation to a multi-racial Babylonian state that inevitably  invites  dissension and conflict. We have a diminishing 84% White population that is only getting smaller as a result of massive 3rd world immigration, and some of those countries outnumber us by several hundreds of millions of people. </p>
<p>If Sobaz Benjamin has concerns of experiencing &#8220;racism&#8221; in one part of the world, then I would suggest he remove himself from that locale and settle where the majority of people are similar to his own racial background.</p>
<p>No&hellip;Multiculturalism is definitely not a &#8220;worthwhile ideal that we can aspire to&#8221;&hellip;..in fact, we should denounce it whenever it rears its ugly head.</p>

<p>Well, obviously if you don&rsquo;t go to college thn the only alternative is crime. What other choices are there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the typical excuse for Black failure. Even if 100 percent of Blacks graduated high school, they&rsquo;d blame lack of college for their crime rate. It dosen&rsquo;t matter. There will always be an excuse, with the finger usually pointing at the neaest White person.<br>

			<p>Marshall Williams of East Preston only realized the role racism had on him as boy after he graduated from university. So this must be from 10 to 15 years after the fact. Boy talk about a suppressed memory. Sounds an awful lot like many of the victims of the priest abuse scandals in the states. All this comes flooding back to you after a visit to a lawyer or a shrink, or in the case of blacks going to something called International Day for the Elimination of Racism.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true anywhere and it&rsquo;s true among blacks. Most blacks prefer their own communities and the same goes for every racial group anywhere. If only the multiculturalists would stop their insane social engineering project and just let people do what they want instead of always trying to force people together. </p>

<p> He&rsquo;s not that stupid. Blacks NEVER leave White countries once they get into them. They may not be very smart - but their smart enough to KNOW A GOOD THING WHEN THEY SEE IT. Trust me, this clown will be burdening Canadians for a long, long time.</p>

			<p>Duh&hellip; &#8220;racism&#8221; starts in schools? I wish I were bright enough to follow that logic. I&rsquo;d have been ready to swear, crime and dysfunctionality start in school&hellip; and cause the social misfit to land in prison. I mean I was under the impression schools were a place to learn&hellip; to prepare for a future career. But that&rsquo;s my error, since after all, I&rsquo;m a White man and &#8216;book larnin&rsquo; equates to acting like Whitey.</p>
