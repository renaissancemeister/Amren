<h1>Labour MP Predicts Total Islamification of Britain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, March 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour Party MP Shahid Malik has predicted the total Islamification of Britain and a Muslim prime minister, &#8220;Allah willing&#8221;, within the next thirty years.</p>
<p>The remarks were made at the October 2008 &#8220;Global Peace and Unity&#8221; conference held at the Excel London centre, but were deliberately withheld from the video coverage released of that event.</p>
<p>The video speech in which Mr Malik made his remarks has now been released on the internet  &mdash;  nearly five months after the event.</p>
<p>The suppression of the video was clearly designed to try and limit the damage to the ruling Tory and Labour elite, whose immigration policies have led to the situation where a Muslim cabinet minister can confidently predict the total Islamification of this nation.</p>
<p>In his speech, Mr Malik said that he was &#8220;proud of the achievements of the Muslims of this country since 1997.&#8221;</p>
<p>Referring to Muslim members of the British parliament, himself included, Mr Malik went on to say that: &#8220;In 1997 we got our first Muslim MP. In 2001 we had two Muslim MPs. In 2005 we had four Muslim MPs. In Sha&rsquo; Allah [Allah willing], in 2009 (or) 2010 we&rsquo;ll have eight or ten Muslim MPs. In 2014 we&rsquo;ll have 16 Muslim MPs. At this rate the whole parliament will be Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Malik then realised that he had let the cat out of the bag by being too honest, and in an embarrassed tone, he backtracked slightly, saying that was not his intention &#8220;in case any members of the press are present.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd showed no signs of reacting to his remark, and, filled with confidence, he then resumed an explanation of how Britain is to be totally Islamified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am confident, as Britain&rsquo;s first Muslim minister, that, In Sha&rsquo; Allah, in the next thirty years or so, we&rsquo;ll see a prime minister who happens to share my faith,&#8221; Mr Malik said, in reference to the growing Third World population and immigration figures.</p>
<p>The people of Britain cannot say that they have not been warned.</p>
<p>This nation will be Islamified unless the Tory and Labour parties are rejected and the British National Party comes to power.</p>
<p>Mr Malik has spelled it out: the Labour/Tory aim is the destruction of Britain within thirty years.</p>
<p>The BNP seeks the preservation of Britain.</p>
<p>The choice is for the British people to make. It will be either one or the other.</p>

			<p>So many British PMs have pandered to Islam (Margaret Thatcher included) that having an actual Muslim as PM seems superfluous at this point.</p>

			<p>God bless the BNP&hellip;Brits are in alot of trouble and they should be thanking whatever powers they believe in for the moment the BNP came into existence. It is literally their only defense against an increasingly antagonistic, alien force perpetuated by idiotic leftist thinking. </p>
<p>God help them, god help us all.. If Brit&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t fight back now.. Their country, of their historical ancestors generation upon generation passed.. will be forever failed by their modern descendants. Imagine, a Great Britain ruled and populated by third world Muslims driving it into oblivion. It really irks you, more than any Hollywood horror.  </p>

			<p>I keep a close eye on England and the BNP as they are like a canary in a coal mine.<br>
If, God forbid Great Britain falls then we will folow quickly.<br>
Would that we had such an equivalent party here.<br>
How about an ANP?<br>

			<p>Every so often we hear about some atrocity or violation of Human rights in the Muslim world - against women, or children or animals or what have you.  At that point it is the traditionally Christian nations that apply pressure upon the Muslims to set them straight.  Even the Muslims, themselves, know that it is the Western World that enforces codes of Human rights upon the rest of the world.  The Muslim world generally does not care.  The Africans and Asians typically don&rsquo;t care either.  When there is no more &#8220;Western World&#8221;, who will look out for Human rights?  All those leftists who clamor for &#8220;multicultural societies&#8221; to replace Western ones will be the first to holler when they find, all of a sudden, that women are second class citizens again.  That animals no longer have rights.  That children can again be forced into labor and war.  That torture is again common place - and yet they were the ones responsible for all this by eliminating Western culture.  They are either very stupid or very evil or both.</p>

			<p>The British have now been told to their faces and in no uncertain terms what is in store for them. I hope they wake up soon. </p>

			<p>This scottish communist government has already put England in the deep, deep shiggy. It&rsquo;s obvious they will not win the next general election, nor do they want to win. Whoever does win, labour will blast away in opposition to everything proposed, especially to do with immigration and asylum and sceam &#8216;racism&rsquo; at every opportunity. Scotland aleady benefits from free medical care, free university places, Â£1,400 per scottish head extra taken from the English taxpayer, and even the hated wheel-clamping blackmail scam is outlawed by the government in scotland but ignored in England. These scottish MP&rsquo;s and ministers will simply retire back home and abandon England to the pakistani and bangladesh hordes they encouraged and enabled to pour in to live for free and be given cash benefits and housing at the expense of England, but not scotland. This must never happen again. We need a strong pro-English government in power at Westminster who will ignore the anti-English unelected, undemocratic EU rules, especially on asylum and immigration, and legislate to recover England for the English. We start by winning local elections and to remove labour from city councils, along with their tame alien intruders. The BNP is the only legal party proposing anything sensible to put this in effect and eliminate the corrupt postal ballot which favours only muslim immigrant families and distorts the ballot count towards labour candidates, often immigrants nominated by this labour government. Many of those pakistani schoolboys receiving free education in England who stood on their desks and screamed &#8216;allah is great&rsquo; when the twin towers were destroyed are now young terrorists in afghanistan attacking American and British troops with roadside bombs and are financially supported by their families drawing welfare cash provided by the English taxpayer. Enough is enough. </p>

			<p>White flight is the justified proportionate responds to the violence perpetrated by other races. Whites are abandoning everything being pushed out to the suburbs, countryside, States and now entire Countries. Whites will continue to abandon areas like Detroit Michigan, Gerry Indiana, and Los Angles California&hellip; and even London England. Whites are tired of supporting other races who demanded preferential treatment while contributing nothing.</p>

			<p>Reply to Yorkshireman:</p>
<p>I read your post carefully amd agree with you. I really think England needs to JETTISON the U.K. and become an independent nation. The current situation is very unfair to England and I don&rsquo;t think reform is possible. I also think the English would gain financially without Scotland. To say nothing of Northern Ireland&hellip;. </p>

			<p>Yorkshireman - I am in broad agreement with your argument, Sir. </p>
<p>I live in Cleckheaton, which is in the Spen Valley parliamentary consituency, so I have the loathesome Shahid Malik (MP for the Muslim province of Dewsburystan) as my &#8216;neighbour&rsquo;, so to speak. </p>
<p>His evil comments actually give me reason for optimism, though: as the invaders&rsquo; confidence and arrogance grow, they will be more and more prone to loudly and publicly crowing about the Islamic future they envisage. </p>
<p>These triumphist Islamists will finally penetrate the fog of apathy and denial which is all too common in many of our countrymen. That apathy and denial is the only real thing holding back a BNP breakthrough. </p>
<p>I just hope and pray the European Parliament elections in June deliver a very sizeable increase in the BNP&rsquo;s share of the vote. Although the June elections are, in &#8216;real power&rsquo; terms, of only minor importance, they will be a vital test of the BNP&rsquo;s ever-improving electoral prospects.</p>
<p>Hope yet kindles for our poor old, dear old homeland &hellip; . Vote BNP! </p>

<p>To them, such concepts are silly Western nonsense.  What they respect -  and the only thing they understand -  is STRENGTH.</p>

<p>Arrogant and self-centered too.   Pride prevents them from seeing the truth about themselves.<br>
