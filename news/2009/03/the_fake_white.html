<h1>The Fake White Slavemaster Black Slave Rape Epidemic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Lindsay, Robert Lindsay, March 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the conceits of the militant Black movement in the US (in practice, that means most US Blacks) is that they are convinced there was some evil White rape epidemic against Indians and Black women. According to this hate Whitey line, White men are the biggest rapists in the past 500 years, or I guess ever. The whole history of White men has been a history of rape of Indian and Black women.</p>
<p>When a Black woman looks in the mirror, she sees centuries of violence, of rape, evil rape, in her veins, in her soul, in her genes. This was a sexist campaign of extermination against Black women. We White dudes conspired to pollute their illustrious and Nobel Prize winning Black gene pool! Such a crime against humanity! And we thought we were just &#8220;mejorando la raza&#8221; as they call marrying and breeding up-White in Latin America.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s curious about all of this is that White dudes pretty much stopped raping Black chicks altogether in recent years. Most of you have seen the figures that drive White nationalists into conniptions. 37,000 White women raped by Blacks every year. Zero Black women raped by White men every year. So, the greatest rapists that ever lived have suddenly knocked it off for decades now.</p>
<p>What happened? For one thing, it&rsquo;s not legal anymore. At one time, it was about legal for a White to rape a Black woman, and maybe for a Black man too. No one cared. Black female victims did not count.</p>
<p>An interesting figure is that by 1865, 75% of US Blacks were yet unmixed. Yeah, some rape epidemic. Any Latin American country can do better than that. {snip}</p>
<p>There is a phrase in the South that women cringe at. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;splitting the Black Oak&#8221;. It means that young single White guys, back in the day, before sex was free and all that, would go lose their virginity and become a man by sexing a Black girl or lady. {snip}</p>
<p>At the time, loose White chicks were probably in short supply in the South, and most single White women were probably virgins. {snip} White men offered money, favors, whatever men always do. Black women were happy to trade.</p>
<p>Much of the fake rape epidemic occurred from about 1830 on. After slavery was outlawed, it was awfully costly to go buy yourself a slave. By 1830 or so, 30% of workers in the fields were White &#8220;wage slaves&#8221; working for hourly wages alongside Black slaves. By 1860, it was 70%. Slaves by that time were largely contained to the largest plantations. No one else could afford one.</p>
<p>{snip} By the Civil War, a slave cost $60,000 in today&rsquo;s dollars. Few could afford one. We have many reports of owners distressed about White workers having sex with Black female slaves, often for money or various favors. These women were slaves, and they needed every break they could get.</p>

			<p>I have no doubt that a great many Black slaves offered themselves to White men in hopes of improving their offspring&rsquo;s opportunities in life.  They bred without regard to the likelihood of  a father&rsquo;s support in Africa, they breed without regard to the likelihood of a father&rsquo;s support today, why should we suppose that they were unwilling to have a White &#8220;baby daddy&#8221; in the antebellum South?  Particularly when a lighter, smarter child might have a better chance at becoming a house servant?</p>

			<p>The idea that all, or even most congress between white slaveholders and black slave women was rape is absurd on its face.  Just look at women&rsquo;s behavior today.  They fall all over themselves for the &#8220;big man.&#8221;  Nowhere is this more evident than among black women.</p>
<p>These are the chaste, racially-loyal victims of the rapine white man?  Please.  If there was violence surrounding this congress (which was probably far less common than supposed today), it was probably catfights between the sisters to see who got to present herself to the big man.</p>

<p>Absolutely!  All the advantages  to be gained were on the women&rsquo;s side. It was a step up in the world. Having a light baby or access to the master&rsquo;s bedroom gave them preferred treatment and social advantage.  <i> Getting into the master&rsquo;s bed was an achievement for a slave!   </i> There must have been a lot of competition for his attention.  White men (even those who were so inclined) had no need to rape them.  The women would have been willing and eager partners in the deal. They must have been doing everything they could to catch the master&rsquo;s eye.  </p>
<p>Of course, Hollywood movies portray them as helpless, cringing victims,  terrified and trying to resist as best they could.    &mdash;     Pure PC Hollywood propaganda, designed to inflame black rage against whites and to feed white guilt!</p>

			<p>No support whatever is offered for the assertion that blacks were largely unmixed (75% carried no white blood) at the close of the Civil War.  It&rsquo;s an important piece of the argument, and without some support the veracity of the article is completely compromised. </p>

			<p>There was a book or article, written by one of those black feminist types I believe, about white women who had black children. Not just the run of the mill type but on the plantation or something. The children were sent to a special home or something. Apparently it a quite an embarrassment. A nearly traumatizing one to the white husband. </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The idea that all, or even most congress between white slaveholders and black slave women was rape is absurd on its face.</p>
<p>Gen. Robert E. Lee was opposed to slavery, because he believed that slavery as an institution was corrupting to the owners. The British old-style liberal, Lord Acton, said something similar, when he noted that &#8220;absolute power corrupts absolutely&#8221;.</p>
<p>A slaveholder had the power of life and death over his slave. He could have the slave whipped for any (or no) reason, and since he owned the food, he had the ability to with-hold food given to slaves as a punishment. The idea that a slave could have the ability to reject the sexual advances of the master is laughable.</p>
<p>We must not let the white slaveholders off the hook, because their greed (and that of the white, African, and Arab slave traders) is responsible for the race problems we face today. Remember that 80 percent of Southern whites did not own slaves, and slavery was harmful to their economic interests.</p>
<p>The mulatto decendants of the slaveholders are the leaders of the black civil rights organizations today, and they hate whites more than pure blacks do (e.g. Jeremiah Wright and Farrakhan). In the 1920s, the leader of the pure blacks, Marcus Garvey, wanted to lead black Americans back to Africa. This would have solved America&rsquo;s race problem once and for all. He was willing to work with white nationalists of the time to achieve this goal. But mulatto leaders such as WEB Dubois, and the leaders of the NAACP, conspired to have Garvey arrested and jailed. </p>
<p>It is the mulattos and the part-white mestizos, who represent the greatest threat to white racial integrity.</p>

			<p>Black men rape and brutalize white women because they are trying to get &#8220;payback&#8221; against the white slavemasters who they say raped black women, not caring whether they are innocent or not.I think that most of the sexual encounters between white slavemasters and black slave women were not physically forced.</p>

			<p>Strange that white on black rape today is virtually unknown.  The simple fact is that most white males find black African females repellent, unless they&rsquo;re very light with Caucasian features.</p>
<p>I suspect that the incidence of white on black rape in the antebellum South is wildly exaggerated.  Though there was unquestionably a fairly significant level of interbreeding between the races (how else to explain to high incidence of mixed race blacks), I imagine that such behavior was exceptional rather than routine.  Of course, there are men, white and black, who would mount a anthill if they thought it was occupied.</p>

			<p>All one has to do is look at the national rape statistics. It&rsquo;s almost all black or minority on white, not the other way around.</p>
<p>The real crime is the ease with which these premeditated anti-white racist lies are constantly floated in the leftist media.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about 300 years ago BUT I do know current records verify that blacks raped over 39000 white females last year and that whites rapes of blacks was so inconsequential as to be called ZERO. See (FBI Website) The MYTH blacks try to promote is that the average White Man is interested in sex with a black female, this is so far from the truth it is laughable. They (blacks) don&rsquo;t even seem to want their females, prefering white females of questionable beauty and intelligence, so why would we (whites) want them, the answer is WE DON&rsquo;T.</p>

			<p>&#8220;White women raped by Blacks every year. Zero Black women raped by White men every year. So, the greatest rapists that ever lived have suddenly knocked it off for decades now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the rapes that occurred hundreds of years ago had to do with the lowest of the white male gene pool, and in my opinion, they had to be pretty lonely and/or drunk to want to copulate with an African that was a complete stranger to any kind of hygiene at all.</p>
<p>Ask any white male, not a rabid leftist, if he would want to date a black female, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure if he were honest he would say he wouldn&rsquo;t want to, and I think the tiny few male white/female black relationships nowadays would offer the tacit evidence necessary to support that point of view.</p>
<p>Even black men in fairly significant numbers obviously would rather have a woman of a different race, because they&rsquo;re constantly hitting on other races whenever they can, even though black females, percentagewise, have the largest pool of single women than any other group.</p>
<p>Sad but true.  Sorry, but there&rsquo;s no way to make the situation sound any better.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much my take. If there white men/ black women relationships were so big in the past, why aren&rsquo;t they now? When and how did they die out?</p>
<p>None of my white male friends that I know has ever admitted to dating or having sex with a black women. They may make a comment about a black women in Sport Illustrated but no one I know is looking for hook-ups with black women. And I don&rsquo;t see black women chasing down white men.</p>
<p>There just seems to be a disconnect between these stories from the past and today.</p>

			<p>These claims are made for 2 reasons. To offset the real rapes, in which the races are reversed, and to further destroy any pride anyone may have left in the early history of this country.</p>

Yes, there are such men.  There will always be some.   A book that I read long ago stated that it was a &#8220;job&#8221; often delegated to the overseer, or some other person on the plantation, to &#8220;lighten up&#8221; the first generation  of blacks to produce some mulattoes who would be more acceptable to white men for use as concubines and such.</p>
<p>Another book I recall, about old New Orleans, mentioned that prostitutes in the brothels there were ranked according to their degree of whiteness.  In other words,  it was an admission that what white men really wanted was white women   &mdash;    or, failing that, at least  as close to white as possible. </p>
<p>Whites would  normally have little use for pure blacks  (or any interest).  I recall another book, about Africa,  written probably in the 50s, before African independence movements and before anyone heard of political correctness, which quoted a British soldier in Kenya as saying that despite the total lack of white women, the only way he could have sex with a black was to get blind drunk out of his mind.  That strikes me as probably very typical.</p>
<p>As for the  Hollywood image of  helpless black women struggling  against cruel  odds to preserve their precious virtue, the notion of feminine virtue and modesty seems to be a European concept, quite unknown in Africa.  I do know from my own experience in Kenya that the black prostitutes in Nairobi are extremely aggressive about plying their trade.  And they are persistent!   They won&rsquo;t take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer.   On seeing a white man, they will not only approach you on the street, they will pursue you all the way down the street, trying to haggle.  As if your objection was only a matter of price!     </p>
<p>Ah, but you won&rsquo;t see a Hollywood movie showing that!  You will only see cruel white men exploiting the helpless, shy native women who are powerless to resist. </p>

The other MYTH is that all white women secretly crave to have sex with a  black man.  Blacks truly believe this &hellip; both black men and black women.   Certainly all that I have ever known or ever heard. It is a central part of their outlook.</p>

			<p>In the opinion of most of the world I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s safe to say that, generally, white women are the prettiest women of any racial group.  But, Japanese, Chinese, Middle Easterners, Indians, Mestizos, all have a pretty good number of nice looking women in their populations also.</p>
<p>Most black women, except for an unusual one here and there and the largely white-blooded types like Halle Berry and Beyonce, are at the bottom of the ratings list when it comes to female attractiveness.</p>
<p>And we all know that it is attractiveness that draws men, rapists or not.</p>
<p>I wish these black leaders that complain so much about alleged black on white rape years ago would stop and consider these truths.</p>
<p>I imagine any alleged white men who assaulted black women were no doubt some pretty grusome looking thugs themselves&hellip;&hellip;at least for the most part.</p>

			<p>While white slavemasters raping black slaves happened,  it was uncommon. If it had been common, plantations would have been full of mixed offspring as birth control then pretty much didn&rsquo;t exist. The fact that people who were half black and half white were not common shows that rape was not common. Also, not all sex between whites and blacks was rape either.</p>

<p>Exactly.  Can you imagine Thomas Jefferson (let&rsquo;s say) going down to the slave quarters to have a little fun and rape a black  slave who, as you say, was a complete stranger to hygiene and who never had a bath?   I can&rsquo;t picture it.   It stretches the imagination.  But that&rsquo;s Hollywood for you.</p>

In other words, it was an admission that what white men really wanted was white women  &mdash;  or, failing that, at least as close to white as possible. </p>
<p>&gt; You make a good point ghw.<br>
&#8220;Women of Color&#8221; or Creoles (mixed) as we call them in New Orleans often described themselves (even well after slavery) as Mulatto (1/2 &amp; 1/2), Qaudroon (1/4) and even Octaroon (1/8) Black. The latter two were fairly acceptable for even &#8220;elite&#8221; white men to have as willing mistresses in polite society.<br>
The Storyville District (right next to the French QUarter) was the notorious &#8220;red-light&#8221; district in NOLA where all the sailors/ soldiers and other &#8220;ruffians&#8221; would go for a good time in port at the brothels and jazz clubs. There were seperate Black and White brothels but blacks were not allowed in the White ones. The Federal Government ordered Storyville shut down and razed (over the protests of the city Gov.) in 1917 because too many Navy Sailors/ Soldiers were &#8220;mixing&#8221; and catching STD&rsquo;s and being otherwise &#8220;corrupted&#8221; there. <br>
This happens to be the same reason the capitol of Louisiana was moved from New Orleans to Baton Rouge (90 miles away). Too many state politicians were getting caught in compromising situations while convened in New Orleans. The only part left standing of Storyville was Basin Street which later became famous in many blues and jazz songs (Basin Street Blues). Ironically, Basin Street today is the main street through the Iberville Housing Project complex. One of the largest and most notorious black &#8220;projects&#8221; in New Orleans, right across from the French Quarter. It&rsquo;s a Cess-pool of drugs and prostitution, just like always.</p>
<p>My point in telling ya all that was to say, most of the &#8220;Lighter Skinned&#8221; blacks in America today are probably much more likely to be the product of mixed race mistresses and unplanned conceptions in brothels than Master on Slave Rapes.<br>
You also can&rsquo;t ignore the fact that many Whites in the SOuth didn&rsquo;t OWN any land and worked side-by-side with the slaves.<br>

<p>  Your right! The women who were sought out as mistresses by wealthy New Orleans gentlemen were the quadroons and octoroons. In other words, the women who approximated the white ideal. There were even quadroon balls, where wealthy suitors would meet eligible women in a formal setting.  Many of the women were set up as mistresses in small businesses and modest homes. If you suggested that these women should prefer poorer, less educated dark skinned men, I think most of the women would have been truly shocked. Of course, we live in very different times today. </p>

<p>Even if 25% of the African American population was mixed in 1865 and 75% were of pure African bloodline there is still NO need  for any further mixing with Europeans to have a population of 75% mixed African Americans today.   <br>
 </p>
<p>Let me explain - Within that first generation after the Civil War that mixed population (25%) could have mixed / married etc. with 25% of that pure Black population and within one generation 50% of African Americans have some European genes and for future generations these populations continue to overlap each other, producing today&rsquo;s current population of African Americans with little continuous European mixing.  Thus when we examine the African American family tree and go back 8 generations (238 people in that original gene pool)   you will most likely find one person or European descent and/or one person of Native American ancestry out of that group.</p>

<p>I have seen a number of White men with Black women who look like Robin Givens, Lela Rochon, Whitney Houston. These are not light skinned Black women</p>

			<p>There are only about 50,000 White men with black females in the entire country or about the number of people that can be seated at Yankee Stadium.  </p>

			<p><i>The women who were sought out as mistresses by wealthy New Orleans gentlemen were the quadroons and octoroons. In other words, the women who approximated the white ideal. <br>
<b> If you suggested that these women should prefer poorer, less educated dark-skinned men, I think most of the women would have been truly shocked. </b><br>

You&rsquo;re absolutely right!  Those  very light  women sought white men exclusively.  They had a strong revulsion toward black men and freely expressed it. (No political correctness in those days.)  Although I read that book many years ago (when I was 18), I still remember their exact comment:   &#8220;Ils sont dégoutant!&#8221;    [They are repugnant.]</p>
<p>By the way, along those same lines, a Haitian woman whom I once knew, mentioned to me that in Haiti, if a woman is lucky enough to get  a &#8220;pretty&#8221; man who is light-skinned, he expects her to work and to support him.  That is taken for granted.  Furthermore, she is quite willing to do so!</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;My point in telling ya all that was to say, most of the &ldquo;Lighter Skinned�? blacks in America today are probably much more likely to be the product of mixed-race mistresses and unplanned conceptions in brothels than Master on Slave Rapes.&#8221;<br>
Posted by formerly (James from NOLA) </i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Another point to bear in mind is that the mulatto butlers, cooks, musicians, bookkeepeers, etc, who worked in the Big House constituted the aristocracy of the black population (and they still are).  These men received some education, had privileged positions,  and  they would have access to all the black women.  </p>
<p>No doubt they were considered quite a catch for an ordinary slave.  (Just as figures like Andy Young or Jesse Jackson still are today.)  Once the first generation of mulattoes had been produced, the process of lightening-up the blacks would not have to be done by the white slave-owners, as these half-breeds would have been quite willing to do the job for them.   I have little doubt that they were the principals who got this done.</p>
<p>This whole awkward  matter is carefully avoided today, or treated with greatest delicacy. In the USA at least.  But in Latin America, they are much more candid, as we once were. It is called &#8220;improving the population&#8221;  and they make no bones about it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yes, there are such men. There will always be some. A book that I read long ago stated that it was a &ldquo;job�? often delegated to the overseer, or some other person on the plantation, to &ldquo;lighten up�? the first generation of blacks to produce some mulattoes who would be more acceptable to white men for use as concubines and such.</p>
<p>Another book I recall, about old New Orleans, mentioned that prostitutes in the brothels there were ranked according to their degree of whiteness. In other words, it was an admission that what white men really wanted was white women  &mdash;  or, failing that, at least as close to white as possible.<br>

<p>This is not surprising. The French and Spanish racemixed in much greater numbers than the English, and had more mystresses. <br>

We must not let the white slaveholders off the hook, because their greed (and that of the white, African, and Arab slave traders) is responsible for the race problems we face today.  &mdash;    &mdash;   Vonwagner I respectfully have to disagree with most of this statement .It simply is far more compex than that . No doubt the institution of slavery has been a curse to those of us of Euro descent . But the African and their descendants have been blessed by it .                                                                                         Portuguese slavery in Brazil was ostensibly the worst form of African slavery in the New World, there were many up risings . Did they ask for freedom or to return to Africa ? No, they wanted more time with their families, better quarters, their own land and crops, in short a bigger piece of the pie .If you are born into an agricultural society in a veritable endless wilderness, where you live off the bounty of the land  &mdash;    &mdash;   fishing,hunting, gathering and farming, then how do you define freedom anyway ?                                                         The brick slave quarters in South Carolina they showed on either A&E; or Discovery a while back, where the black Iowan re-enactor was seeking his roots ?,were by far nicer than the settlers houses on ST Simons Island,GA. And the houses on St Simons were occuppied by lawyers,doctors and politicians .The coquina foundations are still there .They are about the size of a small bathroom .Please, come down and see them.                                                            The south essentially was a mercantilist colony first of Britain and then New England .Everyone wanted her raw materials and ag products but that took labor and a lot of it . No other groups were more responsible for having brought the slaves in than the British and the New Englanders, do we let them off the hook ? What about Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, do we let them off the hook ?Do we let Black American slave owners off the hook? The planters were simply men who found their niche in the world they were born into and that does not make them greedy or evil anymore than were the northern industrialist . Even way back then it was money that made the world go round .                                                         For us (the whites ) allowing the African into our world has been a real tragedy, but it was an honest mistake . The biggest mistake has been placating and giving in to them since the end of WW2 . And now we are making the exact same mistake with our cheap south of the border labor . And in 100 years,they too will be demanding reparations .We just never learn .</p>

<p>In some cases, the men wanted darker women due to the fact that they felt the darker the woman the more wanton and sexually exciting she would be.</p>

<p>These women may not be light skinned, but they are not very dark either. They are brown skinned Black women and the ones you mentioned have very White looking feautres. </p>

<p>I am 67 year old White man. When I was in my early 20s, my grandfather told me and my older brother stories about how White men would routinely have sexual relationships with Black women. <br>
White men, not mulattos, or biracial Black men, although they probably did to. </p>
<p>In many cases it was done discreetly. - Out of town hotels, doctors offices, etc&hellip; but it was not unusual. The fact is that that relationships between White men and Black women have taken place since the founding of this nation. It is unfortunate but it is simply a fact of history.</p>
<p>We do oursleves no good by attempting to deny it or to pretend that it was a obscure, limited experience. </p>

<p>Agreed.  But they did not have many white women in their colonies.  The English came with their families;  the French and Spanish generally did not.   </p>
<p>The fact remains that their striving to approximate whiteness  <i>as much as possible  </i>shows that  <b>what white men REALLY wanted was white women </b>&hellip;  women of their own kind,  women who looked like themselves.  Stranded far from home in exotic places, they made do with what was locally available but, if given a choice, they would have preferred a white woman. </p>

<p>I agree with your post. The founders of plantations who brought in slaves to work them were not &#8220;evil&#8221; people. But they were naive people. They simply had no concept of the world as it would be today&hellip;. no more than  we can imagine what the world will be like in another two or three centuries;  nor do we realize the mistakes that we are making right now, for which our descendents will someday blame us.</p>
<p>Plantation owners were often the younger sons of aristocratic families who were ineligible to inherit and who had to go abroad to seek their fortunes and make new lives for themselves.   They were attempting to reproduce in America the same rural, feudal society that they had known at home in Europe.  It was the only world they knew, the only social system.  Lacking white peasants and servants, they brought in blacks instead to fill those roles. They had no idea where this would lead!  </p>
<p>No doubt they  (people like Jefferson) thought their idyllic feudal world would go on forever.  That was not to be!   Industrialization and the scientific revolution were coming and would sweep all that away; it would be &#8220;gone with the wind&#8221;.  They could never have foreseen the world of today.  It would have been unimaginable to them.</p>
