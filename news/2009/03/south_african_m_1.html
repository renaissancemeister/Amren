			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lesbians living in South Africa are being raped by men who believe it will &#8216;cure&rsquo;  them of their sexual orientation, a report has revealed.</p>
<p>Women are reporting a rising tide of brutal homophobic attacks and murders and the widespread use of &#8216;corrective&rsquo;  rape as a form of punishment.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned by international NGO ActionAid, called for South Africa&rsquo;s criminal justice system to recognise the rapes as hate crimes as police are reportedly failing to take action over the spiralling violence.</p>
<p>south africa</p>
<p>Horrific crimes against lesbians in South Africa are reportedly going unrecognised by the state and unpunished by the legal system</p>
<p>The extent of the brutality became clear when Eudy Simelane, former star of South Africa&rsquo;s national female football squad, became one of the victims last April.</p>
<p>Simelane, one of the first women to live openly as a lesbian and an equality rights campaigner, was gang-raped and beaten before being stabbed to death 25 times in the face, chest and legs.</p>
<p>Triangle, a gay rights organisation, said it deals with up to 10 new cases of &#8216;corrective rape&rsquo; every week.</p>
<p>Support groups claim an increasingly macho political environment led to inaction over attacks.</p>
<p>A statement released by South Africa&rsquo;s national prosecuting authority said: &#8216;While hate crimes  &mdash;  especially of a sexual nature  &mdash;  are rife, it is not something that the South African government has prioritised as a specific project.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Human rights and equality campaigners are hoping the reaction to Simelane&rsquo;s death and the trial of the three men accused of her rape and murder will help put an end to the attacks.</p>
<p>Laura Turquet, ActionAid&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s rights coordinator, said: &#8216;So-called  &#8220;corrective&#8221; rape is yet another grotesque manifestation of violence against  women, the most widespread human rights violation in the world today.</p>
<p>&#8216;These  crimes continue unabated and with impunity, while governments simply turn a  blind eye.&rsquo;<br>

<p>&#8220;Corrective rape,&#8221; huh. Here&rsquo;s a quote from the article   &mdash;   followed by a &#8220;corrective&#8221; from me: </p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;These crimes continue unabated and with impunity, while governments simply turn a blind eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
But as the notion of &#8220;corrective rape&#8221; is unknown anywhere but on The Dark Continent, it would be more accurate and informative to state: </p>
<p><br>
&lsquo;These crimes continue unabated and with impunity IN BLACK AFRICA, while governments IN BLACK AFRICA simply turn a blind eye.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, a krugerrand to a Krispy Kreme says that many of these men who are trying to rape the lesbianism out of women are having relationships with other men on the down low.</p>
<p>Predictably, human rights activists want the South African &ldquo;government&rdquo; (rimshot) to do something about it.  Two decades ago, they might have, because twenty years ago, South Africa had a white apartheid government that kept a lid on black crime.  These same human rights activists just couldn&rsquo;t wait to overthrow the white government, which eventually happened thanks to white treason and perfidy.  That opened the Pandora&rsquo;s Box of black crime.</p>

			<p>One would think that, considering the deference given to lesbians among leftists and their press, such stories would be widely published.  However, once again we see that race trumps gender in the list of leftist priorities.  Obama beat Clinton because black trumps female.  It is the same here.</p>

			<p>I suppose this is about as logical as selecting a virgin as a victim to cure your HIV.<br>
With black rapists, tortue and unnecessary &#8216;over the top&rsquo; violence seems to be part of their M.O.<br>
It&rsquo;s my hunch that the victims in this case happening to be gay, would just be a bonus to the rapists ego and their desire to inflict cruelty. (But the video link at the bottom of this post shows lesbians really are targeted).</p>
<p>I think that if you have a pulse you&rsquo;re a potential victim, just look at the stats for baby rape, 58 children and babies per day, or 1 rape every 26 seconds and one out of every three woman will be victimized this way in their lifetime. And this is in the most Aids affected country on earth. <br>

			<p>What we see in South Africa is just a preview of what is going to happen in the USA.</p>
<p>Bleeding heart liberal whites will place the blacks in power.  The first step has been taken with Hussein.</p>
<p>In time there will only be blacks in positions of power and authority.</p>
<p>Then the blacks will take back business, industry and farms.</p>
<p>Then there will be third world h*ll as we see it it South Africa.</p>
<p>Twenty years or so should be about enough to make every white person wish he were dead.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t they need some kind of &#8220;double-blind&#8221; study to determine if this treatment is effective or not? I can&rsquo;t seem to think up how one could devise a test strategy for that, but what percentage of recipients of this treatment are cured of this disease? Of course we will never know if the ones who are killed were cured. Kind of like when they used to throw witches in the water. The ones who sunk were innocent, and the ones who floated were quilty and promptly hung.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Women are reporting a rising tide of brutal homophobic attacks and murders and the widespread use of &#8216;corrective&rsquo;  rape as a form of punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>But black on white crime and murder are at epidemic proportions; however, since that involves whites and &#8220;corrective rape&#8221; involves a protected minority, the usual standards apply here:  Give the less numerous crimes a thorough round of publicity until the world is sick to death of hearing of it, while at the same time pretending that whites whine too much about getting what they deserve.</p>
<p>There now.  Problem solved.  That wasn&rsquo;t hard was it?  I mean it&rsquo;s just a matter of applying standard operating procedures there just as the MSM does here. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;this is one of the dykes pet topics. It is widely hoped by them that rape will turn a woman against men, giving them some sort of shot at you.</p>
<p>I just no longer believe everything I read or hear in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Honestly, it is their favorite subject when approaching any &#8220;het&#8221; to get a bead on where their &#8220;head is at&#8221; before they attack you with their heterophobia. This is the first warning signal in Minnesota at least.</p>
<p>Their hopes are so high in this department I have long suspected that it is what is really behind all the dangerous, stupid ideas they have put into practice such as co-ed dorms with co-ed bathrooms&hellip;introducing felons into the environment with college &#8220;athletics&#8221; departments. I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Reminding women of ugly subjects like this is another way of programming women to fear men&hellip;</p>
<p>And therefore, I don&rsquo;t trust anything coming from a gay rights organization. When I was at the U of M the Lesbian/agitators/Marxist/Professors came right out and said that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if what a woman claims is false, as long as they have the right intentions. The ends justify the means. In other words, they are liars. Their mentality is no different than the blacks.</p>

<p>Actually, I have heard of this in South Africa, (black) men raping women to &#8220;cure&#8221; them of lesbianism. I find this hardly surprising coming from people who rape babies to &#8220;cure&#8221; themselves of AIDS.<br>

			<p>I will read what everyone else here has said after I get off work.  I do want to say that as a lesbian myself I know what a large percentage of the lesbian population has been sexually abused by men.  I don&rsquo;t know whether there is a connection or it is just coincidence, but there goes the rape for the cure theory.</p>

			<p>How do the rapists know the women are lesbians?  Sounds like how the Africans accuse people of witchcraft when they want to kill them and take over their homes and other property.</p>
<p>Black American rapists justify rape of white women because of slavery.  They justify rape of black women because of black women&rsquo;s emasculating aggressive attitudes.  They justify rape on the grounds that they have needs.</p>
<p>The needs are partly sexual and partly the inherent need of men with too much testorone and too low an IQ to commit violence on helpless, smaller people.</p>
<p>According to the American Nurse&rsquo;s association, murder by their partners is the 5th biggest cause of death for black women.  And black men have just as high a rate of murdering white women as they do black women.</p>

<p>I agree.  Here in California the gays on a crusade to stop people from using the word Gay because it is now derogatory and discriminatory.  But wasn&rsquo;t it just about 15 years ago that the taxpayer funded gay organizations officially renamed themselves gay instead of homosexual?  Now it&rsquo;s a slur against them.</p>
<p>Rape is endemic in S. Africa.  I agree that the gay and other activists are falsly claiming that lesbians are targetted.</p>
<p>Having been a Probation Officer who actually had most of the rapists in the county on my case load, I can tell you that black rapists rape the first female that comes along, 8 months to 80 years.</p>
<p>And once again, although blacks have never been more than 8 percent of my county&rsquo;s population, they commit about 99 percent of my county&rsquo;s rapes.</p>
<p>In fact, in 27 years of dealing with my county&rsquo;s rapists, I cannot remember one, not one who was any other race than black.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s new here? Don&rsquo;t black males ALWAYS do most of their thinking with their sex organ? A funny sidenote is that the MYTH of them being so much DIFFERENT is just that A MYTH, my uncle is a Urologist and he says he laughs at all the reasons they can come up with for keeping their secret, SECRET. I can tell the reader how to make a trip to Africa without ever leaving the United States&hellip; Detroit isn&rsquo;t that far away?</p>

			<p>Another &#8220;benefit&#8221; of black majority rule in Africa.</p>
<p>But this issue ought to be explored more. It does seem to have the taint of a PC agenda, which uses hysteria over rape to mobilize support for feminism and against men.</p>

I have spoken with many former South African whites, and they all agree that it was a great place to live until the recent past.  </p>

<p>I like how in your bottom video, a few minutes in. You can hear the interviewed black African say that the lesbians are simply &#8220;borrowing&#8221; the idea of homosexuality from &#8220;the whites&#8221;. He actually believes whites caused them to be gay.</p>
<p>Good gracious, their lack of logic continues to surprise me. I&rsquo;d be laughing if our brethren weren&rsquo;t busily shoveling away our money to help these people out. </p>

			<p>  Weren&rsquo;t South African blacks raping virgins (some even infants) to cure themselves of AIDS? Somehow using sexual violence to &#8220;cure&#8221; lesbians of their sexual preferences seems barbaric and idiotic in the extreme.</p>

<p>I worked with South African white men in Iraq and Kuwait, they had all moved their families out of SA and would never go back. The opinion was that Iraq (in &#8216;05 and &#8216;06!!) was safer!!!</p>
