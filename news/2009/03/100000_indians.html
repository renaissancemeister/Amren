<h1>100,000 Indians Will Return From US in Next 3-5 Years</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Birmingham (Alabama) Star, March 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As many as 100,000 Indians and an equal number of Chinese will return to their native countries in the next three to five years, a move that will greatly boost their economies and undermine technological innovation in America, a new US study warns.</p>
<p>The study on immigration by a team at Duke, Harvard and Berkeley universities led by Vivek Wadhwa, an Indian-American technology entrepreneur turned academic, says &#8216;America&rsquo;s loss is the world&rsquo;s gain&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are no hard numbers available on how many have returned, but anecdotal evidence shows that this is in the tens of thousands, says Wadhwa, executive-in-residence for the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University and fellow at the Labour and Worklife Programme at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>&#8216;With the economic downturn, my guess is that we&rsquo;ll have over 100,000 Indians and as many Chinese return home over the next three-five years,&rsquo; says Wadhwa. &#8216;This flood of western educated and skilled talent will greatly boost the economies of India and China and strengthen their competitiveness.</p>
<p>&#8216;India is already becoming a global hub for R&D.; This will allow it to branch into many new areas and will accelerate the trend,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>&#8216;The US has always had the luxury of being arrogant about immigration because it has been the strongest magnet for the world&rsquo;s best and brightest,&rsquo; but as the study shows &#8216;there are other strong magnets now&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are effectively exporting our economic stimulus. Policies like those which the US just enacted which prevents some banks from hiring foreign workers will have the opposite effect from what they intended  &mdash;  they will send jobs abroad and scare away top talent,&rsquo; Wadhwa said.</p>
<p>The study released Monday Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, based in Kansas City, Montana, indicates placing limits on foreign workers in the US is not the answer to America&rsquo;s rising unemployment rate and may undermine efforts to spur technological innovation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two-year study covered 1,203 Indian and Chinese subjects who had studied or worked in the US for a year or more before returning home.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Vivek Wadhwa, Anna Lee Saxenian, Richard B. Freeman, and Gary Gereffi, Social Science Research Network, March 2, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Immigrants have historically provided one of America&rsquo;s greatest competitive advantages. They have come to the United States largely to work and have played a major role in the country&rsquo;s recent growth. Between 1990 and 2007, the proportion of immigrants in the U.S. labor force increased from 9.3 percent to 15.7 percent. Approximately 45 percent of the growth of the work force over this period consisted of immigrants. Moreover, a large and growing proportion of immigrants come with high levels of education and skill. They have contributed disproportionately in the most dynamic part of the U.S. economy  &mdash;  the high-tech sector. Immigrants have co-founded firms such as Google, Intel, eBay, and Yahoo. And immigrant inventors contributed to more than a quarter of U.S. global patent applications.</p>
<p>Since even before the 2008 financial and economic crisis, some observers have noted that a substantial number of highly skilled immigrants have started returning to their home countries, including persons from low-income countries like India and China who have historically tended to stay permanently in the United States. These returnees contributed to the tech boom in those countries and arguably spurred the growth of outsourcing of back-office processes as well as of research and development.</p>
<p>Who are these returnees? What motivated their decision to leave the United States? How have they fared since returning?</p>
<p>This paper attempts to answer these questions through a survey of 1,203 Indian and Chinese immigrants who had worked or received their education in the United States and returned to their home country.</p>
<p>We find that, though restrictive immigration policies caused some returnees to depart the United States, the most significant factors in the decision to return home were career opportunities, family ties, and quality of life.</p>

			<p>Well, when you have scientists driving trucks and taxi cabs, and US graduates of tech programs in CS and engineering unable to find jobs, it means there is NO WORK for foreigners. I just wish they would all leave enmasse NOW so Americans could get employment NOW.</p>

			<p>Excellent news!  This means I might have a chance of working as a research chemist again, before I turn 50.</p>
<p>I think if the corporate big-shots want to hire Indians and not Americans, they should be free to do so, but they should be forced to do it in India, and they and their families should be forced to live there as well.  If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to hire Americans, I don&rsquo;t want him living in my country.</p>
<p>As for this &#8220;undermining&#8221; technological innovation in the United States, just who do the greedy idiots think was doing this sort of work 20 years ago?  </p>

			<p>The underlying bold-faced  lie is this:without LEGAL asian immigrants America could not have been a technological giant.</p>
<p>The experiment-an America with a very small asian population- has already been performed. Native Born White Americans were much better off economically. Native Born White America put around ten Native born White Males on the moon. And this is just a very short lists of enormous technoligical accomplishments that came from an America where the White Americans were  90 percent of the American population.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans were forced by the traitors in the Republican and Democratic parties to subsidize the education and training of the youth of one of America&rsquo;s major military and economic competitors-China. And in forcing Native Born White Americans to do this, wiped out who knows how many years of engineering experience that resides in the collective brains of Native Born White America. And if you include the number of Native Born White Americans who could could have been invested in and developed for careers in engineering and the sciences&hellip;the amount of engineering experince wiped out in Native Born White America..without a doubt&hellip;. is staggering.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americans survive all the years when the asian population was tiny? Quite well thank you.</p>
<p>The Republican party is dedicated to the demographic and racial annihilation of Native Born White Americans within the borders of America. Republican politicians are much greater threat to the survival of Native Born White America within the borders of America than AL Queda. Al Queda just wants America out of the middle east. The Republican party wants to dispossess Native White Americans of the nation they founded and created!!!!If you vote for the Republican party, you cast a vote for the death of Native Born White America. Obviously this is not an endorsement of the Democratic party.<br>

			<p>Let the Chinese and Indian techies go, and take all their less talented relatives with them.  If we could then get rid of the Mexicans and Africans and other unwanted foreigners that drag our society down, we could have the public schools back up to where they were in the 50s, and train our own technical people.</p>

			<p><i>&hellip;an Indian-American technology entrepreneur turned academic, says &lsquo;America&rsquo;s loss is the world&rsquo;s gain&rsquo;.</i></p>
<p>So what is this guy saying   &mdash;   that we should continue to raid India and China for their &#8220;best and brightest,&#8221; even if it undermines their economies?  Is the goal here to increase our GDP and productivity at their expense?  Given that the USA has a per capita GDP almost 20 times that of India, and given the unemployment rate here, isn&rsquo;t this pretty much uniformly good news?</p>
<p>One wonders if Mr. Wadhwa is torn between conflicting loyalties to his native land and to increasing the influence of his countrymen in the United States.<br>

			<p>Vivek Wadwa keeps referring to &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. Yet, H1B and L1 are &#8220;temporary NON-IMMIGRANT&#8221; visas, so how can holders of these visas possibly be &#8220;immigrants&#8221;?</p>
<p>Seems to me that dismissing the pernicious socio-economic effects on Americans by outsourcing/H1/L1 while chanting &#8220;Globalization&#8221; is as racist as it gets.</p>
<p>Immigration Voice is a collection of mostly Indian H1B types organized to lobby for &hellip;more H1Bs and L1s. Even immigration voice had a thread (now deleted) running casting doubt on 100,000 H1Bs leaving anytime soon. In any event, it is worth taking a look at the outrageous goals of this trojan horse. </p>
<p>https://immigrationvoice.org/</p>
<p>315,000 L1 + 85,000 H1 &#8220;temporary NON-IMMIGRANT&#8221; visas are being issued annually-not counting exemptions as universities, &#8220;research institutions&#8221;, &#8220;non-profits&#8221; others are exempt from H1 quotas. L1 visas are unlimited. Simply put, this is unsustainable as the economy crashes. That&rsquo;s why we are seeing this propaganda blitz by the media titans-thank GOD the internet loosens their grip on the dissemination of information by the day.</p>
<p>https://www.infoworld.com/article/07/12/28/52FE-underreported-visas_1.html</p>
<p>Along with Obamas planned amnesty for illegals in the midst of an economic collapse, the push is on to drive the final nail in the coffin of white America.</p>
<p>THEY WILL ONLY SUCCEED IN WAKING UP OUR BRETHREN!</p>
<p>Bottom line; None of this would be happening if the South had won the war&hellip;</p>

<p>Is this a fancy way of saying these foreigners are simply industrial/technology spies? Because that&rsquo;s what it amounts to. I keep hearing about all this presumed talent in Chinese, Indians and Pakistanis. Which begs the question: Why did only American technology give us computers and other break-through inventions since WWII? Allow me to suggest there&rsquo;s a vast difference between an invention, and merely improvements thereafter. Let something equivalent to the invention of computers emanate from China or any other Asian country, and I&rsquo;ll concede to being wrong in seeing these people as imitators and copiers rather than for original creative thinking.</p>
<p>The pride China, Pakistan and India have in their nuclear weapons, for example. With probably the majority of that technology STOLEN from America. </p>

<p>Yes, here&rsquo;s a quality of life we&rsquo;d all be anxious to return to!</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;As currently designed, India&rsquo;s sewer system is actually a pathogen-dispersal system. It takes a small quantity of contaminated material and uses it to make vast quantities of water unfit for human use, often simply discharging it into nearby rivers or streams. Narain says both &#8216;our rivers and our children are dying.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>As someone else said, it is a total myth that we need these immigrants from asia. Asian immigrants hurt america because they drive down wages and take jobs. They see america as a paycheck, most have no loyalty. They help their own countries, our competitors, by technology they learned here. I blame insanely greedy corporate white america and our enabling white politicians for this. They want to sell america down the river for cheap labor. A better idea would be to hire our own people for all of these tech jobs etc. and investing in our own young people and their education. A lot more young americans will go into these tech and other jobs and will be more creative if their are jobs and a decent paycheck to be had but they won&rsquo;t if they can&rsquo;t find work because of all these asians. </p>

<p>I accept your challenge.</p>
<p>The Chinese have come up with a loudspeaker using nanotechnology that does not use mechanical vibrations to create sound. Don&rsquo;t believe me?</p>
<p>https://blogs.physicstoday.org/update/acoustics/</p>
<p>Nanotube loudspeakers</p>
<p>&#8220;They showed that a thin film of nanotubes can reproduce sounds over a wide frequency range  &mdash;  including the full human audible range  &mdash;  with high sound pressure level, low total harmonic distortion, and no magnets. The team created the film by drawing nanotubes from a so-called superaligned array grown on a wafer, a technique the group introduced six years ago (see also PHYSICS TODAY, October 2005, page 23). The resulting film, only tens of nanometers thick but up to 10 cm wide, is transparent and has a nearly purely resistive impedance. When electrodes are placed along its ends and an alternating current is applied, the film produces clear tones that can be as loud as a conventional speaker. </p>
<p>&#8220;The researchers attribute the sound generation not to vibration but to a thermoacoustic effect first proposed nearly a century ago: Thanks to the nanotube film&rsquo;s extremely low heat capacity per unit area, changes in the current flowing through the film are reflected in the film&rsquo;s temperature, and those temperature changes excite pressure waves in the surrounding air. </p>

<p>Nothing to ponder; what the Chinese have created is not adaption, it is the creation of a sound producing machine based on a technique of &#8220;drawing nanotubes from a so-called superaligned array grown on a wafer, a technique the group introduced six years ago.&#8221; In other words, the device they invented to produce sound was itself derived from a technique they developed to create nanotube arrays. A creation based on a prior Chinese INVENTION.<br>

			<p>Why let the asian supremacists post their exaggerations and lies here? They can do that in the MSM and most other PC cheerleading zones, so let them do it in those locales. I for one doubt this story about Indians is true. It&rsquo;s most likely as big a lie as the stories of Mexicans moving back to Mexico because of the lack of work in the US. No, they aren&rsquo;t. The Mexicans enjoy front of the line free social service handouts with no questions asked. Asians, whether E. Asians or Indians get first dib on jobs merely for being non-whites. We have to hear about their brilliance and inventiveness yet at the same time these people are the leaders in Industrial espionage, patent theft, intellectual property theft and more. I really do wish they would go back to their own lands. But they know they can&rsquo;t succeed because their own peoples don&rsquo;t create societies that function as well as those in the West. If the Chinese, Indians et al had had no contact the last couple of hundred years we all know where they&rsquo;d be. The same place they were a couple of hundred years ago. This isn&rsquo;t even arguable.</p>

			<p>FWIW, and to add to my former post, I have no problem encouraging these scientists and engineers to come here. However&hellip;the H1b/tech visa issue has now become tied to overall immigration numbers. Over 1.5 million immigrants each and every year, most of them having nothing to do with tech. On average, in fact, far less educated (and educable) than Americans. Look at California&rsquo;s slide into the abyss. Look at California&rsquo;s NAEP scores.</p>
<p>If tech businesses want to keep the doors open to high-skilled labor, it is in their best ineterests to favor enforcement and to oppose amnesty and chain migration; as well as opposing those businesses (Wipro, etc.) who only send workers here to increase their outsourcing business.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The researchers attribute the sound generation not to vibration but to a thermoacoustic effect first proposed nearly a century ago&#8221; </p>
<p>The thermoacoustic effect was first described in 1880 by Alexander Graham Bell, who observed sound emanating from a sheet of rubber that was being illuminated by an intermittent beam of sun light. </p>
<p>In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet Journal of Physical Chemistry.[86] This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists&rsquo; access to Soviet press was limited during the Cold War. </p>
<p>In 1987, Howard G. Tennent of Hyperion Catalysis was issued a U.S. patent for the production of &#8220;cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils&#8221; with a &#8220;constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70 nanometers&hellip;, length 10² times the diameter, and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sounds like a Chinese adaptation to me.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s something else to ponder.</p>
<p>The recent breakthroughs at the University of Cincinnati and CVD Equipment Corporation (of Ronkonkoma, New York), have led to the growth of large carbon nanotube arrays. While individual carbon nanotubes are only 20 billionths of a meter in diameter, the array of carbon nanotubes grow as millimeter-long dense forests on centimeter-wide substrates. </p>
<p>Years of research by UC&rsquo;s Shanov, Schulz and students Andrew Gorton and Yun YeoHeung led to the invention of the method for growing the large nanotube arrays. Researchers and engineers at CVD Equipment Corporation developed and built the equipment used to grow the large carbon nanotube arrays.</p>
<p>This took place in 2006 and notice the Chinese guy/spy. This was an American University and a American Company! Wow,what inovators the Chinese are! First spaghetti and now carbon nanotube arrays. What will they &#8220;think&#8221; of next. I feel sooo inferior being a dumb old American white guy.<br>

<p>These have been around commercially for 40 years but they are expensive.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t dismiss the Asians that simply. They are doing basic science now as Japan does. The Japanese do invent. There is no reason to believe the Chinese and Asians would produce completely nevel technology, but we don&rsquo;t need them in our country to survive and proper.</p>

			<p>TO add one point, lets not pump our chests out on things that we call AMERICAN INVENTIONS that are also just advances in technology. Gear driven special purpose computers had existed for thousands of years. The Antikythera Mechanism from Greece, artillery calculators on ships are all examples of this.</p>
<p>From computability theory one has to show that something is Turing computable. Alan Turing was a Brit who worked at Blechley Park countering the Gernam enigma machine. He built an electronic computer to do the hunting for likely code keys.There was an attempt to build a British general purpose machine about the same time as was done in the US, it just lost out in the commerce game, I believe.</p>
<p>John von Neumann was a captured German who came up with an idea for what we like to think is the basic architechture of the electronic computer.<br>

<p>Get real. A Chinse adapation of WHAT? The Chinese have developed a TRANSPARENT membrane of carbon nanotubes that are &#8220;tens of nanometers thick.&#8221; This is like the Star Trek movie where Sulu tells the American how to make &#8220;transparent Aluminum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This took place in 2006 and notice the Chinese guy/spy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, a gratitous insult against a Chinese person simply because they aren&rsquo;t white.</p>
<p>Note that the Chinese used a technique THEY developed SIX years ago, which would be 2002, well before your 2006 date. Other people were also creating nanotube items before your 2006 date ( <a href="https://www.physorg.com/news5890.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.physorg.com/news5890.html</a> - &#8220;Researchers produce strong, transparent carbon nanotube sheets&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually the Chinese invention just seems to be an adaptation of nanotube technology to an older but existant system of speaker technology - electrostatic speakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly you misunderstand what the Chinese have invented. An electrostatic speaker VIBRATES mechanically to create pressure waves. The Chinese invention doesn&rsquo;t. There have been loudspeakers that don&rsquo;t have moving mechanical parts e.g. loudspeakers that used an ionized plasma in which a high voltage analog signal was passed through, but clearly this Chinese device doesn&rsquo;t do that. A commercial loudspeaker using Argon gas was sold in the past. You can create such a device using a gas flame and an audio amplifier feeding a high voltage transformer with electrodes in the gas flame.</p>

<p>Only if the underlying technology was NOT the work of Whites! What can&rsquo;t you understand about the difference between improvements, adaptions and ORIGINAL work? Surely steam power was eventually prevalent in China, India, Japan and other oriental countries. But steam power was NOT INVENTED (invented meaning the experimentation and work of building a machine to make use of the natural power inherent in steam) by Orientals.</p>
<p>Seriously, &#8220;anonymous&#8221;, what can&rsquo;t you understand between taking existing technology to new heights, versus creating new knowledge and developing it into subsequent technology?</p>
<p>To Posted by Mark in LA&hellip; you&rsquo;re missing the whole point! Those Greeks were White Europeans by definition. Mechanical versus cybernetic computers is a moot point. BOTH, by definition are computers. My point was they were both the product of Europeans or their White European-American descendants.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;ll never get the Asian Supremacists to admit to Asians using white ideas and inventions, never mind stealing ideas. What people don&rsquo;t understand is that these cultures see it as OK to steal someone else&rsquo;s ideas and claim them as their own. They believe that just doing the research to &#8220;find&#8221; the idea shows inventiveness. It&rsquo;s a whole different mindset.</p>

			<p>None-Whites meaning Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Indians, Pakistans, even Blacks, apparently have a collective inferiority complex based on the undeniable truth that by far the greatest part of human knowledge in the sciences, medicine, mathematics, engineering, astronomy, etc. were made by Whites in Europe or America over the centuries.</p>
<p>The multitude of inventions making use of that learning and knowledge amassed by Whites, were also almost entirely the work of White engineers, experimenters, tinkerers and scientists.</p>
<p>Were this not the case, there would have been little or no need for knowledge and technology transfer from White nations to the Orient. That the aforementioned nations would have developed technology in parallel with that in Europe and the Americas   &mdash;   BY THEIR OWN EFFORT. (Without having to &#8216;borrow&rsquo; from Whites.)</p>
<p>That Asians improved and added to inventions and technology originating in America (or Europe) is laudable but not the point. The point being the Asiand did not INVENT on the massive scale White people did. It might also be added Whites freely shared the technology as it became available, with other racial groups. (No, of course we are not talking about nuclear defense technology which China has been STEALING from the West since the 1950s.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Anonymous&#8221; seems either a bit piqued at my pointing this out earlier or can&rsquo;t face the truth we Whites truly do (collectively) deserve far more credit than he is willing to acknowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to ponder; what the Chinese have created is not adaption, it is the creation of a sound producing machine based on a technique of &ldquo;drawing nanotubes from a so-called superaligned array grown on a wafer, a technique the group introduced six years ago.&rdquo; In other words, the device they invented to produce sound was itself derived from a technique they developed to create nanotube arrays. A creation based on a prior Chinese INVENTION.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong Anonymous, here is the foundations of nanotechnology, as recorded by that ever so biased and pro-white source Wikipedia:<br>
 </p>
<p>&#8220;The first use of the concepts in &#8216;nano-technology&rsquo; (but predating use of that name) was in &#8216;There&rsquo;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,&rsquo; a talk given by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959. Feynman described a process by which the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so on down to the needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, surface tension and Van der Waals attraction would become more important, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology</a></p>
<p>Moreover, I will ask again: where do &#8220;Chinese&#8221; loudspeakers factor into all of this?</p>
<p>Sorry, but you are the one demanding concessions; thus, you need to make your case solidly and by 100%.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, perhaps a concession from you is in order? </p>

<p>You guys never cease repeating this line of argument, so, let&rsquo;s have this wonderful quote from &#8220;Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, a Parisian typesetter and tinkerer who went to his grave convinced that credit for his breakthroughs had been improperly bestowed on Edison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the rights of the discoverer versus the improver?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Come, Parisians, don&rsquo;t let them take our prize&#8221;</p>
<p>You see, Scott was a Frenchman who couldn&rsquo;t stomach an American, Edison, getting credit for creating the phonograph. Substitute &#8220;White&#8221; for &#8220;Parisians&#8221; and we got EXACLTY what amrenners have been arguing for years: Whites invented everything and Asians merely make improvements.</p>

<p>John P.M., it should be clear from my writing that I neither implicitly or explicitly claimed the Chinese had anything to do with the invention of nanotechnology. However, if we want to go the wikipedia route for Fun Facts, &#8220;The existence of C60 was predicted by Eiji Osawa of Toyohashi University of Technology in a Japanese magazine[4] in 1970. He noticed that the structure of a corannulene molecule was a subset of a soccer-ball shape, and he made the hypothesis that a full ball shape could also exist. His idea was reported in Japanese magazines, but did not reach Europe or America.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it appears that uncreative Asian minds can actually be ahead of the out-of-the-box thinking Caucasian minds.</p>

<p>In order to better understand the amren mindset, allow me to present a hypothetical situation based on the current argument.</p>
<p>The Chinese have invented a loudspeaker using nanotechnology. I am amazed and want to duplicate their results with something else. I see that a material called &#8220;aerogels&#8221; exists which might prove useful. I look at wikipedia ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel</a> ) and am amazed to see that there is apparently a nanotechology carbon aerogel that is manufactured currently for commercial applications. Perhaps they are used by Asians to make Supercapitors?  Suppose I take this material, peel off a layer using scotch tape, and run audio through it, and it produces sound.</p>
<p>Invention or adaption? Or does that depend if I&rsquo;m White or not?</p>

<p>Wrong again Anonymous, you are explicitly stating (through the sloppiness of your own writing style, and truculence in this debate) that the Chinese invented the loudspeaker and nanotechnology in your original post to Fed Up. When you note:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese have come up with a loudspeaker using nanotechnology that does not use mechanical vibrations to create sound. Don&rsquo;t believe me?</p>
<p>https://blogs.physicstoday.org/update/acoustics/ &#8220;</p>
<p>You offer no other background information and this explicitly indicates, that you would have us all believe that they &#8220;invented&#8221; these technologies, not adapted them. Moreover, you compound the weaknesses in your own arguments, by citing Japanese work on this topic from 1970 (be it from Wikipedia or any other source) when I demonstrated that nanotechnology has its roots in the USA from the year 1959, through the theoretical work of Richard Feynman. </p>
<p>This would be like me claiming that Relativity Theory and subsequently applied nuclear physics, were totally an American invention of 1945 because we exploded an atomic bomb that year. </p>
<p>With that in mind:  </p>
<p>&#8220;So it appears that uncreative Asian minds can actually be ahead of the out-of-the-box thinking Caucasian minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite!</p>
<p>Particularly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, right?</p>
<p><br>
Well, I guess so, using your &#8220;hypothetical&#8221; logic:</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to better understand the amren mindset, allow me to present a hypothetical situation based on the current argument&hellip;Invention or adaption? Or does that depend if I&rsquo;m White or not?</p>
<p>Of course not, but where the foundations are created does; in this argument, it was by a Caucasian and not an Asian!</p>

<p>The guy was right. They won&rsquo;t admit it. This thread is proof. We have &#8220;anonymous&#8221; actually attempting to hijack the thread and keep everyone&rsquo;s attention off the actual topic, mainly the MSM spreading more lies about another bunch of non-whites supposedly going back to where they belong. In reality, it won&rsquo;t happen until they&rsquo;re kicked out.</p>
<p>Inventions? No one says whites have invented everything. Asians have made some breakthroughs of course. But whites have invented far more than Asians despite being vastly outnumbered by Asians. Asians hate that fact being brought up. It&rsquo;s possible Asians could pass up whites the way the schools are being dumbed down in the US and Europe by the Marxists, but more likely things aren&rsquo;t going to stay the same much longer. The big blow up is getting close. </p>
