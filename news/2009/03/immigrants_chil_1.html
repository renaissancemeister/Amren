<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Katie Xiao emigrated from China when she was 4 and always thought of herself as Americanized  &mdash;  until she started dating.</p>
<p>Subtle cultural clashes with Caucasian or Latino boyfriends led to unhappy breakups. It made her realize she&rsquo;s more Chinese than she thought. Now she wants to meet a man of Asian descent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But scholars delving into the U.S. Census have found a surprising converse trend. Although interracial marriages overall have increased, the rate of Hispanics and Asians marrying partners of other races declined in the past two decades. This suggests that the growing number of immigrants is having a profound effect on coupling, they say.</p>
<p>The number of native- and foreign-born people marrying outside their race fell from 27 to 20 percent for Hispanics and 42 to 33 percent for Asians from 1990 to 2000, according to Ohio State University sociologist Zhenchao Qian, who co-authored a study on the subject. The downward trend continued through last year, Qian said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Increasingly, singles are turning to a growing number of niche dating sites on the Internet, such as http://Shaadi.com and http://Persiansingles.com. Locally, one of the largest social networking groups, Professionals in the City, has expanded its repertoire of lectures and wine-tastings over the past year to include &#8220;speed dating&#8221; nights for people of Asian, Latino or South Asian descent.</p>
<p>Michael Karlan, Professionals&rsquo; president, said targeting ethnic groups makes sense in the Washington area, which has more than 1 million immigrants. He teamed with the local South Asian networking group NetSAP for a recent event at Gua-Rapo in Arlington that was a noisy sellout with more than 90 attendees.</p>
<p>The 20- and 30-somethings drawn to these events say they have a deep yearning to connect with someone who shares their roots, yet they are conflicted about it. As children, they felt divided loyalties, growing up with one foot in their parents&rsquo; home country, the other in the United States. Now, as adults, they wonder: Would I be happy with someone as American as I am, or a recent immigrant?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers spent a decade following 3,300 children of immigrants in the New York region as they navigated adulthood, which led to a study published last year called &#8220;Inheriting the City: The Children of Immigrants Come of Age.&#8221; They followed both the &#8220;second generation&#8221; children born in the United States and the &#8220;1.5 generation&#8221;  &mdash;  children of immigrants who came as youngsters  &mdash;  who were Dominican, Chinese, Russian Jews, South Americans and West Indians.</p>
<p>Researchers found that their subjects were constantly struggling with the desire to be open to people of all backgrounds vs. family expectations, and their own desires to sustain their culture. Most paired with others who shared similar racial or language backgrounds.</p>

			<p>I remember for years the neoconservatives, at least as far back as the 1980s, said we had nothing to worry about when it came to mass immigration because all these immigrants were quickly assimilating.  As proof, they would often point to the intermarriage rates of whites with Asians and Hispanics.  Never mind the rightness or wrongness of this, the implication from the neoconservatives of all this was that these tiny minorities would soon be quickly absorbed by the huge white population.  Now that this is clearly not happening, what is the latest neoconservative   &mdash;   and conservative   &mdash;   argument for continued mass immigration, I wonder?</p>

			<p>Whites would do well to follow their example.  Nonwhites have plenty to spare, whereas whites are a steadily shrinking minority globally.  </p>

<p>The figures just may be more accurate. It could be there are so many of them living in the states now &#8216;foreign bride syndrom&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t skew the numbers so badly.</p>

			<p><i>When they have the option, Asians and Hispanics marry within their race.</i></p>
<p>Good. Interbreeding is one of the most successful ways of one nation to infiltrate another.</p>
<p>Think of it: if it weren&rsquo;t for interbreeding, the U.S. would not have a (patrially) black president.</p>

			<p>Gee&hellip;how HEARTRENDING!&hellip;I wonder how WHITES would be JUDGED as RACIST if THEY felt and did the same?</p>

<p>UNFORTUNATELY&hellip;WHITES haven&rsquo;t decided to do the SAME!&hellip;WE WHITES need to WAKE UP and FOLLOW SUIT!&hellip;for while Asians and Hispanics are  keeping THEIR races PURE&hellip;WHITES are DILUTING&hellip;THEIRS!</p>
<p><br/>

<p>I wonder how ACCEPTABLE it would be if Professionals in the City,were to expand its repertoire of lectures and wine-tastings to include &ldquo;speed dating&rdquo; nights for CAUCASIAN people?<br/>

<p>Well&hellip;since WHITES are part of that &#8220;diversity&#8221;&hellip;they should be &#8220;targeting&#8221; WHITES as well!</p>

<p>So&hellip;what if these 20- and 30-somethings were to say that they have a deep yearning to connect with someone who shares their roots, yet they are conflicted about it. As children, they felt divided loyalties, growing up with one foot in their WHITE parents&rsquo; home&hellip;the other  being PUSHED into DIVERSITY and POLITICAL CORRECTNES. Now, as adults, they wonder: Would I be happy with someone as WHITE as I am, or a person of color?</p>
