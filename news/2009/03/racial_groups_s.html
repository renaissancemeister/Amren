			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Toone, Augusta Chronicle, March 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Augusta-based Web site that promotes white supremacy, and is run by an organization considered to be a hate group by a national organization that tracks such sets, has seen an increase in traffic since the election of America&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>Louis Andrews, president of the National Policy Institute, a &#8220;pro-white&#8221; Web site where individuals can purchase reading materials on the costliness of diversity and on the intelligence levels of blacks and whites, said his site has had a 20 percent increase in traffic over the past few months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>National Policy Institute is one of three local organizations that the <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> labels as a hate group promoting racial supremacy, said Heidi Beirich, a spokeswoman for the law center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Concerns about immigration and the flagging economy have influenced interest in these organizations, Ms. Beirich said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two other local organizations, the New Black Panthers Party and the League of the South, are also listed as hate groups by the law center.</p>
<p>Bobby Price, chairman of Augusta&rsquo;s New Black Panthers Party, said the black nationalist organization formed in 1998 as a response to hate groups. He said the group, which opened an Augusta chapter in 2002, has not seen much growth because of the moderate views of most blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The League of the South promotes states&rsquo; rights and Anglo-Celtic culture in the South, said Ray McBerry, chairman of the Georgia chapter. Membership has grown over the past several months, but it has little to do with the president, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law center has not received any reports of violence from these organizations.</p>

I hope this web site is not playing the &#8220;illegal immigration bad,legal immigration good&#8221; silly game. Nothing about LEGAL immigration on the web site. Post -1965 LEGAL immigration is as much of a threat to Native Born White Americans as post-1965 illegal immigration.</p>

			<p>How could a newspaper possibly use the Southern Poverty Law Center as a reliable source? The SPLC is not credible: it selectivey chooses who to label as a hate group and deliberately picks pro-white organizations (the non-white organizations they label as &#8220;hate-groups&#8221; are done solely for token purposes so as to not look so biased, though they fail). Furthermore, the SPLC has a tendency to label anything or anyone as &#8220;hate&#8221; for merely disagreeing with their viewpoints, not because those groups or individuals truely possess a virulent hatred.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the SPLC is an utter joke. No person with the slightest amount of intellectual deceny can take them seriously.</p>

			<p>I would have thought that the National Policy Institute&rsquo;s web site would have seen an increase in activity of 20,000% since the election.  I see whitey is really slow in waking up.  It must be the intoxicating affect of diversity which is similar to that of methane gas.<br>

			<p>To toot my own horn, you see the NPI logo on the upper left of the front of AR&rsquo;s home page, with the tagline &#8220;The Right&rsquo;s Answer to the SPLC.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s on the NPI&rsquo;s own homepage, and the NPI got that from yours truly, as I said that on my blog on July 21, 2007 when the NPI came onto my radar screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://countenance.wordpress.com/2007/07/21/new-to-the-blogroll-31/" rel="nofollow">https://countenance.wordpress.com/2007/07/21/new-to-the-blogroll-31/</a></p>
<p>Really, the right needs its own SPLC, in that it needs someone who will say things about left wing extremists that go right up to the edge of libel without actually being libelous, to go on and on in a nearly paranoid fashion about the &#8220;links&#8221; (using a specious definition of the term) between one left wing extremist (read: the entire left wing) group and individual and another.  The NPI comes closest to that.  The big hangup in precluding what I really want is that there aren&rsquo;t a base of rich right-wingers hiding under their beds worrying about a vast left-wing conspiracy that&rsquo;s out to get them.</p>

<p>An obvious point may be missed by many readers. There is actually a fourth &#8216;hate&rsquo; group in the area&hellip;the SPLC themselves. They try to restrict the freedom of expression of others.</p>

			<p><i>An Augusta-based Web site that promotes white supremacy, and is run by an organization considered to be a hate group by a national organization that tracks such sets, has seen an increase in traffic since the election of America&rsquo;s first black president.</i></p>
<p>Better call on Obama&rsquo;s dream-team to cook up the &#8220;2009 Internet Hate Act&#8221; - wouldn&rsquo;t want those nasty <i>RACISTS!</i> giving white Americans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime" rel="nofollow">thoughts <i>we</i> do not approve of!</a></p>
<p><i>Louis Andrews, president of the National Policy Institute, a &ldquo;pro-white&rdquo; Web site where individuals can purchase reading materials on the costliness of diversity and on the intelligence levels of blacks and whites, said his site has had a 20 percent increase in traffic over the past few months.</i></p>
<p>Even the most &#8220;liberal&#8221; whites race-wise start to get skeptical of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; when woking class wages are lowered by Third-World immigration of a historically unprecedented level while middle class whites are squeezed out of jobs because there isn&rsquo;t enough (no matter how incompetent, criminal or corrupt) &#8220;diversity&#8221; a.k.a blacks and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; in Occupation X.</p>
<p><i>National Policy Institute is one of three local organizations that the Southern Poverty Law Center labels as a hate group promoting racial supremacy, said Heidi Beirich, a spokeswoman for the law center.</i></p>
<p>Where would America be without the SPLC&rsquo;s ransom note &#8220;racism&#8221;?</p>
<p><i>Bobby Price, <b>chairman of Augusta&rsquo;s New Black Panthers Party</b>, said the black nationalist organization formed in 1998 as a response to hate groups. He said the group, which opened an Augusta chapter in 2002, has not seen much growth because of the moderate views of most blacks.</i></p>
<p>And how many &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; organisations have arisen in response to the silent genocide of Western European peoples?</p>
<p><i>The League of the South promotes states&rsquo; rights and Anglo-Celtic culture in the South, said Ray McBerry, chairman of the Georgia chapter. Membership has grown over the past several months, but it has little to do with the president, he said.</i></p>
<p>Promoting &#8220;Anglo-Celtic&#8221; culture? What <i>RACIST!</i> drivel - it&rsquo;s not like they settled the South anyway.</p>
<p><i>The law center has not received any reports of violence from these organizations.</i></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s best to persecute them anyway, right?</p>

			<p>Rumor has it that for the first time in about 15 years the SPLC is losing donors at a substantial rate.  Their big shot donors whom they scare constantly describing every man, his dog and his computer, a hater are pulling back big time, because they have literally been beaten down to risky levels since this economic Tsunami hit, and it is projected that it will only get worse in the succeeding years.</p>
<p>About the umpteenth economist has come out with another book describing complete collapse into 2015, with each succeeding year after this one getting worse until we bottom out at about 2015.  There&rsquo;s a consensus on that time period, involving a lot of experts.</p>
<p>The famous economist Niall Ferguson told the Canadian press &#8220;There will be blood,&#8221; riots and governments will crumble to be replaced by extreme ones.</p>
<p>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090223.wferguson0223/BNStory/crashandrecovery/home/?pageRequested=2<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Heather Scoffield: Is a violent resolution to this crisis inevitable?&#8221;</p>
<p>Niall Ferguson: &#8220;There will be blood, in the sense that a crisis of this magnitude is bound to increase political as well as economic [conflict]. It is bound to destabilize some countries. It will cause civil wars to break out, that have been dormant. It will topple governments that were moderate and bring in governments that are extreme. These things are pretty predictable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will the SPLC survive all this?  How about the ACLU and other leftist radicals? Will their donors be broke or near insolvency?<br>

			<p> Once again, words like &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;hate groups&#8221; are used without a quote mark anywhere in sight, as if everyone is agreed that both things not only exist, but are serious problems in this country (and always committed or formed by White people, naturally).</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve written here on the putrid SPLC so many times that I&rsquo;m sure regular posters are sick of hearing it. But once again: Who do they think they are, and who do they think appointed them the designator almighty of what constitutes a &#8220;hate group&#8221;? What a smug, arrogant bunch of losers the SPLC&rsquo;ers must be!</p>

			<p>Any group that promotes White preservation is classified as a hate group by the SPLC.  The Boy Scouts are probably on their &#8220;hate list&#8221; because they don&rsquo;t allow sexual perverts in their ranks.  My God, what&rsquo;s happened to this country?  I can remember 1980 during my teen years and it was a whole different country.  Patriotism is dead, our gene pool is polluted, we&rsquo;re on the verge of collapsing as a nation and our occupied government is treating us as the enemy.  </p>

			<p>I wonder if a Stephanie Toone type ever bothers to actually consider whether what &#8220;hate groups&#8221; say is true   &mdash;   not whether it&rsquo;s &#8220;hateful,&#8221; not whether it&rsquo;s &#8220;supremacist,&#8221; simply whether it&rsquo;s true.  If she doesn&rsquo;t like the facts, and would prefer to look at them and then recoil in horror, that&rsquo;s one thing; but she should at least acquaint herself with the facts first, and decide whether or not predictions &#8220;evil right-wing racists&#8221; have made about the course of society, civility and economics have been vindicated, and if so what implications that might have for the future.<br>

			<p>So any group that speaks for the interest of one&rsquo;s own race is &#8220;hate&#8221;?  I prefer a majority white countrt, Europe to be run and populated with whites, my heirs to be white, but that&rsquo;s not out of hatred for other races.  It&rsquo;s just my prefernece.  I love people in other races, but I prefer my own.  </p>

			<p>Jupiter makes a very important point. People like Sean Hannity do a good job denouncing illegal immigration but in the next breath make sure they tell you how strongly they support legal immigation. Surely these establishment types realize that we don&rsquo;t have enough jobs for these &#8220;legals&#8221; and that roughly 95% of legals are nonwhites who hail from alien cultures in third world nations. Moratorium on ALL immigration now. Start demanding this from the feckless politicians before we don&rsquo;t have the political clout to do so.</p>

			<p>The SPLC has long been recognized as a dedicated leftist hate group. It exists essentially to provide bogus credence for attack stories of the week by our national liberal media to hide behind while maligning various conservative groups.</p>
<p>Just another cog in the vast oily machine of liberal deceit.</p>

			<p>I  don&rsquo;t want to live around different races even if they share my values. It&rsquo;s not that I hate other races. I want future generations of my family to have caucasian colors and features. White is beautiful to me! I also want to pass on treasured American/European traditions but once you mix races you lose all of that.  I&rsquo;m a cashier and I see all kinds of kids. When I see a white child i get a warm feeling in my heart. I don&rsquo;t have that same feeling for minority kids. That&rsquo;s how i know i don&rsquo;t like diversity. My heart tells me so.</p>

			<p>Some whites are still trying to defend themselves against various anti-white hate groups as though these anti-white hate groups are part of respectable society of aware white people. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as though some aware whites are afraid that people who really matter are saying  bad things about them.  Would you be as defensive if some loon standing on a street corner called you names?  Of course not. So, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Just point out that these anti-white hate groups are pushing a genocidal agenda and are trying to destroy whites.</p>
<p>The people in these anti-white hate groups, are not our people.  Their attacks on us should be considered as hate speech.</p>

			<p>These sites are not &#8216;hate groups&rsquo; they are &#8216;Anti-Multiculturalism Groups&rsquo;.  This is not hate, it&rsquo;s a political position.  The liberal media wants to affix the label &#8216;hate groups&rsquo; with the hopes that legislation can soon be enacted which would criminalize participation including reading of and posting to these web sites.  </p>
<p>Where hate does indeed enter into the picture has to do with the fact that I do hate the way my government and the media try to brainwash the unsuspecting populace that multiculturalism is a stregth when in fact it is now this countries&rsquo; prevailing weakness. Yes, it is indeed our prevailing weakness.</p>

			<p>There first tip-off that this Augusta Chronicle article was loaded was the phrase: &#8220;promotes white supremacy&#8221;. Yep. Nothing like setting the tone with THAT statement.</p>
<p>Stephanie Toone might have a different point of view concerning the National Policy Institute and the SPLC if she wasn&rsquo;t a liberal &#8216;person of color&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Sorry Stephanie, but you are woefully lacking in any sort of insight or objectivity. One would think, as a journalist, those might be shortcomings you&rsquo;d want to overcome.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be happier for them.  I am very glad they are around.</p>
<p>It is difficult not to admire and respect what they do.</p>
<p>However, as a committed Independent I would say that it would be nice if they were not identified as a Conservative group.</p>
