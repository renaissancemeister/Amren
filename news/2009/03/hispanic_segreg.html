<h1>Hispanic Segregation Up in Suburban Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report by the Pew Hispanic Center challenges the conventional assumption that growing minority populations will create an instant &#8220;melting pot&#8221; in suburban and other districts. It raises questions about whether local school boards need to actively promote integration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suburbia has changed  &mdash;  suburban schools are getting much more diverse,&#8221; said Richard Fry, a senior researcher at Pew, a Washington think tank. &#8220;But we shouldn&rsquo;t assume that white suburban students as a result are interacting significantly more with nonwhites.&#8221;</p>
<p>The popularity of charter schools, now promoted by President Barack Obama, is a factor behind some of the segregation in grades K-12, Fry and other experts say. This is because many charter schools have special ethnic themes or offer bilingual courses, and minorities are choosing to enroll in schools with classmates of the same race.</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s suburbs added 3.4 million students from 1993 to 2007, representing two-thirds of the growth in public school enrollment. Virtually all the suburban growth  &mdash;  99 percent  &mdash;  came from the addition of Hispanic, black and Asian students.</p>
<p>But while black and Asian students saw small gains in integration, Hispanic students were increasingly clustered at the same suburban schools. The study found their segregation was particularly evident not only in counties around Chicago, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and in Prince George&rsquo;s, Md., where their population is small compared with blacks and whites, but also in Hispanic hotspots in the Los Angeles, Miami and San Diego metro areas.</p>
<p>Among other findings:</p>
<p># White students comprised 59 percent of suburban public school enrollment, down from 72 percent in 1993. Hispanics, who now make up 20 percent of enrollment compared with 11 percent in 1993, were the primary driver of overall growth.</p>
<p># Minority students tended to cluster in schools where blacks, Hispanics and Asians made up the majority of students, rather than being evenly spread among schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest trends reflect some of the challenges ahead as public school districts educate a K-12 population that is increasingly minority.</p>
<p>David R. Garcia, an assistant professor of education at Arizona State University who has researched charter schools, said the dilemma of resegregation in some communities is complicated. That&rsquo;s because many minorities are choosing to congregate in charter schools because of their emphasis on special needs such as Hispanic students with English-language problems.</p>

			<p>Idiot Social Engineers just can&rsquo;t grasp what anyone living around New World Mestizos have always known, they have never intended to assimilate - but simply occupy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hispanic Segregation Up in Suburban Schools. Hispanic students congregate with one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically true with all the people of the world.  It&rsquo;s called tribalism. </p>
<p>Only the leftist dregs seem to think they&rsquo;ve pointed out something nobody was aware of.  LOL!</p>
<p>White liberals are the curse of the Western world. </p>

			<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t want Mestizos to &#8220;assimilate&#8221;  &mdash;  I want them to leave!  The same goes for East Asians, Africans, Arabs, and other non-whites.  &#8220;Assimilation&#8221; taken to its logical conclusion, means race-mixing.  There is no way around it.  The liberal fringe will applaud the breeding-out of the white race as a sign of &#8220;progress&#8221;, which in essence means dumbing down our culture and institutions to accomodate less intelligent citizens.</p>
<p>Of course, even interbreeding won&rsquo;t eliminate any of the problems caused by diversity, since smarter, and probably lighter skinned mulattos will still be resented by their darker counterparts all the same.  This won&rsquo;t stop the liberals from trying.</p>

			<p>I know a great place for hispanics to get together.  It&rsquo;s called Mexico.  Let&rsquo;s use some of Obama&rsquo;s stimulus money to give as many of them a free trip as possible.</p>

			<p>The usual story.</p>
<p>Hispanics move out to the suburbs to get away from each other and to be around whites.</p>
<p>But they self-segregate once they do.</p>

			<p>Our suburban areas have become instant barrios in the last 24 months. Gangs of Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, an assorted illeagals are renting distresed homes faster than Ricky Martin cds. The result of all this cutural diversity is that within the last 2 years both schools in our newly developed suburbs have had their test scores drop from Bees to Dees on the FCAT. <br>
