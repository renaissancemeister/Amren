			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Chapman, Daily Mail (London), March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ethnic minorities could receive extra help during the recession following Government fears they will be hardest hit as the economy deteriorates.</p>
<p>Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell announced a controversial drive to ensure ethnic minority workers are not  &#8216;left behind&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He warned that employment levels amongst ethnic minorities fell by ten percentage points in the 1990s recession, more than other groups.</p>
<p>Mr Purnell, announcing the initiative in a speech to Labour&rsquo;s Black Asian and Minority Ethnic annual general meeting in Leicester, said it was vital to ensure the mistakes of previous recessions were not repeated.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the past too many were left behind in bad times. Ethnic minority workers suffered most in the Tory recessions,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Employment levels amongst ethnic minority workers fell by 10 percentage points in the 1990s recession  &mdash;  much worse than rest of the country.</p>
<p>&#8216;Just think of the waste of human potential. Whole communities were abandoned, families where no one then worked for generations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the Government&rsquo;s focus on minorities drew criticism from Conservative MPs, who warned it risked entrenching division.</p>
<p>Shipley MP Philip Davies said: &#8216;This is simply outrageous. The Government should be targeting support at all who need it.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Government should be colour blind when it comes to looking who needs help. Doing otherwise will only entrench racism, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Government should be looking now to help the groups that have already been hit, like savers.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is the sort of thing that gives politics a bad name  &mdash;  ministers talking to different groups and telling them what they want to hear. It drives me to distraction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the TaxPayers&rsquo; Alliance campaign group said: &#8216;At a time when so many people are feeling the pinch, the Government should be allocating help on the basis of need.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lots of people are suffering hard times in the recession. The last thing they need is for the Government to play politics with different ethnic minority and gender groups.</p>
<p>&#8216;Instead, it should concentrate on an honest effort to help us all through the recession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will assess the impact of unemployment on ethnic minorities, women, the disabled and older workers and advise ministers on steps to take.</p>
<p>Business groups have warned that women may bear the brunt of the economic downturn, since they are more likely to be employed part-time or on temporary contracts and may be first in line when jobs are cut.</p>
<p>Mr Purnell said in previous downturns, unemployment amongst older workers had also been deeper and more prolonged and said the talents of a generation of disabled people had been &#8220;squandered&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Over half a million people were pushed onto incapacity benefit and forgotten about,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;But, as much as the Tories might have wanted them too they didn&rsquo;t just disappear. We still bear the scars of those decisions in so many communities and households today.</p>
<p>&#8216;In this recession evidence so far is that its effects, however painful, are being spread across the population more evenly. But we will not take any chances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Purnell said EHRC chairman Trevor Phillips had agreed to work with the Government to assess whether any groups were suffering disproportionately in the recession.</p>
<p>&#8216;When we identify particular problems, we will know we need to adapt our policies to make sure that no one is left behind this time,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: &#8216;This recession has had a terrible impact for hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their job or are under threat  &mdash;  men and women, the old and young, white, black or Asian, students struggling to find a job, disabled people.</p>
<p>&#8216;We want to understand the patterns that are already starting to emerge.</p>
<p>&#8216;Are women more at risk than men? Are older workers more at risk than younger? Are disabled people more at risk than others? Are people in poorer parts of Britain more at risk than the wealthy? And, if they are, why and what can we do about it?</p>
<p>&#8216;By developing a clear understanding of what is happening on the ground we can make a difference this time round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But shadow work and pensions secretary Theresa May said: &#8216;This is typical of Labour&rsquo;s dithering response to the recession.</p>
<p>&#8216;All James Purnell is promising is quarterly reviews and more reports. The recession is hitting all groups and all parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#8216;The heart of the problem is still about getting credit flowing through to businesses to help them stay afloat and keep people in jobs.</p>
<p>&#8216;That&rsquo;s why they should adopt our Â£50 billion loan guarantee scheme and relax the rules to allow people on jobseekers allowance to take training courses immediately.&#8221;<br>

			<p>And what will you think if you are a white Briton who loses his or her job, which you got last because of affirmative (positive) action, and you were promoted lastly if at all because of the same?  You&rsquo;ll see the minorities getting extra government help (like they usually do in one form or another), and what will their reaction be?  Hopefully, joining the BNP.</p>

<p><br>
What it&rsquo;s MOST typical of, is Labour&rsquo;s preferential treatment of nonwhite immigrants; and their corresponding disdain for native-born white British. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why more and more native-born white British join the BNP with each passing week. </p>

			<p>&#8220;MP: Special help for non-whites &ldquo;will only entrench racism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Wait until he sees what fighting with third world hordes for jobs is going to do to white attitudes in a few months.</p>
<p>And I wonder what the multicults think is going to happen if their home-grown terrorists blow up something else and kill innocent whites who might be waiting in line to get benefits or food for their families.</p>
<p>Anybody in favor of &#8220;diversity&#8221; is a deranged fool.</p>

			<p>Headlines like this one, start me off on my own little emotional cycle that can take anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of weeks to run it&rsquo;s course.<br>
First I get angry, then I feel powerless and sad, then apathic and then usually I find something else that gets me angry again (if it&rsquo;s not a external story like this one, I&rsquo;ll be self-disguist at my own useless self-pity).</p>
<p>The inbetween times seem to becoming less and less.<br>
Maybe ignorance is bliss. <br>
But then even my escapisms are fleeting, as you have to come back to the real world eventually.<br>
It&rsquo;s too hard to choose ignorance once you&rsquo;ve known something.<br>
And it&rsquo;s hard to go back to that place of innocence, after you&rsquo;ve lost it.<br>
 <br>
I often wish I was in my prime in the 1950&rsquo;s. (Sounds like my sad voice, which is usually followed by me <i>mentally</i> kicking myself in my ass).<br>
I probably sound like a candidate for the rubber room.</p>

			<p>Just to add to my prior post, and this won&rsquo;t make much sense if it didn&rsquo;t get through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Taoist phrase that says <br>
&#8220;to be strong, is to be consistent&#8221;.</p>
<p>I just want to say with all of my ups and downs (inconsistency).<br>
I really admire all the regular posters here like Question Diversity and John PM (to name a few, because there are so many).<br>
Who show their mental strength with their consistency. <br>
You and your ilk are really inspirational.<br>
Along with sites like Amren and VDare of course.</p>

			<p>When jobs become scarce, they must be rationalized for the most deserving.  </p>
<p>A Middle Easterner or African or Asian can always return to his clan homeland, usually in a warmer climate where he won&rsquo;t need the same resources required for heat and energy as in England.</p>
<p>The government should be organizing a humanitarian sea and airlift to remove these people, before they spend next winter cold and starving.</p>

<p>Yes - better to throw away a native white than a transplanted other as they so obviously have more potential.  It turns my stomach.</p>

<p>Gimme a break. Many of them have been avoiding work and living on the dole for so long that they didn&rsquo;t even notice there was a recession!</p>

			<p>   It must be obvious to all but the brain dead that Indigenous British people have become second class citizens in their own country. The only solution is to vote for the one party that will look after the interests of the native peoples of formerly Great Britain  &mdash;  The British National Party!</p>

			<p>The heading for this story should read &#8216;Government to get extra help from minority groups to protect them during the next election&rsquo;. I really don&rsquo;t see anyone supporting labour except africans and pakistanis, the only groups to have benefitted from years of anti-English scottish mis-rule. Meanwhile, our prime minister is visiting the US of A having brief chats with the new president, no doubt trying to explain why UK passport holders are now subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny as many born in UK are terror suspects. It didn&rsquo;t used to be like this as our British passport was presented with pride anywhere in the world and the bearer trusted and respected. Of course, homeland security can simply take one look at the holder and decide whether or not there could be a problem. However, this is called &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo; (or something simliar) so is not permitted. Something you catch from the sea having six legs, claws and a hard shell could hardly be mistaken for a cod, but which one you keep and which one you throw back depends entirely on what you were fishing for. </p>

			<p>The same will happen, heck, it IS happening in the US. It should be obvious that those who are in charge of turning the US and Western European countries into third world dumps are making sure their new chosen populations are taken care of, so they can continue breeding. </p>
