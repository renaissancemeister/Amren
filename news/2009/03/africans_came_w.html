<h1><a href="http://www.livescience.com/history/090320-columbus-teeth.html">Africans Came with Columbus to New World</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>LiveScience, March 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Teeth from exhumed skeletons of crew members Christopher Columbus left on the island of Hispaniola more than 500 years ago reveal the presence of at least one African in the New World as a contemporary of the explorer, it was announced.</p>
<p>A team of researchers is extracting the chemical details of life history from the remains found at shallow graves at the site of La Isabela, the first European town in America, said T. Douglas Price, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of anthropology and leader of the team conducting an analysis of the tooth enamel of three individuals from a larger group excavated almost 20 years ago there.</p>
<p>Three of the individuals&rsquo; teeth subjected to isotopic analysis by the Wisconsin group were males under the age of 40 and had carbon isotope profiles far different from the rest, suggesting an Old World origin (Africa or Europe).</p>
<p>&#8220;I would bet money this person was an African,&#8221; Price says of one of the three individuals whose teeth were subjected to analysis.</p>
<p>It was known that Columbus had a personal African slave on his voyages of discovery. It is unknown whether the individual studied by Price and his colleagues was a slave or a crew member. The new analysis could mean that Africans played a much larger role in the first documented explorations of America.</p>
<p>If confirmed, that would put Africans in the New World as contemporaries of Columbus and decades before they were thought to have first arrived as slaves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Isotopic analysis</p>
<p>The unpublished study relied on isotopic analysis of three elements: carbon, oxygen and strontium.</p>
<p>Carbon isotope ratios provide reliable evidence of diet at the time an individual&rsquo;s adult teeth emerge in childhood. For example, people who eat maize, as opposed to those who consume wheat or rice, have different carbon isotope ratio profiles locked in their tooth enamel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Oxygen isotopes provide information about water consumption and also can say something about geography as the isotopic composition of water changes in relation to latitude and proximity to the ocean.</p>
<p>Strontium is a chemical found in bedrock and that enters the body through the food chain as nutrients pass from bedrock to soil and water and, ultimately, to plants and animals. The strontium isotopes found in tooth enamel, the most stable and durable material in the human body, thus constitute an indelible signature of where someone lived as a child.</p>
<p>The strontium isotope analysis, Price notes, is not yet complete, as samples from the teeth of the presumed sailors remain to be matched with strontium profiles of Spanish soils. However, such matches could open an intriguing window to the personal identities of individuals buried in La Isabela.</p>

			<p>Oh, please!  The assertion that someone buried in La Isabela nearly five centuries ago might have been a black African indicates that Africans might have played &#8220;a much greater&#8221; role in the exploration of the Americas than was previously believed?</p>
<p>Spare us all the invention of any more presumptive black history, which has already reached epidemic proportions in this country.</p>

			<p>Columbus came to the new world with a black cabin boy named Laboofa and a Korean storekeeper to manage the ship&rsquo;s provisions.  Laboofa was jealous of the Korean, so he murdered him, thinking Columbus would then put him in charge of the store.  Columbus felt sorry for the boy, so instead of hanging him he marooned him with the Arawaks.  Laboofa spent all of his time with the Arawak smoking their potent brand of tobacco, refused to work, raped two Arawak women, and was finally killed after defacating near the cassava stores one too many times. </p>

			<p>Columbus&rsquo;s blacks were calle Moors.  The Moors help the white Spanish conquer and enslave the Indians of the New World.  It was probabally the idea of these Moors to capture and sell the indians.</p>

Of course we all know of the great nautical skills and exploratory curiosities of black Africans. I&rsquo;m starting a pool right now on when we will all be told that not only was the black on the ship instrumental to Columbus&rsquo; success but that the whole expedition was actually designed and planned by the &#8220;African&#8221; and that Columbus &#8220;stole&#8221; the credit for the discovery of the New World.  I say it&rsquo;ll be taught in the government schools within five years.</p>

			<p>Good grief!  Here we go again!   Will this issue never be put to rest?  A person of &#8220;African&#8221; origin does not necesssarily mean Black! Africa is a huge continent and not eveyone there is &#8220;black&#8221;.  [Why are we not allowed to use the correct racial term?]</p>
<p>How times mmust that point be made? </p>
<p>NORTH Africa is a neighbor of Spain, within just a few miles.  There had always been traffic back and forth between the two. It&rsquo;s not surprising that they had extensive contacts. But North Africans (Berbers and Arabs) ARE NOT BLACK!  </p>
<p>Admittedly, it is within possibility that there might have been a rare sub-Saharan African (i.e. Black) among his crew, but that would have been (at that time, 1492) most unusual. The trans-Saharan trade routes had not yet been developed;  and Blacks were not sailors anyway. A ship was probably the last place you would find one.  And I doubt that they were wheat and rice eaters either.</p>
<p>How much of this Afro-centrist pandering are we going to be subjected to?  Next thing, they&rsquo;ll be informing us that Columbus and Isabella were really Black.<br>

			<p>     Sure Blacks started Irish Culture as well. You&rsquo;ve heard of<br>
the Black Irish right? So next St Patrick&rsquo;s day don&rsquo;t be amazed<br>
to see a Black all in green-he&rsquo;s just taking back his culture.<br>
Any discomfort you feel is just your racism. And may you live<br>
long.<br>
    Anyway, it&rsquo;s good that physical anthropology isn&rsquo;t completely<br>
in abeyance. With these techniques they should be able to analyze<br>
the Black&rsquo;s skull and notice the very small braincase. He was<br>
probably the dishwasher or something. Dishwashers played a key<br>
role in the exploration of America.</p>

<p>Well, considering that the majority of books in the &#8220;Ethnic Studies&#8221; section of my library repeatedly denounce &#8220;race&#8221; as a &#8220;white social construct&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, what I&rsquo;m curious about is what these scientists mean by &#8220;African&#8221; - does he mean North African, like the Berbers? East African, like the Ethiopians? West African, like the Mandinkas?</p>
<p>As any anthropologist with a brain will tell you, &#8220;Africa&#8221; is a continent, not a race.</p>

			<p>First off, no where in this article does it say that the supposed African remains are Black. It implies that by bringing up the slave fact, but saying a person is African does not automatically mean Black. If they are studying teeth, the race could be easily determined because teeth are an excellent indicator of race as Blacks, Whites and Asians have distinctive dental characeristics that are used by anthropologists to determine race. Blacks have the largest teeth with the thickest enamel and if the teeth are at all well preserved, any anthropologist could tell the race without isotopic analysis, which suggests that the remains are not Black. I think that the article intentionally misleads and many here on this site are caring when they shouldn&rsquo;t. This is non-news.</p>

			<p>The issue is fudged by the term &#8220;African&#8221;. It is too vague and disingenuous. Since Spain is only twelve miles away from Africa, I could buy that possibility, but a NORTH AFRICAN, not a SUB-SAHARAN one. This could mean anything from an Arab, to a Berber, to any number of other peoples. The Phoenicians and the Greeks had settlements all over North Africa in Antiquity. The Germanic Vandals settled their too.</p>

<p>Pretty soon we will understand that not one white man fought in WWII or even the Civil War, it was all black all the time.</p>
<p>Interesting how anyone questioning any aspect of Jewish history is labeled a hater and bigot, whereas revisionists constantly attack and rewrite white history are held as truth tellers.</p>

			<p>So now, the story will be that Columbus could never have made it the New World without the assistance of some african.  That&rsquo;s hysterical.  Just like Admiral Perry would never have made it to the pole unless his african servant hadn&rsquo;t picked him up and carried him on his back.  And let us not forget that America was built completely off the backs of africans.  They built the cities, the tunnels, the bridges, the buildings. </p>
<p>Then how come they are still living in straw huts in africa.</p>

			<p>This is along the same lines as the recent &#8220;study&#8221; which once again hauls out the worn-out claim that Cleoptra &#8220;may&#8221; have been &#8220;black.&#8221; despite the huge, verifiable evidence that she was certainly NOT! Her lineage is WELL DOCUMENTED as she was of Greek and Mecedonian heritage.  These attempts will continue as long as there are social Marxists on the planet.  They can &#8220;claim&#8221; all they want, but they ALWAYS fall flat when they&rsquo;re asked for PROOF.  </p>

<p>&#8221;The new analysis could mean that Africans played a <br>
much larger role in the first documented explorations of America&#8221;</p>
<p>What is unsaid that this skeleton was most very likely that of Columbus&rsquo; African slave.</p>
<p>&#8221;Three of the individuals&rsquo; teeth subjected to isotopic analysis <br>
by the Wisconsin group were males under the age of 40 and had <br>
carbon isotope profiles far different from the rest, suggesting <br>
an Old World origin (Africa or Europe)&#8221;.</p>
<p>So he would almost definitely be European as we knew that Columbus&rsquo; crew weren&rsquo;t Africans unless all previous historical sources have been hiding the fact that Africans were crew members, but this brainwashed stooge comes up with the opposite politically-correct conclusion &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would bet money this person was an African,&rdquo; Price says of one of the three individuals whose teeth were subjected to analysis&#8221;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is more revisionism at work.  An honest mistake? No, more likely the work of a politically-correct zealot. Here in the UK these are the politically-correct creeps that are being given the plum jobs, the TV programs about archaeology and history. Just last night on BBC there was a documentary on &#8216;Cleopatra&rsquo;s sister&rsquo; with a lot of hypothetical stuff that archaeologists are famous for, finally naming a headless skeleton found at Ephesus in Turkey as &#8216;probably that of Cleopatra&rsquo;s sister. With only a few minutes to go I thought that my worst fears had not been realised and Cleopatra was not going to be outed as black. Did I get a shock when the presenter/archaeologist, a politically-correct charlatan named Neil Oliver, introduced the facial reconstruction expert who had created a cast of the face of the headless skeleton found with the words &#8221;we&rsquo;ve always thought of tht Ptolomey&rsquo;s (Cleopatra&rsquo;s line) as Greeks &hellip; but this skull (made with no facial fragments at all) has features found on some European and some African skulls &hellip; (and turning to the female skull reconstructionist he said) and Cleopatra&rsquo;s line had African ancestry, isn&rsquo;t that correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>To be fair to the skull reconstructionist she didn&rsquo;t deny it but didn&rsquo;t fully confirm it either by repeating not what this charlatan had said but what the evidence showed. &#8221; &hellip; yes, both European and African skulls have this feature&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can only assume that the same forces that are doing their best to destroy Western Civilisation are responsible for this deliberate historical misinformation. More dumbing-down from our NWO elite.</p>

<p>North Africans were called blacks or Moors by Spaniards who are indeed clearly white people. North Africans are made up by Ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, Germanic Vandals, Berbers (they are not Arabs, original Nomadic North Africans) and Oriental Arabs. None of them are black.</p>

Nonsense.  I am unaware that they were ever generically called black in Spanish. (Except perhaps the very few that really were.)  Moors, yes &hellip; because they came from Mooritania, or Moorocco (Mauritania/Morocco). But Moors were not considered black; they were just Moslems from across the Straits. Spain later referred to Turks as Moors also, lumping them all together, and you know that Turks are not black.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the ruling caste of Arabs (in Spain) came from Syria, via Crete, not even from North Africa. They only used the recently converted Berbers as their footsoldiers.<br>

<p>Right! Arabs (true Arabs) are caucasian. The caucasian Arab muslims such as Kuwaiti and Saudi are the real threat to civilization as we know it. The blacks can be bnought off but the fundamentalist muslims cannot, they will only settle for total victory and subjugation of the christian world.</p>

Correct.  Even those so-called &#8220;Arabs&#8221; from Syria were only recently (within the century) conquered and converted  (by real Arabs from out of Arabia).   Before that, they had been Greeks, Phoenicians, Anatolians, and whatever (Hellenistic,)  &mdash;   not Arabs at all.  So there&rsquo;s even LESS excuse to call them &#8220;black&#8221;, which they never were. </p>

One must bear in mind that the Arabs/Moors were present  in Spain for 800 years   &mdash;   a very long span of time.   That is four times the lifespan of the USA!   It gets complcated. </p>
<p>During that time, there were actually several invasions which came in separate waves.  The last one, the Almohads, were an ascetic group of Islamic fanatics who came from out of the deep south of Morocco.  Although the Almohads were  Berbers,  there were probably some blacks among them.   Much like today&rsquo;s alQueda, they were determined to &#8220;correct&#8221;  the easy-going, tolerant, pleasure-loving Arabs then ruling in Spain (who had become very Hispanicized).  Their intolerance and religious zeal made them hated everywhere, even in Morocco, and their regime did not last long  (1163-1227,  64 yrs.)   In fact, it probably contributed to the ultimate and complete expulsion of the Moors from Spain.</p>
<p> <i> &#8220;The Almohads&rsquo;  [intolerance and severity]&hellip;led to rebellion against them throughout southern Morocco and along the coast.  This rebellion was crushed and thousands of people were executed. When Marrakesh was captured, according to one source, the Christian church there was destroyed and a great number of Jews and Christians were killed.  When �?Abd al-Mu&rsquo;min conquered Tunisia   [Afriqiya]  in 1151, he gave the Jews and Christians there the option of conversion or death.</i> <br>
