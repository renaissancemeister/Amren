<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-asia/20090318/AS.Philippines.US.Marine/">Filipino Who Accused Marine of Rape Changes Story</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hrvoje Hranjski, AP, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Filipino woman whose accusations of rape led to the high-profile conviction of a U.S. Marine has altered her testimony, saying in an affidavit that she may have led him to believe she wanted sex.</p>
<p>The woman moved to the U.S. this week and is no longer willing to talk about the case, her lawyer said Wednesday. Lance Cpl. Daniel Smith, convicted in 2006 of raping the woman and sentenced to 40 years in prison, remains detained at the U.S. Embassy while he pursues an appeal.</p>
<p>The case strained U.S.-Philippine military relations and became a rallying point for anti-American protesters who have called for the scrapping of a pact that allows U.S. troops to train Filipino soldiers.</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s accuser submitted a five-page affidavit to an appeals court Tuesday saying she now doubts her own version of events.</p>
<p>&#8220;My conscience continues to bother me realizing that I may have in fact been so friendly and intimate with Daniel Smith .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that he was led to believe that I was amenable to having sex or that we simply just got carried away,&#8221; the woman said in the statement.</p>
<p>She described the two were drinking, kissing and dancing at a bar at the former U.S. Naval base at Subic Bay before moving to a van, where she originally told the court she was raped while she passed out. Smith had insisted the sex was consensual.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice Secretary Raul Gonzalez said the woman could be charged with perjury.</p>

			<p>The strange part is that he is white.  Usually, if a native woman gets raped by a member of the American military, he&rsquo;s black.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The woman moved to the U.S. this week&#8221;</p>
<p>How is this possible?  What circumstances did this happen under? </p>
<p>What can she possibly offer in return for the right to live in the United States?</p>

			<p>I am continually amazed at the ignorance of today&rsquo;s women concerning the primal drive in males.</p>
<p>Not only do young women ignore it in their male acquaintances, thinking they can get drunk, dance, kiss, and carry on, and then retire to a van (as to a sleepover with a girlfriend) but married women ignore it in their spouses, once they have their children, leaving the husband wide open to temptation, &#8220;desperately in need of some stranger&rsquo;s hand, in a desperate land.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She probably claimed she was raped when he refused to marry her and take her to the &#8220;big BX&#8221; (base exchange). </p>
<p>Apparently she found some other way (or some other person) to get her here.</p>

			<p>Yet another reason for white men to stay out of the military.  There is nothing there for you and every reason to suspect you will be used up and thrown away.</p>

			<p>Every now and then I wonder why American Renaissance posts a certain story.  This is one of those times.  This is less a story about anti-White racism than it is about female duplicity towards males.  </p>
<p>It is a sad truism that a significant percentage of rape allegations, regardless of the race of the person who makes them, turn out to be falsehoods.</p>
<p>http://www.cmrlink.org/social.asp?DocID=276</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2003/0805roberts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2003/0805roberts.html</a></p>
<p>False allegations of rape create two victims: 1) obviously the male who&rsquo;s been falsely accused of rape 2) the female who was really raped and now refuses to come forward for fear of being labelled a liar.</p>
<p>In defense of the Filipina in this case, I might add pangs of conscience finally led her to come forward and speak the truth.  She could have just as easily stuck to her lie and left that poor guy to rot.  You can truthfully call her many things, but she&rsquo;s still a notch above the likes of Crystal Gail Mangum and Tawana Brawley.</p>
<p>As for Daniel Smith?  He&rsquo;d do well in the future to avoid non-White women and heed the sagacious advice of Ann Coulter.</p>

			<p>A few years have passed but this sorry episode was once the #1 cause celebre in the Philippines; every politically-inclined woman who could stand up and hold a placard was in the streets of Manila yelling. </p>
<p>So now the lady has changed her version of events. Best of all, it is reported that she hopes to start a new life in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>What is the enduring slogan of Filipino nationalism?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yankee, Go Home! And take me with you!&#8221;</p>

			<p>While it is true that a significant number of rape cases are just cases of female regret, much more than that are not, and it must be stressed that anything beyond &#8220;no&#8221; is rape.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a drunk woman is pernicious and is dealt with severely by the law, whether the man is drunk or not.  Whether the drunk woman in this case said &#8220;no&#8221;  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t know. I would be inclined to doubt it since she went out to the van with him (unless he got her out there on some pretext, which is entirely possible). But to sex a woman &#8220;while she passed out&#8221; is extreme and disgusting advantage-taking. Indeed, some men get drunk so that they CAN let it all loose, and engage in this sort of behavior. </p>
<p>For a man to get drunk and engage in this behavior is white-trash. For this Filipino woman to get drunk and do the things she did with this drunken man is brown-trash, but at least she is having some pangs of regret about his fate, and her role in it.</p>
<p>I think it is entirely correct to put the burden of the question of rape on the man. The penalty for the female, in not exercising sound judgment is borne in her own conscience, either aggravating it or searing it.</p>
<p>She may have led him to believe that she wanted sex, or he may have wanted to believe that she did, or both. But I repeat, anything beyond &#8220;no&#8221; is rape.</p>
<p>As a man, I think that holding men up to a higher standard is not unfair, but is a compliment to the valor and self-control that they have, or should have. </p>
<p>Do not the White men of the West (this one being a Marine, at that) have self-control and valor?     </p>

			<p>Note the: &#8220;<b>We</b> simply just got carried away.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sounds like she wanted it but regretted it later for some reason and later decided to call it &#8220;rape&#8221; to appease herself.</p>
<p>Any military personnel flirting with non-white, non-US citizens anywhere is setting himself up for target practice by that ethnic group.  </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t get involved in relationships with men at all.  I am not sexually attracted to them and have accepted the fact that men don&rsquo;t want to be friends with women unless they think that it is going to get them some tail.  White men have to accept a few things to.  There is no such thing as &#8220;free love&#8221; guys.  The Third World women hanging around U.S. military bases are there to hustle you.  What they want from you has nothing to do with what you have got in your fly because they could just as easily get that from the local guys.</p>
<p>I am not just a cold-hearted woman about sexual assault. Am I sympathetic to rape victims?  Of course I am.  I work in critical care so I see the damage done to rape victims by their attackers or the damage the rape victims later do to themselves.  I know that rape survivors are nine times more likely to commit suicide.  Many are forever scared of men and hate them.  It is really sad because I think that some of them were pretty sweet and just trusted someone who shouldn&rsquo;t have been trusted and could have been good wives and mothers if that creep or group of creeps hadn&rsquo;t come along. </p>
<p>There is another issue that military men need to remember.  Because the local women may see you as their ticket to the U.S., the local men are jealous of you.  That makes you a target.  Think about it.  If you were a young man seeking a mate while you lived in a poor country near a military base, how would you like it if a bunch of foreign guys were helping themselves to what you thought should be your selection of women?  She sees what you have that the local guys don&rsquo;t.  Many of those guys would like to punish you just for that, and you will feel their wrath if one of the local women says that you abused her.  They will be ready to kick your butt, even if she is not anyone they care about.    </p>

			<p>I think she should be allowed to stay in the US, in a federal penitentiary, until her sentence for perjury is complete, and then deported.</p>
<p>Getting involved with this bimbo was a mistake on corporal Smith&rsquo;s part, but young men far from home often do stupid things.</p>

			<p>Reply to Ginny:</p>
<p>You have indirectly helped to make a point I have stated before. The USA should abandon its 1,000 (or so) military bases around the world and bring the troops home. This would help to avoid these type of situations IN THE FIRST PLACE! Why does the U.S. maintain bases in South Korea 56 years after the Korean war ended? Why do we keep troops in Okinawa? Why do we maintain (and expand) NATO, two decades after the USSR collapsed? Meanwhile we have a disintegrating border to our south. Crazy stuff. How would Americans like it if there were foreign troops based on THEIR SOIL?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Indeed, some men get drunk so that they CAN let it all loose, and engage in this sort of behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed, some women get drunk for the same reason.  Our culture has glorified one-night stands and no-strings-attached sex, but (unfortunately?) those situations tend to be quite awkward and difficult to achieve when both parties are sober.</p>
