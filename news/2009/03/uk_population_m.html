				<i>Jonathan Leake and Brendan Montague, Times of London, March 22, 2009</i>
			</p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
			<p>
				JONATHON PORRITT, one of Gordon Brown&rsquo;s leading green advisers, is to warn that Britain must drastically reduce its population if it is to build a sustainable society.
			</p>
			<p>
				Porritt&rsquo;s call will come at this week&rsquo;s annual conference of the Optimum Population Trust (OPT), of which he is patron.
			</p>
			<p>
				The trust will release research suggesting UK population must be cut to 30m if the country wants to feed itself sustainably.
			</p>
			<p>
				Porritt said: &#8220;Population growth, plus economic growth, is putting the world under terrible pressure.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Each person in Britain has far more impact on the environment than those in developing countries so cutting our population is one way to reduce that impact.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Population growth is one of the most politically sensitive environmental problems. The issues it raises, including religion, culture and immigration policy, have proved too toxic for most green groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Porritt is winning scientific backing. Professor Chris Rapley, director of the Science Museum, will use the OPT conference, to be held at the Royal Statistical Society, to warn that population growth could help derail attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rapley, who formerly ran the British Antarctic Survey, said humanity was emitting the equivalent of 50 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;We have to cut this by 80%, and population growth is going to make that much harder,&#8221; he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such views on population have split the green movement. George Monbiot, a prominent writer on green issues, has criticised population campaigners, arguing that &#8220;relentless&#8221; economic growth is a greater threat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many experts believe that, since Europeans and Americans have such a lopsided impact on the environment, the world would benefit more from reducing their populations than by making cuts in developing countries.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is part of the thinking behind the OPT&rsquo;s call for Britain to cut population to 30m &mdash; roughly what it was in late Victorian times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Britain&rsquo;s population is expected to grow from 61m now to 71m by 2031. Some politicians support a reduction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, said: &#8220;You can&rsquo;t have sustainability with an increase in population.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				The Tory leader, David Cameron, has also suggested Britain needs a &#8220;coherent strategy&#8221; on population growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these comments, however, government and Conservative spokesmen this weekend both distanced themselves from any population policy.&#8221;<br />

				That same lib who says let the third world into England all of sudden whines about overpopulation. What gives?
			</p>
			<p>
				Their angle is to decrease the white population. That&rsquo;s the whole reason for the &#8220;green&#8221; movement, if you scratch the surface. It is to decrease the population of the white middle class, and to reduce the expectations of the standard of living for remaining whites. All so corporations can have cheap labor, no unions. Ecology really doesn&rsquo;t play a role.

			</p>
			<p>
				Nonsense. Look at all the pollution in China and the deforrestation of third world countries like India and continents like Africa. Don&rsquo;t fall for this baloney. Whites are below replacement level fertility. A falling population would be a good thing if it weren&rsquo;t for all the mass immigration into the West from the third world. We control 35% of the world&rsquo;s landmass with 1.2 billion people. A falling population is the last thing we need right now. Breed! Breed! Breed!

				The British population must be cut in half? It&rsquo;s too crowded and polluted on the island. Something tells me they have a plan in place to achieve just that goal.

				Say - or post what you may, but the basic idea is right. In fact, unless the world reduces its population by at least that much, the world is unsustainable and will collapse from a number of well documented causes inclulding, final economic collapse, mass starvation, waves of pandemic diseases, rampant crime, war and &hellip;.. suicide - by those who just can&rsquo;t take anymore pain.
			</p>
			<p>
				But hey, why worry about that?

				This just shows once again why Britain and the West will collapse regardless. It is because they cannot see the writing on the wall for their own political correctness. They are so self-brainwashed that the elephant in the room, the burgeoning third world popuations are what must be controlled.
			</p>
			<p>
				It appears to me that this article is just a preparation for the final extermination of indigenous White Britons since there is no mention of deporting all the others to achive the lower-sustainable population. The idiots think that having more virtuous third worlders and Muslims will make Britain a more Green nation and not a major consumer of energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				But they cannot fathom themselves taking up the cause and going forth as their Victorian predecessors did, to try to bring enlightenment to the world. Of course, the West needs to bring new innovation to the world, not &#8220;restore&#8221; old, worn out and useless models. But some of us haven&rsquo;t the imagination for that advancement either. So the world is really in trouble, because neither the right or the left can escape their respective self-images to survive. RIP - Not!
			</p>
			<p>
				The ugly fact is that the most intelligent and innovative people not only ought to rule and deserve to live at a higher standard - it is necessary for everyone else to survive in ANY number.

				If they support a reduction in population then why don&rsquo;t they curtail immigration from the 3rd World into Britain? It&rsquo;s not the English that are breeding excessively, it&rsquo;s the 3rd World in their country that are doing it. This is just a refusal to face reality. That&rsquo;s why Britain hasn&rsquo;t long to go.

				Maybe if the UK got rid of all the 3rd world immigrants who are the ones procreating in the first place, the population will go down to maybe 20 million?

				I agree with Whiteplight. Just because the greens may have sinister motives does not mean that the basic point is wrong. Haven&rsquo;t we seen many commenters on this site bashing the Sierra Club for refusing to even bring up the population issue?
			</p>
			<p>
				A low-population white nation which permits no immigration would be a wonderful place to live. As populations decline, individual wealth would increase, yet housing costs would decline &mdash; not a bad situation, really.

				Europe is finally waking up to what a disaster immigration has been.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only have there been negative aspects, but there&rsquo;s a stunning lack of profound positive aspects, for any group involved.

				Canada&rsquo;s leading celebrity ecologist David Suzuki has a green foundation. He won&rsquo;t touch the immigration-environment issue either.

				It&rsquo;s is good to see the dam finally starting to break on this issue. The flood will follow.

				This is true - the UK is a pretty small island, and for the UK to be environmentally sustainable in the long run the population there will need to fall. The UK is very overpopulated - overcrowding has terrible effects humans, just look at some of the research.
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that ALL recent immigrants to the UK should be forced to leave, and a permanent moratorium on large-scale immigration should be enacted in to law.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, to bring the population of the UK to more sustainable levels for the long-term, millions of the (White) peoples native to the UK should be encouraged to immigrate to other White-majority countries (like the USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, etc) where there is still PLENTY of room for growth and expansion - these Whites should be encouraged to have VERY large families (which they cannot currently have in the UK because of many reasons, including overpopulation), thus growing the proportion of Whites worldwide and helping to further develop the economies of countries where we Whites are the majority.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other extremely overpopulated countries in Europe, like Germany, the Netherlands, and so on, should also ban all immigration and export some of their surplus population abroad to other White-majority countries where they can thrive better and have larger families, along with bringing the population levels of these overcrowded European nations down to more sustainable levels over the long-term. For instance, Germany is only about the size of the U.S. state of Montana&hellip;yet amazingly there are 80 million people crammed in to Germany! Why not bring a few million of those hard-working, law abiding, clean, and industrious Germans over to the USA and/or Cananda where they will have more room and resources to have large families and help expand the economy of the White Western world?
			</p>
			<p>
				As an American I&rsquo;d much prefer many millions of White immigrants from Germany, the Netherlands, the UK or elsewhere to come here rather than tens of millions of immigrants from the 3rd world who invariably bring their 3rd world attitudes and behaviors along with them.

				I used to worry about the future of our planet. Not anymore. THERE IS NO FUTURE. We whites are being sold out by our own &#8216;leaders&rsquo;, and are being boxed in for the kill. And I don&rsquo;t give a flyin&rsquo; ugly word what happens to the planet after we&rsquo;ve all been murdered.
			</p>
			<p>
				Environmentalism is pointless. Last year, I dumped my Prius for a big BMW SUV. If Jackson, Mississippi had a dealership, I&rsquo;d be getting a Maybach 57 next year. I&rsquo;ll settle for an S-class Mercedes, but would rather drive the gas-guzzling uber-monster. I stopped recycling in October. I&rsquo;d do other green-unfriendly things if I could think of any&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				But back to environmentalist fantasies: Has Jonathon Porritt acknowledged that the (real) British People WERE and ARE reproducing at below replacement rate ANYWAY? The population growth in Britain is entirely due to third-world Immigrants and their spawn. Our white world would be getting roomier and richer by the year, if not for our so-called &#8216;governments&rsquo; doing the opposite of what is their job.
			</p>
			<p>
				Slash and burn agriculture in the third world contributes enormously to the C02 in our atmosphere, as well as to particulate pollution. Africa&rsquo;s one giant dust bowl, these days, thanks to that continent&rsquo;s population boom, and African&rsquo;s nonexistent land management. Red dust from Africa occasionally gets dumped on Mississippi, now. Pesticides from China arrive, in measurable amounts, on the Pacific Coast. Yet twits like Porritt are blaming everything bad on US. And I would remind Mr. Porritt, that if it were not for the Europeans and Americans he wants to go away, there would BE no such thing as Environmentalism.
			</p>
			<p>
				It would be great if whites suddenly started breeding like crazy, and reclaimed our parts of the world. Personally, though, I&rsquo;m gonna live like there is no tomorrow. Because there IS NO tomorrow.

				All these nitwits who espouse population control act as if the populations we&rsquo;re talking about are interchangeable. As if reducing Europe&rsquo;s population by thirty million would be no different than reducing Africa&rsquo;s by that amount. If Europe were to reduce it&rsquo;s population under the present regime, millions more africans would miraculously appear to fill the void, but they would not miraculously have the civilizational ability that europeans have.

				Porritt is right, and the same applies to the US.
			</p>
			<p>
				We must:
			</p>
			<p>
				a) increase white birth rates, especially the cognitive elite,
			</p>
			<p>
				b) cease all immigration and start to return people to their home countruies, where they belong (deport them, bribe them, cut off their welfare, whatever&hellip;),
			</p>
			<p>
				c) reduce birth rates among hispanics,
			</p>
			<p>
				d) reduce co emissions per capita in the US by 50% immediately by stopping all the waste and sloppiness (which would bring us in line with the incredibly modern &amp; affluent &amp; high tech country where I live namely, Germany, living standards are HIGHER than in the US,
			</p>
			<p>
				e) retool our infrastructure so that we can live well without bribing Arab fascists or poisoning ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The US was a better place when it had 200 m insetad of 325, and if we hadn&rsquo;t bloated ourselves with immigration, I&rsquo;d still be living in a small town in Massachusetts.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we don&rsquo;t fix climate change YESTERDAY, then immigration won&rsquo;t really matter, because there will be no habitable planet left to fight over. <br />

				Because Britain is much smaller than America the ecological constriants on the problem at hand-race replacement-are more severe at the present time. My prediction is that Britain will implode before America. This will force the English,Welsh and Scots to throw out a majoirty of its muslim and hindu-sihk population. The British Goverment will no doubt attack its native population. This of course will backfire. The will be a revolt within the military.
			</p>
			<p>
				This will defintely be a signal to the rest of Europe and Ameica that the game is over. This why I am categoricall opposed to any European immigration at the present time. America shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a safety valve for Europe. Let Europe burn.

				I can offer the solution for cutting England&rsquo;s population down with a single word: DEPORTATION!
			</p>
			<p>
				With a very hefty PLUS to deportation being a staggering drop in the British crime reports. But I&rsquo;m sure the liberal fools of British politicians can&rsquo;t follow this reasoning or logic.

				Liberals are the same everywhere, Pro-environment, but pro-mass illegal immigration. AKA blind ideology. I&rsquo;m sure the conclusion will be to get rid of whites since we are the most successful and therefore use the most resources.

				No, the basic idea is NOT right. Third-world countries are breeding at a far greater rate than white-majority countries and their surplus populations are being welcomed into Western countries by dumb liberals who have the same deranged death-wish mindset as Jonathon Porritt. It&rsquo;s the third-world that has to keep its pants on. Man-made climate change is a scam conceived by the NWO elite to control Western populations. People who are worried about the future of the planet are too pre-occupied about this to notice that their nation-states are being dissolved under their very noses by the NWO.

				He&rsquo;s right that the population must decline, but he specifically states that he wants to get rid of whites, not third worlders. This man is an enemy of the white race, so don&rsquo;t be taken in by his sweet talk. He&rsquo;s right about reducing the population, but we must do this by expelling non-white colonists.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the way things are going, whites must secure a homeland, whether it be within their historical borders or someplace new. The Russians are already working to expel the non-whites from their midst, and there are still majority white countries in places such as Iceland and smaller countries in South America. We&rsquo;ll survive the long run, but I&rsquo;m worried about mixed countries such as the US and UK.

				Another genocidal maniac with yet another deranged reason for abolishing the white race by any means necessary. America is bad but the UK is off the scale of Nazilike hatred for whites because of the color of their skin. It&rsquo;s amazing. They hate white people because of the color of their skin. They want to eliminate white people from the face of the earth because they have white skin. But it never even enters their heads that they&rsquo;re racists!
