<h1>Enough of Multiculturalism  &mdash;  Bring On the Melting Pot</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lawrence Martin, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Issues don&rsquo;t get much hotter than immigration. It&rsquo;s where political correctness abounds, where allegations of intolerance and racism are but a breath away, where ministers had best show finesse with their pronouncements.</p>
<p>Not so Jason Kenney. Our man at the immigration turnstiles has been in a bull-in-a-china shop mode lately. He&rsquo;s told newcomers they have to speak our official languages better, he&rsquo;s barred British MP George Galloway from admittance, he&rsquo;s accused refugees of systematic abuse of the system, he&rsquo;s called for more integration of immigrants, and he&rsquo;s gone to war with the Canadian Arab Federation, a group that accuses him of being a shill for the Jewish community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s serious stuff. The purport is that immigrants must do more to conform to Canadian standards. The minister wants to tighten the definition of what it means to be Canadian. The pitch  &mdash;  when in Rome, do as the Romans do  &mdash;  is for less multiculturalism and more melting pot. &#8220;We want to avoid the kind of ethnic conclaves or parallel communities that exist in some European communities,&#8221; says Mr. Kenney. New Canadians have &#8220;a duty to integrate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We don&rsquo;t need the state to promote diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monte Solberg, the previous Conservative immigration minister, favours the move to the melting pot, saying the Liberal concept of the multicultural mosaic is dated. Immigrant communities are more self-assured now. Ottawa, Mr. Solberg says, shouldn&rsquo;t be in the business of preserving their cultures.</p>
<p>If the Conservatives press forward with this approach, it will be a big step for a government often criticized for having no vision. Multiculturalism has become one of our hallmarks. We have developed a reputation for tolerance. The Conservatives are saying that there&rsquo;s too much tolerance, that there needs to be limits. Mr. Kenney, for example, has ended the heritage language program wherein Ottawa helped pay for children to learn their parents&rsquo; language.</p>
<p>The government, favouring a more selective immigration process, brought in legislation last year that allowed it to fast-track the types of immigrants it wants and freeze out those it doesn&rsquo;t. Critics said it gave too much prerogative to the immigration minister. Many Liberals were pushing for increased immigration, saying an aging population and declining birth rate will reduce the population and, in turn, hinder economic growth.</p>
<p>In his book Unlikely Utopia, Michael Adams contests the need for melting-pot initiatives, saying it&rsquo;s the absence of a strong Canadian identity that helps make this country free of prejudice and a place where immigrants can feel comfortable. Communities with a stronger, more confined sense of themselves are less tolerant. In parts of Quebec and Europe, multiculturalism is seen as a threat. In Canada, Mr. Adams notes, it&rsquo;s a source of pride.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenney, one of the Harper government&rsquo;s most talented performers, earned goodwill among many ethnic communities when he served as secretary of state for multiculturalism. He was a workhorse, going to every ethnic event imaginable, earning the moniker Curry in a Hurry. The empathy he offered had a strategic purpose: The goal was to end the Liberals&rsquo; domination of the immigrant vote, and results in the last election showed he made some headway.</p>
<p>But his more aggressive approach, an attempt by the government to reinvent multiculturalism, may be putting the gains at risk. The barring of Mr. Galloway brought on widespread condemnation. The move to ramp up language requirements for entrants has led to allegations of intolerance. The heavy tilt to the Jewish community has alienated Muslims. In the House of Commons, however, the Liberals have been lax in going after Mr. Kenney, hardly mentioning, for example, the Galloway controversy.</p>
<p>In that he is viewed as a potential leadership contestant, Mr. Kenney&rsquo;s pugnacity on the immigrant file might be a bid to burnish his right-side credentials. But there is likely more to it than that. The Conservatives appear set on charting a new course on immigration.</p>
<p>While melting-pot measures may alienate pockets of the population, they speak to their core beliefs. They also speak well to many Canadians who feel that indulgence toward immigrants has been carried too far.<br>

			<p>Hey, here is a thought.  How about just stopping immigration and allow the Canadian population to naturally adapt.  Increased population is increased pressure on the enivironment.  Increased diversification in the population is increased pressure on the social fabric and a dubious economic gain at best.  It is time to  abandon the psychology of more and honestly, that is honestly, comes to terms with sustainability.</p>

			<p>Melting Pot is worse than Diversity; It destroys the identity of everyone and replaces it with the dominant pop culture.  Dominant pop culture today is decidedly low brow, coarse, vulgar and anything but an acheivement of civilization.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind multiculturalism if governments did not force one on or into another.  What sort of world will we have when there is nothing traditionally, culturally, AND racially definable?  What a lousy, debauched, seedy, ugly future we face.</p>

			<p>A melting pot will be a much bigger disaster than multiculturalism. Maintaining the White genome will become very hard and without maintaining that, European/ western civilization has no meanng. Multiculturalism is good as it will keep us apart.</p>

			<p>I believe that nations should be able to let in or not let in whoever they want, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that there are black nations that don&rsquo;t want whites, and that&rsquo;s fine  &mdash;  their sandbox, their rules.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really sad is that I&rsquo;m an American and I&rsquo;m not quite sure what American culture is supposed to be!</p>

			<p>How about a boiling pot? That is what immigration has created here in the USA since 1965. There can be NO assimilation of third world peoples, period. History and facts prove that. </p>

			<p>I agree with Arthur, it would be best to just stop immigration to Canada, especially third world immigration, for a good long while. The rural areas are fine, but the major cities, and increasingly the smaller cities, are filling up with third world invaders who don&rsquo;t speak English or French, don&rsquo;t dress properly, don&rsquo;t have any skills or abilities that are marketable, and don&rsquo;t appear to like white people or Canada. But if these people act this way, then Canada itself is to blame. The government has promoted multiculturalism, which is the cause of these ghettos, segregation, and general mistrust.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is the white persons&rsquo; proclamation that anything that you are not is better than what you are. It&rsquo;s about asking others to take you over and make you into what they are. It&rsquo;s about trumpeting that which doesn&rsquo;t work elsewhere over that which does work here.</p>
<p>Small wonder that nobody I know believes in multiculturalism. Kudos to Jason Kenney for finally doing something. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how far he does go. But given past experience re: throwing out multiculturalism once and for all, I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.<br>

			<p>Alexandra,</p>
<p>The United States of America is a white, Anglo nation, given it&rsquo;s character by the land it inhabits, the traditions of it&rsquo;s founding population, their biological descendants, and those fully assimilated, mostly interbred, white immigrants and their descendants. Some of the men who shaped and defined this country are:</p>
<p>George Washington<br>
Thomas Jefferson<br>
John Adams<br>
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow<br>
Edgar Allan Poe<br>
James Whitcomb Riley<br>
Walt Whitman<br>
Henry James<br>
Ernest Hemingway<br>
F. Scott Fitzgerald<br>
Abraham Lincoln<br>
Jefferson Davis<br>
Robert E. Lee<br>
James Calhoun<br>
Patrick Henry<br>
Robert Frost<br>
Kit Carson<br>
Daniel Boone <br>
Davy Crockett<br>
Theodore Roosevelt<br>
Andrew Jackson<br>
Stanford White<br>
Joseph Smith<br>
D.W. Griffith<br>
Augustus Saint-Gaudens<br>
Benjamin Franklin<br>
Lilian Gish (maybe you can come up with more women)<br>
many more&hellip;</p>
<p>I could strain to mention blacks and other minority groups, but it would be an affectation.  Is the long-standing Albanian minority in Italy an noteworthy part of Italian Culture because they affect the society?  Or the Muslims of China?  Blacks, Hispanics, etc.(Jews are a more complex issue), affect our culture through their presence at any given time, but if they were to leave we would eventually forget about them.  On the other hand, we can never forget most of whom I listed.  If we did we wouldn&rsquo;t be America anymore.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very sad.  It&rsquo;s evident that you are rather young. Anyone with a memory before the 60&rsquo;s would know what an an American is (or was). And what our culture was all about.</p>
<p>I was having a conversation with a friend the other day, about the opera &#8220;Madame Butterfly&#8221;, written about 1905, when Americans knew very clearly what an American was. And also what an American was NOT.  The opera concerned Lt. Pinkerton&rsquo;s unwillingness - indeed his inability - to take his foreign lover home to America. Instead, he left Butterfly behind and returned home to marry his old sweetheart, Kate.   Marrying someone of another race, in 1905, was simply not done. Unlike today&rsquo;s multi-racial navy, where miscegenation is encouraged, it would have ruined his career. Back home, he would have been a social pariah.  It was unthinkable. Realizing this harsh truth, poor Butterfly killed herself.</p>
<p>That was, as I said, when there was a very clear distinction as to who an American was or was not. My friend perceptively remarked that anyone born after 1965 would not be able to comprehend this opera. It was from another time, another culture.  It would be totally over their head.<br>

<p>You missed Mark Twain, an author who has to top the list of writers who contributed to Amerian culture.</p>

<p>America has long been defined by popular culture.  When popular culture passed out of the control or grew less and less influenced by Whites of European ancestry, it became less appropriate for Whites.  However, many Whites just follow popular culture with no foundation.  That is because American Whites loose their old country culture by the second, certainly third generation.  </p>
<p>If you want to see a good example of what I mean, get hold of, or tune in on TCM when a film called &#8220;I Remember Mamma&#8221; is shown again.  Whites fresh from Europe before WW1 gave us our various ethnic cultures here.  That I why I try to remember mine always and keep my home filled with the art and influences of my ancestors.  My opinion is that the only relgion worth practicing is a form of ancestor worship.  With that come pride in who you are and the strength to continue your line as it has been.  Genealogy is great for this purpose.  All other religions are a trick to take us from our real selves and our real people.</p>

			<p>The melting pot is a genocide crockpot.</p>
<p>Blending together genetically different peoples is genocide. </p>
<p>The old so-called American Melting Pot actually referred to having WHITE EUROPEANS come here and blend away their purely national differences.  </p>
<p>The new melting pot demands that people acquire the genes of people who not all related as were the Europeans. This is a melting that is not good, and will lead to devolution.  It is genocide and extinction of the white genotype  &mdash;  which of fairly recent origin and thus somewhat fragile and subject to being absorbed into other genotypes.</p>
