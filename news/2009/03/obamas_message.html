<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Message: Glory Days of Open Border Are Gone</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ibbitson, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Janet Napolitano has a message for Canadians: It&rsquo;s a border. Get used to it.</p>
<p>The new Homeland Security Secretary had only stern comments yesterday about the state and future of the Canada-U.S. border, at a symposium hosted by the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>Her goal seemed to be to throw a bucket of reality on anyone who hoped that the arrival of Barack Obama&rsquo;s new administration would herald a loosening of new restrictions on cross-border traffic.</p>
<p>The days when Canadians and Americans moved back and forth across the border  &mdash;  &#8220;it&rsquo;s as though there&rsquo;s not a border at all,&#8221; as she put it  &mdash;  are over.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a real border, and we need to address it as a real border,&#8221; Ms. Napolitano said, calling on both Americans and Canadians to accept this &#8220;change of culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>That culture changes most emphatically June 1, when the United States will require anyone entering from Canada to produce a passport or its equivalent.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, whose district encompasses Rochester, Buffalo and Niagara Falls, believes she knows what will happen that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be pure chaos,&#8221; she predicted. Lines will lengthen, people will be denied entry, tourism and business will suffer. And with the addition of the Olympics it&rsquo;s going to be even more so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tourist industry officials are predicting major declines in cross-border traffic, because only about a quarter of Americans carry passports.</p>
<p>States and provinces now offer enhanced drivers licences, which are an acceptable alternative, but in many cases they cost more and take longer to acquire than a passport.</p>
<p>Ms. Slaughter said she plans to introduce legislation to delay implementation of the passport requirement for one year. Although she has been successful in persuading her congressional colleagues to grant a previous extension, those who know the issue said there was virtually no chance of a further delay.</p>
<p>These days, the Canada-U.S. border faces worsening challenges, as a plethora of new charges, regulations and red tape, mostly imposed by Americans in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, amount to the equivalent of a new tariff on goods and services.</p>
<p>This tariff-in-all-but-name leaves manufacturers increasingly concerned that the integrated Canada-U.S. economy could begin to rupture. Some are already looking at contingency plans, such as additional warehouses or alternative suppliers, in case of disruption in delivery cycles.</p>
<p>Campbell Soup, for example, is moving &#8220;from just-in-time to just-in-case,&#8221; warned Kelly Johnston, an executive with the company.</p>
<p>Canadian politicians, and industry leaders on both sides of the border, hoped that the arrival of a new, Democratic administration would lessen the emphasis on security that Mr. Napolitano&rsquo;s predecessor, Michael Chertoff, placed on border relations.</p>
<p>It was on his watch that Congress passed the passport requirements, and it was Mr. Chertoff who vetoed a planned initiative that would have made it easier for goods to pre-clear customs, easing lineups.</p>
<p>Ms. Napolitano confessed that, having lived most of her life in either New Mexico, where she was raised, or Arizona, where she was governor, &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never actually spent much time on the Canadian border,&#8221; though she plans to visit it later this spring and this summer.</p>
<p>To educate herself, she commissioned a study of the border, chastising Canadian journalists who speculated that this was an ominous sign.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ms. Napolitano said she discovered there were differences in the way the two countries screened people and goods, and in their risk-assessment policies.</p>
<p>And there were also differences that were &#8220;nuanced but very real in immigration and visa procedures,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Given these differences, she said, the challenge was: &#8220;How do you make the U.S.-Canada border a futuristic border,&#8221; even as the United States moved to &#8220;change the culture of no-border to border.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day was not entirely discouraging for open-border enthusiasts. Transport and Infrastructure Minister John Baird assured the gathering that a new bridge between Windsor and Detroit, through which one-quarter of all Canada-U.S. trade flows, &#8220;has been and will continue to be the number one infrastructure project for Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Roberta Jacobson, who is Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico and NAFTA at the State Department, said that Canada and the United States should talk about border issues without involving Mexico, the third member of the North American Free Trade Agreement partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one where we ought to start with Canada,&#8221; she said. This has long been the wish of Canadian officials, who believe that bringing Mexico into border discussions prevents agreements in areas where Canada and the United States could work co-operatively.</p>
<p>But Ms. Napolitano doused that idea as well, reminding the gathering that &#8220;one of the things that we need to be sensitive to is the very real feelings among southern border states and in Mexico that if things are being done on the Mexican border, they should also be done on the Canadian border.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to be another lesson learned: when it comes to national security, the Obama administration&rsquo;s policies are often consonant with its Republican predecessor.<br>

			<p>And why should we take it as an article of faith that we have to be as strict on the US-Canada border as we are strict (supposedly) on the US-Mexico border?  It&rsquo;s a non sequitur, because far more undesirable stuff (people and contraband) come up from the south than the north.  If there is any exception to this re Canada, it&rsquo;s 9/11 type terrorists, who take advantage of Canada&rsquo;s uber-liberal immigration system, even worse than the U.S., and the relatively open border with the U.S., to plan terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>Of course, if you believe in racial equality, then we have to treat all borders the same.  Or, more accurately, there should not be any borders.</p>

Of course for the USA to punish Canada while rewarding Mexico is insane. But considering that my main terror these days is that Obama will promote a radical expansion of North American Union that would effectively erase BOTH of America&rsquo;s borders   &mdash;   thereby flooding the entire continent with 100 million Mexicans   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m a little relieved to learn that his administration still believes in the concept of borders AT ALL. </p>
<p>If Obama is showing ANY interest in border enforcement   &mdash;   even in crude or inappropriate or anti-white ways   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s far more reassuring than having him dropping hints about how the entire continent should become &#8220;one big happy family&#8221; or asking &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it time all three of us neighbors tore down our fences?&#8221; or some similar NAU/NWO-enabling evil nonsense. </p>

<i>&#8220;The days when Canadians and Americans moved back and forth across the border &mdash; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as though there&rsquo;s not a border at all,&rdquo; as she put it &mdash; are over.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As someone living on the US-Canadian border, I can tell you we used to have clear access back and forth across the border. They used to require you answer only three questions: place of birth, destination, length of stay.</p>
<p>Of course, those were the days before people lied to cross the border and then took up illegal residence.</p>
<p>Now we have &#8216;enhanced drivers license&rsquo; which is essentially a drivers license/passport.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m torn by this. I grew up going back and forth across the border with only answering three questions. I was always amazed by how easy it was to enter a foreign country. Because of miscreants who broke every rule, those days are gone.</p>
<p>If they have the same requirements on the southern border and they stop illegals from lying and staying, maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing; though I somehow doubt the same requirements are going to apply to the US-Mexican border.</p>
<p>Those in power seem intent doing away with the southern border.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been to Niagara Falls several times&hellip;yes, it was easy to go back and forth.  </p>
<p>Last time we were there was a month before 9/11.  I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like now.  A few years ago, though, my mother went to Ontario for a family reunion (I have Canadian 3rd and 4th cousins) and she said she had no problem whatsoever (she lives in the Detroit area).</p>
<p>In 1990, though, we had some Aussies visiting us and we went to Windsor&hellip;they searched our car and everything.</p>

Posted by Schoolteacher</p>
<p>Formerly, our friends, relatives, and neighbors across the border were once treated as such:  as family,  a closely related people, both culturally and racially.  There was hardly any difference between us.   </p>
<p>But those who are now called &#8220;Canadians&#8221; have changed. Any visit to Toronto or Vancouver will leave you asking: where have all the white people gone?  For quite a few years now, there has  been accumulating along our northern border a huge assortment of third worlders who  (unlike Old Canadians) have nothing in common with us and no sympathy for us. Long before 9/11 happened, I saw and realized that this was going to be a problem someday and would be a threat to the USA. They were building up their presence just a few miles from major US cities, and no one in charge seemed to be noticing   &mdash;    although it was glaringly apparent. (But to notice it would be &#8220;racist&#8221;.)</p>
<p>If Canadians now don&rsquo;t like this new arrangement, well too bad!  Whose fault is it?  Their government&rsquo;s extravagant immigration policies (even worse than ours) have made these restrictions necessary.  It&rsquo;s a situation of their own making. Let them live with it!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, as sbuffalonative says,  &#8220;Those in power seem intent on doing away with the southern border.&#8221;  Strange?  (He&rsquo;s right once again!)</p>

			<p>We do not have an open southern border.  We have a one way sieve pointing north and favoring Mexico.</p>
<p>If the border were open Americans could use coyotes and an underground railroad to invade Mexico and take jobs away from Mexicans and use their hospitals free of charge and their educational  systems free and also treat the political, judicial, and governmental systems as their own.</p>
<p>As this is not happening we need to find better words that more accurately describe the situation.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not white Canadians that are the problem but muslims who have immigrated into Canada that are the problem. Of course it would make common sense to make it tougher for muslims to come into the USA from Canada or not allow them in at all but of course we can&rsquo;t be racist can we???? So we have to treat everyone the same. Also, Mexico has caused problems unlike Canada, so we have every right to be much tougher of Mexico but again, the new political correctness won&rsquo;t let us.</p>

Correction: it was four question.</p>
<p>The fourth was &#8216;do you have anything to declare?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But because of terrorists and &#8216;immigrants&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s no longer that simple.</p>

<p>Yup.  There was a case back in &#8216;04, still in the courts today I think, where an Canadian Amish guy was denied re-entry into the US to be with his American wife since he refused to obtain an ID with photo.  He finally got permission for a short visit, after which the feds almost instantly deported him   &mdash;   within 24 hours   &mdash;   and barred him from re-entering.  That&rsquo;s us   &mdash;   easy on illegal Mexicans, tough on the Amish!</p>

			<p>Contrary to this article suggesting the Canadian-US border is/was near transparent, my experience has been the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the Mexican border which is consistently &#8216;easy&rsquo; to get in to the US as long as you have a national ID of some kind. Virtually no questioning. This is true both personally and direct observation of others while being processed. It is especially true of areas where the border station staff are all Mexican-Americans such as El Paso. I have crossed at various points in Texas and California.</p>
<p>On balance, my personal experience and direct observation of others has been that the US border at Canada is much more rigorous. Being asked minimally required interview questions without ID at the discretion of the agent glowingly described in the article was the exception even in the distant past going back 25 years. More often than not, national ID was demanded sometimes followed by interrogative and intrusive questioning. To their credit though, agents who do more than the minimum including those who give you the &#8216;works&rsquo; were not sloppy like their Mexican-American colleagues. I have crossed at various points in Washington, Michigan, New York and Vermont. Vermont provided the most pleasent experience.</p>
<p>Only going into Mexico can one say a border is transparent. Going into Canada at any part of that long border is as pleasent as the Vermont experience.</p>
<p>This refers personal car or bus trips, or land crossings in general. Airports are a different matter. So too is commercial transport by any method.</p>

			<p>Niagara Falls, it was easy to go back and forth, no ID required.  Probably because it&rsquo;s a tourist trap.  It was easier by car than by walking across the Rainbow Bridge&hellip;I had to show my voter ID to be let back into New York!</p>
<p>Basically we were asked, where were we born, where were we going, how long would we be there.</p>

			<p>I became aware of Canada&rsquo;s liberal immigration policies and their willingness to fling the door open to the Third World by watching The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor and Fox News, who were the only places in the media that payed any attention to this &#8220;demograhic shift&#8221;. Otherwise, it seems, it is ignored by the other news outlets. Canada is undergoing a racial demographic change just as is the U.S. There can be no good that comes of this, as demonstrated by our spikes in crime and other social ills that parallel our own transformation from a White Christian nation into a non-White and non-Christian one. Two books that focus on this phenomenon are &#8220;Metamorphysis&#8221; and &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I live a few minuets across from the Canadian border and have always thought the border agents were quite oppressive. What a contrast the southern border was. My wife and I took a day trip walking into Tijuana, crossing the foot bridge. At the end of the day, when we crossed back into the U.S. I noticed the line in front and behind us was 99% Mexican. You can&rsquo;t even imagine my shock when the U.S. agent didn&rsquo;t even ask the citizenship of any of the Mexicans. I asked him why and his response was &#8220;What&rsquo;s the use?&#8221;. </p>
<p>That was around 1990, 4 years after Reagen&rsquo;s amnesty for Mexicans program assured us the border would be secured. We could see California was already under siege from out of control adolescent Latinos, I can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s like now!</p>

			<p>I lived in Toronto for 20 years - one of the safest, cleanest and most civilized cities in the world (and, at that time, over 80 percent white). To the extent there were pockets of violent gun crime, most of it was committed by blacks from Detroit and Jamaica. Tightening security measures at the northern border might be a good thing   &mdash;   for Canada!</p>

			<p>Back in the early 90&rsquo;s I drove up to Vancouver BC with a carload of my Army buddies on Interstate 5.  I didn&rsquo;t even know that I was supposed to stop at the border so I just drove right by without stopping.  If any government agent along the interstate noticed they didn&rsquo;t seem to care and I wasn&rsquo;t pursued and stopped. We spent the weekend up there and had a good time and decided on the way back that since we didn&rsquo;t stop on the way in that we would be better off not stopping on the way out.   That seems like an age ago now.  I sure wish I could claw my way back through time because the way we are going is just getting darker and darker.</p>

			<p>The problem with Canadians is that many of them are White and English speaking.  It is rumoured that some may even be Christians, and still others may come to our country to obtain free market health care.  Their children tend not to be members of gangs.  We just can&rsquo;t allow those types in our country.  It offends our masters in the UN building.</p>

			<p>As a Canadian I would have no problem at all being required to have a valid passport to obtain entry into the United States. To be honest I&rsquo;m surprised the USA was so lax for so long about its northern border, especially given the recent population changes in Canada. To be fair, there is a world of difference between illegal immigration between Canada and Mexico, but on principle alone I think the USA should have required passports for Canada too. The real problem for the border is along Ontario. The border between the U.S. and this key province (Canada&rsquo;s most populous, where the capital is and the industrial heartland of the country) consists of a number of &#8220;chokepoints&#8221; which is an inevitable result of the Great Lakes barrier. What is really needed are many more bridges, tunnels, etc, to reduce waiting times and facilitate trade. I would mention that Canada is America&rsquo;s largest trading partner. </p>

Good question, Alexandra.   But I doubt it.  </p>
<p>That silly term  (African-American)  seems to have caught on everywhere.  Even in Paris, one sees shops advertising  &#8220;African-American&#8221;  clothing, beauty products, hairstyles&hellip;     Apparently, these people  (in France!) now consider themselves to be &#8220;African-Americans&#8221;   &mdash;    even if they&rsquo;ve never set foot in America.  Nor many of them  in Africa either.</p>
<p>They are a race in search of a name, especially since the perfectly respectable and time-honored N- - - -  (beginning with a capital N) seems to have been banished to linguistic limbo.  (I don&rsquo;t understand why.)   It was the scientific name of a race (not a color, or culture), leaving us with nothing in its place.  That nicely suits the purpose of those who would deny the existence of race to leave us with no word to discuss it.  </p>
<p>However, I learned English a long time ago,  before the era of PC revisions.   I only know Standard English, not Revised English. So, unregenerate fuddy-duddy that I am, I continue to use it defiantly (just as I still speak of Peking and Bombay.)  Until they put me in jail, that is.   :)</p>

			<p>Read Michael Scheuer sometime. <br>
The fact is that whether the border is Canadian or Mexican makes no difference. The sentence &hellip;&#8221;It seemed to be another lesson learned: when it comes to national security, the Obama administration&rsquo;s policies are often consonant with its Republican predecessor&hellip;&#8221; pretty much says it all. The government behind the government is getting serious because time is ticking away before we can expect a really big explosion in the USA. Scheuer implies the Congress and the White House talk a good game but don&rsquo;t in the last analysis really care all that much about the survival of the American People. It is shocking to read it stated as explicitly as that but take my word that is what he says, in essence. I think things are tightening up in the border dept because the intelligence community really has connected the dots and knows we are overdue. Since the government behind the government knows that pushing the public into a panic is counterproductive, we aren&rsquo;t going to see headlines; but I wonder if the talk about &#8220;Socialism&#8221; creeping up on us is just another way of introducing the concept of martial law on the heels of 100,000 dead Americans in Houston (or Chicago) and widespread chaos. </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s see: The Canadians, though socialist, are white and western like me and share my values and are coming to a predominately white country.  The Mexicans, marxists, not white, not sharing my western values, want to take over my country, bring violence into my country along with drugs, child molestation, drunk driving, kidnapping, and corruption.  Which group of people would I rather have more of in my country?  Gee, that&rsquo;s a tough one!</p>

			<p>I lived for a few years in the early 1990&rsquo;s in El Paso, TX. Back then crossing the border was as easy as crossing into your local shoping mall. There was no check to enter Mexico and on the way back into the US, all you had to do was say, &#8220;American&#8221; as you walked across; no ID or passport needed to be shown. I&rsquo;m not sure how it works now, but hopefully they&rsquo;ve made it much harder cosidering the heavy crime taking place in Juarez.</p>

			<p>This woman has no place being the &ldquo;Head&rdquo; of Homeland Security! Her ridiculous sentiments towards Mexico and PC leanings towards the War on Terror are putting all of us at grave risk - nationally and internationally.<br>
Posted by Jackers</p>
<p>Considering that she was Governor of Arizona (of all places), and given what&rsquo;s been going on in that state (plus her views on all that), should be enough to rule her out as completely unacceptable as a guardian of the border! Her competence and views are already well established.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop.<br>

			<p>Many Canadians come across the border into America to buy and pay for Health Care, Canada proved a long time ago that Government Controlled Health Care is a joke and a total mess, offering little to no real service to the people. That nitwit in Washington might be well served to see what it is like in counties that have national Health Care and American Politicians prove day in and day out they foul up ALMOST EVERYTHING they touch or do even though they do it at five times the normal cost?</p>

Of course, we Americans shouldn&rsquo;t feel &#8220;insulted&#8221; because illegal Mexican immigrants are robbing America blind&hellip; legally, with their demands on welfare, healthcare, etc., ILLEGALLY by the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants after they get into our country.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Obama cared that much.  Napolitano was sufficiently open borders enough, and sending her to HLS and out of AZ was the quid pro quo for John McCain rolling over in the Presidential election   &mdash;   Nappy was McCain&rsquo;s biggest roadblock for another Senate term.</p>
<p>Otherwise, to find a new HLS secretary, President Obama found the right man for the job.</p>

			<p><em>Back in the early 90&rsquo;s I drove up to Vancouver BC with a carload of my Army buddies on Interstate 5. I didn&rsquo;t even know that I was supposed to stop at the border so I just drove right by without stopping.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Vancouver all my life; nearly 50 years. The border that is nearest to Vancouver is the Douglas, BC/Blaine, WA border crossing. I&rsquo;ve crossed this border hundreds of times over the years, and folks, you have to stop. There are vehicle lines, speed bumps, kiosks with border guards, barriers, and all sorts of other constructs. If you drove straight through into Canada (smashing your car all the while) without stopping, the RCMP would be stopping you and arresting you. If you drove straight through into the USA, you&rsquo;d probably be shot at by border guards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you enjoyed your stay in Vancouver, but please be honest with yourself   &mdash;  - you had to stop and make at the very least a verbal declaration.</p>
<p>By the way, Blacks in Canada often do refer to themselves as African Canadian. </p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t to keep people out. Well, it&rsquo;s to keep whites out certain places. It&rsquo;s mainly to keep whites from leaving at some point, along with not allowing certain whites back in should they travel. Just another move by Big Brother that&rsquo;s going to backfire when we have CW II. And that is where we are headed, don&rsquo;t kid yourself. </p>

			<p>&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;If Obama is showing ANY interest in border enforcement  &mdash;  even in crude or inappropriate or anti-white ways  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s far more reassuring than having him dropping hints about how the entire continent should become &ldquo;one big happy family&rdquo; or asking &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time all three of us neighbors tore down our fences?&rdquo; or some similar NAU/NWO-enabling evil nonsense. </p>

<p>This is pretty much hitting the nail on the head. But I would like to add that to me it looks like a way to promote the use of &#8220;enhanced drivers licenses&#8221;.</p>
<p>From article &#8221; Tourist industry officials are predicting major declines in cross-border traffic, because only about a quarter of Americans carry passports.</p>
<p>States and provinces now offer enhanced drivers licences, which are an acceptable alternative, but in many cases they cost more and take longer to acquire than a passport.&#8221;</p>

<p>But look at the BRIGHT SIDE, B.I. Obama will very likely be America&rsquo;s ONLY Black president ever. His wasteful spending. The utterly bad staffing choices he made&hellip; It&rsquo;s a safe bet by 2010 Mid-Term Elections, Dems will lose in droves. By 2012 anyone running against him on the Republican side will have an easy time of winning the presidency.</p>

<p> &#8220;blacks in Canada often do refer to themselves as African-Canadian&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> Not really true. Most refer to themselves by their country of origin or ethnic group (I.E. &#8220;Jamaican&#8221;, &#8220;Trinidadian&#8221;, or &#8220;Somalian&#8221;, Etc;). Occasionally they hyphenate this with the add-on &#8220;Canadian&#8221;, but not often. And they are NOT CANADIAN either!</p>
<p>By the way buddy, there are many places in Washington state where you can drive across the unmanned border, especially at night without being noticed. Some years ago I drove into North Dakota after dark and there was a pylon - yes, a PYLON - in the road where the border was. The guards only manned the station (which looked like a little Macdonalds drive-thru) during the day. You were supposed to &#8220;report yourself at the first opportunity&#8221;. Nobody ever did. You could have driven a Panzer division across the border there and nobody would have noticed.</p>

			<p>Richard sorry to spoil your reality but I was driving north on I-5 and we didn&rsquo;t stop either going or coming back. Now you can call me a liar if that makes you feel better but we did not stop either way. Now that was a long time ago for me and it may have been as early as 1988 or 89 but if I remember right you had to pull off the road to go through the border check point.  There was no obstruction of any kind on the main interstate which is why I missed it in the first place.  So I am being honest with myself and with you.  My bet is if you bother to ask a few people you will find that at that time the road was not blocked the way you describe.   </p>

Of course that was 20 years ago, so perhaps your memory is failing a bit. Maybe you were on some other road, which I suspect was the case?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve gone through on the train (NY to Montreal, and though the train stopped at the border, and agents walked through, no questions were asked. Of some, at random, but not of me.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve flown between NY and Toronto various times, though not too recently.  You pass through customs before boarding (amounting to nothing)  and there are no formalties whatsoever upon arrival. (That is not so in flying to Vancouver.)</p>

<p>What you state is very true how blacks refer to themselves in Canada. More often than not black people hyphenate their nationality. This is true for others as well: Italian-Canadian, German-Canadian, etc. However, and this may be a new phenomenon due to the election of Obama, blacks are indeed refering to themselves as African-Canadians. When Obama visited Canada, the press interviewed every black they could find and many called themselves African-Canadians or even African-North Americans, which I found rather absurd.</p>
<p>Driving north on the I-5 into Canada the highway goes straight through and seamlessly joins Highway 99. The last exit takes you into Blaine, WA. Heading north you will pass the US Customs border, drive for about half a mile then you will have to stop at the Canadian border and report to Canadian Customs and Immigration. This was true in 1988 or 1989, and it&rsquo;s true today. Perhaps you travelled during the wee hours of the morning and were waived through the border, but you still had to stop. As I initially stated I&rsquo;ve been through this border hundreds of times and know it like the back of my hand. My memory is sound, and I&rsquo;m talking about this particular crossing (Douglas, BC/Blaine, WA) not some remote outpost in North Dakota or Eastern Washington.</p>
