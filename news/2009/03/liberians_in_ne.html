<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Obama signed an order on Friday extending by 12 months a policy that grants Liberians the temporary right to live and work in the United States, an administration official said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now that the community has been granted another reprieve, its leaders say they will press Congress to provide Liberian exiles with an expedited path to citizenship.</p>

			<p>Every time this delusional narcissist makes a move, I feel like it&rsquo;s one more nail in the coffin of this Republic. I&rsquo;m still stunned that 60 million fools voted for this neophyte  &mdash;  must be the same crowd that votes for American idol  &mdash;  in this case American idle, based on his work habits. We are truly in deep s***. </p>

			<p>I thought the whole point of Liberia was that things didn&rsquo;t work out so hot for them in the United States.   What gives?</p>

			<p>New York has been the garbage can of the world since before the American revolution.  I watched a Seinfield rerun a couple nights ago.  He did one of his &#8220;Did you ever wonder&#8221; things.</p>
<p>He wondered why the Statue of Liberty poem welcomes the &#8220;wretched refuse&#8221; of the earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a message is this&#8221;? said Seinfield &#8221; &#8220;It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re sending a message all over the world.&#8221;  Just stick every disfunctional, defective depraved loser in a boat and we&rsquo;ll take them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best description of our immigration policy I have ever heard.</p>
<p>A further thing would be: Have you ever wondered why after we spend one hundred years civilizing one mass of disfunctional, defective degenerates we invite tens of millions more?</p>

			<p>Funny, Liberia is a country made by africans from the United States.  Now that the offspring of these former slaves have turned the country into a living hell we have to let them stay here.  Liberia is a perfect example of how blacks are not capable of making or keeping a civilized society.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Liberia originally established as a country for oppressed American blacks to rediscover their freedom and roots? And now they&rsquo;re fighting to return to racist old America! It&rsquo;s the familiar modern theme - where whites go, blacks will follow. Where blacks come, whites will leave. Basically, blacks create a mess, and whites have to start anew, then abandon their accomplishments once blacks arrive to mess things up again.</p>

			<p>Well of course, once again &#8220;temporary&#8221; means &#8220;permanent&#8221; in this country. Oh, and expect more to start arriving soon, and staying just temporarily of course.</p>

I was watching c-span this evening and members the Congressional Black Caucus were praising this decision but they also want a great deal more. They essentially want to open our borders to anyone and everyone from Africa and Haiti without restrictions and for any and every reason from war to poverty to oppression to fear of oppression. The list of reasons was long.</p>
<p>The flood gates are about to open.</p>

			<p>From the full article: <i>In 2007, President George W. Bush granted an 18-month extension, which federal officials said would be the last one.</i></p>
<p>Well well, what a coincidence!  Bush timed it so it would expire just after the date he knew he would be leaving office, enabling him to avoid having to go back on his word while sounding tough at the time.  Blame Obama all you want, but Bush clearly just passed the buck on this one.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t possibly do that   &mdash;   according to a story from a few weeks ago, Europe is in need of tens of millions of them to save their economies at this very moment.  Would there be enough Africans to go around if we did this?  How would it look to the world if we hoarded all the Africans, without letting Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have their share?</p>

			<p>  Here we have raising unemployment among Americans, and yet our government seems to want to expand immigration. President Obama and Congress are again talking about &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221; Our immigration policy is a joke. We&rsquo;ve become a geographic entity of convenience rather than a country.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;The unemployment rate there is about 85 percent, and many people there depend on money sent by Liberians in the United States to survive.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You can bet money they will ever be sent back, and after being here over a decade you can imagine how many anchor babies are involved. So predictable, and just another example of the bleeding hearts in power (including Mr. disaster himself, Pres. W Bush) bringing in the 3ird world. </p>

			<p>If the travesty of an appointed black African president isn&rsquo;t rectified the Globalists will seat a Hispanic in the next election, followed by an East Indian, followed by a Red Chinese.  You can count on it&hellip;</p>
