<h1>Federal Minister Says Canada Needs to Get Tough on Immigrants Who Want Citizenship</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Canadian Press, March 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says immigrants who can&rsquo;t speak English or French well enough should be denied citizenship.</p>
<p>Kenney told an immigration conference in Calgary that more efforts need to be made to integrate individuals coming to Canada. He said newcomers should be required to have a working knowledge of either official language.</p>
<p>Kenney said rules are already in place and free language training is made available to new immigrants so there is no excuse.</p>
<p>He also said he wants to find ways of recognizing an immigrant&rsquo;s credentials.</p>
<p>He gave as an example the case of a Syrian obstetrician who has delivered &#8220;hundreds of babies,&#8221; but who has been working as a chambermaid for the last five years.<br>

			<p>A number of years ago, a Chinese-Canadian made a successful push to eliminate birthright citizenship.  I wondered why it took a Chinese-Canadian to do it, didn&rsquo;t any white Canadians think to do this?  I don&rsquo;t know if Mr. Kenney is white, but if he is, then they&rsquo;re finally beginning to catch on.  Slowly though.</p>

			<p>This makes good common sense, as it would rid Canada of many current and wannabe &#8216;citizens&rsquo; who are not productive and have radically changed the fabric of the major cities. But will the government have the guts to push this measure through? It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out how loud the liberal lefties will scream. A good starting point re: Canada&rsquo;s immigration problems, but I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.</p>

			<p>Over the last 25 years, in good economic times and bad, Canada has been permitting 250,000 foreigners a year to settle in the Great White North.</p>
<p>At first it seemed fine.  The tiny smattering of immigrants seemed innocuous.  Some blended in well.</p>
<p>Now that they are reaching critical mass, they are hauling out their national flags, dusting off their allegiences to motherlands overseas, and &#8216;re-discovering&rsquo; their ethnic nationalities.</p>

			<p>Problem with a lot of these language tests is would-be citizens study simply to pass the test rather than achieve the required level of ability. Once they know roughly what questions are going to be asked they can more or less memorize answers. I don&rsquo;t know whether the immigration department has the time or resources to put their English ability through a thorough examination.</p>

			<p>This is a useless, conservative effort to preserve Canada.  Non-whites learning English will not benefit white Canadians, and in fact will only encourage more race mixing.  The only solution to the racial question is the absolute, geographical separation of the white race, that is territories that are exclusively white. </p>
<p>Anything else is just useless fluff.</p>

			<p>Forty years of traitor white politicians have set the stage for the destruction of the once greatest country.</p>
<p>Too little too late.</p>

<p>Is Mr. Kenney looking for another job yet?</p>

Are you sure?  It seems to me that birthright citizenship still exists in Canada&hellip;</p>
