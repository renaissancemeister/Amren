			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nia-Malika Henderson and Carrie Budoff Brown, The Politico, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was a year ago today that Barack Obama, then a candidate for president fearing a divisive racial backlash over his pastor, took to the stage in Philadelphia and said it was time to have a new conversation about race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a choice in this country,&#8221; Obama said that day. &#8220;We can tackle race only as spectacle  &mdash;  as we did in the O.J. trial  &mdash;  or in the wake of tragedy  &mdash;  as we did in the aftermath of Katrina  &mdash;  or as fodder for the nightly news.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is one option. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, &#8216;Not this time.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the year since that speech  &mdash;  through campaign and convention, election and Inauguration  &mdash;  Barack Obama hasn&rsquo;t taken part in the discussion of race in America in any sustained way, the way he did that day in Philadelphia to get out of a campaign jam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Barbara Lee, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the speech was a benchmark that &#8220;set forth a road map on how to look at race within the context of public policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an approach that leaves some of Obama&rsquo;s black supporters wanting more  &mdash;  and some analysts saying Obama&rsquo;s method is something of a cop-out, in a nation where racial questions still burn every day. It was Obama&rsquo;s own Attorney General Eric Holder, in fact, who said the U.S is a &#8220;nation of cowards&#8221; on race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The White House declined to answer why Obama hasn&rsquo;t spoken more, and more directly about race in light of the speech. But speaking more generally, his closest aides in the White House say Obama&rsquo;s approach fits perfectly with his overall approach to race, both personally and on the campaign trail. They say that anyone expecting that Obama would talk repeatedly in racial terms, or be a kind of stern black father figure, in the mold of Bill Cosby, pointing up the ills of black America, will be disappointed.</p>
<p>The presidential bully pulpit isn&rsquo;t likely to be regularly used that way, they say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is the first African-American president, that achievement resonates more deeply with African-Americans,&#8221; said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama and one of his closest aides. &#8220;We met with the [Congressional Black Caucus] and he talked about the importance of nutrition and weight control, because obesity is a huge challenge in the black community and it&rsquo;s easier for an African-American to say that than someone who isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s easier for him to say, &#8216;Pull up your pants.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>But so far, as president, he hasn&rsquo;t waded into any of those discussions, preferring instead to simply serve as a kind of Ã¼ber role model  &mdash;  something Michelle Obama has embraced too, acknowledging that she gives African-American women a different sort of dream to aspire to.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, some black Democrats say they have been surprised the nation&rsquo;s racial conversation hasn&rsquo;t come further since that day in Philadelphia, or that day in Washington two months ago when Obama took the oath of office.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t blame Obama  &mdash;  and in fact, say he&rsquo;s got so much on his plate fixing the economy that it&rsquo;s not realistic for him to lead a deeper national conversation about race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said he&rsquo;s less worried about what Obama says about race and is focused on his policies, which so far, he said, are going in the right direction. &#8220;We are eager to have a conversation. We are just more eager to see progress made on specific policy, changes made in people&rsquo;s lives,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To be sure, Obama has spoken about race since being elected president  &mdash;  though often to black interviewers from black publications, like Ebony or Black Enterprise. He gave his most expansive answer on his view of race to the New York Times two Sundays ago, rebuking Holder on the &#8220;cowards&#8221; comment. During the campaign, he gave a Father&rsquo;s Day speech where he called on black fathers to be present in their children&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>And when he does speak of race, he does it much in the way he did in the Philadelphia speech: saying that education, health care and the economy are &#8220;problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure that people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning out here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think if we do that, then we&rsquo;ll probably have more fruitful conversations.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I believe most Americans avoid discussion on race because intuitively, they know the revealing of unpleasant facts and truths is inevitable. Many know that this never-ending lamentation about &#8220;discrimination&#8221; and all that nasty bigotry that forever haunts Blacks, still cannot and does explain away abhorent Black behavior and the large-scale failures of the Black race. Intelligent Liberals and Obamas know this too.</p>
<p>So how do you really have any meaningful discussions about race?<br>
All the usual suspects will do is moan and groan, blame Whitey, etc., etc. That is NOT a discussion and it accomplished nothing of value. The fact is, discussing race is like discussing religion - and every bit as frustrating and pointless when matters of &#8220;faith&#8221; and &#8220;belief&#8221; are argued against fact, science and statistic.</p>

			<p>Whenever a black man says we need a dialogue on race, it&rsquo;s a trap. What he mean is he wants white people to admit they&rsquo;re racists.</p>
<p>When President Obama guarantees that every white person who speaks freely about race will suffer no job loss, social ostracism, or public condemnation, then we can talk. Until then, a white man talking honestly about race is cutting his own throat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need racial harmony. What I need is for blacks to leave me alone and take care of the problems they create for themselves.</p>

			<p>Just what ARE these &#8220;burning racial questions&#8221;?</p>
<p>For most whites, blacks don&rsquo;t exist unless they&rsquo;re causing a problem&hellip; which is most of the time. That is to say, when blacks go about their business in society like they&rsquo;re supposed to be doing, most whites aren&rsquo;t aware of race.</p>
<p>Blacks by and large, on the other hand, are OBSESSED with race and with their hatred and resentment for white people. One need look no further than the story here a couple of days ago about the three black females who stopped their cars to hassle the white man who was running his hose across the street to water plants in a roundabout. If they were in such a hurry to get somewhere, why stop to hassle him? Maybe because hassling white people is the most important thing in their useless lives&hellip;</p>
<p>Perhaps I would be that way too, were I a member of a race destined to never succeed, that for the most part lacks the reasoning skills and impulse control to function in a civilized society.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve read quite a few Politico articles lately, and I always check a few pages of comments.  Anyone else noticed what total nutcases the leftists there are?  I mean, above and beyond the usual stupidity.  I think I lost a few CCs of white matter just reading their racism and mindless drivel.</p>

<p>Wow, big surprise there. Wasn&rsquo;t the claim for Obama&rsquo;s campaign that he was going to &#8220;transcend race?&#8221; (Of course, exactly the opposite.) So why would anybody  expect him to make race a big part of his presidency? He&rsquo;s taking the easy way out. Besides, if he chided blacks for their own problems they would drop their support of him in a New York minute.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, give blacks more, because they can&rsquo;t achieve anything on their own, but be sure to ALWAYS pretend they can, and listen to them sit back and brag about the freebies as being really black accomplishment in the face of white oppression and racism.  That&rsquo;s part of what blacks mean when the speak of dialogue. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next couple of years when the white/black differences could very well be replaced by Hispanic/black conflicts, after their numerous battles pick up in intensity and numbers and the information can&rsquo;t be ignored in trying to describe why the battles are raging. </p>

			<p>I asked a like-minded friend in our marketing department once, &#8220;Why do you guys over-represent Blacks in your advertising images?&#8221; He responded, &#8220;We&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s because people want to see other people who look like themselves. It supposedly makes them feel enthusiastic about buying when they can self-identify with people who appear as they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very interesting. Whites are told that it is racist to identify with outselves, but for Blacks, it&rsquo;s considered a natural necessity, completely vital to the process of commerce.</p>
<p>My friend and I had that conversation about 11 years ago. Since then, whenever I receive an advertisement that contains images of minorities, I discard it immediately and respond with a natural aversion to whatever product they&rsquo;re peddling.</p>
<p>For example, JCPenney&rsquo;s sent me a catalog covered with interracial pairings in 1998 and I promptly discarded it. I have not been back to their store since. Today, Scott&rsquo;s Lawn Service sent me a flyer with a picture of a young Black child playing on one of their super-green lawns. That offends me because I live in a 100-percent White neighborhood and the scene appeared foreign to me. I could not relate. I discarded it, and I won&rsquo;t be buying any more Scott&rsquo;s lawn-care products, much less having them service my lawn. Frankly, I do not know of any Blacks who would ever pay Scott&rsquo;s Lawn Service to service their lawns. Then again, I do not know of any Blacks who actually own a home, so how could they have a need for that? Obviously, Scott&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t have a clue and I found their flyer highly offensive.</p>
<p>The list of commanies on my permanently-banned list includes:</p>
<p>JCPenney&rsquo;s<br>
Scott&rsquo;s<br>
Tyson Foods<br>
all Black-owned area businesses</p>
<p>Things will not improve in America until we send the correct messages, my friends. Do not buy products from these clueless, offensive idiots. Personally, I think America is permanently doomed.</p>

America doesn&rsquo;t need a &#8220;discussion&#8221; on race. A discussion has no specific objective, no specific result, and no specific end point.</p>
<p>All America needs is some honesty and truth on the subject of race.</p>
<p>Consider this quote, which you might recognize:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;There is not a truth existing which I fear or wish unknown to the whole world.&#8221;</i></p>

			<p>This country is so absorbed with the white and black issues that it is willing to destroy itself in every facet of society from the level of its educational system, to its workplace, to its positions of leadership, all to cater to inferior genes.  At least Obama recognizes that there is nothing to be gained from this constant national dead end obsession with the dysfunctional problems of blacks.  They need to learn to stand on their two feet and to compete like everyone else. </p>

			<p>Dr. James Watson probably knows more about race than anyone else. He spoke on race in an attempt to explain why all of our efforts (mostly financial) to aid countries in Africa have not succeeded. With the spending of so much money in this effort, one would think they would want to know why there has not been much success. How can such efforts succeed in the absense of such information? It was an honest attempt by Dr. Watson to start a discussion on how best to help blacks in Africa. Can anyone tell me how this information was received?</p>
<p>For Mr. Obama and Mr. Holder to complain about whites being hesitant to discuss race is asinine. It reflects their complete lack of understanding on this issue.</p>

			<p>I agree with HH: we have been at a dead end re race for decades, because the premise was false: </p>
<p>eliminate discrimination &amp; blacks will thrive &amp; their cognitive abilities will skyrocket. </p>
<p>I am a progressive &amp; trust me, most progressives know this, but are often intimidated by censorship codes (who wants to be jobless in this economy????).</p>
<p>We need a new approach that acknowledges reality without just going back to the &#8220;good old days&#8221; blacks are still furious about. </p>
<p>Telling blacks they are not as clever as whites &amp; hence must then work very hard at crummy jobs for miserable wages and give up all the race privileges they now have is a non-starter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get creative &amp; figure out a compromise that works.<br>
 <br>
How about ZERO tolerance for crime, no quotas, no &#8220;speech codes,&#8221; no double standards, no subsidizing large low IQ families of any race, &amp; in exchange, lots of help for people who try hard &amp; obey the law but are not up to snuff in a high tech economy?? </p>

<p>Your posting marks the first time I have ever seen someone self-identify as a &#8216;progressive,&rsquo; and at the same time avow a race-realist viewpoint.</p>
<p>I really hope this is a sign of changes to come, and that you represent a new and growing force in American politics.<br>

Realist, I submit to you that the aid to third-world countries and continents is nothing more than a ruse to take the money of responsible, White taxpayers. They take our taxes and give it to pharmaceuticals to solve the AIDS crisis and other problems in Black nations, but the crisis only becomes worse as the drug makers only become wealthier.</p>
<p>The degree of subterfuge in the nation&rsquo;s government is unimaginable.<br>

			<p>I agree with Obama.  We should have a frank and open dialogue about race.  It might begin by acknowledging the incontrovertible fact that blacks in America commit crimes at eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined.  We might acknowledge that black on white crime is many, many times the obverse. We might want to examine the fact that black illegitimacy is several times that of any other racial or ethnic group.  We might look into the fact that these patterns are world-wide and virtually universal. Perhaps we might discuss how blacks have destroyed every city and nation over which they&rsquo;ve gained political control. We might want to examine the fact that black African intelligence quotients are far and away the lowest of any major racial group. And having unflinchingly put all these irrefutable facts out in the open for all to acknowledge, and not before, perhaps we might be able arrive at some reasonable conclusions about how the world might deal with this problem.</p>
