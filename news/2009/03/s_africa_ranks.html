<h1>S. Africa Ranks Among War Torn Countries in Rape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, March 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Only countries at war suffer as much sexual violence as South Africa, Doctors Without Borders said Thursday in a global report highlighting the problem of rape.</p>
<p>&#8220;The figures we have are alarming, but they are just a tip of the iceberg as most cases go unreported,&#8221; said Meinie Nicolai, operational director for the group, known by its French initials MSF.</p>
<p>&#8220;In conflicts rape can be used to humiliate, punish, control, inflict fear and destroy communities,&#8221; MSF said in the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;In times of stability, sexual violence is also a grave problem, devastating health and lives,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Some of the countries that suffer the most rapes include Liberia, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Colombia. On average in those countries, 35 women are raped every day, MSF said.</p>
<p>Although sexual violence is exacerbated in war, MSF says it also affects millions of people living in post-conflict countries or even in stable environments.</p>
<p>In South Africa rape is associated with criminal activity and domestic violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have noticed that rape in societies has become normal, it has become normal to be raped,&#8221; said Janine Josias, an MSF doctor working in Khayelitsha township, outside Cape Town.</p>
<p>Khayelitsha has one of the highest rape incidences in a country where it is estimated that a woman is violated every 26 seconds.</p>
<p>But Josias said a growing number of men were also being raped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen a growing number of males who are victims of rape. Generally boys and men go unrecognised and untreated,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Women still make up the vast majority of victims, however.</p>
<p>In 2007, MSF treated over 12,000 victims of sexual assault worldwide, in both conflict settings and stable environments.<br>

			<p>There is no race on earth that is more criminals overall, in every way, than blacks.  Nor is there another group of people who has such low intelligence generally or non-existent abilities.</p>
<p>Yet the ones in the US want the world to believe they can&rsquo;t get ahead, because they&rsquo;re being held back by whites.</p>
<p>This is one of the greatest, most disgusting lies of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.</p>

			<p>White women are born and raised with a wider scope of knowledge as embedded in the white genome.<br>
This knowledge plays out in the physical movements and charactistics of white females and is the key to understanding why blacks and nonwhites in general sexually pursue and predatorize white women.</p>

			<p>The major question that should be asked here is how has South Africa improved since apartheid?</p>
<p>Second:<br>
Were are all the celebrities and politicians at who opposed apartheid and spoke out against the injustices it has imposed upon the people?</p>

			<p>I see an anomoly in this article. All the countries listed are african exept Colombia.  I live in Medellin Colombia 2 months a year and it has crime statistics lower than most american cities, and this is true beleive it or not. Exept in the really poor barrios of which I stay out of you hardly ever see a black. And about 1/4 of the populace is white latin, descendants of Spanish blood.  Medellin is actually a first world city much different than the reputation it got 20 years ago when the drug lords ran the city. I have never seen even so much as a barfight among locals. Right wing  President Uribe, along with Pres Bush who gave them 4 billion in Plan Colombia has made a huge dent in the crime. However in much of Latin Americas coastal regions it is almost 100% african as they were brought in 100-150 years ago to work the fields. Colombia has several states that are predomently black such as Choco and the states On the carribean sea in which the beach towns such as Cartegena and Santa Marta are located. So, unless this data is very old, or the data is collected almost exclusively from the black areas of the country, I question the inclusion of Colombia in this article. Another variation is if they include Colombia is why not include next door Venezeula under that nut Chavez where the crime is rising off the charts, which is far far more dangerous than Colombia, something is just not making sense here by singling out only Colombia.  Just my 2 pesos!!  KF   </p>

			<p>Some more of that ol Black Magic - Genitals removed while men are alive</p>
<p>Young men are attacked and their genitals cut off while they are still alive; children&rsquo;s throats are slit and their organs removed; and border-crossers are caught with bags containing human heads and sexual organs.</p>
<p>These stories and more are contained in a horror report on the trafficking of human body parts in Mozambique and South Africa, which has unveiled a scary reality: body parts are frequently used in traditional medicine and there is a commonly held belief that such medicine is very powerful.</p>

			<p>Less than one hundred years ago, we used to give thanks every Sunday that we lived in a civilization, not the jungle. Africa was the natural state of nature, and our civilization was the exception. </p>
<p>Today the discussion is framed around civilization (ours) being the natural state, and places like Africa are the anomaly.  Instead of giving thanks, we take civilization for granted.</p>
<p>We cannot fix Africa to be like us.  It never was and never will be. The best we can do is defend ourselves, to not to slide back into the jungle.</p>
