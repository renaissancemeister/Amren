			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Coleman, Telegraph (London), March 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An in-depth report by the online publication WorldNetDaily.com alleged that any negativity surrounding Mr Obama has been deliberately deleted by the online encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Topics routinely &#8220;scrubbed&#8221;, it was claimed, include Mr Obama&rsquo;s alleged ties with such controversial figures as the so-called Weatherman terrorist, Bill Ayers, as well as the religious leader, Rev Jeremiah Wright, even though users had complied with Wikipedia rules requiring them to link additions to credible reports from news outlets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current paragraph on Obama&rsquo;s religion contains no mention of Rev Jeremiah Wright, even though Obama&rsquo;s association with the controversial pastor was one of the most talked about issues during the presidential campaign,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>In the report, which could provide new ammunition for Mr Obama&rsquo;s critics, journalist Aaron Klein wrote: &#8220;A perusal through Obama&rsquo;s current Wikipedia entry finds a heavily guarded, mostly glowing biography about the president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of Obama&rsquo;s most controversial affiliations are not once mentioned, even though those associations received much news media attention and served as dominant themes during the presidential elections last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was also claimed that Wikipedia has forcibly prevented any criticism of Mr Obama&rsquo;s alleged inability to serve as Commander in Chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiple times, Wikipedia users who wrote about the eligibility issues had their entries deleted almost immediately and were banned from posting any material on the website for three days,&#8221; Mr Klein claimed.</p>
<p>In one example of allegedly biased coverage, a user was said to have attempted to add reports over recent controversies surrounding Mr Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate.</p>
<p>But the entry was said to have been removed by a Wikipedia staff member on the basis that the website prohibits &#8220;fringe&#8221; material, according to WorldNetDaily.com.</p>
<p>By contrast, the study found that coverage pertaining to Mr Obama&rsquo;s predecessor George W. Bush is far from favourable.</p>
<p>For instance, issues such as Mr Bush&rsquo;s alleged battle with substance abuse, along with criticism of his handling of Hurricane Katrina, were easy to find on his entry.</p>
<p>Angela Starling, a spokesperson for Wikipedia, denied that the US president had received preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Mrs Starling said that administrators &#8220;are simply people who are trusted by the other community members to have access to some extra tools that allow them to delete pages and perform other tasks that help the encyclopedia&#8221;.</p>

<p>It turns out the edits were being made by an employee of Klein&rsquo;s at his direction.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the Obama place of birth issue, as I&rsquo;ve heard arguments about this on both sides, but to include no mention in the Wikipedia article of Rev Jeremiah Wright in the section on Obama&rsquo;s religion is absurd.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s enough info on the web to show that Wikipedia &#8220;covers&#8221; for certain people and groups. Just hop on to any old search engine and have a look. Compare the info that&rsquo;s featured for any leftist vs any person considered &#8220;right wing&#8221;. Case closed.</p>
<p>Whether or not the story about Klein is true doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. Why? Because in the past I&rsquo;d posted accurate material to Wikipedia, material that didn&rsquo;t tow the leftist line and it was removed. Quickly. And this was accurate, factual material that could not be argued. Material that had even been in the MSM. </p>
<p>All that aside, I have to wonder why people put so much faith in Wikipedia in the first place? Think about it. I woke up and I know to ignore the site. So should everyone else. </p>

<p>This &#8220;Halo Effect&#8221; around The One   &mdash;   in Wiki as elsewhere in the MSM   &mdash;   also extends to all those within his divine orbit. </p>
<p>I just looked up (again) the Wiki entry on Frank Marshall Davis, the dashiki-wearing black communist &#8220;father figure&#8221; and friend of the Obama/Dunham families when Hussein The Younger was growing up   &mdash;   and who apparently had ENORMOUS influence on BHO and his black-supremacist ideology. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that unlike a printed book, Wiki is an ever-shifting, never-finalized entity. What&rsquo;s there today may not be there tomorrow, or vice versa. But as of today, the entry on Frank Davis contains some info on the Davis-Obama connection. I remember checking the same Frank Marshall Davis listing around the election in November and finding NOTHING AT ALL about BHO.</p>
<p>And what info is there now soft-pedals Davis&rsquo; revolutionary far-left ideological orientation, claiming, for instance, that Davis was never Communist Party member. Whether he was a card-carrier or not I don&rsquo;t know   &mdash;   but there&rsquo;s no doubt Davis was an anti-American communist in his head regardless of whether or not he was in his ID wallet. </p>
<p>Read all about Obama&rsquo;s unpleasant and inappropriate &#8220;mentor&#8221; Frank Marshall Davis   &mdash;   and his &#8220;softcore&#8221; pornographic novel &#8220;Sex Rebel: Confessions of a Gash Gourmet&#8221;   &mdash;   here: </p>

<p><br>
But keep in mind that what Wiki says may not be as important as what Wiki DOESN&rsquo;T say! </p>
<p>Of course, AmRen regulars knew all about Wiki&rsquo;s Lefty prejudices from reading Nicholas Stix&rsquo;s excellent AR cover story a few months ago. (And if you HAVEN&rsquo;T read it, then go to the AmRen Archives NOW, because you definitely SHOULD!) </p>

			<p>i don&rsquo;t know why wikipedia has any credibility with anyone, anymore&hellip;<br>
true its good for some non controversial scientific things, or medicine info, but politics and history, forget it. </p>
<p>Like other posters here, I tried to put in a few even mild edits to articles and they were quickly deleted and i was threatened with being banned. </p>
<p>how or why they can get away with it and still convince themselves they have a NPOV (neutral point of view) is both laughable and scary at the same time.</p>

			<p>I think it is pretty easy to see the double standard.  If Wikipedia is going to allow an entry on George Bush&rsquo;s alleged drug abuse, then they certainly should report the UNDISPUTED FACT that Obama was a disciple of Rev. Wright.  Regardless of your stance on the issues, the facts are important.</p>

			<p>Can I suggest that most people on here have no idea how Wikipedia works? Most of you sound like some of the blacks who storm into a city council meeting, speak out of turn about unrelated issues, then complain about how the system is racist and unfair. There are rules to follow about sourcing and presenting a neutral point of view, and often you&rsquo;re unaware of the history of the issue at hand. Go on, keep being an echo chamber until it&rsquo;s your oubliette.</p>
<p>Check out this on Rev. Wright:<br>

<p>Not really. As long as you&rsquo;re a member of one of the &#8220;historically aggrieved groups&#8221; their editors will clean things up or lock up the topic / item. It&rsquo;s been that way for quite awhile. </p>

			<p>The story on blacks murdering whites in Seattle has several mentions of Wikipedia excluding information, changing info or doing things like this regarding Kris Kime being beaten to death by a gang of black thugs:</p>
<p><b>At Wikipedia, the original May 10, 2005 article about the riot clearly described the racial nature of the riots, but it was quickly removed by censors and replaced with a vaguely worded, 39-word stub that mentioned nothing about race. The current version says the riot&rsquo;s racial character is a matter of dispute.</b></p>
<p>Dispute? There&rsquo;s no dispute. It&rsquo;s the MSM and those who control sites like Wikipedia who want whites to think there&rsquo;s a dispute. </p>

<p>If indeed that is what they are attempting, they&rsquo;re not trying very hard. Any encyclopedia-type of venture like Wiki that was REALLY dedicated to being &#8220;an unadulterated source of factual information&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t display so much OBVIOUS bias and OBVIOUS distorting and &#8220;tailoring&#8221; of the facts to suit an OBVIOUS agenda. </p>
<p>For proof of this, one need look no further than the two entries mentioned in the article: a fawning portrait of Obama versus a critical one of GW Bush. There are, of course, hundreds of other examples of such biases throughout Wiki   &mdash;   but those two entries alone should be enough to convince anyone </p>
