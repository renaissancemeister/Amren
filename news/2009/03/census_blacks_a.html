<h1>Census: Blacks Are Moving to the South</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lorraine Ahearn, News-Record (Greensboro, North Carolina, March 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both North and South Carolina were among the top 10 &#8220;influx&#8221; states gaining in African American migration from 1995 to 2000, according to Brookings Institution scholar William H. Frey&rsquo;s analysis of the 2000 U.S. Census. And cities such as Chicago, New York and Los Angeles lost black residents in significant numbers for the first time in the 20th century.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the last census, the emigration from the North and California had doubled the 1990 census, which had tripled the 1980 numbers. Bottom line? From 1975 to 2000, the Northeast, Midwest and West lost 800,000 black residents to emigration; and of those, about 635,400 moved to the South.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The South is luring Northerners of all stripes  &mdash;  black, white, Asian and Hispanic  &mdash;  for economic reasons that include lower housing costs and property taxes and more affordable college tuition.</p>
<p>But for African Americans in particular, there is also a historical layer in the migration. The choice of cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Greensboro for well-educated African Americans such as N.C. A&T; business professor Olenda Johnson is creating a new professional and middle class.</p>

			<p>As a white American, this is great news: The self-segregation of Americans serves the long-term interest of whites by protecting whites from interracial violence and creating defacto white homelands.  Also, considering the South is overwhelmingly conservative, the movement of blacks to Southern states will hurt left-wing Democrats in nation-wide elections.  Black votes will not be enough to put most Southern states in the Democratic column and black votes will be &#8220;wasted.&#8221;<br>
However, as a Southerner, this upsets me for obvious reasons.  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing that blacks are leaving all areas of the US to live in a centralized location but I feel for Whites living in the Deep South.  However, around 600,000 in 25 years is a drop in the bucket.  I would have have thought it would be alot more considering how the South has changed.  It must be due more to higher black births than migration.</p>

			<p>The weather is also warmer.  I know of a black woman who moved to Ohio from the south and she complains constantly about how cold it is.</p>
<p>Seems that blacks are acclimated to warmer climates, am I right?</p>

			<p>I suppose this is more evidence for the common wisdom that the north is the promised land for blacks, free of racism, segregation, etc?</p>
<p>But we all know that southerners are wicked, stupid, vile, racists.  That must be why blacks keep trying to get close to us.</p>

<p>Great&hellip;.. just great.  I am about to step on some toes by saying what I am about to say, but quite frankly I don&rsquo;t care anymore.  As a white southerner I am oddly enough much more tolerant of blacks moving down here than any of those other groups.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because historically blacks were down here anyways. They don&rsquo;t belong up North creating havoc for the whites who live up there.  </p>
<p>Secondly, if they come down here, the whites down here can easily deal with them and separate from them as we always have.  Done deal.</p>
<p>What irritates me is when people who aren&rsquo;t even originally from this area move down here.  The white migration from North to South is causing the South to disappear, and as a Southerner I am getting sick and tired of it.  </p>
<p>The reason I am targeting Northern whites over everyone else is because Northern whites are more likely than any other group to mix in with us and change us for good. Not to mention the fact that you bring your snobby liberal ways down with you.  Please do us all a favor and stay in your Northern &#8220;paradises&#8221; and leave the rest of us alone.  Let us fly our Confederate flags as we wish and stop turning our states blue. </p>
<p>Also, the South is unique in that the majority of whites down here can trace their lineage back to the Revolution. With this constant North to South white migration going on we are losing our homogenous genetics as Southern whites more and more.  We are becoming less British and more polyglot.  </p>
<p>I am not being divisive; I just think regional variations within our race should be preserved.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to see Spain turn into Germany because of migration.  I also wouldn&rsquo;t want to see Argentina turn into an Anglified, waspy, country due to immigration.  </p>
<p>So please, if you are a Northern white, please explain to me what it is that compels you to constantly migrate down here?  Why can&rsquo;t you just leave us alone just as we leave you alone?</p>

			<p>This reminds me of something I think I posted last year  &mdash;  an indicator of this kind of migration that I have noticed.</p>
<p>Here are the sure signs you can spot as you drive on (southern) roads:</p>
<p>1. Out-of-state license plate [especially out of the Southeast, as in NY, Illinois,                          California], combined with:<br>
2. Tinted windows [  &mdash;  what is it about africans and tinted windows? The correlation is staggering, in my observations over the years around the metro Atlanta rat-maze. It begs the question: what are they so afraid of, that no one must see them in a vehicle?   &mdash;  seems weird, creepy, anti-social&hellip;]</p>

			<p>I doubt all blacks will move south. Here in Canada, we&rsquo;ve been hit by Somali &#8216;refugees&rsquo;, and although I can&rsquo;t say it looks like they enjoy the winter weather (still below freezing where I am, and it&rsquo;s almost April), I doubt they&rsquo;ll return to Somalia or move south. Somalis are a different breed of black, I find. They deliberately move to colder locales. That&rsquo;s why Minneapolis now has the biggest concentration of Somalis in the world outside of Somalia, and don&rsquo;t forget about the Somali invasion of Lewiston, Maine. Maybe some blacks will move south, but don&rsquo;t count on all of them doing that.</p>

			<p> The last poster &#8220;Courtney&#8221; wants to know: &#8220;why are so many whites heading south?&#8221; </p>
<p> Its real simple: Alot of northern whites head south to improve or preserve their econonomic situation. You get alot more bang for your buck in the south. Some of those transplants are being driven out because they&rsquo;re practically taxed to death! Native sons of the south take my word for it &#8220;its financially brutal up there in the northeast&#8221; and where I lived was no exception.  Unless one is financially abundant the costs can be crippling.</p>
<p> When you get a chance Courtney, have a conversation with someone from a state like New York, Massachussetts or New Jersey about costs and taxes. They might quote figures you&rsquo;d find hard to believe.  Make no mistake,financial improvement/preservation is &#8220;by far&#8221; the number one reason why many northern whites are heading south. Have some sympathy. How would you feel if you were priced out of the southeast and wound up in lets say, Connecticut? Some of these whites would of stayed put if they could have,- like me.</p>

			<p>When you consider that there are over 40 million blacks in the US a mere 600,000 is not even worth mentioning.  Are they trying to make us feel better or what?  I live in Chicago, no shortage of blacks here and there never will be.  </p>

			<p>I live in Mpls and have had much interaction with Somalis. Thir appearance is unique; some have wavy, some almost curly hair, not Afro-type hair. Many of the women have almond eyes, thin straight noses, and small lips. It is too bad about the Muslim religion messing up the picture, but I am happy to report the level of religiosity seems rather subdued. The girls wear Levis and sneakers under their robes. The Somalis in general would rather be around whites than american blacks.  <br>
 I have a feeling many of the young, especially females, would just as soon forget about religion altogether, but can&rsquo;t.  All this is not to say, though, that the Muslim angle won&rsquo;t bear evil fruit. There have been reports of young men from Mpls. being recruited into AlQuaeda. If this proves to be a widespread thing I expect friction with the authorities, and the larger community will increase. Personally, my biggest gripe is with the idiotic american church types who go out of their way to use the larger community as a dumping ground. We must foot the bill for their sanctimonious efforts and are never consulted.</p>

I listen to black talk radio and many a guest and caller <b>fondly</b> reminisce about growing up in their home states in the south.</p>
<p>They never seem to connect the &#8216;bad old days&rsquo; with their pleasant recolletions of &#8216;home&rsquo;. They don&rsquo;t seem to see the disconnect. I&rsquo;ve never heard one of them say, &#8216;that place was so bad, I&rsquo;ll never go back&rsquo;. Makes me wonder&hellip;<br>

<p>The tinted windows are so the police can&rsquo;t see the driver holding a pistol down low as the window comes down, many officers are shot under those circumstances.</p>

<p>What if an Amren reading, Northern white like me moves down there?  I figure if you don&rsquo;t fly your Confederate flags it would be like moving to Florida and never seeing any alligators.  What would be the point?</p>
<p>I live in the People&rsquo;s Republic of New York and if my job wasn&rsquo;t here I&rsquo;d move in a minute.  Just <i>try</i> to get a gun here.  You need a permit from the county police to get a pistol, and they inform you that it will take six months.  They don&rsquo;t say &#8220;six months&#8221; because it really takes that long to fill out a couple of forms and do a background check.  It takes six months because that&rsquo;s the police department&rsquo;s way of saying to people who want to be able to defend themselves, &#8220;F*** you!&#8221;.  Of course the local branch of MS-13 (present because of our town&rsquo;s &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; policy) has no trouble obtaining armaments. </p>
<p>I am enough of a &#8220;snob&#8221; that I prefer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0xbY-50NAw" rel="nofollow">listen to Bach</a> and <a>Thomas Tallis</a> rather than Country &amp; Western.  However, I&rsquo;m not about to tell other people what music they should listen to so long as it&rsquo;s not rap played through a 500 watt stereo system on a car cruising through my neighborhood.  (By the way, although I am an agnostic, the links above show two reasons why I have no desire to join in the ACLU&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1731879/posts" rel="nofollow">unrelenting attacks on Christianity</a>.)<br>

I hear you.  At least blacks can legitimately claim some connection to the South and, once down here, stick to themselves.  White Northern immigration is what&rsquo;s destroying the South.  Why do you think Virginia and North Carolina - two of the South&rsquo;s whitest states - voted for Obama?  Because of Yankees.  I realize that most Yankees here in AmRen would respect our heritage if you moved down here, but please tell your liberal neighbors to stay out.  There is nothing worse than liberal Yankees, not even blacks.</p>

			<p>Courtney, don&rsquo;t you realize that the Yankees come down here to try to help pull us poor, illiterate Southerners out of the mire of ignorance, since they (the Yankees) are the only enlightened people in the entire universe? Just kidding&hellip;I think you have made a very interesting and thought-provoking post here.  But I clearly don&rsquo;t want to see the South more overrun by blacks than it is already. It is interesting, though, that in addition to the points made about climate, they seem to be fleeing from the land of the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; egalitarians, those same folks who fought a war to free them (* chuckle *).</p>

			<p>The blacks moving South tend to be the better educated blacks.  And black in big northern cities are already more socially dysfunctional than Southern blacks.  So basically this isn&rsquo;t helping the north as much as it might sound.  The cities where blacks are leaving are just getting filled up Hispanics and other immigrants.  </p>

			<p>I wonder if it would be possible (political correctness allowing) to map a corresponding &#8216;crime chart&rsquo; to this black migration. The theory being that areas that see a black population decline see a corresponding crime decline while the reverse is true for the areas getting more blacks. Just curious, although I am pretty sure already what the results would actually show. Basically I just see the &#8220;high crime rate&#8221; following the black migration movement around.</p>

			<p>Whats good for rest of the country, getting rid of the blacks in other places is playing havoc here in NC as more and more return, along with all the welfare babies being born. My once pretty small Mayberry like town is now 62% black, and they run everything. My cousins neighboring county is 80% black. The schools in his county are 89%, and the whites, all but the poorest have to send their kids to private school. So far although we have a lot of thefts we are not having any more than the normal amount of violence associated with blacks,, ie,, not yet like Detroit where a white man need not tread.  I feel so sorry for the parents not able to afford private school.  Property taxes are going up as land values go down. Unnecesary new local government jobs are being created for the black bosses. And,, possibly with the help of the returning blacks, NC went democratic, for messiah Obama for the first time in my memory.  Wake up America,, this is the future!!!   </p>

<p>As a Michigan native living in Ohio, I wouldn&rsquo;t move south because it&rsquo;s too hot.  LOL</p>
<p>BTW I had an ancestor who fought in the Revolution, and he was from Maryland.  And he was an Adams&hellip;a distant cousin of John Adams.</p>
<p>Not all of us Yankees are liberals.  I believe the southern states had every right to secede for whatever reason.  And I&rsquo;m descended from at least two Union Army vets.</p>
<p>Weather aside, I&rsquo;d probably feel right at home in the South because I&rsquo;m very conservative, very traditional.</p>

			<p>Once again the scholars on race in America have no idea of the stupidity of their notions. I know the reason for black southern immigration and it is  none of the generic reasons asserted herein.<br>
     Frantic parents are sending their kids south to live with grand parents to get them out of ghetto schools and street gangs. We have a high school in Kissimmee called Gateway. It now boasts the same street gangs as NYC or South Philly. These kids bring their ethos with them and God help the poor white kid sitting next to them. The average black or brown kid from Philly is three years behind his white counterpart academically. This makes hatred and confrontation unavoidable.<br>
     The parents believe that discipline in southern schools is some kind of magic to straighten out thier rapping, gang banging off spring. Of course with the onslaught of nihilistic, violent teenage hoodlems our historic discipline has broken down to the extent that the last three principals have been asssaulted by students or parents of students.<br>
     We are twice blessed. We have black and Neo-Rican kids flooding down from Ghettoville High and an equal number of native born Bouriquans heading Norte a escuela in Osceola County. The only way to define our schools is with the concept of multi-cultural sewer. We are indeed blessed.<br>

			<p>I am from the Midwest and I admire the traditional South a great deal. The school push this superiority complex up here solely because of slavery in the south. As a kid, I know I was encouraged to hold negative attitudes toward the south. We were certainly taught to view the Confederate flag as offensive. Take heart, as I got me exposure to real blacks as a result of the late &rsquo;80s welfare migration into Minneapolis every bit of anti-Southern school propaganda melted away in short order. Now on the very rare occaision that I see a Confederate flag on a vehicle on the road, I feel at least a bit of admiration for whoever it is that also sees through the smokescreen.</p>

			<p>To the Northerners who answered my post, thank you.  I feel for you and what you are going through.  But quite frankly, all of us whites, no matter where we are from have our own problems to deal with.  Running and fleeing to another part of the country doesn&rsquo;t do anybody any good.</p>
<p>Also, if it were just a few of you coming down here, and if you all thought the way the people on Amren do, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so irritated.  But because you guys are basically swamping us, it is getting really hard for me to feel sympathy even for the few of you who come down here and respect our culture. Sorry but this is how life works.</p>
<p>If you want the South to survive, then stop coming down here.  Stay in your own states and deal with your own problems. </p>
<p>One of you asked me to put myself in your shoes with your high taxes and all.  Well, why don&rsquo;t you put yourself in our shoes down here?  Is it really our problem that you are going through what you are going through, enough that we should allow ourselves to be displaced by you?</p>
<p>Does anybody know where to find information and statistics on what percentage of the white population in the South still traces it&rsquo;s lineage to the Confederacy?  </p>

<p>That is a bit hurtful, though you maybe right. Just remember the south used to be blue until a few decades ago. I am a Californian that moved to Atlanta 12 years ago. I am planning to get out of the metro area and move to a really small town. I can&rsquo;t stand being around so many blacks, yet I truly do love the Southern culture. Fly your flags, defend our gun rights, it&rsquo;s all good. The true Southerners just have to defend their culture and not conform to the PC attitudes from the Yanks that infiltrate. </p>

<p>If trends continue, this culture of ours that you admire so much will be no more.  And now it isn&rsquo;t just the cities but you guys are moving to the small towns also?  When does it end?  Can&rsquo;t you let us retain something for ourselves?  I am not directing this at you inparticular, but considering that so many of you are doing this to us, you have got to understand my anger and frustration.</p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m not sure which part of the South you reside in, but I can tell you from direct experience that Blacks migrating to the South during the &#8216;90&rsquo;s and 00&rsquo;s has been a REALLY bad thing.  They do not &#8220;keep to themselves&#8221; and we do not have it &#8216;under control&rsquo;, etc&hellip;  In Atlanta in 1989 there were clear boundaries between black and whites&hellip;there were entire areas along the North side of Atlanta where you hardly ever see a black face.  There were school systems that were over 90% white.  However during the migratory period referenced in the article this changed virtually overnight.  Clayton County (to the south of the metro Atlanta area) became a ghetto in the space of 5-7 years. Stone Mountain was a lily-white suburb in 1985&hellip;by 1995 it was almost 90% black.  Alpharetta and E. Cobb were two of the whitest areas around even as recently as five years ago, but now one can see the signs of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; creeping in like the kudzu.  Now there are no safe havens from non-whites&hellip;even Lake Lanier is seeing a small movement in the greater demographic shift.  </p>
<p>   I would MUCH rather have an influx of Northern Whites than anything else&hellip;</p>

			<p>&#8220;It now boasts the same street gangs as NYC or South Philly. These kids bring their ethos with them and God help the poor white kid sitting next to them. The average black or brown kid from Philly is three years behind his white counterpart academically.&#8221; Charles B. Tiffany</p>
<p>  Of course, Charles Tiffany is correct in his post. Some of the increased crime activity in my small town has been linked to &#8220;youths&#8221; from NYC, DC, and South Philly. We have a certain percentage of bad blacks down here, and their numbers are being increased by these unwanted Northern &#8220;gangsta&#8221; thugs.  </p>

			<p>Yes, I loathe Yankees.  Yes, OF COURSE ethnic nationalist Yankees of European descent are excepted, and of course I accept them as comrades.  I&rsquo;ll take an ethnic nationalist Yankee of European descent over the &#8220;culturist&#8221; post-modern &#8220;Confederate&#8221; &#8220;conservative&#8221; types any day.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I loathe Yankees, in general.  They flee the environment their kind has created for themselves, and they bring the mental diseases that are to blame with them, along with a smug sense of superiority, a dislike of southerners (other than Yankee-in-Southerner-clothing types), and a general lack of manners.</p>

			<p>A little known phenomenon is Northern Blacks moving here to the South and taking a lot of public and government jobs in schools, offices, etc - thus MANY local Whites are being shut out of these jobs because of affirmative action policies.</p>

			<p>America is going to change radically in the next few decades.  </p>
<p>If what we long for is a more polite, friendly society, more outdoorsy, with a wonderful culture and traditional mores, we can create all of that in the new communities to be formed in the future.  America&rsquo;s current lifestyle is unsustainable because of our country&rsquo;s debt, and things will change.  </p>
<p>When those on the public dole no longer receive their benefits, and our government can&rsquo;t afford to pay all the police necessary to keep the peace, many white Americans will move to newly created small towns to be among like-minded people.  (This is what I see for the future!)  </p>
<p>Large cities filled with angry, rioting non-whites will not be where you want to commute to earn your salaries.</p>

<p>Many demographic experts predict this will occur in the US because of the (projected) huge increase in crime.</p>
<p>You will likely see &#8220;fortress neighborhoods&#8221; that have department stores, grocery stores, movie theatres, schools, and private armed security (probably something similar to &#8220;The Villages&#8221; in Florida).</p>

			<p>Whites-both northern and southern-need to unite! There are enough northern Whites like myself who loves my race enough to want us to be united so as to beat back Affirmative Action!  southern and northern Whites built this country!!!! We&rsquo;re all we got so let&rsquo;s appreciate each other.  I love my northern heritage as well as those who love their confederate heritage.  I love the southern culture of the aforementioned guns and flag waving.  I hate seeing Blacks who demand we respect their Black History Month while at the same time trying to cast aspersions on the confederate flag and those Whites who want to honor their White forefathers who fought for the South.  We must unite as never before!</p>

			<p>  I can understand the disgust that some Southerners feel toward liberal, white, ex-Californians.  I cannot stand liberals here in &#8220;sundered California.&#8221;  They have been the enablers of a lot of the immigration invasion by sticking up for illegal aliens and &#8220;DIE-versity!&#8221; Having said this there are many conservative, white Californians that would love to leave &#8220;Hellifornia.&#8221; <br>
  Not all whites that relocate to the South think they&rsquo;re &#8220;superior&#8221; to the natives. Rather than griping about &#8220;white, California refugees,&#8221; seek out conservative, white newcomers and help teach them your history, manners, and accents?  </p>

			<p>What is it with these blacks? I always notice that they NEVER build much of anything on their own they just lie in wait until some non-black builds up an area, business, etc. then make demands for what is their right to share in it. Then as they increase in numbers and start to take over what was once a Nice Situation goes downhill fast. At this point they look for another New Non black area to invade. It&rsquo;s never ending. My question is DO blacks EVER DO &#8220;ANYTHING&#8221; TO (HEP) THEMSELVES or are they really just destined by their genes to be parasitic?</p>

<p>Yes, very true. I live in Stone Mountain, I was the clueless white woman from California that thought it was okay to buy a house out here because the neighborhood was mostly white.</p>
<p>Now it is getting bad in my area, there are some nice expensive houses but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Baggy pants wearing gold-grilled thugs are hanging out at the local gas stations and stores. Bullet proof glass going up all over. It is horrid. They get worse and seem more threatening all the time. That is why I want to move to a small town and be around people I can trust.</p>

			<p>Hi Courtney,</p>
<p>Great to see you again!   </p>
<p>I am from the Northeast, as you may remember from our conversations on the boards, and, for my part, I firmly pledge to you that I will not move to the South barring the most extenuating or improbable circumstances (i.e. secession with Jared Taylor appointed the confederate president!) </p>
<p>For one, while from a personal perspective it seems like an easier and more affordable existence, because of the warmer non-European climate and the larger and apparently growing number of blacks, it also seems like a much more adverse condition for long term lineal survival.  For example, it seems pretty clear in my mind, not to mention the minds of all the major twentieth century racialist theorists, that miscegenation, to mention only one degenerate tendency, is encouraged and not discouraged by the warmer climates.   Here the black is, indeed, in his element.  His migration there indicates this.</p>
<p>And while the more religious culture of the South would seem to constitute an implicit tribal barrier toward this particular trend, with the shameless pandering every church of every denomination has conducted toward multiculturalism, the Churches, have, for lack of a better term, effectively fallen into apostasy, so that while they may continue to more or less segregate the races for all practical purposes, if only unintentionally, they are now unsuccessful in promoting white fertility.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s harder to &ldquo;inspire&rdquo; (in a real way) the flock when you are effectively incorporating the liturgy of Martin Luther King in your sermons or, in the best case scenario, when you are such a tiny voice compared to the rest of a rapidly degenerating society.</p>
<p>At this point, in my view, the South&rsquo;s culture of conformance, unquestioning patriotism, unshakeable allegiance to what at any time purports to be the religious and conservative party, disproportionate adoration of football and team athletics and even their religiosity, in short her more collectivist culture, once a source of civic strength and racial health, sadly, now works against her for reasons too obvious and perhaps painful to enumerate.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the liberalism of the Northeast, as despicable and incredibly offensive as it is, because of the Northeast&rsquo;s favorable climatic and demographic conditions, is a more artificial and survivable threat in the long term when compared to the problems faced by the South.  Though of course, as you know, the problem is massive and difficult everywhere.  Even in Denmark and Finland!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to forgive me for not being too sentimental on these matters because though I greatly admire many aspects of the Old South (and certainly more than a few contemporary Southerners: Sam Dickson, Jared Taylor, James Edward, yourself, to mention a few) in truth, this culture is a blip in the history of our people.  Racial Anglo Saxons themselves are a blip in the history of our people.  Even the fabled Normans, to the extent that Southerners are of this stock and not the former (a people to which I myself am traceably descended) are a blip in the history of our people. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shared this view with you before, in one form or another, on this board or another, but to reiterate, nevertheless, as cogently as possible: Personally I believe we will have to be adaptable and not cling too fast to bygone days lest we perish of heartache.   It&rsquo;s perhaps best, instead, to find the advantages and excitement in the changes that are happening outside of our control.  And certainly, in this late hour, unity not divisiveness should be our goal.  But I bet you&rsquo;ve heard lectures on that so I&rsquo;ll kindly abstain from beating the dead horse!</p>
<p>Southerners you are welcome in Massachusetts any day and for any duration but, of course, we will understand if you prefer your wonderful weather, charm, gentle manners and beautiful country sides (and find our damn liberals intolerable.)  While I will, preferably with your blessings, continue to enjoy the South as a visitor and admirer.   And feel grateful that in my lifetime she at least in some part existed.</p>
<p>Again, Courtney, great to see you again and best wishes as always!</p>
<p><br>
Regards,</p>
<p></p>

			<p>I have lived around this country working for a mobile health registry to help pay off student loans.  The real difference among people in this country isn&rsquo;t north vs. south or East Coast vs. West Coast, etc.  I have met a number of rude southerners who were hostile for no apparent reason.  The real difference is between urban areas vs. rural areas.  Urban sprawl makes people meaner because it is just too easy to be rude to someone we think we will never see again.  </p>
<p>I can see why black Americans would want to live in the south.  For one thing I don&rsquo;t think they like cold weather.  Another thing is that so far the south is made up mostly of black people and white people so black people face less competition for racial entitlement programs in the south.  In other parts of this country there are just too many other races cutting in on what black people consider their pie.     </p>

			<p>I know of many people here in the North who are migrating to the south, especially Florida.  Many of them live there during the winter then come back up here to see their families during the warm months.  One man who moved down to Florida described how they make houses by an assembly line method.  They turn out houses the way Hershey&rsquo;s turns out Hershey&rsquo;s kisses.  In the course of a week they can build a brand new neighborhood.  This allows gazillions of Northerners to come south.  Remember the movie: &#8220;If you build it they will come.&#8221;  If you allow the big builders to build houses by the hundreds, you will continue to have scores of northernors pouring into your communities.</p>
<p>If Southerners were to have a stop the sprawl movement, the migration of Northerners would slow down because they need homes, if they do not have homes, they will not come. The big construction companies create the supply which in turn creates the demand for more Southern housing.  </p>
<p>There are many people now who are concerned with the endless sprawl that is gobling up the countryside.  Even many liberals are against sprawl.  Hopefully Southerners will partner with others who want to stop sprawl and you can stop much of this wholesale destruction of communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you built it they will come&#8221; also applies to some of the negative types of black person.  Don&rsquo;t build any more housing projects or subsidized housing.  Don&rsquo;t allow Section 8 housing in your communities. When possible demolish the housing projects that already exist.  Do away with the LBJ ghettos.  In other words stop putting out the welcome mat for all the riffraff.</p>
<p>Stop the sprawl.  &mdash;  Save the drawl. ;^D</p>

<p>I am not so sure about that.  1,000 years (and counting) is hardly a blip. Not to mention the many great achievements of this branch of our race (this nation and it&rsquo;s Constitution being one of them).  I think every branch of the white race has produced great achievements and I also think each branch should be preserved.  But the Anglo Saxons are one of the last groups I would refer to as a &#8220;blip&#8221; in our history.</p>
<p>I am glad you feel comfortable in your Northern culture and climate. That is how it should be.  I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my Southern heritage for the world, and neither should you want to trade yours. Our race has many varied groups and subcultures and I think they should all be preserved.</p>
