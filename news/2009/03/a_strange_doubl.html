<p>When Martha Sandweiss sat down to research the life and times of Clarence King, it took her 10 minutes to find out she had struck gold. She knew going in that King, a prominent 19th-century Ivy League-educated geologist, author and explorer, who counted U.S. Secretary of State John Hay and the writer Henry Adams among his friends, had an enormous secret he was keeping from his high-society friends.</p>
<p>What she didn&rsquo;t know, but quickly found out, was that this secret prompted him to live two lives: the first, as the first director of the United States Geological Survey, a gregarious friend of powerful people, who occasionally dined at the White House; the second, as a black Pullman porter named James Todd who was married to a black woman named Ada Copeland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m the first person to figure that piece of it out,&#8221; Sandweiss says from her Amherst, Massachusetts home. &#8220;What people knew before was only that the famous Clarence King had a 13-year relationship  &mdash;  whether it was a marriage or not  &mdash;  with this African-American woman and that they had several children together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandweiss, a professor of American studies and history at Amherst College, had been urging her students to look into the story of King&rsquo;s secret marriage, propelled by the indignity she felt upon reading a 1958 biography of King that barely mentioned Ada, or dismissed her as an undignified aberration. None of her students took her up on it, and this aspect of King&rsquo;s life kept gnawing at her. When she finally sat down and discovered his dual identity  &mdash;  thanks to the recent digitization of American census records  &mdash;  she decided this was a story she would write herself.</p>
<p>The result, <cite>Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line,</cite> is a staggeringly researched, absorbing and page-turning account of a stunning deception carried out by a complex man who believed that miscegenation was where the future of the white race lay. As Sandweiss writes, King believed mixing the races &#8220;would improve the vitality of the human race and create a distinctly American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say two things about his racial views,&#8221; Sandweiss says. &#8220;One, his sort of romantic racialism and his fascination with &#8216;primeval women and women of colour&rsquo; is somewhat distasteful to me. But his other views about race were truly radical. There&rsquo;s that extraordinary piece he writes three years before his marriage to Ada in which he says there can&rsquo;t be an American style  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s writing about some architectural designs for Grant&rsquo;s tomb  &mdash;  until there&rsquo;s an American people, which won&rsquo;t happen until there&rsquo;s no more English and German and Negro and white. That kind of thinking in 1885 was almost unimaginable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Odd then that he would hide his marriage, but King, who was born in 1842, was a very smart man and knew his influential white friendships and his career would never survive such a revelation, a fact borne out after his death in 1902 when his relationship with Ada was discovered and hushed up by those friends who felt they were serving the best interests of King&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>As for Ada, she believed her husband had left her a trust fund  &mdash;  in a deathbed confessional letter to her, King revealed his real name, but it&rsquo;s unclear if he revealed his race, his profession or family background as well. In any event, he died penniless  &mdash;  Hay took it upon himself to buy her a house and send her a monthly stipend, all of which he did anonymously. When Hay died in 1905, his family continued the payments, all, Sandweiss writes, &#8220;to prevent Ada from speaking about her relationship to their famous friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of this ended in 1933, with a court case instigated by Ada in a bid to get what she thought was the entire amount of the trust fund. Sandweiss thinks that by this time  &mdash;  and there is much in this book Sandweiss has had to deduce, given the scarcity of material about Ada&rsquo;s life  &mdash;  she likely had a pretty good idea that her husband was not black. &#8220;The ferociousness with which her husband&rsquo;s defenders attack her and seek to prevent her from finding the source of her money, I think had to begin suggesting to her that he was a white man and that he had very powerful friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>But how, one may well wonder, could a fair-skinned, blond-haired, blue-eyed man be considered black? In this day and age, when even Barack Obama is thought by some to be not black enough, thinking that King is anything but white seems absurd.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was one of the most interesting things for me as I worked on this book,&#8221; Sandweiss says. &#8220;His Pullman porter&rsquo;s coat was probably a warrant for his black identity,&#8221; she points out, adding that Pullman only hired black men as porters.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I also think the whiteness of his skin was the best proof that he was black. I mean, why would anybody who looked like that claim to be a black man unless he really was? It carried no social or political privileges with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, to be defined as a Negro, you only needed to have one black great-grandparent, so you could, in fact, be very light-skinned and be classified as black. This is obviously what Ada must have thought, but by the time she died  &mdash;  in 1964 at the astonishing age of 103  &mdash;  Sandweiss believes she knew all of her husband&rsquo;s secrets. &#8220;If she hadn&rsquo;t already figured it all out, she surely would have during the trial in 1933.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this story reminds readers of The Human Stain, Philip Roth&rsquo;s novel about a half-black, half-white man passing as white and Jewish, you&rsquo;re not alone. Sandweiss thought of it frequently during the four-and-a-half years she spent writing Passing Strange, especially with the number of times she had to fill in historical blanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was absolutely an inspiration for this book. I admire that book so much, how Roth gets inside of his character&rsquo;s heads and imagines their motivations. Certainly many times working on this book I wished I was a novelist so I could narrate with a kind of a magnificent omniscience what&rsquo;s really going on here.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&rsquo;m not a novelist, and I&rsquo;m certainly not a brilliant novelist like Philip Roth. I&rsquo;m a historian who lives and dies by her footnotes. This is a history book.&#8221;</p>
<p>And a fascinating one at that.<br>

<p>It sounds like Mr. King had a fetish for &#8216;primeval women&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t believe looking for justification for your private unnatural lust is a sound argument for white genocide.</p>

		<p>I am skeptical about King&rsquo;s double life.  I will make it a point to read the book and review some of the references.  In the meantime, the following quote from the author&rsquo;s web page indicates that she may have an evolving view of &#8220;rules of evidence&#8221;.</p>
<p>My reason for skepticism is the current fad for &#8220;discovering&#8221; that famous White historical figures were Black.  Such claims have been made for Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, etc with vaporous evidence, yet the claims are treated as Gospel by many in academia.  In the cases of the Bard and da Vinci  at least, the recent discovery of historical portraits has provided further testimony to support their obvious Whiteness.  </p>

		<p>This is not news.  The Clarence King/James Todd connection is written about in &#8220;The Five of Hearts: An Intimate Portrait of Henry Adams and His Friends&#8221;, by Patricia O&rsquo;Toole, published in 1990.  No wonder ten minutes research was enough to discover the fact.  So, the guy was a weirdo who enjoyed some serious slumming.  Since he told his wife that he was a railroad porter and she believed it, we can assume that their conversations were not as elevated as those he had with his intellectual friends.  A fit topic for psychologists maybe, but not for a historian.  </p>

		<p>The sad fact is that many White men, especially from the upper classes, have always had sexual liasions with Black women. From Thomas Jefferson to Strom Thurmond.</p>
<p>The late Alex Haley&rsquo;s book The Autobiography of Malcom X has several chapters about how well heeled White men would come down to Harlem to engage in hedonisitic, wanton behavior with Black women.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why would anybody who looked like that (fair skin, blond hair, blue eyes) claim to be a black man  unless he really was?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this an educated person speaking?</p>
<p>Why did George Adamski claim to meet people from Venus unless he really did?</p>
<p>Why did those people kill themselves to ride on a comet out of here unless they were really going to?</p>
<p>I assume Sandwiess is employing the &#8220;criterion of dissimilarity&#8221; which states that, to determine historical truth, a statement that is NOT to a person&rsquo;s benefit has more probability of being true. She has already decided that telling people he was black, and making them think so (by putting on a pullman&rsquo;s coat!!!!) was not to his benefit.</p>
<p>I think she is very naive about human nature.</p>

		<p>Its very understandable why black women would want to marry white men. They have a lot more  to offer in terms of stability and security than their men. These women know their children will be well provided and cared for. Many white women take this for granted and don&rsquo;t appreciate these things. They claim men work too many hours in the divorce case, when in reality hes just trying to provide a decent life for his family. Black women may not be as physically attractive as white women, but they are very gratefully and will bend over backwards and jump through loops to try to keep you satisfied. Attractiveness isn&rsquo;t just physical beauty.</p>
<p> I hear black women complain all the time that black men don&rsquo;t want marriage, they just want babies. Many of the white men who marry black women usually  pick women who are above average. They are college educated, conservative, childless, career and family oriented. These are the very few women who defeat the stereotype.</p>

They went on and on about how they found some Black women exotic, vibrant sensual etc&hellip; A few of them are apparently are dating Black women and the like.It was sickening.</p>
<p>So yes, this sort of miscegenation is happening and perhaps it has been taking place for awhile.   </p>

<p>The number of White men who responded expressing similar sentiments (one oeven told him to get in line and wait his turn) was disgusting. We are through as a nation.</p>

<p>One prson who referred to himself as Wally Cleaver talked about how he could pull up in his mercedes or BMW, flash a large amount of money and get a Black woman instantly. Then talked about how he would have sex withe them break off the relationship once he got tired of them. </p>
<p>I also remember another guy who admitted that when he was in his late 20sto mid 30s how he has an ample amount sex with Black women, including some married ones and how he &#8220;regretted&#8221; that he broke up one couple&rsquo;s marriage! The jerk!</p>

		<p>Alot of younger white males and black women are having relationships and marrying.  Currently, these relationships have a higher rate of divorce.  Eventually these people wake up in their 40s and realize they married someone for the wrong reasons.  Also of the black women I&rsquo;ve known, many black women are attracted more to black men than white men but because black males aren&rsquo;t the marrying kind, they will &#8220;settle&#8221; for a white male.  </p>

<p>The fact is that the divorce rate is over 50% in our nation among many races. Black, White, Hispanic. Asians are an exception.etc&hellip; Most people marry more than once. Race is irrelevant.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Several years ago here in Indiana, we had a sex scandal involving White men and Black women. some of these men were married&hellip;.Before this scandal, I would have not believed such a thing, but now I am not surprised</p>
<p>Where did you believe all the mulattos among American Blacks, at all times in American history, emerged from?</p>
<p>Miscegenation practised by White men with Black women since slavery, which has produced many mulattos over the centuries, is responsible for most of the problems we have today. It is mulattos such as Julian Bond, Andrew Young, Malcom X, Elijah Muhammad, WEB Dubois, Farrakhan, and Jeremiah Wright, who are (or were) the most anti-White Black leaders in America.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to feel sorry for Jeremiah Wright, who attacked America in his sermons. The pictures of him that I have seen, show him to be a Black who is lighter-skinned than many Southern Europeans. But the race that created him, does not consider him to be part of its community.</p>
<p>The danger of the mulattos is that they possess some of the high IQs of whites, but combine it with the aggressive nature of blacks. They (along with part-white mestizos) represent the greatest danger to the survival of the White race. The old Southern Segregationists warned that miscegenation will destroy America. Their warning is coming true.<br>

<p>It seems to me that these White men must be willing to &#8220;settle&#8221; for Black females as well.</p>
<p>No interracial relationship is one sided.</p>

<p>If you google &#8220;divorce interracial couples&#8221; you&rsquo;ll see Steve Sailer&rsquo;s report where he references a report on the CDC gov website.  The rate is slightly higher than same race couples.  The stats are from a 1995 report.</p>

<p>Steve Sailer has also made it clear that he is not totally against interracial marriage either.</p>
<p>He is not someone we should trust on this issue.</p>

		<p>Reading some of the comments certainly re-inforces that old adage of &#8220;the educated fool&#8221;. Men and women since of the beginning of time,have crossed racial, ethnic, religious lines for love, lust or whatever. I believe they will continue to do so. And as for who is considered beautiful or desirable, it truly is in the eye of the beholder. I assure you many blacks (I among them) are just as admiring of their own as some you seem to be, but I am still able (Thank God) to see beauty in other peoples, though I have no desire to cross color lines especially. </p>
