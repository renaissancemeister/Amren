			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Renewal Party (Partido Nacional Renovador), February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: The following story has been translated from the Portuguese by Google&rsquo;s translation software.]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>The recent news of the &#8220;Morning Post&#8221; and &#8220;Daily News&#8221;, which are based on sources and statements of the Judicial Police in Lisbon and Porto, they reason that the NRP has always said that &#8220;the growing crime is directly related with immigration. &#8220;</p>
<p>According to the study shown by CM, based on the PJ in Lisbon, 41% of murderers are foreigners, and that, according to the same source as a percentage of 7% of the population, so easily there is strong propensity to the crime within the immigrants, who leads the NRP to say that immigration has increased crime. Thus, the assertion that 59% percent of murderers are Portuguese is a fallacy, since the one hand are direct result of immigration and on the other hand, for the NRP, they are not and never will in fact Portuguese.</p>
<p>Also, according to DN, the deputy national director of the Judicial Police of the Port, Romão Batista, says that violent crime is increasing and diversifying it. Such statements, again, give reason to the PNR, and indeed not new to people in general, but for the MAI which systematically devalues this scourge.</p>
<p>José Pinto-Coelho, has never hesitated to say &#8220;that the Portuguese people is to be the victim in his own house, crime brought by immigration that we invade and breach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, for the NRP, is urgent:</p>
<p>&gt; Amend the Nationality Law, to establish &#8220;Jus Sanguino&#8221; (citizenship through bloodlines); </p>
<p>&gt; Reverse migration, the form of illegal, and marginal benefit-dependent;</p>
<p>&gt; Support the police, giving them authority, means to act, equipment and preparation, dignifying his career at risk and attrition;</p>
<p>&gt; Prosecute the crimes with speed;</p>
<p>&gt; Ensure the effective enforcement of penalties.</p>
<p>For the NRP, immigration, is not beneficial, according to the official propaganda that says, as also is very damaging to Portugal.</p>

			<p>Who exactly are the immigrants that Portugal is having problems with? Muslims like so much of Europe?</p>

			<p>Portugal gets its immigrants from the south side of the Mediterranean, just as the rest of southern Europe does; they also get immigrants from their former colonies. </p>

			<p>Notice that they used the &#8220;black sheep&#8221; concept from the SVP in Switzerland, and the flame in their logo is like the Front National (France) logo.  They&rsquo;re good ideas, might as well use them.</p>

<p>Muslims and blacks of course and worse, BLACK MUSLIMS looking for the handouts. I think Italy is finally tired of all of the muslims coming into their country and is now becoming unPC in their dealings with the muslims.</p>

			<p>Yes Portugal is in close proximity to African countries and unfortunately like all members of the EU it has to abide by EU immigration rules which as well as being lax are full of loopholes which can be exploited by unscrupulous &#8216;refugees&rsquo; using the European Human Rights Act. Portugal has had various Socialist governments since the 70s one of them being led by &#8216;ex-Marxist&rsquo; Manuel Barosso, who is the current EU Commissioner President. Nationalist parties are on the rise in almost every European nation in opposition to the multicultural-obsessed EU which is controlled by these neo-Marxists who see mass immigration as a tool to flood the EU nation-states with immigrants and make their multicultural society an irreversible fact of life.</p>
