			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, March 24, 2009 [Scroll down the page.]</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three polls released last week by Rasmussen Reports reaffirm what true immigration reformers have known for years: the American public overwhelmingly supports enhanced border security and strengthened interior enforcement of our immigration laws. The results of these polls further undermine the arguments of amnesty advocates who claim that the American people want &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; immigration reform.</p>
<p>The first Rasmussen poll, released March 16th, focused on border security. According to the poll, 79% of voters support using troops on the U.S.-Mexico border to protect Americans from drug-related violence. The 79% figure marked a 21% jump in support for the use of the U.S. military along the border in just two months. Only 10% of U.S. voters oppose putting U.S. troops on the border to fight drug violence, while 11% say they are unsure. Strong support for placing U.S. troops on the border may stem from the fact that 82% of U.S. voters are concerned that Mexican drug violence will spill over into the United States, including 50% who say that they are very concerned. The poll also found that more than six in ten Americans say that the Department of Homeland Security should continue to build a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border. (Rasmussen Reports, March 16, 2009). The release of the poll came just days after President Obama and other members of his administration expressed reluctance to deploy members of the National Guard to the border. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Update, March 16, 2009).</p>
<p>The second Rasmussen poll, released March 17, highlighted strong support for local law enforcement of immigration laws. According to the poll, 73% of voters say that police officers should automatically check to see if someone is in the country legally when the officer pulls that person over for a traffic violation, while only 21% disagree. Furthermore, 67% of voters say that if law enforcement officers know of places where immigrants gather to find work, they should conduct surprise raids to identify and deport illegal aliens. (Rasmussen Reports, March 17, 2009). The poll&rsquo;s findings came less than two weeks after House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) questioned the success of the 287(g) program  &mdash;  which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enter into agreements to train state and local law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Update, March 9, 2009).</p>
<p>A third Rasmussen poll, released March 18, shows that nearly seven in ten voters support strict government sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens. Only 22% say that employers should not be punished, while another 10% are not sure. Nearly half of U.S. voters support sanctions for landlords who rent or sell property to illegal aliens, while 36% are opposed to such penalties. (Rasmussen Reports, March 18, 2009). These findings came just eight days after the Senate voted to kill an amendment offered by Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to the $410 billion Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 1105) that would have reauthorized the E-Verify program  &mdash;  which prevents employers from hiring illegal aliens in the first place  &mdash;  through September 2014. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Action Alert, March 10, 2009).<br>

			<p>I am acquainted with someone who works for walmart.  Her co-worker called last week and told her not to be there on Wednesday because there was going to be a latino &#8220;gang initiation&#8221;.  Another woman in the class I am taking knows some people in law enforcement and the &#8220;rumor&#8221; there is that they found a headless body behind walmart Thursday morning.  Nothing in the papers or news, so we are figuring that they covered it up.  </p>

			<p>You got that right, SKIP.</p>
<p>BTW, I am against the idea of military service for citizenship. You know why?</p>
<p>If this country should ever go into martial law, American soldiers would be reluctant to fire on their fellow citizens  &mdash;  foreigners wouldn&rsquo;t have such qualms, they&rsquo;d fire away.</p>
<p>Something to think about.</p>
<p>Illegals here?  Deport them all.</p>

			<p>The immigration issue is so broad it covers the entire USA landscape!  It involves billions (both in Gov funding to illegals,as well as, the underground drug &amp; human smuggling business.  It involves National Security and large groups from all over the world waiting to enter. Narco Mexico and international interests are destroying USA economy.  The immigration issue is always buried by both parties because the failure of many administrations to effective enforce USA immigration laws. Special interests of immigrant children now run businesses to bring more and more of their groups into US. This is a problem due to total neglect of taxpayers who pay for protection and safety. Charges need to be brought against those who have betrayed US for foreign interests. Instead I think there is money laundry used in elections to keep this travesty going until the country is lost to the imported immigrants.  Native borns have been forced to pay for a government working against US!!     V</p>

			<p>With the funds being sent to Mexico by the US, we are literally pouring taxpayers dollars right into the drug cartels. For some reason, this and former administrations are absolutely blind when it comes to the terrorist nation to our south. They are no better than any country that harbors those who murder, kidnap, behead, etc. When will our leaders finally say &#8220;enough?&#8221; We have pandered to that vile and corrupt country for decades. When Obama waved the magic wand of citizenship for their criminals, there will never be another person who will be so foolish as to wait their turn and follow the rules. We&rsquo;ve been lied to time and again about whatever anmensty it was being the &#8220;last&#8221; one. Do we really think this country can sustain the millions here who will then be allowed to bring their very large families? Goodbye, America, and to my dear grandchildren&hellip;I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>

			<p>You know what Shakespeare said about the lawyers and the money changers.</p>
<p>Until there is a party to represent grass roots americans there is no hope.</p>
<p>The democrats and republican parties are little more than a communist manifesto.</p>

			<p>All our politicians have long known the public&rsquo;s angry feelings on illegal immigration, it has just been a matter for most of them to pretend concern while letting the Latino lobbies know they won&rsquo;t vote for anything to really stop it. They are sell-outs, pure &amp; simple. </p>
<p>When the last &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform bill&#8221; (i.e., amnesty bill) was defeated due to public outrage politicians like McCain would disingenuously say &#8220;Oh I get it now, you want border control first&#8221;. They always &#8220;get it&#8221;, they just want the Latino vote to insure re-election, and screw the rest.</p>

			<p>The record of polls is no small matter.  If we ever get into a position to do something about our situation, the record will constitute hard evidence that the status quo is illegitimate, and that there must be a return to the status quo ante for a state or government to be considered legitimate.</p>
<p>In other words, what they&rsquo;ve been doing to us since at least 1965 is illegal and unjust, and the situation will not be considered &#8220;fixed&#8221; until it is UN-done.  The aforementioned record is evidence of this.</p>

<p>True, as i have said before, I was brought from Viet-Nam to D.C. during the black riots of &#8216;68 and put in the Pentagon and told (with my squad) to open fire if the blacks crossed a given line, NOT if we were fired on first, only if a line was crossed. Not sure I (we) could have done that THEN! NOW is different! But the point is that soldiers with allegience to other than the U.S. would be unprerdictable. BTW when we were brought to D.C. in &#8216;68 only Special Forces, Rangers, LRRPs and other elite units were brought NOT the general Army.</p>

			<p>I am glad, in a perverse fashion, that all the hellish things that Mexico shipped over her with their illegals, now they are getting a taste of their own medicine as that country is going the way of the dodo.   We will eventually have to invade that oil-rich country and this will cause Mr. Obama many headaches as the liberal dream of a multicultural society is falling in front of our eyes.  I love to see the Mexican government get what they finally deserve after they nearly destroyed our country, those bums and war criminals.  They will be hanged by the idiotic drug lords down there who will just continue fighting until Uncle Sam moves in and he will have to, otherwise, Obama will not be able to pass a single legislative accomplishment.</p>

			<p>What WE, law abiding, tax paying citizens tell our REPRESENTATIVES we want is ignored as they do what THEY please. The word REPRESENTATIVE here is very important, THEY work for US we are NOT their subjects, or people to be ruled. Andonce we get that figured out again WE will take control of what is really ours (America)</p>
