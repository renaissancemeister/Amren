			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Borg, Providence Journal, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The principal of Roger Williams Middle School says he was punched and bitten by a parent in his office Friday afternoon after he told her that her son was being suspended from school.</p>
<p>Aleyda Uceta, 30, of 164 Gallatin St., was charged with assault on school officials, assault on police officers and resisting arrest.</p>
<p>The principal, Rudolph Moseley Jr., said he told Uceta that her 11-year-old son would be suspended for three days, according to a police report. Moseley told the police that she became angry and began yelling at him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moseley repeatedly asked Uceta to lower her voice but she refused, the police said, and Uceta then punched the principal in the face. When Moseley pushed the mother away, her son struck him, according to the police report. Next, Uceta allegedly grabbed Moseley&rsquo;s left arm and began biting him.</p>
<p>A teacher intervened and began speaking to Uceta in Spanish but Uceta punched her in the face, according to the police.</p>
<p>When officers arrived, they attempted to escort Uceta out of the school but she continued to try to punch Moseley, the police said.</p>
<p>By then, a large crowd of Uceta&rsquo;s family had gathered, making it difficult for the officers to take her into custody. During the struggle, Uceta bit a patrolman&rsquo;s arm and struck a patrolman in the face, according to the police. She also kicked another police officer and ripped the pocket out of his jacket.</p>
<p>After Uceta was placed in custody she said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to take your gun and shoot all of you,&#8221; according to the police report.</p>
<p>While handcuffed and seated on the floor of the school&rsquo;s main office, Uceta attemped to kick the window panes out of a door, the police said.</p>
<p>Moseley was taken to a hospital for treatment, according to the police. One officer was bitten and another suffered a back injury, the police said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Moseley said he was fine and that he had no idea what prompted the attack. The 11-year-old boy was suspended from school, he said, because he refused to go to a room where misbehaving students are assigned to cool down. The incident happened around 1 p.m.</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;well, in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; the problem here seems to stem from the principal&rsquo;s racist expectations that Ms. Uceta would &#8220;assimilate&#8221; her unique cultural views to the racist &#8220;Anglo&#8221; paradigm, whence parents actually <i>punish</i> their children! (Heaven help us!)</p>
<p>Slap him with a hate crime and throw away the key.</p>

			<p>The reason she got all riled up is that now she&rsquo;ll have to spend three days at home with what she spawned. Is she an illegal alien ? Does she have a husband(s) ? Is she on some type of welfare ? This is another reason to get your children out of public schools. Anyhow, the judge will probably let her off because the principal did not show enough compassion and understanding to her and her brat. The Earth is the insane asylum for the rest of the universe.</p>

<p>Obviously, either the aggressive student or his aggressive mother placed a cell phone call to relative.  In the US, as I understand, it is illegal to block cell phone calls.  The rationale being that one might need to send or receive an emergency call.  In the story at hand, however, the absence of signal blocking was actually created a hazard.</p>

			<p>I send my regards to Roger Williams and hope that he has truly relished his moment of up front diversity. As a principal, i am sure diversity was one of the greatest things in his mind.</p>
<p>I can only hope this fine &#8220;enrichment&#8221; across his face, has served to bring that probable belief of his down to reality. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Yesterday, Moseley said he was fine and that he had no idea what prompted the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>No idea what prompted the attack? He should know, since no doubt this public schools mission policy includes a lot of gibberish about promoting multi-culturalism. But obviously, this principle has no clue about other cultures, because this type of behavior is typical, expected, and even admired in Latino &#8216;culture&rsquo;. You want multi-culturalism, you got it. </p>

			<p>With a mother like that, why should anyone be surprised this kid got suspended for something?  Apparently he&rsquo;s been picking up a few pointers on behavior from his mom.</p>

I hope everyone in the community sees what diversity brings.</p>
<p>Race realism comes from experience, not ignorance.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure this woman will get the best attorney the ACLU has to offer.  She&rsquo;ll get off scot-free, with a seven-figure police brutality/discrimination settlement to boot.</p>

			<p>You left out the most interesting part of the story:</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger Williams is the school where an assistant principal, Robert Perkins, was suspended last week after he stepped on a Dominican flag on Dominican Independence Day. The students had reportedly been running up and down the hallways with the flag. The incident caused an uproar in the Dominican community, which felt that their flag had been dishonored.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I have to agree with &#8220;Anonymous at 9:32PM on March 20.  There is this Hispanic family that lives next door to me.  They think they own the whole neighborhood.  The husband is the attack dog with the wife egging him on.  If they feel slighted, their mode of communication is aggressive behavior with verbal threats suggestive of possible physical assault.  They have poisoned the neighborhood turning neighbor against neighbor with their devious, manipulative, and vindictive behavior.  In my experience, the worst ones are not the ones doing blue collar work but the ones who moved up the economic ladder using &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; to their advantage.  They are the devious and greedy.  </p>

			<p>Go to the original article and read the feedback comments.  This pricipal got what he deserved!   If the comments are a good representation of what the Providence community is thinking, they are sick and tired of the illegals and the liberal agenda.<br>
Tea Party anyone?</p>

			<p>This is not something new. Here in my city, back in the 90&rsquo;s, a local black activist walked into the school administration building one day, and spit on the school superindendant. (Which i thought constituets a felony assault charge.) Supposedly, this activist was upset because his teenage daughter was suspended from school, stemming from her radical and diliquent behavior. </p>
<p>The superindenadant, who was Italian, never pressed charges. </p>

			<p>Mosley said &#8220;he was fine&#8221;. Obviously,liberal Mosley deserves the abuse. The liberal judge will admonish the police for lack of sensitivity and the mother will get compensation for the embarrassment she suffered. </p>

			<p>Will we be able to follow up this story? Other posters are correct in that this is indeed common conduct with these lowlifes. The difference being only that hispanics do not do so much finger wagging and head bobbing as blacks, the liklihood of a lawsuit does indeed loom large! </p>

 I live in Providence and grew up in South Providence where this school is located. While I did not, several of my brothers attended this middle school decades ago and it was a zoo then and little has changed. The unions and administrators do their best to hide the distressing condition of most schools in minority areas. Several days after the flag incident, the superintendant of schools took reporters on a tour of Roger Williams where the hallways were quiet and the students attentive in classes and behaving. This was a complete Potemkin Village scenario. It was perfect theatre.<br>
 All this is common, not only in Providence but also in Fall River MA. I know this due to the fact I have siblings teaching in these areas.</p>

<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re Dominicans, as apparently they are, there isn&rsquo;t too much difference from blacks. They just speak a different language.<br>

			<p>Many Dominicans are illegals.  They travel to Puerto Rico and then sneak into the US posing as Puerto Ricans since they look no different than Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>Notice that Rhode Island is a &#8220;blue&#8221; state.  What do you expect from a state that has been promoting liberals for years.  </p>
