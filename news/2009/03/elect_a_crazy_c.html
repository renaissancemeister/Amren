<h1>Elect a Crazy Council, Get Crazy Results</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nolan Finley, Detroit News, March 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nowhere is Michigan&rsquo;s brain drain on greater display than in the Detroit City Council chambers.</p>
<p>My hopes for Detroit&rsquo;s future faded as I watched the tape of last Tuesday&rsquo;s council meeting, the one that considered the Cobo Center expansion deal.</p>
<p>It was a tragic circus, a festival of ignorance that confirmed the No. 1 obstacle to Detroit&rsquo;s progress is the bargain basement leaders that city voters elect. The black nationalism that is now the dominant ideology of the council was on proud display, both at the table and in the audience.</p>
<p>Speakers advocating for the deal were taunted by the crowd and cut short by Council President Monica Conyers, who presided over the hearing like an angry bulldog; whites were advised by the citizens to, &#8220;Go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opponents were allowed to rant and ramble on uninterrupted about &#8220;those people&#8221; who want to steal Detroit&rsquo;s assets and profit from the city&rsquo;s labors.</p>
<p>A pitiful Teamster official who practically crawled to the table on his knees expressing profuse respect for this disrespectful body was battered by both the crowd and the council.</p>
<p>When he dared suggest that an improved Cobo Center would create more good-paying jobs for union workers, Conyers reminded him, &#8220;Those workers look like you; they don&rsquo;t look like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Desperate, he invoked President Barack Obama&rsquo;s message of unity and was angrily warned, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you say his name here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in Detroit, dealing with the council&rsquo;s bigotry is part of the cost of doing business. As is dealing with its incompetence. (I&rsquo;ll pause here and excuse from that indictment Sheila Cockrel and Brenda Jones, who supported the Cobo deal, as did Kwame Kenyatta, who although he&rsquo;s an avowed nationalist, most often votes in the city&rsquo;s best interests.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nobody can help Detroit if voters again elect a City Council composed of separatists, clueless dowagers and the apparently insane.<br>

			<p>Here in North Florida, we are about to elect a mostly black city council despite the fact that this is a mostly white town. One of the blacks is my neighbor. I overheard him tell another black man who he had working on his yard that he was going to work to get more african American business in town. He told him he was only going to hire african Americans. His only opposition is another black lady whose only resume remark I remember is that she is a member of the naacp. You should have read her resume. It could have been better written by a 5th grade student.</p>
<p>It seems there are few white people who care anymore. The union guy mentioned above should never have groveled. I will never lower myself to this standard. I will simply move off into the country into a trailer if I have to.</p>
<p>I fear it is much too late to awaken our country. The people just will not accept the fact that black rule has never worked anywhere. </p>
<p>I still ask anyone, ANYONE, tell me a city, state, or country under black rule that is prosperous. I encourage anyone living in the south to tour Selma Alabama and see the degradation that has been wrought upon that small town.</p>

			<p>Blatant racism by blacks is like a badge of honor to them.  Anything less would be &#8220;actin white&#8221;.  </p>
<p>In my state, the DMV is the worst example of a black run bureacracy.  Thank goodness I can now renew my drivers license online and avoid their snotty, racist attitudes.</p>

<p>Anyone who has had the opportunity to watch and listen to blacks rant and rave knows what this is all about. It would be comic if the consequences weren&rsquo;t tragic.</p>
<p><i>Conyers reminded him, &ldquo;Those workers look like you; they don&rsquo;t look like me.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet there was hollerin&rsquo; over that one.</p>
<p>Conyers has a city and a council that looks like her. That&rsquo;s all that matters to her and her kind.</p>

<p>Haiti, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Detroit. What&rsquo;s the common thread? What&rsquo;s the common outcome?</p>

<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s now infected the federal government with its pro-black white self-haters and black community organizer still working only for black causes.</p>
<p>The ongoing process is very simple to explain and understand:  It&rsquo;s called self-destruction by black incompetents who are not smart enough to pass high school, let alone run a country and its cities and states.</p>
<p>We are in the process of sinking, and we are living through one of the most significant events in history and watching it unfold in living color.</p>

			<p>Sounds like Zimbabwe.  This (along with Zimbabwe and South Afrida) should be a warning to anyone who thinks handing over power to blacks is a good idea.  Black nationalists are more vicious, hateful and blatently self-serving than any so-called &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; could ever be.</p>

			<p>Even though I have never had the misfortune of going to Detroit, I have seen pictures.  It looks like Europe after WWII.  It really is a good symbol for America in 2009.  A manufacturing powerhouse built by the likes of Henry Ford and others, now lay in absolute ruins.  It has become an african fiefdom ruled by threat, intimidation and violence.   </p>

			<p>A search on youtube for Monica Conyers gives a large number of videos demonstrating her angry,demented behaviour. She has no place being in city government and if she were white she would have been removed from office immediately.   She is not just racist,unpleasant and obstructionst, she appears to be insane. </p>

			<p>Black arrogance at its best&hellip;</p>
<p>As a white person, I have contributed many thousands of dollars through taxes to feed, educate, and house blacks; I have no problem with having shared my good fortune with blacks. I also believe that ungrateful,immoral, violent, arrogant, corrupt, incompetent blacks have their punishment built-in, so when the white man is no longer around, blacks always end up facing each other in the worst conditions imaginable, thanks only to themselves. </p>
<p>There is a God, people, and he watches our behaviour.</p>

<p>Ah, but Comrade Finley of the even more debased and corrupt &#8220;Detroit News,&#8221; what about a country that is run the same &#8220;crazy&#8221; way?</p>
<p>Did not your paper advocate for an end to Apartheid in South Africa, and the assumption of power there by the Marxist ANC?</p>
<p>You cannot have it both ways, even if the &#8220;Detroit Free Press,&#8221; makes you people look sane; or it did, until your two bankrupted entities merged in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>The white politicians in Michigan are even more stupid.  Despite the state&rsquo;s high unemployement rate and the huge loss of manufacturing jobs, they want to import more Asians, Mexicans, and Middle-Easterners  &mdash;  more people who don&rsquo;t look like them! <br>

<p>Detroit has already been plundered.  The city was once a large, thriving, and vibrant metropolitan area.  Now it is losing millions each year and is dependent on the state of Michigan and the federal government to keep it running.  And they will now look to Obama to send billions of taxpayer money to Detroit.</p>

			<p>This wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;black nationalism&#8221; on display, it was black supremacy on display. Black supremacists want power, but they are incapable of wielding that power with any kind common sense and betterment for anyone but the black power elite. It&rsquo;s also wielded to punish and belittle any whites who are foolish enough to think they can deal with these idiots.</p>

			<p>The point of critical mass is closing in on us.  It&rsquo;s going to be, &#8220;fight or die&#8221; soon.  The more Blacks run things the more incompetence there is and the quicker our cities are going to implode, and with them our country.  Implosion will occur with a depression, and guess who&rsquo;s gonna be lootin&rsquo; and shootin&rsquo; and blaming the blue-eyed devils?  You guessed it - Black folks.  The same Black folks who would be starvin&rsquo; in Africa right now if they were there.  The same Blacks who were freed by &#8220;noble&#8221; White people.  The same Blacks who take our jobs, chase us out of our neighborhoods, get social services with our tax money, steal and rape our women, mug us, kill us and who otherwise have waged an all-out war against us since the 1960&rsquo;s.  The irony; the irony.</p>

			<p>if it&rsquo;s such a problem, start working to get whites elected next time. as a PROUD WHITE business owner, I would NEVER, EVER hire a black. NEVER. no matter how white they act, no way. I suggest everyone else do the same. you live next to a black and kiss their a$$, that&rsquo;s your problem, grow a pair. - or move. I would.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t accuse this man of guilt by association with his predecessors.  We can&rsquo;t afford to alienate people if they or their organizations have just recently come to understand the realities of race in this country.  </p>
<p>Think of the parable of the prodigal son.  Every individual and organization who &#8220;converts&#8221; to our way of thinking should be welcomed and celebrated, so that others will be encouraged rather than afraid to do the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to heed the advice we give to blacks about American slavery.  Stop harboring grudges for old transgressions and focus on the present and future.</p>

			<p>A few weeks ago, the motoring correspondent of a respected UK newspaper reported on the North American International Motor Show. He said &#8216;The exhibition&rsquo;s deeply traumatised home town of Detroit is famously crime-ridden. And at this time of year, when it opens it&rsquo;s icy doors to the world, it&rsquo;s as bleak and hostile as any &#8220;developed&#8221; western city. This is a truly grim, miserable, murderous, sub-zero dump of a place. Industrial, social and political problems are so prevalent that even Motown&rsquo;s high profile mayor was recently jailed. Two &#8216;warming centers&rsquo; had to be opened in recreational halls on Wednesday to keep residents protected from the bone-chilling, potentially lethal cold. It&rsquo;s a bit like New Orleans on ice&rsquo;. However, all is not lost. The UK agent for the &#8216;hummer&rsquo; reported that he sold one in January. I pity the owner as the tank holds 32 US gallons and according to the price of fuel in UK and the current exchange rate, that&rsquo;s about US$155. I bet not many in USA could afford that. It&rsquo;s cheaper to fly across the Atlantic&hellip;return!</p>

<p>The difference is Europe rebuilt. Does anyone think that is going to happen in Detroit?</p>

<p>Thats a bad analogy. Just like how every ethnic group in the world has been a slave. Every ethnic group goes through a violetnt, corrupt, and lazy period of time. Europe and Asian were violent once. So were the Native Americans, but that is no indication of the overall race. Thats like no black has any idea on how to raise and run a country. </p>
<p>Secondly, Detriot is cesspol of rape, murder, corruption, bigotry, and stupidity. This council is a prime example of such. Detroit is crumbling and if it wasnt for welfare it would be like HAITI. Dumb old Detriot will be practically a ghost town in some of our life times.</p>

			<p>No matter what happens whites will be blamed.  Its a political tactic that works because white liberals will not question blacks in any way.  Its like they worship them or something.  </p>
<p>We need to find a way to convert white liberals.  A start would be referring them to websites like this one.</p>
