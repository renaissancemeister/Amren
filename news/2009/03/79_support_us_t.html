				79% Support U.S. Troops on the Border to Fight Drug Violence
			</h1>
			<p style="font-size: smaller">
				<i>Rasmussen Reports, March 16, 2009</i>
			</p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
			<p>
				Seventy-nine percent (79%) of U.S. voters now say the military should be used along the border with Mexico to protect American citizens if drug-related violence continues to grow in that area.
			</p>
			<p>
				This marks a 21-point jump in support for the use of the U.S. military along the border in just two months.
			</p>
			<p>
				Only 10% now say the military should not be used in that fashion, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Eleven percent (11%) are not sure.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				President Obama has expressed concern about the rise of drug violence in Mexico and is reportedly considering sending the National Guard to the border if the high level of violence moves into this country.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eighty-two percent (82%) of voters are concerned that Mexican drug violence will spill over into the United States, including 50% who are very concerned. Just three percent (3%) are not at all concerned. There has been a sizable jump in this concern also over the past two months.
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of voters (52%) remain more concerned about drug violence than illegal immigration. Forty-one percent (41%) are more concerned about the illegals situation. These numbers are largely unchanged from the survey at the beginning of the year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also unchanged is the level of voter support for continued building of a fence along the Mexican border. Sixty-one percent (61%) say the United States should continue the fence, but 27% disagree.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet the majority of GOP voters (53%) remain more concerned about illegal immigration than growing drug violence. Sixty-three percent (63%) of Democrats, on the other hand, are more concerned about drug-related violence. Unaffiliated voters give the edge to drug violence by a 50% to 44% margin.
			</p>
			<p>
				Republicans also are more enthusiastic supporters of the border fence. Seventy-four percent (74%) of Republicans say the United States should keep building the fence, as do 53% of Democrats and 60% of unaffiliateds.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Even without the higher level of concern about drug-related violence, 74% of voters said in early December that the federal government is not doing enough to secure the country&rsquo;s borders.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Homeland Security has announced that it is using money from the new economic stimulus plan to continue work on the border fence.<br />

				In spite of the Obamanation&rsquo;s comments to the effect that he&rsquo;s considering the National Guard for the border, I seriously doubt he will do it, unless there are actual incursions and open, hostile attacks into this country, and even then he will advertise that he&rsquo;s putting a handful of troops on the border in concert with a plan between his government and the Mexican government as a kind of joint effort.
			</p>
			<p>
				He WILL NOT act on his own in a competent response to the problem for fear of alienating his Hispanic base.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, yes, I believe most mestizos would be o.k. with drug traffickers doing what they want unimpeded by US authorities.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t foresee the gangs making a move on the Mexican government right now, but it could be a very real possibility in about a year.

				But Congresswoman Linda SÃ¡nchez said on FoxTV that the matter is not important enough for troop deployment.

				If you believe these numbers, a substantial proportion of non-Whites want to use the army to block the border. And I think that some of those who claim to want to prevent Mexico&rsquo;s violence from spilling into the country, are just embarrassed to say that they want the Mexicans out too.

				I caught only the last few minutes of this on one of the talk shows today, so I don&rsquo;t know who was speaking or what he said before this nonsense. He said that our troops are not lawyers and therefor not qualified to guard the borders lest they violate the civil rights of illegal crossers. After I cleaned up the vomit from the floor, I was hoping that I could recite a magical spell that would catapult me through the television and into the studio so I could punch this guy right in the nose. We have met the enemy and he is US.

				Over and over, ad infinitum, have Americans begged the Bush and now the Obama Administration to stop illegal immigration. They will not. They will not. Cannot the American citizenry see the implications of a Central Government that refuses to,
			</p>
			<p>
				1) Protect the economy?
			</p>
			<p>
				2) Protect the citizenry?
			</p>
			<p>
				Are Americans oblivious to the meaning of it all?

				Yes, I saw that news about Obama floating a troops on the border proposal, and like you, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to happen. But I saw something on Fox News yesterday, reading between the lines, if they are put on the border, they will only be used to prevent guns and drug money from flowing from north to south, but will not be used to prevent illegal aliens from moving from south to north. In other words, they&rsquo;ll essentially be the Mexican border patrol.

				I have been involved in the fight to stop illegal immigration for 15 years and one thing seems constant. Treason in both parties. The people of America have wanted this insanity stopped for as long as I can remember.<br />
				This is the most important issue facing our country.<br />
				Also the issue we can most impact as a people.<br />
				There are many groups fighting this treason. Amren is one.<br />
				Spread the word.<br />
				Fight or loose your country.<br />

				Maybe this is a manufactured crises to merge our two countries? Could we stop using the term open border! If it were open Americans could invade Mexico under armed guard [coyotes] and have jobs lined up under the table in Mexico and use their medical systems and schools etc&hellip; all for free.
			</p>
			<p>
				No it is a one way sieve favoring Mexico.

				Let those people who don&rsquo;t consider illegal immigration a priority&hellip; HAVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOR NEIGHBORS! They&rsquo;ll wake up fast enough and demand their immediate deporation.

				Americans are killed everyday by illegal immigrant Mexicans, on the border and elsewhere. The federal government will not take a stand on the Mexican border, as this would cut off the import of illegals. Border states may have to step up to the plate and take a stand. I believe the narcos funnel money not only to the Mexican government, but also the United States government. We all know that money, and who has the most, is all the matters in Washington DC.

			</p>
			<p>
				The government is taking a stand. Passing more and more hate-crime laws. By which they means anything said or done to Asians, Hispanics or blacks, or gays and women. For all the gay killers of young boys and girls, at least it&rsquo;s not a hate crime.

				Boy, you got that right. Those people probably don&rsquo;t have any Hispanics around them or they wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking that way.

				truthbetold at 7:41PM on March17, said troops on the border aren&rsquo;t important to California Congresswoman Linda Sanchez.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				Certainly for Mexican-American Congresswoman, Linda Sanchez, the matter of troops on the border to stop illegal immigration from Mexico is not important enough. Since, in my opinion, most Mexicans vote for Mexicans,and for issues that favor their relatives, whether legal or illegal, the continuing invasion of illegal alien Mexicans is a mouth watering prospect for Congresswoman Sanchez, because she knows that &#8220;demography is destiny&#8221; &mdash; her destiny.
