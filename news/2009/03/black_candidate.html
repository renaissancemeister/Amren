<h1>Black Candidate Wants to Solve Crime With &#8216;Noose&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Down here in the Deep South, calls to bring back the hanging noose are coming from an unlikely source: a 62-year-old, black Republican mayoral candidate in Mississippi&rsquo;s largest city.</p>
<p>Long-shot George Lambus acknowledges his inflammatory platform has made some residents of Jackson slam doors in his face. Others walked out of a church where he spoke. Yet he insists his tough stand is welcome in some quarters of a state capital racked by crime, much of it black-on-black.</p>
<p>As the only GOP hopeful among nearly a dozen Democrats and four independents, his chances of winning the June election are slim: the majority-black city of about 180,000 is so heavily Democratic that no Republican has won the mayor&rsquo;s race in modern history. Yet, Lambus hopes to stand out in a crowded field by packing a silver pistol and talking bluntly about crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crime can only be alleviated by a noose and a stout tree limb,&#8221; Lambus wrote in one of several homemade flyers he passes out in Jackson neighborhoods. &#8220;I will provide the noose and when the economy improves, I will get the jobs here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mississippi Republican Party is not supporting Lambus. GOP Chairman Brad White said Lambus&rsquo; message doesn&rsquo;t reflect &#8220;the values that we represent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at recent history, like in South Africa, when apartheid was abolished,&#8221; Lambus said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. &#8220;Blacks went on a crime spree. Other blacks got tired of it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they formed vigilantes and they killed people. It brought the crime down.&#8221;</p>
<p>His pistol nearby as he peered out a window at his decaying Jackson neighborhood, Lambus added: &#8220;When you cut your yard, carry a gun. When you go to church, carry a gun. When you go to school, carry a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lambus also asserts that executions are the only way to control crime, adding &#8220;If we look at the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, it&rsquo;s driven with blood.&#8221;</p>

			<p>And where are the white people to admit that cruel measures vis-a-vis black thugs are only the real way to keep the black community in some semblance of peace and tranquility?  It ought not be some novelty black political candidate, it ought to be all of Mississippi&rsquo;s (and America&rsquo;s) white power structure, in government, business, the fine arts and charities.</p>

<p>Say what you want, but at least he&rsquo;s both:<br>
* Promoting <i>black</i> control of <i>black</i> criminals, and<br>
* Not sinking into the usual:<br>
<i>(White) cops have &#8220;abandoned&#8221; our neighbourhood, and we&rsquo;re being ravaged by criminals! <b>We need (white) cops!</b></i><br>
<i>(White) cops are using racial profiling in our neighbourhood and arresting all the young black males! <b>We don&rsquo;t need racist (white) cops!</b></i> nonsense</p>

			<p>GOP Chairman Brad White said Lambus&rsquo; message doesn&rsquo;t reflect &ldquo;the values that we represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we know what &#8220;they&#8221; represent&hellip; crime and the lack of a correct response to it.  Black or white, Lambus would get my vote in a heartbeat on this issue alone.  Hey guys, he might be the real &#8220;new face&#8221; of the Republican Party we&rsquo;ve been waiting for.  I just may switch back after all.<br>

			<p>Since the GOP wants a black chairman they should hire George Lambus and fire the p.c. weenie Michael Steele.</p>

			<p>Give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>Being 62, I&rsquo;m sure he remembers what life was like before MLK and can compare it to today.</p>
<p>The death penalty is a deterrent&hellip;problem is it&rsquo;s not used enough.  Once it&rsquo;s proven beyond doubt that someone is guilty of murder, don&rsquo;t screw around with it  &mdash;  take &#8216;em out back and get rid of &#8216;em.</p>

			<p>There are some black conservatives I like (Jesse Lee Peterson is pretty good) but advocating that particular form of the death penalty is a non-starter.  Lambus doesn&rsquo;t sound like he&rsquo;s serious about getting elected.</p>

			<p>Jesse Lee Peterson has been on TV numerous times ripping black leaders and talking about how pathological black culture is.  In his book &#8220;SCAM&#8221;, he states that if whites left America, within ten years the country would become a ghetto.</p>

<p>Lambus speaks the only language the &#8220;Black&#8221; man really understands. Its too bad the Republican party has neither any  understanding of &#8220;Black&#8221; culture nor of White culture as well. </p>
