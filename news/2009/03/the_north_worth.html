<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We need a paradigm shift in the West that would pave the way for a genuine Northern Alliance of Russia, Europe, and North America, as all three face similar existential threats in the decades ahead. In an uncertain and ever more brutal world, the Northerners may finally consider banding together, lest they be defeated in detail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The concept is as old as Sun Tzu (&#8220;if enemy forces are united, separate them&#8221;) and was more recently restated by Mao (&#8220;concentrate a superior force to destroy the enemy forces one by one&#8221;). It is highly relevant to the American interest because the civilization upon which this country is founded  &mdash;  usually described as &#8220;Western,&#8221; although &#8220;Northern&#8221; would be more accurate  &mdash;  is in danger of being defeated in detail by its enemies, internal and external.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s demographic self-annihilation is well advanced, from the Atlantic to the Urals and beyond, with Russia and the rest of the Old Continent sharing the same downward trend. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia&rsquo;s population has fallen six percent, from around 150 million to just over 140 million. The combination of a low birthrate, an aging population, and a public-health crisis may result in the country&rsquo;s population collapsing by one third, to around 100 million, by 2050. On current form, there will be a 40-percent drop in the size of the core (ages 14 to 25) group, ensuring a continued decline for the rest of the century. At the same time, the number of self-identified Muslims in Russia has risen by 40 percent in the last 15 years to 20 million, partly fueled by immigration from Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>In Metropolitan France, an ostensibly healthy birthrate of 12.2 per thousand conceals the fact that, of some 800,000 births in a nation of almost 60 million, Muslim immigrants (predominantly from North Africa) and their French-born descendants account for more than a quarter. Italy will plummet from today&rsquo;s 57 million to a much older 40 million by 2050. By that time, the continent as a whole will face a net loss of some 150 million people. Europe&rsquo;s population has aged to such a degree that it will continue to shrink even in the unlikely event that birthrates rebound to the replacement level. This &#8220;negative momentum&#8221; means that even if women in the future should have an unexpected fertility increase to two children on average, the population would be destined to continue shrinking.</p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s, the U.S. birthrate not only dipped below replacement but fell below the European rate. In the years since, the American rate recovered modestly to just below replacement level. The fertility rate of white Americans slipped below the replacement rate in the early 1970&rsquo;s, however, and it never recovered: Today it stands at about 1.8 babies per woman.</p>
<p>Demographers say that the U.S. population will grow by 135 million in the next four decades  &mdash;  a stunning 44-percent increase  &mdash;  but that growth will be entirely the result of immigration (overwhelmingly from the Third World) and increases in the nonwhite population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Continental conservatives  &mdash;  German Christian Democrats; French, Spanish, and Italian rightists  &mdash;  are natural Northerners even when they are squeamish about admitting it. Members of the dominant European left, however, are overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Barack Obama because they are ashamed of their own roots and looks. The sentiment is becoming all-pervasive: Even The Economist opined that Obama&rsquo;s victory &#8220;would salve, if not close, the ugly wound left by America&rsquo;s history.&#8221; The left flatly denies that a common Euro-Russo-American civilization exists, let alone that it is worth preserving or jointly defending.</p>
<p>It is in the United States that the obstacles to a northern paradigm are the most formidable. Opponents are present, to some extent, in every influential segment of this country&rsquo;s foreign-policy community.</p>
<p>American exceptionalists believe that the United States differs qualitatively from Europe (not to mention Russia) by virtue of her &#8220;propositional credo,&#8221; which transcends the shackles of ethnicity, race, culture, and faith. Global hegemonists seek dominance over Europe and fragmentation of Russia, rather than partnership with them. Many hegemonists are also visceral Russophobes, owing to their own ethno-cultural baggage rather than any objective assessment of Moscow&rsquo;s global position and impact on U.S. interests. Obama&rsquo;s selection of Joe Biden as his Vice President, Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s appointment to State, Robert Gates&rsquo; retention at the Pentagon, and General Jones&rsquo;s management of the National Security Council point to the President&rsquo;s willful blindness to the collapsing economic foundation of the American &#8220;hyperpower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiculturalists oppose any notion of &#8220;our&#8221; physical or cultural space that does not belong to everyone. They deny that we should have a special affinity for any particular country, nation, race, or culture, but demand the imposition of our preferences upon the whole world. They are the mortal enemy of any notion that any shared legacy of the European family is worthy of preservation.</p>
<p>These groups share the radical notion that America is not a real country, but a metaphysical concept or a tool for their own Will to Power  &mdash;  or both. They do not want this country to belong to the people whose ancestors created her and who have inhabited her for generations. They celebrate the resulting random mélange of mutually disconnected multitudes as somehow uniquely &#8220;American&#8221; and virtuous.</p>
<p>Ideologues will deny it, but in the decades to come Europe, Russia, and America will be in similar mortal peril from those very multitudes. The magnitude of that threat will become clear as those nations age and the numbers of hostile aliens grow. In the end there will be no grand synthesis, no crossfertilization, and certainly no peaceful coexistence, between the North and the Third World.</p>
<p>The short-term prospects for fostering a sense of unity among Europeans  &mdash;  Eastern, Western, and American  &mdash;  are dim and will remain so for as long as the regimes of all the major states of the West are controlled by an elite class hostile to its own biological roots and cultural fruits.</p>
<p>In the longer term, however, it is at least conceivable that the ongoing financial and economic crisis will produce salutary political and cultural effects. In the face of diminished property values, rising unemployment, and collapsed retirement portfolios, our elites risk a comprehensive loss of credibility and authority comparable to that experienced by Europe&rsquo;s ruling class in 1914-18. When the dust settles they may no longer be heeded as arbiters of who we are, what we are to think, and how we are to lead a good life. As the credibility of American global dominance tanks with the dollar, Europe may increasingly see its interests tracking with those of Russia, forcing Washington to acquiesce.</p>
<p>No refocusing of international policy will matter if there is not a reversal of demographic and immigration trends. The richer the country, the emptier its cradles. A trend toward Third World living standards may lead to Third World birthrates. Increased scarcity may finally break the political taboo about addressing non-European immigration.</p>
<p>Can we hope that a reminder of the harsher realities of life will revive the North&rsquo;s sense of itself as a Christian civilization and resistance to the stealth jihad being waged in our midst? Sadly, the more likely result of the crisis we now face is deepening demoralization, increased demands for government solutions and services, and ever more inane adulation of such purveyors of political snake oil as our newly enthroned President Messiah. In the early eighth century the triumphant march of Islam into Christendom seemed unstoppable, until it was halted at the gates of Constantinople (718) and at Tours (732). Conversely, in July 1914, Europe was at the peak of every imaginable human achievement, only to be turned into a pale shadow of its former self a mere century later.</p>

			<p>Unlike all the other world leaders, Russia&rsquo;s now dictator realizes the white peril.  Ironically, his attempt to use our diversity against us to weaken the United States so he can invade the countries that made up the former Soviet Union will only make us stronger.  What do I mean?  After Putin has milked all he can from Obama and eastern europe is left defenseless, this evil but very smart man will ask for a meeting at the White House.  He will be polite in the private meeting but once the whole media asks Questions with the two leaders side by side Putin will say something like &#8221; I really want to work with your president but I cannot do so until  I see proof that he is constitutionally able to be president. Will you allow the release of your vault birth certificate?&#8221;  Putin will then fly back to Russia and while America falls into a constitutional/ government crisis with racial riots every where because of the whole impeachment that is sure to come, Putin will then have no one to oppose his eastern european invasion.   Thats my take on how America will WAKE UP.  All because of a very smart evil dictator using our diversity against us.</p>

			<p>I never understood why the United States pursued a trade union (NAFTA) including Mexico in the process when the country should have joined forces with the EU and Russia.  The Northern Hemisphere along with Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Uruguay would have controlled 3/4 of the world&rsquo;s economy. There also would have been a shared military treaty similiar to NATO, possibly being called the Western Alliance.  This pipedream can still happen, although I doubt the US will play any role in it since it is probably past the point of no return.  The first logical step towards uniting the West would be Europe breaking away from the US and signing defense treaties with Russia.  </p>

			<p>From the time the USSR collapsed, I have believed that the most important foreign policy goal of the U.S. ought to be good relations with Russia.  We have no quarrel with them, and common threats.  Were both we and the Russians agreed to defend our countries from invasion, Europe would have to follow along.  </p>

I would say that western Europe is toast, as well as the southwestern United States, Florida, Texas, and major metropolitan centres like Vancouver, Toronto, New York, and Chicago. All-white enclaves in the future, should whites get serious about it, might include Russia (at least Siberia east of the Ural Mountains), Alaska, the Yukon and Northwest Territories in Canada, and the Arctic territory of Nunavut. We&rsquo;d have to write off Scandinavia, but Iceland is a good bet for a white haven, as well as Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and possibly the Maritimes and New England (must push the Somalis out of Lewiston, Maine first though).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need to plan to secure some prime agricultural land (Ukraine, Saskatchewan), as well as seaports (Vladivostok, Prince Rupert, etc.), access to raw materials, and ideally some natural geographic barriers that serve to deter third world invasion (e.g., distance, which is why Canada to date has had far fewer illegals from Central America than the United States).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to give up the idea of tropical paradises, California sunshine, and all the other idyllic trappings that whites favor all too much. Back to rigor, bad weather, and making do with what nature provides.</p>
<p>This compilation of what needs to be considered is far from done, of course, but it hopefully does provide a starting point.<br>

			<p>&#8220;There is a new civilization emerging in the Third World that thinks that the white, northern hemisphere has always oppressed it and must therefore fall at its feet now&hellip;If the northern civilization wants to protect itself, it must be united: America, the European Union, and Russia. If they are not together, they will be defeated one by one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a man that knows exactly what is going on.  But will the effeminates in Washington, D.C. ever admit he&rsquo;s right and take whatever action is necessary to keep from being overwhelmed?</p>
<p>Well, the answer to that is evident a hundred times over by reading what they write and say.</p>
<p>According to them, it isn&rsquo;t even in line to suggest non-whites hate us when the evidence is slapping them directly in their faces, so how on earth would they ever agree to protect ourselves from the hatred and overt racism from non-whites?</p>
<p>We need to rid ourselves of the pansies and weasels and act on our own, and that is what will happen as we slowly convert to self-sufficiency once the nation states have went bankrupt and failed.</p>

			<p>Vladimir Putin is not evil.  He is one of the only leaders of a white country who is a nationalist.  Tony Blair and George W. Bush are the evil ones.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that even at a pro-white website like Amren, there are so many people mouthing anti-Russian and anti-European rhetoric.  The neocons promote hostility towards our racial brothers in Russia and Europe because they want white people divided.  Unfortunately, they sometimes get help from unsophisticated American ignoramuses.  Look at who is behind the hostility towards Russian and Europe in the media and you will see it is coming from people who are opposed to whites defending their interests.</p>

<p>Wow!  Talking about hitting the nail right on the head!  This man obviously has the moral clarity to see what the problem with the West is today, and just as importantly, the sfere d&rsquo;ottone to shout it out.  Sadly, almost none of our political and religious leaders can shine his shoes.</p>

This is the &#8220;Big Lie&#8221; of the multicults. These people are actually anti-white and think all whites should be subservient to other cultures who they view as &#8220;superior&#8221; to or more &#8220;noble&#8221; then western/european cultures.</p>

			<p>Finally someone who understands issues and takes the western civilization as a whole/Former Soviet union countries included!/.Where he misses though is that he does not take the rest as a whole.We are focused on the small problem of islam, due to its immediacy, while we have completely lost sight of a much bigger picture. No wonder. The sporadic acts of terror by islamic loonies got us so paralyzed with fear that we do not dare see much bigger chalenges ahead of us.<br>
The nationalistic China will soon have population of 1.5 billion.Foolish to think they will not aggresively pursue their existential struggle for world resources.<br>
The nationalistic Greater India / Pakistan, Indian, Bangladesh/ will soon reach 2.5 billion from current 1.5 billion. Their struggle for survival will be even more feroucious. Democracy is truly irrelevant in this context .<br>
Same story for south east asian countries and africa.<br>
America,Europe and Russia are busy empowering all these countries militarily, probably hoping they will pit them against<br>
one another, not realizing that although those countries may differ in their races, ideologies and religions they stand united in their belief of cultural superiority and grudge against the west. </p>

			<p>The first step is building awareness of the fragile status of Europeans/Whites in the world (getting people to watch the NPI ad on you tube is a good place to start).</p>
<p>MOst whites are still in denial: talk to them, give them the facts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mix it up with &#8220;politics&#8221; (i.e. any other pet issues, like the ones that will alenate progressives), keep it VERY elemental and simple:</p>
<p>we are a small and rapidly shrinking minority, we must secure our own territories and maintain our numbers.</p>
<p>European sentiment is OVERWHELMINGLY anti immigration and Islamization, if this were translated into policy, things would change overnight here. </p>
<p>One key will be disincentives for non whites to maintain their incredible birthrates, i.e. cutting off $$ for any program that encourages it.</p>
<p>It also means we should be pouring billions into birth control in the 3rd world: not exactly a Republican platform position, but these issues transcend left/right, it is about the survival of </p>
<p>a) the only planet we got and </p>
<p>b) Europeans &amp; Europeans civilization. </p>
<p>It would be OK for white population to stabilize or shrink slowly (and good for the planet) IF others were controlling their numbers too, and we could secure our borders.</p>

<p>Hedges is right EXCEPT he glides too quickly over the fact that whites are already in negative population growth.<br>

<p>This is the best piece of amalysis I&rsquo;ve read on Amren in a long time.  Nice to see smart people posting here.  BTW, the neo-cons lionize South Asia as some sort of bulwark against Muslims and China, not realizing that South Asians have their own hegemonic agenda to attend to and an even bigger grudge (against the West) to nurse.<br>

<p>Evil is a relative term. Putin is not a threat to world peace and to the US. The US is a very serious threat to Russia and to many other nations. The US continues to confront China in what is recognized as China&rsquo;s territorial waters&hellip;.as recently as yesterday. Republican war mongerers such as you are bullies and ultimately puppets for an evil cabal the has enriched itself through war.</p>
<p>Keep fighting the cold war. Keep on obeying the Bush family and the Clinton family&hellip;believe the lies they put out about the Serbians and Russians. But keep in mind this:the cold war Bush and Clinton foreign policy is inseparable from post-1965 immigration policy. The intention of post-1965 immigration policy is to reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. OUR enemy is not Russia and China. The mortal enemy of Native Born White Americans are the Reublican and Democratic parties.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are paying a terrible price for going along with the cold war. With high probability, it may cost them majority racial status within the borders of America.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to me how this was written by someone with a Russian or slavic name.  The Russian and eastern Europeans seem to be the only whites that can express the desire for nationalism.  Young whites have been raised to worship diversity and multiculturalism.  They&rsquo;ve been raised to criticize white culture and the white race.  They will never support white nationalism.  Every time I visit these white nationalist websites I suspect the majority of the members are elderly white men.  Let&rsquo;s face it - the US, Canada and w. Europe are finished.  I just hope Russia and eastern Europe will learn from this to advance and help indigenous whites have a home to call their own.  </p>

			<p>I was saddened by the first comment. It shows just how much &#8216;conservative&rsquo; thinking has been polluted by neo-cons whose hatred of Russia has more to do with 19th century pogroms than with current reality.</p>
<p>Russia has a longstanding policy of not wanting unfriendly states on its border. That may seem &#8216;evil&rsquo; or paranoid to some of us, but it&rsquo;s quite understandable given Russia&rsquo;s history (hint: Napoleon, Hitler).</p>
<p>But Russia does not want more territory. It has all it can do to maintain and populate its current territory.</p>

			<p>the problem is that only a few of us see this coming, and the mass of white voters are completely blind to it and continue to vote in politicians that betray them&hellip;..da da, and the reason is? because those politicians continue to promise them something for free, and most whites have turned into blacks and have developed a poor ol me attitude,they want the government to take care of them. it sounds like this, promise me something free and i will vote for you, then you can go to washington and pass all the anti-white legislation you can. i wont even know it.</p>

<p>  Do not forget the central European nations of Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia etc&hellip; These nations are ivory white. During my stay in Krakow (Poland) I saw and met only one non White in a big crowded beautiful busy city full of attractive White people. That non White was a black man who looked very uncomfortable all the time. In Wroclaw, a big busy city in Poland, I did not meet a single non White, The city is crowded with Poles.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;All because of a very smart evil dictator using our diversity against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>This hate Russia mindset is tired and old, and plays into the hands of the leftists who now control our country. In fact, our &#8220;diversity&#8221; is working against our country far more effectively than the old cold war ever did. </p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20.  One of the regrets we should have about the Cold War era is that we were too fanatical about the Soviet Union.  When they ran over Afghanistan, we sent in covert (and not so covert) aid to help them resist the Soviets.  And our aid wound up inadvertently creating AQ/OBL/Taliban, which in turn bit us back on 9/11.  Knowing what we know now, we should have helped the Soviets overrun Afghanistan, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Also note that part of the reason the Soviet Union fell is that the quagmire that was their attempt to occupy the country cost them a whole lot of resources.  Nobody has ever successfully occupied Afghanistan; it&rsquo;s easy to topple their weak governments but subduing them is a different story.  We should have thumped them then got right out after 9/11.</p>
<p>My rule of thumb, if I ever get serious political power:  White countries should not actively side with non-white countries to oppose or fight other white countries, no matter how abhorrent they find the political ideology of the other white country.</p>

			<p>Here is a little anecdote for your enjoyment.  My parents are educated American liberals who decided to raise their children in a non-white, Third World country for the adventure.</p>
<p>Back in the early 60s we went to Fort Lauderdale, FL for a vacation.  At that time Fort Lauderdale was overwhelmingly white.  I had never seen many whites before.  Friendly, smiling whites were here and there, on the street, in the restaurants, and I remember as a little six-year-old girl being stunned and thinking, &#8220;White people are so beautiful!&#8221; </p>
<p>So, yes, whites are a rare, unique, intelligent and beautiful minority race, and we deserve the right to survive.</p>

			<p>&#8220;By that time, the continent as a whole will face a net loss of some 150 million people. Europe&rsquo;s population has aged to such a degree that it will continue to shrink even in the unlikely event that birthrates rebound to the replacement level. This &ldquo;negative momentum&rdquo; means that even if women in the future should have an unexpected fertility increase to two children on average, the population would be destined to continue shrinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t buy into this doom and gloom prediction.  Russia is well on it&rsquo;s way to recovering from the demographic implosion it experienced the last two decades.  There are about 750 million people in Europe.  If just 13 percent of that total or about 100 million couples were to have four children the net result would be 200 million new children in the next several years.  It&rsquo;s not impossible because a certain percentage of a population (I&rsquo;m not sure what it is) always has big families.  This wouldn&rsquo;t even take into account what the other 87 percent are doing.  </p>

			<p>Horatio, the reason why our leaders took up NAFTA instead of going with Europe etc is because the people who put NAFTA together (including the man pulling Obama&rsquo;s strings, Rahm Emanuel) wanted the US to eventually fail. In fact, seeing Emanuel and Peter Orszag running Obama&rsquo;s economic policy means we are going to hit rock bottom. Orszag was one of the &#8220;advisors&#8221; that sank Iceland&rsquo;s economy, not to mention his work on Wall Street helping to engineer that collapse (you can look all of this up). The powers that be want the West to crumble. We&rsquo;re in for a wild ride and big fight. </p>

			<p>Everyone assumes that the decline in the white birth rate is permanent, but if there were a major war, and many &#8220;only children&#8221; were killed, the practice of having tiny families might well go out of fashion.  </p>
<p>If the Social Security system goes bust, or Zimbabwean/Weimar style inflation occurs, big families will once again be seen as security for old age.</p>
<p>Social Security doesn&rsquo;t let you work AND collect benefits when you are in your sixties.  If the over-65s could work part time for a small salary and enhanced (on top of Medicare) medical benefits, I think that lots of them would do so.  We don&rsquo;t need the blasted illegals.  With a little tinkering with our rule book, and some additional labor-saving machinery, we can manage fine.</p>
