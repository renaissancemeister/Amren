			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, March 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a time when America has elected its first black president, more African-American men are losing jobs than at any time since World War II.</p>
<p>No group has been hit harder by the downturn. Employment among black men has fallen 7.8 percent since November of 2007, according to a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>
<p>The trend is intimately tied to education, the report&rsquo;s authors say. Black women  &mdash;  who are twice as likely as black men to go to college  &mdash;  have faced no net job losses. By contrast, black men are disproportionately employed in those blue-collar jobs that have been most highly affected  &mdash;  think third shifts at rural manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>It threatens to add to the difficulties of vulnerable families in a community already beset by high incarceration rates and low graduation numbers.</p>
<p>Moreover, it puts renewed focus on the cultural and economic stereotypes of black women and men  &mdash;  mythologies and realities about the black family that remain challenging for the country, and Washington, to address.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The job-loss figures come at a time when many lower-income black homeowners are already at risk of foreclosure. &#8220;They have zero opportunity to refinance or borrow in any way to get over the rough patch of unemployment,&#8221; writes Tom Hertz, a labor economist, in an e-mail.</p>
<p>The employment rate among African-American men aged 20 to 24 is now just 51 percent, as opposed to 68 percent during the late 1990s. For African-American teens, it&rsquo;s just 14 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet black men can be bound as much by deeper labor trends as cultural stereotypes, says Peter Rachleff, a labor historian at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. Especially in the South, black men often pay a price for demanding workplace rights gained in the Civil Rights movement  &mdash;  demands for days off and being able to say no to overtime, for example. Hispanic workers, particularly, aren&rsquo;t as likely to claim those rights, making them easier hires, says Professor Rachleff.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can call it a class thing, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what it is,&#8221; says Douglas Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland in College Park. &#8220;Some of it is long-term discrimination and lack of access to education, but much more in this recession it&rsquo;s determined by which sector that&rsquo;s suffering the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>From November of 2007, the month before the official start of the recession, to February of 2009, &#8220;there was no net job loss among professionals or managers,&#8221; says Sum [Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies].</p>
<p>Contradicting media reports that job loss has been widespread in this recession, he adds: &#8220;All the job loss has been among blue-collar jobs  &mdash;  construction, manufacturing, and retail.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the jobs black men have long sought, settling for high-school diplomas in order to get these relatively well paid posts, suggests Terry Getter, an unemployed accountant waiting in line at the Atlanta unemployment office. But they are now feeling the consequences of not continuing their education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Correspondingly, his data suggest that, as of January, about 120 African-American women were employed for every 100 African-American men. &#8220;The current size of the overall gap in employment between black women and black men is historically unprecedented, and black Americans are the only group for whom the gender employment gap is in favor of women,&#8221; the report notes.</p>
<p>As a result, the onus for the community&rsquo;s well-being has fallen primarily on women, adding more burdens to a group that, historically, has upheld the black family, says Sheri Parks, author of the upcoming book &#8220;Fierce Angels&#8221; about the role of strong black women in American culture.</p>
<p>Part of the reason, she says, is that black communities have historically protected young men and expected more of young women, particularly when it comes to schooling. &#8220;If you&rsquo;re a black woman, you don&rsquo;t have to convince someone that you&rsquo;re strong and nurturing and able to do almost anything  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s almost a brand,&#8221; says Ms. Parks. &#8220;The prevalent image of a black man is what we call hyper-masculine and often idealized, but not necessarily in the workplace.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Some of it is long-term discrimination and lack of access to education, but much more in this recession it&rsquo;s determined by which sector that&rsquo;s suffering the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lack of access to education?  Is that supposed to be a joke?  No matter what grade they complete, most of them still can&rsquo;t read, write or do basic math. And nobody can make them stay in school no matter what they do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s fault but theirs, right?</p>
<p>Wait until we move on into the latter part of this year and next, when even a good portion of mestizos will be out of work.<br>
I think we&rsquo;re going to see things get a little heated in the black/Hispanic realm in this country.</p>
<p>Sorry to say so, but it&rsquo;s going to be a real treat for me to read the liberal rags bemoaning the black/mestizo gap in employment, and hopefully things will be so crushed these lefties will be too busy trying to survive themselves to complain about the lack of black employment, blaming it on racism or whatever they can think to charge whites with at the time.</p>
<p>We should never let a serious crisis go to waste, Emanuel?  LOL!<br>

			<p>Black men are probably the least employable group in the country. Little wonder they would be the hardest hit by a recession.</p>

			<p>This really does not surprise me. I was in a upscale restaurant in Washington D.C. with my wife last month. We are White. We noticed how many more professional looking Black women were in the restaurant than men. In fact, the only Black males we saw were a father and two teenage boys who looked like his sons. <br>
We were in D.C. for a week. We saw this sitaution most places we went - many well dressed, upscale looking Black women and very few Black men who fit this description. </p>
<p>At one poiont my wife mentioned to me that she could see why black women would be frustrated about their marriage prospects or would decide to marry White or other non-Black. I thought about her comment and I honestly have to agree with her. This is alarming. Such an economic disparity between Black women and Black men cannot be good for their people. </p>
<p>I am glad that we Whites do not have such a dilemma.  </p>

			<p>So many of these &#8216;Stimulus Obama jobs&rsquo; are going to go to Black women - thus discriminating against Whites of both genders and all ages.</p>

			<p>I think part of the reason why black women have not gone backwards in terms of employment rates is that they possess two affirmative action qualifiers, gender and race.  And because so many Personnel/HR departments are filling with black women, and have in recent years, they&rsquo;re more likely to protect black women employees when it is time for layoffs.</p>
<p>As you can see, black men are in fierce competition with Hispanics for jobs.   Yet, they&rsquo;ll vote for open borders politicians almost universally.  This article tells of an unemployed accountant, a lot of accountant work is being outsourced to Bangalore and Manila.</p>

			<p>You mean DEMANDING a day off and saying no to overtime can acually keep you from getting and/or keeping a job! Whoda thunk! Next thing you know &#8220;the man&#8221; will be able to not hire or fire you for not working while on the clock. What&rsquo;s this &#8220;whirl&#8221; coming to!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s something Tyra Banks has been saying a lot lately, urging her protege&rsquo;s to be &#8216;fierce&rsquo;. Tyra is extremely white-acting, if you ask me. Cute anyway.   </p>

			<p>The simple solution to the problem is to kick the illegals out of the country. The Blacks have to realize that they are being sold down the river by the Democrats and their leaders for the Hispanic vote.</p>

			<p>If the blacks were educated, self reliant and innovated to start their own companies, like all the white/yellow races, this wouldn&rsquo;t be so.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a gender thing, really. <br>
Job losses for white men are worse than that for white women as well. <br>
why? <br>
Because construction and finance have been hit, while education and health care have gone up. </p>
<p>Conspiracy? </p>

			<p>Sorry, I find it hard to believe that companies are firing a great number of black males.</p>
<p>Quitting? Yes   Fired? No</p>

<p>Again note the passive language, the community is beset&hellip;. There is no responsibility for the high incarceration rates and low graduation numbers. Is the community at fault or those individuals whose anti-social behavior is the root cause?</p>

			<p>Black women are likelier than black men to occupy the myriad affirmative action, make-work jobs in government and business, which are essentially lifetime sinecures. I&rsquo;ve never heard of any government agency, budget crises notwithstanding, having to fire an office full of useless, desk-occupying black women. Michelle Obama comes to mind; her six-figure position was not even important enough to warrant a replacement for her, but she would never have been let go.</p>

			<p>It is pretty hard to find work when you are a convicted felony esp. three times over.  Black males are the least employable people in the country.  I would bar felons from getting welfare, if I was in charge.</p>

			<p>In my overwhelmingly White town, Black women seem to occupy the majority of county and city jobs, and women most of the other positions.  It is difficult to find a White man with a county or city job.  Most White are in contruction or related jobs, so more of us are sitting at home, growing less happy beginning to loose our homes, etc.  In the Northwest at least, White men are the ones who need the bail-out.</p>
