<h1>Ten Inmates Charged With Hate Crimes After White Prisoners Beaten in Lafourche Jail</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Planchet, WWL-TV (New Orleans), March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten inmates have been charged with hate crimes after two incidents that left a couple of white prisoners beaten unconscious in the Lafourche Parish Detention Center.</p>
<p>Sheriff Craig Webre said that internal investigation showed that the attacks, which occurred on Monday, March 10 and Friday, March 13, were motivated solely by race. He said the investigation showed that a 28-year-old inmate, James Ingram, had made a statement that several white boys had to leave the cellblock &#8220;on their own or through the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the investigation, two inmates were beaten by a gang of eight shortly before midnight in the first attack and three were beaten by a group of seven prisoners in the second instance. {snip}</p>
<p>Webre said one of the main issues facing the Detention Center is overcrowding. He said that the facility has a maximum population of 245 and that as many as 100 inmates have been parceled out to nearby parishes.</p>
<p>Those charged in the beatings include:</p>
<p>- Antoine Baptiste (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- Prentiss Davis (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- Scottywade Gisclair (W/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- James Hester (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- James Ingram (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- Trent Robertson (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- Cadarren Turner (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- Ryan Zeringue (W/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>- Calvin Hester (B/M, {snip}), {snip}</p>
<p>Webre said two of those charged were white prisoners who claim they were intimidated into joining the beating or face a similar fate.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday afternoon investigators also announced 44-year old Terry Wheaton (B/M, DOB 10/5/1964) would be charged with being a principle to hate crimes and 2nd degree battery.  Investigators say Wheaton acted as the ringleader and organizer of the attacks on inmates, creating his own &#8220;gang&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said that the hate crime charges stem from the fact that the group &#8216;banded together&rsquo; to attack their victims.</p>

			<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s not necessarily &#8220;overcrowding&#8221; that started these problems, it&rsquo;s forced integration of correctional environments.  That&rsquo;s what the most recent printed issue of AR is about, mainly jail, prison and school fights between various groups of non-whites.</p>

			<p>  Blacks that are in prison for murder, attacking and or rape of mostly White victims shouldn&rsquo;t be mixed with Whites for any reason, many blacks are there for crimes commited against Whites, so prison won&rsquo;t stop their hatred of Whites.</p>

			<p>In the video there&rsquo;s a white guy and a bunch of blacks attacking a white and another white laying on a bunk seemingly ignoring the whole thing. If the three had cooperated maybe they could have held their own in close quarters like that. A lesson to keep in mind if you ever find yourself in an unfriendly county jail.</p>

			<p>Have the White lemmings awakened yet? How many black on White crimes do they have to read before it sinks in? Or do they still believe it is because of White &#8220;racism&#8221; that blacks do what blacks have always done since their existence? </p>

			<p>If they can get the charges to stick, this could be a monumental step in the right direction for meaningful White civil rights court decisions.</p>

			<p>How horrible.  I don&rsquo;t know what I would do in such a horrible scenario, it&rsquo;s easy to pose and take a macho stand on the internet, much harder when confronted with violence.  But it certainly symbolizes the present day situation of whites: join the anti-white lynch mob or be lynched yourself.  The idea of white solidarity is completely shattered.  If the two whites who were forced to join this lynch mob, instead joined forces with the other two whites, they would still be outnumbered.  Still, had they done so, it might have given all the whites a better chance in the long run.  Black mobs might be more reluctant to attack outnumbered whites in the future if they banded together and inflicted some retaliatory pain on them instead.</p>

			<p>Notice how the story carefully avoids using the word that we all know they are avoiding. What could it be? They aren&rsquo;t afraid to use the word White! Why do they deliberately suppress the word - the word which we already know.</p>

			<p>Gee, I thought only whites were capable of &#8220;hate&#8221;? Meanwhile, I see divide and conquer is still on schedule.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I watched the video and the white guy looked like he didn&rsquo;t need any coercion to jump in.  It may have been about something else.</p>

			<p>This reminds me of a video I watched awhile back on a white nationalist website.  It showcased three white, convenient store workers fighting with black customers.  The whites were outnumbered 3:1, but they grouped together and fought one black at a time, all while the other blacks stood there, too scared to even move.</p>
<p>I saw a similar video as well.  It showed about five white security guards (your average joe kind) running a group of 10 blacks out of a mall.  The blacks were enraged and yelling insults, but they were running from the security guards.  Why was that?  The whites worked together and fought (or in this case prepared to fight) as a group.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is group together with other whites and defend yourself!  Blacks may be violent and dangerous, but they&rsquo;re not that tough.</p>

			<p>In prison it is BLACKS WHO ARE THE MAJORITY and they can do to Whites as they please. AND THEY DO.</p>

			<p>We all know blacks have to have a ratio of 10 to 1 to consider it a &#8220;fair&#8221; fight. I remember the days when it was only Whites who had any rules of what constituted fair. Blacks never picked up on it then or now. Goes to show that diverse races cannot live among each other. Let all live among their own!  Now that is what is FAIR! </p>

<p>You may have a point there. Alliances between prison gangs can produce strange bedfellows (pardon the pun). A deal struck between the leader of a White gang and the leader of Black gang #1 to kill Black gang #2&rsquo;s leader in return for BG #1 leaving Whites alone, for example. Plus a White guy might be &#8220;making his bones&#8221; along with it. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my feeling from watching the video.  It may have been about drugs or snitching.</p>
