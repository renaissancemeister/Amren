			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the latest move intended to flex their legislative muscle, amnesty supporters in Congress last week re-introduced the DREAM Act (also known as the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act).  Authored by Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) (S.729) and Congressman Howard Berman (H.R.1751), the DREAM Act grants amnesty to a broad range of individuals who meet certain minimal educational requirements and broad definitions relating to student status.</p>
<p>While the text of the legislation has not been officially posted, previous versions of the bill have:</p>
<p>* granted broad-based amnesty to illegal aliens who entered the country before a certain age if they can meet minimal educational standards;</p>
<p>* changed federal law to allow states to subsidize college tuition for illegal aliens even when that subsidy is not available to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants attending a state college; and</p>
<p>* rendered moot any lawsuits filed by U.S. citizens against a state or colleges when state law allowed colleges to grant in-state tuition without offering the same benefit to U.S. citizens not residing in the state.  (FAIR Legislative Analysis, May 2007).</p>
<p>Immigration reformers and political observers are waiting to see whether the text of latest DREAM Act is more or less restrictive.</p>
<p>The Senate bill has 7 cosponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-MA) as well as Republican Senators Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Mel Martinez (R-FL).  The House bill has 9 co-sponsors, including House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers (D-MI), and Chair of the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, Zoe Lofgren (D-CA).<br>

			<p>It will never end until we decide once and for all to end all this nonsense our government is DOING to us! </p>
<p> Found out today they are taking the raise that the social security/SSI got last year here in California starting in the May payment. It is $37 a month for the disabled in CA that they will have to give up! They barely make it with that small raise and now the State is taking all of it back through their SSI payment. Yet the state sure does pay for all these illegals getting everything under the sun for free at our expense. Thanks alot Arnie and the Democrat controlled legislature!!! They give lip service to the poor for their vote and then stab them in the back in favor of the illegals! I didn&rsquo;t vote for Arnie(wrote in Tom McClintock) or any Democrat and never will as I can see what they are. We work and pay into the system for decades and this is how they repay us. </p>

			<p>&#8220;It is $37 a month for the disabled in CA that they will have to give up! They barely make it with that small raise and now the State is taking all of it back. Yet the state sure does pay for all these illegals getting everything under the sun for free at our expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was riding on the San Diego bus last week  and saw an announcement that  because of the budget crunch the state of Cal. has  &#8220;eliminated&#8221; (not cut)  all subsidies to public transportation throughout the state.   This will cost San Diego $14 million annually.  It is going to result in reduced service, routes dropped, and increases in fares.  Many people, especially elderly,  will feel the hardship.   </p>
<p>But still there is money for illegals!  And for psychos like the Octomom and her famous but fatherless family of fourteen.</p>
