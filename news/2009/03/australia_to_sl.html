			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Australia is set to protect its workers during the looming recession by slashing its intake of skilled migrants for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>The 14 per cent cut in immigration come on a wave of concern that skilled foreign workers could stoke resentment by taking jobs at a time of rising unemployment.</p>
<p>One expert slammed the situation as &#8216;madness&rsquo; after mine workers in Queensland and Western Australia found that their positions were being filled by foreign workers.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Chris Evans, who removed hairdressers and cooks off Australia&rsquo;s critical occupation shortage list at Christmas, said he was now also deleting foreign bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters and electricians from the list that guides skilled migration intake.</p>
<p>Further cuts were likely in the May 12 budget, he said, leaving only health occupations, engineering and information technology skills as needed skills.</p>
<p>&#8216;What we&rsquo;ll look to do is run a smaller programme and keep the capacity to make sure we can bring in any labour we might need as the year develops,&rsquo; Evans said.</p>
<p>A recession is looming in the country, with the centre-left government expecting unemployment to reach seven percent midway through next year.</p>
<p>The country is also due to hold an election in late 2010. Immigration has been a charged issue in past polls, particularly following economic downturn.</p>
<p>A leading migration expert, former government official Bob Kinnaird, said record recent migrant arrivals in a fast shrinking job market were leading to &#8216;highly combustible&rsquo; conditions in regional areas, where many new arrivals had settled.</p>
<p>In Queensland and Western Australia retrenched mine workers returning to their home towns found that jobs there had been filled by foreign workers, sparking resentment, Kinnaird said.</p>
<p>&#8216;You could say in those last few months that madness has reigned,&rsquo; he told the Brisbane Times newspaper.</p>
<p>The ruling Labor Party, with its roots in the workers&rsquo; movement, should have acted sooner to cut migration as economic conditions cooled to lance any voter backlash and ease tensions in critical country voting areas, he said.</p>
<p>But the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the government needed to be wary of tinkering with immigration, as many skilled employment areas still faced a worker shortage and lack of workers could crimp an economic recovery.</p>
<p>&#8216;We would have preferred a status quo position,&rsquo; chamber Chief Executive Peter Anderson said.</p>
<p>Australia is a nation of immigrants. The country has been enjoying a boom in new arrivals for the past decade to help meet labour shortages as a China-fuelled mining boom drove unemployment rates to 30-year lows.</p>
<p>But those days are over now. Six of Australia&rsquo;s major trading partners are now in recession and economic growth has stalled.</p>
<p>The country moved a step closer to recession this month with the first contraction in eight years and the economy shrinking by 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s jobless rate spiked to 5.2 per cent from 4.8 per cent last month with the biggest impact felt by full-time workers. Some economists fear unemployment levels could go as high as 10 per cent.</p>
<p>A government minister said today the immigration intake next year would be cut to 115,000, from 133,500 in 2008-09.</p>
<p>The government hopes its recently announced A$42 billion ($27.5 billion) stimulus package, including cash handouts and infrastructure spending, will help the economy through the downturn.<br>

			<p>I live in the City of Brisbane. There is no such publication as The Brisbane Times&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;get your facts sorted out or people will doubt the rest of your article!!</p>
<p>As an adder I believe that immigration of non skilled workers &amp; refugees / asylum seekers should also be sharply cut to prevent competition in the social welfare lines and further strains on the country&rsquo;s finances.</p>

			<p>I have a suspicion that these cuts will affect mostly European immigrants who want to move to Australia.</p>

			<p>133000 to 115000 is a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>It should be 133000 to zero, and then the deportations should start and continue until the place is clean again.</p>
<p>Put a bounty on them.</p>

			<p>The thing I can&rsquo;t comprehend is why the US has such a permissively liberal appraoch to immigration. Australia and even &#8216;leftist&rsquo; Canada have point systems for assesing who can gain entry, thus a larger share of their legal immigrants are from Europe and have skills (although non-whites do make up a very significant part of the overall flow). Plus we&rsquo;re the only developed country with birth right citizenship and the issue of how many legal immigrants we let in is almost never discussed by politicains. Most &#8216;Conservative&rsquo; Republicans will pay lip service to the subject of ILLEGAL immigration, but almost never talk about the legal kind. Why is this madness alowed in the US!?</p>

			<p>This sounds like good news I guess, it will probably only be for a short time though .</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different line to what our Government was saying just three weeks ago. That even though employment is rising and job vacancies are falling &#8220;we&rsquo;re not going to cut back on immigration&#8221; (as you can imagine, as a Amren reader I just rolled my eyes). <br>
&#8216;Govt rejects call to cut immigration&rsquo;<br>
https://tinyurl.com/ck5z4f</p>
<p>Our immigration intake is divided into three categories.<br>
<b>Skill stream, Family stream  and our Humanitarian stream</b>.</p>
<p>This article talks about cutting back on our <b>&#8216;Skill stream&rsquo;</b> intake. Which according to the following .pdf report, Australia is a blue collar country that owes it&rsquo;s prosperity to the highly educated Asians it imports (whereas in the States your immigrants are less educated than your general population thus they just depress blue collar wages&hellip;.it&rsquo;s a interesting read, but it also made me very sad for a couple of weeks).<br>

(Penned by Mr Garnaut, Mr Ganguly and Mr Kang for the Australian commonwealth Government in 2003).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a blue collar guy myself, but I can see from watching the news that we are all being affected in the same way from this global recession just on a smaller scale i.e Your job losses in January were 500,00, and we&rsquo;re losing about 5,000 a week.<br>
And I assume white collar job security is connected to growth.<br>
Our agricultural industry is pretty much dead (thanks to the environment), manufactering is shedding about 10% of it&rsquo;s jobs annually (and what is left is hanging in by a thread with huge Government subsidies and tax breaks). Interestingly the resources boom (mining) has been what&rsquo;s keeping us afloat, as the Chinese have been buying our mineral resources to make into their products to sell to you guys. Since US retail has stalled our mining industry orders have decreasd by about 60% and now Chiese companies are trying to buy our mining companies.<br>
&#8216;Chinalco bid could have diplomatic consequences&rsquo;<br>

<p>The difference between the Eastern and Western business mindsets seems to be they&rsquo;re long term thinkers while we are very short term thinkers.</p>
<p>Immigration, big business and our Government policies are all in bed together.<br>
And us whites are being punished for being historically responsible breeders.<br>
Business and Government wants lots of tax payers and consumers here asap, and they don&rsquo;t really care about the quality just quantity. Training our unskilled youth or promoting highr birth rates amongst whites just takes too long (we have got baby bonus pay outs, but when my partner was in hospital, we while the only anglo whites in the ward).</p>
<p>&#8216;Fact Sheet 15 - Population Projections&rsquo;<br>
https://tinyurl.com/dchhd2<br>
We&rsquo;re currentlty on 1.6% growth per year and 1.2% is our minimumal ideal. And depending on the fertility rates, our projected population for 2056 based on babies per woman:<br>
2  - 42.5 million<br>
1.8- 35.5 m<br>
1.6- 30.9 m</p>
<p>From the other two immigration schemes, Family and Humanitarian.<br>
Family is for relatives from both the Humanitarian and skilled categories.<br>
I&rsquo;ll mention something about the Humanitarian category in my next post.</p>

			<p>As I previousily mentioned, our immigration intake is divided into three categories.<br>
<b>Skill stream, Family stream  and our Humanitarian stream</b>.</p>
<p>I think most Australians just think we have one category.<br>
And frustratingily whenever there&rsquo;s a debate on immigration, it&rsquo;s always the ex-pats Brits, Irish and other ex European descended peoples who do all the talking and defend immigration. And most Ozzies go away thinking that immigration is actually pretty good.</p>
<p>But from what I gather we get the most of our trouble from the Humanitarian stream (ironically). <br>
And it all comes from foreign cultures not being able to assimulate to our way of life. And language difficulties are a huge factor (according to the official documents I read only 3% of non English speaking professionals are working in their field after three years in Oz without learning English proficently).</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that given a choice between the war torn hell hole that they come from and living in any Western country the choice would be odvious. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they neccassarily like us here.</p>

<a href="https://tinyurl.com/dfmaxe" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/dfmaxe</a></p>
<p>On hand we get positive propaganda saying proudly that we have 400 different languages spoken here in Oz.<br>
And then we get the &#8216;bleeding hearts&rsquo; saying that it&rsquo;s certain groups inability to learn English that stops them earning a wage that leads to criminal activities and so on. <br>
And us celebrating our traditional white Australian culture stops the assimulation process also, as it makes them feel alien.</p>
<p>&#8216;Celebrate cultural diversity in Victoria&rsquo;<br>

<p>Part of our motivation for our Humanitarian stream, is as a insurance policy for international aid if Indonesia implodes for instances.<br>
And there is external pressure to comply also.<br>

It&rsquo;s ironic that these perps will be in this country for Humanitarian reasons, when they don&rsquo;t seem to be very humane themselves.</p>
<p>When I read about events in South Africa, the U.K. and the States, it makes me appreciate how we are just beginning down the same path your countries are already way further down (with S.A. leading the way of course).<br>
Makes me sad that we are following.</p>

			<p>Fourteen percent isn&rsquo;t much but at least it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction and an acknowledgement from the Australian government that there is a connection between large scale immigration and unemployment (something you would think would be obvious but very few Western governments seem to have figured out).</p>

			<p>a 14% drop in immigration into the USA would mean around 2,000,000 men still get in.</p>

<p>Of course, anything to keep wages down irrespective of the social impacts.</p>
<p>In terms of the &#8216;nation of immigrants&rsquo; comment, I think Associate Professor Andrew Fraser&rsquo;s paper on this makes interesting reading.</p>

			<p>The reason immigration in the United States is almost unrestricted is because it is profitable.   More people means more market activity.</p>
<p>The citizens have no longer have a say in the matter.  </p>
