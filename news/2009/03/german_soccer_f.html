<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany&rsquo;s soccer federation denounced &#8220;racist campaigns&#8221; against national team players Monday ahead of a trial in which officials from the country&rsquo;s leading far-right party are accused of racial incitement and defamation.</p>
<p>National Democratic Party leader Udo Voigt and two other party leaders are to appear in a Berlin district court Tuesday on charges linked to a pamphlet circulated before the 2006 World Cup.</p>
<p>Prosecutors maintain that the document implied Patrick Owomoyela  &mdash;  born of a German mother and a Nigerian father  &mdash;  was not worthy to play for Germany.</p>
<p>The flier showed the German team&rsquo;s traditional white jersey imprinted with the No. 25  &mdash;  worn at the time by Owomoyela  &mdash;  over the title: &#8220;White, not just a jersey color! For a real NATIONAL team!&#8221;</p>
<p>Owomoyela and the soccer federation filed a lawsuit against the party. In a statement Monday, the federation said it wanted to fight &#8220;the racist campaigns against players for the German national team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors have charged Voigt and two others responsible for printing the leaflets with two counts of racial incitement and one of defamation. If convicted, the three could each face a fine or up to three years in prison.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Germany&rsquo;s criminal justice system, but I hope for the sake of Voigt and the others that the jury pool happens to come from white people close to a U.S. military base, with all its black American soldiers that rape German (white) women and that use the German welfare system.  They want Yankee to take his troops and go home just as much as to take their/our blacks home as they are upset with decades of military occupation.</p>

The German soccer federation should bring in more players like Robinho. Maybe that would placate calls for German players:</p>

All is not lost yet. The Germans and Serbs still look like they did 100 years ago. The German Anthem by Haydyn, is very stirring.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Patrick Owomoyela &mdash; born of a German mother and a Nigerian father &mdash; was not worthy to play for Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why oh why do so many White women insist on destroying their own race through their wombs?  I really think that they should not have the right to destroy 50,000 years of genetic development with one sexual act.</p>
<p>I do hope that one day, at least Germany and other indigenous White nations will at least set up a caste system such as India still has, that will seperate - at least socially, such issue from the real natives.</p>

			<p><i>Patrick Owomoyela &mdash; born of a German mother and a Nigerian father</i></p>
<p>A slightly off-topic point here   &mdash;   has anyone ever eaten at a Nigerian restaurant?  Or seen an ethnic Nigerian neighborhood?  I&rsquo;ve seen many Ethiopian restaurants, even Ghanaian ones, but even while living in Washington DC, which has a ton of African immigrants, I never once saw a Nigerian place.  </p>
<p>It seems to me that Nigerian men have little or no loyalty to their own culture and society, and simply shack up with whatever white woman they can find, by and large, in the manner of some sort of genetic parasite leeching off its white host.  Compare them with the super-ethnocentric Chinese or Pakistanis, who at least have the self-respect to stay with their own.</p>

			<p>The big picture is not this Patrick fellow&rsquo;s eligibility to play for the German team.  He seems to be a citizen, and every civilization has had a tiny minority of citizens who had offspring with someone outside their race.  Most civilizations can easily tolerate and withstand this. </p>
<p>One of international communism&rsquo;s goals is a single world state.  If you can define away the German people, and replace them with outsiders, the German state will simply fade away.  </p>

<p>If the Pakistani woman is a muslim and does NOT stay with her own kind, it can cost her her life.</p>

			<p>Jury Pool? Forget it, in Germany trial by jury is unheard of. The Germans are subjected to a trial by one or more judges making a mockery out of justice for the most part. </p>

			<p>You are right Anonymous. Germany has no jury. There is a judge and maybe two civilians who may voice their opinion.</p>
<p>But in the anti-fascist climate i think nobody would dare to bet on the outcome. The people of the NPD are punished.</p>
<p>The judges remember what happened to the last of them who showed some spine.</p>

<p> I agree with you Whiteplight. I hope that at least some white homelands will retain their indigenous character. Perhaps, Americas rapid economic decline and gradual social disintegration will be a lesson to them.</p>

			<p><i>If the Pakistani woman is a muslim and does NOT stay with her own kind, it can cost her her life.</i></p>
<p>True enough   &mdash;   but that still goes to the values of the society itself.  It&rsquo;s a nasty culture, but one that does seem to value its members staying within the fold, you have to admit.   </p>
<p>Compared to the Africans whose desire simply seems to be to dissolve into the white population, leaving no legacy other than a darkening gene pool.</p>

			<p>It would seem only logical that the &#8220;German&#8221; team should be German. The Italian team should be Italian. Etc.<br>
What is wrong with that?  </p>
<p>But, oh no!  In this one-world, anti-racist climate, that can&rsquo;t be allowed. All races, and now even nations, must be abolished. <br>
Next thing, will it be families too?  Everyone must get integrated! Everyone must be miscegenated!  They are determined to put us all through a blender. How far will this mania go? </p>

<p>Not everyone.  Not all.  To every rule there is an exception. </p>
<p>This program is obviously designed for Europeans (no matter where in the world they may be found). The Chinese, for example, and probably certain other special groups will be left alone. Only whites of <i>European descent </i> will be put through the blender. They have to be eliminated, at all costs.  Those of non-European origin will be exempted.</p>
