<p>Youth for Western Civilization</p>

</div> 



<p><b>Our mission</b></p>
<p>Youth for Western Civilization will educate, organize and train activists on campuses across the nation to create a subculture that will promote the survival of Western Civilization and pride in Western heritage. This movement is focused on the support of Western history, identity, high culture, and pride and opposition to radical multiculturalism, political correctness, racial preferences, mass immigration, and socialism.</p>
<p><b>What Is Youth for Western Civilization?</b></p>
<p>Youth for Western Civilization is the West&rsquo;s right wing youth movement. This is an organization for students who believe Western Civilization is moving in the wrong direction and want to do something about it. This is for people who are proud to be members of the West and want to work in defense of their people, culture, and traditions.</p>
<p>This will include hosting speakers and debates, hosting and attending conferences, holding protests and educational events, producing publications, creating social events, and all other activities that will further the organization&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p><b>What We Want to Accomplish</b></p>
<p>We want a campus movement that will accomplish three things:</p>
<p>1. Inspire Western youth to organize on the basis of identity, with pride in their heritage and their history, and counter radical multiculturalism on campus.</p>
<p>2. Counter and ultimately defeat leftism on campus by pushing the activist agenda, changing college policies in a conservative or right wing direction, and restoring a curriculum that focuses on Western history, not political correctness.</p>
<p>3. Create a social movement on campus where a right wing subculture-similar to the left wing subculture that currently exists-will provide a healthy alternative to a poisonous and bigoted left wing campus climate.</p>
<p><b>Our long term strategy</b></p>
<p>Initially, we would to set up as many active campus chapters as possible that will host events such as speakers, debates, and protests.</p>
<p>In the medium term, we want these groups to take over student governments, defend against left wing organizations and create new right wing groups. We also want to change the social atmosphere of the school, with YWC becoming the focus of social life at the school as well as political activism.</p>
<p>In the long term, we want the majority of students to leave college more right wing than when they arrived. Eventually, we would like to start changing curriculums on campus to restore an emphasis on real education and classical learning, rather than trendy multiculturalism.</p>
