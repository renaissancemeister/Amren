			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gautam Naik, Wall Street Journal, March 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The old-fashioned police sketch is getting a makeover.</p>
<p>Researchers are identifying genes that give rise to a person&rsquo;s physical traits, such as facial structure, skin color or even whether they are right- or left-handed. That could allow police to build a picture of what a criminal looks like not just from sometimes-fuzzy eyewitness accounts, but by analyzing DNA found at a crime scene.</p>
<p>Forensic experts are increasingly relying on DNA as &#8220;a genetic eyewitness,&#8221; says Jack Ballantyne, associate director for research at the National Center for Forensic Science at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who is studying whether a DNA sample can reveal a person&rsquo;s age. {snip}</p>
<p>The push to predict physical features from genetic material is known as DNA forensic phenotyping, and it&rsquo;s already helped crack some difficult investigations. In 2004, police caught a Louisiana serial killer who eyewitnesses had suggested was white, but whose crime-scene DNA suggested  &mdash;  correctly  &mdash;  that he was black. Britain&rsquo;s forensic service uses a similar &#8220;ethnic inference&#8221; test to trace murderers and rapists.</p>
<p>In 2007, a DNA test based on 34 genetic biomarkers developed by Christopher Phillips, a forensic geneticist at the University of Santiago de Compostelo in Spain, indicated that one of the suspects associated with the Madrid bombings was of North African origin. His body was mostly destroyed in an explosion. Using other clues, police later confirmed he had been an Algerian, thereby validating the test results.</p>
<p>But the technique is still in early stages of development, and no one has developed a gene-based police sketch yet. There are big challenges. The technology currently has limited accuracy and can send law enforcement officials on the wrong track. It has also prompted ethical concerns.</p>
<p>For example, tests to assess a person&rsquo;s ethnic origin won&rsquo;t always work on people of mixed race. Other times, the conclusion can be ambiguous or unhelpful. &#8220;What does it mean to say that the DNA belongs to a &#8216;light-skinned black man&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a subjective interpretation,&#8221; says Pamela Sankar, who is teaches bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and has a National Institutes of Health grant to study societal implications of the new technology.</p>
<p>Worried about the ethical and social challenges, Germany doesn&rsquo;t permit the forensic use of DNA to infer ethnicity or physical traits. Nor do a handful of U.S. states, including Indiana, Wyoming and Rhode Island. The U.K. and the Netherlands allow it.</p>
<p>DNA-based racial profiling &#8220;has to be used carefully,&#8221; especially in a diverse country like America, says Bert-Jaap Koops of Tilburg University in the Netherlands, who has studied the regulatory picture in different countries. &#8220;Some people could make connections between race, crime and genetic disposition&#8221; and thereby encourage stigmatization.</p>
<p>But scientists are working to overcome the deficiencies and say that more precise DNA tests for ethnicity and several physical traits are on the horizon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Such studies bolster the case for devising a reliable DNA-based test for some physical characteristics. A person&rsquo;s hair color or skin tone can be relatively easy to predict because the identified genes have a fairly strong effect on the trait. However, it isn&rsquo;t quite so easy to make a useful prediction about traits such as height or body mass index. That&rsquo;s because many more genes are likely involved, with each making only a small contribution to the overall effect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Similarly, height is a physical trait that&rsquo;s at least 80% heritable, yet no one has managed to develop a DNA-based test for it. A single gene has been associated with left- or right-handedness. But unlike many genes, examining this one in an adult can&rsquo;t help solve the lefty-righty question.</p>
<p>Mark Shriver, an anthropologist and geneticist at Pennsylvania State University, has also set himself a daunting challenge: Trying to construct a &#8220;picture&#8221; of a person&rsquo;s face by analyzing DNA. He calls the technique &#8220;forensic molecular photo fitting,&#8221; and it is supported by a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prof. Shriver focused on 180 genes that have been previously linked to about 400 craniofacial abnormalities, such as cleft lip. He studied their rate of evolution, figuring that if a gene had led to different physical traits in populations  &mdash;  such as shorter noses in one group, for example  &mdash;  it would have evolved faster than other genes. These genes were likely to have been subject to sexual- or natural selection, and the traits associated with them would have been passed down through the generations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prof. Shriver believes he may need samples from at least 8,000 people, including those from other populations, to develop a practical test for facial structure. He estimates it could cost $10 million and five years to get it done.</p>

			<p>Actually, this is so that black criminals can avoid being identified.  This way, they can continue their black on white crimes.</p>
<p>Heaben forbid that black criminals all go to prison for long terms.  Who would murder, rape and rob whites then?</p>

			<p>Some of the same people who whine on and on about how we need to rely on science when it comes to their ever precious stem cells or the cult of manmade global warming, all of a sudden clam up when it comes to race and science, especially when science proves differences therein.</p>

			<p> Boiled down to its essence, what this article really means is, &#8220;Great advances have been made in identifying crime suspects through DNA, but we&rsquo;re hesitant about using them because they&rsquo;re showing far too many blacks among those suspects.&#8221; Connections between race, crime and genetic disposition encourage &#8220;stigmatization&#8221;? No   &mdash;   those things are &#8220;facts,&#8221; which are often inconvenient things.</p>
<p> The part about the alleged unreliability of eyewitnesses was amusing, too. It reminds me of a line from Chico Marx in a movie once where he was caught in a lie contradicting something a group of people had just witnessed. Chico said, shamelessly, &#8220;Who you gonna believe? Me? Or your lying eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes indeed &#8220;some people&#8221; certainly could, (like the racially aware folks here at AmRen)and those people might spread the truth to their friends and family, and more people would becpme racially aware and less inclined to listen to the poison distilled into their ears by the liberals advocating diversity.</p>

<p>Was the suspect a male or a female?  Who knows?  That would be a subjective interpretation, even if s/he was running around bare naked, right?</p>
<p>Tall or short?  Thin or fat?  Bipedal, or just up on two legs for a temporary change of pace?  Did he commit the crime, or was it all street theatre?  Who knows?  It&rsquo;s all so subjective.</p>
<p>Yep, it&rsquo;s all so subjective from an ivory tower.</p>

			<p>Remember Tony Frudakis? He co-wrote &#8216;Molecular Photofitting&hellip;&rsquo; In 2004 he used his techniques to help convict Baton Rouge serial killer Derek Todd Lee. I&rsquo;ve read a lot about his work, fascinating. OK, DNA profiling may not be perfect (as yet) but it has it&rsquo;s place and is probably more reliable than ten different eye-witness statements.</p>

<p>After which it will be disallowed since it would show blacks in a bad light. Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims OR blacks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not to sure of this, sadly, my wife is NOT receptive to the idea of blacks actually doing so much crime. But of course, she wasn&rsquo;t raised around them and I hope she doesn&rsquo;t learn the hard way.</p>

			<p>When are going to accept the fact that all American blacks are mixed race. 90% of all black Americans have a second cousin who is white. We are the most racially diverse country on the planet.<br>
     This DNA test will prove what we all know that African Americans are the result of the cross breeding of people who were too stupid to avoid black slave catchers in Africa and riff raff who fled the British Islands ahead of the military press gangs and debt prison wardens. Senator Byrd and his senile raving about white n-words was correct. His entire state is made up of white n-words. Go to any prison and cross check the dna of most of the inmates. Whites, blacks and Puerto Ricans will all be related.<br>
     &#8221; The fault Dear Cassuis is not our stars but in our dna that we are underlings.&#8221; No amount of education, counseling, and law enforcement gimmicks will do any good. <br>

			<p>Just do DNA typing of EVERYONE. This should be part of a biometric identity number, along with fingerprints, for everyone on US soil. If we did that, we could fire half of the cops. Most crimes could be quickly and cheaply solved and the perp quickly and cheaply convicted.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular myth,this kind tracking and surveillance would make people MORE secure and MORE free. The biggest threat to the average citizen is to be falsely accused of a crime. This is one of the reason I always use a credit card. I want to be able to prove where I have been at all times.</p>
<p>I would go even further. I would like to see GPS tracking of all vehicles. One of the side benefits of this is we could get rid of most traffic cops, road signs and traffic signals. Traffic information could be projected on your windshield. If you go through a red light, you will be automatically sent a ticket.</p>
<p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but the best way to have fewer laws is to vigorously enforce all laws. The reason the stupid 55mph speed limited lasted so long is that it was not enforced. If it had been, people would have quickly rebelled against it and it would have been changed.</p>
<p>We are in a race between the declining quality of the population and the improving quality of technology. One can substitute for the other, at least for a time.</p>

			<p>Wait a minute!  If race is merely a social construct, how could DNA analysis possibly lead to racial profiling?</p>
<p>It sounds to me like the Bed-Wetting Classes want it both ways.  I am shocked - just shocked - at this apparent hypocrisy on their part.</p>

			<p> When people keep seeing the words &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; they tend to become more politically correct. Is that why everyone is mentioning it?</p>
