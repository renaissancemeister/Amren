<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A father suspected of killing his estranged wife and abducting their two young daughters killed himself on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Brian Patterson, 38, shot himself in a car in front of the girls, Brianna, 4, and Aliyah, 3, in Thornton last night, Aurora police said. He died at a hospital at 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Patterson and the girls were the subject of an Amber Alert after Pamela Patterson&rsquo;s body was found at about 11 a.m. Tuesday in her home on the 17000 block of East Louisiana Avenue in Aurora. She had been shot numerous times.</p>
<p>The girls are safe, Aurora Detective Shannon Lucy said today, and will be placed temporarily &#8220;with safe houses and family members&#8221; under the supervision of social services.</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; mother, Pamela Patterson, filed for divorce from Brian Patterson in January.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brian Patterson&rsquo;s divorce attorney, Wazir-Ali Muhammed, said he visited his client and children Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything seemed great,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were joking and laughing and having a good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muhammed was once married to Patterson&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s been a good man, a good father, a good husband, that&rsquo;s how I would summarize him,&#8221; Muhammed said.</p>
<p>He said the Amber Alert lacked legal merit because Patterson had custody of the girls, which negates an accusation that they were abducted.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a good man, a good father, a good husband, that&rsquo;s how I would summarize him,&rdquo; Muhammed said.</p>
<p>Yes, he was finally starting to get his life together, was planning to be a rap star or maybe a professional basket-ball player, was planning to go back and get his high school degree, blah, blah, blah.  Such a shame, such a shame.  </p>
<p>This is why it is impossible for Africans and Europeans to live together   &mdash;   their minds work differently.  99% of Europeans would say that this man was NOT a good man and definitely NOT a good husband.  Yet 75% of Africans would say that he was a good man and a good husband, and only did what he did because of 300 years of slavery and racism.  It is impossible to maintain a productive society with such childish logic and morality.  Africans and Europeans cannot live together.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m surprised by this.  Not the murder-suicide, but the fact that they were actually married as usually black men just impregnate white females and then leave.  </p>

			<p>Somebody should print up a poster with pictures of O.J. and Nicole, Bobby Cutts and whatever his wife was named, this couple and the numberous others. Underneath the caption should read, &#8220;Interracial Relationships - Easy to get into, murder to get out of.&#8221; And the poster should be distributed to every white junior high girl in the country.</p>

			<p> How about a headline saying, &#8220;Foolish White woman killed by second black husband&#8221;? No, I&rsquo;m not saying &#8220;She got what was coming to her.&#8221; I would not wish murder on anyone. But one wonders, over and over again, what possesses these White women who insist on marrying blacks? Is it White guilt? A juvenile-minded desire to be viewed as &#8220;daring&#8221; and &#8220;edgy&#8221;? A determination to defy parents who are appalled at their choice?</p>
<p> Hey, White ladies who are considering a relationship with a black: They tend to be violent, unpredictable, and with poor impulse control. Plus, miscegenation with them dilutes your own White heritage. Think about it: Is this what you REALLY want?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s very sad when someone believes the best or only way out is to meet their maker.  And, it is also a very selfish act.  Now, there are two more orphans in the world but they&rsquo;ll probably be in a more positive environment being raised by others.  I&rsquo;m sure glad he didn&rsquo;t kill the children because all too often they do.<br>

			<p>This reminds me of the case of the black abusive husband of a white woman and her two mulatto children(one of many cases).He abused her for years, hitting her many times,and she finally separated from him.One time he broke down the door of the place she was living in, grabbed her by the hair, and was dragging her down the street, until he was stopped. Monthes later, she agreed to travel by automobile, along with the two children,to someplace. He asked her to get a bottle of something, she thought it was soda pop.It was a flammable liquid. He soaked her, and the two kids with it, and set all of them on fire. The two kids died a horrible death, and he and her were horribly burned.Why did she trust him? The jury spared him the death penalty. There must have been some blacks on it.She was on the Oprah Winfrey show.</p>

			<p>I am at the point where I see the entire process of miscegenation as rape and as &#8216;Marochinate.&#8221; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marocchinate" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marocchinate</a></p>
<p>It is a downright lie that any white woman would desire such a situation, but the vast majority are lured into it by a combination of coercion, marketing/hypnosis, and brainwashing.It is violence against women no less then mass gang rape.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m surprised when any black man kills himself. The reason is simple. Suicide implies a some sort of feeling of guilt (whether justified or not), or hopelessness. </p>
<p>Since most black men lack a conscience that rules out guilt, and since most of them have everything taken care of them by the state (and they definitely feel no guilt for that) they rarely have the need to feel &#8220;helpless&#8221;, ESPECIALLY lately, like, say, since last November, for example.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m surprised he killed himself.  </p>
<p>Not at all surprised he killed her though.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s WHY most white women hook up with blacks.  If you want them to stop you need to mention the drawbacks of being with one.</p>

			<p>Back before political correctness throttled such research I saw<br>
some material in the Psychology Department archives at UCLA. A couple of grad students set out to investigate white woman/black man couples. They found that over 75% of the women reported that their fathers were racist against blacks. The paper suggested that crossing the race line to antagonize their fathers was the main reason for their race-mixing. Not a good way to start a relationship, eh?</p>

			<p>   Honestly, from looking at the pictures, I really don&rsquo;t see any loss. I feel sorry for the little girls, but the parents are obviously losers. Any white woman that breeds outside her own race is a fool. The children will suffer the consequences of their parents.</p>

			<p>As far as the rebellion angle, the best way to state it to white women is this: we do not need to punish you for an interracial relationship, having a black boyfriend/husband IS the punishment for an interracial relationship - and the penalty is often death.</p>

<p>Yep.  Nine times out of ten, if a black man has a white woman, she&rsquo;s overweight and typically unattractive.</p>
<p>Around here, I&rsquo;ve noticed that these women tend to be trashy and are in need of serious attitude adjustments.</p>
<p>You know, as a white woman, I always took it for granted I&rsquo;d marry white, and I did.  No one had to tell me that black men were off-limits.  It was like an unwritten rule&hellip;and I grew up in a fairly &#8220;progressive&#8221; household in Michigan.</p>

<p>What part of any of that includes killing your estranged wife and then blowing your own brains out in front of your young daughters?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d consider suicide if I was terminally-ill or became blind, but it wouldn&rsquo;t occur to me to kill myself in front of my family or even in a place where they would later find me.</p>
<p>I have to agree with Civilized Neighbor here; a relationship with an African is it&rsquo;s own punishment (their behavior aside, just think about how many of them carry herpes).</p>

Maybe.  But back in that pre-PC time, a good percentage of white people had strong racial feelings ANYWAY, and were not ashamed of them.  So that&rsquo;s not very surprising.</p>
<p>I would suppose it was far more important HOW those women had been treated by their fathers, and WHY they were trying to get back at them with mulatto grandchildren.</p>

<p>Around here, when we see a &#8220;plus-size&#8221; woman with a black man at the grocery store, the woman always pays for everything with a food stamp card. Maybe that has something to do with it.</p>

<p>First, Nicole Simpson, then the woman married to that cop in Ohio, now this. When will some Caucasian women learn that miscegenation is not the way to go? In nature, polar bears do not mate with black bears. </p>

			<p>Why is it everytime some black dies, the black community has to start whining about what a good man he was.  Will blacks ever hold themselves and their fellow blacks to any kind of standard?</p>
<p>I read a recent article in the Atlanta Constitution about a drug dealer that was executed in a robbery.  His neighbor was saying what a good friend and family man he was and how he actually had a job several years ago and was a real hard worker.</p>
<p>I guess in this respect, he was ahead of our president.</p>

<p>Today I saw several more cases like that&hellip; very overweight women with their black boyfriends.  It occured to me that they must have very miserable self-esteem, a very low sense of self-worth, to throw themselves away so cheaply.  Probably they were either abused or ignored as children, so if they were treated like trash they will behave as such. Obviously, they don&rsquo;t hold out for much, and they will fall into the arms of the first man who gives them a second glance. Very few white men would.</p>

<p>Your statement is true to a point.  But I think that a lot of times, heavier women gravitate towards blacks and hispanics because heavier women have lower self-esteems and blacks and hispanics, I don&rsquo;t believe, are as choosy as white men.  I&rsquo;m not trying to make excuses for white women who do this, just that it seems to be the norm.  I&rsquo;ve started noticing a lot more heavier white women with hispanics also.</p>
<p>My daughter babysat several years ago for 3 sisters.  The oldest is now 19 and has been dating black men for about 2 years.  She told my daughter that her black boyfriends said he likes white women because they are cleaner.  Of course, I have issues with the mother of this girl for allowing this to begin with but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>Of course, the bottom line is that women like this, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned are race traitors and blacks want to mutt up the white race anyway.  It&rsquo;s been especially drilled into white girls heads for years now that it&rsquo;s perfectly okay to date outside your race and stupid, white liberal parents have allowed it and then there are stupid white parents who just don&rsquo;t want to be labeled a racist.</p>
<p>When our daughter went to her junior prom, she asked my husband and I what should she do if a black boy asked her to dance.  We told her to tell him no and if he asked why, to tell him that her parents were racists.</p>

			<p>With all the evidence out there that black men are just not into the fidelity thing, it would seem that white girls and women would wise up.  But it seems to be getting worse as we are starting to see more and more of this race mixing.  And unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t just stop with dating, a child or several children always seems to come out of these unions.  And that&rsquo;s the future of this country.  </p>
<p>I always told my children if God wanted us to be the same, we would be all the same.  We are different for a reason, it didn&rsquo;t just happen by chance.  That was the milder version of what my parents told me and my siblings.  My father told us in no uncertain terms, that it was never going to happen in his house and we respected him and our mother enough, that we all abided by their wishes.  I don&rsquo;t believe that any of my sisters or my brother suffered because we listened to our parents in this respect.</p>
