<h1>Death of Two Black Comedy Shows Says More About TV Than Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Deggans, St. Petersburg Times, March 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} With the recent death of CNN&rsquo;s D.L. Hughley Breaks the News and Comedy Central&rsquo;s Chocolate News, does this indicate an unwillingness to laugh at race-based humor in the age of Obama?</p>
<p>Gotta say, doesn&rsquo;t feel that way to me.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m not sure its wise to lump both shows together. Hughley&rsquo;s show died, in part, because it was awful. He&rsquo;s a pretty good comic with some interesting takes on politics and news, but that doesn&rsquo;t add up to the kind of sharp, insightful satire that can regularly power a series like he attempted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The failure of David Alan Grier&rsquo;s Chocolate News is a different story. Here, I think the show failed because it couldn&rsquo;t really find an audience. it wasn&rsquo;t hip enough to draw the young white guys who are Comedy Central&rsquo;s traditional viewers, and it wasn&rsquo;t strong enough with black viewers to overcome that deficit.</p>
<p>The other nail in Chocolate News&rsquo; coffin was the much more popular show which recently filled its timeslot. Important Things with Demetri Martin. The hidden truth about some black-centered comedy shows, is that they succeed by drawing hip, young white people  &mdash;  the force that really made successes of programs by Dave Chapelle and Chris Rock.</p>
<p>But Martin&rsquo;s show has been much more successful in tapping that demographic, so Chocolate News&rsquo; already dim future was snuffed by his strong debut.</p>

			<p>The problem these shows had were the fact that both shows had the word news in them. This alienated just about all blacks from ever watching them.And I think whites are just getting tired of the fact that 99% of most black humor has to do with race. A subject that needs no talent to make jokes about and sound funny.</p>

			<p>You call what D.L. Hughley does comedy?  Remember, that&rsquo;s the show that had Michael Steele on, causing a sub-controversy in the Limbaugh - Steele affair.  I say good riddance.</p>

			<p>Never heard of either one of those shows and I wouldn&rsquo;t watch them anyway. Even so-called black sitcoms in the last 20 or more years are awful and not funny at all. Let blacks watch their own shows and I will watch my own shows.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The hidden truth about some black-centered comedy shows, is that they succeed by drawing hip, young white people &mdash; the force that really made successes of programs by Dave Chapelle and Chris Rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong Comrade Deggans, &#8220;the hidden truth&#8221; about almost all &#8220;black-centered comedy shows,&#8221; is that they stink like a rancid fish that has spent a week in the August sun!</p>
<p>The hate sodden garbage or outright infantile nonsense, that blacks or their media puppet masters see as &#8220;humor,&#8221; is often so base it is only &#8220;funny&#8221; from the most cynical of perspectives. Indeed, as a sociological or &#8220;cultural&#8221; exercise, it has its ironic hilarity, but quickly overtime this does wear rather thin. After all, one can only find the degradation of &#8220;honkies&#8221; or absurd excuses for endemic &#8220;community&#8221; social pathologies amusing for so long; then the reality of things, makes the &#8220;jokes&#8221; more undigestible than ashes and rubbing alcohol in a martini glass straight-up.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>I have briefly seen a couple of these shows.  They come on try to instruct Whites in how Blacks look at them as material they suppose we will laugh at.  I have even seen one show where Chapelle passed his phone number to a guest White opera singer by tricking her into singing something about where he would like to put a finger.  The skit called for her to stuff the note down her bra while trying to look sneaky.  Very funny.</p>
<p>I pass them up every time.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I think early versions of Keith Olbermann&rsquo;s Countdown were a better example of how a news channel could be both informative and funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody that thinks the dullard Olbermann can be &#8220;informative and funny&#8221; would get a big kick out of watching the grocery truck unload.<br/>

			<p>D.L. Hughley Breaks the News seemed like a bad idea from the beginning and what little I saw of it proved my fears to be justified. But Chocolate News was often very funny and did a good job lampooning both blacks and whites. It will be missed. </p>

			<p>Kill your TV.<br/>
Black sitcoms and shows of this type are insipid and unfunny.<br/>
Almost all shows have to promote alleged black culture. Even quote &#8220;White ones&#8221;.<br/>
Divirsity indoctrination is all that is on TV these days.<br/>
Kill your TV</p>

			<p>I would watch a show that made fun of blacks, it would be very refreshing . It would also be good for race relations, I think white people need a safety valve to open . It&rsquo;s because whites are all bunged up with guilt that they can&rsquo;t be honest in a race discussion .</p>
<p>With better race relations we begin the work towards re- segregation, it&rsquo;s best for both whitey and blackey. Liberals could have their own multi-cult community to continue to sink to the lowest depths in, but for the more aware among us &hellip;&hellip;.assimilation is/was and always will be a disaster and that&rsquo;s just an honest race discussion .</p>

			<p>Yea and the radical ignorant Muslim Cassius Clay aka Muhammed Ali who hated the white race used to call even his black opponents as great white hopes, when in fact 99% of the paying crowds who made this idiot millions were white like in all pro sports. Its the same story in everything.</p>

			<p>The only honest black comedy show ever was &#8221; Sanford and Son.&#8221; It almost depicted how much blacks really hate whites and Puerto Ricans.Redd Foxx was a genius. His take on black white interaction was right on. &#8221; When the lights go out, the only thing that matters is who took the last bath.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>Both blacks and &#8220;young, hip, white people&#8221; (aka liberals) loved the Dave Chapelle show. But good comedy always has an element of truth in it. I&rsquo;ve often argued that if the Chapelle show was kept exactly as it was except instead of Dave introducing the skits there was a White guy doing so these same blacks and &#8220;young, hip, white people&#8221; would be screaming &#8220;racism&#8221;!  For example, the skit where Dave asks the question, &#8220;What if blacks were given reparations?&#8221;  The skit goes on to show blacks blowing the money on stupid stuff like buying a truckload of Kools.  It&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s true.  White people just aren&rsquo;t allowed to speak the truth everyone - black and White - deep down knows. </p>

			<p>Per Mad Casper: &#8220;&hellip;Chocolate News was often very funny and did a good job lampooning both blacks and whites. It will be missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok&hellip;how about a show called &#8220;Vanilla News&#8221;&hellip;where they make fun of whites AND blacks. Aint gonna happen. It would be deemed racist. That show was made for one reason and one reason only&hellip;</p>
<p>To degrade whites and make them feel even more guilty and more afaid of blacks. Remember&hellip;we are BEYOND the empowering phase and directly into the &#8220;encouraging&#8221; phase.</p>
<p>Remember who you&rsquo;re dealing with&hellip;Comedy Central&hellip;which is MTV. Which is New York/Hollywood who hate America and are actively in the process of undermining traditional WHITE American culture.</p>
<p>NOT&hellip;something to laugh at. We have at the very least 4 years of this garbage and it&rsquo;s just the beginning. It may seem like something to snicker at, but it&rsquo;s ugly, anti-white propaganda. And it&rsquo;s just getting warmed up. Eventually (hopefully) you&rsquo;ll learn to not &#8220;miss&#8221; this.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&rsquo;ve learned something from this. Please share it!</p>

The Chapelle Show was both funny and eye-opening. Here was a black man showing blacks as they really are; aka, stereotypes.</p>
<p>Dave Chapelles&rsquo; writing partner for the Chapelle Show (and stand-up) was a guy by the name of Neal Brennan. Neal is white.</p>
<p>Chapelle was offered 50 million for a 3rd season but Chapelle had an epiphany about what his show was doing; as I said, he realized that he was showing blacks as the stereotypes they are. Today, lots of white kids are laughing at black stereotypes but blacks are now powerless to stop them because they supported Chapelle while he was doing his show and they can&rsquo;t turn around and say those skits are racist.</p>
<p>After Chapelle turned down the money, their partnership and friendship ended. They are no longer on speaking terms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered who was writing what. Who was the driving force behind this stereotype honesty?</p>
<p>I believe Dave Chapelle is very torn by the work he produced. On one hand, it was funny, he was good at it, and it made him a lot of money. On the other hand, there are now a lot of images of blacks behaving like blacks that whites now defer to in their approach to laughing at blacks. By quoting a Chapelle character, they can freely use racial slurs. </p>

			<p>I personally am sick and tired of seeing more and more black commercials on FOX; never mind the more liberal stations like CNN!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how blacks just make up 13 percent of our population but since the dawning of Obama, seem to hog 90 percent of TV viewing&hellip;  </p>
<p>And how about all of those &#8220;black and white&#8221; couple commercials pushing diversity to the extreme as if it&rsquo;s as natural as night and day&hellip;</p>

			<p>Writer Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times has mixed issues, deliberately baiting his article with a racist tint - a tactic which always draws more readers than the plain boring truth.</p>
<p>The plain boring truth is that these &#8220;black&#8221; shows simply failed to draw enough viewers. In television, race is irrelevant - except as a contoversial come-on - only ratings and revenue matters.<br/>

<p>Agreed. </p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to know is this:  How can I get BET and other non-White ethnic/race-based channels that I find offensive off my cable line-up?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It&rsquo;s because whites are all bunged up with guilt that they can&rsquo;t be honest in a race discussion..&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark:</p>
<p>I am very well versed on the differences between blacks and Whites-especially when it comes to educational ability and IQ.</p>
<p>What do you think would happen to me if I got up at the next teachers&rsquo; meeting and gave a power-point presentation, using  Ruston, Lynn, and Murray&rsquo;s decades-long research and conclusions that blacks on average have IQs of 85, Whites, 100, Asians 107, Ashkenazic Jews, 117  &mdash;  to challenge the current educational dogma that &#8216;race is a social construct?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could present strong evidence that &#8216;students&rsquo; with double-digit IQs will never be brain surgeons or nuclear physicists (as they&rsquo;re repeatedly told now) and will only, ever, learn to read and compute at a rudimentary level and that precious educational dollars are wasted on trying to &#8216;raise them up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Believe me, I feel no &#8216;guilt&rsquo; about these things  &mdash;  but I know that to mention them openly, anywhere, these days, would put my career, my reputation, and my family at grave risk. </p>
<p>Whites, by government force, have been stifled into silence.</p>
<p>George Orwell wrote:  &#8220;During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would say these days for a White to tell the truth about race is an act of suicide  &mdash;  career or otherwise.</p>

			<p>My television viewing has dwindled to almost nothing.</p>
<p>First, the amount of advertising time per hour has become astronomical.  And now the advertising contains more and more blacks.</p>
<p>Second, the amount of blacks on regular programing, news, sports, etc is increasing more than I can stand.</p>
<p>Unless there will be some white channels soon, I can see myself not to even subscribe to cable. </p>

			<p>The &#8216;blackification&rsquo; of America is nearly complete. Although blacks comprise 13% of the population, (with many of that number on prison) they are over represented in sports, TV commercials, ads and programming.  The absence of a few shows won&rsquo;t make much difference. </p>

			<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve had more than enough of racial humour back when Keenan Ivory Wayans hosted a late night talk show, in the nineties. His show was waaayyy overrated, and it seemed like he was trying to out-Arsenio Arsenio Hall! Really!</p>
<p>If only a white guy could host a funny, hip talk show with one tenth the racial content that&rsquo;s tolerated when it,s a black person that,s hosting a tv show&hellip;</p>

			<p>If you want to know about the core of the Black hate-movement, read Manning Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;Color, Communism, &amp; Common-Sense&#8221; (1958).<br/>
He was a Black man (formerly of the Communist Party), who had a change of conscience &amp; defected soon afterward.</p>

<p>Why would you need to &#8216;tell the truth&rsquo; about someone else? Doesn&rsquo;t it almost empower that person all the more to be fixated on them? If you think whites are so smart or magical or have done such a good job with their societies, say that. <br/>
