			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Roodt, Praag, March 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South Africa is headed for another racial census, a.k.a. an &#8220;election&#8221; on 22 April  &mdash;  with the predictable outcome of returning another ANC government to power. Given that South African blacks represent 80% of the population, there is absolutely no way in which the ANC could lose.</p>
<p>Instead of dissipating over time amid the constant din of South African liberals who believe that the country has &#8220;finally transcended race&#8221; or is on its way to doing so, race and identity remain at the core of South African politics. No less a man than Harvard political scientist Samual Huntington once observed that South Africa was one of those countries condemned to a &#8220;conflict of civilizations&#8221;, with a formerly white-dominated Western country currently being Africanised by the demographically dominant black population and its Afrocentric leadership.</p>
<p>In fact, I was one of the few whites attending the infamous Durban &#8220;World Conference Against Racism&#8221; where I actually bumped into our current caretaker president, Kgalema Motlanthe, who is keeping the seat warm for the affable Zulu named Jacob Zuma. During our conversation Motlanthe confessed to his penchant for the book that defined Afrocentrism, Martin Bernal&rsquo;s Black Athena.</p>
<p>South Africa is today an insane society, modelled upon an Ayn Rand nightmare where the looters govern and the producers, entrepreneurs and taxpayers are constantly harassed for handing over more of their wealth. Out of a total population of 46 million people, 12 million South Africans now receive so-called government &#8220;grants&#8221;. They and their dependents  &mdash;  who amount to probably more than 20 million people or half the population  &mdash;  survive on these government handouts. They do not work, yet receive childcare allowances, pensions, free housing, water, electricity, healthcare and schooling.</p>
<p>Together with the former East-Germany, South Africa must be counted among the most successful communist societies of all time where the nineteenth-century socialist dictum, &#8220;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&#8221;, has become the evangelical raison d&rsquo;être of a whole society.</p>
<p>The so-called black middle class consists of government employees, municipal politicians and recipients of racial preference programmes going under bizarre Orwellian names such as &#8220;BEE&#8221;, pronounced like the name of the insect and denoting &#8220;Black Economic Empowerment,&#8221; as well as &#8220;Equity&#8221;, meaning precisely that blacks &#8220;are more equal&#8221; than whites. South African blacks enjoy a standard of living unprecendented among their brothers on the African continent. These &#8220;black diamonds&#8221; as they have been dubbed by advertising agencies, see themselves as a kind of aristocracy or a jetset, economically far removed from their kin living in typical and hardly disguised African squalor and legally superior to South African whites who have been reduced to second-class, exploited citizens. Many educated whites are now either unemployed or work for half the wage earned by the lowest type of black manual worker in the formal sector.</p>
<p>On planet South Africa, where every job in a corporation or in government is subject to carefully monitored racial quotas, only an alien could believe that &#8220;race does not matter&#8221; and that we are sliding on our merry way to a common future as a united nation. The leader of the liberal white opposition party, Helen Zille, is such an alien, even apart from her Botox injections and heavy make-up, giving her the appearance of an ageless, emotionless android. The 58-year old liberal, who is married to a Marxist academic, has doggedly but vainly courted black support for her party, the Democratic Alliance.</p>
<p>In fact, 75% of the DA&rsquo;s voters are white, and two thirds of those are Afrikaners. So at least 50% of the DA&rsquo;s vote comes from Afrikaners, yet nowhere in the party&rsquo;s statements or manifestoes is this fact ever mentioned. Its election slogan is: &#8220;one nation, one future&#8221;, meaning that the diverse races and cultures inhabiting South Africa should merge to form a single, integrated multicultural nation.</p>
<p>The only party contesting the election that could remotely be considered conservative, is the Freedom Front Plus under Dr. Pieter Mulder. Officially the party is in favour of self-determination and an Afrikaner state. Yet since the party&rsquo;s formation in the early nineties, its founding principle has increasingly been pushed to the back burner. Mulder enjoys sparse support and has only four Members of Parliament, as opposed to the DA&rsquo;s fifty. For this election, Mulder has positioned himself as a &#8220;possible coalition partner&#8221; of the liberal DA which, of course, does not countenance the idea of Afrikaner self-determination.</p>
<p>South Africa has gone through so many revolutions in so many areas that one can hardly keep count anymore. So it is easy to forget about the political revolution that has taken place over the last twenty years. The country has always been out of sync with Europe. When Europe swung to the left in the sixties and seventies, South Africa was ruled by the conservative National Party with black allies in the form of the homeland governments and other traditionalist black groups. At the time, the South African left was divided between an internal and an external wing, as well as communists and liberals who hated each other&rsquo;s guts. Its only real support was abroad, especially in Britain where many exiled South African communists like Joe Slovo or ultra-liberals like Donald Woods lived.</p>
<p>After De Klerk&rsquo;s surrender to the ANC in 1994, the left has staged an astonishing comeback and has almost completely displaced conservatives from the political stage. Apart from the Freedom Front Plus whose overall support among the total population amounts to less than one percent, there is no other party that could remotely be considered right-wing, nationalist or conservative. The Conservative Party itself, which broke away from the National Party when it had become evident that the latter was intent on abandoning the white cause in South Africa, has been disbanded and merged with the Freedom Front Plus.</p>
<p>As in the former Eastern Europe under communist rule, the very notion of conservatism or &#8220;being right-wing&#8221; is frowned upon in South Africa today. Almost all the media regularly try to sniff out remaining members of the &#8220;right-wing&#8221; who are generally considered to be a threat to society.</p>
<p>After its conference in Pietersburg in December 2007, the ANC split due the power struggle between Thabo Mbeki and his challenger, Jacob Zuma. The Zuma faction had won at the conference and subsequently &#8220;recalled&#8221; Mbeki from the presidency. Members of the Mbeki faction, led by the former minister of defence, Mosiuoa Lekota and a provincial premier, Sam Shilowa,  have formed their own party, the Congress of the People or COPE, and are considered a mild threat to the ANC.</p>
<p>However, with dwindling corporate and foreign support for the ANC  &mdash;  in the early nineties, the US, Britain and Sweden poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the party to make sure it won the 1994 election, thereby cementing black rule  &mdash;  the ANC has increasingly turned to the state&rsquo;s coffers to fund itself. Even apart from the massive amounts of money voted by parliament to fund political parties on a pro rata basis,  &mdash;  meaning the ANC gets the lion&rsquo;s share  &mdash;  it has made money out of so-called black-empowerment deals whereby white-owned businesses transfer assets to ANC-aligned black businessmen, many of them former terrorists. So any new party finds itself dependent on public donations for funding, against the incumbents who are lavishly funded by the state. If only for this reason, COPE will fail in its attempts to make inroads into the ANC&rsquo;s support among South Africa&rsquo;s black masses.</p>
<p>The outcome of our upcoming racial census is therefore a foregone conclusion. The dilemma for the white or Afrikaner voter who has been brainwashed for fifteen years into thinking that he has no role in politics due to the colour of his skin and his demographic weakness, is heartbreaking to behold. There are some who believe that Mrs. Zille&rsquo;s party will miraculously gain black support and so tame the ANC demon whose prominent and radical youth leader, Julius Malema, has recently been making ominous Mugabe-like noises. In a recent speech, he dismissed the liberal Helen Zille who would rather perform African dances with ANC voters than shake the hands of members of her own electorate as a &#8220;racist&#8221;. Of course, he was loudly applauded by the assembled crowd of black voters to whom any white, even Zille who takes pride in having been an anti-apartheid activist and former member of the Black Sash, is by definition a &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>The South African system, which transferred all power into the hands of blacks, was foisted on the country by the major Western powers and is not working. Health services and rural municipalities have already collapsed. After the recent electricity shortages, water has now become a major issue with raw sewage being released into rivers and streams. When the lights go out, one can still light a candle but if the water in your tap is not drinkable, you have a problem. The sale of bottled water in South Africa is rising steadily and entrepreneurs are selling all sorts of expensive gadgets for purifying tap water.</p>
<p>After Zimbabwe, there is no long-term future for whites in Southern Africa anymore. At best they will be tolerated and discriminated against, at worst they will be driven out or even massacred. The other day two black assailants tied a white man in Rustenburg to his car mirror, poured petrol over him and set him alight. He died in hospital of 100% burn wounds.</p>
<p>These incidents that have become part of everyday news in South Africa show the underlying hatred that many blacks harbour toward whites, just like in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The only long-term solution for the Afrikaners of South Africa is to claim their own territory and set up their fourth republic there. Due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation, South Africa has become virtually empty except for millions of people clustering around a few big cities. Afrikaners could therefore claim large tracts of South African land for a a state of their own where they could easily form a racial and cultural majority.</p>
<p>As in many ethnically divided societies, elections in South Africa merely serve to confirm a pre-existing demographic relationship of majority over minority.</p>
<p>If one includes Namibia, which was part of our country for almost as long as South Africa has itself existed since 1910, it already contains four states: Namibia, South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Ideally, South Africa should be further divided into seven or eight states that might form a confederation that could easily include Botswana and Zimbawe. After all, half the citizens of Zimbabwe are already living in the current Republic of South Africa, having fled the chaos up north.</p>
<p>The Freedom Front Plus is the only party that deserves to be taken seriously, for it has a solution to most of the dilemmas facing our subcontinent, as well as ensuring long-term Afrikaner survival.</p>
<p>Perhaps for that very reason, few whites will support it in this election, for they are voting neither with their hearts nor with their heads but in order to please the foreign whites who got them into this mess in the first place.</p>
<p>However, sooner or later the reality of the situation must dawn upon them. Let&rsquo;s hope it is not too late by then.<br>

			<p>Whites in all Western countries face a South African future if they allow themselves to become a minority.  How do we wake whites up to such a future?  Most whites, I believe, blithely imagine that becoming a minority will make no substantial difference in their existence.  After all, race doesn&rsquo;t exist and all people are the same, or so the propaganda goes.    </p>

			<p>People are always complaining about the ANC.  There is every reason to believe (just listen intently to what liberals say) that the ANC would be a world class government if only the country wasn&rsquo;t crippled by years of white racism and current, on-going, institutional racism.  Shouldn&rsquo;t South African whites be paying additional fees and penalties as a tax against past racism?</p>

			<p>When Protestant Europeans left to colonize other places, they basically had two choices&hellip;..North America or South Africa. Both migrations were difficult but successful. In the case of North America, the whites prevailed over the natives essentially by killing them off. In South Africa, Christian missionaries and Calvinist peaceniks combined with greedy businessmen to seduce the native inhabitants without the great loss of live experienced in North America. Yes, there were wars but they were relatively short and the whites always allowed the natives to make peace anytime the war went badly for them. There were no wars of extermination in South Africa, like there were in North America. Farms and businessmen liked having cheap labor and so the relationship persisted. In North America, the natives were never a source of cheap labor for farms or industry.</p>
<p>Now centuries later, the white South Africans are able to see the ultimate result of policies that ignored demographic realities. Now they are vastly outnumbered in the only democracy in Africa. Now they fall in exactly the same way as the former Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Now they are unwelcome guests in their own country, stripped of rights they have known for centuries, and robbed of property built by many generations. They stand on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope a few of my fellow Americans will see the truth of demographic reality. I also hope it will stiffen their necks to the invasion from Mexico and Latin America.</p>
<p>Not one inch&hellip;.Not one fistful of dirt&hellip;.will we surrender.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately this article will not make one iota of difference to the catastrophe that is South Africa.</p>
<p>A hardworking race of people being systematically wiped off the face of a Country that once had an infrastructure comparable to the best the First World had on offer! Beautiful white children being murdered and raped daily, old people being viciously assaulted, working health, education, transport, electricity systems ruined by the ANC!</p>
<p>&hellip; and in another 20 years or so, someone will dig these articles up from the archives, and realise that it is too late to save a once wonderful Country. South Africa will just be another disease filled wasteland, where filthy, starving, snot-nosed children play in dusty streets. </p>
<p>The fat and useless leaders will then as expected, stand arrogantly before Western governments, begging relief from the poverty and suffering (only to line their own pockets with the spoils).</p>
<p>..And South Africa will be just another African Country!</p>

			<p>I agree with all of Dr. Roodt&rsquo;s statements except one which I will get to later, For comparison reasons the VF+ can probably be seen as a white nationalist political party by outsiders, one must bear in mind that the Afrikaner is a indigenousness nation although they are white and as such has minority rights which the VF+ is trying to claim for us.  I have always been wary of the term &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; the term should be wasp nationalist ( in America that is), the term nation has been raped so thoroughly in the English language it has lost its original meaning. If I ask for example what is your nationality I ask what country you are from and not to which nation you belong to, almost all American diplomats get it wrong, the last one that left South Africa said you have a wonderful nation, what he meant was country we have many nations here, one of which is white.</p>
<p>To explain my point on a web-blog a liberal white South-African now basking in the sun of his new found liberalism asked a question to a African-American &#8220;What makes you African mother&hellip;&hellip;&#8221; obviously using such language to get a response from the appropriate group. One African-American lady answers him correctly a) we have a shared manner of speaking, b) shared culture and c) shared heritage. She is correct it is what makes a volk/nation, the catch is however there are not hundreds of thousands of white African-Americans, are there??   </p>
<p>The VF+ do still support Orania and Afrikaner self-determination, many Afrikaners are voting DA merely to form a bigger opposition to the ANC, with the appearance of the COPE party the Afrikaner voters will start to come home to the VF+ perhaps not completely in this April elections but definitely in the elections there after.</p>
<p>To further my explanation of &#8220;volk&#8221; the word exist in most languages except English, the word is translated into English from other languages depending on Americas relation to said volk, for example in Europe &#8220;Nazi extremist&#8221; in Africa &#8220;tribal tension&#8221; in the east, well that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t trust all CNN&rsquo;s Muslim extremist theories. When America likes you, you are: &#8220;a people&#8221; or a &#8220;nation&#8221; but otherwise you are a Nazi. Any volk can accept a limited amount of integration/outergration as long as it does not change the core (Note 1), the name WASP for a volk is extraordinary because in the absence of the word volk they gave themselves a name that contains each of the identity points that make up a volk. A) Race B) Language C) Culture D) Religion</p>
<p>With the white nations world wide giving up there very existence, not trough marginal integration but large scale displacement, white nationalism no longer seems strange to me. I now would like to point out where I differ from Dr. Roodt because the point has a direct impact on America&rsquo;s future   &mdash;    &mdash;   </p>
<p>&#8220;Many educated whites are now either unemployed or work for half the wage earned by the lowest type of black manual worker in the formal sector.&#8221; <br>
I understand the need for balance in the propaganda wars but the truth is the actual figure is more realistically put at an increase of 200% in white poverty again bearing in mind that there where not that many poor whites to begin with many other whites has simply enriched themselves greatly in the private sector. One of the main reasons Afrikaners never flooded a project like Orania is simply that they have been dependent on cheap black labor for the better part of a 130 years. The continued slow economic retraction of Afrikaners although painful, is exactly what is needed to perform our own labor in an own territory. This economic retraction is made possible only with affirmative action which benefits the 92% black majority.</p>
<p>There was once a debate between Mr. Taylor and Steve Sailer on White Nationalism VS Citizen-ism and Mr. Taylor was right of course the reason being even without large scale immigration to the US. The difference in ability between different races/nations if they are vast mean that the WASP nation will become enriched economically (liberals may want to scream we are right) but alas they will demographically deteriorate even quicker and become unable to perform there own manual labor. History has tout us that it is not moral rights or historical rights nor is it property rights or the perceived infinity of a state&rsquo;s existence that insures the existence of a volk but rather territorial demographic possession, demographics and demographics alone determine the fate of volke/nations, all else is dust in the wind.</p>
<p>Note 1 : Obama and Tiger Woods are both multi racial the one marries into the African-American volk the other into the WASP volk after 7 generation you have nothing but a perfect WASP and a perfect African-American, the core racial composition of the two nations have not changed. This rule only stands with limited Outegration and Integration in large numbers both groups will reject it as a threat to existence, hence a lot of Honor killings (not all though) in the east is performed when a person steps over the ethnic line ( religion/race/language/culture), to small volke/nations without countries outegration is a use threat.</p>

<p>How can we lobby to have African whites offered citizenship in the US &amp; Europe?</p>
<p>I hope whites from SA &amp; Zimbabwe come to the US &amp; western Europe &amp; share their experiences: it could wake some people up from their PC daydreams.</p>

			<p>I visted Africa once, and out of all the nations I visted the most racist one I visted was SOUTH AFRICA. Racism was so thick in the air I could cut it with a knife. Those people can barely raise a farm let alone maintain one. These people run around deficating in the street (women too) and are more focused on renaming white owned building with black african names (which will drive away tourist) than crime,desease, and starvation. The more I hear from that part of the world the more angry I get. These people need to do for their own. They will begging for white nations give them aid and money both of which will go to the personal usage of the fat black politicians. Now they are going to elect Jacob Zuma (a rapist who cant controll his sexual behavior) who thinks aids can be prevented through a shower. That&rsquo;s the future of SOUTH AFRICA. </p>
<p>Like most African countries SA had every oppurtunity to build or maintain a first world nation and failed utterly. Everytime I read articles from this site the more RIGHT WING I become.</p>

			<p>The Whites in South Africa should have just partitioned a corner of the country for themselves and left the rest of South Africa for the blacks to run into the ground.</p>

			<p>This matter is not as cut-and-dried as many believe. Yes, Blacks form the vast majority of South Africa, but they are a divided majority. Tribal loyalty, not democratic principle, holds sway in South Africa, as it does all through the continent. The ANC are simply the dominant tribe, under which the others chafe - Whites most certainly included.</p>
<p>As conditions worsen across the board - Mr. Roodt touched on these trends but overlooked perhaps the most critical; the rising cost and falling supply of food - it becomes inevitable that simmering tribal tensions will erupt into open conflict over basic resources.</p>
<p>Already we hear of the ANC Youth League setting up paramilitary training camps in the bush, and acrimonious exchanges between the chieftains and sub-chieftains of the largest Black parties: the ANC, IFP and COPE. </p>
<p>In one memorable exchange, the South African version of Donald Trump, billionaire tycoon Tokyo Sexwale, accused COPE members of &#8220;practising witchcraft.&#8221; That&rsquo;s what amounts to political mudslinging in Africa, where surely literal mudslinging is not far off - but I digress.</p>
<p>Rising unemployment, collapsing infrastructure and political extremism combine to form the perfect revolutionary cocktail - and this is as true in South Africa as elsewhere&hellip; It only remains for Whites to organise so as to best take advantage of the fast-approaching chaos. Mr. Roodt might take the opportunity to bolster the Afrikaner volk-staat of Orania, or seek a larger one. </p>
<p>Personally, I like the Western and Northern Cape as the new homeland of minority South Africans. To that end, the secessionary Cape Party has recently been formed to contest the upcoming election. </p>
<p>As the demographics of these Cape regions are majority non-Black and culturally / linguistically European-derived to the tune of some 80%, secession is a viable option under both the South African Constitution and the relevant UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. Of course, political means are not the only ones at our disposal.</p>
<p>During the accelerating process of South Africa&rsquo;s decline, a  window period in which everything is up for grabs will present. Within this critical period, the liberation of our people becomes a possibility - and the only one which ensures long-term survival in Africa. For many of us, there&rsquo;s nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>
<p>And yes, there is much still to be done in terms of redefining our ingroup - to exclude die-soft race-recanters naturally. To a large extent though, the rampant crime, economic exploitation, and catastrophic misrule of Blacks, already compells White awakening and cooperation. </p>
