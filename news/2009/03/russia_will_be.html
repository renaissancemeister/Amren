<h1><a href="https://www.ashleymote.co.uk/?p=1153_">Russia Will Be a Muslim Country</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ashley Mote, ashleymote.co.uk, February 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Finnish national newspaper quotes a report from the Ministry of Defence in Helsinki, saying the profound demographic changes since the fall of the Soviet Union are having an increasing  influence on Russia&rsquo;s domestic and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Author Eeva Nikkilä-Kiipula, quotes a government report in the newspaper Aamulehti which claims Muslims are seriously changing the essential character of the Russian population.   According to a report, these changes already represent a serious challenge to Russian internal stability and domestic policy.</p>
<p>The last 20 years have seen important demographic changes in Russia.  At the beginning of the 1990s, 149 million Russians lived in the country.  By 2007 the total was seven million less.   Numbers are diminishing by approximately 400,000 per year.</p>
<p>The situation is completely different in areas with a Muslim majority.  There the population is growing.  Average life-expectancy is considerably higher than in traditional Russian areas.   If demographic growth continues in the same way, by 2015 the majority of Russian army conscripts will be Muslims.  Five years later 20% of all Russians will be Muslims.   By mid-century, a majority of the Russian population will be Muslim.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the self-confidence and identity of Russia&rsquo;s 20 million Muslims has risen dramatically.  In 1991 there were 300 mosques in the country.  By 2007 there were over 8000.  Most new mosques were built with foreign money, mainly from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey.</p>
<p>The 60 Islamic schools in Russia today educate approximately 50,000 pupils. There was not one Islamic school in 1991.</p>
<p>The areas heavily populated with Muslims include Volga-Ural, Baskaroshtan, Tatarstan, North-Caucasus, and the Carelian republic, where three percent of the population are Muslim  &mdash;  20,000 in all.  The impact of Muslims on Russian internal and foreign policy has been clear for some time, and is growing.    Russia is already an observer-member in the Organization of Muslim Countries (OIC).</p>
<p>Footnote:  Finland itself, and Helsinki in particular, has been having difficulties with its own immigrant Muslim population in recent years, with indigenous unrest and civil disturbances.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Muslims will be the majority in Russia by 2050.&#8221;</p>
<p>I laying ten to one odds they won&rsquo;t be.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a good chance the Muslim population will be reduced significantly from today&rsquo;s population number.</p>
<p>How many do they figure will survive Russia&rsquo;s civil upheaval, breaking along lines of ethnicity and religion? </p>
<p>These trends analysts would be better off if they hang on to their day jobs, because they&rsquo;re going to need them.</p>

			<p>This is true, Muslims unlike Russians do NOT abuse alcohol and therefore tend to be better husbands (in the plural sense)so many ethnic Russian women go to them as well, this is one of the reasons why people (mainly men) die young in Russia.</p>

<p><br>
Isn&rsquo;t it odd that the racial timeline or countdown for all of our Western countries is remarkably similar?  By mid-century, whites will be a minority in all major once-white countries. And by the end of this century, we will be little more than a weak and vanishing memory and all but gone from our homelands.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t it odd too, that the opening of the 20th century saw us numerous, powerful, and in uncontested control of the world  &mdash;  -while by the end of the same century we were confronted with arrogant challenges and demands everywhere, with outselves supinely backing down before them, and facing predictions of our imminent demise?</p>

			<p>White Russians can&rsquo;t complain - the Muslims we are talking about are not recent migrants - they have lived in the lands they now occupy for centuries and in most cases were forcibly incorporated into Tsarist Russia and later the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So this is not an immigration issue in the way Hispanic influx into the US, or Muslim influx into the UK is.</p>

			<p>Which European country will be the first to expel their Moslems?  I can&rsquo;t believe that Russia will not put a stop to Moslem expansion before it gets out of hand.  If they could summon the will to liquidate the Kulaks, how could they not have the strength to de-Islamify their country?</p>

<p>Populations in what is Russia have come and gone over the centuries. There is plenty of land in Siberia. Stalin knew how to use it. Stalin is a hero to most Russians. If the muslims assimilate, fine. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to rule Mother Russia.</p>

			<p>If Russia turns majority non-white at the same time as the US and Europe, it will be clear that whatever political or religious model your country has, the result is always the same.  There must be a stronger force that overrides all other variations forcing us to heterogeneity.  Economics is one worldwide shared variable.  Technology is another.  Women&rsquo;s Lib is a third.  Perhaps we should look more closely into those areas to explain our decline, than the common bogeymen of politics and religion.</p>

			<p>These &#8220;Muslims&#8221; are still white and, many times, indistinguishable from other Europeans and Caucasian Middle-Easterners. Russia may begin to have a Muslim majority, but it will remain white. </p>

			<p>One should not that there are millions of ethnic Russians in Central Asian lands. For instance 25percent of Kazahkstan are ethnic Russians. So in this case it is not all one way.</p>
<p><i>There is plenty of land in Siberia. Stalin knew how to use it. Stalin is a hero to most Russians. If the muslims assimilate, fine.</i> communists have always found Muslims problematic. Not so fascists and Nazis who utilized Muslim collaborators in WWII - hence Stalin&rsquo;s mass deportation of Chechens and other groups.</p>
<p>But I agree - Stalin was a great man. Both an internationalist and a patriot.</p>

<p>There are two different problems: low birthrates and immigration.  Women&rsquo;s Lib, technology, and economics contribute to low birthrates.</p>
<p>The example of Russia confuses the issue because the Muslims were there already and are not arriving as a result of immigration.</p>
<p>The causes behind low birthrates and liberal immigration policies overlap, but are not identical.  What I am getting at here is that it is white guilt that is the number-one root cause of white demographic displacement in most white countries.  Without white guilt we would not have so much non-white immigration.<br>

<p>This statement alone suggests to me that you have never had much to do with muslims or lived in a muslim country. Alcoholism is rampant in those countries, and the muslim men DO NOT TREAT THEIR WOMEN PROPERLY! they are not obliged to in their religion.</p>

			<p>This piece tacitly assumes that Russia is like the USA, a passive and enfeebled democracy willing to let itself be destroyed by hostile internal forces.</p>
<p>Should Muslims become too noisy and demanding we can expect them to be dealt with in much the same manner as Josef Stalin dealt with the hapless kulaks.</p>

I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. Is there such a thing as an assimilated muslim?  Do muslims EVER assimilate?  Show me some.</p>
<p>These muslims, as John Liu said above, are not immigrants; they have lived in Russia for many centuries, even before parts of it were Russia.  They are STILL unassimilated. Why expect something to happen in the 21st century that never happened before?<br>

			<p>  I really doubt that the Russians will accept a Muslim majority. They have proven to be too tough in the past. Russians feel no guilt about oppressing minorities. Perhaps, they will split off Muslim sections of the country by 2050. Most Muslims in Russia are not of the religious variety but more ethnic Muslims. We would consider most to be white with some Central Asians, who look like our Comanche&rsquo;s and Lakota.</p>

I suppose if Russians were stupid enough (like Americans) to allow moslems to vote themselves into power, then this would be a problem.  Russians, instead, have a tradition of cracking the heads of moslems and their satraps when they get out of line. Think back to Afghanistan. The Russians were only doing there what they had been doing since the beginning of the 19th century. Would that we had allowed them to finish the job. There might be two big towers still standing in New York City.</p>

<p>It amazes me the pro-communist sympathies we have on this web site; but this one takes the cake. Well, maybe not. I am reminded of the statement of how Whites should have supported the USSR instead of Blacks in Southern Africa. (The USSR was BIG supporter of Black insurgents in Africa during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.)</p>
<p>Stalin was responsible for killing off huge numbers of Ukrainians in the 1930s. </p>
<p>&#8220;The dreadful famine that engulfed Ukraine, the northern Caucasus, and the lower Volga River area in 1932-1933 was the result of Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s policy of forced collectivization. The heaviest losses occurred in Ukraine, which had been the most productive agricultural area of the Soviet Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The death toll from the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine has been estimated between six million and seven million. According to a Soviet author, &#8220;Before they died, people often lost their senses and ceased to be human beings.&#8221; Yet one of Stalin&rsquo;s lieutenants in Ukraine stated in 1933 that the famine was a great success. It showed the peasants &#8220;who is the master here. It cost millions of lives, but the collective farm system is here to stay.&#8221;.. </p>

(Immivasion   &mdash;   &#8220;Where there are Mexicans there is Mexico.&#8221;) Should we increase our birth rate to match the invaders?</p>

			<p>Western ideals are the cause of western decline. The pursuit of happiness ideal has caused the west to prefer self fulfillment over self sacrifice. The pursuit of happiness in the absence of Christian revelation has led to a culture which is saturated with pornography, a culture which celebrates the  consumption of illicit drugs and a culture in which love of people is replaced with love of things.</p>

			<p>My Grandmother was Chechneyan. She left her home with the clothes on her back and married my Grandfather. (A eastern orthodox christian) My father is a Anglo born and raised in the U.S. Anyway, most Muslims in Russia are without a doubt white by any defenition you want to use. I have relatives who are Muslim that have blonde hair and blue eyes. I know Russians who are eastern orthodox Christians that look turkish. There are many Muslim Russians who are also Russian nationalist. Islam in western Europe generally means non-white Arab, Pakistani, etc. However in Russia Muslim missionaries were converting southern Russians to Islam while Christian missionaries from Spain were trying to convert Aztecs to Catholicism many centuries ago. Trust me, the Muslims in Russia for the most part (Russia is a big country with different ethnicities of Muslims) are not religious at all. In regards to ethnicity, if Russia became a majority Muslim country tomorrow it would still very much be a majority white country. Amreners may not want to hear this. But truth is truth.</p>

Thank you. I totally agree with you about WW 1.  Perhaps it all began (if there is any such thing as a precise beginning that can be pinpointed)  when the great Chancellor Bismarck was dismissed by the new German Kaiser, followed by the dramatic re-alignment of countries in  the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892,  and then the Entente Cordiale of 1904,  which marked the end of British neutrality in Europe and opened the way for war (and subsequent catastrophe).   <a href="/wiki/File_Map_Europe_alliances_1914-en.svg" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_Europe_alliances_1914-en.svg</a></p>
<p>As for the supreme and unassailable position of Europeans in the world at the beginning what should have been a glorious century (prior to the Russian defeat by Japan in 1905), I recall reading some enlightening comments about that by William Bradford Hughie in, <i>&#8220;The Revolt of Mamie Stover&#8221;,</i>a book I read many years ago.  His comments were directed specifically to  the unchallenged supremacy held by the Anglosphere just prior to WW2, and how it had fallen from that pinnacle afterwards (despite its supposed &#8220;victory&#8221; in 1945), never to enjoy the same pre-eminence again.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolt_of_Mamie_Stover_(film)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolt_of_Mamie_Stover_(film)</a></p>
<p>I shall have to try to get the book again.  It was just a paperback, but full of pithy observations about society which  I recall being struck by, even way back then   &mdash;   long before the conditions we see before us today.  Of course, it was  written half a century ago (1951),  describing what was another world   &mdash;   US society at the opening of WW2   &mdash;    and I&rsquo;m sure he could NEVER have imagined the groveling depths to which the Anglosprere (and the entire Eurosphere) has sunken by now!   </p>
<p>To Hughie, an Alabaman (although a liberal), an African-controlled UN and  a half-African President in 2008 would have been beyond imagining.  (Yes, he was a Southern liberal, but I wonder if he would change his views if he could see the astounding results today.  Like so many well-meaning people then, all he wanted was to see the blacks get a little better deal.  He didn&rsquo;t expect to hand them control.)</p>

			<p>White Russians can&rsquo;t complain - the Muslims we are talking about are not recent migrants - they have lived in the lands they now occupy for centuries and in most cases were forcibly incorporated into Tsarist Russia and later the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So this is not an immigration issue in the way Hispanic influx into the US, or Muslim influx into the UK is.</p>
<p>Thanks for your opinion, Mr. Liu.  That and ten bucks will buy you a pizza.</p>
<p>Russians have no right to complain about what their commie overlords (often racial/ethnic aliens, I might add) have done to them.</p>
<p>Gee, you&rsquo;re a real paragon of morality.</p>

<p>Indeed. I find it ironic to find praise of Stalin, whose policies killed millions upon millions of White Eastern Europeans, in an article about Russia&rsquo;s declining population.</p>

<p>More likely the country will break apart and a much smaller rump Russian state will emerge. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Assimilated Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Definition of an Oxymoron.</p>
<p>Unless you mean assimilate to Sharia Law, and a new Caliphate in Europe.<br>
Not in Holy Rus. WIth the rise in WHite birthrates, the growth of the revivified Orthodox Church that even Stalin couldn&rsquo;t destroy, there&rsquo;s more a chance that the USA will succumb before Russia.</p>
<p>oh, wait. It is. REmember who you folks elected in November?</p>

			<p><i>These &ldquo;Muslims&rdquo; are still white and, many times, indistinguishable from other Europeans and Caucasian Middle-Easterners. Russia may begin to have a Muslim majority, but it will remain white.</i></p>
<p>This brings to mind an interesting debate that has occasionally been touched upon on this website: what to think of white Muslims?  It seems to me that those that do exist are almost totally immune to the liberal &#8220;disease&#8221;   &mdash;   Islam seems to inoculate them against it.  </p>
<p>From a religious and cultural standpoint it may be very bad, but from a purely racial standpoint it seems to be quite beneficial: they don&rsquo;t accept the liberal &#8220;isms&#8221;, zealously protect their group interests (often ethnic, not just religious), and have higher birth rates than Christian groups.  So maybe there is a silver lining to this dark cloud.</p>

<p>NO. The SOVIET UNION broke apart. I am talking here about RUSSIA ITSELF. I expect it to shrink dramatically in size. </p>

Not really. Speaking racially, Islam doesn&rsquo;t have to innoculate them against those liberal (racial) &#8220;isms&#8221; because Islam AREADY INCORPORTATES THEM.</i></i></p>
<p>Like Marxism, Islam does not recognize race, but only one big Islamic family   &mdash;    the Umma.  Within that family, racial mixing goes on and is rife. There is no prohibition against it.  Where it hasn&rsquo;t occurred, that is only because of past geographical limitations.  Islam is just as racially &#8220;liberal&#8221; as any Marxist political front. They say, &#8220;There is only one race, the human race.&#8221;  So do Moslems!   That&rsquo;s one of Islam&rsquo;s great attractions for American blacks.  Racially speaking, there is no difference between them. Who needs either one?<br>
