			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nationwide Insurance, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><br>
Columbus, Ohio  &mdash;  African Americans are more optimistic about their financial future over the next year than the general population, but the majority of those responding acknowledge they don&rsquo;t have a financial game plan and many don&rsquo;t know where to start. A new survey of 1,200 participants commissioned by The Smiley Group and Nationwide Insurance shows 58 percent of African Americans expect their household situation to be better a year from now, compared to only 30 percent of the general population sharing similar optimism.</p>
<p>While African Americans say they think their financial situation will improve in the next year, most of those surveyed indicated they are not taking deliberate actions to better their financial circumstances:</p>
<p>* Less than half say they are proactive about their financial future</p>
<p>* 3 in 4 say they do not have a written financial plan</p>
<p>* 1 in 3 say they don&rsquo;t know where to start when it comes to personal financial planning</p>
<p>African Americans are more confident than their general population peers in their ability to make savings and investment decisions (52 percent vs. 43 percent), but are also more likely to indicate they are struggling with credit card debt (38 percent vs. 32 percent).</p>
<p>On saving for college, nearly half of all survey participants with children under 21 said they are very or extremely worried about being able to afford a college education for their children, while only about one in 20 of all survey participants say they actually have a college savings plan. Only 3 percent say saving for education is the most important goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one thing to be positive, but it&rsquo;s another to be practical, proactive and prepared to weather this difficult economic climate,&#8221; said Tavis Smiley. &#8220;This survey reveals the critical need for an honest assessment of our financial status so that we can be sure that we are taking the steps necessary to safeguard the future for ourselves, our families and the next generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also reports that nearly nine out of 10 African Americans acknowledge they do not have a professional financial advisor, because they don&rsquo;t think they need one or think they can&rsquo;t afford one.</p>
<p><b>Hungry for Information</b></p>
<p>African Americans  &mdash;  even though most don&rsquo;t have a formal advisor or plan  &mdash;  responded they had a greater interest than the general population in obtaining financial planning information from seminars, a financial advisor, an insurance agent, family/friends or television.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nationwide shares Tavis Smiley&rsquo;s passion about empowering people with information and resources that can help them plan for a brighter future and protect what matters most to each household,&#8221; said Candice Barnhardt, Nationwide&rsquo;s vice president for Diversity and Inclusion. &#8220;This study is encouraging because it says that, despite the economic downturn, there is a strong desire in many households to seek out advice and information to overcome the immediate financial challenges and plan for long-term dreams like college and retirement.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Can We Talk About Something Else?</b></p>
<p>African Americans aren&rsquo;t alone in their tendency to avoid the topic of finances. Like the general population, they rank sex and not having enough money as the top two topics they are least comfortable discussing with family members, far outranking religion or politics.</p>
<p>African American respondents admitted more frequently to taking some type of action to avoid conversations about finances (45 percent vs. 39 percent of the general population). Generally, of those who are willing to make this admission, actions taken to avoid the conversation included screening calls and cutting off a relationship.</p>
<p><b>Teachable Moment for a Generation</b></p>
<p>Of those who aren&rsquo;t actively avoiding the topic, African Americans reported that they are talking to their children about financial matters. Three out of four parents with children under 21 say they have discussed saving money with their children, and three-fifths have done so within the past month. One out of four have discussed saving money in the past six months. However, of those participants with children in school, eight out of 10 acknowledge they have not researched if their school teaches about saving money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exposing our children and young adults to basic information about finances and personal financial planning will have a profound effect on how the next generation spends, saves and invests,&#8221; said Barnhardt. &#8220;The current economic environment will leave a permanent impression on 17- to 25-year-olds. The Great Depression created a generation of risk-averse spendthrifts. The &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s created a generation of hungry consumers with a high tolerance for risk. The deep downturn we&rsquo;re now in will likely influence not only financial habits, but also the shape of public policy and the types of financial products the market offers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to be a part of the national dialogue about how to get beyond this economic crisis,&#8221; adds Smiley. &#8220;The more we are all empowered with information, tools and resources, the more we all can contribute to making America as good as its promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Results of the national, online survey conducted in January by the Blackstone Group are being released leading up to the 10th Annual State of the Black Union, being held Feb. 28 in Los Angeles. A Web panel was used to collect national data for a total of 1,200 respondents split into two sample groups. General Population, ages 18+ (n=600) and African American, ages 18+ (n=600). The survey has a margin of error of +/- 4 percent.</p>
<p><b>Media Availability:</b></p>
<p>Tavis Smiley will discuss survey findings at press conference on Friday at 11:40 a.m. PST at the Bovard Auditorium at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p>

			<p>Judging from the fact that blacks seem to be disadvantaged compared to whites (as opposed to, say, the NBA or NFL) I&rsquo;m going to have to blame &#8220;<i>white privilege</i>&#8221; on the fact that blacks seem to be less inclined towards saving and other financial areas.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Exposing our children and young adults to basic information about finances and personal financial planning will have a profound effect on how the next generation spends, saves and invests,&rdquo; said Barnhardt. &ldquo;The current economic environment will leave a permanent impression on 17- to 25-year-olds.</i></p>
<p>Really?  How many black 17-year olds have IRAs, 401k or investment portfolios?  There was an Alabama song in the 1980s, &#8220;Song of the South,&#8221; that had this lyric:  &#8220;Somebody told us Wall Street fell, but we were so poor that we couldn&rsquo;t tell.&#8221;  I think that&rsquo;s the way it is with a lot of blacks and today&rsquo;s near-depression.</p>
<p>As for the study&rsquo;s results, we see that blacks are optimistic about their financial future but haven&rsquo;t the foggiest on how to do it.  This mirrors studies about academics:  blacks have the highest self-esteems and therefore think they&rsquo;re doing the best, but actually perform the lowest.</p>

			<p>Why should they be worried about ANY of this. They know that Whitey will pay for anything they want from womb to tomb. Besides, financial planning is a &#8220;White thang&#8221;.</p>

			<p>All black parents teach financial responsibility to their children in the same way that all black children growing up in the hood are going to become millionaire rap stars, basketball players, or doctors.</p>

			<p>I have a friend whose parents barely survived the horrors of WWII. He acquired from his parents a healthy paranoia about banks and stock markets. AS a result, he keeps all his money in low yield FDIC insured bank accounts. I, on the other hand, felt smart about putting all my money into investment accounts and initially saw my investments triple. We have similar salaries.</p>
<p>Result: I&rsquo;ve lost everything I&rsquo;ve saved since 1999. My friend is financially secure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very optimistic about my financial future. But I suppose with Barack Obama in the White House and Robert Reich saying that government stimulus spending should exclusively benefit, blacks have ample reason to be.</p>

			<p>Why in the world would blacks start thinking about their financial future now?  A majority of them must believe that their President is going to provide everything from toilet paper to their mortage payment. They all voted for him. What&rsquo;s to worry about?  Nothing minus nothing is still nothing!!</p>

			<p> Of course blacks are more optimistic about their financial future over the next year. If they have any economic problems,<br>
or no employment for that matter. They can always fall back on the welfare state. Their federally preferred skin color makes<br>
welfare &#8220;entitlements&#8221; a guarentee.</p>

			<p>As a white person, I am pessimistic about my financial future.  While I paid off my mortgage while I could, my 401(k) has lost a third of its value.  I suppose I&rsquo;ll be working until I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
<p>White priviledge?</p>

			<p>Maybe they think Obama will pay their mortgages and buy gas for their cars.</p>
<p>Heh.  If I knew someone was going to pick up the tab, I&rsquo;d be pretty optimistic too&hellip;.</p>

			<p>This is an allied subject.  What do the posters here think of the Obama photo op in Columbus with almost an entire class of white police recruit graduates as benefiting from the stimulus plan.  Do you think this was to throw people off or was it representative?</p>

			<p>Gosh, what a surprise!  Blacks feel good about their financial future.  </p>
<p>With one of their own in the White House, I can understand their optimism, however misplaced it might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;We gonna stick it to Whitey!&#8221; is, sadly, too often the black definition of success and prosperity.</p>

<p>Photo-op.  Those officers funded by stimulus money will only have their jobs for one year, assuming there&rsquo;s not another stimulus or Columbus&rsquo;s economy turns around.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a matter of civil rights   &mdash;   Federally-funded local cops start out with handcuffs on their hands behind their backs, because they&rsquo;re supposed to &#8220;respect&#8221; the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of the black thugs they patrol.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing this since I was a kid. They always think their going to make &#8220;they point&#8221; or that their number is going to come in or they talked to some groomer at the track and there goes the rent money. What did anyone think was going to happen when they their boy in. Ballantine and Colt45 must have had a banner month last November. There&rsquo;s your optimism in a handy 40 ounces.</p>

			<p>One reason blacks feel more financially secure may be that they&rsquo;re more likely to work in the public sector where layoffs are far less likely.</p>
<p>Another reason is that they&rsquo;re more likely to be on public assistance (&#8220;Layoffs, what are those?&#8221;).</p>
