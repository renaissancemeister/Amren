<h1>Most City Workers Are White, Male, Figures Show</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Graff, Winston-Salem Journal, February 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Winston-Salem&rsquo;s city government is overwhelmingly run by men and whites, according to an analysis of December employment figures given to the mayor and the Winston-Salem City Council this week.</p>
<p>The figures show that the almost three-quarters of the city&rsquo;s officials and administrators are men and that nearly two-thirds are white. The people who work in &#8220;protective services&#8221;  &mdash;  police, fire or security  &mdash;  are even more likely to be white and male.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s overall employment roster directly reflects the black population of the city: 34 percent of city employees and 34 percent of city residents are black. The city included data from the U.S. Census Bureau to show how the city&rsquo;s employment roster corresponds to Winston-Salem&rsquo;s demographics.</p>
<p>For instance, less than one-fifth of the people who work in protective services are black, but nearly four-fifths of maintenance employees are black.</p>
<p>Jimmy Boyd, the president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that the numbers are alarming.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The council and mayor received the numbers Thursday as a precursor to data that the city will be required to report to the federal government this fall. The numbers represent a snapshot of employee demographics in December. The numbers that the city will report this fall to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will come from the employment rolls as they stand on June 30.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joines said that the numbers that show a shortage of black police officers are particularly troubling. Nineteen percent of the city&rsquo;s protective-services employees are black. Ninety percent are male.</p>
<p>He said that the city has created programs to recruit black police officers, including one at Winston-Salem State University in which the city pays the tuition of a student who subsequently becomes a Winston-Salem police officer.</p>

		<p>I had a very long rant written about the terrible effects of awarding merit-based jobs to people squarely on the basis of race; it spoke of fire-departments in Chicago, of the never-ending mess Affirmative Action has made of our colleges and universities, of how busing and forced &#8220;desegregation&#8221; have wrecked public schools, and it ended with the degradation of our Armed Forces as they have become infiltrated with immigrant gangs and criminals. </p>
<p>Then, I realised that the only appropriate response to this story, and the hundreds of stories like it, was to quote a fellow AmRen poster, who always closes with the line: &#8220;God help us all.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whatever happened to being the best person for the job? The most qualified? the most deserving? the most suitable? When companies and city agencies are put into a position to choose an employee in order to make the numbers look good, as opposed to actually choosing someone who will be good at the job, it doesn&rsquo;t end well. The NAACP needs to sit down and let the Chief and City Council handle departmental matters.</p>

		<p>This is unusual, because most cities that are 34% black will have City Halls that are almost entirely black, not counting police and fire (which usually have some semblance of standards and thus weed out some blacks).  St. Louis City Hall is all black, not counting the Mayor and the half of the Aldermen that are white, and the city is 54% black.</p>

Well, most people who live in Winston-Salem with post secondary education are white. In fact most people who live in <br>
Winston-Salem are white.</p>

		<p>Blacks like these simply will not be satisfied until every white male is jobless and homeless.  These black agitators do not care that a large number of black males are simply unemployable.  Just once I would like a town or corporation stand up to these pimps. </p>

		<p>There are more white males because this a majority white country.  Duh!  Would you be shocked if you looked at China and say that the police force was almost Chinese men or if the police force in an African country was mostly black men?  Did I miss something?</p>

		<p>This is a good example of what people mean who say the crash just might turn out to be beneficial for whites.</p>
<p>If this economy folds, as forecast, there won&rsquo;t be enough jobs left for the blacks to whine and cry over.</p>
<p>Donations to black groups like the NAACP, the ACLU, the ADL, and the SPLC are all going to plummet, so they&rsquo;re not only going to have to lay off personnel, a couple just might go belly up.</p>
<p>But whatever, they&rsquo;re all going to have less of a voice than what they&rsquo;ve had these past several years of boom times when their donations came in by the wheel barrow full everytime they mentioned the VAST white supremacists who lurk around every tree, just waiting their chance to pull off a hate crime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see all these left wing big shot donors fighting for their bare survival.</p>
<p>And that just might not all they&rsquo;ll be fighting for if it gets as bad as some say it will.</p>

<p>That is oh so true. As someone who went to a black high school and have many black friends I can tell you that a large portion of them drop out of school, dont pay attention, get bad grades, or get a free pass. Image if 50% (A NUMBER PREDICTED TO DROP) of blacks complete high school and the majority of them compete on a middle school level then it would make sense that there wont be to many blacks in high level positions. In no way does that represent all of them but just a large number.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d wager that however badly the Obama administration performs, there will be no criticism from the majority of those who voted for him especially from the &#8220;slobbering&#8221;( thanks Bernie Goldberg) White idiots who voted for him.</p>
<p>The Blacks will criticize him if he doesn&rsquo;t come up with all the goodies plus more that they expect from him.  If he doesn&rsquo;t, the usual suspect race hucksters will be on him and will play on his mixed race; saying that he isn&rsquo;t &#8220;black enough&#8221;. </p>
<p>Separation, separation, separation!!!!!! It&rsquo;s the only solution.<br>
The great American experiment has been a failure.</p>

		<p>There was something similar to this in my town (smaller sized) town in North Carolina. A lady sued saying blacks were underrepresented in city government. It turned out, and the local paper actually printed this, the percentage of blacks employed by the city was almost exactly the same as their percentage of the population. Well, I believe it was a little bit higher. </p>
<p>What these &#8216;facts&rsquo; fail to show, and what blanket income comparisons never show, is that the white population has an average age close to 40 years old and the black population has an average age closer to 25. Older people of all races earn more on average than those who are younger - as would the average age of someone who works for city government be higher, and not a typical 18 year old. </p>

		<p>Ever notice that whenever the MSM gives any detail about the black/white divide that all the &#8220;information&#8221; is from one side of the debate? For instance, this article implies that racism or discrimination is the reason that more blacks are not in positions of power. I wonder what the average black education level is in W-S. Do citizens want educated people to make important municipal decisions?  </p>

		<p>To anonymous&hellip;.I am glad you posted that remark about Pittsburgh&hellip;..they already have TOO MUCH DIVERSITY&hellip;look at the crime rates down that way.  I have a cousin who left that area because of the black crime after he retired. If they want even more diversity, I suggest they visit a city like say, Detroit, it is a dump and was once a triving city.  It used to be clean, now it&rsquo;s dirty and crime runs rampant.  All I have to say is, hey mayor of Pittsburgh, shut the hell up and grow a brain!!</p>

		<p>If the resources of America were not scarce, there would be plenty of jobs to go around to make everyone happy. In fact EVERYONE-such as the immigration enthusiast-knows that the resources of America are in fact scarce..for otherwise, why the need for affirmative action programs in the first place. </p>
<p>In fact, the classic liberal argument for affirmative action-made by Philosopher Juidith Jarvis Thompson-has a premise about resources scarcity&hellip;. leading to justification of discrmination against  Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>And it is also a fact that affirmative action enthusiasts are also open borders- immigration enthusiasts who want to exttend affirmative to hispanics and asians. This  policy  is a blueprint for violent racial conflict within the borders of America. Affirmative action/open border enthusiast must be counting on Native Born Whites not fighting back. They are in for a rude awakening when the GREAT WHITE RACIAL AWAKENING ARRIVES. Liberals and Leftist truely must be psychotic.</p>
<p>There are severe,festering contradictions in America society. It is only a matter time before American society implodes. And when this happens, American society will come to a grinding halt. </p>

		<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realized having educated, competant, white administrators running a city was so frightening.  Since I live in Colorado Springs, should I begin to worry as well?  Would it be less &#8220;alarming&#8221; if Winston-Salem was being run by the same oxygen-wasters who run the city governments of Detroit and Washington DC?</p>

		<p>Come to New York City of see who is working for the City Government: all Blacks and mestizo. Very difficult to find a White person. Blacks, Spanics/Mestizo, and other non-Whites control all the City Departments.<br>
Go in the stores too. All the employees are Black, Spanics/mestizo and third world suckers. What about Doctors offices? The same as above.<br>
There is no effort made by companies or employers to reach Whites. They are not Wanted, plain and simple.</p>
