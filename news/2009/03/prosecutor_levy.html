<h1>Prosecutor: Levy &#8216;Random Victim&rsquo; of Salvadoran Laborer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, March 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly seven years after the remains of federal intern Chandra Levy were found in a Washington park, a jailed laborer from El Salvador faces a murder charge in her death, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>A judge on Tuesday signed an arrest warrant for Ingmar Guandique, 27, who is serving a 10-year sentence for two assaults in Rock Creek Park that occurred around the time of Levy&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Her remains were found in Rock Creek Park about a year after she was reported missing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Levy was a random victim of Guandique, who attacked and killed her as she jogged in Rock Creek Park,&#8221; said Jeffrey Taylor, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Guandique faces a first-degree murder charge. A conviction on the charge would bring a mandatory sentence of 30 to 60 years in prison, Taylor said.</p>
<p>The massive publicity surrounding the Levy case was largely a result of her romantic affair to then-Rep. Gary Condit, a California Democrat. Police questioned Condit many times in connection with the slaying, but the congressman was never considered a suspect. Video Watch the police announce arrest »</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Guandique has been imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution-Victorville, a medium-security facility northeast of Los Angeles, California. Officials hope to transfer him from California to the nation&rsquo;s capital in 45 to 60 days.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s serving his sentence on the two assault convictions in California because there are no prisons in the District of Columbia. Those convicted of federal crimes in the capital are sent to various federal prisons across the country.</p>
<p>Guandique was considered a person of interest in 2002 in connection with Levy&rsquo;s death, authorities said Tuesday. Before the new charges, his projected release date from prison was October 5, 2011.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two other witnesses reported that Guandique told them he committed crimes against women, including rape and murder, according to the affidavit. And another witness last month told police Guandique admitted his involvement in Levy&rsquo;s killing, as well as that he tried to rape two other women in the park at knifepoint, the affidavit said.</p>
<p>When news emerged last month that Guandique&rsquo;s arrest was imminent in the Levy case, the same witness told police Guandique &#8220;became very anxious and said something to the effect of, &#8216;[Expletive], it&rsquo;s over. They got me now. What am I gonna do?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>

			<p>Miss Levy wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;random&#8221; victim.  A white guy didn&rsquo;t kill her.</p>

			<p>I get really mixed results when I look up Gary Condit&rsquo;s immigration record.  That he was not more on our side could be said to have led to the death of his own intern.</p>

			<p>Guandique is an illegal immigrant, and his known victims are all white females.  The media would like it to appear that Guandique&rsquo;s actions are part of America&rsquo;s domestic crime problem rather than the government&rsquo;s (willfull) failure to keep intruders out.  The prior two assault victims were both blonds.  His crimes were anything but random.  White females, particularly blonds, are prey in El Salvador.  Guandique may not have realized that law enforcement in the United States is much better at catching rapists than in his home country - where rapists frequently avoid prosecution.  </p>
<p>Incidently, should a &#8220;guest&#8221; worker program be instituted here, what would keep men like Guandique from entering the U.S. legally, being as criminals often evade detection in many places south of our border and hence would have a clean record.  </p>
<p>Had U.S. authorities made any attempt to deport Guandique prior to his committing the assaults, immigration advocates would have screamed racism; they would have preferred that Guandique receive immediate U.S. citizenship as well as money for college and housing.  I think I read that Guandique had fathered a child in the U.S., so he might be a gift that keeps on giving.</p>

			<p>As I have stated on this website many, many times before,  Miss Levy just experienced the kind of diversity that she and her &#8220;sisters&#8221; vote for.</p>

			<p>Strange as it seems, the only reason this case was solved is because Gary Condit was a potential suspect, which attracted attention to the case.  </p>

			<p>Nonwhites sexually pursue Americas attractive white girls out of a base desire to fornicate.<br>
The sexualization of white women by the media and the base poverty of nonwhites factor  in to bring the epidemic to a national level.<br>
White men must keep a strong hold on their children and teach<br>
them to be aware that the ruling class socialists do not intend<br>
for them to count in an increasingly multicultual nation.</p>

			<p>Thanks to our &#8220;open border policy&#8221; to benefit the business owners and corporations&hellip; we don&rsquo;t know HOW MANY killers and rapists are currently in our country, or will sneak in tomorrow. Which is WHY I think every homeowner should have a weapon readily at hand, with wives taught how to safely use and handle firearms. Call it cheap insurance. Comforting to know it&rsquo;s there, should you ever need it.</p>

			<p>I know &#8220;random attack&#8221; are codes words for minority-on-white crimes but what do columnists mean by it?</p>
<p>Do criminals flip a coin on who they are going to attack on these &#8220;random&#8221; attacks?</p>

That&rsquo;s only part of it.  It&rsquo;s hardly all.   If all they want is &#8220;to fornicate&#8221; they could pursue that goal elsewhere. <br>
Media and poverty, maybe peripheral,  are not primary causes either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about RACE!  The attack on white women has elements of racial hate, racial subjugation,  racial conquest&hellip;. which go far beyond just a matter of &#8220;fornication&#8221;.  These are not even basically about sex.  With non-whites, violating a white woman is seen as sort of a racial evening of the score, payback, or whatever you want to call it.   Basically, he&rsquo;s getting even with hated Whitey by attacking and degrading Whitey&rsquo;s woman.</p>
<p>PS. The perceptive comment by MW above is on the mark.  It&rsquo;s sad but, in this case, very appropriate.</p>

			<p>  The whole Sandra Levy affair was mishandled from the start. <br>
Gary Condit was never a serious suspect for the murder. It was not a crime of passion, but a calculated rape and murder. So wealthy white Congressman Condit is going to follow Sandra Levy to the park and murder her? This is the type of ridiculous stuff we see on television (Women&rsquo;s channel) all the time, but the reality is more often quite different  &mdash;  Federal crime statistics tell us as much. </p>

			<p>I remember the media hysteria about this. It was a slow news summer until the terrorists hit (then the story was dropped like a hot potato). They so wanted to pin it on Condit. It was the great White defendant phenomenon. The sad part is that Chandra Levy and her fellow-travellers would probably support stuff like amnesties, open borders and the like - the very thing that got her killed.</p>

			<p>I remember the last time I was in Washington DC in the mid 1990s.  I was at a nice restaraunt.  There was one pretty, blonde young woman surrounded by Black and Brown men, all seeming intent on wooing her.  I wondered then if she would be allowed to walk out of there alone.</p>
