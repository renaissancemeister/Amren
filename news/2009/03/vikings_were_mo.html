			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Niall Firth, Daily Mail (London), March 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For more than a thousand years they have had a reputation for raping, pillaging and engaging in violent conquests.</p>
<p>But new research suggests that this violent image of the Vikings may be a little unfair.</p>
<p>In fact, some academics claim that the Norsemen were &#8216;model immigrants&rsquo; who lived side-by-side in relative harmony with the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic locals.</p>
<p>In 793 the Vikings launched their first brutal raid on England, hacking monks to death and terrifying villagers at a priory in Lindisfarne.</p>
<p>But they soon became an &#8216;integral part of the fabric of social and political life&rsquo;, according to academics at Cambridge University.</p>
<p>Dr Fiona Edmonds said: &#8216;The latest evidence does not point to a simple opposition between &#8216;Vikings&rsquo; and &#8216;natives&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Within a relatively short space of time  &mdash;  and with lasting effect  &mdash;  the various cultures in Britain and Ireland started to intermingle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Researchers say the Vikings should been seen as an early example of immigrants who were successfully assimilated into British and Irish culture.</p>
<p>A combination of new archaeological evidence and analysis of the language, literature and coinage of the period was used to come to this surprising new conclusion.</p>
<p>The findings appear to fly in the face of accepted theories about the Vikings and their barbarous ways.</p>
<p>But researchers are insistent that this is more than just an attempt to manipulate history to fit modern-day political correct attitudes.</p>
<p>Dr Maire Ni Mhaonaigh, who is co-organising the three-day conference in Cambridge on the subject, genuinely believes modern-day Britons today can learn from such positive immigration.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;Most people&rsquo;s image of the Vikings centres on their arrival and disruption but that only continued for a very short period of time.</p>
<p>&#8216;Afterwards they started building settlements and interacting with the locals and became assimilated into their culture and influenced them in many ways.</p>
<p>&#8216;As such they provide a clear example of how a particular group came into a sophisticated established society and the resulting interaction was positive.</p>
<p>&#8216;Both societies profited and modern day people can take a lesson from this that two cultures coming together can learn from each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p> Dr Edmonds said: &#8216;Investigating that process provides us with a historical model of how political groups can be absorbed into complex societies, contributing much to those societies in the process,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;There are important lessons that can be gained from this about cultural assimilation in the modern era.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After the initial  &mdash;  inevitably violent  &mdash;  conquest, Vikings became an integral part of social and political life in Britain and Ireland between the 9th and 13th centuries, the research suggests.</p>
<p>It also shows the Vikings, Celts and Anglo-Saxons exchanged a lot of cultural ideas such as story-telling and ship building.</p>
<p>There is even evidence that suggests that Vikings adopted Christianity and intermarried with their English and Irish counterparts.</p>
<p>Recent studies of regional coinage from the period also show that Viking rulers developed economies influenced by cultures they encountered on arrival.<br>

			<p>The Vikings expanded greatly at that time because of a natural global warming that happened between 1000 AD and 1400 AD. Does anyone else observe that?</p>

			<p>This is a highly misleading article.  There is nothing at all new here.  The Anglo-Saxons and Celts, and the Scandinavians/Norse/Vikings were ethnically and culturally very closely related.  In fact, the Anglo-Saxons could be described as &#8220;proto-Vikings&#8221;, coming to the country now known as England from part of the same area of north-western Europe as the Vikings, but 300 years earlier.  Their languages were mutually intelligible - slightly different dialects of what was essentially the same language, in fact.<br>
Before their conversion to Christianity, the Anglo-Saxons worshipped the same pagan gods as the Vikings - Woden/Odin, Thunor/Thor, etc.<br>
It is not surprising that these  two very similar communities were able to assimilate and integrate fairly easily.<br>
The very term, &#8220;Viking&#8221;, is, in itself, a misleading one.  Strictly speaking, the &#8220;vikings&#8221; were the relatively small number of warriors/raiders/pirates operating out of Scandinavia from the 8th to the 11th century.  The vast majority of Scandinavian immigrants to Britain during this period were not &#8220;vikings&#8221; as such, but farmers, craftsmen and merchants.<br>
As for - &#8220;There is even evidence that suggests that Vikings adopted Christianity and intermarried with their English and Irish counterparts.&#8221; -  this is an insult to the intelligence.  There is a huge volume of well established evidence that this is, of course, exactly what happened, not least the very existence of the modern English and Irish (not to mention the Scottish and Welsh) nations.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons shared the same &#8220;Teutonic&#8221; origins for religion and culture and were - I don&rsquo;t know - <b>northern Europeans</b>, not Middle Easterners, sub-Saharan Africans or East Asians?</p>
<p>Of course there was widepsread settlement of Vikings in Britain (maps of natural blondes in Britain and the Danelaw correlate pretty well), and I have an ethnological text from Archive.Org which claims that in northern Britain &#8220;almost every household had a Scandinavian mother or father&#8221; (an exaggeration to be sure), but using this to &#8220;justify&#8221; that white Britons should really just adopt the &#8220;good bits&#8221; of foreign culture and marry their children off to the foreign hordes is as silly as the &#8220;Englishmen are just mongrels because Romans/Anglo-Saxons/Vikings/Normans invaded them!&#8221; myth.</p>

			<p>Good God, the Marxist Liberal brainwashing gets even more extreme and deadly.</p>
<p>For example:  <b>&#8220;After the initial - inevitably violent - conquest,</b> Vikings became an integral part of social and political life in Britain and Ireland between the 9th and 13th centuries, the research suggests.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, the Marxist Liberal elite are prepared to preside over mass genocide of indigenous peoples  of the five countries that comprise the British Isles  via PERPETUAL open borders Third World invasion of unrelated alien races and cultures.  At least, the Vikings were of the same race of peoples as the native Britons just as the Taiwanese &amp; Chinese are of the same race which does not affect their genetic survival and thus lead to extinction as mass Third World non-white invasion threatens to do to white nations in their homelands.   </p>
<p>Furthermore, this 60 year old unfettered invasion which still has no end in sight, has been deliberately engineered to destroy  the ancient peoples of the British Isles, their heritages, history, cultures, religious beliefs and languages.  </p>
<p>Now, I notice, even native status is being denied us.<br>

<p>The Vikings, Celts, and Anglo-Saxons were all white, hence the willingness to assimilate to and breed with one another.</p>

That&rsquo;s comparing apples and pears. <br>
European immigrants to other European nations usually assimilated really well after a while. At one time, about one third of the population of Berlin was francophone (Hugenots fleeing Catherine of Medici). <br>
Unfortunately, in contrast to what is apparently implied here, <br>
it won&rsquo;t be anything like this with immigrants from such utterly different racial and cultural backgrounds. </p>

			<p>And guess what? The Vikings and Anglo-Saxons spoke closely-related languages, and came from a common ethnic and cultural background. </p>
<p>The Celts, although linguistically and culturally further removed from the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons than they were from each other, were nevertheless also Northern Europeans.</p>
<p>The lesson to be learned is this: SIMILAR people get along!</p>

<p>Yes, but only because they all had many similarities, most especially race, so if you&rsquo;re setting up a case in order to justify bringing in non-whites here hoping to show that they too will be successful just like the vikings, I would suggest you are just too foolish to understand the difference and get into another line of work. </p>

<p>Berlin had a tiny francophone minority but one third of the population of Berlin was NEVER francophone. Do not exaggerate the facts.</p>
<p>And Frenchmen living in Germany have still been attending French schools even today. Hence they are not assimilated.</p>

<p>It might be more correct to read/write &#8216;Researchers say the Vikings should be seen as an early example of migrants who were successfully assimilated into British and Irish cultures&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Given the similarities of the groups, I would think they would be more migrants than immigrants.  I think the word &#8216;Vik&rsquo; in old Danish means stream or river.  Referring to the people who lived along the streams and rivers that carried commerce to and from the South and Southeast North to Scandinavia. Sweden had a large land empire stretching from the North to the Crimea.  Finally tapped out with the Great Northern War.  Google Great Northern War for general info going back to this early time.</p>

			<p>Let us set the record straight. The word viking means sea raider in old Norse. The Norse engaged in a age of piliage, colonization, and conquest that spread across  Europe and even to North America. The Norse were merchants,farmers,sea farers, and warriors all in one. The word Normandy derives from the word Norse;as word Russian derives from Rus,a Norse tribal name.<br>
Modern Europe and America are at it&rsquo;s core Norse/ Celtic/  Teutonic. It&rsquo;s our true heritage. The heritage that created the modern world.</p>

			<p>They were peaceful pilgrims all right. They damned near wiped out all English speakers and &#8221; Blood Eagled &#8221; everybody in sight. That is where they would rip out somebody`s lungs while still alive and fold them back. They raided from Ireland to Constantinople and up the Seine to Paris itself. They enslaved local populations and sold them to the Arabs.I would still trade them for those that comes up from Central America.<br>

While in one sense this supports the concept of &#8216;genetic similarity&rsquo;, I believe the author is only giving credence (perhaps unintentionally) that all immigration, when given enough time and hindsight, turns out to be a positive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all read the articles in the WSJ, LA Times, and NYT that tell us the same thing. &#8220;Immigrants from Ireland were considered trash. They were seen and acted as brutes and thugs. But over time, they assimilated to become successful and even a President&#8221;.</p>
<p>These articles are all sending one message: that our fear of immigrants displacing us are irrational, unfounded, and even silly.</p>
<p>Populations may have shifted over time but they didn&rsquo;t have to. Look at China. How many thousands of years has that country remained homogeneous? Population shifts used to be driven by wars and invasions. Now we have economic invasions that are going to overwhelm host populations and for no other reason than someone can save or make money in the process even if it means killing the host.</p>

<p>Celts are not Germanic. However, together with Slavs and Germans, they are members of the Northwest European group. Two European groups (Southern group consisting of Italians, Greeks, Spanish) evolved from the original Europeans that fled to two different directions escaping the last glaciation. When they returned after some thousand years, they were two differing groups&hellip;</p>

			<p>Wow only 4 centuries for full assimilation..and that only because<br>
the Norseman, the Anglo Saxons and Celts were already very close<br>
culturally to begin with. Now how long will it take for people from the Middle East and Asia to intergrate into British culture. People of a utterly different culture, with a religion like Islam preaching continual undying hatred of Christians&hellip;and a massive Govermental bureaucracy to perpetuate their isolation? Four millenia&hellip;.or will rather British culture simply be crushed&hellip;as it already is?</p>

			<p>This is the same pro-immigration angle that got shoved at the American People in THE FARMER&rsquo;S DAUGHTER, a propaganda flick from 1947.  The immigrant daughter in question was a beautiful and sensible Swede, whose parents were immigrants.  The bad guys, of course were anti-immigration, anti&hellip;.(pretty much everything we here on Amren are anti&hellip;), and, of course were portrayed as ugly, uncouth louts.  The moral of the film, of course was &#8220;Immigrants good.  Nativists bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The absurdity(and the implicit lie)of the premise is that Scandinavian immigrants are somehow equivalent to ALL immigrants.  Remember, 1947 was about the time that the Nazi ratline was funneling Croatian Ustasi (please google the term)into America as &#8220;freedom fighters&#8221;, along with no telling what else. The American people were being encouraged to just shut up and submit&hellip;.once again, to an influx of people who clearly had nothing positive to offer.  And beautiful Loretta Young (how conveeeeenient Young&rsquo;s new religion was the same as that of the Ustasi) was being used as a brainwashing tool.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m reading THE MIDIEVAL UNDERWORLD.  One nugget I&rsquo;ve extracted is that gratuitous torture was the norm in all of Midieval Europe, except in Scandinavia.  I could go into all the ways that Scandics are better than us Celts (I&rsquo;m a Cajun redhead), but that torture thing gets at the heart of the matter.  They&rsquo;re smarter, nicer, kinder, bigger, and way prettier than the rest of us.  Their societies work.  They are a light unto the world.  </p>
<p>There is an implicit assumption in this article that Viking immigration is somehow equivalent to immigration from Somalia, Algeria, or Bangladesh.  NO, IT ISN&rsquo;T.  Scandinavia is where good things come from.  The Third World is where bad things come from.  It is no coincidence that the Swedes are leaders in re-use of industrial byproducts (they&rsquo;ve almost got a closed-loop going), that Denmark has the first energy-sustainable community (takes brains and altruism to set up and operate one of those), and that most of the tenets of Modern democracy we so cherish come down from the Viking rulers of England.</p>
<p>The fallacy of this article is that it implicitly denies the reality that some ethnic groups have much to offer, while other groups have little or nothing to offer.</p>

<p>Every time there&rsquo;s some study about quality of life, livability, or other desirability factors, if it&rsquo;s a study of countries, Sweden, Norway and Denmark will be at the top or very near the top.  If it is of U.S. States, Minnesota will be at or near the top.  If it is of incorporated cities, some suburb of Minneapolis will be on top.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is that Scandinavians and their diaspora create the best places, and the best environments, yet they&rsquo;re the most liberal when it comes to race.  It seems that the whiter the white, the more liberal the white.</p>

I disagree completely with this view that &#8220;all good things come out of Scandinavia&#8221;, which seems to put down (us) Southern Europeans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Italian. The earliest reference to the firearm is found in Florence, Italy. The first artificial canals in Europe were built in Italy. Perspective in the arts was introduced in Italy. Spectacles were invented in Italy. Music notation, the violin, the piano and in fact most of  early classical music came from Italy. And it was the  Roman Church (led by Italians, mind you) that unified Europe under a single religion and gave this continent the guts to go face the Islamic hordes in their own territory.</p>
<p>The Ancient Romans, with their roads, acquiducts, sewer systems, inventions such as the lock or the candle, legal principles, and ability to hold up a world empire for centuries, the ancient Greeks with their philosophy and mathemathics, were Southern Europeans.</p>
<p>I know, some Scandinavian supremacists will say that the Greeks and the Romans were really blonde, blue eyed Nordics. This is at odds with what we see in ancient figurative art. I remember reading some ancient Roman author (unfortunately I forgot which one) who disapproved of the Roman women who dyed their hair from black to blonde, which in his opinion made them look like barbarian Germans. Which is also proof that the local complexion of the Romans was quite dark. Blondeness was associated with being foreign.</p>
<p>You can also gather information about how the ancient Italian geniuses looked like, from both the words of contemporaries and contemporary portraits. How did Thomas Aquinas, Caravaggio, Machiavelli, Medici family members look like? I&rsquo;m mentioning these particular ones because I saw pictures of them and know  they look relatively swarthy, but you can use any list of Italian Renaissance artists. I never saw a single pair of blue eyes or porcelain skin tones among those historic Italians. I also saw a lot of pronounced noses that are hardly Nordic.</p>
<p>I respect Scandinavia very much, but just to straigthen things, I have to say that not only good things came from there. Bad things too, from ancient Viking barbaric, berserkr mindset (do we really believe that those slaughters of monks never happened?) to modern cowardly Scandinavian liberalism and secularism. These days, Italy has far more chances to survive the Islamic invasions than the countries to its north.<br>

			<p>Aye, there&rsquo;s the rub, Question Diversity!  Scandinavians are wired for altruism.  It&rsquo;s an integral component of their being.  They&rsquo;re born that way.  It&rsquo;s a heritable trait for them.  It&rsquo;s their nature to be honest, equitable, generous,tolerant, and kind.</p>
<p>And that ingrained altruism is currently proving to be their downfall.  It worked in their favor, when they were isolated bands of Ice Age survivors.  The qualities I&rsquo;ve mentioned kept their numbers large enough to ensure a viable breeding population.  But in a pluralistic world, those qualities leave Scandics vulnerable to idealogues and other con-men (I&rsquo;m thinking politicians, here).  People from populations hard-wired for deviousness easily subjugate and manipulate the fair-minded and trusting Scandics.  </p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve just said is simply an expansion of the oft-repeated saying, &#8220;Tolerance is the achilles heel of the West&#8221;.  Scandinavians, and the good things that come from them, in large degree ARE the West.</p>

			<p>Speaking of gratuitous torture, another thing about the Italian-led Roman Church is that it always effectively opposed torture and other barbaric practices. In the sixteenth century, witch burning was common in the Protestant North, certainly not in Italy. Again, when it comes to torture, the Vatican dictated very strict guidelines to the Spanish Inquisition, such as that torture couldn&rsquo;t last more than fifteen minutes and should never cause any permanent disfigurement. By comparison, at the same time England practiced barbarous stuff such as drawing and quartering. And it was in Italy that certain causes which would now be seen as progressive and enlightened, such as opposition to death penalty, showed up first. Not that all those ideas are necessarily good, of course, but I&rsquo;m just trying to say that the stereotype of a backwards, violent Southern Europe is completely misguided.</p>
<p>I recognize that it&rsquo;s childish to get into discussion such as my country is better than your country. It isn&rsquo;t this that I&rsquo;m trying to do. I&rsquo;m not an Italian supremacist when it comes to confronting white cultures. I just disagree with the notion that all that is good in Europe comes from the Norse and other Germanic races. That idea is only widespread in countries that have a Germanic background, and it is mostly due to the fact that those countries, like any country in the world, know more about themselves than they do about their neighbours. I could just as easily build up a demonstration that all the good in the world comes from Italy (not that I think so). For that matter the Chinese or the Japanese or the Jews, all of whom have high IQ&rsquo;s and sophisticated cultures, could easily find arguments to say that all the good in the world comes from themselves (again, not that I think that would be correct).</p>

			<p>It isn&rsquo;t even true that modern democracy comes exclusively from the Scandinavians, as someone in this thread believes. Italian city-state republics such as Venice had an elective, representative government since the Dark Ages, which influenced the writings of Machiavelli, which in turn influenced the American Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:<br>
(Machiavelli&rsquo;s) Discourse on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy comprises the early history of Rome, it is a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured, including the concept of checks and balances, the strength of a tri-partite political structure, and the superiority of a republic over a principality.</p>
<p><br>
Also, the United Kingdom introduced male universal suffrage only as late as 1918; Italy did the same six years earlier, in 1912.</p>

			<p>I wonder how much these people were paid for doing this disgraceful piece of &#8220;research&#8221;. The unsurprising facts about the rapid and easy assimilation of the Scandinavians by their first cousins, the English, have always been known. All that these &#8220;researchers&#8221; have done is to put a politically correct spin on them to provide ammunition for pro-immigrationists .</p>
<p>Not to worry - the comments accompanying the article on the Mail&rsquo;s website reflect those here on Amren, as stark a sign of the rapidly changing popular mood in England as one could hope for, and only one of many such straws in the wind coming ever thicker and faster. The political consequences - the coming tempest so feared by the Archbishop of Canterbury is close behind. </p>

			<p>  Professor Simon Schama, who has built an very successful career, and an substantial bank balance, as well, as an author and narraotor and lecturer of such BBC prorgrams as «A History of Britain,» and «The Romance of Britain,» «in between» stints as an professor of art history at Columbia University, New  York, did state, in the first of the aforementioned documentaries that : «If one looks at an culture and an civilisation long enough, you will probably find something about it that you will like.» That may be so. But. (but), the ruins of the monastery at Yarrow (where Bede (the venerable), wrote his Anglo - Saxon chronicle), as well as the round towers, the fortified ruins of monasteries throughout Britain and Ireland, (the «Rock of Cashel» as an example), are an eloquent, if at times enigmatic testimony that the irrruption of these sea faring invaders was «problematic» at best.</p>
<p>  Eventually the Vikings did integrate; but, (but),  they caused immense damage «along the way.» In my father&rsquo;s home town in Ireland, the Viking&rsquo;s bacame assimilated among the «12 tribes of Galway Town.» And an «détenté» existed between the «parvenus» - and very aggressive «newcomers,» and the native inhabitants, the former becoming «more Irish than the Irish themselves» until the arrival of the Cromwellians. In the 1650&rsquo;s. <br>
 And,In 1979, there was an immense outcry, when land developers uncovered substantial remains of «Viking Dublin,» beneath the foundations of an number of banal, 18th and 19th century residential and commmercial properties. the urban «castle house,» one of which was appropriated by Yeats himself (for 10£ sterling), as an cheap literary redoubt where he experimented with words and thoughts, and eventually came up with «Ulysses.» -but (But) proceeded to pave them over. After having «slushed up» the government of «Charlie» Haughey.</p>
<p>  But, (but), this must not divert our gaze from the immense destruction which «the Northmen» wrought upon Britain and Ireland; and, indeed all of Northern Europe. And parts of Southern Europe as well. And, even, the «Maghreb.» North Africa, as well. Remember well the prayer, of monks and nuns (relatively) safe within the castellated monasteries and tall towers, of East Anglia, Lindisfarne, Yarrow, and Cashel, and the rural folk «round about.» «From the fury of the NorthMen, Good God deliver us.»  As Doctor Monteith would say : «Amen to that.»</p>

			<p>Ever heard of the flying eagle viking torture execution?</p>
<p>They laid the victim on his stomach.  They cut along the sides of his spine, thus severing the ribs.  Then they grabbed the ribs and ripped them to the sides, thus creating &#8216;wings&#8221;  This exposed the lungs, heart and other organs to the outside air and the victim died after several days of incredible agony.</p>
<p>A major export of the vikings from Britian was fair skinned women and boys sold to the Arabs as sex slaves.</p>
<p>Right up until about 1920 there was extreme prejudice against redheads in Britian.  It was considered a horrible disfigurement.</p>
<p>Some anthropoligists and historians consider that this prejudice against redheads comes from the fact that so many vikings were red heads.</p>
<p>There was an official prayer in every European catholic prayer book.  It began something like: O Lord deliver us from the Vikings and their vicious dogs.  Those who wrote and said that prayer did not love the Vikings.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the sack of the Monastery at Lindsfarne?  </p>
<p>Too bad these Britian hating facist marxist liberals can&rsquo;t go back to 800 AD and experience the full effects of the Viking invasion. </p>

<p>With the men and older women slaughtered and the younger women taken as sex slaves by the Vikings of course their was intermingling. </p>

			<p>Let me get this straight:Native Born White Americans are going to be better off in the long run if they tolerate an immigration policy that will:</p>
<p>1)reduce Native born White Americans to  very small percentage of the US population</p>
<p>2)cause the US population to grow to a billion,keeping in mind that once the billion mark is reached there will be enormous demographic momentum built in to keep the US population growing for decades after.</p>
<p>3)and because of 2) massive ecological destruction within the borders of the US and a massive loss of the amenities such as the great national and state parks.</p>
<p>4)And in addition to being made of very small racial minnority within the borders of America, the average wages for Native born White Americans will be extremly low&hellip;.third world level.</p>
<p>5)Native Born White Americans  will experience massive discrimination at the hands of post -1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans and there will be the very real possibility of chattel slavery for Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Here is the truth:If and when Native Born White Americans are reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within  the borders of America you can be certain that the following would be a 0 probability event:Sandeep and his wife  and children sitting around the dinner table sayinf the following:Sandeep &#8220;you know we hindus Americans would be much better off if we opened the door to massive Europen immigration. America needs a very large European American population. Its their turn. WE must not be racists. We need to prove we are not racists. WE must support a legal immigration policy that will make us hindus and sikhs in America a racial minority&#8221;&hellip;.. There is not a snowballs chance in hell that if Whites become a racial  minority in America that post-1965 non-whites will support a LEGAL immigration policy that allow Native Born White Americans to become a racial majority ever again.</p>

			<p>   I think Nat Geo did a piece quite a while ago and in it stated,&#8221; if the Vikings were indeed brutes, they were brutes in a brutal age.&#8221; I took the magazine for over 20 years but discontinued it after they published a piece on the Montgomery-Selma march that I saw as being nothing more than cheap propaganda . Doing despicable things seems to be a hallmark of all rising cultures including European . Rome and Greece before her may have truly been the vanguards of civilization but they both did some very terrible things . I am not advocating we forget the bad as we need to remember so as not to repeat it, but it is imperative we remember the good and embrace every white Euro culture (ancient and otherwise) as a valuable part of our own heritage . We for the most part have outgrown our warlike proclivities simply for the sake of war . If the non-white cultures had,they would not now be so steeped in past ages we left behind long ago or at best living some bizzare hi-tech medieval or even prehistoric existence . Being only 9% of the world population it can truly be said we are now living Fort Apache, Planet Nightmare .We&rsquo;ve got to pull together or we are not going to make it .These ancient white cultures belong to all of us who carry the tag,&#8221;European&#8221; and we should be proud of them and embrace their memory while avoiding their mistakes .</p>

			<p>Scandinavians certainly allowed themselves to be convinced that the culture of Southern Europe was superior to theirs.  They copied Italian architecture, etc., with zeal. And I might add that they far surpassed (in technical perfection) the models they were copying.</p>
<p>Scandics did not challenge the (church motivated)historians who portrayed the Vikings as plundering destroyers.  I am descended from a people who have been exploited by the purveyors of religion for well over a thousand years (Cajuns/Bretons).  We&rsquo;ve heard all the sophistic arguments defending big religion; all the calm, gentle reminders that the Inquisition was not bad at all; all the seductive and well-crafted lies.  So I expected to hear someone say that the church was &#8216;effectively&rsquo; anti-torture.  </p>
<p>But it was Americans, not the Church, who took it upon themselves to pull us Cajuns up from our midieval existence, and into the modern world.  They gave us the chance at enlightenment and prosperity, and we grabbed it.  And what set Americans apart in the world was their Scandinavian altruism and intelligence.  </p>
<p>Italians(I&rsquo;m speaking of Italy-proper)are lovely people, and certainly lead the world in aesthetics.  They did more than any occupied nation (except possibly Denmark) to protect their Jews, during the holocaust.  IQ AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS lists the Italian collective IQ as equal to that of Great Britain.  Italian cuisine is certainly superior to the sugary, buttery slop served in Scandinavia. Personally, I like Italian food better than the best French (I&rsquo;m from Lafayette, honey&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been everywhere, and had the best of the best).  However, I&rsquo;m not backing away from my earlier assertions.  I think I inserted quite enough qualifiers that my statements should not be regarded as absolutist.  But to me Scandinavians lead the world in the areas that matter the most.</p>
<p>Which gets us back to our topic:  AN INFLUX OF VIKINGS IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO AN INFLUX OF THIRD-WORLDERS.  Vikings were superior, in a number of important respects, to those whose cultures they entered.  Third-worlders, in a number of important respects, are&hellip;.well&hellip;.not superior.</p>

			<p><i>Turtle: Let us set the record straight. The word viking means sea raider in old Norse&hellip; The Norse were merchants, farmers, sea farers, and warriors all in one.</i></p>
<p>Sorry <i>Turtle</i> but you&rsquo;re mixing myth with reality. The word &#8216;viking&rsquo; is a verb, it roughly translates to English as &#8216;going on an overseas expedition&rsquo;. Expedition does not imply military conquest in this case.</p>
<p>Correct use of the Norse word would be &#8216;to go a viking&rsquo;. If you want to use the word &#8216;vikings&rsquo; it would translate to &#8216;seamen&rsquo;, as in people who populated a ship, which could include women and children also.</p>
<p>Random fact: Vikings didn&rsquo;t have horns on their skull caps, it was a myth invented up by Christian survivors in England to mix the devil with the invading force because the raiding parties killed Christian holy men (monks, priests etc) for their gold. It was later adopted by knights and the ruling cast in central Europe as a way of terrorising their enemies.</p>

			<p>Vikings did not wear helmets that had horns attached, but they did wear helmets without them.  Vikings did attempt to settle in Greenland, but that failed miserably beginning in the year 1300, because of what was &#8220;The Little Ice Age&#8221;, that lasted until about 1850.  The Greenland Vikings might have successfully survived, had they been willing to learn and cooperate with the local Iniut, or Eskimos, but these Vikings had a prejudical contempt for these people and referred to them as &#8220;skraelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is well known that the Vikings reached North America about five centuries before Columbus.  I read that one of the things that made the American Indians hostile to the Vikings is that they gave the Indians milk to drink from their cows, in a sincere attempt to befriend the Indians.  But this backfired because of the Indians being lactose-intolerant, they got very sick.  The Indians mistakenly thought the Vikings were trying to poison them and attacked them, as a result.</p>
<p>Anyway, full colonization of North America by the Vikings failed because there were not enough of them to send reinforcements, and America was very far away to sail to. It was not until 500 years later when there would be bigger and better ships to make make European colonization possible.</p>
<p>In comparison, it will be a very long time before any men or women ever travel back to the moon, let alone set foot on Mars, or even travel to the stars, like in &#8220;Star Trek, if any such advancements in space travel ever even happen at all.  Sorry to drop the bucket to any Star Trek fans reading this post.</p>
<p>Probably, the only remaining pure Viking culture is the island nation of Iceland.  Iceland permits no immigration, even of white people.  The Icelandic Norse language is so pure, Leif Ericson would be able to understand Iceland&rsquo;s TV broadcasts and movies, if he were transported in a time machine to 21st century Iceland.  The Icelandic horse is the only horse permitted to be in Iceland.  Dogs are illegal to possess in Iceland.  Imagine no dog poop to worry about stepping into!  Iceland&rsquo;s legislative body, the Dail, I think it is, is still running for over 1000 years.  Please correct me if I am wrong about facts concerning today&rsquo;s Iceland.</p>

&#8220;At one time, about one third of the population of Berlin was francophone (Hugenots fleeing Catherine of Medici).&#8221;<br>
Posted by Anonymous at 8:20 PM<br>
_____</p>
<p>Berlin had a tiny francophone minority but one third of the population of Berlin was NEVER francophone. Do not exaggerate the facts.<br>
And Frenchmen living in Germany have still been attending French schools even today. Hence they are not assimilated.<br>
William Cutting<br>
====================</p>
<p>Let me come to the defense of Anonymous who I find generally knows his facts and does not &#8220;exaggerate&#8221;. (I&rsquo;ve checked out his facts before and found them to be always right.)</p>
<p>I do not know the Huguenots exact numbers, but I do remember that there is a French cathedral in Berlin.  There are also many French family names.  On checking this, according to Wikipedia, <i>&#8220;the first parts of the actual French Church  were built from 1701 to 1705 for the Huguenot (Calvinist) community. <b>At that time Huguenots made up about 25% of Berlin&rsquo;s population. </b> The French Church was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot temple in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France.&#8221;</i>  Berlin also hosted a considerable Dutch colony, as did Potsdam,    &mdash;   all well assimilated long ago, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>There were also a great many Huguenots who settled in Hamburg. (According to a German professor I know, who is from Hamburg: &#8220;Oh, Hamburg is full of  them!&#8221;); and there are a lot of their descendents in Copenhagen as well. </p>
<p>I see no reason to say they have not assimilated!  Just because some have preserved the French language does not mean they have not mastered the local languages or assimilated.  In fact, they have done so extremely well,  and often occupy prominent positions in local society.  Thomas de Maizière, the example you cited (as having attended French schools and being &#8220;not -assimilated&#8221;!)  attended  the Aloisiuskolleg in Bonn,  the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität in Münster, and the University of Freiburg.  Hardly French!  Nor would he occupy an important position in the German government  (head of the Chancellor&rsquo;s Office) if he remained &#8220;unassimilated&#8221;.</p>
<p>A &#8220;tiny&#8221; francophone minority?    Twenty-five percent?  Sorry, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s guilty of exaggerating!   You should check your own facts before lighting into those who know theirs.</p>

Or if she was brutally gang raped by a gang of lebanese &#8220;Australian&#8221; youth in a Sydney suburb? How about if she was brutally gand raped by a gang of Hmong youth in the Twin Cities area?</p>
<p>Pointed-headed Professors such as Professor Mhaonaigh should be forced to experince the full blessings of diversity. It would be a very important social science experiment.

<p>I am Celtic on my mother&rsquo;s side, so I sympathize.</p>
<p>But you must admit, the Celts were a wild bunch and they (or at least some) asked the Normans to come to Ireland. They overstayed their welcome! What a lesson in human nature.</p>
<p>Great things were done by the Nortwest Europeans, but this chronicle of violence and torture is depressing. If you must kill your enemy, then do so, but do not torture him. At the very least, this shows fear and cowardice on your part.</p>
<p>Roman, when I read that the Celts would go into the horrific &#8220;warp-spasm&#8221; and challenge any Roman to singles combat (an honorable thing in itself) and oftentimes the Roman GENERALS would answer the challenge, instead of commanding a foot-soldier to go, I gained more respect for the Roman character. </p>

			<p>My view is that most likely from a genetic perspective<br>
is that most of the viking types left their genetic mark<br>
outside Scandinavia and that it is England and France and<br>
the Netherlands that represented a kind of echo of the viking<br>
age during the colonial period.</p>
<p>This is actually why in general the continental world <br>
considers the anglophone world to be unruly and have a <br>
disregard for the methodical planning.  They are seen as<br>
adventurers and conquerors in a sense.</p>
<p>Note that the Scandinavians were not successful at colonial<br>
expansion during this 19th century age.</p>

<p>I live in Germany and my German is near-perfect. Those numbers are of course greatly exaggerated because of the distortion of statistics which is always done in the UK, too (to show how &#8220;multicultural the city is. If you just include the very center of city, they do make up a larger percentage, despite this no more than 15%). There is a French cathedral in Berlin, that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Do you really believe that 15.000-20.000 Frenchmen really made up 20-25% of the Berlin&rsquo;s population (3-4 in the 19 and 20th century)? Come on!</p>
<p>The Dutch are just lower Franconians, hence they are just Low Germans, not too different from Lower Saxons or Rhinelanders/Westphalians. A different &#8220;Dutch&#8221; identity is not very old.  </p>
<p>Germans like to show how &#8220;foreigner-friendly&#8221; they are which makes no sense. They do it in Ruhr area as well although very large numbers of Poles were expelled or killed during the 2WW.</p>
<p>There are/were ministers in Belgium and Sweden who were/are of Turkish origin. Do you consider those people as &#8220;assimilated&#8221; or just &#8220;Turks&#8221;?</p>
<p>I think you have to check your resources. Wikipedia is not a reliable source on disputed issues, especially racial/ethnic ones. </p>

<p>Not accurate to say the least. I&rsquo;m not sure where you got this from dude. The Icelandic gene pool is about 30% celtic due to immigration from Scotland and Ireland. This &#8220;immigration&#8221; was mostly slaves. There&rsquo;s plenty of dogs in Iceland and the parliament is called &#8220;Alþingi&#8221; (Althing). It&rsquo;s 1000 years old but wasn&rsquo;t active for most of the time since Iceland was ruled by Norway and later Denmark for about 750 years. There&rsquo;s plenty of immigrants in Iceland although not as many as in other Nordic countries - yet. I don&rsquo;t think Leif Ericsson would understand much were he resurrected since pronounciation has changed but he would probably be able to read the newspapers.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to comment on something postulated above - that the whiter people are, the more tolerant. The fact is that the less experience people have with immigrants and non-white races in general, the more tolerant they are. Scandinavians are tolerant because most haven&rsquo;t been exposed to the wonders of multiculturalism. Those who have are not tolerant. Same in the US where, statistically, whites are less likely to be negative towards blacks the fewer blacks are in their area. Owerwhelmingly white areas in the US are more likely to be liberal while whites in mixed areas are conservatives. Contact with multiculturalism breeds conservativism.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I just disagree with the notion that all that is good in Europe comes from the Norse and other Germanic races. That idea is only widespread in countries that have a Germanic background, and it is mostly due to the fact that those countries, like any country in the world, know more about themselves than they do about their neighbours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here in the US we&rsquo;ve always had the Anglo Saxon&rsquo;s version of history and of course that history was revered.  The Romans are noted for their contributions to engineering.  Florence and Venice were the centers of the Italian renaissance and who cannot deny the beauty of the arts that flourished in that region.  The Florence dome by Brunoleschi was quite an achievement for its time.  They are hardly slouches in contributing to European civilization.  </p>

			<p>When people make these sort of analogies they miss that we are now living in the modern era when civilization had expanded and stabalized the European country-sides (regardless of wars) and the period of open settlement was over just as it began in the New World.  A grasp of social geography would help prevent dumb comparisons like this because today world stabalizing civilization is at risk, not just a local township here and there.  In addition, the actual homoengenity of Anglo-Saxons and Nordics is undeniable while Arabs and Africans was racially and culturally a stick in the spokes of the indigenous populations of White and ultimately pre-historic Celtic-Germanic tribe settlement of Northern Europe.  Gerard Herm&rsquo;s book, &#8220;The Celts&#8221; lays out the facts as they are known, through acheology, linguistic studies, and what the Christians didn&rsquo;t destroy of the oral traditions (a couple of which became recorded in forms such as The Nebelungen, Arthurian Legends, The Welsh Mabinogan and other Celtic hero tales, The Pearl, Sagas,etc.) </p>
<p>Although some details remain open for further future clarification as more evidence is discovered, ALL the peoples exploited by this article as method of justifying a racial and ethnic shift away from the indigenous ancient race and regional cultures to accomodate the modern incursion and transformation of extra-continental races and cultures is nothing less than genocide.  What is most alarming about it is that it is being done without war as in a place such as Darfur, so resistance can be shrugged off as issues such as racism, etc., and no issue made of the murder of indigenous people in Europe at all.</p>

<p>Yes, and they used to barbecue monks in their round towers in Ireland (but they didn&rsquo;t eat them!).</p>
<p>But they did settle in - in fact in Ireland for example, Dublin was a Viking settlement originally as was Waterford (Vaterfjiord).  Northumbria (Yorkshire) in Englands is a well known center of Viking settlement.</p>

			<p>I am a descendant of King Alfred (Wessex). The Saxon who routed the Vikings out of much of England Mid to late 9th century.<br>
He was called Alfred the good or great because he brought schools and trial by jury. Peace too.<br>
Vikings, Saxons, Celts etc. were very closely related.<br>
Third world invaders want nothing more than to wipe out all of the White folks in England. This is a horrible comparison.<br>
What do modern immigrants bring to Britain? Hate, distruction and the extirpation of Indigenous English thats what.<br>
Assimilation! What a load of hooey. <br>

<p>Roman is right- Arabs/Mediterranean are different from people of Germanic/Celtic/Slavic origin. <br>
Beyond the racial differences in IQ there are personality differences between Caucasians of purely European and those of Near Eastern origin. </p>
<p>One quibble-Italy was already invaded numerous times by Arabs, leaving behind the genes for low IQ, vendetta and corruption. Around ten percent of Spanish Y chromosomes are from Moorish invaders. I applaud Spain, Italy, Greece for resisting liberalism and for past contributions but Arabs have already ravished its native population.</p>
<p>I know the Islamic culture is awful and Western culture must be protected but if there is significant admixture between White Europeans and Near Easterners, I must say, I really do not care much after that.</p>

<p>I can see your point there. That makes good sense.  Most French Protestants have traditionally come from Alsace-Lorraine. They could assimilate in Germany easily. And you&rsquo;re quite right about the Dutch being able to blend right in, being Germans themselves (although nowadays they hate to admit it!).  Thank you. I appreciate your statistics.</p>

			<p>Please forgive me for hurting anyone&rsquo;s feelings, but I feel the need to get something off my chest and this forum is the only place I can do it.  </p>
<p>When whites marry non-whites, quite often the whites identify with and sympathize with their acquired non-white family, rather than their own white people.  Why is this?    </p>
<p>As an example, I have a relative who married a Mexican-American woman in Texas.  He is now an ardent defender of all things Mexican.  What I think he is doing is by championing the causes of Mexican-Americans, he is championing his choice of a mate, his non-white children, his close Mexican-American relatives and friends, as all of these people are extensions of himself and his identity.  </p>
<p>This is why it is so dangerous for whites to marry or even socialize outside of their race, because not only are their white genes lost when they have children, but their entire white social identity is often lost as well.</p>
<p>Would you like another example?  I have another relative who married a woman from South America.  Now their home is filled with Peruvian art, his wife wears exotic clothing from her native land, and they both talk as though her former country is paradise on earth.  This male relative is to my perspective lost to the white cause because his focus is on his non-white wife, and her focus is on her Peruvian people.</p>

			<p>Vikings were a people of a kindred race from Northwest Europe. They lived alongside us for countless centuries, They shared the same appearance, Gods, customs and so on. They traded and intermingled for generations.</p>
<p>This is vastly diffent to people flooding into the UK from across the globe, bringing their alien and violent creeds and customs with them. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism will not, and cannot, work.</p>
<p>If it could it would naturally have evolved during the course of human history. </p>
<p>Reality shows that it in fact destroys communities, a sense of belonging and trust.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling summed it up in his poem:-</p>
<p>The Stranger<br>
  	<br>
The Stranger within my gate,<br>
He may be true or kind,<br>
But he does not talk my talk  &mdash;  <br>
I cannot feel his mind.<br>
I see the face and the eyes and the mouth,<br>
But not the soul behind.</p>
<p>The men of my own stock,<br>
They may do ill or well,<br>
But they tell the lies I am wanted to,<br>
They are used to the lies I tell;<br>
And we do not need interpreters<br>
When we go to buy or sell.</p>
<p>The Stranger within my gates,<br>
He may be evil or good,<br>
But I cannot tell what powers control  &mdash;  <br>
What reasons sway his mood;<br>
Nor when the Gods of his far-off land<br>
Shall repossess his blood.</p>
<p>The men of my own stock,<br>
Bitter bad they may be,<br>
But, at least, they hear the things I hear,<br>
And see the things I see;<br>
And whatever I think of them and their likes<br>
They think of the likes of me.</p>
<p>This was my father&rsquo;s belief<br>
And this is also mine:<br>
Let the corn be all one sheaf  &mdash;  <br>
And the grapes be all one vine,<br>
Ere our children&rsquo;s teeth are set on edge<br>
By bitter bread and wine.</p>

<p> In general, mediterranian people arent interested in natural science, technology or philosophy, but focus their energies on such things as fashion, art or intrigues. These activities are not wealth generating and its no coincidence that mediterranian/southern EU is a perpetual economic basket case.

<p>Yes, it is funny. Or just ridiculous.  Comparing Vikings to immigrants is absurd.  They came, not as immigrants, but as conquerors. In such a case, if they chose to &#8220;mingle&#8221; with some of the pretty native girls, the locals had little choice about it.  </p>
<p>And they were, at any rate, a closely related European people, with very similar language, religion, customs. They bear simply no comparison with the Nigerians, Pakistanis and Somalis who are invading Britain today.</p>

<p>Growing up in Zoo York City I knew two sisters, both light-skinned Puerto Ricans, who each married an Italian-American male.  One moved to New Jersey where she has only White friends, and who emphatically tells anyone who&rsquo;ll listen that she is in fact, White.  </p>
<p>Her sister, on the other hand, moved out to Colorado with her husband (his company transferred him there).  She dresses like the locals, listens to nothing but classic rock and country/western music, and cooks her family nothing but Italian-American and local dishes (her husband hates Puerto Rican cuisine).  She also looks contemptuously upon the local Mexicans and avoids them like the plague.</p>

<p>Skip, consider this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Vielle (an author) directs us to a Roman chronicle of an episode alleged to have occurred in the Gaulish war of 361 BC, in which an anonymous Gaulish warrior and the Roman general Titus Manlius met each other in single combat. Standing in the middle of a stream, the Gaul throws out a challenge, shouting with all his strength, and arousing great fear in the opposing army. When the challenge is accepted by Titus, the Gaul begans to contort himself &hellip;when the Gaul approaches him, he (Titus) dispatches him with one blow &hellip;  &#8221; The Tain: A Stunning New Translation of Ireland&rsquo;s Greatest Ancient Epic, Ciaran Carson, Viking Books, 2008, p. 213.   </p>
<p>The contortion is known as the &#8220;warp-spasm&#8221; and is very akin to the Viking &#8220;berserker&#8221; trance-state. When in the warp-spasm, a Celtic (Gaulish) warrior would strike abject fear into his enemies, and slay many foes, and even friends, if they perchance got in his way.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think Titus&rsquo; action was stupidity  &mdash;  I think it was putting his martial arts skills on the line, as a general should, if he truly has honor. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen examples of that. There is a Dominican woman in my office whose sister married an Irishman (from Ireland).  (They had met and were married in their Pentacostal church.)  All of their children, despite their Irish last name,  turned out looking just like dusky Dominicans rather than their father. The father in turn became &#8220;submerged&#8221; in the Dominican family and became, for all purposes, an honorary Dominican. He completely lost his white identity, and his children never had any.<br>

&ldquo;At one time, about one third of the population of Berlin was francophone (Hugenots fleeing Catherine of Medici).&rdquo;<br>
Anonymous at 8:20 PM<br>
_____</p>
<p>Berlin had a tiny francophone minority but one third of the population of Berlin was NEVER francophone. Do not exaggerate the facts.<br>
William Cutting<br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no exaggeration.   One must remember that Berlin  &mdash;    before the unification of Germany, and especially before Frederick the Great   &mdash;   was a small, remote, rather insignificant European capital. Even in Frederick&rsquo;s time, when Voltaire lived there he considered it akin to being in Siberia. Only after Germany was united in 1871 and Berlin became its capital, did Berlin grow explosively.</p>
<p>Before that time, yes, I can believe that a large influx of Huguenots would have constituted a good percentage of the otherwise small population.</p>
<p>1685   &mdash;   Edikt of Potsdam, 6000 Huguenots from France settle in Berlin. </p>
<p>1687   &mdash;   20% of the population are French </p>
<p>1700   &mdash;   The population had grown from about 6.000 at the end of the war, to about 20.000. </p>
<p>1746    &mdash;   an influx of Scottish people after Bonnie Prince Charlie&rsquo;s rebellion. </p>
<p>1750   &mdash;   population passed the 100,000 mark (including over 25,000 military personnel) <br>
<a href="https://bdaugherty.tripod.com/berlin/history.html" rel="nofollow">https://bdaugherty.tripod.com/berlin/history.html</a></p>
<p>The Thirty Years&rsquo; War between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged and the city lost half of its population.  Frederick William,  the &ldquo;Great Elector&rdquo;,  initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.  <br>
With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, he offered asylum to the French Huguenots. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately twenty percent of Berlin&rsquo;s residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. <br>

I have Howard Dodson, who wrote &#8220;Jubilee,&#8221; on tape stating&#8221;&hellip; this is why we must rewrite history.&#8221; and I am certain if anyone digs deep enough into the eighties and early nineties you will find Jesse Jackson, John Lewis, Andrew Young, Julian Bond etc, all of them liberals,  making essentially the same statement. Rewriting history is a liberal thing, it&rsquo;s what they do .And it destroys nations.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is a highly misleading article. There is nothing at all new here. The Anglo-Saxons and Celts, and the Scandinavians/Norse/Vikings were ethnically and culturally very closely related. In fact, the Anglo-Saxons could be described as &ldquo;proto-Vikings&rdquo;, coming to the country now known as England from part of the same area of north-western Europe as the Vikings, but 300 years earlier. Their languages were mutually intelligible - slightly different dialects of what was essentially the same language, in fact.<br>
Before their conversion to Christianity, the Anglo-Saxons worshipped the same pagan gods as the Vikings - Woden/Odin, Thunor/Thor, etc.<br>
It is not surprising that these two very similar communities were able to assimilate and integrate fairly easily.<br>
The very term, &ldquo;Viking&rdquo;, is, in itself, a misleading one. Strictly speaking, the &ldquo;vikings&rdquo; were the relatively small number of warriors/raiders/pirates operating out of Scandinavia from the 8th to the 11th century. The vast majority of Scandinavian immigrants to Britain during this period were not &ldquo;vikings&rdquo; as such, but farmers, craftsmen and merchants.<br>
As for - &ldquo;There is even evidence that suggests that Vikings adopted Christianity and intermarried with their English and Irish counterparts.&rdquo; - this is an insult to the intelligence. There is a huge volume of well established evidence that this is, of course, exactly what happened, not least the very existence of the modern English and Irish (not to mention the Scottish and Welsh) nations.</p>

Joe English, the Celts and the Anglo-Saxons are not related. The Anglo-Saxons are Germanics, the Vikings too. Germanic people are today the Germans, the Dutchmen, the Norwegians, the Swedes, the Icelanders, the Danes, the Englishmen.</p>
<p>The Celts are todays, Irishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen, Cornish and Bretons. </p>

			<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s comparing apples and pears. <br>
European immigrants to other European nations usually assimilated really well after a while. At one time, about one third of the population of Berlin was francophone (Hugenots fleeing Catherine of Medici). <br>
Unfortunately, in contrast to what is apparently implied here, <br>
it won&rsquo;t be anything like this with immigrants from such utterly different racial and cultural backgrounds. </p>

<p>Anonymous, your knowledge of History is very poor. The French Hugenots arrived in Berlin only from 1685 after the French king Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes.</p>

			<p>Let us remember too that Berlin was the Hauptstadt (capital) of Königreich Preußen, the Kingdom of Prussia, incorperated 1701,  the same year when Britain, with the Act of Union, became the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Thanks to Der Große König, Frederick the Great, the province and former fishing village of Berlin (that is what Berlin purportedly means in the Slavic Sorbian/Wend language) was turned into a major European and world power.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvPVDJbbZ7E&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvPVDJbbZ7E&feature;=related</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It means that it was possible for an agricultural state of few millions of inhabitants, on a small territory, without a fleet or direct maritime commerce, and with comparatively little manufacturing industry, to maintain, in some respects, the position of a great European power. Truly amazing.&#8221; </p>
<p>https://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Prussian_army.htm</p>
<p>Let us also remember that the German east during the late Middle Ages was sparsely populated and was in need of people to settle and develop it.  Frederick encouraged Europeans from many lands to come and help build the state during the Deutsche Ostsiedlung (March to the East).</p>
<p>As several posters already pointed out, many Huguenots came, since Berlin also served as kind of a sanctuary for Europe&rsquo;s Protestants.  The Huguenots were also preponderantly of Frankish, Teutonic blood.</p>
<p>Even northern Italians came and settled in Berlin, with a distinguished soldier by the name of Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprera de Montecuccoli (there is a name for you) becoming the second Deutscher Reichskanzler (chancellor) of the recently united German Reich following Otto von Bismarck.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi</a></p>
<p>So much for German/Prussian &#8220;intolerance&#8221;.</p>

			<p>There is a Dominican woman in my office whose sister married an Irishman (from Ireland). All of their children, despite their Irish last name, turned out looking just like dusky Dominicans rather than their father. The father in turn became &ldquo;submerged&rdquo; in the Dominican family and became, for all purposes, an honorary Dominican. He completely lost his white identity, and his children never had any.</p>

<p>On the bright side, his children will be more attractive, intelligent and ambitious than the typical Dominican.  On the negative side, this man&rsquo;s strong Celtic heritage going back thousands of years is lost forever.  Which race wins in this situation?!</p>
<p>This is why it is important for white parents to sit down with their children and explain why they need to marry within their race.  Our survival depends on it.  Explain that white genes are lost when we marry outside our race.  All we do is uplift other races with our good genes while we disappear as a people.  </p>
<p>If 100 years from now whites only make up 2% of the world, we will be in incredible danger.</p>

<p>Do you guys know anything about Dominicans and other Mestizos (aka &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;).  They already have fairly significant amounts of White genes from the Iberian Spanish and Portuguese, and they neither have been nor are any more &#8216;uplifted&rsquo; due to this than when thy further mix with us here.  </p>
<p>Their African and/or Indian side of the gene pool always seems to keep things with them, genetically, status-quo.</p>
<p>So it actually is a lose-lose proposition for everyone after all.</p>

<p>The early English DID worship Woden, Thor, etc.(hence WEDNESday,THURSday, etc.) before they were converted to Christianity.</p>
<p>Hengist and Horsa were semi-legendary leaders of the initial Anglo-Saxon landings at Thanet, Kent (near Ramsgate) in the fifth century AD, NOT Gods.</p>

			<p>It is my understanding that the Celts were in central Europe, and that, with the coming of the Germanics, the two tribes converged.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be Celtics who did not converge, but it would seem to me that many Germanics are also Celtic, to some degree.</p>
<p>An interesting aside  &mdash;  my daughter goes to school in England. We had a video conference (via computer) with her. She introduced two charming English young ladies. I asked them whether they were Anglo-Saxon or Celtic. They answered immediately, &#8220;We&rsquo;re Anglo-Saxon!&#8221; They way they answered told me that Anglo-Saxons do not think too much of Celtics!  </p>

			<p>&#8220;(Hugenots fleeing Catherine of Medici).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine of medici had every right to destroy the Hugenots.  They were terrorist revolutionaries.  The Hugenot aristocrats came to Paris for a royal wedding.  They planned to murder every member of the royal family and every catholic aristocrat and high ranking government official in and around Paris and then take over the government.</p>
<p>One of the Hugenot leaders, Admiral de Coligny thought things over and betrayed the plot to Queen Catherine.  The Hugenots had armed themselves and planned to murder the catholics at night when they were asleep.  Many royal guards were involved in the plot.  Had the Hugenots succeeded, hundreds of Catholic royals, aristocrats in Paris for the wedding, and government officials would have been murdered.</p>
<p>Queen Catherine and Admiral Coligny turned the tables on the Hugenots.  The Hugenot guards were replaced with loyal guards.  When the Hugenot assassins snuck into the Catholic&rsquo;s homes and bedrooms after midnight they were quickly killed. </p>
<p>Nothing wrong with killing someone who comes into your home in the middle of the night to murder you and your family.</p>
<p>Good for Catherine.  Too bad our own leaders can&rsquo;t defend our people and our culture against the subersives who have been invading since the 1880&rsquo;s when the Emma Goldman Leon Cologycz crew arrived.</p>
<p>By the way, the Hugenot religion was subsidized by the Kings of Spain as a way of causing division and unrest in France. The Edict of Nantes did not end religious freedom for the Hugenots.  All it did was end the Hugenot seperate militia armies ready and willing to serve the Kings of Spain should they wish to invade.</p>
<p>The reason so many Hugenots left France around the end of the 17th century was because of protective tariffs and protectionist manufacturing policies.  Many Hugenots made a living in textile manufacturing of cotton fabrics.  Cotton cannot be grown in France.</p>
<p>At the time, Europe&rsquo;s only source of cotton was India, in the British areas.  Britian controlled the cotton trade of the world.</p>
<p>France was a protectionist nation at the time, anxious to protect its linen, wool and silk producers.  So the manufacture and even use of British Indian cotton was outlawed.  The Hugenot cotton manufacturers and importers left because of economic reasons.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with defending your own life, your children&rsquo;s lives and your country against terrorists in the pay of a foreign power. Good for Catherine and Coligny!!!!!</p>

			<p><i>Here in the US we&rsquo;ve always had the Anglo Saxon&rsquo;s version of history and of course that history was revered. [..] Florence and Venice were the centers of the Italian renaissance and who cannot deny the beauty of the arts that flourished in that region. The Florence dome by Brunoleschi was quite an achievement for its time. They are hardly slouches in contributing to European civilization.</i></p>
<p>Someone correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but wouldn&rsquo;t the people of Northern Italy during the time of the Renaissance have been ethnically German? After the fall of the Roman Empire, and the chaos of the migrations, Northern Italy was occupied by a Germanic tribe called the Lombards.</p>
