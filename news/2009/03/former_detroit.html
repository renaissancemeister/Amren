			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, South Florida Times (Miami), March 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He travels in his own Boeing 737. He won a $240 million verdict against Disney. He &#8220;can&rsquo;t stand to lose.&#8221; And he&rsquo;s on the job for former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the &#8220;giant killer,&#8221; attorney Willie E. Gary, who filed a lawsuit for Kilpatrick this week against Skytel over steamy text messages that helped bring the mayor down.</p>
<p>Gary&rsquo;s Web site notes that he&rsquo;s won more than 150 cases where awards or settlements were more than $1 million each. That&rsquo;s good news for Kilpatrick. His legal victories have been few.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gary&rsquo;s law firm has opulent headquarters along the St. Lucie River in Stuart, about 100 miles north of Miami. He has a 50-room mansion in Stuart. His custom jetliner, &#8220;Wings of Justice II,&#8221; seats 32 and subs as an office in the air.</p>
<p>Gary wouldn&rsquo;t say how much the plane cost, but said he poured $11 million into refurbishing and decorating the interior. The work includes an 18-karat gold sink, leather seats, carpeting and a $1.2 million sound system.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also the chairman of the Black Family Channel, a 24-hour cable channel billed as being devoted to &#8220;family values&#8221; programming aimed at urban viewers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now a millionaire &#8220;many times over,&#8221; he says he was raised poor and picked crops in southern migrant farming communities. He got a degree in business administration from Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C., where he was co-captain of the football team, and went on to earn his law degree at North Carolina Central University in Durham, N.C.</p>
<p>Gary says the $100 million demand he made to Skytel &#8220;could go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t stand to lose,&#8221; he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got to outwork the opponent. I don&rsquo;t think there is a lawyer in America that is going to outwork Willie Gary.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All Attorney Gary has to do to win the $100 million is to find<br>
a town where you can get an all Black jury. Case closed. Detroit would be prime territory to have this trial since no Detroit jury would be anything short of all Black, and are sure to vote for the plaintiff, no questions asked.</p>

<p>About Detroit&rsquo;s &#8220;beautiful&#8221; ruins. Mostly ruined by that dysfunctional subpopulation known as &#8220;Afro-Americans.&#8221; Wonder if a psychologist, or even a sociologist can lucidly explain the mentality of Blacks. Who can&rsquo;t exist without literally trying to destroy everything they see around them.</p>
<p>Actually, Detroit is not the only city thoroughly trashed by its Black population. Huge parts of Philadelphia (West and North Philly), Camden, Newark, Baltimore&hellip; and the list goes on and on. </p>

<p>That was a great site, many look like the pictures I have of 5 years in Iraq/Afghanistan with the only difference being that (particularly Iraq) these U.S. cities are more dangerous and Iraq is being rebuilt!!!</p>

		<p>Friend &#8220;Strider&#8221;, you can do equally telling photo essays about virtually ANY city with a large Black population. I grew up in Philly. Worked in West Philly&hellip; which was once a beautiful part of what was formerly a great American city. Seeing what vandalism and destruction these creatures can commit is absolutely incredible. Those ruins of what were once beautiful homes and mansions in West Philly&hellip; before WWII and the massive incursion of southern Blacks.</p>
<p>The incredible part is that Blacks act that way, NO MATTER WHERE IN THE WORLD THEY ARE! In Europe, crime (and vandalism) by Blacks is as commonplace as it is in the Black African countries. Zimbabwe, for example. Once the breadbasket of Africa is the most dismal hellhole in the hellhole we call Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>I would LOVE to see any psychologist try to present a rational, lucid explanation of how and WHY Blacks are the way they are. Blaming their sociopathic mentality on slavery and &#8216;discrmnashun&rsquo; can only go so far. Sooner or later you have to look at these people themselves. That those pathetic efforts to &#8216;excuse&rsquo; their mentality just doen&rsquo;t wash.</p>
<p>Take the practice of Blacks to loot and riot for the slightest of reasons. As happened during the New York City Power Outage a couple of decades ago. Would Whites ever act like that for ANY reason?</p>

<p>The odd thing about the black&rsquo;s inclination to riot, loot, rob and burn is that when they are outraged, they do all of this IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. I lived in Watts and Compton when they did it.</p>
