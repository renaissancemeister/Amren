<h1>Illegals Solution Long Overdue</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James H. Walsh, Newsmax, March 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack Obama won the U.S. presidency because of a majority of the Hispanic vote in California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico and large numbers of Hispanic votes in Illinois, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Nationally, he received 67 percent of the Hispanic voting population.</p>
<p>Though politically incorrect to mention, U.S. election officials have looked the other way, during the past decade, as a non-citizen voting element multiplied in the United States. Not all Hispanics voting in U.S. elections are U.S. citizens, and that is the sad truth. These illegal voters now expect quid-pro-quo returns from President Obama, including open borders, blanket amnesty, and amnesty-related healthcare.</p>
<p>Although surveys show that 75 percent of U.S. citizens are against amnesty, the Obama administration has no intention of allowing angry U.S. citizens to derail yet another prime piece of permissive immigration legislation, as was the fate of the 2007 McCain-Kennedy bill. President Obama, when addressing the nation&rsquo;s immigration woes, suggests off-the-cuff amnesty for illegal aliens. On March 18, 2009, in California, the president re-affirmed his stance on &#8220;pathway to citizenship,&#8221; as if saying would make it so. Whether he believes that blanket amnesty legislation will come to pass is another matter, but meanwhile he plays to his base. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Where do illegal aliens fit in the 47 million men, women, and children in the United States alleged to have no health insurance? Of this 47 million, nearly 40 percent are described as U.S. citizens, who refuse, for various reasons, to be forced into any healthcare program. Another 20 percent are U.S. citizens seeking health insurance. The remaining 40 percent of the alleged uninsured are thought to be non-citizens, many in this country illegally.</p>
<p>The total number of illegal aliens currently in the United States, as estimated by liberal think tanks, is approximately 12 million to 20 million. A closer look at federal apprehensions of illegal aliens at U.S. borders (Mexican, Canadian, Atlantic, Pacific, and inland ports of entry at U.S. airports) suggests that the total number of illegal aliens in the United States may be closer to 38 million men, women, and children.</p>
<p>Any count of this ghost population remains a guesstimate; but illegal aliens do become visible through their documented consumption of public benefits such as healthcare.</p>
<p>As unemployment rates increase among U.S. citizens, resentment is growing toward illegal aliens who take not only jobs but health care benefits  &mdash;  at taxpayer expense. Illegal aliens present an interesting dilemma for the Obama administration and open border advocates. Indications are that most illegal aliens receive pay in cash, and thus healthcare contributions by employers are non-existent, feeding the employer&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When candidate McCain failed to deliver on his &#8220;pathway to citizenship&#8221; candidate Obama promised amnesty. Hispanic voters weighed the odds for blanket amnesty with all the rights of citizenship and marked their ballots for Obama.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the cost of illegal immigration to the U.S. taxpayer is estimated at $346 billion annually and rising. Education and related healthcare are among the escalating costs, with one-fourth of students (K-12) in the United States now Hispanic. In Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas, more than half the students in grades 1-12 are Hispanic.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens are becoming alarmed by daily accounts of crimes committed by illegal aliens, who receive light sentences, a deportment waiver, and healthcare.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s recent effort to place the Census Bureau within the White House was an ill-advised power grab and blatant attempt to legitimize (without legislation) the ghost population of illegal aliens residing in the United States. New York City, a sanctuary city, is lobbying for the 2010 census to include illegal aliens. New York City pays millions of dollars for social/welfare benefits, including healthcare, for illegal aliens and their extended families. The economic recession is impacting the generosity of New York and other sanctuary cities and states that previously felt compelled to encourage and protect illegal aliens. Because of its sanctuary spending, California now faces bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>I remember a prop that was passed overwhelmingly by the taxpayers of California to stop the giveaways to the illegals.  One liberal judge overruled it with one fell swoop!   I was stunned,  hundreds of thousands voted FOR the bill, and ONE LIBERAL judge threw it out.   I was in Watsonville, a heavily hispanic area, and there was a sign in the window that the prop was &#8220;racist&#8221;.  So you don&rsquo;t want to give  your money through taxes to the illegals, so that makes you racist.  </p>

			<p>I only hope that Knucklehead Newsom is not our next governor. He would make Kaliffornia a sanctuary state, and invite millions of more illegals to bleed our system dry and further overpopulate it.</p>

			<p>I have one simple question: why should American citizens recognize the legitimacy or competency of officials of whatever level or branch of government if they are &#8220;elected&#8221; on the basis of fraudulent &#8220;votes&#8221; by aliens?  Are not such people usurping tyrants rather than lawful officials of a republican (small &#8220;r&#8221;) government?</p>

<p>Well Anonymous, you are everyone, everywhere and both sexes..  There ought to be a ban on using the name Anonymous as it is clearly being used to post fraudulent comments, even if we agree with them.</p>
<p>The Proposition was 189 and it passed during the tenure of Pete Wilson, California&rsquo;s last Republican governor.  La Raza and Mecha filed lawsuits and had the Attorney General overturn the law - NOT one lone liberal judge.<br>

			<p>There are so many poor people in Mexico who do not have health insurance.  Also families are large in Mexico, while wages are low.  One way that Americans can alleviate this problem is to bring all the poor Mexicans to the USA and give them jobs.  Americans can also help by becoming unemployed, thus opening up a job for a needy Mexican Citizen.  Also, Americans need to pay substantially more taxes so that the government can provide health insurance to these poor Mexican Citizens (as well as education, food stamps, housing vouchers, welfare, affirmative action programs, etc. etc.).  Of course that will result in less income for your family, but perhaps you can manage by not having children or not sending your kids to college or maybe not fixing your house or having that expensive operation.  America needs to tighten its belt.  And that&rsquo;s just for Mexican Citizens, let alone Haitians, Somalians, etc. etc.  </p>

<p>Thank god someone else gets the true cost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a simple math equation. 300 million Americans divided by the federal budget equals 10,000 collected directly or indirectly from each American. Add in the cost of state and local  governments and you get about 15K per individual. If illegals don&rsquo;t earn enough to support their share of government expense (60k for a family of 4) then they must be indirectly and directly subsidized. No different than if your roommate rented half your house for $100 while you paid $1000 for the mortgage. Liberals would tell you the renter is adding to your wealth. We know better.</p>

<p>It looks like you haven&rsquo;t much of a choice.  The person that wins the Democrat nomination will be Governor, that&rsquo;s pretty much a given.  So it&rsquo;s pretty much Newsom, Jerry Brown, Jack O&rsquo;Connell and DiFi.</p>
<p>Jerry Brown is what he is, O&rsquo;Connell says that black and Hispanic low academic performance is the fault of white teachers, and DiFi, well, you know.  Pick your poison.</p>

			<p>The article fails to mention the important part.  The other side of the coin so to speak.  The estimated cost of rounding up every single last one of those illegals and kicking them out of our country is a measly $230 billion dollars spread over 5 years.  Even by conservative estimates, such a plan would pay for itself in saved costs, the very first year and rapidly save far more than the costs every year afterward.  The amount save is so large, that afterward our economy would experience an incredible boom, the likes of which never seen before.  Add to this the FACT that 3/4 of all people, in BOTH parties WANT this done and all by itself, Obama&rsquo;s inaction is grounds for impeachment if not outright overthrow.  There is no legitimate reason whatsoever to not do this&hellip;..IMMEDIATELY.  None.  The people want it.  The republicans want it.  The democrats want it.  And so do the hispanics (afterall, it is OUR neighborhoods these jackals target for crime&hellip;.OUR families that suffer most).</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the pro-illegal traitors in this country want to sell us out for any or all of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. votes<br>
2. payoffs<br>
3. they hate America and want to destroy it</p>
<p>Anyone want to add to the list?</p>

			<p>It appears the US Gov is working for the fraudulent illegals, the Non-allied Narco Mexican gov. and tax cheats.  I am afraid of massive slaughter at US borden when National Guard is assigned without proper equipment.  I have never felt more unsafe or betrayed by the US government. I am forced to pay taxes to the continue the betrayal of US Consitituion and the American people.  All government servants need to be audited and required a drug test every year.  My retirement is gone and all I worked for my entire life is given to liars, cheats and thieves.  This is all complements of governments giving away my tax money to foreign interests.  When the government places ICE agents at all welfare offices and denies foreign births welfare/medical/food I will know honesty has returned.  Until then it is clear I am being fraudulently betrayed.  V</p>
