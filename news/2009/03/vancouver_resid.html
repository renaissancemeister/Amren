<h1>Vancouver Residents Fear Gang Violence As City Prepares to Host 2010 Winter Games</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Hainsworth, AP, March 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With its spectacular bay and stunning, snowcapped peaks, Vancouver easily ranks as one of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful cities. But in recent months, the people of Canada&rsquo;s Olympic city have been living in fear.</p>
<p>Even as Vancouver prepares to host the 2010 Winter Games, its crime rate is going up. Since January alone, there have been 45 shootings in the region, 17 of them fatal. There were 58 murders last year in this region of 2.7 million people, up from 41 the year before, according to the regional Integrated Homicide Investigation Team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The root of the problem seems to be drugs, or rather a shortage of them.</p>
<p>The Mexican cocaine supply line extends through the United States, especially Los Angeles, up to Vancouver, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Pat Fogarty. But now the Mexican government of President Felipe Calderon has mobilized 45,000 soldiers and 5,000 federal police to curb cartel activity. That has driven up the price of cocaine in Vancouver from $23,300 per kilogram to almost $39,000, Fogarty says, and gangs are killing each other.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harper has said people planning to attend the Winter Games should not worry about violence, with 15,000 police officers, private security and military personnel expected to provide security.</p>
<p>But shopkeeper Nandal Oad disagrees. He says nobody should feel safe coming to the Games.</p>
<p>Oad&rsquo;s suburban convenience store is just across the street from where shots were fired over morning rush-hour traffic March 10, leaving two brothers aged 19 and 22 dead. The violence has spread far beyond the city&rsquo;s notoriously drug-infested Downtown Eastside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vancouver police Chief Jim Chu acknowledged the city is in the middle of a &#8220;brutal&rsquo;&#8221; gang war, and said the strategy is to detain gang members on as many charges as possible. However, some of those arrested are being released on bail by the courts.</p>
<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s mayor, Gregor Robertson, has offered his own blunt assessment: Police are fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>Vancouver may in part be paying the price for some of the very features that help make it so attractive. Rob Gordon, director of the criminology school at British Columbia&rsquo;s Simon Fraser University, noted that the city has a laid-back attitude, easy access to the U.S. border and a vast backcountry with a climate ripe for growing potent marijuana. Police say British Columbia marijuana, known as B.C. bud, is often traded for cocaine, and Vancouver is known for marijuana grow-ops, or growing operations.</p>

			<p>For years and years, we heard anti-gun libs compare Vancouver and Seattle, in their minds the difference was gun control.  The real answer is that Seattle has many blacks and Hispanics, Vancouver (at the time) had almost none.  Looks like that&rsquo;s changing, and the anti-gun libs won&rsquo;t bring it up anymore.</p>

			<p>  I don&rsquo;t get it. I thought Canada celebrated its wonderful diversity? Gee, you mean there might be a downfall to all their uncontrolled nonwhite immigration? Wow! who would have thought such a thing could happen in Canada? Maybe they need more blacks to even out the muslims and asians. Maybe whitey is the cause of all the trouble, yeah, it must be whiteys fault, whom else could possibly be to blame?</p>

			<p>  Well, thank God Canada disarmed all the white people. You can&rsquo;t have them defending themselves against these wonderfully diverse gangs of &#8220;youths&#8221;.  Canada has literally committed suicide. Another massacre chalked up by stupid liberals.</p>

			<p>Does this mean we are expected to believe that these gangs are composed of the white &#8220;racists&#8221; who post anonymously to the websites that recently so upset Canukistani authorities?  </p>
<p>I have a solution: Midnight ice-hockey.</p>
<p>Midnight basketball worked so well here in the states, after all.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing perfectly straight before we go any further.  This situation is just a minor side item to the strength diversity gives vancouver.</p>
<p>Yes, crime is out of control, and the city used to have a very low crime rate before the push for diversity, but you have to consider that diversity more than benefits the residents, in spite of the high rate of crime, because&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, because&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..it&rsquo;s a STRENGTH.  Yes, that&rsquo;s why.  It&rsquo;s a strength.</p>
<p>Just stop and realize how weak and deprived the city was before diversity.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

			<p>When Vancouver was an almost all-White city it was very safe. Now thanks to Trudeau and his open door immigration ethnic gangs have gone on a crime spree.</p>

			<p>I live in the area, and as the shade of the city gets darker, so does the crime. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

			<p>This will be nothing compared to the World Cup of Soccer being played in South Africa.  2010 should be a riot!! (Pun intended)</p>

<p>There are still practically no blacks in Vancouver, these gangs are probably Asian, Indian and Hispanic.</p>

			<p>I too live in the Vancouver area, and I agree as the racial makeup of the city diversified the crime statistic went up. This gang war that is supposedly responsible for the shootings is, of course, drug related. One of the gangs involved is called the UN gang and is comprised of men from all different nationalities (East Indian, White, Hispanic, Asian, Black). The UN gang is led by the Bacon brothers who are white and they come from what appears to be a decent middle class home (nice house, parents are professional people). The other gang in this drug, turf war is an Asian gang made up of mostly Chinese. </p>
<p>When the Philiponis(sp) and the Bacedas(sp) ran organized crime in Vancouver you never heard about anything and felt very safe.  </p>

			<p>Gang murders in Vancouver are committed mostly by Asian Indians, Chinese and various SE Asians.  </p>
