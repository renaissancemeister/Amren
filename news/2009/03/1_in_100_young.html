				One in 100 black men and women develops heart failure before age 50, according to one of the first long-term studies to look at the life-threatening condition in younger adults.
			</p>
			<p>
				The research suggests blacks in that age group suffer the condition at a rate 20 times higher than whites do &mdash; an astounding difference more pronounced than earlier studies had indicated.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, those findings are based on a very small number of heart failure cases, the authors said, so more study is needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The takeaway message is that doctors should be more aggressive about treating young blacks who may be at risk, some experts said.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				In the new study, the researchers looked at data from more than 5,100 blacks and whites in Chicago; Minneapolis; Birmingham, Ala.; and Oakland, Calif. The participants were ages 18 to 30 at the time they joined the study more than 20 years ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the years, 27 people developed heart failure by age 50 and all but one were black. Five people died, all of those black.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the outset, blood pressure levels and weights were similar, no matter which race, said Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist at the University of California at San Francisco.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the researchers found that a disproportionate number of blacks developed high blood pressure in their young adulthood and went on to suffer heart failure. Blacks also were more likely to develop diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and to suffer an impairment in the heart muscle&rsquo;s ability to contract.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s not clear why more blacks develop those problems so early, Bibbins-Domingo said. Possible explanations range from income and social environment to genetics, she added.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another mystery: Researchers told those who were diagnosed with high blood pressure to see their doctors about it. But 10 years into the study, the condition was untreated or poorly controlled in 3 out of 4 black patients diagnosed.

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Background </b>The antecedents and epidemiology of heart failure in young adults are poorly understood.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Methods </b>We prospectively assessed the incidence of heart failure over a 20-year period among 5115 blacks and whites of both sexes who were 18 to 30 years of age at baseline. Using Cox models, we examined predictors of hospitalization or death from heart failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Results </b>Over the course of 20 years, heart failure developed in 27 participants (mean [±SD] age at onset, 39±6 years), all but 1 of whom were black. The cumulative incidence of heart failure before the age of 50 years was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.7) in black women, 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.4) in black men, 0.08% (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.5) in white women, and 0% (95% CI, 0 to 0.4) in white men (P=0.001 for the comparison of black participants and white participants). Among blacks, independent predictors at 18 to 30 years of age of heart failure occurring 15 years, on average, later included higher diastolic blood pressure (hazard ratio per 10.0 mm Hg, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.1), higher body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) (hazard ratio per 5.7 units, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hazard ratio per 13.3 mg per deciliter [0.34 mmol per liter], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.0), and kidney disease (hazard ratio, 19.8; 95% CI, 4.5 to 87.2). Three quarters of those in whom heart failure subsequently developed had hypertension by the time they were 40 years of age. Depressed systolic function, as assessed on a study echocardiogram when the participants were 23 to 35 years of age, was independently associated with the development of heart failure 10 years, on average, later (hazard ratio for abnormal systolic function, 36.9; 95% CI, 6.9 to 198.3; hazard ratio for borderline systolic function, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 10.2). Myocardial infarction, drug use, and alcohol use were not associated with the risk of heart failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Conclusions </b>Incident heart failure before 50 years of age is substantially more common among blacks than among whites. Hypertension, obesity, and systolic dysfunction that are present before a person is 35 years of age are important antecedents that may be targets for the prevention of heart failure.

					Strange isn&rsquo;t it, how the media touts Black Track &amp; Field runners as being virtual &#8216;Supermen&rsquo; and how their victories in long distance events are due to their inherent superiority over Whites in events that demand high cardiovascular endurance, yet Blacks have a high heart failure rate? Could it be from doing too many drugs &mdash; the illegal kind &mdash; that is? Could it be from being so obese? Could it be from eating all those McDLT&rsquo;s? Or could it be the evil White man&rsquo;s racism causing so much stress on the poor dears &mdash; racism like affirmative action for example?

			</p>
			<p>
				Laughing Out Loud!
			</p>
			<p>
				This is simply Mother Nature&rsquo;s way of balancing out the criminal propensities and globularness gorging habits of blacks, when compared to whites. Whites produce far more than they consume; blacks (aside from stupidity to atrocity) produce nothing, but consume like Biblical locust swarms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sooner or later, equilibrium must be achieved!!!

				&#8220;1 in 100 Young Blacks Has Heart Failure.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				But you have to understand this is because they don&rsquo;t drink, smoke dope, maintain healthy eating habits and exercise.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s directly due to white racism.

				Has anybody conducting this &#8220;study&#8221; noticed the incidence of gross obesity or drug abuse among black versus whites?
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, never mind.

				I can name an organ that, unfortunately, nevers seems to fail and another organ that has a much higher failure rate than their heart ; by context and societal experience by Original-Americans( Euro-Stock ), there is no ambiguity in my statement.

			</p>
			<p>
				I suggest again that the endemic higher rates of blood pressure and heart failure among blacks is primarily due to their life-long internal realization (resulting in permanent physiological tension and stress) that they will forever be unable to truly belong with, or effectively compete among, whites.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hence the attempt to create a separate &#8220;black culture&#8221; as an emotional escape from that inescapable realization.
			</p>
			<p>
				Has anyone yet thought about why humanity originally grew into distinct races and tribes across the world? It had first of all to do with a certain and secure sense of common acceptance.

				Alcoholism, drug use, unhealthy instant food, black skin which prevents Vitamin D production, biochemically predisposed to live hard, die young (?) about sums up the possible and probable explanations.

				That&rsquo;s a pretty shocking study. I read somewhere that many health problems of blacks are due to the large amount of salt in American diets which is hard for their bodies to handle because they came from a region of the world were salt was scarce. Also, I&rsquo;m sure the large amount of fast food that blacks consume and the extremely high rates of obesity amongst their women doesn&rsquo;t help things either.
