				3 Officers Dead, Suspect Killed in Oakland, Calif.

				Three Oakland police officers and a suspect are dead, and another officer is in grave condition, after two related shootings on Saturday, the first after a traffic stop and the second after a massive manhunt ended in gunfire, police said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two officers were shot in the first incident just after 1 p.m. after they stopped a suspect&rsquo;s vehicle in east Oakland, said Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason.
			</p>
			<p>
				The suspect fled the scene on foot into a nearby neighborhood, police said, leading to an intense manhunt by dozens of Oakland police, California Highway Patrol officers and Alameda County sheriff deputies. Streets were roped off and an entire area of east Oakland closed to traffic.
			</p>
			<p>
				At about 3:30 p.m. officers, acting on an anonymous tip, found the suspect, who had barricaded himself in an apartment building, police said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Police said the suspect, 27-year-old Lovelle Mixon, of Oakland, fired an assault rifle at officers who came into the building to arrest him. Two officers were killed and a third was grazed by a bullet, police said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Acting Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan said police returned fire, killing Mixon.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Hours after Saturday&rsquo;s shootings near a busy intersection just blocks from a police substation in east Oakland, people were still at the scene of the first shooting as police tape blocked off streets.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Tension between police and the community has risen steadily since the fatal shooting of unarmed 22-year-old Oscar Grant by a transit police officer at an Oakland train station on Jan. 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				On Saturday afternoon, about 20 people taunted police near the scene of the first shooting.

				</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Demian Bulwa, Jaxon Van Derbeken, et al., San Francisco Chronicle, March 23, 2009</i></font>
				</p>
				<p>
					A fourth Oakland police officer was pronounced dead Sunday in the wake of a shooting rampage by a 26-year-old parolee who, according to family members, knew he was a wanted man and did not want to go back to prison.
				</p>
				<p>
					Motorcycle officer John Hege, 41, was declared brain dead Sunday morning at Highland Hospital in Oakland and remained on life support to preserve his organs for donation.
				</p>
				<p>
					His death made Saturday&rsquo;s shootings in East Oakland the deadliest attacks on California law enforcement in almost four decades.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					The chaotic shootout occurred in a darkened apartment filled with smoke from officers&rsquo; nonlethal shock grenades and dust from bullets ripping through drywall. It ended when SWAT team officers returned fired and killed Mixon, authorities said.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					Law enforcement authorities revealed Sunday that Mixon had been investigated last year in another homicide case in Alameda County. Details of that slaying were not immediately released, but prosecutors found there was not enough evidence to charge him.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Outburst puzzles police</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Oakland investigators said they were not aware of Mixon&rsquo;s possible connection to the earlier slaying. They said they were perplexed about what triggered Mixon&rsquo;s sudden outburst of violence against their officers.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;This is a strange one,&#8221; said Oakland police Capt. Steve Tull, who is overseeing the investigation. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t know what his motivation is.&#8221; If authorities found he had violated the conditions of his parole, Mixon would have faced at most six months in prison, Tull said.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mixon &#8220;weighed six months&#8221; against his own life and the lives of the officers, Tull said.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;He&rsquo;s not a monster,&#8221; said [Mixon&rsquo;s] sister, 24-year-old Enjoli Mixon, who said her 4-year-old daughter&rsquo;s bedroom in a small apartment on 74th Avenue was the scene of much of the bloodshed. It was there, police said, where Mixon fired through a closet wall at a team of SWAT officers, who then shot and killed him. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want people to think he&rsquo;s a monster. He&rsquo;s just not. He&rsquo;s just not.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Assault conviction in 2002</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Lovelle Mixon was convicted in 2002 of assault with a deadly weapon after an armed robbery in San Francisco, family members said. He served time in San Francisco County Jail and Corcoran State Prison. He had been released on parole in 2007, then was sent back to prison for nine months in 2008 after he had violated his parole. His attorney in the assault case, Lisa DewBerry, declined comment Sunday.
				</p>
				<p>
					His family said that while he was behind bars, Mixon married his childhood girlfriend, Amara Langston, and worked briefly as a janitor in Hayward once he got out. He was most recently released from prison in November, his family said.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, about three weeks ago, Mixon skipped a home visit from his parole officer, his family said. Mixon&rsquo;s grandmother said he had gotten angry at his parole officer because the agent had missed earlier appointments. {snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;We did pick him up previously, (and) he has been looked at as a suspect in other serious crimes,&#8221; Hinkle said. &#8220;He was a suspect in a murder, but due to lack of evidence, on a homicide, he was charged with other violations.&#8221;

				The last time something this bad hppened in Oakland was in 1974. Two police officers were investigating a suspicious intruder in a school. They were told (by who, I dont know) to not draw their guns.The suspect, a black male, ran out from behind them and grabbed bolth of their guns, and killed bolth of them.As he was being led away, he said to the news cameras that he was a black angel, and that the white devils had killed him.He did not die, I am sorry to say.

				No, he didn&rsquo;t. He was a guerilla and acted according to his military instincts, as he understood them. Oakland has seen numerous instances of alleged police brutality, hyped by the press (of course) and this is a revenge killing. It has been a warzone for years.
			</p>

				Change the rules of engagement. Fire the sociologists. Hire generals. Arm the ground police with what they need and arm the helicopters also.

				Michael Savage suggests that Oakland, being the good &#8220;progressive&#8221; Bay Area city that it is, has really restrictive rules of engagement for its cops. They could have been to blame partially for these cops getting murdered.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have worried for a long time that there would be organized efforts on the part of blacks, AQ-financed, to snipe at white cops. Mainly AQ would want to destabilize the U.S. internally so that American military resources would be diverted away from the Middle East to American inner cities, and black drug gang thugs would benefit by removing an obstacle to their &#8220;trade.&#8221; I doubt this was an organized and deliberate sniping, just some usual ghetto suspect who didn&rsquo;t want to be taken to prison. But the comments on that Ghetto Bragging Rights makes me wonder.

				I am a liberal who has been hearing for decades about how &#8220;racist&#8221; white Americans are.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stories like the above have persuaded me that if we white Americans really were racist, we would have dealt with berserk levels of black crime 50 years ago by throwing up some razor wire around the ghettos and geting on with our lives.

				He served only five years for assault with a deadly weapon during an armed robbery?
			</p>

				The liberals will no doubt blame the firearm that was illegally possessed by this felon.

			<p>
				Well, we all know how the police in a rational society would have responded to the hooting and chirping primates; with one massive warning volley over their heads. After that, a more corrective application of firepower would be in order, if they did not disperse.
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe then, they would not be so brutishly &#8220;mirthful&#8221; about killing human beings in law enforcement?

				No, in black parlance, he was just misunderstood and by shooting 4 officers to death, he just &#8220;messed up&#8221;. Other than that, why he was just an upstanding citizen and role model for his community.

				&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know what his motivation is.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Given that Lovelle Mixon was black and all of his victims were white, might we just hazard a wild guess that the killings were racially motivated? A city like Oakland has to have its share of black police officers, but none of them were shot. Fancy that!
			</p>
			<p>
				Television news didn&rsquo;t waste much time on this story. What&rsquo;s a few more white sheep slaughtered by a black male? Best to keep quiet so as not to wake up clueless whites to the idea of black hunters and white prey. I protested the lack of coverage in an e-mail to Fox News, but next time, and the time after, and the time after that, it will be the same way. They&rsquo;ll try to keep the lid on for as long as possible because they&rsquo;re terrified of the day the lid may blow off.

				I&rsquo;ve read a few articles about this slaying and a few stated that the residents of the apartment complex where he hid where aware that he was there and that the police were looking fo him, but did not call the police for fear of being labelled a &#8220;snitch&#8221;. Had some one called earlier, he may have not had time to prepare for the SWAT team&rsquo;s arrival, and two officers lives may have been spared.

				What&rsquo;s the story on GhettoBraggingRights, anyway? I was under the impression that it was either a prank or some kind of false flag thing to stir up racial tensions, but either way, I think it&rsquo;s incredibly dangerous and irresponsible, especially in light of this Black Foot Soldiers thing, which I just saw yesterday, in response to the Oakland murders. Absolutely chilling. I don&rsquo;t think many black thugs have the grasp of the English language or design smarts to put together sites like these, but real or fake, this Black Foot Soldier thing has the potential to go viral in the thug population, giving a name and a cause to the random acts of violent criminality they&rsquo;ve been committing all along. The Crips and the Bloods started out as an even more childish and ignorant imitation of the Black Panthers&rsquo; dimly grasped Marxist/Maoist politics and spread to most major cities within 15 years, and that was without the internet and the widespread popularity of Hip Hop to spread it along. This could be ten times worse. I generally don&rsquo;t like censorship of any kind, but these guys really need to be shut down. Inciting a riot? They&rsquo;re inciting an all out war.

				Authorities tried to figure out why Mixon would ccmmit such a crime? Are they serious?! How about, &#8220;He was an urban black with poor impulse control and a string of felony offenses for which he&rsquo;d already served time, and he knew that he was in violation of his parole, and besides, the news media had made a huge deal out of the shooting death of another black by a White officer in Oakland in January, so Mixon may have decided to &#8216;get revenge&rsquo; on the police.&#8221; That reason enough for them?
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the fact that there are always a certain number of blacks who see Whites as &#8220;fair game&#8221; because of slavery, segregation, poverty, racism, ad nauseum. And White policemen are viewed by them as an especially deserving target.

				I&rsquo;am a law enforcement officer working in San Francisco.
			</p>
			<p>
				I know exactly what this is about. It was a well set up amubush, something the blacks have been doing for decades. Set up the ambush. Then a black drives around the area committing gross traffic offenses such as driving on the wrong side of the street, blowing through red lights and speeding 30 miles over the speed limit.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the driver is stopped, the first police officers are shot. Others arrive and are shot by well placed snipers. The murderers run off.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is exactly what that Mumbia Abu Jamal or whatever he calls himself did to officer Danny Falkner back in Philly decades ago. Mumbia&rsquo;s borther drove his taxi cab through a red light over and over until an officer came along and stopped him for a ticket. Mumbia shot officer Falkner from ambush.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mumbia mumbo is now a great hero to the liberals, especially to the older liberals who were revolutionaries at the time. Those liberals now run the government through their puppet Pres. Obama
			</p>
			<p>
				This happened a lot in the sixties and seventies when the liberals and their black puppets were at war with America.
			</p>
			<p>
				Seems it is still going on. This being Oakland, the accused, if ever caught will never be convicted. When and if they are caught there will be massive demonstrations and threats of riots if they are convicted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Communist black Mayor Ron Dellums probably congratulated the murderers.

				Oakland has become a primarily &#8220;Black&#8221; run and controlled city. Among those in positions of influential leadership are radical &#8220;Black&#8221; activists of yesteryear. The city implemented most of the racial social agenda that came out of the 60s. It appears these &#8220;Black&#8221; leaders are not having any better luck at controlling their fellow &#8220;Blacks&#8221; than the city&rsquo;s pre Jerry Brown White leaders had.

				&#8220;Motorcycle officer John Hege, 41, was declared brain dead Sunday morning at Highland Hospital in Oakland and remained on life support to preserve his organs for donation.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are an organ donor, get a new dr&rsquo;s license. No white should donate organs anymore. Blacks now get absolute priority for donated organs, despite the fact that they absolutely do not donate organs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even the medical and nursing textbooks, which are sickeningly politically correct and pro minority make it clear that American blacks, immigrant blacks, asians, hispanics, middle easterners and white immigrants such as persians, russians, armenians do not donate organs although they make use of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why should a White American be an organ donor when White Americans are denied organs because they are White? Why should White Americans donate organs that will be used to prolong the lives of the blacks who murder, rape and rob us with not just impunity but the encouragement and enablement of our government?
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest ethnic group of physicians in the large medical center where I work is Chinese. The largest ethnic group of nurses are Phillipinos. Most every body else is asian, pacific islander, hispanic, indian or middle easterner.
			</p>
			<p>
				There were huge posters up in my hospital begging, absolutely begging for an asian bone marrow donor. Not one, not one of the numerous asian doctors, nurses, med techs etc would donate bone marrow. The posters were up for more than a year. The posters reported the deterioration of the patients condition. The patient finally died because none of her asian fellows would donate bone marrow.
			</p>
			<p>
				We whites can do nothing about affirmative action, anti white racism, black on white crime. There is nothing we can do to stop our own government&rsquo;s program to exterminate us.
			</p>
			<p>
				But we don&rsquo;t have to donate our organs to those who steal our jobs, teach students to hate us in the colleges and who commit black on white crime.

				One wonders how much of this is due to the softening of police tactics vis-a-vis blacks due to litigation on the part of blacks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note how the type of weapon in the second shooting is important (important because it was an &#8220;assault rifle&#8221;), but not in the first shooting (presumably because it was a pistol - I say &#8220;presumably&#8221; because I haven&rsquo;t read a description of the weapon at all in any of the reports; maybe it was a potato gun. Slingshot?). Important because liberals (including FOX News, apparently) want to ban whatever it is they classify as &#8220;assault rifles.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Why a white man would become a police officer in this day and age is beyond me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just some thinking aloud about &#8220;banning&#8221; &#8220;assault rifles&#8221;:
			</p>
			<p>
				1) Banning guns is a bad idea because guns have positive uses, i.e., self-defense, which trump their negative uses.
			</p>
			<p>
				2) The Constitution protects our right to bear arms; it doesn&rsquo;t restrict the right to non-&#8220;assault rifles,&#8221; so an &#8220;assault rifle&#8221; ban would be illegal and a direct violation of our Constitutionally-protected rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				3) Even if manufacturers are banned from making &#8220;assault rifles&#8221; in these U.S.A., it won&rsquo;t keep them out of the hands of criminals because other countries will continue to manufacture them, and they&rsquo;ll subsequently be smuggled into these U.S.A.
			</p>
			<p>
				4) As a consequence of 3, criminals in general, and professional criminals in particular, would have an enormous advantage over law-abiding citizens.
			</p>
			<p>
				5) A ban on assault weapons might start a black market arms race, in order to cater to the needs of otherwise law-abiding citizens. It might lead to an &#8220;arms war&#8221; to go along with our &#8220;drug war,&#8221; where violence surrounding illicit materiel is incentivized.

				A Google search doesn&rsquo;t support my perception that &#8220;pistol&#8221; is under-emphasized, and &#8220;assault rifle&#8221; over-emphasized, due to a gun-control agenda. I got fewer hits for the perp&rsquo;s name plus &#8220;pistol&#8221; than I did for the perp&rsquo;s name plus &#8220;assault rifle,&#8221; and the perp&rsquo;s name plus &#8220;rifle&#8221; didn&rsquo;t give many more. It is possible that the terms would generate significantly different hit proportions if the perp&rsquo;s name was left out, but since that would introduce so much noise as to make the search useless, I won&rsquo;t try.

				When will enough be enough? Im not sure how this all played out and what specifically happened during the actual engagement, but when I was teaching CQB (Close Quarters Battle) there was no way in hell a lone gunman would have gotten the jump on my team. I wonder just what level of training these men had, specifically with barricaded suspects, did any minority leeway take place, where the officers tactics restrained in some manner?
			</p>
			<p>
				We can second guess the actions of the police and teach tactics over and over but what was this career criminal doing out in the first place?

				I hope this is a wake up call to everyone, LEO and civilian, when dealing with blacks have your weapon ready.

				As a 43 year old white man, I like this site and showing us the &#8220;other side&#8221; of what&rsquo;s going on in the news, but there are times in which Amren.com is reactionary almost to the point of being ludicrous. So what, a couple of idiotic blacks on a crackpot site cheered a man who murdered police. Read some of the stormfront posts about Tim McVey blowing up the OK Federal Building and you see congratulations that make that look tame. I think this man was a criminal and a monster, but the growing police state we are living in concerns me much more than any black gang banger.

				Since 1965, how many whites have been murdered by Blacks? How many Blacks murdered by whites? The war is on, and we are losing it. &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; -HM

				There was only one MSM that dared to show his photo shortly after this tragic event. When I returned on line to reread this article, it had been removed. In my opinion, the public should have the entire details along with available photos of this latest Public Enemy. If the black community has a problem with the truth and reality, then it&rsquo;s time for the rest to face facts. Most of the blacks REFUSE to accept responsibility for their actions PERIOD.

				I have a sincere question for Elitist (or any liberal), and I&rsquo;m not trying to be a sarcastic or rude. I&rsquo;m just curious: You&rsquo;ve recognized the links between blacks, their culture, and crime, as uncomfortable as it may be. Do your fellow liberals know the truth and just pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist? Do they honestly believe diversity is a success? Will anything change their minds about race or not?

				Some of you are flat out wrong in stating that the news coverage of this has been weak. There are thousands of news articles about this event on google news and many are very detailed. I didn&rsquo;t have to do more than look at the titles of the news results before I knew the race of the perp. There are already editorials condemning the murders and the actions and attitudes of the Oakland residents and the reactions of many commentators on the articles would surprise many amren readers as they are very truthful about the racial realities of Oakland.<br />

				&#8220;<i>My husband and I often play guess the race of the perp of any criminal reported on the news.</i>&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Let me save you the trouble Jen, so you and your husband can do something more fun:
			</p>
			<p>
				If the perp is white, they <b>ALWAYS</b> mention the race (with accompanying photo, if available).
			</p>
			<p>
				If the perp is black, and if you can&rsquo;t guess from the name (e.g. NuShawn or any other &#8216;authentically black&rsquo; name), they almost <b>NEVER</b> mention the race (or rarely show any photos).
			</p>
			<p>
				If the perp is brown, they also almost <b>NEVER</b> mention the race (or rarely show any photos), BUT the name almost always gives it away (obviously).
			</p>
			<p>
				So, to sum up class &mdash; no mention of race and/or no photo (and not a spanish name) = perp is <b>BLACK</b>.

				I agree with some posters that this didn&rsquo;t get much media attention. I think the subtext is that this is expected behavior and we shouldn&rsquo;t be all that surprised. Most people realize that this occurred in a &#8220;war zone within the US&#8221; and had nothing to do with normal people. There should be a huge, official list of &#8220;no go zones,&#8221; and we should just consider them to be former parts of the US that no one should ever travel to or even pay attention to.

				NM Realist is part of the problem. What distinquishes whites from other races is that we do our jobs, even when, as defense attorneys, our jobs are distasteful. If everyone does their job, the system works. If we don&rsquo;t the system crumbles, as we&rsquo;re seeing today. NM Realist, the criminal defense attorney who &#8220;got off&#8221; Mixon on a previous charge was doing his or her job. No more, no less.

				I mentioned Michael Savage earlier in this thread. On his show last night, a former undercover cop called him, as Savage asked how Mixon&rsquo;s sister was able to have a high powered rifle at her domicile waiting for him to use, in what I think was an ambush. The caller told Savage that in the arena of high powered rifles, it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re flowing from the U.S. to Mexico, per the recent fashionable propaganda, they&rsquo;re flowing from the Mexico to the U.S., as Mexico is getting them through the vast international black market.
			</p>
			<p>
				I fell for the propaganda that Mexican drug gangs were getting almost all of their guns from the U.S., in order to make a border wall point of it. However, I finally started to question the bromide &mdash; someone told me that if you keep hearing something said over and over again, that&rsquo;s when you should be critical. Why are we to assume that Mexican gangs are getting all their guns from the U.S.? Why can&rsquo;t they be getting them from the international black market?
			</p>
			<p>
				The caller thinks the high powered rifle that Mixon&rsquo;s sister had in her domicile came from Mexico and in turn was manufactured in Russia.
			</p>
			<p>
				Incidentally, the news media made a big deal over some Phoenix gun dealer who was up on Federal charges of supplying illegal people with guns. They kept telling us that this one gun shop was the prime source of guns getting into the hands of Mexican drug gangsters, and that convicting him and closing his store would solve all the problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Harrumph &mdash; a Federal judge last week made a summary judgment for the gun dealer and dismissed the Feds&rsquo; criminal charges, for a total absence of evidence. You didn&rsquo;t hear that on the news much, did you?
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal prosecutors have a very high success rate (97%) because they don&rsquo;t waste their time with cases they can&rsquo;t win, plus they have the luxury of dealing with Federal laws that are relatively easy to solve, the unbaggable crimes are almost always state level. Also, Federal juries aren&rsquo;t limited to the jurisdiction where the charges are brought, for example, state charges in St. Louis City require St. Louis City jurors, i.e. black, i.e. nullification. However, Federal charges brought at St. Louis can have jurors anywhere in the eastern half of Missouri, i.e. whiter, i.e. no nullification. However, the Feds wasted their time with this gun dealer, I think they deliberately did this to intimidate legitimate gun dealers and gun shops. However, if they keep doing this, they&rsquo;ll lower the success rate for Federal criminal charges, thereby marginally reducing the fear in the Federal Justice Department.

				Of course, but the difference is numbers. Whites can build a civilized society while dealing with a small criminal element. The judicial system can function. But when you have 30% or more of society becoming lawless and refusing to be productive, that society or city will break down. The court and prison system become overwhelmed. Schools fail and taxpayers are overburdened. That is becoming the norm in many American cities.<br />

				Well, Curious, thanks for asking.<br />
				Here are the reasons, its a bit complicated:
			</p>
			<p>
				1) Much of the rhetoric from the right seems not to promise much by way of racial reconciliation, so one speaks in euphemisms and half-truths, with fingers crossed (wilful and virtuous blindness).
			</p>
			<p>
				2) some libs know highly intelligent, successful blacks (I sure do), and assume that they could become the norm. Some are related to blacks. Some are multiracial. participating in the civil right movement was a transforming experience for many (now older) libs. (so its often personal)
			</p>
			<p>
				3) many libs are afraid (with good reason) of losing jobs &amp; friends if they utter an un-PC word. Some are also terrified of black activists, ie on campuses. (conformism, groupthink, intimidation)
			</p>
			<p>
				4) we tranformed the US in many ways to resolve the race issue (quotas, social programs, positive cultural PR efforts, etc.), and its hard to admit is was mainly a flop (let&rsquo;s just wait a little longer&hellip;with fingers crossed&hellip;.). (sheer optimism, belief in social progress)
			</p>
			<p>
				5) many libs are isolated from urban blacks because they live in nice communities (where the few blacks are usually sterling types). After a while, they confuse the reality on TV (which has become a sea of blacks physicists, neurosurgeons, CEOS, and civil engineers) with reality (except that they never actually get a black doctor at their elite hospitals, just Asians&hellip;)
			</p>
			<p>
				6) If it really is true that blacks are on average of limited intellect and high aggressivity, then this a problem without a solution - we libs really hate those kind!
			</p>
			<p>
				7) then there is the fashionable self-loathing and guilt about the usual laundry list of European crimes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Someone should research whether whites who feel good about being white, &amp; are openly proud of their European cultural heritage (how could anyone but a total moron not be??) are healthier, live longer, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				I live in Germany, and it is a pleasure to see so many people here shake off the guilt culture without turning into thugs (well, a few have) and reclaiming their German culture (with continued apologies for those 12 really nasty years).
			</p>
			<p>
				Conclusion: libs are a bit brainwashed re race, but there is much to be valued about the liberal heritage, which is as a much a part of European and American civilization as complex music and the natural sciences, rational government, and the conservationist movemement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once whites reclaim their identities as Europeans without apology, we will also get along better with the others, who despise us anyway for all this pervsre and masochistic self-abasement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blacks spun out of control when the rules became unclear, and when most of them realized they lacked the aptitudes to really take advantage of all that new opportunity, hence the crazy quilt of paranoid explanations, which are hard to maintain when new immigrant groups arrive &amp; succeed like clockwork over and over again.
			</p>
			<p>
				The libs are partly at fault for holding out the unreal promise of total black equality in all occupations.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no really nice way of saying that some racial minorities needs simple jobs &amp; vigilant policing, and that only a few will make it into professional life.

				You&rsquo;re missing the point: &#8220;the system&#8221; is not working. The System is allowing animals like Mixon to walk the street, and terrorize and/or kill innocents. How convenient for you to say that as a defense attorney, you&rsquo;re simply doing your job. Weren&rsquo;t the Nazi&rsquo;s &#8220;just doing their jobs&#8221; when they were murdering innocents? Your thesis is not one based on morality, or doing what is &#8220;right&#8221;. Shame on you, and other soulless defense attorneys just doing their jobs. And equally culpable are the spineless judges that allow these psychopaths to continually victimize honest, law-abiding citizens.

				When I see the tactics police use in other cities compared to <br />
				LAPD, (where I used to live), it is a stark difference.<br />
				LAPD are the best trained police officers around.<br />
				and they take no captives, if the situation warrants.<br />
				They always swarm their opponent, and the ratio of officer&rsquo;s lives lost is relatively lower in comparison to other cities. <br />
				I really don&rsquo;t care for the them at all, but the way they handle <br />
				their business is impressive. Come to L.A and find out.<br />

				This is how it happened, same thing happens in Iraq. These guys are trained to go into a building/room/enclosed area balls to ass close and consequently get killed! In Iraq, going into a bldg like that with a bomber who KNOWS if he waits 5 seconds more that there will be 5 to 8 men in the blast area and yelling DOWN!! DOWN!!! does no good at all and this killer KNEW he had the police outgunned. Training should be CHANGED now.

			<p>
				I find that difficult to believe. Short of the IR that sees through walls, I don&rsquo;t know how it could be impossible, or even highly unlikely that a single combatant could get the jump on a SWAT team.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a good example; Mixon was hiding in a closet with an AK47 type weapon. From what I&rsquo;ve read elsewhere, he fired through the wall of the closet. How would it be impossible, or even very unlikely, for a single combatant to get the jump on officers in this scenario?

			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously, the media <b>does</b> do everything it can to suppress the nature of black crime, and one rule-proving exception doesn&rsquo;t change that (this is especially a rule-proving exception, since it&rsquo;s such a huge crime (4 police officers in just a few hours, at the hands of just one criminal?) that it&rsquo;s impossible to keep the lid on it).

				I predict this story will see an early retirement.

				Not saying the media&rsquo;s being honest, just pointing out why people would tend to characterize the media&rsquo;s handling of the incident a certain way, even if it wasn&rsquo;t accurate.

				<i>Every state should have the DEATH PENALTY for those who murder police officers.</i>

				Careful, it almost sounds like you think the lives of policemen are more valuable than the lives of private citizens.

				Svigor, those who will so easily kill armed officers are even more dangerous to the general public. That&rsquo;s the logic I suppose for some wanting to make murder of a police officer an automatic death penalty case.

				Someone remarked on the LAPD being the best and best trained police dept in the US. That used to be true until the Commie Feds got their consent decree. Now the department is majority minority and has been having problems with officer safety and more when going after armed criminals. The force has been dumbed down. It&rsquo;s obvious when you meet with the average LAPD officer, who is now a mestizo with an attitude.

				Didn&rsquo;t you ever watch Dragnet? Joe Friday (Jack Webb) was right when he said that those who shoot at cops are more dangerous than the average thug, for if he would do that to a cop who is armed and trained, he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to do that and worse to a regular person.
