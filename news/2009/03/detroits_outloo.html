<h1>Detroit&rsquo;s Outlook Falls Along With Home Prices</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Jones, Chicago Tribune, January 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It may be tough to get financing for a new car these days, but in Detroit you can buy a house with a credit card.</p>
<p>The median price of a home sold in Detroit in December was $7,500, according to Realcomp, a listing service.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the many dispiriting numbers that bleakly depict the decrepitude of this onetime industrial behemoth, the steep slide of housing values helps define the daunting challenge to anyone who wants to lead this shrinking, poverty-pocked city of about 800,000 people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the depth of the hole, Evans [Warren Evans, sheriff of Wayne County] is running for mayor. In fact, he is one of 15 people who have raised their hands to be mayor of Detroit and fill the remaining months in office of the former mayor who now wears a green jumpsuit and resides in Evans&rsquo; spartan house of justice, the Wayne County Jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York bond-rating houses this month lowered the city&rsquo;s bond rating to junk status, a lowly assessment shared by New Orleans and few others.</p>
<p>On a positive note, Detroit&rsquo;s homicide rate dropped 14 percent last year. That prompted mayoral candidate Stanley Christmas to tell the Detroit News recently, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t mean to be sarcastic, but there just isn&rsquo;t anyone left to kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detroit voters will choose two candidates in a Feb. 24 primary who will face off in May. In the meantime, the city faces a projected budget deficit of at least $300 million, with no clear view on how to erase it. &#8220;If we don&rsquo;t get it right, we could be headed for a state takeover or receivership,&#8221; warned Dave Bing, a mayoral candidate best known for draining jump shots for the Detroit Pistons back in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s. {snip}</p>
<p>Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr., who assumed the mayor&rsquo;s office by virtue of his being president of the City Council, promised he is &#8220;not going to let [receivership] happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detroit, which has lost half its population in the past 50 years, is deceptively large, covering 139 square miles. Manhattan, San Francisco and Boston could, as a group, fit inside the city&rsquo;s boundaries. There is no major grocery chain in the city, and only two movie theaters. Much of the neighborhood economy revolves around rib joints, hot dog stands and liquor stores. The candidates travel around this sprawling city, some invoking the nostalgic era of Big Three dominance and vowing that Detroit can be great again.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick&rsquo;s election in 2001 lured Henry Hassan back to Detroit from Minnesota. Hassan, who opened a restaurant on the city&rsquo;s northwest side, said he was quickly disillusioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember the riots in &#8216;67?&#8221; Hassan said, referring to the cataclysmic five days that left 43 dead and more than 2,000 buildings burned down. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a little worse than that right now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We need somebody to come in and care for the city more than they care for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand people are leaving the city every month,&#8221; Mogk [John Mogk, a professor at Wayne State University Law School.] said, &#8220;and the city does not have the financial resources and the economic base to solve its own problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To the surprise of many in this overwhelmingly black city (82 percent), only 53 percent of registered voters turned out for November&rsquo;s presidential election, which featured the first African-American nominee. It wasn&rsquo;t long ago that a Democrat couldn&rsquo;t carry Michigan without a big turnout in Detroit. As it turned out, Detroit&rsquo;s votes didn&rsquo;t matter in the election.</p>

			<p>Hey, they managed to get a city populated and run by a black majority - I say just let them continue running it into the ground:<br>
If whites <i>do</i> help them, they&rsquo;ll start whining that &#8220;<i>whites are stealing our jobs!</i>&#8221;<br>
If whites  help them, they&rsquo;ll keep whining that &#8220;<i>whites have abandoned us!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>I pick Option 2, as it&rsquo;s less expensive - and Whitey gets blamed anyways.</p>

 All I can say is that if they expect people to buy a home and  move there, they need to offer them MORE than $7,500! </p>

<p>Groups of them attend nearly unworkable faux debate forums about how they will solve the city&rsquo;s troubles, with responses to last no more than 60 seconds. Given the complexity of problems that defy sound-bite answers, their proposed solutions range from the predictable to the wacky:</p>
<p>More cops on the street. </p>
<p>Make high school graduation mandatory.</p>
<p>Grow your own food.</p>
<p>Bulldoze large stretches of the city and turn them into wind farms.</p>
<p>Procreate like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.</p>
<p><br>
The African-Detroiters should have no trouble with this solution.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Median price of Detroit homes sold in December: $7,500.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw that stat on a news show the other day, and had to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Give the Obamanation enough time, and he&rsquo;ll do his level best to reduce white wealth in the country in an attempt to get it in line with the black norm.  He&rsquo;s in the process of a shift in wealth right now, probably trying to keep from laughing everytime the stockmarket goes down substantially.</p>
<p>A black community organizer that makes upgrading blacks and only blacks his life&rsquo;s work isn&rsquo;t about to change his goals when he&rsquo;s elected pres.  </p>
<p>He has to be jumping for joy, because it&rsquo;s get-back-at-whitey-time.  Jeremiah the hater and Calypso Louie must be bursting with pride and joy as well.<br>

			<p>This is fascinating. One of the greatest cities in America is now a shell of its former self. I was always an admirer of Henry Ford. He would be rolling over in his grave if he knew of the disaster Detroit has become. I actually remember when I was younger reading of how the racial tensions in the city were escalating as blacks were moving in and taking over. This is a great lesson on how the Black man can turn gold into a big pile of nothing.</p>

			<p>Jayfresh:</p>
<p>You might want to consider your admiration of Henry Ford.  </p>
<p>Society is too complex for this to be completely the case, but if there is any one person who could be said to be the most responsible for Detroit being a heavily black and Arab city, it&rsquo;s Henry Ford.  He actively recruited among southern blacks and in the Middle East in the 1920s through the early 1940s to flood Detroit with people and cheap labor in order to break the emerging union movement.  Of course, many southern blacks were eager to leave the South, because it was in between the world wars that southern agriculture finally became mechanized, and there became very little need for black stoop labor.</p>
<p>There are some on the right-wing, albeit not many, who idolize Henry Ford because he made a few comments about a certain ethnicity.  These are the same kind of right-wingers who we&rsquo;re supposed to think have all this foaming at the mouth &#8220;bigotry&#8221; against blacks, yet the idolize a man who helped turned Detroit black.</p>
<p>However, for the kind of responsible racial right-winger who doesn&rsquo;t see a Jew under every rock and hiding between ever crevice, Henry Ford isn&rsquo;t a hero.</p>

			<p>At those prices, a wealthy entrepeneur could buy up the whole city for a song but I imagine the property taxes on a single home are alot more than the property is worth.  There&rsquo;s a lot of beautiful architecture in that city that is crumbling from years of decay and blight.  No, I hope I never live to see the day that Detroit gentrifies because all those rising property values would drive the blacks out into the White suburbs.  Detroit is just a holding pen for criminals, rapists, welfare cheats of society and it should stay that way.</p>

<p>You make some good points. I knew that Ford had been instrumental in bringing Mississippi delta blacks to Detroit to use for &#8220;union-busting&#8221; but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of his mideast connection. Would you be able to cite any sources on that? I would also mention that the great majority of Arabs that came too America at this time were Christians and had a westernized culture and outlook. They were a world away from the Arabs who arrive here today.</p>

Reading that only 53 percent of registered voters turned out this past election makes me wonder if:</p>
<p>  a) Previously registered voters had simiply left the city by then, or<br>
  b) A large number of the registrations were fraudulent, a la ACORN, but for some reason no one used them to put in fraudulent votes, or<br>
  c) Detroit voters are so low on the intellectual totem pole that they aren&rsquo;t interested in voting, even when &#8220;their&#8221; candidate is black.<br>

			<p>     Anyone up for being a pioneer? We could go in<br>
there with an axe in one hand and a gun in the other<br>
and reclaim this land for America. Yes, we would have<br>
to subdue the natives but think of the long term. We&rsquo;d<br>
be getting in on the ground floor of the new Detroit and<br>
that means big money. In the meantime, we could buy up the<br>
burned out lots and farm them. Forget the houses, we<br>
tear them down and use the material to build a fort. No way<br>
they&rsquo;re going to pick us off one by one like they did the last<br>
time both here and in Zimbabwe. It would be the Catholic Village<br>
model not the American Protestant. We live semi-communally in the<br>
fort and walk out together to work in the fields. The cold, lack<br>
of heat, welfare, and all other Federal handouts will gradually<br>
drive the natives back South. Our presence will just hurry them<br>
along. Our descendents will follow them and conquer them there as<br>
well.</p>

<p>I agree with you 100%. Ford either had no foresight or just didn&rsquo;t care.<br>
 When&rsquo;s the last time anyone was assaulted by roving gangs of Jewish &#8220;youfs&#8221;? When I was first married my wife and I bought our first house in a predominantly Jewish section of Northeast Philadelphia. They ranged from Orthodox to Conservative to Reform. We had 16 foot airlight row houses and were all middle class. No one was &#8220;rich&#8221;. We couldn&rsquo;t have asked for better neighbors and several years of harmony and mutual respect. We attended each other&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s Bar Mitzvahs, First Communions,  Confirmations and shared our grief over lost loved ones. Then even that area began to &#8220;change&#8221; as &#8220;diversity&#8221; approached and most of it is unrecognizable from what it was.</p>
<p>This obsession with ad nauseum Jew baiting needs to stop. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true, but you can&rsquo;t afford to pay the property taxes on that $7000 house. It&rsquo;s just like Buffalo and Rochester, NY. When government is the only employer, white homeowners become the piggy bank.</p>

			<p>blacks clamoured to be in power here, now they are and unlike the days when whites ran the town and EVERYONE prospered, today No One Prospers or is even SAFE anywhere in the city.  blacks have shown over and over again that they do not have the ability to head just about anything, NOW we have their infiltration into Washington and our country seems to headed into the very same shambles we find in Detroit and any other black controlled area?  blacks NEVER seem to build they seem to lie in wait for others to do something of value then cry out to be included and if and when they are what what good and great collapses under the weight of what they call Their Culture? Have you ever noticed when blacks want to Get Into A Better neighborhood it is Always White and never a Better black area, because that is non existent. CLOSE your eyes as I say &#8220;bad area&#8221; and when I  do does a picture of little blonde headed children headed to school come into your mind? Of course not and it doesn&rsquo;t in mine either?</p>

			<p>Let Detroit die.</p>
<p>There is no point in pursuing futile goals in an attempt to bring up dysfunctional groups or the areas they live in.  Let them have total control and run the whole city into the ground.  Then, they can have no one to blame but themselves and they will not be getting one tax dollar from me to save them.</p>
<p>It should be an interesting experiment if the state or national leadership has the guts to allow it to happen.  In about ten years they will be armored bus adventure tours to drive through &#8220;America&rsquo;s Chernobyl&#8221;.</p>

I can hardly afford my monthly bills and taxes now. Won&rsquo;t be long before I lose everything I ever worked for because&hellip;.I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT&hellip;FIRST MISTAKE, I KEPT A JOB AND PAID TAXES FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS.

			<p>The fortress model has some appeal, but eventually you have to interact with your neighbors.  The current political debate is useless, left screams &#8220;racism&#8221; (whatever that is?) and those on the putative right cower or go into wordist disembling to cover themselves with a veneer.  Its quite simple we whites simply do not accept anti-white behavior or policies even if they are done under the false banner of &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; (they mean anti-white).  Once we stand up and say no to anti-white behavior and speak directly to our problems, you would be suprised how genial relations could become.</p>

Give &#8216;em land and houses,give them a tax free window of say 5 years or so. Allow them to create industry  &mdash;  and see what happens. And yes,as a previous writer noted,if they succeed,theyll be blamed;if they dont,theyll be blamed. </p>

			<p>I never understood the animus for Jews that some people have. I agree with the above posters. They seem quite good at building stable, harmonius societies. When I&rsquo;m in a jewish neighborhood I don&rsquo;t feel fearful.</p>
<p>My theory on this is that people dislike Jews for the same reason that blacks don&rsquo;t like whites-they are smarter. Jews have shown to have on average a higher IQ than other groups. I&rsquo;ve read where Ashkenazi Jews have an average IQ of 117. This higher IQ naturally makes them more successful than other whites. This coupled with their strong group identity makes for a very potent economic force, giving them all sorts of economic power, which leads to jealousy and group hatred.</p>
<p>Blacks are the other side of this scenario. They see themselves outsmarted and outworked at every turn by the white man. They don&rsquo;t quite understand the reasons for the white control of institutions, they just know they hate the white man for it.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t hate Jews and I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re smarter.  A lot of my best friends in school were Jewish (I went to school in the Detroit suburbs).</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t want to admit that they&rsquo;re not equal with whitey.  Hey, no two PEOPLE are equal!  Not in terms of intelligence, talent, etc.  Equal before the law, yes, equal in human worth, yes  &mdash;  but other than that, forget it.</p>

			<p>Eric The Red and Josh have the right idea, however Detroit (as are all Great Lakes cities) is going to be frozen toast anyway in the post peak petroleum age. Too hard to survive the winter there en masse no matter how productive a new wave of fort building colonists may be.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the meantime, the city faces a projected budget deficit of at least $300 million, with no clear view on how to erase it. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What few realize is just how much the economy in Detroit they already pay for. Most think in terms of just welfare but that&rsquo;s just the very tip of a huge support system. Most of the monies come from grants, hud, earmarks, department of education, road subsidies, energy subsidies, state subsidized property taxes. Even the few mainline businesses that target Detroit do so with the knowledge that it&rsquo;s a tit for tat expense for favors from the feds. GM being the biggest example of this stupidity. Here&rsquo;s a death bed company that bought the most expensive building in Detroit, with it&rsquo;s massive property tax bill (The Renaissance Center) and just wasted $135 million building the &#8220;River Walk&#8221; at ground zero. Money that ultimately is paid for by the Federal bailout. </p>
<p>For the last 6 years, money was drained from the banking system by outright fraud as black appraisers, loan agents and home buyers colluded to churn $7500 slums at inflated prices of 50 to 60 thousand dollars. I&rsquo;d guesstimate that Detroiters alone raped about 3 to 4 billion just from this.</p>
<p>Add in the 10&rsquo;s of billions that Detroit blacks received under affirmative action programs and you stare to realize the scope of the theft. Now with the economy collapsing, many of these dollars will disappear and Detroit and other big cities will revert to true anarchy.</p>

<p><br>
Jews tend to be clannish  &mdash;  big deal.  I wish whites were.  Some white Christians will never get over the fact that the Jews were supposed to be somehow responsible for their god&rsquo;s murder.  Also, conspiracy believers like to think the world is run by a secret cabal of Jews (along with their toady white allies, like the Rockefellers).  In my experience, Jews can be faulted for voting Democrat, but, then again, the Repubs haven&rsquo;t been that much better.  My relations with Jews have always been cordial. </p>

<p>Sounds like a city ripe for a reconquista of our own. And if D.C. eventually bails out the auto industry - which it can, and should - then things will soon be looking up.</p>

In reading these comments, I just remembered the classic movie &#8220;Robocop,&#8221; which takes place in a completely dysfunctional Detroit.  The racial aspect isn&rsquo;t touched on, but the idea that a city can thoroughly decay is beautifully portrayed.</p>

			<p>Jewish people in America are WHITE.  When Blacks go on roving, wilding nights to prey on Whites, they don&rsquo;t ask themselves if the prospective Jewish couple or teens are White or Jewish&hellip;. They just simply attack &#8220;To get back at the Man&#8221;.  Now I know that their are Black Jewish people (Fallashas), but in the main, Jewish people are White here in the U.S.  I only Wish they, as a group, would stop Identifying more with &#8220;People with color&#8221; and commiserate with the White plight, like Jewamongyou posts all the time.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Jews tend to be clannish &mdash; big deal. I wish whites were. Some white Christians will never get over the fact that the Jews were supposed to be somehow responsible for their god&rsquo;s murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a White Christian, I have no religious beef with the Jews. Jesus Was a Jew. Jews did not &#8220;murder&#8221; my God, my Messiah came willingly and gave himself up as a sacrafice for ALL. <br>
As for your other point; Yes, Jews are very clannish and I wish us non-Jewish White people were allowed to be as well.<br>
White people are not Allowed to organize any kind of group for our own causes or intersests without being called &#8220;Racist&#8221;, &#8220;Bigotted&#8221;, &#8220;Supremescist&#8221;, &#8220;Haters&#8221; etc&hellip;<br>
My only bone of contention with Jews is with the secular (mostly Upper-Northeast Liberal) type Jews who infest the ADL that   champion any and all anti-White causes, and slam even the most benign gathering of White Thought (such as Am. Ren.) as Hateful and Racist.<br>
Millions of White Christians died in foreign lands fighting a regime that perpetrated Genocide on the Jewish people. It would be nice if the Jewish people could cut us a little slack when we  mearly protest the slow genocide of the White Cristian in our own lands.<br>

			<p>Detroit and now DC are being led by blacks who have little to no concrete evidence to show they can manage anything let alone government.  Throw in the horrible black crime stats across the country, as published by DOJ and it becomes obvious that massive failure is going to occur. A major example is the continent of Africa.  When whites were tossed out these countries crumbled immediately, basic society broke down, government and military ran wild killing, raping and pillaging.  SA Africa took over the farmlands from whites and instantly no food, meat, poultry or vegetables.    </p>
<p>This is what Obama wants for this country to tear it down then bring it back under a Socialist regime with him as hero.  I&rsquo;m wondering what he will use as the final straw to break the camels back and declare himself Messiah officially?</p>
<p>Also please don&rsquo;t associate jew haters with right wingers, they are in the Nationalist league if anything.</p>

<p>James,<br>
I WILL give you that! I sometimes feel that those exceedingly secular Jews are completely out of touch with reality. And with the ascendency of Blacks, the above mentioned seculars will not be cut any slack. We can only hope that they&rsquo;ll see the light eventually.<br>
Jews suffer the predations of Blacks like any other White people; the hideous murders and God knows what else of Eve Carson and Lauren Burk being two examples. I can&rsquo;t forget the callous &#8220;they reaped what they sowed&#8221; sentiments expressed by some who post here.<br>
 Those beautiful young women were the products of the ideology with which they had been browbeaten since kindergarten. They were innocent victims of the &#8220;Progressive&#8221; society that ingrained in them the belief that all people are inherently good and that there are no traits, some sociopathic,  that are peculiar to one race or ethnicity. It&rsquo;s this doctrine that puts typically idealistic youth at grave risk. As an educator, I see it every day on the High School level. Young White girls constantly being &#8220;hit on&#8221; by Blacks who know that to reject them would be construed as racism. Several years ago a young student of mine came to me for advice because a Black boy was constantly soliciting her for a date and implying that she was racist if she refused.<br>
  At the risk of losing my job should she relate our conversation to someone else,  I advised her that she was under no obligation to accept his advances simply because he is black and that she had the perfect right to her preferences, be they racial or religious and that she should in no way feel &#8220;guilty&#8221;. <br>
We shouldn&rsquo;t teach our kids to hate but certainly teach them the necessary survival skills. We send them away to colleges far from home, like lambs into a pack of hyenas, many times totally unprepared to survive.</p>

&#8220;The median price of a home sold in Detroit in December was $7,500, according to Realcomp, a listing service.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
I eagerly await the follow-up think-pieces in the MSM, explaining that Detroit has become an undesirable place to buy a home or raise a family due to all the loud house-parties held by Ted Nugent, Bob Seger, and the MC5. </p>

			<p>Does anyone not think that what happened to Detroit, Los Angeles and dozens of other cities was not by design?  Whether it&rsquo;s the NAACP, ACLU, SPLC, NOW, LaRAZA, LULAC or the ADL, all roads point in the same direction.  </p>
