<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5913979.ece">Thousands of Girls Mutilated in Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Kerbaj, Times of London, March 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NHS is to advertise free operations to reverse female circumcisions, with experts warning that each year more than 500 British girls have their genitals mutilated.</p>
<p>Despite having been outlawed in 1985, female circumcision is still practised in British African communities, in some cases on girls as young as 5. Police have been unable to bring a single prosecution even though they suspect that community elders are being flown from the Horn of Africa to carry out the procedures.</p>
<p>The advertisement will appear from next month on a Somali satellite TV station much viewed in Britain. It features Juliet Albert, a midwife who does the reverse operations, and promises, in English and Somali, confidentiality for victims of female genital mutilation.</p>
<p>The advertisement was expected to help to undermine demand for girls to be circumcised, and to popularise the reversal procedure, Ms Albert said. Thousands of such operations have been carried out at specialist clinics and hospitals around Britain and demand is growing slowly.</p>
<p>Female circumcision, which is done for various reasons, such as religious and cultural traditions, can cause severe health complications including infections and psychological problems. The procedure, predominantly carried out on girls aged between 5 and 12, can range from the removal of the clitoris to the removal of all the exterior parts of the vagina, which is then sewn up.</p>
<p>A study by the Foundation for Women&rsquo;s Health, Research and Development (Forward), estimated that 66,000 women living in England and Wales had been circumcised, most before leaving their country of origin. The government-funded research also found that more than 7,000 girls were at a high risk of being subjected to genital mutilation in Britain.</p>
<p>Sarah McCulloch, of the Agency for Culture Change Management UK, said that every year more than 500 British girls were having circumcisions. &#8220;A lot of them are done in the UK, but some still travel overseas,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said that a code of silence in Britain&rsquo;s African communities had allowed circumcisions to continue and prevented arrests. The unqualified female elders, known as &#8220;house doctors&#8221; because they act in secret in a family home, are flown into the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the communities do is they gather together and collect money to pay for the ticket for a &#8216;doctor&rsquo; to come from Somalia, Sudan, or whatever,&#8221; she told The Times. &#8220;And when she arrives here, she goes to a house and has the girls brought to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Scotland Yard is understood to have made investigations into female circumcision in the UK, and offered a £20,000 reward for information, no one has been successfully prosecuted for carrying out the procedure.</p>
<p>Detective Constable Jason Morgan, from Scotland Yard&rsquo;s Project Azure, denied that police were complacent. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t bury our heads in the sand and say it&rsquo;s not going on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It is illegal to take a person abroad for the operation but no one has been prosecuted for this either.</p>
<p>Ms McCulloch said that girls were brainwashed into believing circumcision to be a cultural, and, in some cases, religious obligation that should be kept secret. &#8220;It is something they simply do not discuss  &mdash;  if they do they&rsquo;d be seen as betraying their family and their community and culture,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know many girls who want to accuse their parents but can&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t want to take their parents to court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waris Dirie, a former UN envoy for the prevention of female genital mutilation, said that it had no justification. Ms Dirie is a victim of the procedure and it haunts her to this day. &#8220;Female genital mutilation has nothing to do with tradition, religion or culture. It is the most cynical form of child abuse and a crime that has to be punished,&#8221; she told The Times.</p>
<p>Ms McCulloch said that men were becoming more vocal in opposition to female circumcision. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve talked to some fathers who&rsquo;ve made clear to their wives that they don&rsquo;t want this done to their daughters  &mdash;  only for them to go out and come back to find their girls circumcised,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Lynette Parvez, head teacher of Kelmscott School in Walthamstow, northeast London, said that several teachers there would soon be trained to detect victims of female circumcision, and pupils at risk. Experts believe that most of the procedures are done during summer holidays when the girls have enough time to recover without suspicion about their absence.</p>
<p>While Ms Parvez is unaware of any cases at her school, which serves many pupils of African origin, she said that she had been shocked and appalled to hear that female circumcisions were taking place in the UK.<br>

<p>If anything, this might make the situation worse. If these low-lifes think that the procedure might be reversed later on, they might make it more brutal, so as to make reversal impossible. I guess they&rsquo;ve never heard of &#8220;The Law of Unintended Consequences.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Compare and contrast the (in)action of the U.K. police against Africans who mutilate children, with their efforts against White men who fight for England&rsquo;s indigenous people and culture.</p>

			<p>Four and one half million cameras are in Great Britain monitoring their citizens.  The funny thing is it seems they&rsquo;re monitoring and prosecuting mostly White Britons for minor offenses and ignoring the real criminals - the Muslims and Blacks and every other dark-skinned race who&rsquo;s there either legally or illegally.  </p>
<p>Whom the gods destroy they first make mad.  Britain is a country that has gone mad.  Their destruction will be the first.  Wake up White people.</p>

			<p>Somalis developed their peculiar customs in a very harsh natural environment.  </p>
<p>Remove the unforgiving environment from their lives, and you still have the inherited urges which find them forming street gangs, involved in knife violence, having more children than they can care for, and bringing the scavenger values of desert clanspeople to Western cities.</p>

			<p>So the British refuse to prosecute thousands of immigrants who mutilate young girls but instead bring the two leaders of the BNP to trial for criticizing Islam?</p>
<p>Glad to see they have their priorities straight! </p>

			<p>Why would the marxist government care about 500 girls getting their genitals mutilated by some Arab shamen, when it is well within the the marxist plan of creating a society of 99% course, lower class, government dependents ruled by the 1% party members.  What about the hundreds of thousands of British girls with tatoos and piercings (in every place imaginable), encouraged by the British school system to be low class and promiscuous?  I am more concerned with the denigration of the White race than the medieval practices of some stooges for multiculturalism.  No wonder the muslims don&rsquo;t want to assimilate. </p>

<p>Somali satellite?</p>
<p>How did they get that?  I can pretty well guess it&rsquo;s probably made out of cardboard and baling wire placed on the beak of a seagull who they goosed into space.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t even know how to flush toilets and we&rsquo;re expected to believe they have their own satellite?</p>

			<p>I agree with flamethrower. Who cares what Africans do to each other.  </p>
<p>Hirsi Ali, the Somalian/Dutch anti Islamic activist was one of those girls whose father forbade the operation.  But he spent his time in Somalia fomenting revolution while the Mother and Grandmother and kids lived in Kenya.</p>
<p>So the Mother and Grandmother arranged for the 3 kids, 2 girls and 1 boy to be mutilated by some witch doctor, I believe a male. The kids were traumatized for months.  Hirsi Ali thinks her sister&rsquo;s emotional problems and eventual suicide were caused in part by the mutilation.</p>
<p>As a nurse, I am interested in exactly how the operation can be reversed.  The midwife must pull some interior flesh to the exterior.  I doubt a midwife has the necessary surgical skills to preform what is actually very complicated plastic surgery.</p>
<p>I saw a video of a 3 year old being mutilated by her Mother and relatives.  One thing that struck me was what they did with her legs.  To subdue her, they pulled her legs up as far as possible and then jerked them outward, almost as though they intended to split her apart.  </p>
<p>That particular child will have a lot of joint, back, hip and leg problems for the rest of her life.  The hip area is a very complicated arrangement of muscles, bones, nerves, ligaments and tendons.  What I saw those women do to that child will lead to a lifetime of disability and pain.</p>

			<p>I did a little internet research on female genital reversal.  I couldn&rsquo;t find anything.  I did find some articles about reconstruction following cancer, severe burns etc.</p>
<p>It only is done by qualified plastic surgeons in most countries.  I highly, highly doubt that some affirmative action Somalian midwife can do anything but further maul the victims of mutilation.</p>
<p>Sometimes the uretha has to be reconstructed after these operations.</p>

			<p>Ice: of course they have their own Satellite station.  You and I almost surely helped pay for it.  There&rsquo;s a lot of wealth there, in the hands of the warlords.  All of that wealth came as aid from white nations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m appalled by the cavalier way the author of this article throws out the term &#8216;circumcision&rsquo;, as if these mutilations were &#8216;mere&rsquo; clitoridectomies.  I won&rsquo;t describe these horrors, but anyone unfamiliar with FGM should google the term &#8216;Female Genital Mutilation&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s indescribably horrible, and is more than adequate justification for keeping Africans out of our world.</p>
<p>Male circumcision is not equivalent at all.  What is being done to these girls is the worst form of child molestation.  You can bet the Somali &#8216;community&rsquo; in America is also perpetuating this horror.</p>

			<p>These are NOT British girls they are talking about; they are ethnic and racially Arab girls in Islamic households who have settled in Britain due the Britain&rsquo;s wish to disintegrate its identity, including its history, traditions and indigenous British population.  When will someone admit this?</p>

<p>The caucasian Arab muslims do not do this to their women/girls to my knowledge. This horrendous undertaking is (again, to my knowledge) exclusively North African Somali and Ethiopian thing. If the Kuwaitis or Saudis do it, I have never heard of it, and I would be among the first to find another reason the criticize those people.</p>

			<p>So what was on BBC TV this morning? Long debate on the legality or otherwise of a handful of people travelling to Switzerland to commit suicide. No mention whatsover about these crimes against children and the subject is very rarely brought to public attention, no doubt because muslims in UK may be &#8216;offended&rsquo;. One more labour government pro-islamic stance. There is NOTHING they would do to criticise muslims, no matter how horrendous the act. Just the determination to have muslim MP&rsquo;s voted into parliament and take over our land. The BNP is telling the world about this every day, we must listen and act. Islam must be prevented from any further expansion in England. They are destroying our nation.</p>

			<p>Lets face it folks, the Britain of today is not the Britain of Lord Nelson or Francis Drake or James Cook. Alas, the Britain of today is a nation of absolute cowards. Britons will not take their country back!. I was in Britain in 2004 &amp; London is already largely non white. It seemed as if every English girl I did see was with a &#8220;right off the boat&#8221; african, but seeing how weak, effeminate &amp; cowardly English men have become is it any wonder?. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong &amp; the British still have what it takes to take back their country, but I have numerous English freinds here in Arizona &amp; I ask them why they did&rsquo;nt try to fix the mess in their country, most just shruggred &amp; said &#8220;what can you do&#8221;, well with defeatism like this is it any wonder as to why they are a dying civilization?.</p>
