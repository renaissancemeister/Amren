<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy">Was This Britain&rsquo;s First Black Queen?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stuart Jeffries, The Guardian (Manchester), March 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Queen Charlotte died nearly two centuries ago but is still celebrated in her namesake American city. When you drive from the airport in North Carolina, you can&rsquo;t miss the monumental bronze sculpture of the woman said to be Britain&rsquo;s first black queen, dramatically bent backwards as if blown by a jet engine. Downtown, there is another prominent sculpture of Queen Charlotte, in which she&rsquo;s walking with two dogs as if out for a stroll in 21st-century America.</p>
<p>Street after street is named after her, and Charlotte itself revels in the nickname the Queen City  &mdash;  even though, shortly after the city was named in her honour, the American War of Independence broke out, making her the queen of the enemy. And the city&rsquo;s art gallery, the Mint museum, holds a sumptuous 1762 portrait of Charlotte by the Scottish portrait painter Allan Ramsay, showing the Queen of England in regal robes aged 17, the year after she married George III.</p>
<p>Charlotte is intrigued by its namesake. Some Charlotteans even find her lovable. &#8220;We think your queen speaks to us on lots of levels,&#8221; says Cheryl Palmer, director of education at the Mint museum. &#8220;As a woman, an immigrant, a person who may have had African forebears, botanist, a queen who opposed slavery  &mdash;  she speaks to Americans, especially in a city in the south like Charlotte that is trying to redefine itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Charlotte (1744-1818) has much less resonance in the land where she was actually queen. If she is known at all here, it is from her depiction in Alan Bennett&rsquo;s play as the wife of &#8220;mad&#8221; King George III. We have forgotten or perhaps never knew that she founded Kew Gardens, that she bore 15 children (13 of whom survived to adulthood), and that she was a patron of the arts who may have commissioned Mozart.</p>
<p>Here, Charlotte is a woman who hasn&rsquo;t so much intrigued as been regularly damned. In the opening of Charles Dickens&rsquo;s A Tale of Two Cities she is dismissed in the second paragraph: &#8220;There was a king with a large jaw, and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England.&#8221; Historian John H Plumb described her as &#8220;plain and undesirable&#8221;. Even her physician, Baron Christian Friedrich Stockmar, reportedly described the elderly queen as &#8220;small and crooked, with a true mulatto face&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was famously ugly,&#8221; says Desmond Shawe-Taylor, surveyor of the Queen&rsquo;s pictures. &#8220;One courtier once said of Charlotte late in life: &#8216;Her Majesty&rsquo;s ugliness has quite faded.&rsquo; There was quite a miaow factor at court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s name was given to thoroughfares throughout Georgian Britain  &mdash;  most notably Charlotte Square in Edinburgh&rsquo;s New Town  &mdash;  but her lack of resonance and glamour in the minds of Londoners is typified by the fact that there is a little square in Bloomsbury called Queen&rsquo;s Square. In the middle is a sculpture of a queen. For much of the 19th century, the sculpture was thought to depict Queen Anne and, as a result, the square was known as Queen Anne&rsquo;s Square. Only later was it realised that the sculpture actually depicted Charlotte and the square renamed Queen Square.</p>
<p>Hold on, you might be saying. Britain has had a black queen? Did I miss something? Surely Helen Mirren played Charlotte in the film The Madness of King George and she was, last time I looked, white? Yet the theory that Queen Charlotte may have been black, albeit sketchy, is nonetheless one that is gaining currency.</p>
<p>If you google Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, you&rsquo;ll quickly come across a historian called Mario de Valdes y Cocom. He argues that her features, as seen in royal portraits, were conspicuously African, and contends that they were noted by numerous contemporaries. He claims that the queen, though German, was directly descended from a black branch of the Portuguese royal family, related to Margarita de Castro e Souza, a 15th-century Portuguese noblewoman nine generations removed, whose ancestry she traces from the 13th-century ruler Alfonso III and his lover Madragana, whom Valdes takes to have been a Moor and thus a black African.</p>
<p>It is a great &#8220;what if&#8221; of history. &#8220;If she was black,&#8221; says the historian Kate Williams, &#8220;this raises a lot of important suggestions about not only our royal family but those of most of Europe, considering that Queen Victoria&rsquo;s descendants are spread across most of the royal families of Europe and beyond. If we class Charlotte as black, then ergo Queen Victoria and our entire royal family, [down] to Prince Harry, are also black &hellip; a very interesting concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, Williams and many other historians are very sceptical about Valdes&rsquo;s theory. They argue the generational distance between Charlotte and her presumed African forebear is so great as to make the suggestion ridiculous. Furthermore, they say even the evidence that Madragana was black is thin.</p>
<p>But Valdes suggests that the way Queen Charlotte is depicted in Ramsay&rsquo;s 1762 portrait  &mdash;  which US artist Ken Aptekar is now using as the starting point for a new art project called Charlotte&rsquo;s Charlotte  &mdash;  supports the view she had African ancestors.</p>
<p>Valdes writes: &#8220;Artists of that period were expected to play down, soften or even obliterate undesirable features in a subject&rsquo;s face. [But] Sir Allan Ramsay was the artist responsible for the majority of the paintings of the queen, and his representations of her were the most decidedly African of all her portraits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valdes&rsquo;s suggestion is that Ramsay was an anti-slavery campaigner who would not have suppressed any &#8220;African characteristics&#8221; but perhaps might have stressed them for political reasons. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t see it to be honest,&#8221; says Shawe-Taylor. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got a version of the same portrait. I look at it pretty often and it&rsquo;s never occurred to me that she&rsquo;s got African features of any kind. It sounds like the ancestry is there and it&rsquo;s not impossible it was reflected in her features, but I can&rsquo;t see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it possible that other portraitists of Queen Charlotte might have soft-pedalled her African features? &#8220;That makes much more sense. It&rsquo;s quite possible. The thing about Ramsay is that, unlike Reynolds and Gainsborough, who were quite imprecise in their portraits, he was a very accurate depicter of his subjects, so that if she looked slightly more African in his portraits than others, that might be because she was more well depicted. How can you tell? She&rsquo;s dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Shawe-Taylor says that a more instructive source of images of Queen Charlotte might well be the many caricatures of her held at the British Museum. &#8220;None of them shows her as African, and you&rsquo;d suspect they would if she was visibly of African descent. You&rsquo;d expect they would have a field day if she was.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Charlotte may not have been our first black queen: there is another theory that suggests that Philippa of Hainault (1314-69), consort of Edward III and a woman who may have had African ancestry, holds that title.</p>
<p>As for Valdes, he turns out to be an independent historian of the African diaspora who has argued that Peter Ustinov, Heather Locklear, the Medicis, and the Vanderbilts have African ancestry. His theory about Charlotte even pops up on www.100greatblackbritons.com, where she appears alongside Mary Seacole, Shirley Bassey, Sir Trevor McDonald, Zadie Smith, Naomi Campbell and Baronness Scotland as one of our great Britons. Despite being thus feted, Charlotte has not yet had much attention, say, during the annual Black History week in Britain.</p>
<p>Perhaps she should get more. The suggestion that Queen Charlotte was black implies that her granddaughter (Queen Victoria) and her great-great-great-great-granddaughter (Queen Elizabeth II) had African forebears. Perhaps, instead of just being a boring bunch of semi-inbred white stiffs, our royal family becomes much more interesting. Maybe  &mdash;  and this is just a theory  &mdash;  the Windsors would do well to claim their African heritage: it might be a PR coup, one that would strengthen the bonds of our queen&rsquo;s beloved Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Or would our royal family be threatened if it were shown they had African forebears? &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think so at all. There would be no shame attached to it all,&#8221; says the royal historian Hugo Vickers. &#8220;The theory does not impress me, but even if it were true, the whole thing would have been so diluted by this stage that it couldn&rsquo;t matter less to our royal family. It certainly wouldn&rsquo;t show that they are significantly black.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fascinating about Aptekar&rsquo;s project is that he started by conducting focus group meetings with people from Charlotte to find out what the Queen and her portrait meant to citizens of the US city. &#8220;I took my cues from the passionate responses of individuals whom I asked to help me understand what Queen Charlotte represents to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resulting suite of paintings is a series of riffs on that Ramsay portrait of Charlotte. In one, a reworked portion of the portrait shows the queen&rsquo;s face overlaid with the words &#8220;Black White Other&#8221;. Another Aptekar canvas features an even tighter close up, in which the queen&rsquo;s face is overlaid with the words &#8220;Oh Yeah She Is&#8221;.</p>
<p>Among those who attended Aptekar&rsquo;s focus groups is congressman Mel Watt, one of very few African-Americans in the House of Representatives and who represents the 12th district of North Carolina which includes Charlotte. &#8220;In private conversations, African-Americans have always acknowledged and found a sense of pride in this &#8216;secret&rsquo;,&#8221; says Watt. &#8220;It&rsquo;s great that this discussion can now come out of the closet into the public places of Charlotte, so we all can acknowledge and celebrate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about the idea that she was an immigrant  &mdash;  a German teenager who had to make a new life in England in the late 18th century?</p>
<p>&#8220;We were a lot more immigrant-friendly in those days than we were friendly to people of colour,&#8221; says Watt. &#8220;We all recognised that we all came from some place else. But there was always a sense of denial, even ostracism, about being black. Putting the history on top of the table should make for opportunities for provocative, healing conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does Valdes&rsquo;s theory conclusively determine that Queen Charlotte had African forebears? Hardly. And if she had African forebears, would that mean we could readily infer she was black? That, surely, depends on how we define what it is to be black. In the US, there was for many decades a much-derided &#8220;one-drop rule&#8221;, whereby any white-looking person with any percentage of &#8220;black blood&#8221; was not regarded as being really white. Although now just a historical curio, it was controversially invoked recently by the African-American lawyer Alton Maddox Jr, who argued that under the one-drop rule, Barack Obama wouldn&rsquo;t be the first black president.</p>
<p>In an era of mixed-race celebrities such as Tiger Woods and Mariah Carey, and at a time when in the US, the UK and any other racially diverse countries mixed-raced relationships are common, this rule seems absurd. But without such a rule, how do we determine Charlotte&rsquo;s ethnicity? If she is black, aren&rsquo;t we all?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s striking that on US and UK census forms, respondents are asked to choose their own race by ticking the box with which they most closely identify (though there can be problems with this: some people in Cornwall are angry that the 2011 census form will not allow them to self-define as Cornish because only 37,000 ticked that box in the 2001 census and that figure has been deemed too small to constitute a separate ethnic group). We will never know which box Queen Charlotte would have ticked, though we can take a good guess. But maybe that isn&rsquo;t the most important issue, anyway.</p>
<p>For congressman Watt&rsquo;s wife Eulada, along with some other African-Americans in Charlotte, the most important issue is what the possibility that Queen Charlotte was black may mean for people in the city now. &#8220;I believe African-American Charlotteans have always been proud of Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s heritage and acknowledge it with a smile and a wink,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Many of us are now enjoying a bit of &#8216;I told you so&rsquo;, now that the story is out.&#8221;</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t her heritage too sketchy to be used to heal old wounds? &#8220;Hopefully, the sketchiness will inspire others to further research and documentation of our rich history. Knowing more about an old dead queen can play a part in reconciliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if an old dead queen can help improve racial trust in an American city, perhaps she could do something similar over here. Whether she will, though, is much less certain.</p>

			<p>Actually, this claim is not new. I recall an episode of 60 Minutes from many years back.</p>
<p>One viewer wrote in to scold 60 Minutes for neglecting to mention on a previous show that Queen Charlotte was black. </p>
<p>60 Minute&rsquo;s response was something along the lines of &#8220;History doesn&rsquo;t mention if Queen Charlotte was black; only that she was fat and ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>This claim sounds like another loopy Black History Month fantasy fiction to me!</p>

			<p>I have always supsected this or something like it.  I can&rsquo;t think of how many times I&rsquo;ve been watching TV and thinking &#8220;Why is Wesley Snipes walking around with Camilla Parker-Bowles?&#8221; only to realize on closer inspection that it&rsquo;s Prince Charles.</p>
<p>As to this portrait, she doesn&rsquo;t look light-skinned enough to be part of any mulatto elite, so the story&rsquo;s probably apocryphal.</p>

			<p>The usual black nonsense that we here about with the ancient Egyptians. Why do they always want to claim the history of others? I think we at AR know why.</p>
<p>Oh, and since when were the Moors black?</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;a much-derided &ldquo;one-drop rule&rdquo;,&#8221;</p>
<p>Not derided by me.  I think it is an excellent rule.  It keeps the whites of America white unlike many of the ostensibly white people of Latin America, especially Brazil.  There are people in Brazil who consider themselves to be white but who clearly have a significant amount of African ancestry and they would not be considered white in America. </p>

			<p>She was not as Black looking as people would have you believe: <a href="/wiki/File_Several_Portrait_of_Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Several_Portrait_of_Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz.JPG</a></p>
<p>She did descend partially from Portuguese royal stock, so it is likely she had partial Sephardic Jewish ancestry, which would have certainly given her an &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; look.</p>

			<p>Typical of shoddy, grandstanding academics who crave attention. A moor is a muslim - a north african, a middle-easterner, not an ebony african! It reminds me of the self-serving &#8220;scholarship&#8221; by the gay community - finding closeted homosexuals throughout history.</p>

			<p> A black queen, indeed! Even if Valdes&rsquo; speculation is true, then so what? It would make about as much difference as the absurd claims that Beethoven was of African descent, or that several unmistakably Caucasian U.S. presidents may have had ancestors who &#8220;jumped the fence&#8221;.</p>
<p> In this world, you are what you look like. If you look   &mdash;   and act   &mdash;   definitely White, then you ARE definitely White. On the other hand, if you have the tell-tale slightly kinky hair, lips a little thicker than the Caucasian norm, a broad, flat nose   &mdash;   then you can call yourself what you want, but you&rsquo;re probably, as my mother used to say, &#8220;a little tetched with the tar brush.&#8221; </p>

<p>On the other hand, the preceeding has got to be the most increduously absurd passage in this entire article. The very notion that Blacks in North Carolina share this &#8220;hip&#8221; secret with their &#8220;Rep&#8221; Mel Watts (from an egregiously gerrytmandered North Carolina Congressional district, NE border with Virginia to Charlotte at SC state line) about dah Queenie needs to be filed alongside the man in the skreet interviews that Saul (one of Howard Stern&rsquo;s sidekicks) conducted in Harlem a few days prior to the election of the Honolulu Beach Boy Messiah.</p>

			<p>Oh boy, what will (or won&rsquo;t) they think of next??  Just more proof that most people see only what they want to see.  And these fools have based all this on portraits like the above?  Too many late nights at the pub, methinks.  She was about as African as Ted Kennedy.  And, just because she had 15 kids doesn&rsquo;t mean she was black.  They didn&rsquo;t have welfare and food stamps back then.</p>
<p>Actually, now that I have looked at the portrait a few times, it looks like Tim Curry wearing a wig (Rocky Horror Picture Show).  Anyone else agree?</p>

			<p>This is just an effort to INSULT, chastise, condemn and disqualitfy Europe, Europeans and their ancestors as a people.  It is a double entendre; &#8220;We got into you long ago,&#8221; and &#8220;You ain&rsquo;t all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>When are blacks going to quit perpetuating the outright lie that the Moors were sub-Saharan black Africans? The Moors were Arab-Berbers and a Caucasian people with swarthy features   &mdash;   not &#8220;black&#8221; in any way but hair colour, perhaps. <br>

			<p>These folk must stop smoking those funny cigarettes. It seems to bring on delusions of the impossible never mind improbable.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve had the current misfortune does that mean these folk are suggesting the Royals get themselves a black girl?</p>

			<p>If this royal personage had African ancestry, how would it affect the behaviour of any normal human being today?  But notice how Liberal Jefferies brings up the possible social betterments that may somehow occur occur. </p>
<p>IMHO Black men just regard this as another way to annoy Whites.</p>
<p>Thanks to massive indoctrination, most White men no longer recognizes his phrases &#8220;healing wounds&#8221; and &#8220;racial trust&#8221; as gibberish. </p>

			<p> With an undercurrent of triumph, the BBC ran a story yesterday that they had discovered that the mother of one of Cleopatra&rsquo;s sister was &#8220;an African&#8221;. Now this is the same outfit that often claims that race is a social construct and has absolutely no validity. This mania for discovering the black ancestry of famous whites is a liberal neurosis.</p>
<p>Do the same controlled media emphasize the white ancestors of  famous blacks?<br>

			<p>Cleopatra was generally pictured as a distinctly African woman, dark in color. Shakespeare in the opining line of &#8220;Anthony and Cleopatra&#8221; calls her &#8220;tawny.&#8221; In his day, mulattos were called &#8220;tawny Moors.&#8221; The word &#8220;Moor&#8221; came into the European languages meaning black or blackamoor. In the Book of Acts, Cleopatra describes herself as &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Her 15 children all had blue eyes and either blonde or light brown hair.</p>
<p>If you see the profile portraits of her, you will see that she had the standard cucumber shaped and sized nose of most European royal families along with the receeding chin.</p>
<p>No on with a nose like Charlotte&rsquo;s could possibly be black.</p>
<p>PS.  The Moors were Berbers, a caucuasian group living in North Africa before the dark skinned Arab invasion.  Berbers still exist in great numbers.  They are a lot lighter than Arabs.</p>
<p>There were a few marriages between native Iberian and invading Arab royals and aristocrats. Al the royals of Europe are related. But one Arab or Berber, not black African ancestor 900 years ago does not make anyone black.</p>
<p>There is an organization &#8220;Descendants of Charlemagene  It admits only people who can prove they are descendants of Charlemage.  It has millions of members.</p>
<p>Ever read the genealogies of American presidents and their wives?  Just about all of them except Kennedy (Irish) and Van Buren (Dutch) are descendants of English royalty.</p>
<p>So were Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you find it strange that they use a <b>single</b> image from the book, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/md/8/moors.html" rel="nofollow">as opposed to the several others where &#8220;Arabs&#8221; are clearly depicted as light-skinned (with some posessing red hair)?</a></p>
<p>And reading the site you&rsquo;ve reference, it seems to be slavishly obeying the myth that the &#8220;<i>Black Moors civilised Europe</i>&#8221;, despite the facts that:<br>
1. All Islamic sources on the invasion - if they mention blacks at all - have them as a <i>minority</i> in the Berber-dominated invasion force?<br>
2. Neither the Arab leaders nor their Berber footsoldiers were technologically advanced beyond the same Goths and Hispano-Romans they invaded and conquered?<br>
3. The &#8220;Golden Age&#8221; of Al-Andalus (Moorish Spain) occurred <i>centuries</i> after the original invasion, at which point the vast majority of &#8220;Moors&#8221; in Spain would be scarcely recognisable from modern Spaniards?<br>
4. &#8220;Moor&#8221; was merely a European term categorising <b>all</b> inhabitants of Al-Andalus - read the chronicles of the various Christian kings of Aragon etc, and you&rsquo;ll find that &#8220;Moor&#8221; was as valid a racial term to them as &#8220;Muslim&#8221; is to us now.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The genealogy of Europe&rsquo;s royalty has been very extensively researched, and almost certainly this particular line of descent was fully known by genealogists long before anyone became interested in whether or not Charlotte was black. And, once again, if the ancestry is, in fact, non-black North African (as is overwhelmingly likely), this is all the less interesting - North Africans were not normally considered racially distinct from Europeans - certainly not in the Iberian peninsula, which was full of Moors and Jews. All of the southern European royalties almost certainly have some small amount of Jewish/Moorish descent through Ferdinand of Aragon.&#8221;</p>

<p>In which Book of Acts is this? Cleopatra does not describe herself as black in the New Testament Book of Acts for the simple reason that had been dead for at least a century when the book was composed. She is not mentioned in the NT at all. Where on earth do you get this stuff?</p>

			<p>Last night (Monday) I watched on the History Channel a program about Hannibal. He was portrayed by an actor who was very distinctly black   &mdash;   Black beyond question.   </p>
<p>However, we know a a great deal about Hannibal; we even have statues that survive of him. The Carthagineans were Phoenicians who came originally from around Lebanon. They weren&rsquo;t even North African Berbers (though they undoubtedly had many Berbers in their troops), but Hannibal&rsquo;s family, like all the aristocrats, was of pure Phoenician descent. They were just as &#8220;African&#8221; as the French settlers in Algeria two thousand years later.   He, like Cleopatra, had no black African blood.  </p>
<p>So much for the accuracy of the History Channel! These media channels will do anything to distort facts and to  pander to black demands for a larger share in history.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She does look like an octartoon in this painting&#8221;<br>
Posted by Anonymous<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
Not necessarily an octroon.   You have to remember that the European royal families were the products of  many generations  of in-breeding among themselves, which went on over many, many centuries.  In truth, they were really all one royal family, with various national branches, but all were closely inter-related.   They knew nothing about genetics back then, of course.   </p>
<p>The result of this incestuous in-breeding was a lot of  strange-looking and often rather ugly individuals.  Also, there were genetic  illnesses like hemophilia and  inherited deformities like the Hapsburg jaw.   And a streak of idiots and insanity as well.  Look at old paintings of monarchs and their families. There may have been a few, but  I can&rsquo;t think of one that was good looking! </p>
<p>They were, in all, a pretty scroungy lot who controlled the destinies of nations.  Pathetic!  Without their inherited titles and privileges, most of them would have been criminals and scavengers.  Many of these monarchs did not have the wits or interest to run their kingdoms and had to leave it to prime ministers who were more able than they. Those that proved unusually capable, like Queen Elizabeth, were often the product of an infusion of outside blood.  Elizabeth got her brilliance from her mother&rsquo;s side, the Boleyns; her grandfather, Thomas Boleyn, was a noted scholar and diplomat.  Louis XIV marveled at the good looks and intelligence of the illegitimate children  he had  by his mistresses,  and was mystified why his legitimate royal offspring were so disappointing.   (Well, obviously, his mistresses had been picked for their good looks, poise, and charm.  His wife, a dull Spanish princess, like his mother,  had been picked for her royal connections.)   </p>

<p>The controversy surrounding Queen-Consort Catherine of Braganza has nothing to do with her alleged African ancestry (and this is the first time I&rsquo;m hearing of this).  The government of Portugal wished to erect a 35-foot tall statue of her in the borough of Queens, NY supposedly because the place is named in honor of her (a fact disputed by many historians).</p>
<p>So-called &#8220;African-American leaders&#8221; came out against the idea immediately (&#8220;She owned slaves!&#8221;).  Irish-American leaders didn&rsquo;t want a statue of a 17th century British monarch overlooking a cemetery (Calvary) filled with Irish immigrants.  Some local historians also thought it would be in poor taste to put a statue of a British monarch so close to the site of a Revolutionary War battle (Kips Bay).</p>
<p>http://www.queenstribune.com/anniversary2003/queenscatherine.htm</p>
<p>American Renaissance never ran a story on Catherine&rsquo;s alleged African ancestry.  This is what they actually wrote.</p>
<p><a href="/ar/1997/10.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/1997/10/</a></p>
<p>Like Queen Charlotte, there appears to be a disagreement among painters contemporaneous with Catherine over what she actually looked like.</p>

Kindly note, however, the first three portraits (all painted by Englishmen, by the way) show a dark-haired, dark-eyed, light-skinned woman with facial features quite typical of an Iberian female.  The first two paintings are also strikingly similar (in terms of the subject&rsquo;s appearance).  It is only the last that shows an African-looking woman.  For those reasons, I find the last hard to swallow.</p>

Thank you for your links. You obviously have more information on this than I do, and I apologize if I was mistaken in any details. I was writing this from memory, but I definitely remember reading about this here within the past 2 or 3 years. There was a picture of the statue, which was deliberately made to be as a bi-racial  (or non-specific) as possible.  It seems to me, as best I recall it, that some groups found it offensive, showing her as a mulatto, while others found her not &#8220;black&#8221; enough. And you&rsquo;re right that many other side issues came into the dispute as well. No one was satisfied with the statue.  </p>
<p>Perhaps someone else here can remember the actual discussion.  Possibly it was not an article of its own but was discussed within the context of another article. I  certainly read about here; I don&rsquo;t know how I would know it otherwise.  I still clearly remember the picture of the statue which presented her as rather lumpy-featured and racially vague&hellip; purely the sculptor&rsquo;s fantasy image, meant to please all but which pleased none.<br>

<p>That Irish immigrants would disrespect Catherine of Braganza would seem the height of ignorance and ingratitude, since she was not only a Catholic queen, both of England AND Ireland, but was the  protectress and leader  of Catholics in the British Isles (including Ireland). <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
  &#8220;King Charles II of England married Catherine, Infanta of Portugal, by proxy in Lisbon, on 23rd April 1662.  On the wedding day in Lisbon, a  full length  portrait of King Charles, was carried through the streets as part of the public celebration. Apart from the solemn Catholic matrimonial mass in the great Abbey of St.  Jerome, there was a stately procession passing under triumphal arches, followed by a bullfight and later an aquatic carnival with fireworks. </p>
<p>The affable King&rsquo;s personal popularity was high, and his Queen, despite her Catholicism, basked in reflected glory.  Charles had been crowned well before her arrival, in order to avoid the difficulty of crowning a Catholic.  [In her portraits], portrayal as a Saint, carrying a martyr&rsquo;s palm, and kneeling on a broken wheel, reveals that she had dedicated her life in devotion to her religion.  The lamb is associated with innocence, gentleness, patience and humility. It is also symbolic of Christ the shepherd, and with his sacrifice for mankind.  Catherine had all the foregoing qualities, and she may have identified particularly with the Good Shepherd in her duties <b> as leader of the Catholic faith in England.</b><br>
  <br>
Her childhood had been spent in a convent, and upon her marriage,  she saw her duty in England to be  <b>protector of the Catholic faith.   </b> It had been one of the conditions of the marriage treaty that she would be allowed to practice her religion in England without interference&hellip; her chapels at St. James&rsquo;s and in Somerset House were the only places in London where Catholics could worship freely.<br>
When Charles II died in 1685, Catherine, as Queen Dowager, had three years of openly practising her religion without fear while the Catholic James II was on the throne.  After James&rsquo; exile in 1688, however, under William and Mary, all Catholic chapels were closed, Catherine&rsquo;s household was drastically reduced, and she was hounded into meaner accommodations. For a number of years she felt it her duty to stay on and  <b>represent the Catholic faith in England,  </b>but finally the cross that she had born so bravely against the spiteful intolerance of Queen Mary, became too much, and she managed to get leave from Louis XIV to journey across France to her homeland, the only method of travel that she could afford.</p>
<p>She died in Portugal as Queen Regent  [in 1705]. By then, to English Catholics, she had become something of a martyr.<br>

<p>No, there weren&rsquo;t.   But where did it say they were Moors or anything about Spain?</p>

But where did it say they were Moors or anything about Spain?  It&rsquo;s just an unidentified  picture.</p>

			<p>Thank you, Cassiodorus. I looked up Ivan van Sertima, a Guyanese-British afrocentrist (of whom I had never heard).   Very interesting. It seems he is not well regarded by serious scholars.  </p>
<p>He claims that Africans discovered the New World and were responsible for pre-Columbian cultures (which is considered disparaging to American Indians). He also maintains that the ancient Egyptians were black.  Apparently, much of his work consists of boastful fantasy and wishful thinking, without any credible evidence to support it.</p>
<p><i>[In a] 1977 review, British scholar Glyn Daniel called Van Sertima&rsquo;s work &#8220;ignorant rubbish&rdquo;, concluding that the writings of Van Sertima &ldquo;give us badly argued theories based on fantasies.&rdquo; <br>
Dean R. Snow, a professor of anthropology, in 1981 wrote that Van Sertima  &#8220;uses the now familiar technique of stringing together bits of carefully selected evidence, each surgically removed from the context that would give it a rational explanation.&#8221;  He goes on: &#8220;The findings of professional archaeologists and physical anthropologists are misrepresented so that they seem to support the [Van Sertima] hypothesis.&#8221;</i><br>
