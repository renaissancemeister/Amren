<p>New report finds wage and employment growth for legal workers after Swift plant raids</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (March 19, 2009)  &mdash;  On December 12, 2006, Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel raided six meatpacking plants owned by Swift &amp; Co. in the largest immigration enforcement action in U.S. history. The plants are located in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Texas, Colorado, and Utah. A new report from the Center for Immigration Studies examines the raids and their aftermath. It notes the historical context of an industry whose workers have seen a dramatic decline in wages over the past 30 years as well as the raids&rsquo; economic effects. The report also discusses both positive and negative reactions in these six communities.</p>
<p>The report, entitled, &#8220;The 2006 Swift Raids: Assessing the Impact of Immigration Enforcement Actions at Six Facilities,&#8221; is authored by Jerry Kammer, a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies. Before joining CIS, Kammer was a reporter with Copley New Service, where he won a Pulitzer Prize in 2006. In 1990 he received a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for his reporting on conditions of maquiladora factory workers in Mexico.</p>
<p>The report is available online at http://cis.org/2006SwiftRaids. Some of the findings include:</p>
<p>As is the case in the entire industry, work at the six Swift plants is characterized by difficult and dangerous conditions.</p>
<p><br>
Like the rest of the industry, workers at these facilities have seen a steady decline in their standard of living. Government data show that the average wages of meatpackers in 2007 were 45 percent lower than in 1980, adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>We estimate that 23 percent of Swift&rsquo;s production workers were illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>All facilities resumed production on the same day as the raids. All returned to full production within five months. This is an indication that the plants could operate at full capacity without the presence of illegal workers.</p>
<p>There is good evidence that after the raids the number of native-born workers increased significantly. But Swift would not provide information on how its workforce has changed. Swift also has recruited a large number of refugees who are legal immigrants.</p>
<p>At the four facilities for which we were able to obtain information, wages and bonuses rose on average 8 percent with the departure of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>There is a widespread perception among union officials, workers, and others in these communities that if pay and working conditions were improved, it would be dramatically easier to recruit legal workers (immigrant and native).</p>
<p>Worker pay has a small impact on consumer prices. Research by the USDA and others indicates that wages and benefits for production workers account for only 7 to 9 percent of retail meat prices. This means that if wages and benefits were increased by one-third, consumer prices would rise by 3 percent at most.</p>
<p>Research by the United Food and Commercial Workers union indicates that pay to production workers accounts for only about 4 percent of consumer costs. If that is correct, a 50 percent increase in wages would cause only a 2 percent increase in consumer prices.</p>
<p>Turnover is high at all Swift plants, ranging from 40 to 70 percent per year. Swift accepts high turnover as a cost of pursuing a business model that emphasizes high-volume production. It spends heavily to replace workers rather than seeking to retain workers by slowing production.</p>
<p>High turnover imposes severe stress on local communities and social service agencies. It makes transience and upheaval a constant problem for the communities. Many residents resent the price their community pays to have the Swift plant as a large part of their local economy.</p>
<p>Swift has tried to reduce the employment of illegal immigrants with more rigorous checks of documents presented by new workers. Several months before the raids, the company contracted with the Tucson-based Border Management Strategies for advice on hiring practices.</p>
<p>In addition to pay increases, Swift introduced a number of methods to attract workers after the raids. The company paid bonuses to new employees, and to current employees who recruited others. It also advertised heavily, paid relocation expenses, and provided daily transportation from distant population centers.</p>
<p>Reaction to the raids varied widely within these communities. Many members of the communities were enthusiastically supportive of the enforcement action, while others were sharply critical.</p>
<p>The Swift plants in Marshalltown, Iowa, and Hyrum, Utah, illustrate the immigration connections that were established during the 1942-1964 era of the braceros and extended through the 1986 amnesty. Many relatives and neighbors of former braceros now work at Swift plants.</p>

			<p>I mentioned on a few postings in the past, that I know first hand what happened in meatpacking in Los Angeles. I worked in it in my younger days since it paid well. I was tired of school and needed a hiatus. Once California become inundated with more and more illegal aliens, wages literally froze for twenty years, I&rsquo;m not kidding. That is why I got out of it. The other factor that caused wage freezes and low pay, was Mexican union bosses, who colluded with the company owners to screw the employees. I can&rsquo;t say if this was the rule in every company, but in Los Angeles, it was for many. Illegal immigration is a disaster and it blows me away that Americans would allow the Democrats and Republicans to work together for the amnesty of millions who broke immigration law. After amnesty come the chain migration of millions of relatives follwed by more illegal immigration. Any American who thinks this will ever be stopped by one of the two major political parties is naive. Should&rsquo;nt it be clear by now, that neither the Democrats or Republicans are capable of solving any major problem America has. </p>

			<p>A labor union, the United Food and Commercial Workers&rsquo; Union, is mentioned in this informative piece. What are readers&rsquo; reactions?</p>
<p>Most AR readers are instinctively hostile to the tide of illegal immigration [without necessarily hating the illegal migrant workers themselves, of course] but many are also probably unenthusiastic about labor unions.</p>

			<p>As far as unions, I believe that you have the right to organize if you want.  But don&rsquo;t make unreasonable demands, such as &#8220;pay me quintuple time on Sundays&#8221; or something like that.  </p>

			<p>When the government failed to enforce immigration laws, for various reasons such as turning a blind eye to permit cheap labor to come in to the US, under law a new law was created. This is a rule of equity, where a reasonable expectation is created that there is an exception to the law in the books.</p>
<p>So when we broadly refer to illegal immigrants breaking the law, it is incorrect. After the government made it clear that it would enforce the law, especially at the border; then those who came in broke the law. A distinction should be drawn between the two groups, so that people sense fairness, and will be willing to endorse the position of those who rightly want the laws enforced.</p>

			<p>The NWO just made the politicians of an all white east European country a deal they could not refuse:</p>
<p>1. since the milk industry was not profitable, and was adding to global warming via bovine flatulence the solution was to ship all the dairy cows to Greece.</p>
<p>2. this rewarded Greece with the jobs of a new industry.</p>
<p>3. this prevented the subject east European government from suffering serious financial penalty and sanctions via the EU for GLOBAL WARMING code violations, and</p>
<p>4. made the subject east European government eligible for CO2 credit payments from USA as a trade swap made legal because the subject country has so many trees&hellip;</p>
<p>It all took place this week with the ministers pocketing their money and SIXTY THOUSAND dairy cows being shipped to Greece. </p>

			<p>John Steinback documented migrant farm workers in his book &#8220;Travels with Charley&#8221;. White folks made a decent living picking crops until the illegals came along and undercut them.<br>

			<p>Gee, I thought they were doing jobs that &#8220;Americans wouldn&rsquo;t do&#8221;  I guess Americans just aren&rsquo;t willing to do the work for below-poverty wages.  Gee, how &#8220;selfish&#8221; of us, right?</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of bull droppings about how the economy would CRASH if illegals were deported. The reality would be the opposite. MORE Americans would take jobs for which the corporations would have to offer better wages for. The [American] workers would be earning money instead of getting welfare checks. Regain their self-respect and a bit more spendable income. Taxes would be paid by American workers. A WIN-WIN for our economy.</p>

			<p>A hundred years ago, &#8220;The Jungle&#8221;, a novel about the terrible conditions in the meatpacking industry, was published.  We were assigned the book and our progressive teachers told us about the need for unions to protect workers and health laws to protect the public.  Since liberals eat, they remained concerned about sanitary aspects of meat production, but they never have cared about the working class.  The meatpackers broke the union with foreign labor, and the left applauded.  Bill Corr is right that many of us don&rsquo;t trust unions, because most unions have supported unlimited immigration.  They are pro-left, not pro-labor.  </p>

<p>Truer words were never spoken.  George Bush, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barrack Obama all favor illegal immigration.  We are never given any real choices.</p>
