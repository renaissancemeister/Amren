<h1>The Independent Passes Along Outright Lie About the BNP</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roberta  Woods, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> March 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I just happened to stumble across an article on your website, quoting a piece from the Independent newspaper: <a href="/news/2009/02/alarm_over_rise.html " target="bnp" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"> Alarm Over Rise of BNP,</a> posted on February 23, 2009. I myself attended the Swanley by-election count in question, and was therefore shocked to read of this Labour activist Lesley Dyball&rsquo;s bare-faced lie that BNP members present chanted &#8220;Blacks Out&#8221; when the result was announced.</p>
<p>This did not happen. All BNP members present conducted themselves impeccably throughout, as we always do.</p>
<p>As Michael Barnbrook states below, had this incident actually taken place, there were several police officers present throughout the counting process, and they would have been quick to make arrests. I know you have reprinted this article in good faith, coming as it does from a supposedly reputable newspaper. I am surprised that the Independent did not make further enquiries before going to print, as they must have known of the police presence and that such an incident would not have escaped attention.</p>
<p>You yourself probably know of the NUJ (National Union of Journalists) dictat that journalists must not give the BNP any positive coverage. However one would expect them to stop short of printing outright lies.</p>
<p>We have learned to expect unfair treatment at the hands of our own press, but I am concerned that your readers will now have the same bad opinion of the BNP that has been painstakingly fostered in Britain. Please find below Michael Barnbrook&rsquo;s respone to this gross calumny. The media onslaught against the BNP has now begun in earnest as the BNP are widely tipped to win seats in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament in June, for which I am proud to be standing as a BNP candidate for the London region. Roberta Woods</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Roberta Woods</p>

<blockquote><div class="text-center"><b><big><big><font color="fafaff">Michael Barnbrook, Member of the London Assembly, Calls for Investigation.</big></big></b></div></p>
<p>Michael Barnbrook, Bexley Branch, today made an allegation to the Kent Constabulary Racial Incident unit of a race hate crime.</p>
<p>The allegation relates to an article by Jerome Taylor in the Independent Newspaper published on Saturday 21st February, 2009, reporting the victory of the British National Party in the Sevenoaks District, Swanley Council By Election on Thursday 19th February, 2009. The article quotes a Labour activist by the name of Lesley Dyball claiming that British National Supporters chanted &#8220;blacks out&#8221; after the result was declared at Swanley Town Hall.</p>
<p>Michael was a polling agent at Swanley Civic Centre, where the count took place, between 7.30am and 11. 30pm. He was in the Civic Centre during and after the result had been announced and is emphatic that no such incident took place.</p>
<p>There were three police officers on duty at the count, including an Inspector, a Sergeant and a Constable, who, if such an incident did take place, would surely have reported the incident and made arrests.</p>
<p>The Returning Officer actually thanked everyone at the count for the smooth manner in which it had been conducted.</p>
<p>Michael is alleging that the comments allegedly made by Lesley Dyball, if the article is correct, amount to an intention to stir up racial hatred, an offence under the Public Order Act, 1986. He is asking for a full investigation to take place into the allegations made in the newspaper article.</p>
<p>Michael is prepared to make a statement and attend court to give evidence, if necessary. Michael is requesting that all members present at the count contact the Kent Constabulary Racial Incident Reporting Line on 0800 138 1624 to complain about the newspaper article and request an investigation.</blockquote><br>

		<p>Lies about any group that stands up for Whites or anything other than this multicultural agenda that the &#8220;elites&#8221; are planning and which is now being implemented is par for the course.  Can we expect anything else?</p>

<p>Of course they do, just as the entire MSM does.  They think it&rsquo;s part of their job description to offer lies and denigration to anything that is in oposition to a multicultural agenda.</p>
<p>Newspapers are collapsing left and right, because they&rsquo;ve lost their credibility, but, like the New York Times, they would rather collapse instead of telling the truth or to report in an unbiased manner.</p>
<p>This is just one more important element necessary to disintegration in order to cause the collapse of this entire multicultural madhouse, built on a foundation of lies, manipulation and deceit.</p>

		<p>That same article in The Independent   &mdash;   &#8220;Alarm Over the Rise of the BNP&#8221;   &mdash;   was also accompanied by a photo that misrepresented the BNP.  The photo was not of BNP members at all, but of some members of the &ldquo;Nationalist Alliance&rdquo; (whoever they are).</p>
<p>When the BNP wrote about this on their site, the photo on the Independent&rsquo;s website was CROPPED in what was presumably a clumsy attempt to try to cover up the fact that the shouting skinhead in the picture was not a BNP member at all.</p>
<p>See more at the BNP&rsquo;s website here.</p>

		<p>Boy, do we need a viable BNP clone in the U.S. </p>
<p>The BNP is absolutely amazing in what it is doing.  One keeps watching and fearing that they&rsquo;ll stumble or that their enemies will somehow so demonize them that no one will support them, but so far they&rsquo;ve not stumbled and they&rsquo;ve handled all challenges like pros and come out stronger after each attempt by the anti-white bigots to try to demonize them.</p>
<p>The only thing I can figure is that the BNP has very bright and strong leaders.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, and wonderfully, these leaders keep a pretty low profile and seem to not let their egos get conflated. This encourages the rank and file to take charge and actually make a difference. </p>
<p>I think every BNP member probably believes that the BNP is his or her party and that he or she is responsible for growing the party.</p>
<p>And, even the BNP members who get elected to office still get out in the trenches bringing in new members by handing out leaflets and doing the grunt work. </p>
<p>From where I&rsquo;m sitting, the BNP appears to be grass roots driven by a true &#8220;family&#8221; of members who seem to be working together in harmony for the same cause.</p>
<p>If such a BNP clone were ever started in the U.S., I&rsquo;d suggest that those who start it take some lessons from the BNP.</p>

		<p>If Lesley Dyball really heard BNP supporters shouting &ldquo;blacks out&rdquo; then why didn&rsquo;t she call the police? Doesn&rsquo;t she take &#8216;racism&rsquo; seriously? She should be pressured to inform the police immediately, and then be prosecuted if she makes a false statement.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call this idiot&rsquo;s bluff and see how far she&rsquo;ll go with this lie.</p>

		<p>First Chance the Left gets, they&rsquo;re going to slaughter them.</p>
<p>What? Does anyone think the carnage of the 20th century has done ANYTHING to stop the blood-lust of the Left? It&rsquo;s simply spreading.</p>
<p>What they represent, above all else, is a Psychological illness mobilized into, and presented as, a Political movement.</p>
<p>They routinely&hellip;</p>
<p>Project their own guilt.</p>
<p>Pathologize all opposition.</p>
<p>Demand Blind Obedience.</p>
<p>Despise Reality and its many Unpleasant Facts. </p>
<p>The list is endless, or might as well be. But they all point to why the Left can not ever permit themselves to live in a society that actively, self-consciously, works to promote the basic freedoms that took us 5,000 years to aquire.</p>
<p>In any event, a good example of Projecting Guilt is accusing the USA of &#8220;Imperialism&#8221; when Marx himself ends his Manifesto with &#8220;Workers of the WORLD unite.&#8221; Not to mention the fact that those from the US with imperialists leanings sound and act Left-wing.<br>
When they realized that the Workers in Western Europe and North America didn&rsquo;t want Revolution they moved from Class to Race. They know that the rest of the world comes from corrupt, low-trust cultures that will lie to themselves about Whites and surrender to resentments that are based on those lies.  <br>
And with this sinister, diabolical maneuver, the Left morphed into the hideous, grotesque monstrosity it is today. But because of its shamelessness, compulsive lying and an adolescent obsession with both Quantity (to go with its corresponding hatred of Quality) and Power, it sees nothing bad in this and actually considers it a major victory for, you guessed it, the World!<br>
Where has the Right been during all of this? <br>
Well, the Right doesn&rsquo;t get off the hook.  They are merely the polarized opposite of the Left. The Right thinks local, the Left ACTS global. It took them less than a century to completely devour the Right and render it relatively ineffectual. A point made all too clear in Peter Brimelow&rsquo;s fine article published by his website yesterday.</p>

		<p>Well, the English so-called &#8220;mainstream news media&#8221; isn&rsquo;t any different then the American so-called &#8220;mainstream news media&#8221;. It is mostly propaganda to push agendas and if they have to resort to flat out lies to further these agendas they will do it.</p>

		<p>In USA we understand what it is like to be a whiteout.  Anything that stands for a national heritage founded by white people is automatic whiteout in the global press.. Remember the press is paid. Diversity funders tell what to print.  This is the new boss, same as the old boss  &mdash;    &mdash;   before there was a UK or US. Vickie</p>

<p>Nebulous &#8220;hate group&#8221; designations are much more difficult to combat.</p>

<p>They sure do!  I, personally play my part.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;And, even the BNP members who get elected to office still get out in the trenches bringing in new members by handing out leaflets and doing the grunt work.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called leafleting and the other method is called table sales where we set up our promotional material in designated areas in which there is a by-election happening due to the death of a standing councilor or a forced resignation as a result of gross misconduct or ill-health, for example.</p>
<p>Johnny E.  A few newspaper do disable their comments section, yes. The reasons could be anything from the staff of the editing department not wanting be bothered with monitoring the comments or not wanting to be seen to be giving a platform to organizations they perceive as a threat to the multicultural experiment and deviant lifestyle culture they so promote and support.</p>
