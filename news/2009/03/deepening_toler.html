<h1><a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=4516">Deepening Tolerance Makes British Obama &#8216;Possible&rsquo; Says Putnam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>University of Manchester, March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The UK has the necessary preconditions for the emergence of a black prime minister according to a joint study by Harvard University and The University of Manchester.</p>
<p>The project, to be published in book later this year co-authored by writer Tom Clark, is led by Harvard&rsquo;s Professor Robert Putnam, the author of the best-selling Bowling Alone which charted the collapse of community life in America.</p>
<p>Professor Putnam is also Visiting Professor at The University of Manchester.</p>
<p>It casts new light on controversial comments by head of equalities watchdog Trevor Phillips last November, who doubted that the political machinery of the UK would allow a British Obama to breakthrough.</p>
<p>The &#8220;deepening tide of tolerance&#8221; emerges in survey data covering over 50 years  &mdash;  it tracks attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic towards mixed race marriage, working for a black boss and black and ethnic minority participation in politics.</p>
<p>The findings show that racial prejudice in Britain and America has been declining during that period  &mdash;  chiefly thanks to the greater tolerance of younger generations.</p>
<p>They are released in the run up to the second G-20 leaders&rsquo; summit on financial markets and the world economy  &mdash;  hosted by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and attended by President Obama himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the continuing racial divides in America, we have seen how a slow and deepening tide of tolerance has made possible the election of a black President,&#8221; said Professor Putnam.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, we have seen how a generation of black politicians in America  &mdash;  that goes well beyond Barack Obama  &mdash;  has emerged, and is starting to seize the opportunities this change presents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is fair to say that the minimal representation of non-whites in the House of Commons is surely a significant bar to the arrival of a British Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it fundamental? The most obvious question for Britons is whether the Obama phenomenon could happen in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite some caveats  &mdash;  especially the small though growing black British political class  &mdash;  the answer, according to the researchers is a resounding &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good news is that in terms of the underlying attitudes of the majority, Britain is in the same place as the United States,&#8221; said Professor Ed Fieldhouse Executive Director of The University of Manchester&rsquo;s Institute for Social Change at the School of Social Sciences and a co-author.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it is willingness to work for a black boss or to welcome a non-white person into the family, majority British opinion  &mdash;  just like majority American opinion  &mdash;  is gradually getting more tolerant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Change is taking a similar form on both sides of the Atlantic: exactly as in the US, the generation of Britons uncomfortable with non-whites in positions of power or intimacy is gradually dying off, and being replaced by its more tolerant offspring,&#8221; added Professor Putnam, who was named by the Guardian in 2005 as one of the world&rsquo;s top 100 intellectuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is fair to add, however, that the smaller minority population in the UK, as well as the much shallower pool of black politicians and the more centralized political recruitment paths, still tends to work against black representation in Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the researchers, President Obama was elected in the wake of a sustained rise in the number of black elected officials that can be traced back over several decades.</p>
<p>And in more recent years, there has been an especially sharp rise in number of African American politicians serving non black areas. So increasing numbers of white Americans are now used to being represented by black people.</p>
<p>In the UK, by contrast, there are no records of numbers of non-white councillors until comparatively recently. But the signs are that their total number has roughly doubled from the very low level of the 80s before stagnating more recently.</p>
<p>The UK is thus still without a black political class on anything like the American scale. But its recent failure to grow have less to do with racial prejudice than the fading fortunes of Labour. Non-whites are six times better represented among that party&rsquo;s councillors than among than the Conservatives, and the pattern in all recent local elections has been for Labour to lose seats.<br>

			<p>&#8220;The U.K. now has the preconditions to make a British Obama possible&#8221;,,,,</p>
<p> What an interesting choice of words! I guess after 61 years of having the treasonous Labour party flood the British sheeple with non-Whites the &#8220;preconditions&#8221; now exist. </p>

			<p>Oh NO!!! say it isn&rsquo;t so! Britain&rsquo;s black will also be a MUSLIM! I don&rsquo;t believe for a minute that the &#8220;tolerance&#8221; of native English citizens is increasing, but they better be exceptionally vigilant or this COULD happen to them. </p>

			<p>Obama is so popular in Europe they should just make him king of all Eurabia.  I don&rsquo;t believe they have any kind of pesky birth requirements either.  Come on Europe, prove that you are as progressive as you demand us to be.</p>

			<p>Given the skirmishes between left and right on the streets of Britain, I think it far more likely that &#8220;preconditions&#8221; will generate a new Hitler.</p>
<p>Submit or fight, hardly an ideal situation for what was once a peaceful, prosperous and decent society.</p>
<p>The liberal/left who have foisted this appalling scenario on the British people will not like it when a new Hitler arises, but it will be, as always, entirely their fault.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Tolerance&#8221; (i.e. unconditional surrender to multiculturalism and mass immigration) is not growing among the general populace of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is typical of the pseudo-liberal elites to assume that the rosy view that they see from their ivory towers is - or ought to be - that shared by everyone, including those (the dispossessed indigenous white working class) who lose out most from the present and prospective situation.</p>
<p>And yet perversely, as these cossetted elites would see it, a clear majority (including many longer-settled immigrants) persist in showing a clear and unambiguous opposition to mass immigration, and in particular evince a growing concern at the rapid rise of Islam.</p>
<p>Nationalism will be (indeed, already is) a growing force in the UK as elsewhere in Western Europe. If mass immigration and multiculturalism are not halted and reversed very soon, there will be civil war, and the Muslims will not gain the easy victory they expect. &#8220;Interesting times&#8221;, as they say!</p>

			<p>Putnam is loathsome.  He knows very well what the outcome of the pointless quest for tolerance will be yet he, like all of academia, is such frightful coward he pushes on with insanity anyway.  Has a people ever been led by greater fools than this? </p>

			<p>The election of the anti-white Kenyan bigot Barack Obama has nothing to do with racial tolerance..but everything to do with the new political power of post-1965 non-whites who are now in a position to out vote Native Born White Americans in presidential elections. The invaders are in a position to determine the fate of the European populations of America and England.</p>
<p>Profesor Putnam:when Native english, Welsh,native Scots and NAtie Born White Americans revolt-full-blown-against their racial dispossession, what will you do? It will happen. You are demanding that European peole committ racial suicide in America and Europe. This makes you and every White Liberal the enemy of European people.</p>
<p>The paradox of race-replacement liberalism is that over time, White Liberals will be demographically replaced by very liberal non-whites and therefore&hellip;the end of liberalism itself. So what was the point of the experiment when all is said and done. Liberalism at its core is a sick and diseased  abnormal politically philosophy.</p>
<p>And the more fundamental question Professor Putnam is this&#8221;why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of your program of rapid race-replacement and ultiimately racial dispossession? Because you insist that they do it? You are fundamentally an evil man.</p>

			<p>   Amren posters,do not be to quick to count the British down<br>
  and out.<br>
   For several years I have followed the news about the British<br>
  National Party and have been impressed by both their platform<br>
  and their growing strength.I have often thought that America<br>
  should have a similar party.Well Now We Do.<br>
   The American National Party was recently formed in So.Cali-<br>
  fornia.I googled them up and found a web site still under<br>
  construction with several blank pages but what they have done<br>
  so far is impressive.<br>
   I was really impressed by the large number of letters from<br>
  BNP members telling them to go for it.<br>
   These good people are going to need a lot of help and I<br>
  beleive the good people of Amren,Vdare,etc,etc would be a<br>
  great help to them.<br>
   Any how Google them up and form your own opinion.</p>
<p>   Have A Nice Day.  Unreconstructed<br>

<p>The way things are going, in another twenty years there will be whites - reasonable people, who won&rsquo;t find your assumptions unreasonable. Just what is the assumption, Obama is half black, Black = heapum bad? Heapum bad medicine. Perhaps in another 20 years, you can attract whites in US with this message. I&rsquo;m thinking that&rsquo;s a time-table you&rsquo;re Ok with. </p>

<p>  My assumption Anonymous is that Great Britain is a country far along in the dispossession of its indigenous people. It has become a country ashamed of its own history and cultural heritage. In addition, the British government has eroded traditional British freedoms to the point that it is under a soft form of totalitarianism. Free speech and thought are vanishing. </p>
<p>Unchecked immigration has helped ruin both the character and social stability of Great Britain. Yes, a big government, &#8220;half black&#8221;, poseur like our President Obama is very possible in Great Britain&rsquo;s future. It will also be shorter than 20 years before people in the United States become disillusioned with our current president.  <br>
