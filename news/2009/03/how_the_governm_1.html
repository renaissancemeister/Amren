			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Economist, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A WAR, a riot, a terrorist attack or a row over blasphemy: not long ago, Britain&rsquo;s government knew exactly what to do when a crisis loomed in relations with the country&rsquo;s Muslims. As recently as July 2005, after bombs in London killed 56 people, Tony Blair was confident that he could avoid a total breakdown of trust between Muslim Britons and their compatriots.</p>
<p>Using an old formula, the prime minister called in some Islamic worthies and suggested they form a task force on extremism. Then, hours before the worthies were due to reconvene and mull their response, Mr Blair breezily announced that a task-force of top Muslims had just been created. They moaned, but dutifully went to work.</p>
<p>That system of trade-offs, the equivalent of the &#8220;beer and sandwiches&#8221; once used to woo trade unionists, had some big drawbacks. It gave hardline Muslims  &mdash;  generally male, old and new to Britain  &mdash;  disproportionate sway. It also led to some dubious bargains; for example, Muslim resentment of British foreign policy was parried by, in part, huge generosity towards the cultural demands of some Muslims  &mdash;  such as the right to establish schools where the curriculum bears scant relation to the lessons other young Britons get.</p>
<p>But in its own odd terms, the old system &#8220;worked&#8221;. Messages could be relayed between the corridors of power and the angriest and poorest parts of the Muslim street; and Muslim leaders could be induced to expend personal and political capital urging their flock to co-operate with the police and provide useful information.</p>
<p>Now that system, and its unspoken compromises, lies in ruins. It was jettisoned in the autumn of 2006, when the government downgraded existing ties with the Muslim Council of Britain (in which movements close to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamists of Pakistan were strongly represented) and tried to find different interlocutors.</p>
<p>But attempts to define a new policy towards Islam in Britain have been floundering since then. The Muslim population is in many ways diverging still more from the mainstream. With its large, young families, it is also growing much faster (see chart): there are 2.4m Muslims today, according to the Labour Force Survey; the census of 2001, a rather different measure, put it at 1.6m. The government is under fire from the political centre-right for being too soft on radical or reactionary Muslim groups who stop just short of endorsing violence. It is also attacked from the left (Muslim or otherwise) for using the fight against terrorism as an excuse for a general assault on Muslims and their cultural rights.</p>
<p>Hazel Blears, the communities secretary, sought to clarify official thinking in a speech on February 25th, after a stream of reports that the government was about to launch an ideological war against illiberal or extremist ways of thinking, even if they were not directly associated with violence. The government, she said, would reserve the right to deal with people whose ideas were unpleasant through a &#8220;spectrum of engagement, carefully calibrated to deal with individual circumstances&#8221;. With groups that have &#8220;an equivocal attitude to core values such as democracy, freedom of speech or respect towards women&#8221; there might be &#8220;some scope for limited engagement&#8221;, the minister carefully added. But on certain forms of &#8220;absolutely unacceptable behaviour&#8221;  &mdash;  such as homophobia, forced marriage or female genital mutilation  &mdash;  the government would firmly enforce the law with no regard for a cultural &#8220;oversensitivity&#8221; that had gone too far.</p>
<p>Her speech suggests that a debate within the cabinet on which war to prioritise  &mdash;  the one over ideas and values or the one against terrorism  &mdash;  is unresolved. The government wants to keep its options open.</p>
<p>But the failure of current policies aimed at fostering moderate Islam can hardly be overstated. After spending lavishly on a strategy called Prevent that was supposed to empower moderates  &mdash;  at least £80m ($116m) will have been dished out on such efforts by 2011  &mdash;  the very word &#8220;prevent&#8221; has become discredited in the strongholds of British Islam, which include east London, Birmingham and a string of northern industrial towns. At the Muslim grass roots, there is a sense that any group or person who enjoys official favour is a stooge.</p>
<p>Many in the government, meanwhile, think their partners are not delivering value for money. The whole relationship has deteriorated since August 2006. After a foiled plot to blow up transatlantic flights, and amid huge ire over the war in Lebanon, a group of prominent Muslims, including two now in government, signed an open letter arguing that British foreign policy in general, and its softness towards Israel in particular, was an important factor behind a surge in extremist sentiment.</p>
<p><b>Tripping up</b></p>
<p>Nearly three years on, the government&rsquo;s biggest problem is that it is struggling with two big questions at once. One is the set of problems described under the catch-all term of &#8220;cohesion&#8221;  &mdash;  narrowing the social, economic and cultural gap between Muslims (especially in some poor urban areas of northern Britain) and the rest of society. The second is countering the threat from groups preparing to commit violence in Britain or elsewhere in the name of Islam.</p>
<p>The government says the two problems are related: poor, frustrated and mainly self-segregated groups are more likely to produce terrorists. Muslims as a group lag behind other Britons in qualifications, employment, housing and income (see chart). But in fact the overlap between exclusion and extremism is messy. And attempts to fight terrorism through tougher policing, which can alienate whole communities, make boosting cohesion harder.</p>
<p>Among those who claim to speak for disadvantaged Muslims and articulate their grievances, there has been an outpouring of indignation over the government&rsquo;s stated aim of &#8220;preventing violent extremism&#8221; by making Muslim communities more &#8220;resilient&#8221; and better at dealing with hotheads. The idea seems to stigmatise all Muslims, many complain, while the violent extremism of, for example, the white far right is ignored.</p>
<p>Another gripe is that the Prevent programme has poisoned relations between central government and the city councils through which the money is channelled. Some say councils are being strong-armed into carrying out &#8220;community&#8221; programmes that are really thinly disguised police and intelligence work.</p>
<p>In Birmingham the council&rsquo;s loudest activist, Salma Yaqoob, complains that Prevent money goes only to those who avoid suggesting that British foreign policy helps to foment extremism, even though the link obviously exists. (Indeed, a government security minister, Lord West, admitted in January that to deny it was &#8220;clearly bollocks&#8221;.) Resentment of the gag was exacerbated by the recent Israeli assault on Gaza. Many Muslims followed it on Middle East-based media that presented an even gorier picture of Palestinian suffering than other British viewers saw.</p>
<p>The Gaza crisis also triggered a round of name-calling within the world of British Islam that has laid bare a rapid diminution of the middle ground on which emollient types hope to stand. Senior Muslims at the Quilliam Foundation, a &#8220;counter-terrorism think-tank&#8221; which has received nearly £1m in funding from the home and foreign offices, issued in January a denunciation of Israeli actions that was mocked as faint-hearted by more radical Muslims, while voices on the political right questioned whether the government&rsquo;s &#8220;investment&#8221; in this body was paying off.</p>
<p>Torn between remaking the Muslim community  &mdash;  a task that turns out to be much harder than the designers of the Prevent strategy ever imagined  &mdash;  and simply fighting terrorism, the government, understandably, feels it can hardly be expected to abandon the latter. Probing and pre-empting attacks by Muslim extremists is now understood to occupy about 75% of the energy of the British security services, who claim to have had some success in reducing the number of terrorist plots that are stopped only at the last minute. Another less obvious factor in British thinking is strong American concern over the risk that a British-born Muslim could enter the United States and commit a terrorist spectacular there. A healthy slug of America&rsquo;s anti-terrorism spending goes to forestall just such a possibility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a string of high-profile court cases involving terrorist conspiracies has served to increase the emotional chasm between Muslim Britons and their compatriots. As an example of two worlds diverging, take reactions to the plight of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian who sought asylum in Britain and was later incarcerated in Guantánamo Bay. He says he was tortured by his American captors, with help from the British secret services.</p>
<p>Mr Mohamed returned to Britain on February 23rd, to mixed reviews. For Muslims (and human-rights campaigners on the secular left) his saga is a tale of American brutality and British collusion. In the rambunctious popular press, however, he is portrayed as a nuisance whose presence in Britain will burden the taxpayer and waste the security services&rsquo; valuable time in surveillance.</p>
<p><b>A way forward</b></p>
<p>For all the problems besetting British Islam, however, there are plenty of individuals who exemplify at least part of the solution. Among them  &mdash;  at least until the recession makes it harder for strivers to climb out of poverty  &mdash;  are successful young professionals and entrepreneurs, often women, who have managed to fly high in business, medicine, accountancy or the media. &#8220;We have prevailed in a two-fronted struggle&#8221; against social conservatism and discrimination, says Saeeda Ahmed, the founder of a social-affairs consultancy in the north (to hear an interview with Miss Ahmed, see article).</p>
<p>But successful British Muslims as well as poor ones resent the fact that the rest of society often sees them mainly as potential extremists. Sarah Joseph, a convert to Islam who edits the glossy monthly Emel, says Muslims are fed up with being asked if they are against violence; they want people to know what they are for, such as social justice. The sad fact, in a country that has come to live in fear of terrorism, is that many Britons are indeed more interested in assessing Muslims&rsquo; potential for violence than in anything else about them.</p>

			<p>Unless British voters cast off the mindset that they can only vote Tory, Labour, or LibDem, and embrace other Parties such as UKIP and the BNP, the United Kingdom will bleed away its culture, its heritage, and its history as tens of thousands of Muslim immigrants cut at it. </p>

			<p>As a Briton who has lived in the US for the past nine years, my heart breaks to think of what is happening to my homeland.  I don&rsquo;t understand how the country has let itself go like this.  Whenever I speak to friends and family back home, the message is always the same: the country is falling apart from immigration, especially muslim immigration.  Even my more liberal family members concede that &#8220;things have gone too far.&#8221;  Many native Britons have immigrated (such as myself) because things are so bad.  But I&rsquo;ve determined to go back (as much as I love the US   &mdash;   such a wonderful country!!) to be one of those few who can try to make things better.  I hope other expats do the same   &mdash;   we need to stand up and fight for our country, the way our parents and grandparents, and many generations before them, fought off unwelcome invaders from foreign lands.</p>

			<p>I see, bring in the problem, let problem fester, and then throw hands in air at problem.</p>
<p>Solution: Mass deportations via large capacity airplane for the troublemakers and larger capacity ships for their supporters with a summary explanation about how the West simply will not accept members that subscribe to this culture of violence.</p>
<p>A wink and grin to your brave self, Geert Wilders.</p>

Hate Preacher Anjem Choudary Leads March For Islam in London:</p>

			<p>The Labour party is to blame for all of this. Post-war Commonwealth immigration to Britain was a disastrous policy. The worst decision any British government ever made. It was a great cruelty imposed on the English people. The only real solution is to repatriate all these people back to their home countries. Muslims in Britain are a square peg in a round hole. </p>

			<p>The dhimmi &#8216;Sarah Joseph&rsquo; is a hijab-wearing white Western woman, who went from Islamophile to convert. </p>
<p>In this linked article, white dhimmis who pledge allegiance to  Middle Eastern culture are described as &#8216;reverts&rsquo;, meaning they&rsquo;re considered to have &#8216;returned&rsquo; to Islam after rejecting the &#8220;moral uncertainties of Western society&#8221;.  This suggests they believe Islam is the only true faith.</p>

			<p>Unlike Kevin, I am still in the UK. My part of the country is largely untouched by these issues. He&rsquo;d feel at home here. So far.</p>
<p>But go to Edgware Road in London, just around the corner from Tony Blair&rsquo;s home, and you&rsquo;d swear you were in Beirut if it wasn&rsquo;t for the weather. Sheets hang affront shop premises daubed with Allah/Mohammed/ Prophet Jesus. You feel eyes on you as though YOU are the stranger. And you dare not get out a camera.</p>
<p>I am still an admirer of Tony Blair, and I do not blame him for all of this. But he saw it coming and rather later than he should have. Too late to turn the clock back. I believe he was held back by Labour&rsquo;s Left, those now in charge. Thus we have had 5 Sharia Courts since he left office.</p>
<p>The damage though was done more than 25, even 40 years ago when the liberal British and their governments (mainly Conservative) failed to notice that SOME immigrants were not old colonial Christians or easy-going Sikhs.</p>
<p>In an attempt, genuine if misguided on all sides I believe, to integrate when immigrant workers were needed, we imagined fondly that all incomers would see the benefits of being British first, especially when so much financial assistance was showered on them. I could have told them 30 years ago in British schools that mothers of immigrant children were largely invisible. They were kept at home and did not learn English. Many Muslim boys brought abusive dismissive behaviour to their female teachers.</p>
<p>I could go on. Now, for many of us who thought of ourselves as &#8220;liberal&#8221; the tide is about to turn.</p>
<p>The last straw was Gordon Brown&rsquo;s denial of FREE SPEECH, even denial of UK entry to Geert Wilders. He wanted to tell some old men in an old room in an old parliamentary building of his fears for his country and our continent.</p>
<p>He was denied that, because Lord Ahmed threatened to deliver 10,000 Muslims onto the streets of London if Wilders was allowed into MY country!!! Now Ahmed is in prison for dangerous driving, (mobile texting while driving) which was part of an investigation into the case of a man&rsquo;s death. Ahmed got SIX weeks  - yes WEEKS - in prison! In Iran or Saudi Arabia his head would now be separated from his body. That might just have reduced his odious interference with MY country&rsquo;s codes of behaviour.</p>
<p>This shameful government capitulated to his threats.</p>
<p>With the death of free speech Liberty, the civil rights movement, was of course, silent. They were evidently tied up over a non-British Guantanamo Bay returner. This weekend they met to moan about ID cards. They are throwing them away as an &#8216;infringement of their liberty&rsquo;. Fine. They won&rsquo;t need them any more. They will soon have no liberty or identity.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion for solving this, but sadly there are too few who notice or care about such places as Edgware Road. If you can afford to live in the large houses off, someone else does your shopping. The prayer chants five times a day might remind residents of the state of decline in Churchill&rsquo;s Britain. But double glazing keeps out a lot you will neither want to hear or smell.</p>
<p>If this sounds racist, believe me it is not. I have no racism in any part of me. What I DO have is a sense of my country&rsquo;s history, and pride in my heritage, culture and values.</p>
<p>But I resent deeply that the Left in my country continues to peddle the fundamentalist line that WE caused THEIR radicalism. That it is reactionary. That it is Blair&rsquo;s fault, over Iraq. NONE of that, NONE of that is true.</p>
<p>London is the world HQ of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a group formed before Tony Blair was born, whose intent is worldwide caliphate by stealth. They boast they will go through the democratic system, use it and then abolish it. Democracy is &#8216;man-made&rsquo; and is not valid to these people. The koran tells them so.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders is needed NOW in Britain, and I have written a blog entry that may interest him and other supporters. A comment at a Labour site telling me I need to see a psychiatrist, and recommending one (his own, presumably) has confirmed for me the need for us to take this light-hearted suggestion, or something similar, VERY seriously.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/adys77" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/adys77</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, I hold this government and the conservatives responsible for refusing STILL to lay down an ultimatum to those who declare their intention to fly the flag of Islam over Downing Street. Those like British-born legal/cleric/British educated Anjem Choudary. He who feels &#8216;NO LOYALTY to Britain or to the Prime Minister&rsquo; (quote from 2005, a week after 7/7 bombings which killed 52. He also insisted in that HardTalk interview, &#8220;only Muslims are innocent&#8221;.)</p>

			<p>There is a simple solution: take a copy of the Koran and, wherever it says &#8220;Jew&#8221;, &#8220;Christian&#8221;, &#8220;infidel&#8221; or &#8220;people of the book&#8221; - replace it with &#8220;Muslim&#8221; and then act accordingly.  In other words, however a Muslim society would treat non-Muslims, that&rsquo;s how Britain should treat Muslims.  They will then willingly return to their native lands.</p>

			<p>The BNP are doing well, unfortunately, there is so much voter fraud Britain is very much like a Banana republic now.<br>
The BNP could probably do quite well, even have some MP&rsquo;s if there was not so much fraud, for example, in the London Mayoral electiosn where BNP gained a seat, there were 500,000 Dissallowed votes, I wonder who those votes went to.<br>
The Only way they will be allowed to win is if they simply cannot be stopped and the stream becomes a Torrent of BNP support.</p>

			<p>What to do about the Moslems. Try rounding them up and deporting them.</p>

			<p>      There is alot of half misunderstanding here. For one, just<br>
because an individual Muslim is lukewarm about his faith doesn&rsquo;t<br>
make him a moderate. He may very well support the terrorists-it&rsquo;s<br>
just that he&rsquo;s not about to blow himself up. There are no moder-<br>
ate Muslims in the sense of being equivalent to Unitarians or<br>
Episcopalians. If you want those, you are going to have to create<br>
them. And yes, our system is good at enticing people to give up<br>
their values. There are obviously some newly created &#8220;moderate&#8221;<br>
Muslims. But most Muslims don&rsquo;t accept them as Muslim. So the<br>
question becomes, can the West create eneough of these fake Mus-<br>
lims to change the whole religion in the West? I doubt it very<br>
much. Since the survival of our Culture is at stake, it&rsquo;s is truly a fool&rsquo;s gambit.<br>
     As far as Traditional Muslims who are less extreme-yes there<br>
are some. The Sufis are the best example. But they don&rsquo;t have lots of money and are not the ones coming here typically. And in<br>
there own lands, the moderate groups have lost tremendous ground<br>
to the the extremeists all over the Muslim world. And again mod-<br>
erate needs to be taken with a grain of salt. For example, tra-<br>
ditional Sufis don&rsquo;t believe in equality for women and some of<br>
them are jihadists as well.</p>

			<p>Binyam Mohamed fled violence in his native ethiopia and claimed asylum, as a child, in UK. He is not British. He lived here for a short while but travelled to pakistan, ending up in Guantanamo. Bit of a mystery as to what travel document he used. He recently arrived in UK claiming he was tortured and that British Security were complicit. If this is true, surely he would be too frightened to come to UK? There are around 2.4 million of his muslim brothers and sisters in UK, many of them running hotels, restaurants and similar enterprises and some are very rich indeed. Not one has offered him a bed, a roof over his head or daily food. Somehow he has gathered a &#8216;team&rsquo; of lawyers and is claiming benefits amounting to many thousands of pounds from the White English taxpayer to cover food, housing and living expenses. To say this is an islamic conspiracy is stating the obvious. Just one more tool in the &#8216;gaza&rsquo; mentality of muslims with which to batter our weak government. He should be expelled back to ethiopia, along with his new beard, white skull cap, white trainer shoes and other assorted islamic gang colours.</p>

			<p>Britain, with its extremely low native birthrate (thanks in part to safety concerns stemming from immigrant communities), must, without exception, elect a government to get rid of immigrants within the next 15 years.  If they choose not to, they could be in a situation akin to that of the United States.</p>

			<p>One word solution: EXPULSION. That means that every Muslim leaves, period.</p>

<p>In other words, they&rsquo;ll only be happy (and stop killing you) when they get their way politically. How&rsquo;s that for democracy? A group that makes up less than 5% of Britain&rsquo;s population gets veto power over foreign policy.</p>
<p>How &#8216;bout this? If you don&rsquo;t like it, leave. If you can&rsquo;t support Britain&rsquo;s foreign policy, and it makes you really, really angry, then go to a country whose foreign policy you can feel good about. You or your parents weren&rsquo;t invited here. In fact, <i>you</i> begged to come here. You don&rsquo;t have to remain here. In fact, I really think you would be happier someplace else.</p>

			<p>So the Brit&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t figure out how to deal with Muslims? All they need to do is check their history books and read about the Crusades. Or, maybe the modern PC history books of today left out the tiny little detail that it WAS a war against Muslims.</p>

			<p>The government and muslims have created this problem.</p>
<p>Now, no British people want anything to do with muslims and will vote for the BNP next time around.</p>
<p>The next two years, fuelled by economic disasters, terrorism and the increasingly anti-white/christian policies of New Labour is seeing the general populace radicalised as never before.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t want them here, we want them sent back.</p>
<p>The BNP is the only Party that has the balls to do that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarah Joseph, a convert to Islam who edits the glossy monthly Emel, says Muslims are fed up with being asked if they are against violence; they want people to know what they are for, such as social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
And the Muslim idea of &#8220;social justice&#8221; requires violence. Violence against everyone and everything that is non-Muslim. Their &#8220;holy book,&#8221; the Koran, spells that out clearly and unambiguously. </p>
<p>So whenever you hear Muslims start talking about &#8220;social justice,&#8221; be sure you know where the keys to your gun cabinet are.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that&rsquo;s good advice for whenever ANYBODY starts talking about &#8220;social justice.&#8221;</p>

			<p>So over 4% of the British population is now muslim (see bar graphs above), an increase of over 1% in 4 years. The number of young people is well over this percentage, attaining over 8% in the 0-4 year age group. From these figures it is certain that the muslims will increase their proportion of the population. Add to this the certainty that increasing numbers of indigenous Britons will flee to Christian counties, and the muslim take-over of Britain will be realized sooner than we think.</p>
<p>The only solution is a preferably non-violent ethnic cleansing of the islands.</p>

			<p>OK, great, squeaky wheel gets the oil.  But, what about the millions of black Africans or Hindus or whatever else banging at the door or already in?  Just because they speak English, or are Anglican (remember, now a majority black denomination) or are liberty loving sons-of-guns does not make them compatible with the majority of native Britons.  If you just want to bash Muslims or relearn (and relearn, and relearn&hellip;) the &#8220;lessons&#8221; of WWII, there are myriad websites out there catering to you.  But AMREN is dedicated to issues concerning those of White European descent, and I&rsquo;m just not convinced that this brutally narrow focus on obnoxious Muslims will do anything more than distract us from other, possibly greater threats.  Mark Steyn always writes about how much higher birthrates are in the Islamic world, while carefully ignoring the fact that birthrates in Black Africa are even higher.  An all-out global war with Muslims may leave us in the same shambles that had 1948 Britain inviting boatloads of &#8220;friendly&#8221; West Indians.  </p>

			<p>All you really have to do is expel the criminals once plus anyone that came in on that visa.  Seeing that this is 80% of the population of 3rd world immigrants the problem goes away.</p>

			<p>&#8220;At the Muslim grass roots, there is a sense that any group or person who enjoys official favour is a stooge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this not the same as the &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; stigmatization that Blacks in America use to marginalize every civilized member of their race?</p>

			<p>To BlairSupporter</p>
<p>Anyone who imagines for a moment that Tony Blair had the slightest objection to mass immigration (especially that of Muslims) and multiculturalism is quite simply delusional. </p>
<p>His ten years in office set in train the greatest mass migration to Great Britain in history, numerically (if not yet proportionately) greater than that of the Anglo-Saxons themselves (the founders of the English language and nation). To blame this on &#8220;left-wing&#8221; factions within his own party is simply nonsense.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Britain can&rsquo;t figure out how to deal with Moslems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well now, this is rather strange. It seems Britain used to be very confident, almost arrogant, on how it could deal with almost anything. I remenber the expression,&#8221;we&rsquo;ll muddle through.&#8221; What happened? I submit that it isn&rsquo;t that the British populace couldn&rsquo;t deal with it, but rather the treasonous leadership and Britains elite, can&rsquo;t deal with it and really doesn&rsquo;t want to. This is what happens when you have a nation of secular humanists, basically, living with people who have  strong, not to say fanatical religous convictions. Good luck.</p>

			<p>This is all good.  As one British poster above admitted, he used to be a liberal.  Well, it&rsquo;s a bit late to be seeing the light now, isn&rsquo;t it?  I think liberal Britons, and there are many of them both over there and over here, need to be served up a catharsis that is every bit as bracing as the Battle of Britain back in 1940.  They need to face the carnage of their racial catastrophe in every corner and every home.  They need to see with their own eyes what they have done to themselves and their progeny.  It needs to be the sort of lesson that will reverberate down the long halls of history.  Britain is not ready to take the steps that will end with deporting non-natives.  For that to occur, tragedy must first take precedence. </p>

			<p>Reagarding the above graphs:<br>
Pssst&hellip;I&rsquo;l let you into a secret regarding the low birthrate of indigenous Anglo-Saxon and Celtic Britons. <br>
&#8220;We know what is coming and we have no wish to see our offspring living in a country rapidly and inevitably colonised by foreign diasporas and there is nothing we can do about it as we have been gagged by a decade of legislation. <br>
