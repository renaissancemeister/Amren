<h1>Dallas Judge Criticized for Racially Charged Quote</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The top municipal judge in Dallas faces calls for his resignation over a racially charged column he wrote in a weekly newspaper.</p>
<p>Administrative Judge C. Victor Lander apologized Tuesday for writing in the Dallas Weekly that &#8220;black folks have been cleaning up white folks&rsquo; messes for hundreds of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lander, who is black, said he wrote the column earlier this month to praise reform efforts of the city&rsquo;s first black prosecutor, Craig Watkins.</p>
<p>A member of the Dallas City Council isn&rsquo;t buying the explanation  &mdash;  calling for Lander&rsquo;s resignation. The council appoints municipal judges in Dallas.</p>
<p>Lander has been a municipal judge for 12 years.<br>

			<p>Does this modern day Thurgood Marshall have any examples of black people cleaning up whites messes?  I would think no.  Anyways nothing will happen to this guy, as a black politician he knows that berating &#8220;whitey&#8221; is the best way to garner black support.</p>

			<p>Typical black judicial employee.  Give them a wee bit of power and they become even more irrational.  What messes?  They don&rsquo;t clean up their own and he&rsquo;s claiming they clean up ours?  Nonsense.  These folks are full of themselves.  In trying to boost their self-image (which is very hard to do with truth and reality), Liberal whites have pumped these half-wits with foolish nonsense at the sole expense of their fellow whites who have been looking the other way for decades at their own peril.  This must stop soon!<br>

			<p>We will see how long it takes Dallas to go down the drain as it transitions to more black rule. I hope the force behind his being asked to step down to kept up and made loudly.</p>
<p>There are only a few places this will be mentioned and criticized as hate speech. Those places will be called &#8220;white supremists&#8221;</p>
<p>I only wish the man could name one single place a black leader has cleaned up after a white man.</p>

			<p>The truth of his quote doesn&rsquo;t sound very accurate. Not at all. But it does a lot like the usual racial cheerleading. The kind every liberal in this country seems obsessed with and considers &#8216;enlightenment&rsquo;.   </p>

			<p>Sounds like another delusional Black spouting the usual gibberish.   Black neighborhoods are riddled with litter; Blacks are slovenly.  Every company that has multiple or more Blacks in a department needs a White person to clean up the mess due to their collective incompetence and laziness. If we continue on our present course can you imagine what they&rsquo;ll be saying in 25 or 50 years?</p>

			<p>When are they going to get around to cleaning themselves up, because brining blacks to America is unquestionably the biggest mess whites ever made.</p>

			<p>I too would like to know what &#8220;messes&#8221; of whites blacks have been &#8220;cleaning up for hundreds of years.&#8221; The original article gives no details, nor a link to the judge&rsquo;s original column, but I would guess it has something to do with the old canard that &#8220;blacks built this country.&#8221; The irony of this silly claim is that it seems to be justifying the existence of slavery, since, without it, this nation apparently would never have existed. In reality, of course, this nation would have been far, far better off if we had never stepped into the Dark Continent. In any event, this judge shows the tendency of many blacks: to say things that are the exact opposite of reality.</p>

			<p>This guy shouldn&rsquo;t be a judge because he&rsquo;s a bigot, he shouldn&rsquo;t be a judge because he has shown he&rsquo;s an ignorant moron.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Black judge: Blacks have been &ldquo;cleaning up white folks&rsquo; messes&rdquo; for centuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, he has every right to say that.  I mean, look at how efficiently Detroit is run.  New Orleans too, and don&rsquo;t forget about the low crime rate by blacks in all the urban areas, not to mention that they don&rsquo;t drop out of school because they can&rsquo;t grasp fundamental concepts and go on to be engineers, scientists,  doctors, psychiatrists, and on and on.  And they do all this on their own in spite of white racism.</p>
<p>Remember also that they built the pyramids, invented the helicopter and ball point pen, to say nothing of millions of other things the white man denied them credit for and kept it all covered up.</p>
<p>And whites have the nerve to say they aren&rsquo;t racists, because they elected a black man president.  Well, we all know that&rsquo;s just another way to put a black man in public housing.</p>

If they don&rsquo;t like cleaning up our mess, why do they insist on being around us?</p>
<p>One would think that if blacks believed anything they said about whites, they would want to be as far away from whites as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another example of cognitive dissonance that most people don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Blacks know they descend into chaos when it&rsquo;s just them which is why their entire sense of self-worth is dependant on their proximity to whites. The first thing a black man does when he has the means is to leave the &#8216;hood and head for white communities. A black man knows he&rsquo;s made it when he&rsquo;s left blacks behind and can boast of living in a white community.</p>
<p>Then he does something really stupid. He tells his friends how great it is and invites all the people he left behind to come to join him in the white mans paradise.</p>
<p>The mind of a black man is a terrible thing.</p>

			<p>Broadcaster Don Imus shot off his mouth on air making a bad joke about a college&rsquo;s female basketball team that was mostly black.  There was no malice intended, only locker room banter that went too far.   Imus made  numerous apologies to the victims of his joke on the air and actually went to the school to apologize in person. However, Imus was not let off as easily as blacks who frequently make nasty remarks about whites like the judge in this article.<br>
It seemed the whole black community, incluyding Al Sharpton, rose up and demanded that Imus be fired from his long running talk show program.  The involved network finally gave in to the mounting pressure by the black community and fired Imus.<br>
Like most things in dealing with the black community there is a double  standard.</p>

			<p>From what I see every time blacks come to dominate a neighborhood, school, or city they ruin it.  Then they expect white people to come in and clean up the mess.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a process called &#8220;affidavit of prejudice&#8221; to make sure your case isn&rsquo;t heard by a particular judge. Whites charged in this guy&rsquo;s muni court would be on solid ground to file an affidavit of prejudice.  All whites&rsquo; cases would have to be heard by another judge, and eventually the voters would get rid of that guy.</p>
