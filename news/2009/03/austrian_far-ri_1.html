			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Austrian far-right parties have made gains at the cost of the governing Social Democrats in two regional polls.</p>
<p>In Carinthia, the main winner was the Alliance for the Future of Austria of the late Joerg Haider, with 45.5%. The Social Democrats trailed with 28.6%.</p>
<p>The centre-left Social Democrats also lost ground in Salzburg, but still came first with 39.5%. The far-right Freedom Party won 13% there.</p>
<p>The far-right gained nearly 29% of the vote in September&rsquo;s general election.</p>
<p>However, neither the Alliance nor the Freedom Party were invited to join the reconstituted coalition government formed two months later by the Social Democrats and the conservative People&rsquo;s Party.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s regional elections in Salzburg and Carinthia were the first to put to the test the popularity of the government, which has focused in recent months on dealing with the problems confronting Austria in the face of the global economic downturn.</p>
<p>Correspondents say that in Carinthia the Alliance had led a campaign focused on the legacy of Haider, who was the state&rsquo;s governor for 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will look after your Carinthia,&#8221; the party&rsquo;s posters said.</p>
<p>Haider was killed in a high-speed car crash near Klagenfurt last October. His blood-alcohol level had been well above the legal limit.</p>
<p>He became a potent force in the 1980s and 90s, championing what he called traditional family values and an end to immigration.<br/>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t George Wallace have something to say about dime&rsquo;s worth of difference?  I&rsquo;m presuming that this is the equivalent of the American Democrats and Republicans, so when someone comes along who is a real threat to the system, and wants to solve the whole problem instead of arguing about which half of the problem to solve, then these supposed &#8220;enemies&#8221; will show their true One Party colors and close ranks.</p>

			<p>When are we going to have a viable far right party to represent the intersts of European Americans?  Or, are we just going to have more and more message boards like this with no outlet for our people to actually join something that has a chance of winning some elections  &mdash;  at least on the local level at first?</p>
<p>Where are the white leaders who actually have some consciousness of the genocide against whites that is going on right now in this country?</p>

			<p>Austria is probably one of the most stubborn and trenchant nations in Europe, when it comes to allowing outsiders to kick it around. I remember several occasions when the populace was pressured to support something they absolutely did not want, and they didn&rsquo;t support it.</p>

<p>A British economic writer on Lou Dobbs tonight said Europe and Asia are in far wose condition that the US is right now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only one of many who say the same thing, so there&rsquo;s no reason to believe otherwise.</p>
<p>Consequently, I imagine Europe is going to see many right leaning groups, including the BNP, do extremely well in the elections from this point forward for the next five years.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be the multicults worst nightmare if the entire European Union was dominated by these groups?</p>
<p>The way things are going it&rsquo;s a very real possibility.</p>
<p>How entertaining it would be to read about a multicult who went on trial for slurring white Britons or demeaning white history someway.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t really suggest to me an increase (or, in any case, more than a slight increase) of support for &#8220;right-wing nationalists&#8221; in Austria.  We should all know that local people will continue to romanticize a popular resident long after his death, so the situation in Carinthia is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Again? More gains?<br/>
I hate to sound the pessimist, but we&rsquo;ve been reading this for years now. It&rsquo;s the same with the BNP and all the other European rightist parties.   They are always gaining &hellip; but somehow never get there.  After all those &#8220;gains&#8221;, where is a right-wing party in power anywhere right now?  </p>

			<p>To which we can only say &#8220;THANK GOD SOME PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THEIR SENSES AGAIN.&#8221; Europe, admittedly, got a bad rap in the aftermath of WWII. With every country trying its best to distance itself from Naziism and to avoid being termed racist.</p>
<p>The inevitable result? Europe being overrun with Muslims and African Blacks. With people AFRAID to speak out against this moral outrage for fear they&rsquo;d be regarded as racists, or labeled &#8220;neo-Nazis&#8221;. But if Europe fails to wake up and take a get-tough stance with immigrants, European culture will be submerged in a new Dark Age (no pun intended). With the White face a minority in a sea of brown and black faces.</p>

<p>Looking at the results, as they exist <i><b>right now</b></i>, what success does the BNP have to show us that Americans would want to copy?  </p>
<p>Sorry to sound harsh, but from what we read, all it has thus far ACCOMPLISHED is to get its members fired, threatened with jail, taken to court, socially ostracized, and gotten generally into a lot of trouble.  And all for what?  Where are the <i>results</i>?</p>
<p>I wish them the very best, but at the moment, all they offer is more pie-in-the-sky.</p>

<p>The leaders have always been there. Some of them have taken great personal risk and have recieved only ridicule, being shunned or even death as their reward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the followers who have failed to come forward.</p>
<p>As long a people have the option of an easy life, always expect them to be cowards who refuse to stand up for the principles that have built our societies.</p>

<p>It really is different now. Italy is governed by a nationalist coalition that is clamping down hard on immigration abuse. In Denmark, in order to support the present right wing government the Danish People&rsquo;s Party (26 of 178 seats) has insisted on a very strict policy towards immigrants and refugees. Nationalism in Europe is significantly on the rise in every single country despite the pro-EU mainstream media demonising nationalist parties throughout the EU. The Euro elections are due on June 4 and I expect more nationalist MEPs (including BNP candidates) to be elected. The people have had enough of the neo-Marxist EUSSR with its open borders work and mass immigration policies and some governments are being forced to curtail the flow of workers from other EU countries due to huge unemployment which is only going to get worse. Below is a link to an article in which the great Czech President Vaclav Klaus has a go in the EU parliament at the neo-Marxist politicians who control the EU, comparing them to Soviet-era Communists.</p>

<p>Actually their worst nightmare would be the total dissolution of the EU. I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if it happened in the next few years.</p>

<p>You do not have to be a member of the BNP to come under attack from liberals. It&rsquo;s can happen to anyone who is outspoken on the subject of race and immigration. The point is that the BNP has survived and is getting stronger. </p>
<p>Opposition to immigration is not confined to a minority.<br/>
Liberals know that. That is why they are starting to worry.</p>
<p>Even the normally somnolent  Archbishop of Canterbury is getting agitated, as this quote from him shows.<br/>
 <br/>
&#8220;And I think you&rsquo;re quite right to underline that it&rsquo;s no small thing. And as someone remarked to me in a discussion around these issues only yesterday, the fact that the BNP can win a seat in Sevenoaks is a straw in the wind, and we have to watch the horizon very, very carefully for the tempest that might be behind that.&#8221;..</p>

			<p>Things in Austria are not as simple as this article makes them out to be.<br/>
In Carinthia, it was largely a personality vote (even if dead). Besides, the fights against Slovenian partisans after WWI (&#8220;Abwehrkampf&#8221;) before the plebiscite (when even a majority of Slovenians voted for staying with Austria) and during WWII are still very much part of folklore.<br/>
Nationwide, Haider is perceived as having sold out to the neoliberals. The Alliance (BZÖ) is dead.<br/>
Yes, he made the Freedom Party (FPÖ) great; and peace be upon his ashes for it. Yet &hellip;</p>
<p>Salzburg has turned red (socialist) a few years ago, largely due to urbanization.<br/>
Austria-wide, I´d estimate the short-term potential of the so-called &#8220;far right&#8221; at a little over 30%.</p>
<p>Still we remember the EU´s reaction the last time the FPÖ was in the cabinet - ostracism of our ministers, to the point of refusing a handshake. Now there´s democracy for you.</p>

Thank you for your answer.  Incidentally, I find the fact that the Archbishop of Canterbury would take sides on something like this to be very worrisome. Is it normal for British prelates to take sides on political issues?   </p>
<p>In the US, churchmen are generally expected to stay out of politics, this in return for politicians  keeping out of church matters. And for the priviledge of remaining untaxed.</p>
<p>Of course, some don&rsquo;t always scrupulously observe that rule. And black churches are traditionally very political. (But blacks are always exempted from the normal rules anyway.)</p>

<p>Hey, I don&rsquo;t either. I tend to think that it has something to do with economics, rather than culture or race. When Germany united in 1989 I believe, everyone was celebrating and excited and optimistic. You will remember all of the scenes that took place at the &#8220;Wall&#8221;. Reality however, took over when the enormous cost of incorporating 17 million people from the former East Germany into West Germany&rsquo;s economy. It created such a huge drain that to this day many formerly West Germans cannot get along with East Germans, calling them lazy and entitled because of the years of communism. Afterall, in East Germany you could ride the bus for a month to work for 17cents. </p>
<p>This is what probably concerns movements on the right in Western Europe. Incorporating people from the Eastern part of Europe would be a huge strain on the conservative movements finances, that have a hard time getting financing, even in the more well to do Western part of Europe. Mass foreign immigration has not yet hit Eastern Europe, so many people there aren&rsquo;t yet as fed up with it as are those in the west and like the formerly East Germans, make poor conservative recruits. Two and a half generations of communisms pie in the sky propaganda in Eastern Europe created more poets, than realists.</p>

<p>Prelates do speak out from time to time on political matters, and they get criticised for doing so. </p>
<p>One Anglican vicar is (was) a member of the BNP and ran for office in a local election. However, it has since been decided that Church of England clerics should not be allowed to belong to the BNP. I do not know what has happened to him.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately for Austria, I think it&rsquo;s almost at the point where you can say &#8220;The horse has already bolted&#8221;. The major cities are simply so full of foreigners, you can see the old culture gradually disappearing. Unfortunately, there are still many leftists around, particularly in Vienna. The support these right-leaning parties are getting could well be too little, too late. There&rsquo;s an unseen force at work here in Europe and one way or another I think it&rsquo;s going to get its way.</p>

<p> I had thought that Austria - according to what some posters say here - was one of the last white bastionsl left in Europe.  If Austria is lost, then I grieve for England, France, and HOlland which must be far worse gone.</p>
