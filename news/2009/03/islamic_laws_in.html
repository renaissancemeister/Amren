<h1>Islamic Law&rsquo;s Influence in America a Growing Concern</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Lewkowict, FOXNews, March 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As America&rsquo;s Muslim population grows, so too does the influence of Islamic law, or Shariah, in daily life in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shariah Law is the totality of the Muslim&rsquo;s obligation,&#8221; said Abdullahi An-Na&rsquo;im, a professor of law at Emory University in Atlanta. According to An-Na&rsquo;im, {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As a citizen, I am a subject of the United States,&#8221; An-Na&rsquo;im said. &#8220;I owe allegiance to the United States, to the Constitution of the United States. That is not inconsistent with observing a religious code in terms of my own personal behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Shariah&rsquo;s critics point to cases such as the airport in Minneapolis, where some Shariah-adherent taxi drivers made headlines in 2006 for refusing to pick up passengers they suspected of carrying liquor. {snip}</p>
<p>Last year, a Tyson Foods plant in Shelbyville, Tenn. replaced its traditional Labor Day holiday with paid time off on Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim festival  &mdash;  marking the end of fasting during Ramadan. A labor union had requested the change on behalf of hundreds of Muslim employees  &mdash;  many of them were immigrants from Somalia.</p>
<p>But public outcry over the decision to dismiss Labor Day quickly prompted the company and union to negotiate a new contract that makes accommodations for both holidays.</p>
<p>In 2007, the University of Michigan installed ritual foot baths to accommodate Islamic tradition. &#8220;These things are beginning to percolate up as Shariah-adherent Muslims insist that their preferences and practices be accommodated by the rest of the population,&#8221; said Frank Gaffney, founder and president of the Center for Security Policy  &mdash;  a Washington think tank.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Professor An-Na&rsquo;im believes it will be different in America. &#8220;The variety of American secularism  &mdash;  which is much more receptive of public displays of religion and a public role for religion  &mdash;  is, in fact, more conducive for Muslims to be citizens and to be comfortable with their religious values and citizenship than European countries,&#8221; An-Na&rsquo;im said.<br>

		<p>Except that England is secular and Canada is secular, even more so than the U.S., but this does not preclude some Muslims for wanting to pursue Sharia Law as a legal code among themselves.</p>

		<p>Further proof of what I have been saying about the muslim threat to America&rsquo;s way of life. And these foolish black muslims here in the U.S. keep mixing up Sharia law with Muslim, IT IS NOT a muslim thing, IT IS AN ARAB thing. Accomodating the sharia is simply surrendering to a group of people who want to oppress women.</p>

No. Only the US is completely and explicitly secular, and always has been.  England still has a state religion, and bishops sit automatically in the House of Lords. The monarch is the head of the Church of England.   The US has no such thing.  </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say about Canada, or the Queen&rsquo;s position there regarding religion.  I do know that until a while ago they had two school systems in Montreal: Catholic or Protestant, that&rsquo;s all, nothing else.  If you were  of a different faith, or secular, you had a choice of one or the other. (I understand that&rsquo;s no longer so.)<br>

<p>And that religion will soon be MUSLIM, as Obamaster is appearing to want to make the U.S. state religion MUSLIM! He is a sneaky muslim.</p>
