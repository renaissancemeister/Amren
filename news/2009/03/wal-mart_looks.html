<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wal-Mart plans to open its first Hispanic-focused supermarkets this summer in Arizona and Texas as the largest US retailer continues its drive to expand its dominance of the US grocery business.</p>
<p>The pilot stores, named Supermercado de Walmart, will open in Phoenix and Houston in remodelled 39,000 sq ft locations occupied previously by two of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Neighborhood Market stores.</p>
<p>The retailer said that the stores were in &#8220;strongly Hispanic neighbourhoods&#8221; and would feature a &#8220;new lay-out, signing and product assortment designed to make them even more relevant to local Hispanic customers&#8221;. The staff will also be bilingual.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart&rsquo;s Sam&rsquo;s Club warehouse store also plans to open a 143,000 sq ft Hispanic-focused store called MÃ¡s Club in Houston this year.</p>
<p>Several leading regional US supermarket chains already operate Hispanic store brands, including Publix in Florida, which operates three Publix Sabor markets, and HEB in Texas, which opened a Mi Tienda store in Houston in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Leading retailers are also pursuing Hispanic consumers online, with Best Buy and Home Depot having launched Spanish-language versions of their e-commerce sites in recent months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, Wal-Mart also began testing four new 10,000 sq ft Marketside convenience grocery stores in the Phoenix area  &mdash;  its first new format in a decade. Tesco, the UK retailer, also has more than 25 of its small Fresh &amp; Easy markets in the Phoenix area.<br>

		<p>Wal-Mart is looking to be MORE relevant to Hispanics? In my area of everyday life, the Wal-Marts have had signs written in Spanish for years, and people who are stationed at the door to check your receipt, especially if your not hispanic. Of course, the shrinkage Wall-Mart suffers from theft, is well known, so those people at the door need to be replaced. Right?</p>

		<p>Do I hear the word &#8216;boycott&rsquo;, class?  </p>
<p>There are no Wal-Marts near us, but a few years years ago a Target store a few towns away added Spanish to all of their hanging signs (shoes, furniture, home improvement, etc.).  I used to stop in occasionally when in that town, but decided to stop and let the management know why. </p>
<p>My local Target hasn&rsquo;t done this (yet), but I shop at Target as infrequently as possible.  Also, they make blaringly loud announcements in Spanish, just like Home Depot, which we also boycott.  Orchard Supply is much better anyway.</p>

		<p>Wal-Mart is going to create Hispanic stores?  How will anyone be able to tell?  Seems to me that a regular Wal-Mart in a heavily Hispanic area will already be a Hispanic Wal-Mart, this new effort seems a little redundant.</p>

		<p>I live in a heavily Hispanic part of Maryland.</p>
<p>Last year, my local grocery store re-arranged its shelves so that there is now a Latino section.  </p>
<p>Before, everything was mixed together.  Hispanic cheeses with other cheeses, chorizos with sausages, tortillas with bread, etc., </p>
<p>Now, the hispanic foods are all in their own aisles &amp; freezers.  There are even hispanic-branded items like coffee &amp; chinese food!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mind having a choice of hispanic items when shopping. Since diversity is our strength, why do latinos not want to have to consider Velveeta or Chung King when they shop?</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot!  This is not America anymore.</p>

<p>Whore*Mart, or more aptly, Supermercado de Puntamart (given the tone of this article,) is best avoided. Right along with: McDonalds, Coke-a-Cola, and Target.</p>

		<p>Just further evidence that we are going to lose the Southwest. Mestizo populations are also growing in the Midwest and New England states. What might happen in the next 20-75 years is the definition of White/Caucasian will change. Right now, in order to be White all your known ancestors should be white. In the near future people half white and half black/asian/mestizo might be considered white so people won&rsquo;t notice that the white population is dwindling so much.</p>

		<p>I can only proffer the following observation about a store reset and fixture makeover that a local Wal-Mart in NC did a few months back. On the general merchandise side of of this supercenter they widened the aisles by about 25% and redesigned several key departments&rsquo; displays. What I saw from the standpoint of a retailer&rsquo;s bean counter was a reduction of about 25-30 percent of inventory stock on the sales floor of the general merchandise side of the store. Hispanics probably account for 15% of this store&rsquo;s customer base. All of this suggests that Wal Mart is prepping for tough times.</p>

<p>You are correct. Walmart is not doing anything wrong. What they are doing is foolish. The few Mexicans they attract to Hispanic versions of Walmart will be much less than the Anglos that will stop shopping in their stores. Walmart already had the Hispanic traffic, now they want to drive away the Anglo traffic&hellip;.sounds like a net loss to me.</p>

		<p>I agree with other people on here that the place should be boycotted.  I can&rsquo;t understand the appeal of the place anyhow and can count on my fingers the number of times I&rsquo;ve shopped there in my lifetime.  Finding a place to park can be challenging it&rsquo;s very unpleasant and crowded to shop in there with all the hive consumerism going on. Stick to buying locally owned if you can.</p>

<p>You know this isn&rsquo;t such a bad idea. If we are going to have these people invading our country and our stores, I&rsquo;d rather see them segregated into their own ghetto at the grocery store, too. At least that way, they wouldn&rsquo;t be running their disease-laden hands over the food in the sections I shop. Can&rsquo;t we get a &#8220;Spanish-only&#8221; Produce aisle, too? Please!$!$<br>

		<p>&#8220;More relevant to local Hispanic customers&#8221; is code for &#8220;less relevant to the whites who are being ethnically-cleansed from their own neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose none of us should really care.  &#8220;Wal-Mart&#8221; should really just rename itself &#8220;China-Mart&#8221; and have done with the masquerade.  Do they even sell ANYTHING made in the USSA?</p>

		<p>I despise Wal-Mart and everything this monstrosity represents; but occasionally, I&rsquo;ll drop by to pick up just a couple of items.  Recently, I visited our local Wal-Mart to pick up a few greeting cards; and these cards had been re-arranged&hellip;  All of the Hispanic cards were at eye and &#8220;comfort&#8221; level while I had to literally bend down to the lower shelves to see English cards.  Disgusting!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that despite and in spite of the cries of the overwhelming majority of the American people, these global corporations, such as Wal-Mart, with our government&rsquo;s full support will only continue their hard push for open borders and cheap labor until their joint goal of &#8220;globalization&#8221; is absolutely complete; and we&rsquo;re all living under a One World Order.  </p>
<p>This New Global Order of course would be a wonderful bonanza for the few global wealthy elites and ruling class at the top but a total and miserable disaster for the general masses&hellip;</p>
<p>Our politicians stopped listening to We the People decades ago, and America is truly at the 11th hour&hellip;</p>

		<p>So Wal-Mart is looking to the Hispanic Market&hellip; What Wal-Mart NEEDS to look at&hellip; is the vast amount of shoplifting by the Hispanic element. In our local Houston W-M, my wife happened to see a half-dozen Mexicans shoplifting their way along. Security, naturally was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart CLAIMS a heavy amount of stock shrinkage due to theft. They simply need to check the Mexican customers a bit better. Waiting for my wife at another area W-M, I was watching the Mexican door guard carefully scrutinizing the purchases of Anglo customers against sales slips. This same guard appeared stricken with temporary blindness WHENEVER A MEXICAN CUSTOMER LEFT WITH HIS &#8216;PURCHASES.&rsquo; So go figure&hellip; as the saying goes.</p>

<p>&#8220;New lay-out, signing, products to make stores &ldquo;more relevant&rdquo; to Hispanics&#8221;</p>

How a store would go about Hispanicizing its signing and products, I can understand. I don&rsquo;t approve, but I can understand how it could be done. </p>
<p>But how exactly does a store Hispanicize its LAYOUT? Will these new Wal-Martinez locations boast special, extra-wide aisles, so that papa and mamacita and their eight little ninos can waddle along   &mdash;   hand-in-hand, 10-abreast, blocking all other pedestrians   &mdash;   the way they constantly do on the sidewalks of LA?</p>

Posted by What happened <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
That&rsquo;s an interesting pont and could very well turn out that way.  That is the current situation in some So. American countries like Brazil and Colombia, where one white ancestor, somewhere in the past,  makes you &#8220;white&#8221;.   But they have a very different concept of what is meant by &#8220;white&#8221; than our understanding of the word.  To them, any admixture of white, however slight,  makes you white.  </p>
<p>In fact, when you come down to it,  we have already taken the first step in this direction with crime reports labeling obvious mestizos and mulattoes as &#8220;white&#8221;, in the typical Latin American fashion.  They have only to extend that concept. The foot is already in the door.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d venture to guess&hellip; in a way to make SHOPLIFTING easier. Maybe some repackaging so items will &#8216;fit better&rsquo; in baggy pants or under loose clothing. Keep the beer and wine closer to the exists&hellip; so should Jose or Juanita accidentally drop their &#8216;purchase&rsquo;, the mess would be outside the store, hopefully.</p>
<p>Trust me friends, not sure how it is in YOUR area, here in Houston, it don&rsquo;t take much effort, as they say, to see shoplifters in action.</p>

		<p>Well it looks like I&rsquo;ve shopped at Wal-Mart for the last time. Pander, Pander, Pander. Keep it up corporate America and you will have eliminated your core constituents in no time.</p>

		<p>Before being too concerned with Wal Mart you may want to look at the big picture.  I am a white American with strong views about many things however having a Wal-Mart that caters to hispanics is not a threat at all.  I have dealt with the insurgency of MS-13 gang members who killed 2 good friends of mine for no reason.  I have also seen the Social Security offices filled with hispanics bleeding the system dry.  There is little to no effort to stop the hispanic gangs who DO target White Americans as victims.  The Social Security offices will let them get many benefits while denying those same benifits to Americans who really need them. Let&rsquo;s worry about that first then maybe later on we can worry about Wal-Mart.</p>

		<p>Ryan, you&rsquo;re right. The stuff you describe is very serious. So serious in fact, that politicians en masse, should be losing their jobs, when they allow the gangs, the document fraud, and tons of other types of crime to continue. It&rsquo;s hard to make progress, when you have multiculturalism, since any and all benefits &#8220;protected classes get&#8221; that might be threatened, will be immediately challanged by tons of lawyers that represent those &#8220;protected classes&#8221;. </p>

		<p>That is the current situation in some So. American countries like Brazil and Colombia, where one white ancestor, somewhere in the past, makes you &ldquo;white&rdquo;. But they have a very different concept of what is meant by &ldquo;white&rdquo; than our understanding of the word. To them, any admixture of white, however slight, makes you white. </p>

<p>There are two main reasons for the loosening of the definition of &#8220;white.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Number One:  It is high status to be white for many reasons.  Many people wish they could be white, and in South American countries they love to marry white people so that their children will be lighter skinned.  Lighter skin in many brown countries means higher status.  This is sad but true.</p>
<p>Number Two:  Since majority white countries are higher in status (because they are higher in achievement and therefore wealthier) than non-white countries, the census bureaus and politicians will start playing with the definition of whiteness as the white population decreases.</p>
<p>You may ask, why is it more high status to be white than almost any other race in the world?  Because whites have achieved more as a people in every possible level of achievement for humanity, not to mention our race&rsquo;s unique beauty.  If white children are not taught in school how important we are as a people, believe me, those who envy us know.</p>

		<p>I am sympathetic to you gringos, I really am. You built this nation. But the fact it is, you blew it. In less than 50 years you&rsquo;re going to be a minority. This country belongs to whoever can take it.</p>

<p>I take it you are a Hispanic?  Thank you for your sympathy, but we didn&rsquo;t purposely give our country away.  Our politicians betrayed us.  Our factories moved overseas so the rich could get richer.  Our schools brainwashed our children about the goodness of every race except ours.  We are called terrible names for wanting our country to stay a majority white nation.</p>
<p>Whites create superior societies.  You know that and that&rsquo;s why you or your family moved here.  You&rsquo;ll miss us when we&rsquo;re gone.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But how exactly does a store Hispanicize its LAYOUT?&#8221;</p>
<p>I read somewhere that stores do actually widen their aisles for Hispanic shoppers because of their tendency to have large families in tow as they shop.  </p>
<p>You see, one of the main reasons the corporate elite want to replace white Americans is because we average less than two children per couple and therefore we don&rsquo;t consume enough goods.  The corporations are thrilled at the prospect of these new Americans:  recent immigrant husband with wife with six to eight children with aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents all out shopping and buying and consuming.  </p>
<p>Just as MacDonald&rsquo;s restaurants have become very rich because of the numbers served (as opposed to a large profit margin per item), the mega stores hope to do the same as the U.S. population reaches the 1 billion mark by the end of this century.</p>

<p>In my local SS office, they even  call out the numbers and make the announcements in Spanish.   I might as well be in Santo Domingo.</p>

<p>Sad to say, that is absolutely true.   <br>
It&rsquo;s one of the laws of nature, true of every beast, that if you can&rsquo;t hang on to what you&rsquo;ve got, you will lose it.</p>

One billion?!!!!!    We already see what it will be like in India and China.   In this congested, polluted hive of humanity, the rich will doubtless be richer, but it will be a hell for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>I will NEVER shop at Wal-Martinez again. Texas is overrun with both legal and illegal Mexicans who refuse to assimilate in to American society like dozens of generations of immigrants before them that built this great nation. They plan, very openly, to make it so uncomfortable for white Americans that they&rsquo;ll get fed up and leave the entire south west to them. I pay for their kids to get free everything from birth to food to school while they take and take and expect me to learn Spanish to get a F&rsquo;n job. There are more local Mexican/Spanish TV stations than English. It will get worse people. This will end one of two ways. Either fighting and blood in the streets, or white Americans will just give it to them and move to South Dakota. </p>
