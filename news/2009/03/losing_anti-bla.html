<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;We cannot miss this opportunity,&#8221; Margaret Parsons says as she watches delegates at a major conference discuss issues troubling blacks in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot waste it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many black Canadians, Parsons is frustrated and disillusioned by the lack of progress in recent years on everything from jobs to action on ending racism and anti-black hate crimes. That&rsquo;s why she was in Ottawa last week attending the three-day National African Canadian Policy Conference.</p>
<p>Over the three days, 200 legal experts, academics, youth and community leaders went to workshops and listened to speakers on poverty, education, health and the media.</p>
<p>Organizers, including Parsons, who heads the Toronto-based African Canadian Legal Clinic, hope the conference will lead to a national policy with co-ordinated strategies to address critical concerns within the black community.</p>
<p>The timing of the conference was ideal because many black Canadians are feeling increasingly ignored and let down by their public institutions, including schools, governments, the police and the media.</p>
<p>Indeed, for some, this is a community under stress.</p>
<p>In many ways, blacks in Canada have made great strides in recent decades. But in other ways, they&rsquo;ve seen little progress since the 1950s.</p>
<p>As a group, black Canadians are poorer, less educated, less healthy, more likely to be unemployed or in jail than virtually every other racial or ethnic community.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this lack of progress more evident than when it comes to racially motivated hate crimes.</p>
<p>Blacks are the third-largest visible minority in Canada, exceeded only by the Chinese and South Asian communities. And yet 48 per cent of the victims of racially motivated hate crime are black. By comparison, at a distant 13 per cent, South Asians are the second most frequent victims of such crime.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse, anti-black hate crime is on the rise, according to Statistics Canada data.</p>
<p>Hate crimes can include graffiti, oral comments, vandalism, arson, assault, even murder. Incidents can take place at work, in schools, shopping malls and hockey arenas.</p>
<p>Det. Gary McQueen of the Toronto Police Services hate crime unit told delegates they likely will see the numbers increasing even more as blacks come forward to report such cases. Currently, legal experts estimate barely 10 per cent of incidents are reported.</p>
<p>If this is new to readers, then the delegates would be right when they suggest most media outlets downplay or ignore such stories.</p>
<p>During the conference, the organizers gave each delegate a &#8220;tool kit&#8221; designed to help individuals and community groups recognize and deal with hate crimes.</p>
<p>The 78-page manual included tips and strategies ranging from media advocacy to how to raise community awareness and lobby law enforcement agencies to recognize and deal more effectively with incidents of anti-black hate.</p>
<p>It also suggests ways for public institutions to develop training and protocols specifically aimed at handling cases of anti-black hate.</p>
<p>For some older blacks, however, all of this has a sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an understandable attitude, brought on by multiple years of attending such hopeful conferences, followed by multiple years of pain and disappointment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to see how their feeling of despair develops, given that not a single federal or provincial politician showed up, even though the conference was being held just two blocks from Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>Some didn&rsquo;t even bother to reply to their invitation.</p>
<p>Parsons calls the politicians&rsquo; failure to attend or reply to the invitation a slap in the face to all blacks.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s right.<br>

			<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t getting head in liberal race pandering Absurdistan?  If they can&rsquo;t do so in the country that grovels to them most enthusiastically, then they&rsquo;re hopeless anywhere else.</p>
<p><i>Hate crimes can include graffiti, oral comments, vandalism, arson, assault, even murder. Incidents can take place at work, in schools, shopping malls and hockey arenas.</i></p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re talking about hate crimes committed by whites against blacks, then they can include all those things, but are almost always oral comments.  Now reverse the races, and they include all those things, though it&rsquo;s not like Absurdistani authorities pay attention to black on white hate crimes.</p>

			<p>Typical story. Black problems must be solved by conferences and governmental actions rather than by self-help.</p>

			<p><i>The timing of the conference was ideal because many black Canadians are feeling increasingly ignored and let down by their public institutions, including schools, governments, the police and the media.</i></p>
<p>* Descendants of black slaves brought the Americas feel &#8220;let-down&#8221; and &#8220;ignored&#8221;.<br>
* Descendants of West Indian and African immigrants to Europe feel &#8220;let-down&#8221; and &#8220;ignored&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem is still <i>everyone else</i> though.</p>
<p><i>In many ways, blacks in Canada have made great strides in recent decades. But in other ways, they&rsquo;ve seen little progress since the 1950s.</i></p>
<p>Er, isn&rsquo;t that a bit of a contradiction?</p>
<p><i>As a group, black Canadians are poorer, less educated, less healthy, more likely to be unemployed or in jail than virtually every other racial or ethnic community.</i></p>
<p>Must be racism - can&rsquo;t blame people for their own mistakes and all that!</p>

			<p>Margaret Parsons could very well be establishing a political platform to foray into federal politics at some future date, and what better way than to cry &#8220;racism&#8221; in the nation&rsquo;s capital city. </p>
<p>And, if Parsons is sincerely &#8220;frustrated and disillusioned by the lack of [Black] progress&#8221;   &mdash;   though, no fault of White Canadians   &mdash;   then she will  remain disenchanted for the rest of her life. </p>

			<p>Its unlikely many White, Chinese, South Asian and indigenous Canadians have much love for &#8220;underground railway&#8221; people who are said to have helped &#8220;Blacks&#8221; &#8220;escape&#8221; to Canada.</p>

			<p>What? No cringing, pandering white politicians attended Ms. Parsons&rsquo; meeting?  I&rsquo;m shocked!  It must have been held on a Moslem and/or Chinese holiday.</p>

<i>Hate crimes can include graffiti, oral comments &hellip; </i></p>
<p>Stop right there. &#8220;Oral comments&#8221;? So if you don&rsquo;t like what someone said, you are a victim of a crime? That&rsquo;s a new one. Definitely this allows massive expansion of a government Thought Police apparatus.</p>

			<p>There were hardly any blacks in Canada at all until Trudeau let them in. They have been nothing but a crime and social problem since. Like blacks everywhere I might add.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In many ways, blacks in Canada have made great strides in recent decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were almost no blacks in Canada before 1970.  From small numbers in Atlantic Canada, Montreal and Ontario, the population of blacks has swelled to over 600,000 nationwide, due to immigration from Africa and the Caribbean in recent years.</p>
<p>With their arrival there has grown whole industries involved in anti-discrimination, poverty remedies, social services, community policing, remittances overseas, affirmative action in the workplace, and black cultural promotion.</p>

			<p>Where have I heard this &#8221; lament before &#8221; ? Blacks are consistant non-perfromers in any country that unfortunately live in, be it as a minority (The West ); majority, Haiti or East, as a majority, in most of African countries. Anti-black crime are caused by other blacks, not whites, although that is deliberatly left out .</p>

			<p>Blacks have only their large numbers and their unwillingess to do for themselves to blame. </p>
<p>If there were fewer (and of those few, productive and capable) blacks, they would not have to worry about lack of access to facilities, the &#8220;racism&#8221; of whites down on their luck, or people in their own community who prey particularly on successful people of their ethnicity.</p>

			<p>Name one black country on the planet where blacks have peacefully settled, where they are prosperous, hard working, and where they have achieved any advancements be it in science, literature, or ANYTHING. </p>
<p>Wherever blacks govern there is barbarism. That&rsquo;s the only &#8220;product&#8221; they consistently produce. </p>
<p>This lady will get what she wants, however.  All it takes is a little whining and calling whites &#8220;racist&#8221;, and the government money and jobs flow in. Don&rsquo;t believe me? It works in America! </p>

			<p>You live in a predominately white country and you&rsquo;re not white and canadian.  You feel left out?  Big surprise.  A white person would feel left out being in Africa.  A Mexican would feel left out being in China.</p>

			<p>This is so typical of blacks whining and complaining because of a lack of progress. I have been in classes with some black students and, in my opinion, they could not demonstrate an intelligence or level of concentration equal to the white students. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m white and I feel left out. I am left out. I live in America. Although, I&rsquo;m really not all that eager to visit Canada either. <br>

			<p>&#8220;And yet 48 per cent of the victims of racially motivated hate crime are black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: because of seminars such as those, and massive propaganda, blacks are far more likely to complain about anything they perceive as disrespectful toward them.  If a white person approached the authorities complaining about offensive speech toward whites, he would be laughed at and official records would show no such incident.  Hence the numbers are grossly skewed.  Only a fool would take them at face value.</p>
