<h1>UNC-CH to Remember Eve Carson Today</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News&Observer; (Raleigh), March 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year after student leader Eve Carson was shot to death, the UNC-Chapel Hill community will remember her today with a service on campus.</p>
<p>The ceremony begins at 3:45 p.m. at the Pit, next to the Student Union. Chancellor Holden Thorp will speak, and the Clef Hangers, an a cappella group, will perform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students, professors and others plan to meet today to commemorate the life of Carson, who was known for her high academic achievement and drive to help others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The university has posted a biography of Carson at www.unc.edu/eve/bio.html.</p>

Its likely the same academics who now lament the horrible death of this young White woman also promoted school &#8220;diversity&#8221; programs intended to overcome her natural fear of and prejudice towards &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Yes, this is tragic, but according to black leaders probably not near as bad as the travesty on that black (exotic dancer) at &#8220;Duke University&#8221; 3 years ago, she is scarred for life because nobody liked her.</p>

			<p>There is not one word in this Eve Carson bio about her black murderer.  And I bet there won&rsquo;t be a peep about this at her official memorial.  There wouldn&rsquo;t be from PC liberal race pandering academia anyway.  The beat goes on.</p>

			<p>White women raped and killed daily by black thugs? The media yawns.</p>
<p>Tawana Brawley and Crystal Mangum make up stories about being gang raped by white men? Front page headlines followed by massive protest marches.</p>

			<p>Yes, this is tragic, but according to black leaders probably not near as bad as the travesty on that black (exotic dancer) at &ldquo;Duke University&rdquo; 3 years ago, she is scarred for life because nobody liked her. <br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  - </p>
<p>I have always thought that the main reason the dancer/hooker cried rape was because the guys at the frat party were dissatisfied with what was sent. None of them requested a black woman, but they got two of them. One of whom was very loaded, which led many of the guys to complain that their money was wasted. Blacks today, are often outraged when another race rejects them. It kills their theory about the entire world desiring them, and having a fetish for them.</p>

			<p>Question Diversity is right. The cowards that inhabit the halls of higher learning are despicable. No one is suggesting they prostelyize on race issues, but a mention of who the killers were would be appropriate, if only to round out the horror of the crime in the minds of the readers.</p>

			<p>What a shame for that poor girl.  I guess it&rsquo;s better to be dead than be a &#8220;racist&#8221;, right?</p>

			<p>Ronald above is right. Every single faculty member at this memorial will go right back into the classroom and try to convince their young white female students that black males present no danger and, in fact, their company should be sought out. </p>

How do these murders get reported these days?</p>
<p>Generally they&rsquo;re described as &#8220;senseless murders&#8221; with the victim being &#8220;in the wrong place at the wrong time&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, we know what that means. &#8220;Senseless murder&#8221; means the murderer was black. After all, no one has yet to make any sense out of the levels of black violence. &#8220;In the wrong place at the wrong time&#8221; means the victim was going about living her life but she got too close to a non-white.</p>

			<p>Eventually, when they run out of white women to murder, they&rsquo;ll start on the Asians - oh wait; they already have.</p>

			<p>Another case comes to mind. The rape/murder of Laura Dickinson in her dorm room at EMU, Ypsilanti, Michigan in 2006. For two months, the cowardly school officials covered up the facts and claimed she died from natural causes. Even witholding the truth from her own family.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2007/06/family_others_q.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2007/06/family_others_q.php</a></p>
<p>I live in the Detroit area so this should have been local news. It wasn&rsquo;t. I find it amazing when I mention this case to people i know, friends, family, co-workers alike, none have any knowledge of this tragedy.<br/>

			<p>It is quite possible had these girls been more racially aware and had a more realistic impression of blacks they would still be alive&hellip;just my opinion. </p>

			<p>I live 2 hours from Knoxville and our local newspaper and local news stations didn&rsquo;t carry even one story about the young white couple that were kidnapped, raped, tortured for 4 days and then murdered by 5 black thugs.  The authorities in Knoxville called it a carjacking.  Funny thing was the car was left behind and the victims wre transported in another vehicle to the murderers apartment where they were tortured.  The young man&rsquo;s body was found not far from the vehicle.  The girl was later found stuffed in a trash can outside the apartment.</p>
<p>Those who read American Renaissance know this story as &#8220;The Knoxville Horror.&#8221;  OUtside of AR, nobody knows the story.  This same story, if the races were reversed would be a prime time movie by now.  </p>
