<h1>Holder: Keep Voting Rights Act Restrictions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NewsMax, March 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. government must make a top priority of defending the Voting Rights Act, which guarantees the right of ethnic minorities to cast ballots, Attorney General Eric Holder said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is reviewing a ruling that upholds a provision of the act under which 16 states and some counties, mainly in the South, are prevented from making changes to their voting laws without federal approval.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs challenging a renewal of the act say times have changed since the 1960s, blacks are no longer excluded from voting and the act amounts to unwarranted interference in state affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must commit ourselves to continue to defend the Voting Rights Act that is under attack,&#8221; Holder said, arguing that the task is just as important as reviving the U.S. economy and fighting foreign wars.</p>
<p>Passed in 1965, the act outlawed literacy and character tests and property requirements to determine whether a person was eligible to vote. Southern states had used the requirements to keep blacks from the polls.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it sort of common sense to want your voters to be able to read?</p>
<p>Also, I thought it was unconstitutional for the Federal government to treat one state any differently than another.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea. Maybe blacks should concentrate on building their own majority communities instead of seeking integration. Then they could easily elected their own representative without have to mutilate the law and common sense.</p>

			<p> To Eric Holder and others of like mind, nothing has changed since 1965, and Southern Whites are never, ever, to be trusted. This is yet another example of blacks taking advantage of all the artificial advantages they have been handed by U.S. law in the last 45 or 50 years, then turning right around and insisting, &#8220;We come a long way, but we still got a long way to go.&#8221;</p>
<p> By all means, let&rsquo;s repeal the Voting Rights Act   &mdash;   and affirmative action, another idea whose time has come and gone   &mdash;   before they do any more damage to our society.</p>

			<p>What a travesty!  Any civilized nation ought have literacy, character, and property requirements for voting.  Illiterate bums, drunkards, and scoundrels who are not provident enough to buy a half acre to put a trailer on have no business deciding how a community or nation should be run.  I know that some posters will be objecting because they are law-abiding and productive, and yet can&rsquo;t afford a house.  But if we had not let the unfit vote, the worthy would not be so heavily taxed to support the unworthy.  Our country would not be so crowded and property would not be so expensive.  Vast swaths of our cities would not be ghettos and barios, where tens of millions of once well kept houses now unavailable to anyone who wants to live decently.  If politicians answered to no one but property owners, more Whites would be property owners.</p>

			<p>In this day and age, there is no reason for this act to not be made permanent. Peoples right to participate in elections will never be taken away.</p>
<p>It seems to me the only reason they keep this voting rights act in place is so that when it comes up for renewal, politicians can make a big deal of preserving these rights. They can then claim to have upheld the rights of those less fortunate.</p>
<p>Sad to say, many shouldn&rsquo;t have the right. Parasites will always vote in their own favor. </p>

			<p>It seems to me that a country that has universal suffrage with little or no restrictions or conditions,(except for age and criminal convictions) with no requirements  or social duties or involvement is certainly a recipe for national suicide. Unrestrained multiplication of the unintelligent, ignorant, parasitic and non producing populations will, with absolute certainty destroy civilization. To give these very same asocial, crime prone peoples universal suffrage is the height of collective insanity.</p>

			<p>Hey, Mr. Holder and President Obama are simply using this issue to allow illegal aliens to vote for Democrats. For all of the ambitious plans President Obama has for America, stopping illegal immigration, and therefore also stopping wage and job depression, aren&rsquo;t among them. For that matter, fixing the environment must not be among his plans either, because millions of people added to the U.S. both legally and illegally cannot help the environment in any way. <br>

			<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>During the 60&rsquo;s when southern states were forced to drop their sensible literacy tests the liberals in my home state of NY overturned the laws mandating English-only ballots for the very same reason: they were &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This is just plain insane. Historically, every functioning democracy restricted the right to vote to free male landowners. In the prototype, Athens, this amounted to just under 10% of the population.<br>
Now, a good 30% of urban blacks enjoy de facto immunity from the death penalty because they are too plain dumb to be executed. 80% of the black workforce (16-64) are either in Club Fed, on welfare or on affirmative action. Yet, you MUST NOT take away their &#8220;voting rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once you allow the dregs to vote themselves money, you end up with something like Hussein. Or Holder, yes.</p>

			<p>The right to vote is NOT of the kind &#8220;the more the better&#8221;. Since the election is a contest, it&rsquo;s a zero-sum game. My win is my opponent loss, and vice versa. </p>
<p>So, favoring one class of voters amounts to (partial) disenfranchising all others. And Mr. Holder &#8220;The Brave&#8221; is pushing just for that.<br>

			<p>The Voting Rights Act is the same as the minimum wage law.  It is a tool to hammer your opponents with.  By having it come up for frequent renewal, you get to dredge up all the wedge issues with which to rally your constituencies and maintain your hold on power.  Liberal whites appear to be either too stupid to realize this or cynically immoral. Take your pick.</p>

<p>In fact, the old voting requirements barred anyone of any race in poverty, illiterate or of criminal character. Hugely disporportionate numbers of blacks simply fit these descriptors, and still do, but those who didn&rsquo;t could vote. What changed most fundamentally in the Sixties was that our rulers decided the negative characteristics of blacks were the fault of whites. We have turned our blind eyes to the truth ever since.</p>

			<p>Citizens, especially retirees can help get out the vote in their neighborhoods, notifying their neighbors that they are willing to drive them to the polls on election day.  They can pass out their phone numbers to the neighbors and then call them up a day before the elections.  You don&rsquo;t need an organized political party to do everything.  We need to look for lots of little things like this that we can do to improve our communities. I used to believe that everyone voted especially during the big elections, but many Americans are apathetic and need to be coaxed.  Notice how the Democrats move heaven and earth to get all of their target voters to the polls.  Look at how ACORN opperates.  The Democrats fight for every vote, the Republicans seem to be more blase about it.</p>

<p>I slightly disagree.  They need better choices, and to believe (or, even better, to know for sure) that they have a dog in the fight.  Raw turnout for the 2008 Presidential election wasn&rsquo;t too much higher than that for 2004, the difference was that so many more blacks came out for the obvious reasons, some more Hispanics, while a lot of whites stayed home.</p>

			<p>From the little time that Holder has held that office, he has used it to advance his personal views.  Is it not a public office for the good of all US citizens?  The blacks generally have a strong tendency to only complain and squeal about how they have been oppressed and deprived by the white man even by this individual.  I smell a hidden agenda here.  Perhaps the never ending demand for reparations (more free hand outs)?   </p>

Unrestrained multiplication of the unintelligent, ignorant, parasitic and non producing populations will, with absolute certainty destroy civilization. </p>
<p>What this amounts to is a civilization requiring none of the original virtues that enabled it to develop and prosper to be able to participate in the decision making process that will determine the civilization&rsquo;s future. A civilization is a pocket of the human population that applies a set of goals, standards, and morals that allow it at some point in time to rise above the directionless base situation of human existence. The moment this happens a fundamental struggle is created between the population of the civilization, seeking to nurture the improved state of being enabled by increased order, and the random chaos of the rest of humanity that inexorably acts to destroy that order.</p>
<p> Civilizations are fragile in their beginning because there is momentum that favors reversion back to the original unorganized, bleak condition. However, if they succeed in surviving their infancy, the momentum turns to favor an ever-increasing level of sophistication, quality of life, knowledge, and power relative to the less organized components of humanity. The modern civilization is modern and good precisely because of the prowess and drive of the people who created it and continue to nurture it. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the tide is turning against the great civilizations responsible for most of the progress in this world because of a noble feature of advanced civilization that ironically invites its suicide. That feature is a collection of ethics that demands that all individuals deserve the happiness and personal security made possible by the long climb out of the dark depths of chaos. These beliefs are necessary and are the fabric that holds a society together; however they must be constantly reconciled with practical realities. Blind application of these beliefs causes us to compromise the very foundations of social responsibility, literacy, nobleness of character, and diligence, that made civilization possible and profitable in order to accommodate all people who want to benefit from the existence of civilization. These people in question are the ones out in the cold looking in at a drastically superior human state of being. </p>
<p>Advanced societies should strive to improve the overall quality of life for as many people as possible, but they should not lower the standards required to be a functional member in order to accommodate outside groups. Unfortunately, this is precisely what is happening to Western Civilization. A civilization either enforces strict requirements for assimilation, or it endorses capitulation. When standards are lowered, the quality and identity of the civilization are correspondingly eroded. Eventually, standards for functionality are lowered to the point where civilization has ceased to exist, and all of its members have returned to the womb of chaos that was humanity&rsquo;s primordial origin. </p>
<p>Remember: the only reason we are able to share these abstract thoughts across vast electronic networks in our nuanced language with our stomachs full and our health and security intact is because those who came before us did not capitulate. It is always easier to take than to build, and there will always be takers and builders. When there is nothing left to take then what? Look at Detroit for a microcosm of the larger process.<br>

			<p>   The South has been treated differently since it lost the war of southern independence. The north has always used the south for revenue and yet never distributed the wealth equally. Any president from the south since the &#8220;civil&#8221; war has been traitors that towed the line for their northern businessmen. Anybody that still believes that war was fought over slavery, is a damn fool. It was fought to let the people (northern and southern) know that freedom is what the government says it is, not what the constitution says it is. If you want to see hostile, don&rsquo;t pay your income tax once. The IRS, which is not a government agency, but is a private collection agency, will have you thrown in prison. And they will confiscate everything you own. That, my friends, is a hostile government that is bent on subjecting its people to slavery, ever last one of us. So just keep watching Monday night football and drinking your beer, while praising your favorite majority black football, basketball, etc. teams. </p>

			<p>If you assume that there is no connection between character and brains, I would say that no more than 25% of eligible voters ought be allowed to vote.  Half the population is less intelligent than average, and half the population has lower character, however that is measured, than average.  That means that 3/4 of the population is below average in either brains or character, or both.  Democracy leaves the fit and the worthy outnumbered, and so is the enemy of civilization.  </p>
