<h1>Quiet Muslim-Only Town in N.Y. Founded by Alleged Terrorist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Leventhal, FOX News, March 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you didn&rsquo;t know where to look, you&rsquo;d probably never find Islamberg, a private Muslim community in the woods of the western Catskills, 150 miles northwest of New York City.</p>
<p>The town, sitting on a quiet dirt road past a gate marked with No Trespassing signs, is home to an estimated 100 residents. There are small houses and other buildings visible from the outside, but it is what can&rsquo;t be seen from beyond the gate that has some watchers worried.</p>
<p>Islamberg was founded in 1980 by Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani, a Pakistani cleric who purchased a 70-acre plot and invited followers, mostly Muslim converts living in New York City, to settle there.</p>
<p>The town has its own mosque, grocery store and schoolhouse. It also reportedly has a firing range where residents take regular target practice. Gilani established similar rural enclaves across the country  &mdash;  at least six, including the Red House community in southern Virginia  &mdash;  though some believe there are dozens of them, all operating under the umbrella of the &#8220;Muslims of the Americas&#8221; group founded by Gilani.</p>
<p>Federal authorities say Gilani was also one of the founders of Jamaat al-Fuqra, a terrorist organization believed responsible for dozens of bombings and murders across the U.S. and abroad. The group was linked to the planning of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and 10 years earlier a member was arrested and later convicted for bombing a hotel in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gilani also denies any connection to Jamaat al-Fuqra, as do residents of the MOA compounds, who say the &#8220;terrorist&#8221; group doesn&rsquo;t exist and was created by enemies of Islam hoping to destroy their communities. Members also deny sending a portion of their earnings to the Sheikh, but a former resident told FOX News that 10 to 30 percent of their income is regularly delivered to Gilani in the form of cash donations.</p>
<p>FOX News attempted to visit Islamberg after earlier efforts to set up on-camera interviews were rebuffed. A spokesman said by phone that residents typically shy away from interviews since they worry their words will be manipulated and turned against them. He accused FOX News of misrepresenting the group and suggested covering an Islamic festival in Binghamton later in the month to celebrate the birthday of the prophet Muhammad. Then he hung up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another resident drove out, dressed in a cap and robe, video camera in hand, and moved so close to a female producer that he actually made contact. The resident kept his camera rolling for the next 15 minutes without saying a word, but he finally began to answer questions.</p>
<p>The man said residents get along with their neighbors and don&rsquo;t trust the media, which he said paints their town as a guarded compound &#8220;where no one can enter and exit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a village,&#8221; he insisted, &#8220;with people of all backgrounds, cultures and races.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force, still active in the reserves, who grew up in Brooklyn and converted to Islam while in the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got awards for &#8216;bridging the gap&rsquo; between American and Saudi soldiers,&#8221; he said, noting that he had helped process the bodies when 19 U.S. servicemen were killed in a 1996 terror attack in Saudi Arabia. He said there were many veterans in Islamberg, including one with a Purple Heart citation from Vietnam.</p>
<p>The man denied the existence of Jamat al-Fuqra, and at first denied giving a share of his earnings to Sheik Gilani, but he later admitted that &#8220;all churches have tithes.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the interview, two state police cars roared up, as one of the residents had called the cops, a common occurrence when reporters show up at the gate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>I have been thinking for years that there would be acutely organized efforts on the part of black thugs to ambush and snipe at white cops, in order to clear away impediments to the drug trade in big cities.  I&rsquo;m also thinking that these efforts will be AQ financed, and what AQ would get out of it is to distract American resources away from the Middle East and toward American inner cities.</p>
<p>If there is any place where black thugs could be getting sniper training to learn how to pick off white cops are at these Islambergs.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s way out there, and my theory probably has a couple of flaws, most notably that relying on black American thugs to disrupt the United States is insane because young black Americans (and blacks in general) have a notorious lack of patience and lack of ability to delay gratification, which are distinguishing characteristics of snipers (the Military uses mainly older (30+) white men as snipers because young men are too impetulent and impatient and testosterone-filled).  Then again, there were John Mohammed and Lee Boyd Malvo in 2002.</p>

<p>How strange.  We&rsquo;ve never EVER heard of this group described as a hate group by the SPLC.</p>
<p>If they were white, the SPLC would describe them as militia terrorists. <br>

<p>I find it hard to understand why a group can fly planes into buildings, yell and scream hate, and be elevated into the #1 victim group that trumps all other victim groups.</p>

			<p> Remember Ruby Ridge,Idaho 1992. Randy Weaver and his family thought they had the right to go off in the wilderness and live among other likeminded white people. They were certainly shown different.<br>
 The question then arises; If everyone is willing to accept other peoples right to live apart, why not whites?</p>

			<p>Would the Federal or any State Government allow white Christians to create a Jesusberg that only allows Christians, has a church and gun range?  If Whites tried this there would be another WACO, Texas massecure, don&rsquo;t you thing.</p>

<p>There are numerous &#8220;Jews-only&#8221; towns in this country, most notably those inhabitaed by the secretive and insular Hasidim. The Govt. takes a very hands-off approach to these far, far larger groups, no differently from this small Muslim enclave.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I approve of Islamberg, but unless the Govt. has evidence that &#8220;terrorists&#8221; are involved, what are they to do? </p>
<p>Now as others have noted, were this a Whites Only compound or the like, the Feds would swoop in in short order. This we already is a fact!</p>

<p>There are many Jews-only places in the US.  They may not be identified as such but to give a few examples: In NYC there is Borough Park, Williamsburg, Midwood, etc.  In New Jersey there is a town called Deal.  They&rsquo;re not identified as such and if a non-Jew were to attempt to move into these neighborhoods they might be forced out in subtle ways.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another interesting piece of information about muslims.  I live near Dearborn, Michigan.  If you don&rsquo;t know about this place, it is the LARGEST concentration of arabs outside the middle east.  I knew a lot of them really well and did not judge them for being different.  I was in high school when 9/11 happened, my brother at the time was going to college in U of M Dearborn.  All of the Dearborn locals(arabs) were laughing and cheering and celebrating when 9/11 happened.  My brother got into a lot of fights that day at school.  Arabs were running around attacking white students, even him.  He was fine that day, he&rsquo;s huge and loves to fight; a real white person that is proud and the liberals hate.  Anyways a day or two after that my brother was telling me how he couldn&rsquo;t get to school because Michigan Ave. (the main street in Dearborn) was closed off.  Why?  They were having a parade!!!  They all celebrated together.  Every now and then you&rsquo;ll hear about a crazy arab in Dearborn walking down the street with an AK 47 screaming jihad!  THESE are the things you don&rsquo;t see on the news, and never will.  Although a few AK 47 stories made it into local papers once or twice (try looking them up).  Since Dearborn is next to Detroit, my brother and I always debate who&rsquo;s worse.  He always says arabs; and since I went to college in Detroit I naturally say blacks.  At the end of every debate we both look at each other and say &#8220;We&rsquo;re both right.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Not being American, I can only go by what I read and hear but I understand there are many communities in USA founded by religeous groups or sects. Salt Lake City, Waco, Scientology, Hamish etc all spring to mind and there are others. However, these tend to be isolated away from urban areas in your vast land. However, in our small island, we in England have had huge swathes of our northern towns taken over by muslims. These towns were built by Christians, most about 150 years ago and are very English in character. However, muslims EXCLUDE others from entering and have government funded muslim police to enforce this. Muslims have not purchased land and built their own mini-pakistan with their own funds but live mainly on welfare. This is why we are so anti-islam and the British National Party stands alone in proposing an end to this islamification of England and a reduction of these aliens in our land. If they had settled and respected our country, our laws, our customs, way of life and our Queen, there would not be a huge problem but pakistanis go out of their way to shout, scream, riot and tell us at every opportunity that they are taking over our England and are determined to make everything muslim. The members of our Parliament that are muslim also take pride in their position and the power it gives them to promote islam. They have no interest whatsoever in representing residents in their constituency unless they are muslim, and they make no secret of this fact. If a White Christian MP does not put the muslims on his patch first and at the expense of others, he is shouted down and deemed racist. Well my friends, there is no such race as pakistani and that place has only existed since 1947, some 62 years, and has been a blight on the entire civilised world ever since. The cost to air travellers alone must run to billions and much human life has been lost. Now you know, so shoot me.</p>

<p>      Checked out your website, and the one thing that &#8220;struck&#8221; me while viewing the pictures of the black muslims and whites interacting, is that the whites seemed to be well bred, some even well educated. Where were the poor whites? This seems to be an ongoing theme; &#8220;the poor white&#8221; (unlike the poor black and hispanic,) being excluded and treated as an outcast in our society. Who respresents and supports them?</p>
<p>      Talk about discrimination.</p>

			<p>Maybe the rest of white America needs to take notes from the Mormons.  They have been successful at creating exclusive communities in Utah and throughout the US.  I have several friends who have been stationed in Utah and have a very difficult time getting jobs outside the gates.  I don&rsquo;t have a problem ith it.  I&rsquo;m even for it, as I wish to live in an only white Christian neighborhood.  I DO have a problem with providing the muslims a safe training camp to prepare further attacks.  Our leadership is so idiotic.       </p>

			<p>Question Diversity you are right about the shooting ability of blacks.  I&rsquo;ve taught firearms training for thirty years and it was rare to come across a black person who could really shoot well.  All the top shooters I have seen were white, whether it was the military, law enforcement or the private sector.  Military snipers are vitually all white as are the vast majority of police snipers.  Take a look at all the various shooting sports around the world from the Olympics, to the Bianchi Cup, to PPCT and everything in between, you will find whites dominating them.  My guess as to why blacks don&rsquo;t shoot well is that most of them don&rsquo;t have the skill, patience, self-control and discipline to really succeed at that level.</p>

<p>I agree with what you said, but the context in which I was saying is that one of the crucial elements in being a good sniper is patience, along with being a crack shot.  Good snipers know just as well when not to fire as they do when to fire, because firing too soon and at the wrong time is worse than not being there.  This is why the armed forces and police don&rsquo;t use young men, because young men have a lot of testosterone, and therefore impatience and impetulence.  Once you pass 30 (take it from me), the testosterone starts declining.  You&rsquo;re stronger than you&rsquo;ve ever been, and still in good physical shape if you have kept yourself up, but you&rsquo;re less excitable and more patient than you have ever been.  30-35 years old for a man is the sweet spot between physical vigor and life experience/patience.  Older than that and you&rsquo;re not able to do it physically, even though you have more experience.  That&rsquo;s why military and police snipers are of that age range.</p>

			<p>In response to the comments about Utah. Salt Lake City is pretty diverse religiously with about 40 percent Mormon. The rest of Utah is more like 60 percent or greater LDS but there are very few non-Whites outside of SLC. My husband and I are not LDS and have never had a problem getting a job. </p>

<p>Not let them here in the first place.</p>
<p>Cancel the visas/green cards of non-citizens and deport them.</p>
<p>I think naturalized citizens can theoretically lose their citizenship if convicted of a felony (of course this only happens to white immigrants).  Start enforcing this against Muslims.</p>
<p>If this was done, we&rsquo;d just be left with the law-abiding and those who were legally born here.  Still a problem, but a much much smaller problem.</p>

			<p>I worked near Islamberg. I spoke with someone who spent time there.  She told me they definitely are part of a terrorist organization based in Pakistan which beheaded Daniel Pearl. They send most of the money they earn to Gelani in Pakistan. They have 35 Islamberg type compounds across the country. I spoke with a local law enforcement officer. He told me they recruit blacks on parole or even on the lam. They protect the tives but constantly moving the fugutives between the 35 &#8220;towns&#8221;. In return, the fugutives commit crimes especially drug dealing and murder.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
But your assumption is that they are foreigners who can be deported or denied entry.   My impressions from the article is that many, at least, are converts   &mdash;    probably American blacks who were born right here.  So denying them green cards is meaningless.</p>
