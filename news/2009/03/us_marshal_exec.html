			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Sherwell, Telegraph (London), March 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The body of Deputy Marshal Vincent Bustamante was found with multiple gun wounds to the back of his head, according to Chihuahua state police.</p>
<p>The officer had been been the subject of an arrest warrant accusing him of criminal theft of US government property, CNN reported. The network was told by a federal law enforcement source that the marshal had been stealing the property and then pawning it.</p>
<p>His alleged activities came to light after a pawnshop owner became suspicious when Mr Bustamente attempted to pawn a shotgun. He was put on &#8220;modified status&#8221; duty during the investigation, meaning he had been required to turn in his gun and badge outside of his official work hours.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear why he had been in Juarez or whether his killing was linked to his alleged criminal activity.</p>
<p>More than 6,000 people were killed last year in drug violence in Mexico as rival narcotics cartels battled with each other and with the thousands of federal troops deployed by President Felipe Calderon. The worst violence was concentrated on key smuggling transit cities along the US border.</p>
<p>The news of Marshal Bustamente&rsquo;s murder came on the same day that Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, watched police storm an airplane in a mock hostage rescue at the end of a two-day visit to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mrs Clinton has discussed the &#8220;intolerable&#8221; drugs violence during her visit. But she also said that the demand for drugs from the US and weapons smuggled south across the border were a major contribution to the bloody mayhem.<br>

			<p>I &#8220;bet&rsquo; the Chilhuahua Police found him. More like they did it from my experience with Mexican government agencies. Too bad Klinton did not get the same treatment while she was there back stabbing the United States.  This is just another ploy to have additional reasons for gun control and more Federal US gov agencies  &mdash;  - like the Special Security Force directed by Resident Obama.</p>

			<p>This evening on Greta of FOX, a rep of ATF was citing the types of weapons being smuggled into Mexico FROM the U.S. he cited AK-47s, 5.7mm weapons which I believe are AK-74s and other weapons pictured to lend veracity to his statements were also Russian in origin. (THEY) will be coming for our weapons soon.</p>

Russian, or chinese?; remember, it is the intent of communist china to destabilize its most dangerous potential foe to its agenda: I&rsquo;ve also heard that there are many FULLY AUTOMATIC weapons involved in the drug wars; those would NOT have come from the US civilian market.</p>

			<p>THEY will use this as an excuse to TRY and take OUR weapons.  What WE need to do is DEMAND a CLOSED BORDER so that NOTHING can get across, either way!!!  Once again, criminal behavior punishes the law-abiding citizen instead of the criminal themselves.   Remeber the two border guards who were put in prison for shooting a drug smuggler?  Sounds to me like the government is in on the take and obviously made the guards an example so that the other guards will look the other way.</p>
<p>Criminals who use illegal drugs are responsible for all this mayhem.  I would like to see someone pepper the dope with poison and see who drops.  It would be interesting to see WHO EXACTLY in high places has been using this stuff and it would eliminate alot of garbage in our society.  </p>

<p>All true, who can actually say where the weapons really come from but the fact is that wherever they come from, those sources do not have the best interests of the U.S. in mind. And YES! there are MANY. MANY fully automatic weapons south of the border, I know this to be true.</p>

			<p>Carolinayankee, I don&rsquo;t know how many high ups are using coke. I do know US troops are in Afghanistan protecting the poppy fields because the Taliban had been burning them to destroy the influence and sale of drugs. They will be trying to use the collapse of Mexico as an excuse to take away our guns. </p>

			<p>An attempt by the government to disarm the colonials was the catalyst that sparked our first revolution.  If Washington attempts to repeat history then so will America&rsquo;s patriots and the politicians and bureaucrats will pay the ultimate price for their folly&hellip; </p>

			<p>I wonder what a U.S. Marshall was doing in Mexico anyway, they have no authority there, HELL!! nobody has authority there except the drug cartels. Anyone know how much the cartels are paying former soldiers yet?</p>
