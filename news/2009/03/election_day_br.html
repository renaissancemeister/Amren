<h1>Election Day Brought Conservative Victory Against Racial Preference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon Browne and Roger Clegg, Human Events, March 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As it turned out, on the same day that Senator Obama was being elected President Obama, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took a giant step toward providing equal opportunity, and away from guaranteeing equal results, by striking down an affirmative action program that was enacted by Congress and that mandated racial preferences in government contracting. The Justice Department did not seek Supreme Court review in the case, Rothe Development Corp. v. United States Department of Defense, and so the decision stands  &mdash;  a valuable legal precedent in the continuing struggle against racial preferences.</p>
<p>The program struck down in Rothe was mandated by Congress and required the U.S. Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, the Air Force, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to ensure that five percent of all contract dollars be awarded to individuals or businesses designated as &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221;  &mdash;  and it declared that blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans were automatically to be presumed to be disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Of course, if the government gives a preference to some, it will be discriminating against others. Rothe Development Corporation, a San Antonio firm owned by a white woman, was the low bidder on a contract to maintain the computer system at Columbus Air Force base in Mississippi. Instead of awarding Rothe the contract on the basis of her low bid, the government chose a minority (South Korean) contractor  &mdash;  costing the taxpayers over $150,000 more for the same service, by the way. Rothe sued.</p>
<p>After ten years of repeated appeals, on Election Day 2008, the Federal Circuit struck down the program, finding that Congress did not have sufficient evidence to justify such racial preferences.</p>
<p>While the Rothe case challenged a Defense Department program, the court of appeals&rsquo; decision is much broader. David Barton, Rothe&rsquo;s lawyer, points out that the Justice Department itself has acknowledged that the statistical studies Congress used to justify the military&rsquo;s contracting program are the same ones used by the Small Business Administration for its 8(a) programs and by the U.S. Department of Transportation for its federal highway work. Another contractor could try bringing a challenge to these programs, and they would likely be struck down. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the Bush administration, the U.S. Department of Justice conceded to the Supreme Court that a federal contracting program &#8220;may use race-conscious remedies only as a last resort&#8221; and &#8220;where the effects of discrimination are stubborn, persistent, and incapable of eradication through race-neutral measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Justice Roberts was right when he wrote a couple of years ago, &#8220;The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&#8221; The government can be vigilant against contract discrimination, can require the wide publication of bidding opportunities, and can ensure that the whole contracting process is transparent and open. That is the best way to end contracting discrimination  &mdash;  not by more discrimination against a new set of victims.</p>
<p>Finally, even if there could still, in theory, be a few cases of discrimination that go unremedied in the absence of racial classifications, there will be many more cases of discrimination that will result from the institutionalization of racial preferences. </p>
<p>So there you have it: Contracting programs that discriminate on the basis of race and ethnicity are divisive, unfair, costly to taxpayers  &mdash;  and now, thanks to the Rothe decision, clearly illegal as well.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time, but I&rsquo;d like to know how much extra money this disgusting program cost the taxpayers during the ten years it was outrageously allowed to continue violating low-bid contractors&rsquo; right to equal protection under the law.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action programs were supposed to benefit black Americans-not Asians of Mexicans. The fact that non-whites from around the world can be included in our affirmative action programs shows that there is very little &#8220;white privilege&#8221; left in America.<br>

		<p>I happened to talk to a black male, a retired teacher, on this topic. Below is our conversation.</p>
<p>I. Isn&rsquo;t it disgusting to take business from the lower bidder because he is white and give it to a much higher bidder just because he is black, is it?</p>
<p>B. But the black is from the disadvantaged  minority. Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to give them a brake, would you? Honestly.</p>
<p>I. Honestly? No, I wouldn&rsquo;t. It is unfair. You like it? Hire your disadvantaged  minority and pay them your own money, but case involves my money and I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>B. But Congress has voted  in favor of such actions.</p>
<p>I. My answer is the same. I would agree, still with some proviso,  to that process if the difference would be picked up by the Congress members who voted for the deal and paid out of their salaries. </p>
<p>B. But don&rsquo;t you know that millions of Americans support the law?</p>
<p>I. It&rsquo;s beautiful. So let those with bleeding hearts voluntarily snap their income to the deal and all the money on top of the lowest bid in every such case around the country pay out of their pockets. Let them be happy and me suffer in my indecency. Just don&rsquo;t take my money. I want to decide myself where and how I want it to be spent. </p>
<p>B. You are a racist.</p>
<p>I. Yes, I am. And I&rsquo;m proud of my race the same as you about yours. <br>

		<p>How comforting.  In between the 50 years or so of pervasive anti-white discrimination and  the indefinite future when whites will be a persecuted minority, there might be a few years when whites actually have equal rights.  The only meaningful battles are the demographic ones - and they are being fought in the womb.  No amount of favorable court rulings will guarantee whites equal opportunity if white women do not have babies with white men.  </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t stand affirmative action. It has made me feel like a second class citizen my entire working life.  I read a recent NIC study that calculated that this whole affirmative action/preference system costs us $1 TRILLION PER YEAR!  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a nice &#8220;STIMULUS&#8221; for our economy?</p>

		<p>and away from guaranteeing equal results, by striking down an affirmative action program that was enacted by Congress and that mandated racial preferences in government contracting. </p>
<p>If this was indeed struck down, it doesn&rsquo;t show in the number of &#8220;minorities&#8221; hired by defense contractors in, for instance, Iraq, Afghan and Kuwait.</p>

		<p>to alex, above, describing a conversation with a retired black teacher: Bravo!  &mdash;  well said. Of course, in my perfect world, one part of the dialog would be modified so:</p>
<p>&#8220;B. You are a racist.</p>
<p>I. Yes, I am, and you are a [expletive deleted], since you want to call names. Would you care to stop the name-calling right now?  I&rsquo;m proud of my race the same as you about yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for illustrating the language issue again  &mdash;  it bears repeating.</p>
