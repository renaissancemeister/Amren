<h1>Research Finds Segregation in Hospital Rates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Dial, Daily Iowan (University of Iowa), March 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent study released by two UI professors and a UI research scientist provides evidence for the existence of segregation and its potentially fatal effects.</p>
<p>The researchers found that in highly segregated communities, black Medicare patients are 35 percent more likely to go to high-mortality hospitals, said Mary Vaughan Sarrazin, an investigator in the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Medical Center.</p>
<p>In the study released March 3, she said researchers discovered black patients are also more likely than whites to be admitted to hospitals with high mortality, even when they live closer to lower-mortality hospitals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vaughan Sarrazin, along with Assistant Professor of sociology Mary Campbell and Professor of internal medicine Gary Rosenthal, compared hospitalization data from Medicare and looked at 118 markets for hospital services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although they mainly examined large markets with a minimum of 5,000 black Medicare enrollees, Campbell said the UI Hospitals and Clinics can learn some lessons from the study.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campbell emphasized the point that even after the civil-rights movement and the Supreme Court case Brown vs. the Board of Education, segregation still exists in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campbell also explained noted studies have shown blacks often wish they were not living in neighborhoods with as much segregation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people make the assumption that this is about choice, that people choose to live racially segregated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This isn&rsquo;t true. African Americans say they would rather live in more integrated communities.&#8221;</p>

			<p> Everyone pay attention now: Blacks have a higher mortality rate in hospitals than Whites because many of them don&rsquo;t live cheek-by-jowl with White people, and because doctors deliberately admit them to hospitals with a higher death rate. Everybody that believes that, stand on your head.</p>
<p> Aside from the fact that any &#8220;study&#8221; on racial matters done in the Groves of Academe should be treated with high skepticism, this news &#8220;story&#8221; in the Daily Iowan has to be one of the most nonsensical I&rsquo;ve ever read. How does the fact that we still have some residential segregation in this country have anything to do with mortality rates in hospitals? And why is it just assumed that segregation in housing is automatically a bad thing? And where is the proof that &#8220;African Americans say they would rather live in more integrated communities&#8221;? This whole thing smacks of a &#8220;study&#8221;, and a news story about it, that were set up to confirm assumptions already made by the &#8220;studiers&#8221; and the reporter.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Black patients more likely than whites to go to &ldquo;high mortality&rdquo; hospitals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, let me guess:  The way for the radical leftists to solve the problem would be to kill more whites at other hospitals to guarantee equality of outcome, right?</p>
<p>Incidentally, where&rsquo;s the Hispanic figures here?  I mean they outnumber blacks by about ten million.</p>

Although those of African decent are the fastest runners, how many blacks do you see jogging or in the health club? How many blacks do you know that adhere to the instruction and recommendation of their doctors? How many blacks do you know that eat &#8216;heart healthy&rsquo; or take an active role in controlling their Type II diabetes and blood pressure?</p>
<p>In the future, when blacks are admitted to low mortality hospitals, their mortality rates will remain the same and formally low morality hospitals will be labeled as racist.<br>

I would like to see a chart for hospitals:</p>
<p> On the X axis:  mortality rates.<br>
 On the Y axis:  percentage of minority employees.</p>
<p>I think a correlation pattern would be pretty visible.</p>
<p>And a Pulitzer Prize would go to the journalist who &hellip; ah, no, never mind.</p>

			<p>mortality rates are meaningless without morbidity (severity of<br>
illness) data.  An urban teaching hospital with a high level trauma service will have much higher mortality than a small rural county hospital.  Where would you go if you are really sick or injured?</p>

			<p>Hospitals in black areas are nothing more than alternative to welfare affirmative action all black and minority employee full employment programs for disfunctional blacks who are fit for nothing more than government work.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming us whites, blame the affirmative action physicians, nurses, technicians and even administrative and clerical personnel.</p>
<p>Our medical records department is about 98 percent black, most of them female.  We once found the papers from 23, yes twenty three different patients shoved into one patient&rsquo;s file.</p>
<p>Because the all black female medical records department has such a bad record of delivering surgery patient&rsquo;s records to the surgical floors in time for morning surgery, most of our surgeons go to the records room around 6/pm, find the records themselves and personally bring them up to the surgical floors for the next mornings surgery.</p>
<p>God forbid the mostly black records department should be expected to deliver the right records for surgery patients to the right place at the right time.  That would be racist and discriminatory.</p>
<p>Then there are the medical professionals from the most corrupt countries on earth.  Who knows where or how they obtained the credentials that enabled the hospital administration to hire them instead of competent white Americans who earned their credentials and licenses honestly.</p>
<p>Hospital employment is becoming just another government type job, no whites need apply.  And that&rsquo;s why the American health system will get worse and worse as white American Doctors and other health care professional providers retire and they are replaced by incompetent third worlders with dubious credentials.</p>

<p>Excellent point. I live in Los Angeles.  Hospitals in the western section of the city get very few gunshot, stabbing and beating victims.  Hospitals in the eastern (black and hispanic) parts of the city get most of the gunshot, stabbing and beating victims because that is where these injuries occur.<br>

			<p>Of course blacks would rather live in integrated communities.  They know their quality of life is much better living in a white area and sending their kids to a white school, then being back in a black neighborhood.</p>
