<h1>Border Violence Leads to Armor-Plated Vehicles</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Roberts, AP, March 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The drug violence in Mexico has gotten so bad that booming numbers of Mexican and American professionals are having their cars fitted with armor plates, bulletproof glass and James Bond-style gadgets such as electrified door handles and push-button smokescreens.</p>
<p>Until recently, it was mostly movie stars, business moguls and politicians who took such precautions. But now, industry officials say, the customers include factory owners, doctors, newspaper publishers and others who have business on both sides of the border and fear killings, kidnappings and carjackings by drug dealers or people in their debt.</p>
<p>The customers &#8220;don&rsquo;t have to be very big,&#8221; said Mark Burton, CEO of International Armoring Corp. of Ogden, Utah. &#8220;This becomes almost a necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The modifications typically cost $80,000 to $100,000, and they are being done not just on limousines, but on Toyotas, Hondas, pickup trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The war between Mexican authorities and the country&rsquo;s cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine cartels has killed 1,000 people so far this year. Last year, Juarez alone had more than 1,100 slayings. The cartels have killed police, military officers and civilians from Cancun to Tijuana as they battle for control of drug-trafficking corridors.</p>
<p>Customers get not only armor plating but tires that will run when flat and bulletproof glass, which bursts into a spider web pattern but won&rsquo;t break, even when shot with an AR-15 assault rifle, a weapon of choice among drug smugglers.</p>
<p>Other customers buy a package that will turn a Ford F-150 pickup or SUV into something out of a Batman movie: A button releases a cloud of white smoke for escaping a pursuing car. If the assailant makes it through that, the driver can release spikes to flatten the pursuer&rsquo;s tires. And finally, if the attacker makes it to the car, electrified door handles can give him a non-lethal jolt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Companies that install bulletproofing  &mdash;  or &#8220;blindaje&#8221; in Spanish  &mdash;  have been doing a booming business in Mexico, too. But some businessmen, like the Juarez factory owner, who lives in the United States, are convinced the armoring is better in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Texas Armoring, which started in the 1970s armoring limousines and other vehicles for world leaders, did about 100 cars last year and expects to complete 150 this year, Kimball [Trent Kimball, CEO of San Antonio-based Texas Armoring Corp.] said.<br>

			<p>We have hundreds of thousands of troops overseas and none on our border.  </p>
<p>Like almost all problems in our country, it has its first cause in government policy.  The drug war prevents no one from obtaining drugs.  It is a price support system for gangsters and a jobs program for law enforcement.  The drugs themselves would be worth pennies if legal.</p>
<p>Let the illegals in this country get high legally.  They&rsquo;ll be easier to find, collect, and deport.</p>

			<p>The phony drug war, the war for oil, and foreign nation building<br>
are grouped in to one road and that road stems from gangster<br>
syndicates in Washington.<br>

			<p>Yeah, I agree with above, spend too much money on that kind of thing.  I&rsquo;d like to see a Republican party that truly stands for personal freedoms.</p>

			<p>Maybe if the stupid Mexican officials had a &#8220;shoot on sight&#8221; order authorizing its military and police to literally shoot armed men on sight, the body count of the bad guys would rise, and the crime rate would fall. I understand it is illegal to own or carry weapons in Mexico, so any armed man is certainly not going to be a law-abiding citizen.</p>
<p>As an American, I cheer every time I read in our news, of another criminal killed by a police officer. For saving taxpayers the cost of a trial and subsequent imprisonment. For the fact one less criminal is out there, plying his trade.</p>

			<p>How about just legalizing the stuff (drugs) already?  It would stop funding the criminal infrastructure inside and outside this country.  It would allow for some semblance of control and regulation of currently illicit substances that are killing people who want to use them with HIV, uncontrolled drug quality and purity.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to stop this &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s not stopping people from using as evidence by dropping prices for drugs and the ever present consistent number of abusers.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going into severe economic times.  The last thing I want to see are drug rings coming out as government resources are withdrawn, armed to the teeth with military grade weapons bought by the drug trade.  It&rsquo;s time to call at least a truce if not a capitulation to people who are going to abuse drugs legal or not.  <br>
I&rsquo;d rather deal with addicts than these criminal enterprises which in Mexico and Columbias case morph into paramilitary interests fully funded by drugs and capable of challenging the state.  </p>

			<p>They should just legalize drugs. Where does it say in the constitution what I can or cannot ingest into my body? The self-defeating &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; is as futile as the &#8220;war on alcohol&#8221; prohibition era of the 1920&rsquo;s was. Prohibition was a gift from god to organized crime.</p>

			<p>I think there should be areas where drugs are legal. But legalizing all drugs without thinking things through is a terrible idea- think about it, that means drugs users would be free to walk around your neighborhood, live in your neighborhood, interact with your children, etc.</p>

			<p>To increase new car sales and save the auto industry, make some car models with armoring as a standard feature.</p>
