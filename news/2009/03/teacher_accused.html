<h1>Teacher, Accused of Killing Husband, on Verge of Being Fired</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry Pierson Curtis, Orlando Sentinel, March 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barring acquittal for murder, the career of one of Orange County Public Schools&rsquo; longest-serving teachers comes to an end this week.</p>
<p>After 40 years in the classroom, Delores Laster remains in the county jail since her arrest last week on charges of killing her husband 21 years ago.</p>
<p>She has one personal-leave day left before job-abandonment and termination proceedings begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could happen as early as the next School Board meeting April 14,&#8221; schools spokeswoman Shari Bobinski said Tuesday of firing Laster. &#8220;But we have to get all our ducks in a row.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school district fired Laster once before but had to rehire her, according to personnel records released Tuesday.</p>
<p>That happened after her 1994 arrest in Altamonte Springs on a charge of strong-arm robbery.</p>
<p>Already a veteran teacher, Laster was caught shoplifting toys and cosmetics at a Kmart store and attacked a security guard who tried to apprehend her, police records show.</p>
<p>As the criminal case went through court, school officials fired her in January 1995 partly because the violence and robbery charges demonstrated &#8220;her reduced effectiveness as a role model for students,&#8221; records state.</p>
<p>But months later, a handwritten note in the files by an unidentified school-district employee stated that another employee &#8220;advised me that she is under the impression that all charges have been dropped against Delores Laster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>Laster, now 61, pleaded no contest to attempted robbery and received a sentence of probation. But a judge withheld adjudication of guilt, opting not to declare her a convicted felon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the school district rehired her Oct. 10, 1995; she was not a convicted felon.</p>
<p>Placed on administrative probation for two years, Laster was transferred from Orlo Vista Elementary School, where she had taught fourth-graders for nine years.</p>
<p>She was assigned to teach first grade at Dillard Street Elementary School in Winter Garden, where she remained until her arrest last week, records show.</p>
<p>The Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has not disclosed its reasons for Laster&rsquo;s arrest in the 1988 shooting death of her husband, Clarence. At the time, the teacher told deputies that she found him dead in the garage of their Pine Hills home after returning from a trip to Gainesville.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Cpl. Duwana Pelton and Agent Tony Rodriguez of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement re-investigated the case as part of a new push to solve about 80 unsolved murders dating to the 1940s.</p>
<p>Orlando lawyer Thomas F. Egan, who handled Laster&rsquo;s 1995 case, has been retained for her murder defense. He could not be reached for comment.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But we have to get all our ducks in a row.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it that hard to fire someone sitting in jail for murder? I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s not so hard if it&rsquo;s a white guy. <br>

			<p>&#8220;She was no doubt hired to be a role model for black children.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scary part. She undoubtedly has been a role model, and has without question helped thugs, thieves and murderers &#8220;find themselves&#8221; and get started on the road of life.</p>
<p>Who doubts she&rsquo;ll use the racism accusation as her defense.</p>
<p>Who doubts she was the best the school district could do because those who hired her had to stick to the racial profile drawn by some poverty pest and a mob of urban types. She&rsquo;ll beat the rap, draw her pay and collect her pension.</p>

			<p>I was in middle school when our public schools were integrated.  The black teachers were, without exception, pitiful.  None of us had respect for any of them.  The English teachers could not spell and could barely read.  I had a math teacher who was arrested and convicted of statutory rape and assault with a deadly weapon.  School before integration was challenging and productive.  After integration, it was a joke.  Public school was a waste of time.  I have seen blacks do everything imaginable.  Everything except be productive citizens that could hold up to the standards of the rest of the world.  </p>

			<p>On the verge of being fired!!! the nerve of those people in the education system. Black, female, elderly AND a murderer!!! nothing will happen to her except quiet retirement. Don&rsquo;t hear much about Bernie Madoff now either, quiet retirement in the Witness Protection Program with Ken Lay, Ron Fastow, John Gotti and others.</p>

This is another case where the story that isn&rsquo;t reported is more interesting than the one that is, at least to me.</p>
<p>The unreported story is:  How did the police find new evidence in a murder case after <i>twenty years?</i></p>
<p>Congratulations to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for doing some thorough work.</p>

			<p>Another of the endless list of reasons to re-institute our salvational tool of &#8221; segregation of separate but equal &#8220;; blacks claim that they are &#8221; equal &#8220;, why do their actions or lack of,  betray their self-esteem mantra ?</p>

			<p>I saw my first murder on the 2nd floor of East High in Kansas City, Missouri. No blacks were involved but school wasn&rsquo;t integregated yet as I recall, I could be wrong though.</p>

			<p>The unreported story is: How did the police find new evidence in a murder case after twenty years?<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/crime/orl-asec-cold-case-031909,0,1287861.story</p>
<p>Kind of explains it all, it seems what happened is everybody pretty much knew she did it twenty years ago when the matter was originally investigated  &mdash;  they found blood all over the place in the master bedroom, there no evidence of a break in, no money stolen, she had a weak unconfirmed alibi etc. all pointing to the wife. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, it seems that she got off the hook since she was taking care of a large number of, presumably  black, foster children, including one who was mentally retarded. One of the foster children even was orphaned due to his mother being killed. My guess is that nobody wanted to be the &#8220;bad guy&#8221; and put all those kids back in foster care and traumatize them further. Also if the jury pool in that area was at all heavily black the woman would probably be virtually immune to prosecution, she is black, a school teacher, a caretaker of orphans  &mdash;  a conviction for murder one would seem difficult to obtain to say the least in a situation like the one here with no eye witness or murder weapon found. </p>
<p>Now with all her orphans gone, I guess they finally gathered the gumption to try to put her behind bars for a crime which was pretty obvious all along. To me her guilt is without any real doubt  &mdash;  she has that same soulless vacant stare exhibited by the typical 20 year old street thug murderer and she clearly is prone to psychotic episodes. I doubt they are actually able to nail her though after all this time though. </p>

			<p>Orlando has become a multi-cultural hell hole.  The city police chief and the Orange County sheriff are a black wife and husband team (god knows how that happened).  The other day someone stole the chief&rsquo;s 9mm Sig from a duffel bag she kept in back of her SUV (as it was parked in her driveway).  She tried to keep the story under wraps (wonder why?), but someone tipped off the local newspaper.  The paper, probably with angst since the editor is very liberal and wants to put the best light on blacks, had little choice but to run the story, therefore showing the chief for the buffoon she is.</p>

			<p>A vote for the Democratic party is a vote for all of this political correctness insanity.  I left that morally bankrupt party many years ago and I am never going back.  And don&rsquo;t fall for that &#8220;blue dog democrat&#8221; nonsense.  They all follow Pelosi and all the communist groups such as the feminists, black radical, envirnomental radicals etc. etc.  The &#8220;blue dogs&#8221;, supposedly moderate Democrats never challenge the far left liberals, they just go along to get along, they  are just more quiet about it than the flaming liberals like Pelosi and Kennedy.  If you vote for your Democrat from your Southern or Midwestern state, thinking that you are not getting the &#8220;bad&#8221; kind of Democrat, think again.  They have many crafty ways to fool the more conservative Democrat voters.  They are using you.</p>
