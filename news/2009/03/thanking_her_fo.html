			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corina Knoll, Los Angeles Times, March 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jane Elliott has blue eyes.</p>
<p>The years have turned her once-brown hair a bright snowy white, and at 75 years old she&rsquo;s rounder, maybe shorter, than she used to be. But eye color doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Elliott, an Iowa teacher, made deliberate use of that in 1968 when she created a now-famous exercise for her classroom of white third-graders. It was the day after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and she was struggling to explain the concept of racism.</p>
<p>She hit upon an idea: For an entire day, she conducted her class as if the brown-eyed children were superior to those with blue eyes. Elliott eventually made headlines, appeared on &#8220;The Tonight Show&#8221; and became the subject of multiple documentaries.</p>
<p>Three decades later, my high school sociology teacher played us snippets of a news program about the &#8220;Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes&#8221; exercise. For a 16-year-old Korean adoptee growing up in Iowa, the most fascinating aspect was this: Elliott had made history in Riceville, two hours from my hometown.</p>
<p>The daughter of white parents, I grew up in a predominantly white city, attended an overwhelmingly white school and interacted mostly with white friends. The subject of race in my community was hidden, buried under rhetoric that insisted we remain &#8220;colorblind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott was the first white person I ever heard who admitted to the privileges of whites, acknowledging that visible differences affect how the world perceives us. Her words sparked a hunger in me for more.</p>
<p>My first year in college, I took courses on race and ethnicity and Asian American history. Race, I learned, permeated everything, and it was OK to say so. I found myself with strong opinions and a circle of outspoken black and Asian friends with whom to share. The world felt bigger, and I felt empowered.</p>
<p>Much of my decision to move to Los Angeles eight years ago was to answer a longing to live somewhere diverse. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is late October, five days before the United States elects its first black president, and Elliott is in a dither. Her Iowa absentee ballot in favor of Barack Obama was mailed in weeks ago, although she worries about what he&rsquo;s up against.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is how Elliott has made a living. She retired from teaching 20 years ago and lectures a few times a month, primarily at colleges or companies in need of diversity training. She won&rsquo;t say how much she charges, but it&rsquo;s said to be about $7,000  &mdash;  higher if she&rsquo;s asked to conduct her famous exercise. {snip}</p>
<p>With King shot just the day before in Memphis, Elliott encouraged her third-graders to discuss how something so horrible could happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I finally said, &#8216;Do you kids have any idea how it feels to be something other than white in this country?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>The children shook their heads and said they wanted to learn, so Elliott set the rules. Blue-eyed children must use a cup to drink from the fountain. Blue-eyed children must leave late to lunch and to recess. Blue-eyed children were not to speak to brown-eyed children. Blue-eyed children were troublemakers and slow learners.</p>
<p>Within 15 minutes, Elliott says, she observed her brown-eyed students morph into youthful supremacists and blue-eyed children become uncertain and intimidated.</p>
<p>Brown-eyed children &#8220;became domineering and arrogant and judgmental and cool,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And smart! Smart! All of a sudden, disabled readers were reading. I thought, &#8216;This is not possible, this is my imagination.&rsquo; And I watched bright, blue-eyed kids become stupid and frightened and frustrated and angry and resentful and distrustful. It was absolutely the strangest thing I&rsquo;d ever experienced.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When they were saying and doing those things to one another, they were being their preachers, their parents, people on television  &mdash;  they were practicing what they had learned. I learned you don&rsquo;t have to have people of color in a community to have racism. My third-graders knew every negative stereotype they&rsquo;d ever heard about blacks, and there were no blacks in Riceville, Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott is an enigma to me, not only because she is a white woman who believes God is black and detests phrases like &#8220;reverse racism,&#8221; but because she comes from a city I know well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But as I grew older and more self-conscious, Riceville became yet another small town where it felt as though residents stared extra long at an Asian face.</p>
<p>(&#8220;Did you ever think it was because you&rsquo;re new in town?&#8221; a well-meaning aunt once chided after I expressed my frustration.)</p>
<p>Race was not something we discussed in my family. My adopted Korean brother and I were different, yes, but we focused on similarities. Besides, &#8220;Asian&#8221; was thought of merely in cultural terms, mentioned in connection to food or dress or dance, but forgotten in a black-white paradigm. Racism was acknowledged only when it appeared on the news, linked to such symbols as burning crosses or hooded Klansmen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elliott says her eyes began to open to issues of race and discrimination when she went to the University of Northern Iowa and met black students who were smarter and more talented than she was. Somebody&rsquo;s been lying to me, she thought.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After that appearance [on &#8220;The Tonight Show&#8221;], Elliott returned home to find that she and her family had been blacklisted.</p>
<p>Customers stopped patronizing the hotel her parents managed. Passersby called her names and shouted insults. The bowling team that she had long played for replaced her, and she was no longer invited to play bridge. Her children were spat on and knocked down, their belongings defaced.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Because of her experiment the white children thought to be inferior acted that way.  Funny, most blacks act the opposite.  They intimidate, are domineering, and are supremacists.  So her whole point is mute.</p>

<p>In other words she is a scam artist who makes her living peddling white guilt to people who are forced by their employers to attend her absurd sideshows, then she extorts an additional 7 grand for some puedo-scientific rubbish to further her point.  </p>
<p>I often wonder why people like this almost exclusively grow up in all white enviroments.  They look longingly at what in their minds are the exotic cultures of blacks and browns and blame any deficiency on white racism.  Those of us who are &#8220;fortunate&#8221; enough to grow up in racially diverse cities are less enthusastic about the vibrant and violent culture of blacks.      </p>

			<p>If Corina Knoll doesn&rsquo;t like living in a White country, she can change her name to Park or something and move back to Korea.  But, of course, the Koreans didn&rsquo;t want her.  They were willing to see an orphan shipped off to live among alien people, because no Korean wanted to adopt her.  Apparently, only Whites are so loving that they&rsquo;d take in a girl from the other side of the planet and make her their own.  Koreans wouldn&rsquo;t even take in a girl from down the block.  </p>

			<p>In 1968 one might be able to say that Blacks were victims.  There is no doubt that in the 40 years since it is Whites who have been the victims - Big Time - of Blacks and every other non-White group imaginable.  The strange part of this is that now that everything has been turned around onto us, these groups are not only still calling Whites the &#8216;Bad Guys&rsquo; but more so now than ever, while our people are discriminated against in the workplace, our children are being taught to value every culture imaginable except our own, they&rsquo;re being taught to dress, speak and act &#8220;Black&#8221;, our women are stolen and we&rsquo;re robbed, raped, murdered and otherwise being genocided by these people.  It&rsquo;s awfully ironic.  How much can we tolerate?</p>

			<p>I think Ms. Elliot has put one over on everyone. Wow talking about white enterprise, for all practical purposes Ms Elliot created the diversity industry all on the back of a dead Black man.  Sure it&rsquo;s betrayal, but at $7000 a pop she&rsquo;s grossing way more then Judas or Benedict Arnold did.</p>

			<p>I still insist that the very notion of &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; is one of the most remarkably stupid ideas ever foisted upon our people. Up until about 1960 America was still 90% White for heavens&rsquo; sake! Who else would be &#8220;privileged&#8221; in such a nation? Would anyone speak of &#8220;Yellow Privilege&#8221; in China or Japan? Of course not, as it would be so laughably asinine! </p>
<p>Whites need to stop apologizing for being successful, for being leaders, for being rulers, for being at the top of the human food-chain! Until we realize this, we will continue our slide into irrelevance!</p>

			<p>whites benefit not because of white privilege, but because of white work ethic, honesty, integrity, caring, devotion, intelligenc,compassion, and all of the inner qualities it takes to make a society work. and all of these things equate to a high standard of living, it is not privilege, we make our own privilege&hellip;</p>

			<p>This Elliott woman sounds insufferable. Even her own family can&rsquo;t stand her. Experiments like this accomplish nothing except make white children ashamed to be white. If she thinks God is black, let her move to Africa and get a taste of &#8220;heaven on Earth&#8221;. </p>

			<p>I thought the problem Martin Luther King was fixing was segregation? I thought being separated from whites was bad? Now we find out being too close to whites is bad. One thing is constant, whites are really bad people. Bad, bad, bad. We can&rsquo;t say enough bad things about them. We&rsquo;ve made it into a science. It&rsquo;s all part of our fight against hate.</p>

<p>Well Comrade Elliott, that is not so very hard to believe; I am sure that most toads and the lily pads that they sit on, are smarter and more talented than you are. I would assume that like most child abusers/molesters, you are quite: unstable, inadequate, pathetically abnormal, immature, and just plain repulsive. Why else would you delight in and seek fame (and fortune) through the terrorizing 8 and 9 year olds? </p>
<p>Moreover, why else would you seek to inflict the same torment on adults? I bet that really makes you feel &#8220;potent&#8221; and &#8220;special,&#8221; and at $7,500 a pop no less. </p>
<p>Below is a link to a YouTube video aptly titled, &#8220;Jane Elliot is Just Plain Nasty:&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y2UPNjRvB8" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y2UPNjRvB8</a></p>
<p>Notice how she really gets her jollies sticking it to a beautiful young white woman and reducing her to tears. Of course, the dehydrating old gorgon is doing it the name of &#8220;combating sexism,&#8221; but it really is about her fulfilling her sadistic and jealous impulses. </p>
<p>It is no wonder that she was ostracized by her community in the 60s, (gasp, how horrible to be kicked off the bowling team) as any normal society never wants to keep company with deranged perverts. It just goes to show you how degenerate the USA has become in the name of multicultural &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; that this Red abomination is now celebrated as a Hero of the Revolution.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all! </p>

			<p>Now for this Asiatic &#8220;American&#8221; and so-called author, Corina Knoll, who notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;My first year in college, I took courses on race and ethnicity and Asian American history. Race, I learned, permeated everything, and it was OK to say so. I found myself with strong opinions and a circle of outspoken black and Asian friends with whom to share. The world felt bigger, and I felt empowered.&#8221;</p>
<p>How &#8220;amazing&#8221; that you found Comrade Elliott so inspirational, as to actually go on to take &#8220;courses on race and ethnicity and Asian American history&#8221; in college. Moreover, how lucky to fall in with a band of &#8220;outspoken black and Asian friends with whom to share&#8221; in the fact that you and they (like Comrade Idiot) were so: incompetent, obsessive, and talentless, that these were the only classes that you could probably pass. </p>
<p>Did you get a double major in &#8220;race and ethnicity and Asian American history,&#8221; or was it only &#8220;race and ethnicity,&#8221; as the &#8220;Asian American history&#8221; got a bit too challenging at the 300 and 400 levels? Also, how many of those &#8220;outspoken&#8221; black male friends did you date, or for that matter even eat lunch and study with? Or, was it only whites and Asians for those ends of your social calendar?</p>
<p>Just how into casting off your &#8220;white privileges&#8221; by proxy were you, beyond taking Marxist hate whitey classes in college and pursuing affirmative action as a graduate?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>Just when you think the old bag is gone, she&rsquo;s back  &mdash;  as at the university where I work, where Elliot reappears from time to time like a recurring nightmare to torture a fresh crop of undergraduates. </p>
<p>I wonder how many university administrators (or members of the ruling class in general) have checked out articles like the one by historian Alan Charles Kors, in which Elliot is branded &#8220;unbearably tendentious and ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s ask her point blank: Has she ever had face to face dealings with the average black person? On second thought, make that a group (a gang, if you will) of blacks, since as individuals some can be pleasant and polite. I&rsquo;m guessing that there weren&rsquo;t a lot of blacks in Iowa in 1968, and if there were, they didn&rsquo;t act like the genetic garbage hanging around 74th and MacArthur Blvd. in Oakland.</p>

			<p>All of this over looks the fact that whites have privileges in white countries, blacks have privileges in black countries and yellows have privileges in yellow countries.  It is expected and quite normal.  </p>
<p>The experiment over looks the fact that much more than color is involved.  There are measurable and socially demonstrable differences that have profound effects on a society as well as national and racial well being.  </p>
<p>When these social and racial structures are upset the foundation for civil war is laid.  </p>

			<p>I once saw a breif filmclip of Jane Idiot, and it appeared to be one of those Whitey bashing sessions that I have read about many times, but I was never a victim of.She said that because we live in a majority white country, nothing bad can happen to us.(tell that to the victims of the Wichita Massacre, etc.)She was scolding them so badly, some of them were shedding tears! If I were a part of such a spectacle, she would be shedding the tears after I got through with what I would have to say.</p>

Obviously, you were not around then.  <br>
Well, I was, and I can tell you that blacks most certainly were NOT victims  in 1968.  Not 1958 either.  That&rsquo;s all rubbish!</p>

			<p>Corina Knoll spends most of her time writing anti-white articles for the Bolshevik rag known as the L.A. Times. A paper that is going down the drain because less and less people each week, meaning white people, want to read it. They might not be fully aware of the anti-white bias of the paper, but they feel it on some level. They&rsquo;ve simply stopped buying it. </p>
<p>Ms. Knoll has made a decent living for herself because of the ethnic spoils system in place. A system that benefits all non-whites. Her amateurish writing, despite the assistance of editors, shows that even the most sophomoric of non-white &#8220;writers&#8221; can be hired by a (formerly) major newspaper simply because of their ethnicity. In her case, it&rsquo;s a two-fer for the Times. Asian and a female. </p>

			<p>Jane Elliot was smart enough to see that she had a good chance to hop on the gravy train if she came up with a routine that would please the bolsheviks in charge. She did. She&rsquo;s as disingenuous as a human being can be. I&rsquo;ve never, ever, in 30 years of seeing this troll in the media, thought that she believed any of the garbage she spouts. </p>
