<h1>First African-American Comic Book Up for Auction</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, March 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The comic book that&rsquo;s billed as the first ever created by African-Americans for a black audience is up for auction.</p>
<p>A copy of All-Negro Comics No. 1, as it was called, is up for sale by comics entrepreneur Stephen Fishler. He says the comic is very rare  &mdash;  lasting one issue in 1947.</p>
<p>All-Negro Comics sold for 15 cents and was the brainchild of a black Philadelphia journalist, Orrin C. Evans.</p>
<p>The comic book, featuring such characters as detective Ace Harlem and Hep Chicks on Parade, is for sale as part of the online ComicConnect Event Auction. It began Feb. 27 and continues March 13, 14 and 15.</p>

			<p>It probably failed for the same reason most blak enterprises fail, it could not move beyond race, how many different ways can you describe &#8220;yt dun be keepin us down, unowutimsayen?&#8221; Once blaks leave the race arena the rest of what they have to say is either not very interesting or of poor quality. Blak &#8220;comedians&#8221; are good examples of this, how many times do we have to hear &#8220;evuh see a white dude dance&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Seems to me that the comic presents some stereotypical imagery that would be viciously panned if drawn today.</p>

			<p>One wonders why it only lasted for one issue  &mdash;  there must be a story behind this. </p>
<p>Did blacks object to the title even in 1947, or were blacks just as unlikely to be readers then as they are today?</p>

			<p>Haha that is hilarious.  Why are all of the blacks in stereotypical outfits?</p>
<p>Well, it is funny.  That&rsquo;s probably why.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure one reason it failed (aside from the obvious limited appeal) is that&rsquo;s fifty percent higher than other comic books of the time. I guess this isn&rsquo;t surprising, as it seems blacks are willing to pay more for the privilege of black items, ribs, rentals, haircuts, and anything else provided by blacks. </p>

			<p>This link gives a description of the entire comic, complete with pictures of many of the pages. For those who think rap and hip-hop are responsible for a recent decline of black youth, it should be viewed. </p>

			<p>From time to time, Marvel comics tried to introduce a black comic super-hero; the Black Panther, Luke Cage Power-man, Etc,,,none of then ever really took off. Maybe blacks just aren&rsquo;t inclined to read all that much.</p>

<p>Funny you should say that. Check out this article called &#8220;Integrating Gotham City&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3812/is_200105/ai_n8938117" rel="nofollow">https://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3812/is_200105/ai_n8938117</a></p>
<p>A black writer complained to DC Comics about the lack of black characters in Batman, so they gave him the green light to create one. The end result was Orpheus, a character so popular that they killed him off almost as quick as he came in.</p>

			<p>Not that I&rsquo;m making excuses for blacks, but there are several reasons this comic was doomed to failure.  First,  the black population was smaller in 1947 than today, thus fewer potential buyers.  In 1947 not many blacks could afford a 15 cent comic book. And lastly, the ever present problem of black illiteracy.  However, I remember as a small child looking at comics even before I could read, I just liked the pictures.  </p>
