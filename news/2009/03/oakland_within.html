<h1>Oakland: Within Local Community, Reaction to Saturday Killings Is Mixed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KPIX-TV (Oakland), March 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A steady stream of mourners came to Oakland police headquarters at 455 7th St. today to pay tribute to the slain officers. As of 3 p.m. there were more than 50 bouquets of flowers outside the headquarters and another 30 bouquets in the lobby.</p>
<p>There were notes attached to many of the bouquets and there also were stuffed animals and balloons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Oakland City Hall a few blocks away, at 3:15 p.m. 21 people stood in line to sign condolence books that will be given to family members of the four fallen officers. There also was a small collection of bouquets at City Hall.</p>
<p>A memorial consisting of flowers and five American flags has been set up on MacArthur Boulevard near where motorcycle Officer John Hege, 41, and Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, were shot by wanted parolee 26-year-old Lovelle Mixon during a traffic stop Saturday. Dunakin was killed and Hege was declared brain dead on Sunday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, around the corner on 74th Avenue, a very different memorial had been set up outside an apartment building where sergeants Ervin Romans, 43, and Daniel Sakai, 35, were fatally wounded in a shootout with Mixon, who also died.</p>
<p>That memorial was not for police; it was for Mixon.</p>
<p>Several people had stopped by to pay tribute to Mixon, including 48-year-old Sandra Cook.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Cook was there mostly for Mixon, she said, although she did not know him. She has a son about Mixon&rsquo;s age and spoke of Mixon almost maternally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something was going on in this man&rsquo;s life,&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>She took issue with the extreme amount of attention the officers&rsquo; deaths have garnered. Cook said her brother and nephew were shot and killed by San Francisco police in separate incidents. Another nephew was killed in a shooting in Oakland.</p>
<p>&#8220;When my nephew got killed, there wasn&rsquo;t any coverage of him,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Nearby, Bahari Olatunji from the International People&rsquo;s Democratic Uhuru Movement was handing out fliers for a march and vigil Wednesday in Mixon&rsquo;s honor. The flier states the vigil is meant to &#8220;uphold the resistance of the African community as represented by Brother Lovelle Mixon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olatunji said tensions between police and the black community are nothing new.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their history is one of brutality and terrorizing our community,&#8221; Olatunji said of police.</p>
<p>He said the community is still hurting from the shooting of Oscar Grant by BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle at the Fruitvale station on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Patricia Franklin, 59, said her daughter went to school with Mixon. She alleged that police are out of touch with the communities they serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t live in Oakland, they live in Concord, Brentwood, Antioch, then they come into Oakland and try to control it,&#8221; Franklin said.</p>
<p>Back across town, at police headquarters on Seventh Street, Chaz Walker and his wife Ifetayo Walker brought their two young sons to pay tribute to the fallen officers. They posed for a photo in front of the dozens of bouquets that had been placed outside the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted my sons to know that even though this is a black man that perpetrated this crime, we stand with the Oakland PD,&#8221; Chaz Walker said.</p>
<p>As a black man himself, Chaz Walker wanted to make clear to his sons that Mixon&rsquo;s actions are shameful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not about race, this is bigger than race,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Funds have been established in support of the families of the fallen officers and individual checks may be mailed to the Oakland Police Officers Association, attention Rennee Hassna, 555 Fifth St., Oakland, Ca, 94607. Checks can be made out to the following: Dunakin Children&rsquo;s Family Trust; Romans Children&rsquo;s Family Trust; and Sakai Family Trust.</p>
<p>Wire transfers may be made to directly to Merrill Lynch accounts: Dunakin Children&rsquo;s Family Trust, account No. 204-04065; Romans Children&rsquo;s Family Trust, account No. 204-04066; and Sakai Family Trust, account No. 204-04064.</p>

			<p>It looks as if many blacks are genuinely saddened by the worst  slaying of police officers in a single incident in state history.The supporters of the suspect are a very small number.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with victimizing Mixon in the same breath as the four cops he killed.  The reason is that it minimizes his role as a perpetrator.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this whole insanity of victimizing the perpetrators started with Columbine (almost 10 years ago now, tempus fugit)   &mdash;   in many official memorials, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were listed as shooting victims.</p>

<p>You could say the exact same thing about blacks in general.</p>

<p>Blacks are incapable of co-existing with other cultures.  They need to be segregated.  Let them have their own police force, government and communities.  In exchange, don&rsquo;t expect any handouts from whitey in ANY FORM.  Given their propensity to criminal and psychotic behavior, their &#8220;communities&#8221; would self destruct in no time. Look at the Zimbabwe formerly known as Detroit, as an example.</p>

<p>Too bad they&rsquo;re too cowardly to do more than run their mouths.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m looking forward to their continued protests in order to highlight how effective electing a black president was to stemming unreasonable black behavior.</p>

			<p>As a young White man growing up in southern California I would go to punk rock concerts and remember being harassed and bullied by cops. One White kid was roughed up pretty bad. We were just teenagers proud of our race, we did not deserve the treatment we got. I have always looked at cops as individually pretty decent, but collectively they are upholding the governments political correctness. I am not saying that is what happened in this case in Oakland, but cops are not always on &#8220;our&#8221; side.</p>

			<p>So it&rsquo;s come to light that this Mixon is not only a multi-urderer of the people who protect us all, but a pedophilic rapist with the victim from his own neighbourhood (alleged on the second count).<br/>
 <br/>
At what point does the black community say &#8220;I can&rsquo;t defend this guy&#8221;, what more heinous crimes could you add to his rap sheet?<br/>
I&rsquo;m having trouble thinking of any that are worst?<br/>
Maybe cannibalism (raping your neighbours children could be described in that way).</p>
<p>I can understand his family feeling they have the duty to defend him to a point but not the community.<br/>
It&rsquo;s like defending Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy in my book.<br/>
It just shows how seperate that they see themselves as.<br/>
That killing four peace officers can somehow be seen as the actions of a victim. <br/>
This Mixon so casually, took so much from so many people.<br/>
He deserves his place in hell.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to say that you want, or intend to turn your life around, but where are the actions that prove this?<br/>
Carrying guns and raping children does not show any commitment to bettering yourself.<br/>
I find it bizarre that anyone who lives under the protection of the law can defend this guy in public. <br/>
It&rsquo;s actually disgusting. <br/>
People that take things for granted need to lose those things in order to learn to appreciate what they had.</p>

			<p>I would love to see the Oakland PD &#8220;de-Police&#8221; the neighborhood, and let them get what they so richly deserve, the chaos of having no order or social control. How long before the same &#8216;urhu peoples movement&rsquo; is complaining about not having any police around? May it be so!  </p>

			<p>Howard:</p>
<p>Cops pick on young men, no two ways about it.  Especially young white men, for the young don&rsquo;t vote and whites have no powerful racial lobby.</p>
<p>I had two different business law courses in college, and in the last several days of the second one, the Prof gave us some practical advice about the law.  One of her points to us, and by &#8220;us&#8221; I meant whites in the 19 to 23 age range, is that &#8220;you&rsquo;re not paranoid because the cops are out to get you, especially you gentlemen.  Police pick on young men, it&rsquo;s a fact of life.  Get used to it, and if you&rsquo;re detained by a cop, be on pluperfect behavior, and don&rsquo;t bloviate about the Constitution.  Just let him do his or her job, if you think there are any Constitutional concerns, there will be a time and place for that later.&#8221;  Since the class was all white, I could imply that she meant they pick on young white men.  Young black men have the NAACP to protect them.</p>

<p>Maye that&rsquo;s when the practice started to get more formalized, but this mentality has existed since Rodney King and O.J. Simpson.</p>
<p>Any black (who gets caught) committing a crime these days is considered a victim.</p>

			<p>The same people who idolize creeps like Mixon for their &#8220;resistance&#8221; are unaware that this is exactly why we whites pay high real-estate prices and property taxes so we can live as far away from them as possible.<br/>

			<p>I agree with what Laurence Auster says on his site.  The police in Oakland are only supporting their own tormentors by continuing to try to maintain civilization.  Let the Africans live in the city they would create.</p>
<p>You just have to be prepared to deal harshly with the refugees.</p>

			<p>Blacks are largely an amoral people, at least insofar as we(Whites)understand and present morality. Although there are obviously exceptions, by and large, they simply DO NOT see the world as we do, they do not view civilization as we do. Indeed, to them civilization is oppressive and negative - to us it the only sensible way of life. Multiracial societies are doomed from the start. The sooner we all admit it, tht sooner the violence and ugliness can stop. </p>

			<p>Even if Mixon had raped and murdered a newborn baby, the black community would see him as just another noble black victim.  Their anger would be towards the family of the infant. </p>
<p>Black people love a black criminal more than they could love any white person.</p>

			<p>It seems that most blacks are incapable of thinking in terms of proportionaity.  Have you ever noticed that many blacks will justify the grossest forms of violence due to any slight   &mdash;   real or imagined?  A lot of them will take a life or limb because of a perceived insult.  This is just another example.  They be perceiving that the police are oppressing.  So, naturally, in the eyes of many in this &#8220;community,&#8221; it&rsquo;s totally acceptable   &mdash;   indeed, laudable   &mdash;  to murder four of them.  And then set up a shrine to the fallen hero.  </p>

			<p>Wow, I don&rsquo;t know what to say to posters like Howard, Rudy, and the others. </p>
<p>Although I work in a large metropolitan city, one that&rsquo;s mainly black, I do have contact with young white men. However, those contacts are kept quite short by the enormous burden placed upon my agency by the black neighborhoods. Most shifts are spent running call to call in horrible ghetto neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Are there uprofessional, ego-boosted police officers? Absolutely. Without a doubt, the job can draw some of the most unstable people imaginable. The raw power, in the hands of an unfit individual, is easily abused. </p>
<p>However, I can only ask, in the interest of objectivity, that you realize that just as one unprofessional police officer ruins it for the rest of us, so too does one out-of-line young man. </p>
<p>For instance, when the local downtown nightclubs close at 2 a.m. and I ask a young man to move on with his friends and head home, I don&rsquo;t need a slurred, cross-eyed, beer-breath soliloquy on the finer points of constitutional law. Just move on please&hellip;besides, any cop that&rsquo;s a true professional shouldn&rsquo;t ask a citizen to do something that the officer can&rsquo;t ultimately force them to do legally if it comes down to it.  </p>
<p>For me, the job is never personal. I still say &#8220;Please&#8221; and &#8220;Thank you&#8221; when I deal with citizens, even the drunk 20-year old who&rsquo;s had a bit too much &#8220;liquid personality.&#8221; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lump every cop into the same heap. The unprofessional ones don&rsquo;t speak for the rest of us. </p>

			<p>blame all of this new boldness on your white neighbor that had  the obama sign in his front yard before the election. this is directly caused by the 40 million white voters who elected obama. the rest of us knew this kind of stuff would happen after the election. i say show absolute blatant disrespect and contempt to your obama voting neighbor..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the &#8216;publishing industry&rsquo; was able to wrap up a &#8216;book&rsquo; about the incident so fast. That&rsquo;s as fast as the &#8216;Uhuru&rsquo; movements arrival.</p>

			<p>Here in Southern California, it seems that most of the time people who claim to have had the police &#8220;pick on them&#8221; are actually people who are angry that the police didn&rsquo;t let them do whatever they bloody well felt like, wether it was disturbing the peace, driving drunk or failing to clear an area. The problem with the US in general is that the people who have warped our society have made people of all races more self centered when it comes to believing that they should be allowed to do whatever they please. At the far end of the scale it seems to be blacks, most non-whites, and huge chunks of snobby whites from places like Beverly Hills, Encino, Sherman Oaks, etc who think they run everything. Next are young, middle class whites who will a bit more aware of the way things are, still get a bit rambunctious or at least verbally combative with the police because they have been taught to be that way by the media and their teachers. It&rsquo;s a bad situation all the way around as a lot of street cops aren&rsquo;t much older or are the same age as these young people. </p>

			<p>Rapist, is not so much of a stigma in black society, the president Zuma of South Africa views rape as a generous gift to the receipt of the unwanted loving and was able to convince a SA jury of the same.</p>
<p>I think the unspoken &#8220;logic&#8221; of the black nationalist mind is that murder and mayhem drive whitey out of &#8220;their&#8221; cities, thus crime and mayhem of any sort, even perhaps directed at other blacks, constitutes &#8220;resistance&#8221; since it leads to chaos and societal breakdown. </p>
<p>With enough carnage they know whites will simply pick up and leave altogether a la Detroit, and thus they will have their 100 percent all black paradise. </p>

			<p>Some commenter&rsquo;s here have said &#8221; it&rsquo;s not about the perpetrators race &#8221; but the fact of the matter It Is. When time and time again blacks commit crimes at double or triple the rates of non blacks, It Is About Race.<br/>
They seem to have a very poor understanding of what civilization is all about as shown by the condition of EVERY city or village where they reside in any substantial numbers. I don&rsquo;t like saying this but blacks in many ways are like Spoiled Children, with 40 year old men walking around in Droopy Draws and Hats Tilted in the manner of a 12 year old. Most of their problems will Never Be Resolved, it&rsquo;s their Culture We Are Dealing With and they have little if any desire to change it?</p>

Well, of course!  They know that if they arrest or beat up a young white man, no enraged mob of white militants is going to march on police headquarters or threaten to burn down city hall.   With blacks, they don&rsquo;t want to mess around with that chance. The high officials are all afraid of them.   Blacks are highly vocal, violent, and stick up for their own.  (Whether right or wrong, I might add.)</p>

			<p>Ah, so now we know Lovelle Mixon:</p>
<p>1) Killed 4 policemen;<br/>
2) Probably killed at least one other person, but escaped prosecution due to lack of evidence;<br/>
3) Was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for his actions during an armed robbery;<br/>
4) Was a rapist;<br/>
5) Was a pedophile;</p>
<p>No, Mixon was definitely &#8220;not a monster,&#8221; he &#8220;just wasn&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>

To Howard:</p>
<p>As a white man, I&rsquo;ve had both good and bad experiences with the police.</p>
<p>On an individual level, one to one, they can be polite and friendly.</p>
<p>But when doing crowd control on any group, the police always act in an aggressive manner to try to quell trouble. They&rsquo;re always greatly outnumbered by people who can turn on them in a second. What you see as a night out with your friends, they see as a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt your experience but your experience is typical of the police (and security) in crowd control situations.</p>
<p>As a young guy having a good time with your friends, you didn&rsquo;t see any problem and you couldn&rsquo;t see the situation from their perspective.</p>
<p>Yes, cops can come off as jerks. I wasn&rsquo;t there and I don&rsquo;t know all the specifics and I don&rsquo;t doubt your story. The police can&rsquo;t know how any crowd is going to behave at any moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had similar experiences as an adult taking kids to large entertainment events. When the show is over, the security staff are rude jerks who rush to get people out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of their (bad) training at crowd control. Keep people moving and don&rsquo;t take any lip (or even polite small talk) from anyone, even adults with kids.</p>

			<p>Question Diversity,</p>
<p>You are dead on about this. I might also add that when they tried to ram through that monstrous &#8220;memorial&#8221; in Penn. where flight 93 crashed they included the names of the four hijackers among the &#8220;honored dead&#8221;. This isn&rsquo;t coming from the minorities, we all know how they feel. The fetish of victimization has been going on forever. I would say that the abolitionists of old have succeeded beyond even their wildest dreams. But I would guess that even John Brown would be appalled at the weak, instinctual appeasement of soft white liberals. It might be that only a anarchy inducing disaster could toughen us all up again. If that happens and we do all get on the same page there will no longer be debate about honoring Lovelle or Atta. Their increased numbers won&rsquo;t matter either, given our proven ability to realize great feats of every kind, once motivated and organized. </p>

<p>But it was not always so.  And a lot of this attitidue has to do with the nature of crowds these days.  Back in the 70s, in the predominantly white area I grew up in, you could go to an evening movie, and when you left the theatre there weren&rsquo;t police cruisers parked everywhere.  Now however, in the largely black area I live in, this is simply routine.  This is not just due to the racial element.  I think that young people were simply more polite back then, and cops did not see a potential riot in every gathering of young men.</p>

<p><i>Of course</i> they don&rsquo;t live there! When they live in the outlying cities, they get a break from the genetic garbage that are trying to murder them. </p>
<p>I have had to make it clear to a few of the neighbors, almost to the point of rudeness, that my house is NOT a police substation. I live in a neighborhood that is still pretty nice, but there are a few people with shady pasts down the street. I don&rsquo;t bother them, they don&rsquo;t bother me, and neither of us (er, &#8220;defecates&#8221;) where we eat. </p>
<p>And by the way, each of those cities mentioned has a significant and growing problem with criminals imported from Oakland.</p>

			<p>  I don&rsquo;t have problems with the police because I avoid situations that bring me in contact with them. I mind my own business, don&rsquo;t stay up all night, don&rsquo;t drive much over the speed limit, avoid large scale events, don&rsquo;t hang out late in bars or use illegal drugs. I get along fine with the boys in blue. <br/>

			<p>&#8220;I would love to see the Oakland PD &ldquo;de-Police&rdquo; the neighborhood, and let them get what they so richly deserve, the chaos of having no order or social control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the neighborhood would become a safe harbor for black criminal gangs that would inevitably foray out into White neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I think these four policemen were victims of PC departmental training which prohibits racial profiling and stresses the need during traffic stops to avoid intimidating appearances. During all close encounters with the public in high crime areas, a cop should keep the palm of a hand on the butt of his pistol and train regularly to shoot fast and for effect.</p>
<p>From the mug shot of Mixon it&rsquo;s easy to see that he was a cretinous psychopath.</p>

			<p>Most stupid whites  have never held a conversation with a black man who wasn`t wearing a uniform or holding a government job. The think that all blacks are like Dr. Huxtable, Barak Obama,Sidney Portier, or Joe Louis.<br/>
     I have represented young black men for 36 years. Yearly I watched them get meaner, more violent, more brutal towards their women, even mothers, and less educated.By age 12 they are 4 years behind their white counterparts. They believe they have no future except crime, death, or imprisonment. They have no respect for anybody or anything. They react only to blind power and immediate violence. They are a greater danger to us than Al Qeda and the North Koreans combined. Racial progress is a farce. <br/>

			<p>Police training as it has been traditionally performed cannot re-create the immediacy of the conditions faced by police officers when confronted by lethal threat: Here it is. Right now. Live or die. If you shoot, you will be scrutinized and second-guessed with an eye to punish, not train. If you don&rsquo;t shoot, the individual who shot you because you didn&rsquo;t act quickly and decisively enough will spit on you as you die.</p>

<p><i>Posted by S.L. Cain at 12:43 PM on March 26</i></p>
<p>I agree. Urban crowds today are different; less orderly and more inclined to cause trouble which is why police and security have taken a more aggressive and confrontational approach. It&rsquo;s difficult to say I approve of their approach but seeing how urban crowds behave today I understand their actions.</p>
<p>The shooting of the black man (Oscar Grant) by the white police officer is a good example of the dangers police and security now face with crowds.</p>
<p>Go to youtube and search for &#8220;BART Shooting&#8221; and watch the full length videos of how the crowds turned on the police. It&rsquo;s easy to see how the police can be driven to over react in a tense and explosive situation of an aggressive crowd taunting and harassing them.</p>
<p>The best thing to do in a crowd today is to move to the periphery as quickly as possible and away from any point where the crowd and the police meet. If the crowd turns, the police are going to react and people are going to get hurt.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve taken the kids to childrens&rsquo; events and after the show, the arena security turn very impolite. Their only concern is to clear the venue as quickly as possible and they don&rsquo;t care if you have kids with you. Being polite to them doesn&rsquo;t help. They have a single focus to get people out ASAP. It&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been trained and told to do (and they can be real SOBs in the process).</p>

			<p>Reply to Charles B. Tiffany,</p>
<p> I agree with your post with one qualification. The North Koreans are a &#8220;danger&#8221; to Americans ONLY because America CHOOSES TO KEEP TROOPS in South Korea 56 years after the Korean war ended. If America left the Korean peninsula North Korea would be no more dangerous to America then to Canada or Mexico.</p>

			<p><i>It seems that most blacks are incapable of thinking in terms of proportionaity. Have you ever noticed that many blacks will justify the grossest forms of violence due to any slight  &mdash;  real or imagined?</i></p>
<p>People in general do this, but yes blacks take the cake in my experience.  Maybe there&rsquo;s an IQ correlation.</p>
<p>E.g., a presumably white commenter in one of the articles about this story asserted that raping a 12 year old girl is just as bad as murdering 4 police officers.  Such nonsense!  Last time I checked, the 12 year old girl was still alive, and physically probably none the worse for wear.  She&rsquo;ll probably be largely over it in a few years, at least in terms of social functioning.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t come back from a pine box.  There is no (common) crime you can do to someone that exceeds murder.  Yet FOUR murders, policemen no less, are no worse than one rape?  This shows a total absence of a sense of proportionality IMO.  I&rsquo;d be ashamed to even pretend to believe something that grossly immoral.</p>

<p>Where did you get your figures?  Double or Triple?  Last time I checked, the black murder rate was EIGHT TIMES the white rate (confirmed by victim reports, BTW).  The black rape rate was SIX TIMES the white rate, again, last time I checked (no doubt poverty and white racism are to blame for the black rape epidemic).</p>

			<p>&#8220;Carrying guns and raping children does not show any commitment to bettering yourself. <br/>
I find it bizarre that anyone who lives under the protection of the law can defend this guy in public.&#8221; - GenX in Oz</p>
<p>In what way do you maintain that carrying guns and raping children are comparable? Is anything that is not about &#8220;bettering yourself&#8221; to be considered together with violent despicable sexual assualt?</p>
<p>Carrying weapons is about protecting yourself. Does this qualify as bettering yourself?   </p>
<p>Mixon is of course indefensible, but he is indefensible not because we live &#8220;under protection of the law&#8221;; we don&rsquo;t. If we lived under the protection of the law, crime would not be rampant as it is. The law and its agents are not protecting us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your comment is ill intentioned, and I agree with much of the rest of it. But the quoted portion is evidence of Big Brother&rsquo;s conditioning. Law enforcement officers are not keeping the streets safe, we all know this. What&rsquo;s more, the black community (and others) do have legitimate issues with the authority of LEO&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The only issues the blacks have with Law enforcement would go away if the blacks were law abiding citizens!! we all know the black &#8216;community&rsquo; will protect, aid and defend a black criminal even when the victim/s IS/are BLACK!! so naturally the blacks have &#8216;issues&rsquo; with law enforcement, they&rsquo;re usually the criminals.</p>

<p>You are right, my statement sounds very broad like I think <i>all</i> gun ownersghip is bad. Let me re-qualify my statement, Mixon was a parolee on conditional release from prison for commiting a violent crime that involved discharging a firearm.<br/>
His M.O. seemed to be &#8216;intimadation with a weapon&rsquo;.<br/>
And I meant <i>in his case</i> carrying a weapon showed a lack of change in his behaviour.<br/>
And in terms of cause and effect, if you&rsquo;ve been branded a violent criminal by society (&#8216;in his mind&rsquo; and via the court sysytem&hellip; as a result of your own actions of course),you have a racial chip on your shoulder, poor impulse control and high testerone. You could say it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen.<br/>
Fear the man who has nothing to lose.<br/>
And if you&rsquo;re going to walk around with lemons, sugar and water it&rsquo;s only going to be a matter of time before you make lemonade, or conversely if you you&rsquo;re trying to give up drinking you don&rsquo;t hang around bars and your drinking buddies.<br/>
As you no doubt know, if you blame all your problems on external factors, you can never change because all of your perceived problems are &#8216;out of your control&rsquo; and you will be the eternal victim.<br/>
And this guy couldn&rsquo;t say &#8220;I need to have a weapon for self defense because more neighbourhood is so rough&#8221; (again &#8220;poor me&#8221;  vicitm of circumstance). <br/>
For 1. You can&rsquo;t deficate in your own backyard, and then complain when you step out and get (proverbial) on your shoe.<br/>
And 2. Mixon didn&rsquo;t have a 9mm pistol to protect himself from being car jacked, he had a illegal, fully automatic industrialized, War level, killing machine i.e. AK47 (5.56mm) or Kalashnikov(7.62mm) that was powerful enough to shoot through a closet door and SWAT team members helmets with a rate of fire fast enough hit three fully trained SWAT team sergents, critically injured two of them of course (in that particular firefight).<br/>
This is where I think our &#8216;everyone is equal&rsquo; philosophy that permeates the Western world is floored, I don&rsquo;t think alcohol, pornography and firearms for instances are meant for everybody. I believe that if your people develope a technology you shouldn&rsquo;t necessaryily share it with everybody on the planet, a exaggerated example of this sort of techno shock would be giving nuclear technology to Papua New Guinea. You get my point.<br/>
So I don&rsquo;t believe the way to find peace is for <i>everyone</i> to be armed (OK Corral?), and I don&rsquo;t like the senario we have down here either where only the police and criminals are armed.<br/>
But I remember a news story a while back where a couple of our full contact, no neck,  football players were visiting L.A. and they were mugged by a who they described as a twelve year old black male with a handgun, and that idea scares me alot, that your life could end up in those immature hands. <br/>
I grew up reading &#8216;SOF magazine&rsquo; and &#8216;the shooters bible&rsquo;(among other things), I was on my high school shooting team and my father won a bronze medal for marksmanship as a navy cadet in England.<br/>
And if I was in the States I would certainly get a CCW permit.<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/6juxkk" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/6juxkk</a> &hellip;looking at this looks like the whole country is heading that way.<br/>
I hope this clears things up.</p>
