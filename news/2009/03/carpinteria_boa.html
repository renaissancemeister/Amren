<h1><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/03/carpinteria-boa.html">Carpinteria Board Votes to Retain Native American Images As Part of School Regalia</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Chawkins, Los Angeles Times, March 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After a year of bitter conflict, Carpinteria&rsquo;s school board voted Tuesday night to retain almost all the Native American imagery that dots the high school campus where residents have cheered on the Warriors since 1928.</p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s special meeting drew hundreds of residents to the school gym, whose outer wall is decorated with a mural of a headress-clad chief surrounded by student athletes. Board members, one of whom survived a recall attempt over the issue, decided in a 3-2 vote to keep the mural and most other Native American likenesses and symbols.</p>
<p>Soon to be gone are the glowering red caricatures on athletic patches and a cartoon-like Indian head profile on floor mats. But the board rejected recommendations by an advisory committee to remove the sculpture of a Plains Indian chief in the parking lot, or to purge the district&rsquo;s logo of a canoe and arrowheads, or to change or eliminate other symbols.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One after another, residents trooped to the microphone Tuesday night to say that the array of images were meant to honor native Americans, not demean them. While other embattled schools have mascots clad in Indian regalia, it has been many years since a similar figure made an appearance at a Carpinteria High game or other event.</p>
<p>A 15-member advisory committee appointed by the board last year was stacked with anti-imagery activists, some speakers complained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other side were people supporting Eli Cordero, a student who triggered the controversy with a complaint to the board last year. Cordero, a 16-year-old junior who is active in Chumash groups, told the board that the images were offensive because they made inappropriate use of native American likenesses and ceremonial items.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve looked into the eyes of the stone Indian and seen the degradation of my ancestors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not here to ask you to remove the images; I&rsquo;m here to tell you to do the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faviana Hirsch, a member of the board&rsquo;s Native American Imagery Committee, suggested the cause may go to &#8220;the newly invigorated U.S. Department of Justice under Barack Obama, who has called for change in this country  &mdash;  if some of you people in Carpinteria haven&rsquo;t noticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At issue were 13 separate images that appear on stickers, patches, T-shirts, and elsewhere on campus. The Warriors&rsquo; name was not in dispute because it appeared ethnically neutral to people who were upset by the images, including Eli Cordero, representatives of the American Indian Movement and other groups.</p>
<p>California legislators have passed measures banning native American mascots at schools, but the bills have twice been vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said such questions should be decided locally.</p>

			<p>&#8220;and seen the degradation of my ancestors&#8221;-from article<br>
Don`t I know it. I have been railing for years against the Valero Energy corp. And it`s formerly named Diamond-Shamrock corner stores. Why? Because of their campaign against muscular dystrophy which utilizes the Shamrock in its charity efforts. Give a dollar and get a Shamrock with your name on it to put in the store window. <br>
 This year as the campaign heated up toward its peak yesterday, I didn`t change a darn thing. But I did get in a triple play. First I complained again, which carries weight because my attitude contrasted so heavily with my usual  happy go lucky nature. Then I got to instruct the minority clerk about fair play, explaining that I don`t see icons of  The Virgin of Guadaloupe being used to cure Heart disease or images of The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King to cure diabetes. All three symbols should stand alone as to their meaning.<br>
  Finally after the clerk went &#8220;ooookayyy&#8221;! I got the real zinger in. I told him I`m from the old school. I expect to be accosted for my change OUTSIDE the damn store!! That left him with a look. <br>
  In closing, a point of clarification. First I no longer visit the store twice daily. Mainly because I no longer buy the morning paper. It`s going on six months that I`ve stopped. But most important my hand gun instructor shared with  me an epiphany. He told me the best way to avoid a confrontaion is not to have a gun. The prudent thing to do is to avoid any place where you think you might need to use one!! No more standing in line behind day laborers buying their beer, or people getting irate if you call them on hogging the counter with scratch -off buy and win and do again like their own personal betting window. Or hookers, or thugs under the streetlight or&hellip;</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s a white &#8216;uncle Tom&rsquo; (hate to use that word)? Is there a word for that? I&rsquo;ll refrain from using the word &#8216;AmRen&rsquo; myself&hellip; I can just see one day some white guy standing before a committee saying we need to remove all the last symbols of whiteness because they are offensive.</p>

			<p>In another 50 years all the Hispanic aka hate Whites studies will programs in our facist marxist racist colleges will be ranting and raving about how evil whitey eliminated Native American high school sports team names and mascots.</p>
<p>A lot of S. California high school sports teams are named &#8220;Vikings&#8221;  It&rsquo;s kind of funny, because the players, cheerleaders and the majority of students are 5ft tall black haired hispanic Indians who look more like Aztecs than Vikings.</p>

			<p>So images of Native Americans offend this young man? </p>
<p>Fine. Tear down all icons of them. Forbid any representation or image of American Indians to be shown. Ever. Make them disappear down the memory hole and see if that makes him happy. He&rsquo;ll  immediately cry &#8220;racism&#8221; and demand that images of Indians be erected everywhere.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m planning to sue Vogue, Cosmo, Glamour and every other fashion and beauty magazine in the country for their depiction of pretty white women.I&rsquo;ll include Essence, Ebony and other black publications because they have pictures of pretty black women and I find pictures of pretty women of any race degrading and offensive.  Why? because I am a pretty woman. I have terrible emotional problems caused by these degrading and offensive sexist and lookist pictures.</p>
<p>I am a pretty white woman and every time I see a magazine  with a pretty white woman on the cover I see the degredation of my ancestors in their blue eyes. I am totally offended.  I am insulted and horrified by the pictures of these women who look a lot like me, my mother, sisters, my nieces and my daughter.</p>
<p>The horror, the horror, the inhumanity, the prejudice, the discrimination.  </p>
<p>I need several vicodine to recover from seeing the latest cover of Vanity Fair on a newstand shelf. Every problem I have ever had and will ever have is caused by my constant exposure to pictures of pretty white women like myself in magazines. I feel so discriminated against and degraded by this evil society.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the models for TV ads.  Everywhere I go I cannot escape these offensive pictures of women who look like me.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll add some 150 proof sherry and some other substances to the vicodine to blot out the horrors of seeing pictures of women who look like me on magazine covers.</p>

			<p>My mother hates Chief Wahoo&hellip;we&rsquo;re of Cherokee descent.  It annoys her, and I more or less shrug.  Sure, I think it&rsquo;s a bit demeaning&hellip;but I have more pressing things to be concerned about, to be honest.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that saying?  Please all, and you please none&hellip;?</p>
