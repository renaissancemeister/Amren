<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama is not the only black leader making history. As of last month, a record five African Americans lead state legislative bodies, and the number of black state lawmakers has reached record levels.</p>
<p>Those leaders are part of a growing movement of African Americans serving in state legislatures, often steppingstones to higher office. The number of black state legislators has risen from 401 in 1986 to a record 628, accounting for 9% of state lawmakers, says Morgan Cullen of the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Obama is part of a breakthrough generation that benefited from the gains made by civil rights leaders, says Gwen Ifill, host of PBS&rsquo; Washington Week and author of The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not race-driven&#8221; and seek support from all voters, she says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign did not prompt more blacks to seek federal office, says David Bositis, political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a private research group. He says the number running for Congress, 56, was lower than in 2004 or 2000 because of a drop in black Republican candidates.</p>
<p>In California, Assembly Speaker Karen Bass is the first black woman to lead any legislature. In Colorado, for the first time in U.S. history, black men, Terrance Carroll and Peter Groff, preside over the House and Senate.</p>
<p>In January, Malcolm Smith became Senate majority leader in New York. In February, Steven Horsford took the same post in Nevada. Both are the first African Americans to lead their legislatures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Voter attitudes toward race are changing dramatically, says Christopher Mooney, professor of political science at the University of Illinois at Springfield.</p>
<p>He says black officials can not only provide diversity of viewpoints but also tighten African Americans&rsquo; connection to government. He says, &#8220;Voters enjoy seeing people like themselves in office.&#8221;</p>

			<p><i>Obama is part of a breakthrough generation that benefited from the gains made by civil rights leaders, says Gwen Ifill, host of PBS&rsquo; Washington Week and author of The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. &ldquo;<b>They&rsquo;re not race-driven</b>&rdquo; and seek support from all voters, she says.</i></p>
<p>Right - I&rsquo;ll assume that 90% of the supposedly-&#8220;Republican&#8221; ones voted for Obama too?</p>
<p><i>He says black officials can not only provide diversity of viewpoints but also <b>tighten African Americans&rsquo; connection to government</b>. He says, &ldquo;<b>Voters enjoy seeing people like themselves in office</b>.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really curious about how non-whites can &#8220;present a diversity of viewpoints&#8221; while white Britons, Spaniards and Estonians&hellip;can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And yet again, I&rsquo;m curious why it matters to non-whites that &#8220;there are people that look like them&#8221; in office yet majority-white areas consistently vote in non-whites to &#8220;leadership&#8221; roles (Dunedin, at one point in time the <i>whitest</i> city in New Zealand, has an Asian mayor!)</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think the number of black-majority state representative and senate districts have increased that much, I think a percentage of them are elected by white pandering liberals.  The Missouri State Representative district for St. Charles, Missouri elected a black Republican for a couple of terms.  And St. Charles is white flight country.</p>
<p>The blacks leading state legislatures are mostly white racial pandering.</p>

<p>Here in Buffalo, we have two local black state legislators. Although the black community knows this and is also fully aware of the rapidly decaying condition of the black community in western New York under black representation, they have black representation and that&rsquo;s all that matters. &#8220;Better to rule in Hell&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>This does not bother me.  It is just the final, &#8220;blow-off&#8221; stage of an exhausted 40-year trend that has run its course and is about to collapse.  You know, like the insane bidding wars for overpriced California real estate in 2006.</p>
<p>The prospects for black politicians and blacks in general are bleak.  The coming struggle will be between latinos and whites.  I can&rsquo;t predict who will win THAT battle, but I CAN predict that blacks will wind up collateral damage.  Kinda like the Poles in WW2.</p>
<p>Oh well&hellip;.</p>

<p>And, this is just part of the ongoing degeneration of this country to third world levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet, no more than a wee few are really qualified to hold the positions they do, and the ones that were elected were voted for by leftist whites who want to show the world how unbiased they are against blacks.</p>
<p>White degeration is occurring also, but it will never match the low level of blacks.</p>

			<p>This graph and its numbers are testimony of nonentity and ignorance of the contemporary white man. <br>
While the white man, being preoccupied with his ball throwing black and Latino &#8220;sports heroes&#8221;, supplies them with his money and time, the heroes&rsquo; brothers use the money and time to steal power in the country to turn it against the white man and his future.</p>

			<p>It will be interesting to see if this trend continues  &mdash;   my guess is that it will not. A wise AmRen poster some weeks ago noted, quite correctly, that years ago White liberals embraced a number of Black Mayors, felt very progressive, gave themselves a big hug, and then seeing how things fell apart, never did so again. </p>

			<p>The Republican Party sold out to Blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals long ago; almost as long ago as the Democrats did. Today, I consider the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Libertarian Party as parties of and for Blacks and other sorted undesirables.</p>
<p>I voted for Chuck Baldwin, of the Constitution Party, during the 2008 election, but I was recently stunned to see (after I wasted my vote) that even the Constitution Party has messages and pictures of diversity on their website. I will not make that mistake again.</p>

			<p>Agree with Alex.  If I belonged to a group that receives special favors from government I would be running for office too.  White men voted to subordinate whites to other races.  There was no need to give preferences to racial groups. Under the orginal foundations of US equal rights can only be found if all have the same rights. Violation of laws is only time rights are relinquished. Today there are many wealthy balcks proportional to whites.<br>
 The civil rights movement is the result of liberal communist undemocratic force. Blacks have generously received entitlements from government that forcefully taxed working whites for transfer of their money to others.  This is akin to legislated stealing&hellip; and this is why more balcks seek office.  They know they want more money and where the money comes from. Blacks have never agreed about US form of government.  Blacks like hispanics vote together while stupid whitey is indoctrinated in public school to feel guilty/bad about his heritage. <br>
Well, now that white culture has been totally demoralized, who will pay for the government entitlements???????   V</p>

<p>Are you serious? That&rsquo;s like asking if tomorrow will come.</p>
<p>To you non-whites and libs:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you all like to pat yourselves on your backs for all the progress you&rsquo;ve made. But really, it reminds me of a bunch of criminals after a night of looting and stealing, and subsequent partying like pennant-winners.</p>
<p>The sum of your work is this: Steal from hard-working and law-abiding people (and those who invent and build things) to feed your perverted and racist movement of socialism.</p>
<p>Good luck sustaining your taxable base with all your black &#8220;officials&#8221;. What part of black leadership history are you fuzzy about, anyhow?</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Steal from hard-working and law-abiding people (and those who invent and build things) to feed your perverted and racist movement of socialism&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Their goal is not only to &#8216;seal from hard-working&rsquo; people but to punish them  &mdash;  and punish them harshly  &mdash;  Whites in particular.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; and other lofty rhetoric from obama and his gang promise that they are experts who are so wise and noble that they, and only they, know what&rsquo;s best for the rest of us and can create a better world. </p>
<p>Obviously, this sort of nonsense has been tried before in the old Soviet Union with 62 million dead and eventual economic collapse as the end result.</p>
<p>As Rush mentioned the other day  &mdash;  their goal is total control over every aspect of our lives  &mdash;  I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more akin to communism than to socialism.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from The Iron Lady (Margaret Thatcher):</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people&rsquo;s money.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It blows me away that nearly all white main has a black police commissioner. <br>
The pieces are being placed to enslave us, but what&rsquo;s interesting is that these officers are pretty weak. </p>

			<p> Blacks enjoy seeing people like themselves in office.

If George Orwell could read the double think in the article,even he would be amazed.  </p>
