<h1>Oak Park Couple Travel Far and Wide to Buy Only From Black-Owned Businesses</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ted Gregory, Chicago Tribune, March 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Maggie Anderson drives 14 miles to buy groceries, which might seem curious given that she lives in bustling Oak Park. She and her husband, John, patronize gas stations in Rockford and Phoenix, Ill. They travel 18 miles to a health food store in Chicago&rsquo;s South Shore neighborhood for vitamins, supplements and personal care products.</p>
<p>The reason? They want to solve what they call &#8220;the crisis in the black community.&#8221; They want to, as they say, &#8220;buy black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Andersons, African-Americans who rose from humble means, are attempting to spend their money for one year exclusively with black-owned businesses and are encouraging other African-Americans to do the same. It is part experiment, part social activism campaign.</p>
<p>They call it the &#8220;Ebony Experiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the Andersons said they also have known that a thriving black economy is fundamental to restoring impoverished African-American and other &#8220;underserved&#8221; communities, and they have discussed for years trying to find a way to address the problem.</p>
<p>What they came up with is provocative. One anonymous letter mailed to their home accused the Andersons of &#8220;unabashed, virulent racism.&#8221; &#8220;Because of you,&#8221; the writer stated, &#8220;we will totally avoid black suppliers. Because of you, we will dodge every which way to avoid hiring black employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apart from that letter, a solid majority of comments they have received have been encouraging, the Andersons said, adding that most people see the endeavor as beneficial to all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The undertaking &#8220;is an academic test about how to reinvest in an underserved community&#8221; and lessen society&rsquo;s burden, John Anderson said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They are using a public relations firm, have created a slick Web site  &mdash;  ebonyexperiment.com  &mdash;  have been laying the groundwork for nearly two years and have enlisted researchers from Northwestern to detail and extrapolate the impact of their spending.</p>
<p>Still, the first two months posed challenges in finding stores that meet what Maggie Anderson called her &#8220;exacting standards.&#8221; Her latest crisis is finding shoes and clothes for the couple&rsquo;s toddler daughters.</p>
<p>The Andersons buy gasoline cards from black-owned stations in Phoenix and Rockford and use the cards elsewhere. After several weeks of searching, Maggie Anderson found Farmers Best Market, 1424 W. 47th St., Chicago, a black-owned grocery 14 miles from their home, and God First, God Last, God Always Dollar and Up General Store, 2243 E. 71st St., a black-owned general merchandise establishment 18 miles from their house.</p>
<p>They moved their personal accounts to Covenant Bank in Chicago but have been unable to switch their mortgage and student loans to black-owned financial institutions. Their utilities payments will continue going to the companies collecting those now. Maggie Anderson said she has struggled to find financial support for the Ebony Experiment&rsquo;s grander plans, and she lamented the campaign&rsquo;s low national prominence.</p>
<p>Lawrence Hamer, associate professor of marketing at DePaul University, called the Andersons&rsquo; project &#8220;brave and courageous&#8221; and said its logic was &#8220;exactly right.&#8221; But it probably will be futile in achieving meaningful impact in the black economy, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although it may be one of the more well-organized and monitored projects of its kind, the Ebony Experiment is not the only buying black venture, said James E. Clingman, a prolific writer on African-American economic empowerment who teaches a class on black entrepreneurship at the University of Cincinnati.</p>
<p>African-Americans have been buying black for more than a century, Clingman said. Booker T. Washington, long an advocate for African-American economic power, was an early proponent, and African-Americans have been forming black-buying cooperatives for decades, Clingman said.</p>
<p>But thriving black businesses began dissolving in the mid-1960s, when African-Americans focused on political power and civil rights and began patronizing white-owned businesses under the misconception that buying white signified blacks&rsquo; upward socioeconomic mobility, Clingman said.</p>

			<p>The black journalist Tony Brown wrote in his book about an enterprising young black who used all of his moolah to start a grocery buisness that hired only blacks.The grocery failed miserably because black or white customers would not buy from it.I am wondering why they didnt?</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t blame them.  I wish more whites would do this.  Jewish-Americans and Asian-Americans have been doing it for decades.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t others not only be able to do it, be encouraged to do it.<br>

			<p>The only black-owned bank in St. Louis, at least about ten years ago, didn&rsquo;t have the total assets in total that one St. Louis street corner branch of a certain national bank had.  I&rsquo;m surprised they found a black bank even in Chicago that had the assets to handle their finances.</p>

			<p>That makes sense to me. I do the same thing except I go out of my way to do business with whites. I also try not to patronize those places where I know people voted for obama. I have done this ever since I heard my africon American next door neighbor tell his black owned loan service that he is only going to hire africon Americans. I was out in my yard when I also heard him say when he is elected to the city council here in north Florida that he was going to solicit black owned business for the town&rsquo;s contracts.</p>
<p>Hey, they look out for their own. Shouldn&rsquo;t we do the same.</p>

			<p>Underserved communities? The Blacks on the West Side of Chicago committed arson and looting on such a large scale that forty years after the riots occurred these same neighborhoods have yet to have recovered. </p>
<p>Having destroyed their own homes and burned out all of the retail stores, these fools complain that they have no local business to visit for shopping.</p>

			<p>If they are willing to go through that much effort to shop in black areas, is it too much to ask if they could live there as well? What could possibly be stopping them from being with those to whom they profess loyalty?</p>

<p>Just rememeber folks that if a white couple travelled far-and-wide to support white-owned-and-run businesses, they&rsquo;d be charged with &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes.</p>
<p>But apart from that, I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is - as long as they also acknowledge the rights of white Americans to do the same-</p>
<p>A man can dream, right?</p>

<p>Finally the tiniest hint of honesty in an article of this type. But even this insight dances around the problem. The whole integrationist movement was also disastrous for blacks (as well as whites) because it encouraged blacks to abandon their own communities while at the same time forcing whites out of theirs. And yet the insanity continues.  The result is an ever-increasing zone of decay for our cities and inner suburbs and sprawl and land waste everywhere else.</p>

<p>Ironically, the web development firm they are using is NOT black-owned or run! If you follow the link on the bottom of their website and then to the &#8220;About Us&#8221; link for their web developer, the most you will find is the statement: &#8220;Our people represent diversity in race, age, gender and interests.&#8221; Wow, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed.</p>

			<p>Another example of hypocrisy in &#8220;the black community.&#8221;  On the one hand they preach (to Whites) we must integrate, but then they do this!</p>
<p>I live in Zoo York City, and I have been in the practice of &#8220;buying White&#8221; for decades, even if it costs me extra.  Sometimes, due to circumstances, I&rsquo;m forced to deal with non-Whites, but mostly I deal with White merchants.</p>

			<p>I hope their choice of medical doctors are all &#8221; affirmative Action &#8221; appointees and a least one of these doctors is the famous case that went to the fraudulent U.S. Supreme Court that contradicted itself with &#8221; racism against whites is wrong but under certain diversity goals; it&rsquo;s O.K. .What hypocritical &#8221; double speak &#8221; ( Bakke case vs.  U.C.L.A.Medical School ) When the grade superior White race Bakke was denied admission because that was of the &#8221; White &#8221; race while an grossly inferior black student took his place in that particular class. When leftist President Clinton had his heart surgery in N.Y.C.; his whole medical team were White Males of European-stock,aka, original Americans, the founding race of this former representative democracy (republic) which ended in the passage of the traitorous, genocidal 1965 A.D. Immigration and Reform Act (of treason).Taxation without representation ever since for original-Americans.</p>

Poor, black-history-ignorant couple.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they understand that their leaders of the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement fought so that they could shop in white stores? Now they want to turn back their back on all their leaders fought for?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that before the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; moment, blacks had everything they needed in their on communities. Now that they have integration, it destroyed their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>NOTHING you do can make these people happy. Each new demand contradicts the last. It&rsquo;s pointless trying to help these people. POINTLESS POINTLESS POINTLESS.</p>

			<p>Jeejay in Frisco,</p>
<p>Years ago, I was working on a job in Brooklyn and there was a small diner (just a couple of booths, counter, grill, etc. A black guy owned it and he had a Chinese grillman. I asked why he didn&rsquo;t hire a black guy for the grill and he said he didn&rsquo;t need a partner, he needed a grillman.</p>
<p>Interesting thing about the grillman. I came in one morning and there was another Chinese guy on the grill. I asked what happened to the other guy and the owner showed me a slip of paper that said he quit and when the black guy showed up to open up the other Chinese guy was there with the slip of paper and he was the new grill man. He was as good as the old guy.</p>
<p>Basically, that hole in the wall diner was the only black owned store I was ever in.</p>

			<p>With all that driving, do they buy gas from Black only gas stations? What type of car do they drive? Was it made by a Black owned company? What about the mint that printed their money? Or the bank that that issued their credit cards? </p>
<p>There use to be a lot of Black owned business here in Greenville, SC and other cities throughout the South and major cities of the North. Remember the scene in the &#8220;Blues Brothers&#8221; of Maxwell St in Chicago? Gone. I think Blacks are just now beginning to realize how much of there culture was destroyed by integration and government handouts.</p>
<p>Now if someone wanted to shop in Hispanic only business, that would be a lot easier. </p>

Black commerce, black mortgages, black utilities, black government and finally their own separate black nation.  </p>

			<p>Any business that gives efficient, courteous service in a safe, clean environment at bargain rates can&rsquo;t help but succeed. Are Blacks incapable of this? Could be, When I worked at the &#8220;Ghetto Home Depot&#8221; in Chicago, a BLACK WOMAN said to me that: &#8220;This is the worst Home Depot I have ever been in.&#8221;</p>

			<p>We demand the right to ride your buses, attend your schools, shop in your stores, work in your businesses, eat in your restaurants, live in your neighbourhood, get home loans like you do. What?? You&rsquo;re claiming we already have those rights? In that case, we want our own buses, our own schools, our own stores, our own businesses, our own restaurants, our own neighbourhoods and our own home loans. Once we have these rights, we will demand the right to ride your buses but you won&rsquo;t be allowed to ride ours, attend your schools&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

			<p>If a White couple in Oak Park advocated doing business exclusively with Whites, the good people of Oak Park would run them out on a rail.  With the tax rates so high in Oak Park, this couple should move to the West or South side of Chicago where their taxes, as well as their minor food dollars could go to their Black brothers and sisters.  Only in Oak Park do they celebrate such overt racism, Black racism anyway. </p>

			<p>Excellent. If all the blacks only shopped at black owned businesses, the crime in white stores will drop drastically. More whites will feel safer shopping, and prices of merchandise will drop.  Now if the blacks would only stay in the communities they have destroyed&hellip;</p>

As soon as my race of people realize that this bogus white integration and liberalism hasn&rsquo;t done nothing for us but harm and choose to do and provide for ourselves, the better off we all will be.  Another thing, we now have to contend with these destructive, non-patriotic, non-conforming, law-breaking Hispanics!</p>
