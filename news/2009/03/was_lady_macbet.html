			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Delingpole, Telegraph (London), March 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On US radio&rsquo;s Garrison show today, I was asked for my reaction as a true born Englishman to President Obama&rsquo;s double insult  &mdash;  first the sending back of the Winston Churchill bust, then his snub to Gordon Brown. &#8220;Tough one. Really tough one,&#8221; I said, torn  &mdash;  as most of surely are  &mdash;  between delight at seeing Brown roundly humiliated, and dismay at having the special relationship so peremptorily, cruelly and bafflingly ruptured.</p>
<p>Iain Martin is quite right here: no matter how utterly rubbish we have become as a nation in the Blair/Brown years, Britain&rsquo;s friendship is something Obama will come to regret having dispensed with so lightly. This was not the act of a global statesman, but of a hormonal teenager dismissing her bestest of best BFs for no other reason than that she felt like it and she can, so there.</p>
<p>What was the guy thinking? In researching my new book Welcome to Obamaland, I discovered that Obama&rsquo;s judgment is pretty dreadful  &mdash;  but this? My favourite theory so far  &mdash;  suggested by presenter Greg Garrison  &mdash;  was that it was a move calculated to please his Lady Macbeth. At the moment in Britain, we&rsquo;re still in the &#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t she look fabulous in a designer frock&#8221; stage of understanding of Michelle Obama. Gradually, though, we&rsquo;ll begin to realise that she is every bit the terrifying executive&rsquo;s wife that Hillary Clinton was. Or, shudder, Cherie Blair.</p>
<p>We may just LURVE Michelle&rsquo;s fashion sense. But Michelle doesn&rsquo;t reciprocate our affection, one bit. Her broad-brush view of history associates Brits with the wicked white global hegemony responsible for the slave trade. Never mind that a white, Tory Englishman  &mdash;  William Wilberforce  &mdash;  brought the slave trade to an end. Judging by her record, Michelle does not make room for such subtle nuance.</p>
<p>Consider her notorious statement that: &#8220;For the first time in my adult life I am really proud of my country.&#8221; Consider her (till-recently suppressed) Princeton thesis, &#8220;Princeton Educated Blacks And The Black Community.&#8221;</p>
<p>In it she writes: &#8220;I have found that at Princeton, no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don&rsquo;t belong. Regardless of the circumstances under which I interact with whites at Princeton, it often seems as if, to them, I will always be black first and a student second.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we see that she has mastered the authentic voice of grievance culture. She also  &mdash;  the thesis was written in 1985  &mdash;  pre-empts the Macpherson report&rsquo;s ludicrous, catch-all definition of racism: &#8220;A racist incident is any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person.&#8221; No matter how hard young Michelle&rsquo;s white undergraduate contemporaries try to be nice, it&rsquo;s not their behaviour that counts, but how Michelle feels.</p>
<p>More worrying, though, and dangerous, than young Michelle&rsquo;s desperate quest for validation through victimhood is the other strain within her thesis. &#8220;As I enter my final year at Princeton,&#8221; she writes. &#8220;I find myself striving for many of the same goals as my White classmates  &mdash;  acceptance to a prestigious graduate or professional school or a high paying position in a successful corporation. Thus, my goals at Princeton are not as clear as before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, exactly, you silly girl&#8221; you want to shriek at young Michelle as you give her a good shake. &#8220;It&rsquo;s called &#8216;opening your mind&rsquo;, &#8216;broadening your experience&rsquo;, &#8216;allowing youthful dogma to be shaped by reality.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s why people go to university, don&rsquo;t you know?&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8642.html">Michelle Obama Thesis Was on Racial Divide</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jeffrey Ressner, The Politico, February 22, 2008</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Michelle Obama&rsquo;s senior year thesis at Princeton University, obtained from the campaign by Politico, shows a document written by a young woman grappling with a society in which a black Princeton alumnus might only be allowed to remain &#8220;on the periphery.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The thesis, titled &#8220;Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community&#8221; and written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, in 1985, has been the subject of much conjecture on the blogosphere and elsewhere in recent weeks, as it has been &#8220;temporarily withdrawn&#8221; from Princeton&rsquo;s library until after this year&rsquo;s presidential election in November. Some of the material has been written about previously, however, including a story last year in the Newark Star Ledger.</p>
<p>Obama writes that the path she chose by attending Princeton would likely lead to her &#8220;further integration and/or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society; never becoming a full participant.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attempts to retrieve the document through Princeton proved unsuccessful, with school librarians having been pestered so much for access to the thesis that they have resorted to reading from a script when callers inquire about it. Media officers at the prestigious university were similarly unhelpful, claiming it is &#8220;not unusual&#8221; for a thesis to be restricted and refusing to discuss &#8220;the academic work of alumni.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Obama campaign, however, quickly responded to a request for the thesis by Politico. {snip}</p>
<p>The 1985 thesis provides a trove of Michelle Obama&rsquo;s thoughts as a young woman, with many of the paper&rsquo;s statements describing the student&rsquo;s world as seen through a race-based prism.</p>
<p>&#8220;In defining the concept of identification or the ability to identify with the black community,&#8221; the Princeton student wrote, &#8220;I based my definition on the premise that there is a distinctive black culture very different from white culture.&#8221; Other thesis statements specifically pointed to what was seen by the future Mrs. Obama as racially insensitive practices in a university system populated with mostly Caucasian educators and students: &#8220;Predominately white universities like Princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments.&#8221;</p>
<p>To illustrate the latter statement, she pointed out that Princeton (at the time) had only five black tenured professors on its faculty, and its &#8220;Afro-American studies&#8221; program &#8220;is one of the smallest and most understaffed departments in the university.&#8221; In addition, she said only one major university-recognized group on campus was &#8220;designed specifically for the intellectual and social interests of blacks and other third world students.&#8221; (Her findings also stressed that Princeton was &#8220;infamous for being racially the most conservative of the Ivy League universities.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most germane subjects approached in the thesis is a section in which she conveyed views about political relations between black and white communities. She quotes the work of sociologists James Conyers and Walter Wallace, who discussed &#8220;integration of black official(s) into various aspects of politics&#8221; and notes &#8220;problems which face these black officials who must persuade the white community that they are above issues of race and that they are representing all people and not just black people,&#8221; as opposed to creating &#8220;two separate social structures.&#8221;</p>
<p>To research her thesis, the future Mrs. Obama sent an 18-question survey to a sampling of 400 black Princeton graduates, requesting the respondents define the amount of time and &#8220;comfort&#8221; level spent interacting with blacks and whites before they attended the school, as well as during and after their University years. Other questions dealt with their individual religious beliefs, living arrangements, careers, role models, economic status, and thoughts about lower class blacks. In addition, those surveyed were asked to choose whether they were more in line with a &#8220;separationist and/or pluralist&#8221; viewpoint or an &#8220;integrationist and/or assimilationist&#8221; ideology.</p>
<p>Just under 90 alums responded to the questionnaires (for a response rate of approximately 22 percent) and the conclusions were not what she expected. &#8220;I hoped that these findings would help me conclude that despite the high degree of identification with whites as a result of the educational and occupational path that black Princeton alumni follow, the alumni would still maintain a certain level of identification with the black community. However, these findings do not support this possibility.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Obama failed in the ancient ritual of European gift-giving. Very very sad day for our country, and relation to our country&rsquo;s ally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently the two heads of state of the most powerful Anglo-Saxon nations exchanged gifts in a time-honored tradition and ritual.</p>
<p>One side showed the utmost courtesy and respect, while the other snubbed the former.</p>
<p>Was it cultural ignorance or meaningful contempt?</p>
<p>You be the judge, but to a European with any sense of history, or gentlemanly demeanor this was a snub that would have ended in a dual, in more civilized times.</p>
<p>What will the new &#8216;coalition of the willing&rsquo; be? The USSA, Iran, Cuba, and Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>I hope Europeans are taking note of the utter humiliation and contempt that multiculturalism brings for their traditions, and time-honored rituals.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder if she also believes the Roots-inspired myth that - despite West Africa being colloquially called &#8220;The White Man&rsquo;s Grave&#8221; (from diseases and hostile natives) - white slavers ravaged West Africa, as opposed to the more historically-accurate view that black chieftains and kings merely sold off prisoners and slaves from rival tribes?</p>
<p>But yes, Michelle Obama certainly seems &#8220;racially-aggrieved&#8221; to say the least - made more horrifying when you realise that when she shouts, Barack jumps&hellip;</p>

			<p>And this is the same Obama who said that Bush was arrogant and we needed to improve foreign relations.  He&rsquo;s chucking one of our most reliable allies.</p>
<p>As for the thesis, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s doing this as much for his wife than he is for himself.  The theory is that he&rsquo;s getting back at the UK for their colonization of Kenya.  Trouble is, there was no such thing as &#8220;Kenya&#8221; before the colonial period, there were just transient entities known as tribes constantly coming in contact with each other, the Luo being one of them.  All &#8220;Kenya&#8221; is is merely a British partition of that part of East Africa, the colonial boundaries remained even after colonialism.  Kenya just happened to have some of the Luo tribe, and some others.  Hence the biggest problem with Africa today, that colonial boundaries give no regard to tribal movements.</p>

			<p>It dumbfounds me to see what some Whites, especally young Whites see in this woman. If you get on websites like wonkette, slate, salon even moderate republcan.com, among others, you would think this woman was the best looking, intelligent person ever!</p>
<p>Yesterday, in an upscale coffeeshop, I overheard a group of White males probably in their mid 20s to early 30s discussing this woman and how they would marry her in a heartbeat. I was incredulous!</p>
<p>A few weeks earlier, I heard some White females mention how they are watching every move Michelle Obama makes in regards to her fashion sense so they can imitate her!<br>
 <br>
It is bad enough that this anti-White bigot is our first lady, let alone having some supposedly decent upper class Whites worship her!</p>
<p>Our nation is in sad state of afairs!</p>

			<p>This is what the White race has come to? Worshiping first, Obama and now Michelle?  How on God&rsquo;s green earth did this happen? What is wrong with Whites and where is their racial pride? To copy the likes of Michelle or Obama is treason to their own kind.  And I am sure they will be the reason for the destruction of the White race. Hope they are proud of themselves, because I am totally ashamed and embarrassed of these blind White masses.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does Michelle Obama blame Britain for black slavery?&#8221;</p>
<p>She blames ALL whites for black slavery, and for black incompetence and lack of intelligence.  And, she isn&rsquo;t bright enough to know that she was awarded a degree on work that was strictly high school level by the grace of whitey, so those like her would stop whining and blaming everyone for black problems.</p>
<p>Certainly though it&rsquo;s obvious it didn&rsquo;t work.  As it does with blacks, it made her worse.</p>

			<p>Tim Mc Hugh: Lady Macbeth, I believe, convinced her husband to kill the scottish king and take the thrown. </p>
<p>I seem to recall that Clinton did similar things with the British prime minister. It seems to be a ritual for democrats - to show their contempt for Anglo Saxons, even when they are anglo saxons like Clinton.</p>
<p>I do think we&rsquo;re just seeing the begining of the Obama&rsquo;s behavior and radical politics. No matter how the media covers it up, eventually the angry black woman will have her day. </p>

<p>I wonder how Michelle feels about &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo; who ruminate on their whiteness? She basically separates, and defines herself as black, at every possible opportunity and then says it&rsquo;s all because of the way whites are.</p>

			<p>It must be terrible for poor Michelle to live in such a racist country, and attend such a racist university.  Her only recourse was to submit a thinly-disguised race baiting thesis devoid of critical thinking and focusing on her feelings.  Imagine her surprise when it was accepted, who could&rsquo;ve forseen that the race card would work in academia!?</p>

			<p><i>Kenya just happened to have some of the Luo tribe, and some others. Hence the biggest problem with Africa today, that colonial boundaries give no regard to tribal movements.</i></p>
<p>I see where you&rsquo;re coming from, but I don&rsquo;t believe there was <i>any</i> way that colonial European or independant black African governments could&rsquo;ve divided the lands of sub-Saharan Africa without conflict.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to remember that <i>no</i> black African kingdoms or empires managed to completely assimilate their component and/or conquered tribes into a single ethnicity identified with a nation-state:<br>
While the Angles, Jutes, Saxons and native Britons simply became &#8220;English&#8221;, the Celts of France became &#8220;Roman&#8221; etc the Mande didn&rsquo;t became &#8220;Songhai&#8221; etc. Kingdoms and empires rose and fell but the conquerors and conquered were - at the end of the day - <i>still</i> tribes X, Y and Z.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that argument a lot, and I&rsquo;ve gotta say that (for good or ill) the European colonial solution - whence land was divided according to European political maneuvering) - was probably the best:<br>
How would you divide a hypothetical Country X between Tribe A (40% of Country X population), Tribe B (35% of Country X population) and Tribe C (25% of Country X population)?<br>
Divide by proportion of population? Tribe B and Tribe C are unhappy.<br>
Divide by &#8220;ancestral&#8221; lands? Tribe A is angry because Tribes B and C get the highlands with good farming soil while Tribe A is stuck with impenetrable jungle.</p>
<p>Either way, there&rsquo;s gonna be war - it&rsquo;s better to tie them to artifical nations than watching Tribe A exterminate Tribe C for the &#8220;good&#8221; land.</p>

			<p>I may be in the minority here, but I don&rsquo;t really see why the British are having convulsions, just because Obama returned a bust of Churchill. </p>
<p>One of the reasons the USA is in Iraq, is because Bush believed Blair&rsquo;s lies about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction. Believing the lies of a supposed &#8220;ally&#8221; can be as dangerous as believing the lies of an adversary. The ONLY reason we regard Britain as an &#8220;ally&#8221; is because of the two world wars we fought in the 20th century, primarily to save the British Empire ( I especially feel this true of the First World War).</p>
<p>Britain shoved multiculturalism down the throats of their subjects, and now they are surprised that Obama is behaving the way he is. And to think that Nick Griffin and Mark Collett were arrested, because they resisted swallowing the multicultural lies that Britain issued forth. It serves Britain right, since they fawned over the Obamas like hounds.</p>
<p>On a sidebar, American women have often taken their fashion cues from the president&rsquo;s wife; nothing new there. Remember when Jackie Kennedy wore those stupid-looking pilbox hats? Many American women aped her, in that respect. They also followed her every move.</p>

<p>How can either of these &#8220;leaders&#8221;  (particularly ours) claim to be heads of &#8220;Anglo-Saxon nations&#8221;?   What a farce!  As for the other &#8220;leader&#8221;&hellip;  I have less sympathy for that one who is more a traitor to his own kind than ours (at least doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be our own kind).</p>
<p><b><i>One side showed the utmost courtesy and respect, while the other snubbed the former.</i></b></p>
<p>No, one side cringed and groveled, as it has been doing for many years now. Obama/Caesar merely let his satrap know who is boss.  Now, some of the offended toadies are whining about lack of respect.  Rubbish!  After so many years of  shamelessly selling out their own people, they don&rsquo;t deserve any. I&rsquo;m glad to see them get what they deserve &hellip;and from one of the very types they have adulated!  Perfect.  So how does Europe still love Obama now? Are they still thrilled?  I hope they all get a taste of it. </p>
<p><b><i>Was it cultural ignorance or meaningful contempt?</i></b></p>
<p>Well, whatever it was, it is clear that we have in this  historic year of 2009 passed a crucial milestone which is worth noting, one from which there can be no turning back. We are now under non-white (or anti-majority) rule, and there is no longer any hiding the fact.   </p>
<p>Why continue to kid ourselves?  This is no longer an &#8220;Anglo-Saxon nation!&#8221;   It hasn&rsquo;t  been for a long time.  And now it is no longer even a European, or Caucasian, nation.   At this point, it doesn&rsquo;t even pretend to be.   And perhaps neither is Britain.   It&rsquo;s time that we all, as they say, &#8220;wake up and smell the coffee&#8221;. That includes the starry-eyed  Obamaniacs in Europe.  Maybe this jolt of reality will bring them out of their trance.</p>
<p><b><i>The theory is that he&rsquo;s getting back at the UK for their colonization of Kenya. </i></b></p>
<p>Ah, payback for a Luo tribesman&hellip;it must be sweet!   How dare the evil British bring civilization and progress to his people. How humiliating.</p>
<p><b><i>Trouble is, there was no such thing as &ldquo;Kenya&rdquo; before the colonial period;  there were just transient entities known as tribes &hellip; the Luo being one of them. </i></b></p>
<p>True. Kenya was a CREATION of Britain.  Without the  British, it would still be just a random collection of warring, primitive tribes.  (But don&rsquo;t tell Obama that.)</p>
<p><b><i>It dumbfounds me to see what some Whites see in this woman. If you get on websites like wonkette, slate, salon even moderate republcan.com, among others, you would think this woman was the best looking, intelligent person ever! </i></b></p>
<p>Have you been in any news shops?   The magazine covers, one after another, are all plastered with her!  She&rsquo;s the new queen of fashion, taste, and class&hellip; Jackie Kennedy and Dolly Madison rolled into one.<br>

			<p>No, Othello is a terrible reference as his wife, Desdemona, was white.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Europeans are taking note of the utter humiliation and contempt that multiculturalism brings for their traditions, and time-honored rituals.&#8221; </p>
<p>Once again, we want separatism then you expect a non-European to be like us? Winston Churchill is a terribly overrated leader anyway if you hate immigration. It was mainly a collective white guilt post-colonialism that is still allowing immigrants to pour in unabated into Europe. Churchill was imperialisms biggest proponent and apologist.A white leader should have the guts to reject say an ANC &#8220;tribal gift&#8221; in protest, give him credit.</p>
<p>When it comes to busts, keep it apolitical if you are a European gift giving country: Robert Burns, TS Eliot, Sophia Loren, Anita Ekberg etc</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Michelle Obama was behind the snub or not but, either way, it was embarassing.  Brown gave Obama several expensive, rare, and thought-out gifts; Obama gave him 25 DVDs that Brown could have purchased on e-Bay for $5 each.  I actually heard some Obamabots defending this, saying that it just shows that Obama is focused on more important things.  Obama is throwing cocktail parties every night in the White House but can&rsquo;t find the time to tell one of his numerous staff members to pick out a decent president for the leader of one of our biggest allies?  <br>
I don&rsquo;t know what - if anything - it will take for Americans to wake up to what an incompotent moron this guy is, but, as an America I am ashamed of this latest episode and apologize to any Brits who may be reading this. (Although, he is the president you guys wanted, right?)</p>

			<p>Never forget that the Obama family before entering the national spotlight were very active members of one of the most radical and racist churches in America, even drug their young children there to be indoctrinated.</p>

			<p>What did the Brits expect?  Browns lucky he got the DVD&rsquo;s.  Obama despises Britain.  He&rsquo;s much more comfortable with Palestinians or Arabs.  As far as Michelle-my-Belle?  She&rsquo;s what gins up all the racial hatred in her empty suit of a husband.  She&rsquo;s and George Soros are the puppet-master&rsquo;s pulling on Obama&rsquo;s strings.  When the average American wakes up to this charade, it&rsquo;s gonna be too late.  </p>

			<p>The media are slobbering over this fraud for a first lady.  She and her husband are forgiven for their racism and elevated to a king and queen status that is undeserving.  I keep hearing about how brilliant Obama is and then I just read he always uses a teleprompter.  I suspect that is because he naturally sounds too street or ghetto.  Hell, I could be president and sound brilliant with a teleprompter while speaking to the stupid masses!</p>

			<p>If this was a snub and not just the usual incompetence, I wonder how long it will take for it to sink in to the British public.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen of the BBC&rsquo;s coverage, they are even more pro-Obama than the US media.  Even in Japan the Obama brand is hyped.</p>
<p>Given that Kim Jong Il is apparently a movie buff, maybe there was a mix up in gifts?</p>

			<p>During the election, &amp; even afterwards, countless Europeans prostrated themselves before this empty suit. Part of me hopes he returns the favor by insulting all of them.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be just what they deserve&hellip;?  </p>

<p>It would be nice if she could be pro-black without being anti-white.  People should be pro-their own race.  But it shouldn&rsquo;t have to mean being anti-the other races.</p>

			<p>  If there are any Brits reading here, please be advised, I, and many millions of others value and cherish our relationship with Great Britain and other European countries. My ancestors were English, Irish, and Scottish, and probably Welsh. I hold the countries of my ancestry dear to my heart. Sadly, I cannot say the same for this country (U.S.) any longer. Many would say I should leave the U.S. if I feel this way. I am working on it. I no longer feel at home ina country that my people came to over 267 years ago. I have visited the U.K. a couplr of times, I feel a kindred bond with the NATIVE Brits. I have felt the anger and helplessness that they feel over the traitors throwing away their country. I feel I could better serve the cause of white people in England. That is, if I can get permission to remain there.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t really see why the British are having convulsions, just because Obama returned a bust of Churchill. <br>
One of the reasons the USA is in Iraq, is because Bush believed Blair&rsquo;s lies about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction. Believing the lies of a supposed &ldquo;ally&rdquo; can be as dangerous as believing the lies of an adversary.&#8221;<br>
soprano Fan</p>
<p>Am I naive?  I thought it was the OTHER way around.  I thought Britain is stuck in Iraq too, however unwilling, because of Bush and his lies.  </p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s that so many lies have been told that it&rsquo;s getting hard to remember which is which and who lied to whom.<br>

			<p>Why the outrage over an utterly unsubstantiated thesis?  Like it or not, she is our first lady and HE is our president.  Everything from our butting into WWI till now has culminated with this fact.  The &#8220;greatest&#8221; generation changed the immigration laws in the mid-60&rsquo;s while the boomers were still in school.  Brit-Americans have turned on every other White ethnicity and are now complaining that the Black people they empowered have taken power.  Most Brits see their American cousins as dumb peasants.  I tend to agree.</p>

			<p>I haven&rsquo;t been following the doings of America&rsquo;s first couple, and I may be way off base here, but Michelle Obama does not look to me like a model of feminine pulchritude, even allowing for her obvious genetic handicaps.  Nobody seems to have noticed that she looks like one of those muscle-bound female bodybuilders. I haven&rsquo;t seen any swimsuit pictures (would probably be struck blind), but those trapezius muscles (beside her neck) sure look like the product of much weight training.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I will always be black first and a student second.&#8221; Says it all, does it not? Typical racist drivel. This coming from a down trodden black woman, who has obviously been severely punished by whites.</p>

			<p>Basically young Ms Obama&rsquo;s whole world revolves around blackness, she basically follows the black nazi line on campus, and explaining it all she says it&rsquo;s because whites are racist and evil. </p>

			<p>Thank you our kindred Americans for your concern at the slight in this exchange. Neither the black president nor the Marxist Labour prime minister will be popular with Amren readers. The former appears to have a strong New World Order backing, while the latter recently depreciated his Scottish heritage saying he is more of an internationalist. Brown is always expressing his support for a new world order. I have a copy of the book &#8216;The New world Order&rsquo; 1940, by H G Wells outlining the end of sovereign states and a mass movement of populations. Wells was a member of the Fabian Society which is connected to Labour, is consulted by them and helps to form their policies. It is surprising that two leaders of a similar political hue did not show a more cordial relationship. The president&rsquo;s attempt at talking economics was not impressive - the US news presenter commented &#8216;Our president is not an economist&rsquo;. The whole episode was a fiasco - America deserves better.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does Michelle Obama blame Britain for black slavery?&#8221;</p>
<p>A more reasonable question might be &#8220;What sane individual gives a rip WHAT Michelle Obama pretends to think?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet she can also pretend to read, but I&rsquo;m not about to ask her what she thought of Fuller&rsquo;s postwar interviews with Guderian and Manstein.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not. A few people in the media are harping on about it, that&rsquo;s all. We have other things to worry about.</p>
<p>We know that Obama is not America just as the BBC is not Britain. Anyway, he&rsquo;ll be gone in 8 years or less. As for Brown - well he&rsquo;s circling the drain anyway so who cares?</p>

			<p>Perhaps MO is unaware that Britain abolished the slave trade long before the American Civil War settle the matter in this country.  The Royal Navy was actively engaged in chasing down slave ships and hanging their captains up until our Civil War.</p>
<p>Of course, perhaps that&rsquo;s why Michelle seems rather cool toward the British.  They denied untold millions of black Africans the opportunity to escape the hell that was 19th Century Africa and come to the Americas.</p>

			<p>If intentional, this slight is inexplicable and demonstrates an even greater arrogance and tactlessness than the previous administration.  If unintentional, it exposes the incompetence of &#8220;our&#8221; president.  I don&rsquo;t know which scenario is more troubling.</p>
<p>You can see the typical liberal tactic of setting up a &#8220;straw-man&#8221; argument in the original article&rsquo;s comments.  About half of the commenters claim to think that the outrage is about the disparity in the perceived &#8220;price&#8221; of the gifts.  It&rsquo;s obvious that the true grievance here is the thought and historical weight of the gifts.</p>
<p>Brown gave Obama one priceless artifact and one irreplaceable heirloom.  Obama gave Brown a small collection of mass-produced DVDs that any of us could pick up at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>The top 25 AFI DVDs would be a fun gift for a film buff at Christmas.  For a ceremonial exchange between close allies, it&rsquo;s a gravely insulting faux pas.</p>

<p>4 years later she wrote her &#8220;thesis&#8221; on race at her university.</p>
<p>What remarkable strides she must have made in college.</p>

<p>You have a point there.  I wish we could leave them out, but the media won&rsquo;t allow it. They are pushed on us at every juncture.  I was browsing at a newsstand this evening, and I see that even Vogue has Michelle on its cover.  So now she is the icon of High Fashion!  She is everywhere. The magazines are all ga-ga over our good-looking new First Family.</p>
