<h1>VA Hospital Pulls &#8216;Japs Surrender&rsquo; Headline from Historical Display</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pete Winn, CNN, March 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The director of the VA hospital in Indianapolis has removed a World War II-era newspaper front page from a historical display at the hospital because it contains the headline, &#8220;Japs Surrender.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hospital has replaced it with another newspaper, whose headline says &#8220;Peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda Jeffrey, the public affairs officer at the Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis, explained the action.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a hallway in our outpatient clinics that has a lot of different military memorabilia  &mdash;  artifacts if you will. Some of them are newspaper ads  &mdash;  &#8216;Buy Bonds!&rsquo;  &mdash;  and things like that. This particular artifact was an original newspaper story from the Indianapolis Times, dated Aug. 14, 1945,&#8221; Jeffrey told CNSNews.com.</p>
<p>The item had been on display for 10 years, she said, until a month ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our new employees contacted the director, Tom Mattice, and told him that particular military memorabilia was particularly offensive to people of Japanese origin. So our director asked that we take it down,&#8221; Jeffrey added.</p>
<p>Local Marine Corps veterans were outraged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of a couple of thousands of e-mails, letters and phone calls, we&rsquo;ve received, only two thought he (the VA hospital director) the right thing,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Vietnam vet Don Myers, Indiana&rsquo;s most decorated veteran, labeled the VA&rsquo;s action as &#8220;political correctness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any Marine will tell you that, in this day and age, they damn well know the term &#8216;Jap&rsquo; is a rude and insulting remark  &mdash;  that is not the issue,&#8221; Myers said. &#8220;But you&rsquo;ve got people here who are trying to change history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myers said he personally spoke to director Mattice to make his case.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;What if that headline had said &#8216;Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor?&rsquo; Would you have taken that one down?&rsquo; And he said, I have no more to say to you, Mr. Myers,&rsquo; and hung up.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The VA&rsquo;s Ethics Office supported the director&rsquo;s action, [Linda Jeffrey] added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Floyd Mori, national executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, applauded the medical center for its action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although it&rsquo;s of World War II vintage, we feel it sends a wrong kind of a message to today&rsquo;s generation and so we&rsquo;re concerned about it, we&rsquo;re glad it was taken down, and we support the new director there that felt the need to do so,&#8221; Mori told CNSNews.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think historical artifacts certainly have their place, perhaps in museums, where an educational element of the artifact is alongside the piece itself,&#8221; Mori added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;No, this is a veterans&rsquo; hospital,&#8221; Myers said. &#8220;This is not the community hospital, or city hospital or general hospital  &mdash;  this is a veterans&rsquo; hospital. Yes, it is a museum. That&rsquo;s why we have the Hall of Honor there  &mdash;  with all these news clippings, and all these photos. And all these people&rsquo;s names  &mdash;  and the actions they were involved in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last Civil War veteran from Indiana died in this hospital. The last Spanish War veteran died in this hospital. The last World War I veteran from Indiana died in this hospital. It had men pass through who saw the flag- raising on Iwo Jima, (who) fought in all the famous battles of World War II, Korea, right on down the line through Vietnam to present day. You tell me this is not a museum? Yes it is. It&rsquo;s a historical place.&#8221;</p>
<p>While individual veterans may be incensed, meanwhile, veterans groups are not getting involved.</p>
<p>The American Legion, for one, has decided not to take an official position on the issue, according to Steve Short, adjutant for the Legion&rsquo;s Indiana department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mori, meanwhile, said the use of term &#8220;Jap&#8221; was officially condemned by Congress in 1986.</p>
<p>House Concurrent Resolution 290, which was passed on July 24, 1986, acknowledged that the term &#8220;Jap&#8221; was &#8220;racially derogatory and offensive&#8221; and endorsed the use of the abbreviation &#8220;Jpn&#8221; as the &#8220;appropriate&#8221; and &#8220;easily recognizable and racially inoffensive abbreviation for the terms &#8216;Japan&rsquo; and &#8216;Japanese.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

			<p>Perhaps so, but back in the days when the United States of America set out actually to win wars, it/we employed knowingly false and distorted and bigoted caricatures of the enemy.  That&rsquo;s just what you have to do to win wars.  Don&rsquo;t forget, Germans were portrayed just as badly, even as a good chunk of the American military were German-American.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that we&rsquo;re bogged down against ragtag insurgents on the other side of the world?  At the same time that our Vets hospitals want to censor pro-victory messages?  There&rsquo;s a correlation between the two.</p>

			<p>&hellip;Because according to the western zeitgeist, whites are inferior to east Asians.  Shortening &#8220;British&#8221; to &#8220;Brits&#8221; is fine.  Shortening &#8220;Scottish&#8221; to &#8220;Scot&#8221; is fine.  Calling people of English descent &#8220;Anglos&#8221; (the hispanic word for us!) is fine.  But shortening &#8220;Japanese&#8221; to &#8220;Jap&#8221; or &#8220;Nipponese&#8221; to &#8220;Nip&#8221; or &#8220;Pakistani&#8221; to &#8220;Paki&#8221; is R-A-C-I-S-M.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not allowed to have an identity, or even speak of having an identity, but if we spell &#8220;Hindu&#8221; as &#8220;Hindoo&#8221; we&rsquo;re evil.</p>

			<p>Mfather was an iwo veteran. He has passed away but I am certain that if he heard of this he would be more then angry.  What did these WWII veterans fight for?  I am certain that the &#8220;Japs&#8221; have no concerns about hurting the feelings of the American,British or other allies that they slaughtered and tortured during the war!!</p>

			<p>I just wonder when the demands are going to start to made that any reference to America&rsquo;s victory of Japan in WWll be completely omitted in the history books because it will be deemed &#8220;offensive&#8221; to Asians? Of course, it will still be okay to rub the Germans nose in it because they are white.</p>

			<p>I had to calm down for awhile so that my language would not be totally unacceptable for posting on AMREN.  I guess this underscores in my mind the inescapable truth that it&rsquo;s not OK to offend anyone of any race in the USA except the White American Male, who is supposed to accept all kinds of offenses without saying a word.  Mattice is the worst kind of coward and politically correct fool.  The freedoms that he and the rest of us enjoy in this country were purchased by the blood of men who fought in all wars from the Revolution on down.  Thank heavens our country didn&rsquo;t have to rely on the likes of Mattice to defend it. A curse upon him and his minions and all who think as he does.</p>

			<p>Next we&rsquo;ll be &#8216;informed&rsquo; Japan did not really attack us on December 7th, 1941&hellip; that it was all a mistake. That those Japanese aircraft were on a goodwill visit and trigger-happy soldiers and sailors simply started shooting at the Jap aircraft, which of course, had to defend themselves, best as they could.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll hear those horror stories about Japanese atrocities in the conquered nations were simply mass hysteria. That no civilian locals were murdered, tortured, raped by Japanese soldiers. Those atrocities in China were all fabrications&hellip; propaganda spread by China and the Americans to give the Japs a bad name.</p>
<p>That captured American and Allied prisoners of war were treated oh, so humanely. Housed in the best available local hotels. Served better food than that enjoyed by the Japanese at home. </p>
<p>MAYBE IT&rsquo;S TIME TO DEMAND OUR PANDERING OFFICALS START REVISITING THE TRUTH! Instead of sucking up to our former enemies. Granted the war is more than 60 years in the past, but truth is still truth! No matter how special interest groups or politicians try to twist facts for political purposes.</p>
<p>Japan, from what I&rsquo;ve read, is still unwilling to offer apology to its Chinese and other victims for the horrific atrocities its troops committed on conquered civilian populations.</p>

			<p>In another way, pulling that headline is an insult to EVERY American who fought in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Making an utter mockery of their valor and sacrifices to wrest victory from the smoking ashes and wreckage of Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>There is far too much DOWNPLAYING of the fact Japan started the war that resulted in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. NO, not just with the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The war for Japan really started when the first attack on another country was launched by Japan. By the atrocities committed on the conquered civilian populations. The popular myth being we put restrictive embargoes on Japan prior to Dec. 7th, 1941&hellip; while the truth is those embargoes were heavily in response to Japan&rsquo;s acts of aggression in the Western Pacific&hellip; China, Manchuria. Later the island nations conquered during the early stages of war were horrific examples of Japanese brutality at its worst!</p>
<p>While we cannot blame today&rsquo;s Japanese people for the many acts of barbarism by their ancestors, it is a moral outrage to try to downplay or hide the ugly truth about Japan&rsquo;s wartime history for the sake of political expediency.</p>

<p>Well, I find the fact that the Japanese got us into WWII offensive.  I find it offensive that my grandfathers had to put their college and family lives on hold and almost get killed the process to stop those Japanese who were mean SOBs.  They murdered over 100,000 people in China.  Remember the Rape of Nanking?</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve caved to political correctness again. I&rsquo;ve also been listening to the discussions on the news (Fox) on the re-writing of our kid&rsquo;s textbooks. I&rsquo;ve lived a long time and don&rsquo;t even recognize some of the &#8220;facts&#8221; presented by textbook publishers. Many have religious misstatements, and others have changed historical facts. Why? Is this just another trap to pull us into accepting globalization or an aethiest society?</p>

			<p>When you think of the folks that went down and signed up to fight the Japanese after Pearl Harbor, how some of them sacrificed their lives or were maimed, the families that were notified and had to live with it their whole life; the one consolation being, they died in a good cause for their people. Now we&rsquo;re told it was nothing or next to nothing. If those that died fighting for one of those islands saw today&rsquo;s world, what would they think? As T.S. Eliot wrote: &#8220;Flesh cannot stand too much reality.&#8221; This is one example. It&rsquo;s enough to break your heart. Our Elite tell us they died for ideas found in the  Constitution. Die for bloodless, chimerically shifting things like ideas? : what a cruel lie!</p>

<p>I was told once that in Japan Pearl Harbor is called &#8220;the battle of Pearl Harbor&#8221; rather than for the cowardly attack that it was.</p>

			<p>Here is something to think about:if some the grandchildren of the &#8220;Jap&#8221;s who were memebers of the Japanese imperial army during WW2 come to America Legally they will qualify for a Gates scholarship. Outrageous to think about isn&rsquo;t it? It very likely has already happened. Several thousand of them have already come to America LEGALLY since the passage of the 1965 immigration reform act.</p>
<p>And you can be sure that these new post-1965 Japanese &#8220;Americans&#8221; are voting in every election to make Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. Just a reminder:if you vote Republican at election time, you cast your vote for reducing Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>It is now one minute before midnight for Native Born White Americans within the borders of America.</p>

<p>As my father and father-n-law (both WWII navy vets and now deceased) said, the atom bomb apologists weren&rsquo;t bobbing around off the coast of Japan waiting to invade a country in an operation which the U.S. military was willing to accept ONE MILLION!! casualties in the initial invasion.

<p>Of course it was the communists who defeated fascist Germany, and so it was the communist Chinese who tied down the bulk of Japan&rsquo;s army and were fighting Japan almost about half a decade before American entered the war. </p>
<p>But communists do not support the cold-blooded executions of hundreds of thousands of completely innocent civilians in order to accomplish a <b>military</b> objective. My father had a life-long hatred of the Japanese, but he never cheered the atomic bombings. </p>
<p>The atomic bombings were the worst case of mass terrorism ever.</p>
<p>The American soldiers were cowards whose victory rested not on feat of arms, but the murder of woman and children.</p>
<p>As for WWII propaganda it was always &#8220;Japs and Nazis.&rsquo; Thus all Japanese people were condemned, but only Nazi germans were. That is the difference.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;atomic bomb apologists weren&rsquo;t bobbing around off the coast of Japan waiting to invade&hellip;&#8221;  SKIP at 9:51.  There are, or were, liberals who favored the A-bombs.  Among them was Professor Paul Fussell, a well known literary critic and observer of class in American life.  As a wounded veteran of Europe, slated for the invasion of Japan, he bitterly criticized the anti-bomb intellectuals for their armchair compassion.  They were willing to see Americans die because none of them or their friends would have been among the dead.  </p>

			<p>If I recall correctly, several years ago, there was to be a WWII remembrance day or something at the Smithsonian Museum in DC.  They invited a bunch of WWII vets but then there was some controversy over a display about the U.S. dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and they wanted to remove it because it would have been offensive to Japanese attendees.  If I also remember correctly, some of the WWI vets were pretty peeved and threatened not to attend.</p>
<p>Anybody else remember that story?  Those WWII vets - they really are what this country is supposed to be about.  Strong, gutsy and opinionated.</p>

			<p>How about &#8220;Yank&#8221; or &#8220;Mick,&#8221; for Americans and Irish? Would those words in headlines be removed? The word used to shorten the name for Japanese was often done in newspapers in the interest of space. I recall, as a child, coming from a movie on Sunday, December 7, and hearing the newsboys shouting, &#8220;Extra, extra, read all about it&hellip;&#8221;Japs bomb Pearl Harbor.&#8221; Most of us thought nothing of the shortened name. Our worry was: Where was Pearl Harbor? Then, all through the war, the movies about the various battles in the Pacific referred to the enemy as &#8220;Japs.&#8221; Why all of a sudden are we so politically correct? You can bet other countries have more choice names for us than we know!</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The American soldiers were cowards whose victory rested not on feat of arms, but the murder of woman and children.]<br>
Posted by John LiuAs at 11:51 PM on March 13</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t you that same nutcase calling himself Joh Lieu a couple of years ago, who claimed to be a Chinese married to a White female&hellip; constantly ranting about perceived thefts of Chinese artifacts, etc. by the British? </p>
<p>What baffles me is that anyone, even an Asian can spout such rubbish as in your current post. Cowardly American soldiers? You either have to be on drugs or drunk to believe that bit of nonsense. Atomic bombings an act of terrorism? Give me a break! </p>
<p>Japan couldn&rsquo;t come to terms with the reality of having LOST the war by 1944. Burning city after city to the ground in Japan wouldn&rsquo;t bring them to reality. The Jap fanatics were teaching women and children to fight with sharpened bamboo poles   &mdash;   if the invasion by Allied forces. Jap fanatics would fight to the death on islands taken by Americans and their allies. So the nuclear bombings made eminent sense.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;ll tell us the atrocities by Japs against civilians were just wartime propaganda. Are YOU personally really that bereft of your senses to BELIEVE the trash you&rsquo;ve posted?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have invited you to talk to my father   &mdash;   who WITNESSED what some of what Japs had done. Except my father passed away years ago. The rubbish you have the gall to post is an INSULT to every honorable American who fought in WWII and to their memory.</p>
<p>Regards the nuclear bomb drops, my only regret is they weren&rsquo;t dropped two years earlier&hellip; and ten or twenty times more numerous.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But communists do not support the cold-blooded executions of hundreds of thousands of completely innocent civilians in order to accomplish a military objective. My father had a life-long hatred of the Japanese, but he never cheered the atomic bombings.&#8221; John LiuA</p>
<p>  On the contrary, the communists had no moral qualms about murdering innocent civilians (Stalin murdered millions in the Gulag and Mao either shot or starved millions), but lacked the military technology (atomic bomb) to do it. Neither Stalin nor Mao had much of a strategic bomber force. Nevertheless, Millions of civilians were killed by the Red Army in the &#8220;liberation&#8221; of Eastern Europe from the Nazis. I think Mao, outside of Tibet, more or less restricted himself to slaughtering his own defenseless people. </p>

			<p><i>Regards the nuclear bomb drops, my only regret is they weren&rsquo;t dropped two years earlier&hellip; and ten or twenty times more numerous.</i></p>
<p>No one disbelieves the terrible atrocities of the Japanese invaders. But that is not justification enough for atrocities against their civilian population.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Koreans suffered terribly under Japanese occupation. In fact for the Chinese, Japanese aggression started in the late 19th Century, when Japan banded with a host of Western nations, to carve up China. When Germany lost WWI the allies handed German possessions in China over to the Japanese.</p>
<p>The West was complicit in Japan&rsquo;s crimes against China, indeed was an accomplice right up until at least the mid 1930s</p>
<p>The Chinese hate the Japanese even now for their atrocities, which they still, unlike the Germans refuse to admit.</p>
<p>But incinerating hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians is another story altogether.</p>
<p>The morality of the atomic weapons is the morality of Genghis Khan, a victory based on terrifying the civilian population into surrender. There is absolutely no moral difference between those atomic weapons and Saddam&rsquo;s slaughter of the Kurds - in fact Saddam had more reason to slaughter the Kurds, who were often collaborating with Iran, on his own doorstep, than America had for the atomic bombings.</p>
<p>The bombings were not tit for tat, as was the case between Britain and Germany. Japan posed absolutely no threat to the civilian population of the United States, and was basically incapacitated at this stage of the war. The real rationale for the bombings was of course political - to put an end to the war and thus quickly halt Soviet military operations in the Far East.</p>
<p>As a side note, the Chinese communists never taught hatred of the Japanese people as a race. It was all about fighting the Japanese &#8216;fascists&rsquo; - a simplistic notion to be sure, but one which did prevent mass atrocities being carried out against the Japanese civilian population in the North East at the end of the war.</p>
<p>In fact Japanese orphaned children, the children of Japanese military and civilian administrative personnel in the occupied areas, were adopted out to Chinese peasant families who raised these children as their own. If the war had been racialized, the outcome would have been far different - as has been seen by countless examples the world over.</p>

<p><i>Cowardly American soldiers?</i><br>
Killing the mothers, wives and children of one&rsquo;s military opponent in order to achieve victory, rather than going head-to-head in a real shooting war is in my definition cowardice. Sure, no one doubts it is an effective way to achieve victory. But it is cowardly, and when America&rsquo;s opponents do same they are so labelled, rightly so, by Americans.  </p>
<p>Not a few military leaders held similar views:</p>

			<p>Some critical voices on the atomic bombings:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my opinion that the use of the barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan &hellip; The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons &hellip; My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.&#8221; Admiral Willian D. Leahy<br>
<a href="http://www.doug-long.com/leahy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.doug-long.com/leahy.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to hit them with that awful thing &hellip; I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon,&#8221; Dwight D Eisenhower<br>
 </p>
<p>&#8220;every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man.&#8221; Pope Pius XII<br>
 </p>
<p>&#8220;If the Germans had dropped atomic bombs on cities instead of us, we would have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime, and we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at Nuremberg and hanged them.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Throughout the war, the Japanese rulers demonstrated that they did not care about the lives of their soldiers.  On Saipan and Okinama, the Japanese Army proved that they had no concern for their own civilians either.  In the home islands they were training civilians to make suicide attacks on American forces.  Why should one more American 18 year boy old die in order to spare the life of a Japanese girl, when the girl was scheduled to die by the orders of her own country&rsquo;s Army?  I would hate to be the one who had to kill a Japanese girl in order to save an American&rsquo;s life, but the hard logic is that she was probably going to die anyway.  The A-bombs were brutal, but not pointless, and no more immoral than any other bombing or shelling.  A person killed by instant incineration or radiation poisoning is no deader than a person killed by bullets or TNT.  <br>
     An accusation that American soldiers were cowards because their President dropped the A-bomb, something the troops had never heard of, is proof of the accuser&rsquo;s irrationality.  You might as well say a cop was a coward because instead of arresting a violent drunk, he stood by and allowed a meteor to fall on the man.  The soldiers had no knowledge of and no say in the matter.  By the way, did American soldiers and Marines not go head-to-head against Japanese forces in a real shooting war on Bataan and Guadalcanal and Tarawa and Peleliu and New Britain and Saipan and Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and dozens of other places?  I suppose it&rsquo;s easy for some kid at a computer to call actual fighting men cowards.  After all, the heroes in video games never flinch from danger, do they?  <br>
     There were a different views on the bomb by military men, picking out the names of those who disapproved shows only that there was diversity of opinion.  There were civilian analysts who thought it was the most humane way to end the war, both because the Japanese Army was determined to fight to the end regardless of casualties, and because the destruction of the transportation networks, rail and costal shipping, made famine inevitable.  It&rsquo;s not a question that can be resolved by quoting a few men of high military rank, or a physicist who has no more knowledge of political and military matters than any other literate person.<br>
     If people want to address the topic at a higher level than barroom discussion, or university classroom discussion, there are a number of good books.  Tennozan, by George Feifer and Downfall by Richard B. Frank are a couple published in the last decade, using more recent research.  </p>

			<p>To John Liu:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese tied down the bulk of Japan&rsquo;s army and were fighting Japan for more then half a decade before America entered the war&#8221;..</p>
<p>This is disingenuous at best. The Chinese were fighting ONLY because the Japanese had invaded their country. </p>
<p> Your other reamark about not recognizing the distinctions between Japan and its wartime leadership as with Germany to the Nazis ignores the fact that the Japanese leadership was largely a reflection of Japan&rsquo;s cultural realities at that time. There was never a peace movement in Japan, no &#8220;July 20th&#8221; bomb plot etc. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with most of your other commentary. Personally I wish America had NOT fought Japan, a war from which America gained nothing and which might have been avoided if the USA had not foolishly expanded deep into the Pacific after 1898. Had America contained itself on the west coast of its national territory war with Japan might have been avoided as easily as war between Japan and Mexico. </p>

			<p>The decision to drop two atomic bombs on Japana was based upon the informaton available to US war planners back in 1945. So even if the historical revisionist are correct there arguments and facts are completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>But it is far from obvious  that the A-bomb revisionists got their facts right.</p>
<p>Revisionst now claim that newly discovered internal Japanese  documents from the time show that the Japanese war planners decided to surrender not because of the dropping of two A-bombs on Japan, but rather, because of Stalin&rsquo;s decision to enter the war against  Japan.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that the revisionist&rsquo;s new argument against the dropping of the A-bomb on Japanese cities depends on the interpretation of one page in the Japanese archive. Not all historians who have examined this one page agree with the revisionists interpretation of this one page.</p>
<p>If the dropping of the atomic bomb was tactically and morally wrong, so was the fire bombing of Japanese cities. Well. the war did end in four years, it hard to believe that the war would have ended sooner if the US hadn&rsquo;t fire bombed Japanese.</p>
<p>Suppose America had twenty A bombs at the start of WW2. Would America been justified in dropping these A-bombs on ten Japanese cities and ten German cities? From the point of view of America obviously yes. IF a case could be made based upon the available evidence at the time that dropping all these A bombs would significantly shorten the war, then it would be justifiable.</p>
<p>I want to point out that I admire the Japanese. They are a highly inquisitive society. WE could learn a thing or two from the Japanese. The Japanese won&rsquo;t foolishly destroy themselves by importing hispanics,hindus,muslims and Hmong. </p>

			<p>War is a competition not of logic or morality, but of destruction. </p>
<p>Discussions of what &#8220;should&#8221; have happened inevitably occur after the fury and desperation that commanded events in war have passed - academically interesting but historically irrelevant.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Not a few military leaders held similar views:<br>
And yes, I am the John Liu you remember.</p>
<p>And still spreading the same tired lies and worthless half-truths, I see.</p>
<p>Whether your father approved or disapproved of the nuclear bombings is irrelevant. What DOES COUNT is that undoubtedly many American lives were spared by not having to stage a massive land-invasion of the home islands. A feeling a lot of decent human beings who survived the war would concur with.</p>
<p>Amazing how Chinese can shed crocodile tears over two cities being bombed, while ignoring the innumerable atrocities Japan committed against Chinese people. But as you recall, YOU were lying through your teeth about perceived exploitation of China by the British and other White nations in your earlier rants. So, Mr. Lieu, don&rsquo;t expect any readers to put much faith in your credibility. Which is rock bottom with anyone having even a modicum knowledge of history.<br>

			<p>What our Asian posters can&rsquo;t seem to grasp&hellip; the psychologicla differences between Whites and Orientals. That White Americans/Euopeans do not subscribe to the suicide culture permeating Japan&rsquo;s military prior to 1945. That Whites see little honor, much less SENSE in a bloody combat to the death. That defeating your enemy using your best weapons to render him (Japan) prostrate and destroy his ability to continue a losing fight&hellip; was far more rational than worrying about &#8220;honor&#8221; or &#8220;face.&#8221;</p>
<p>American strategic policy was to deprive Japan of the ability to continue fighting by destroying its industrial/manufacturing base, depriving Japan of fuel, raw materials&hellip; which was carried out by systematic destruction of Japanese cities in parallel with the sinking of all possible Japanese vessels.</p>
<p>Japan refused to surrender while yet fully aware of the folly of continued combat. Dropping nuclear weapons was intended to both destroy Japan&rsquo;s morale, and to send an unmistakeble message what continued combat would mean to Japan and its people. Result being that after Nagasaki, Japan agreed to surrender.</p>
<p>The rest is history, as the saying goes. Whether ten thousand or two million Allied casualties were avoided is something we will never know. Claiming Russia&rsquo;s entry into the war against Japan precipitated surrender is at best a meaningless statement. Japan having lost two cities to an incredibly potent new weapon resulted in total surrender. Japan having no way of determining whether such atomic bombings would continue or not.</p>
<p>What the apologists and/or outright fools cannot bring themselves to admit is: Had there been no Pearl Harbor, there would have been neither a Hiroshima nor a Nagasaki apocalypse.</p>
<p>Had the Japanese fanatic high command been willing to surrender when perceiving victory was forever impossible, untold bloodshed on BOTH sides could have been avoided. So let&rsquo;s drop all the meaningless hyperbole about using nuclear weapons. They were used. The war was ended. End of story!</p>

			<p>A question:<br>
If the situation was a war exhibition involving Germany and pictures are shown of Dresden and Hamburg after their respective bombings - and displayed in an almost exultant fashion, would the majority of posters here not object to this? Be honest here.</p>
<p>If so why should the feelings of Japanese not be respected in the same way as Germans?</p>
