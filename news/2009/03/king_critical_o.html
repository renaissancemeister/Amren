<h1>King Critical of Spending for &#8216;Pro-Amnesty Organization&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Hancock, Iowa Independent, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A $950,000 earmark for a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the omnibus spending bill that passed the U.S. House Wednesday has drawn the ire of U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Kiron.</p>
<p>The Iowa Republican called the National Council of La Raza a &#8220;pro-amnesty organization&#8221; and said &#8220;the last thing Congress should be doing is handing out cash to apologists for immigration law breakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;American taxpayers do not support La Raza&rsquo;s agenda or its position in support of amnesty for illegal aliens,&#8221; King said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>La Raza points out that any federal money it receives for housing and community development projects is directed to its subsidiary, the Raza Development Fund. That organization&rsquo;s job is to bring private capital and development assistance to local organizations serving Latino families in areas such as affordable housing, primary health care and educational facilities. No money from earmarks goes to advance La Raza&rsquo;s public policy efforts on immigration.</p>

<p>Yeahbut&hellip;this frees up privately raised money to use for political lobbying.  It&rsquo;s called a fungible contribution.  It happens with the NAACP all the time.  It&rsquo;s the functional equivalent of a political contribution.</p>

		<p>Whatever moolah the La Raziststs give to their so called development fund will free up more of it to fund their open borders reconquista efforts. Who cares if they break The White Mans law?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s just one example of what I mean when I write that this country is dysfunctional.  </p>
<p>Only a nation on the way out will ever reach a point where it provides financial assistance to contentious groups whose agenda is at odds with the betterment of this country.</p>
<p>Acorn is another. How many other black groups and non-white groups are funded with majority white tax doillars?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading more and more people expressing desires to see this nation collapse because of the economic calamity, and the frustration is understandable, because those wise enough to understand know full well we&rsquo;re slowly sinking anyway.</p>
<p>A fast bankruptcy will leave the ethno-centric seditionists  fighting for bare survival, which they probably won&rsquo;t win.</p>

		<p>La Raza, an anti-American organization, is determined to make the US into that terrorist country to our south. With the killings, kidnappings and beheading, they are no different from the terrorist countries of the Middle East. Our government has failed to protect us from these criminals. They are so busy dooming our great-grandchildren to the debt they are incurring, they don&rsquo;t have the time to protect us. This insanity has come to our nation and we have no one in Washington who cares. If they did, we&rsquo;d hear about it. Not one word from Obama about the carnage. We&rsquo;re on our own.</p>

		<p>How can this be stopped?</p>
<p>I was following a PT Cruiser on the highway this afternoon.  I was shocked to see trash being thrown out the windows.  A soda can, burger wrappers, napkins.  I pulled up and road next to it to see WHO it was blatantly trashing the environment.  It was a mexican woman and her two brats and when she saw me looking straight at her, it did not even phase her.  If looks coulda killed, she&rsquo;d be lyin&rsquo; deader &#8216;n a doornail!</p>

<p> - La Raza&rsquo;s agenda is &#8220;Reconquista&#8221;.  Their agenda is to take the Southwest part of the United States back and reclaim it for Mexico in the form of a new Mexican nation -Atzlan.  That is much more than merely &#8220;at odds&#8221; with our betterment.  It is a racist organization.  It is also a subversive organization; the Hispanic equivalent of the Communist Party with a big, big difference - La Raza&rsquo;s kind are invading this country at more than a million per year.  Imagine if - in the 1950&rsquo;s - a million Communists were coming into this country ILLEGALLY - AND - Presidential Candidates like Obama, Hillary, and McCain were making speeches at gatherings of Communists like all of the above did before La Raza last year - imagine.  Who could conceive of such a thing.  Yes, we&rsquo;d better wake up soon or we&rsquo;re done.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Raza Development Fund&#8221; is of course the &#8220;[Hispanic] Race Development Fund&#8221;.  How much of the stimulus bill is going to a White Race Development Fund?  And of course any taxpayer dollars going to &#8220;develop&#8221; the Hispanic race is money freed up to lobby for illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>Sure, thats fine right after 10 times that goes to a foundation dedicated to helping white families - after all, that would match the source of the tax dollars more closely.<br>

		<p>Carolinayankee&hellip; this goes on in our Houston, TX area, non-stop! Mexican people are TRASH! Sorry, there really is no other way to accurately describe Mexicans. The pigs on our street&hellip; (used) sanitary napkins spilling out of trash bags, the people too indifferent to even tie the bags&hellip; beer cans, garbage everywhere. We never had rats in our neighborhood before we &#8220;got integrated&#8221;, with eight Mexican families moving to our street. Yet if you say anything, &#8220;you&rsquo;re prejudiced against Hispanic people.&#8221; Ditto, should you complain about dozens of brown brats wrecking YOUR lawn and flowerbeds.</p>

		<p>So they hate whites and our country, but need us to pay for their agenda against us.  Do you think Amren can get a stimulus or not because we&rsquo;re a &#8220;hate group&#8221; since we&rsquo;re a white organization?</p>

		<p>Acorn received multiple millions in extra funding too. As part of the 700 billion dollar bailout plan. Acorn being one of the groups that lobbied heavily to ensure people of color, who didn&rsquo;t qualify, were getting loans ahead of whites who did. </p>

<p>It should certainly be illegal.  Public monies should go to organizations that are for all citizens, without discrimination or preference.<br>
Can you imagine if the shoe was on the other foot and this money was allocated for whites exclusively?<br>

		<p>More Federal money(taxpayer money, the government has no money of its own)for a racist ethnic interest group means more treason against the citizenry by the federal government. La Raza is not a civil rights group for citizens but a fifth columnist group that has an agenda the citizens do not agree with, as Steve Levy has pointed out. </p>
