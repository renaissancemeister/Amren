<h1>Racial Wounds Resurface in Detroit Election Year</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, AP, March 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cobo convention center, one of the many aging buildings downtown, is threatening to become the latest tinderbox in resurgent racial hostilities between the mostly black city and its predominantly white suburbs.</p>
<p>With calls for self-determination in how the venue operates, members of Detroit&rsquo;s embattled City Council have reopened wounds more than four decades old. That&rsquo;s led to stinging newspaper editorials, daily radio commentary and Web site blogs accusing City Council President Monica Conyers of perpetuating the area&rsquo;s negative racial attitudes and stereotypes.</p>
<p>And according to two other council members, all for the sake of votes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The minute you get to an election year, all bets are off on what the outcome of any high-profile controversial issue or action will be,&#8221; said Sheila Cockrel, the lone white on the eight-member board.</p>
<p>At issue is a state plan to turn over the city-owned Cobo to a regional authority, which would include one representative each from Detroit, the governor&rsquo;s office and Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties. The deal would mean a $288 million expansion of Cobo and also would relieve the financially struggling city of about $15 million in annual subsidies.</p>
<p>Last week, Conyers, who is black, told a white Teamsters&rsquo; union official during a contentious meeting on whether to accept the deal that most of the people who work at Cobo during the annual North American International Auto Show &#8220;don&rsquo;t look like me. They look like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The council&rsquo;s action elicited an angry response from one of the deal&rsquo;s backers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every spring the swallows come back to Capistrano. The buzzards come back to Hinckley, Ohio, and every election in Detroit, whoever is running for office, is going to play the race card and beat up whitey in the suburbs,&#8221; Republican Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson, who is white, told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conyers said she wasn&rsquo;t race-baiting. &#8220;Everybody&rsquo;s played the race card but me. I&rsquo;ve not said anything about race,&#8221; she said Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But pushed by Conyers, the council voted 5-3 to nix the transfer plan. Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr. vetoed the council vote Wednesday. His frequent nemesis, Conyers, said Thursday evening that the council&rsquo;s research and analysis director will file a court injunction as early as Monday to stop the veto.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that was racist,&#8221; Conyers insisted during a break in Tuesday&rsquo;s council meeting. &#8220;When I go to Cobo Hall and they&rsquo;re working, that&rsquo;s what I see, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s racist by telling the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind the rhetoric are political futures that begin with an Aug. 4 nonpartisan primary.</p>
<p>More than 300 people have picked up petitions to run for nine council seats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The council has been out of favor with the community for a number of years,&#8221; said councilman Kwame Kenyatta, who along with Sheila Cockrel cast two of the three votes opposing Conyers&rsquo; push to end the Cobo deal.</p>
<p>A proponent of black self-determination, Kenyatta believes Conyers&rsquo; statement was intended to find favor with disenchanted voters.</p>

As Mr. Taylor noted years ago, what we&rsquo;re going to increasingly see played out are racial and ethnic confrontations springing up wherever we find diversity and governments diverting money and resources to prevent conflicts from escalating to out-and-out racial and ethnic battles. </p>
<p>Who knows, we may soon see UN Peace Keepers stationed in American cities.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But pushed by Conyers, the council voted 5-3 to nix the transfer plan.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Of course they did. Blacks want to do things their way even when it means styfling any and every initative that would improve any aspect of their community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling that when you leave whites alone, white communties thrive. When you leave blacks alone, communities regress and die. &#8220;Better to rule in Hell&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>And will this Teamsters official continue to endorse candidates from the Black (Democrat) Party?  Did vote Obama last year?  This is why I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for him too much, he bought that slur on himself.</p>

			<p>Glad I don&rsquo;t live in Detroit anymore.  I remember, when I was a child, my parents complaining about Coleman Young&hellip;and we lived in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Detroit used to be a beautiful city, too, according to my dad.</p>

			<p>Are the Detroit city council and President Conyers more incompetent and irresponsible than the U.S. Congress, and its leaders, Pelosi and Reid? At least the council has an interest in the welfare of Blacks in Detroit. It may be short range, but compare the council&rsquo;s actions to the actions of Congress. Congress is unwilling to control America&rsquo;s borders; Congress regards  law abiding citizens as livestock to be used to advance its NWO agenda; in economic and geopolitical matters, Congress looks ahead no further than the next election. The Detroit council is, at worst, no more dysfunctional than the U.S. Congress.</p>

			<p>Monica Conyers is just terrible.  She&rsquo;s dumb as a rock, nasty, racist, power-hungry, selfish, and has no idea how to interact with people respectfully.  Even with such loathsome political contemporaries, she stands out as the absolute worse.</p>

<p>So true. One can see that in a lot of heavily black populated cities, like Augusta Ga. What blacks can&rsquo;t stand is whitey in control where lots of black people live -the story of South Africa&rsquo;s downfall - no matter the suffering resulting to blacks.</p>

			<p>A previous post by another AmRen contributor included a YouTube link to a video of Council President Conyers calling a colleague on the Council &#8220;Shrek.&#8221; </p>
<p>Having watched that video, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to find a word in the English language that accurately communicates how despicable and immature this woman appears to be. </p>
<p>Be that as it may, I again put to the average white person the question, &#8220;Why perpetuate the folly of these racial games?&#8221;</p>
<p>So black people like Monica Conyers want people that &#8220;look like her&#8221; to find favor in the awarding of a labor contract. Fine, so be it. Let her create something from nothing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, why don&rsquo;t the other municipal entities take their planned $288 million in expansion monies and invest it instead in the construction of a separate convention center in one of their own jursidictions?</p>
<p>Surely a large percentage of commercial exhibition business would gladly - albeit quietly - patronize a convention center far from the crime-ridden epicenter of Ms. Conyers&rsquo; racial fiefdom. </p>
<p>In addition, why not take a page from the Sharpton / Jackson playbook and &#8220;boycott&#8221; the Cobo convention center based on the patently racist, anti-white response Ms. Conyers gave to the Teamsters official? </p>
<p>I side with Question Diversity though, in the sense that most whites will show little backbone against blacks in situations such as this. </p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;d really like to know is why the Teamsters representative didn&rsquo;t just pack up his briefcase and leave the minute those words left her mouth&hellip;.. </p>

			<p>I am all in favor of blacks having their own cities and institutions, because that keeps them away from me and mine, and I can better argue that other things can therefore be controlled by whites.</p>

			<p>Monica Conyers may not be a credit to her race.<br>
But she&rsquo;s certainly representative.</p>

			<p>Why would ANY White person want to hold a political office in Detroit to begin with? A city that is so hopelessly ruined by Blacks, within and without what passes for government, you might as well write the city off entirely.</p>
