<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Next up in our exclusive series of interviews with the cast of Robin Hood, we&rsquo;re meeting a brand new character. Very important in the traditional tales but hitherto unseen in the BBC version, Friar Brother Tuck arrives at the start of episode one to rescue a down-and-out Robin.</p>
<p>[Watch] our chat with David Harewood (he of the excellent Criminal Justice)  &mdash;  and you&rsquo;ll note that he&rsquo;s rather more subdued than in his cameo appearance in yesterday&rsquo;s video!</p>

In this short blurb, we get TWO EXCLAMATION POINTS!! Are YOU as excited as the reporter?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Friar Brother Tuck arrives at the start of episode one to rescue a down-and-out Robin.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In the original, the word Friar has a line through it. I assume his name is changed from Friar Tuck to Brother Tuck.</p>
<p>While I haven&rsquo;t seen the episode and I don&rsquo;t plan to seek it out, from the sentence I quoted above, it seems we have the new paradigm of the black man coming to the aid of a down-and-out white man.</p>
<p>More re-writing of white literature to make the black man seen as relevant and indispensable to the hapless white man.</p>

			<p>This &#8220;blackening&#8221; of literary characters seems to be a burgeoning trend in British television. PBS is currently airing productions of Dickens classics. We find in this latest television adaptation of <em>Little Dorrit</em> the character called Tattycoram played by black actress, Freema Agyeman. Tattycoram in the original novel by Dickens was never meant to be black. Downtrodden, yes, but not black. Another example of this liberal blackening is in a recent production of <em>Oliver Twist</em>, which, too, aired on PBS. The character Nancy is played by another black, British actress, Sophie Okonedo. Again, this character was never meant to be black. </p>
<p>It seems like a small thing to &#8220;blacken&#8221; a minor character here and there, but what will be the perception if major characters from literature suffer the same editorial fate? Or what will happen if historical figures are likewise blackened? Can we fathom a biopic of Eisenhower starring Will Smith as Ike, or LL Cool J starring in the remake of Patton?  </p>

			<p>This is almost as bad as the Robin Hood movie that came out a while back with Kevin Cosner(sp?) in it.  The most intelligent person in the movie was a character played by Morgan Freeman who followed Robin Hood around in a turbin and who constantly told him about the superiority and higher intelligence of his people back home in the Muslim world.  It is funny but I don&rsquo;t ever recall that character in any of the earlier versions of Robin Hood.</p>

			<p>A few years ago Jump the Shark was a popular site. Viewers of television shows would vote on changes in TV programs that signaled their inevitable decline. Various categories were used in the voting: Ted McGinley (sp?), a wedding, new child character, etc. One contemporary category that would certainly fit the Jump the Shark theme would be the appearance of the first nonwhite character. </p>

			<p>My guess is that the incredibly gullible English Whites under 30 have been properly conditioned to accept the possibility that Friar Tuck was Black.  The film &#8220;Robin Hood, Prince of Theives&#8221; began the chipping away at credibility process in the 1990s with a Muslim member in England like anyone&rsquo;s business.  I am just waiting to see how far Whites in England and elsewhere are going to allow non-Whites to re-invent their own history and legends.  I suppose soon we will have a Black Bunhilda in a version of The Ring of the Nibelungen? But back in the 1980s, it became popular for Blacks to appear regularly as main characters in Shakepeare plays.  Little did anyone think then that this would precede the destruction of White society and the race, but I thought it then, and I think it now - and the process is well along.</p>

Oh where would us whites be without the wise counsel given to us from the people of Africa.<br/>
I only hope the producers remain consistent in the casting for this modernised version of this classic English fable.<br/>

<p>Hahahahaha.  Will the comedy never end?</p>
<p>Absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>Of all the major countries in the world Britain is most apt to completely collapse into bankruptcy with all the attendant chaos that goes with it, and yet they bravely continue on with their revisionst lies, still trying to fool the public.</p>
<p>This is Nero fiddling all over again while Rome burns, only this time the disaster looming is much greater than mere fire.  It is the underpinnings of societal stability, yet the thought police are hard at work as if this whole affair is business as usual.</p>
<p>Absolutely hilarious.<br/>

			<p>Why just change his race, which is historically impossible and totally absurd?</p>
<p>As long as fantasy prevails to this degree, why not go all the way and change his religion, also?</p>
<p>He could be Ayatolah Tuck, or Paramahansa Brahmanuja Tuck.</p>
<p>At any rate, I am betting he will &#8220;rescue a down-and-out Robin&#8221; with some sort of sacred African wisdom.</p>

			<p>Ah, so a black man was a member of Robin Hood&rsquo;s band of merry men? I thought the races were so segregated in the past, blacks were put upon, disenfranchised and excluded. Obviously that wasn&rsquo;t true. Here we have an example of black inclusion into white activities way back in the days of yore. So obviously we were lied to all these years about black exclusion and oppression! Glad to see the British MSM is finally admitting it! Now where&rsquo;s the apology for all that liberal guilt-mongering? Next time someone starts blathering on about white segregation, I&rsquo;ll say, &#8220;That&rsquo;s not true. Blacks have always been a part of white activities. Don&rsquo;t you know a black was in Robin Hood&rsquo;s posse? Now we just need to rewrite the Jesus story&hellip;</p>

<p>All kidding aside, it just keeps going, doesn&rsquo;t it?  I&rsquo;ll be willing to bet that Brother Tuck has his man&rsquo;s back!  He&rsquo;ll probably also be shown keepin&rsquo; it real, with his character being smarter than dumb ol&rsquo; Robin. I shudder to think if they&rsquo;re going have Brother Tuck keepin&rsquo; it on the down low with Robin. </p>

			<p>This &ldquo;blackening&rdquo; of literary characters&hellip;Richard at 6:16 PM on March 30</p>
<p>To add to your observations, in other examples where Blacks can play Whites of prominence in great works of literature on stage, movies and TV, I have seen a Black King Henry IV (Shakesphere), a Black Lady of the Lake (King Arthur), a Black twin brother (Shakesphere&rsquo;s Comedy of Errors, the other biological twin brother played by a White actor), a Black sister (3 Sisters by Anton Checkov, the other 2 biological sisters were played by White actresses), a Black Boramere (the warrior prince in Lord of the Rings who is described in the original book as being fair). That&rsquo;s just off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Naturally, no White is allowed to play the leading role in dramatizations of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Mohamed Ali, Louis Armstrong and others. No whites can play Blacks in Afro-centric stories such as Color Purple or Raisins in the Sun.</p>
<p>What media is telling us is Blacks can be Whites, Blacks are equivalent to Whites, or Blacks and just as good as Whites but Whites cannot possibly fill the role of Blacks.</p>
<p>If the argument is put forth that the arts community is merely being color blind, then why are there absolutely no White actors who have played roles traditionally held by Blacks.</p>
<p>Hey lefty artsy-types, why the double standard?</p>

			<p>This &#8220;blackening&#8221; of English classics is a quite deliberate policy. Just as Stalin had inconvenient people airbrushed out of photographs for ideological purposes, our elites are airbrushing, so to speak, certain ethnic groups into our history and culture, in order to create the utterly false impression that a multicultural society has been the historic norm, and not a recent, highly problematic and anomalous exception.</p>
<p>This is deeply sinister.</p>

			<p>Does it truly get more ridiculous than this? I LOVE British comedies shown on our local PBS station. Having watched &#8220;LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE&#8221; for many years. They have one token Black, a constable. Not explained is how a Black happens to be in the backwoods of Britain.</p>
<p>For years my wife and I got a kick out of Eastenders. When one of the main characters got into miscegenation with a Black&hellip; that&rsquo;s when we both lost interest. TV is meant to be entertaining&hellip; who really WANTS to be reminded of the seamy side of life&hellip; like miscegenation? I see enough of it in the real world; I sure have zero interest in seeing it portrayed on the telly.</p>

			<p>I liked the Robin of Sherwood from 1983 series. There was also an ethnic character added, Nazir, but it at least made sense. </p>
<p>It was a new character, not present in the original legend, therefore there was no conflict between the traditional and new story rendition. He was a bewitched Saracene brought in the England from the Crusade by a nobleman - black wizard. And after he was freed by the Merry Men from his master&rsquo;s evil influence, he joined them. It was also a nice weaponry contrast of long bows used by Merry Men and Nazir&rsquo;s reflex bow.</p>

<p>Criminal misrepresentation!  Well, it SHOULD be criminal.</p>
<p>Consider the millions of children viewing this who will know no better.  To them, television is everything.  It is the eye through which they see the world.   It is indistinguishable from reality. [As it is to many adults too.]  This will form their world view and their concept of history. </p>
<p>No matter what the school books may say, the image that impresses them most deeply and  which they will remember is what they see on television.  This will stay with them long after the schoolbooks are forgotten.</p>

Yes, I can&rsquo;t remember the names of each of them, but there have been a number of cases in the news where there was a big hullabaloo made when a role that was regarded as &#8220;minority&#8221; was given to a non-minority instead. That was considered quite outrageous. But the other way around is OK.  And not only OK, but clever, artistic, admirable.<br/>

<p>Oh, the one&rsquo;s who originate the term &#8216;historical revisionism&rsquo; are the very ones who have revised history themselves. Liberals are constantly underestimated. Notice, in the 1950&rsquo;s, the reality was, Western medicine, white men, had completely eradicated the disease of Small Pox from the Earth. That reality could cause others to feel bad, however, so a new one had to be invented. No one&rsquo;s feelings should ever be hurt. </p>

Not so long ago, I viewed the film &#8220;Atonement&#8221;, a nice period piece.<br/>
If anyone has seen it, do you remember the beach scene with the British soldiers, and the main characters were making their way across the beach with a black guy (no speaking part) in tow?</p>
<p>The very first thing that crossed my mind was &#8220;What&rsquo;s a black dude doing there?!&#8221;.  Now black dudes may have been at Dunkirk, I don&rsquo;t know (no segregated troops?)  &mdash;  but it was horribly distracting in the film, &#8216;cause it felt like it didn&rsquo;t fit.  It was like they did it on purpose, had to put the stamp of &#8220;diversity&#8221; on it.<br/>
But it really makes you sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>No, your culture, country, and race is so morally and economically bankrupt that anything looks good in comparison.</p>
<p>Blacks on a TV series where they have no historical basis is yet another example of the new White Man&rsquo;s Burden.<br/>

			<p>Yes, the Stalinist revision of Britain&rsquo;s history and legends goes on apace. </p>
<p>I expect that, in two or three years, the next televised remake of the Robin Hood legend will be even more &#8220;inclusive&#8221;, &#8220;relevant&#8221; and &#8220;edgy&#8221;.</p>
<p>I imagine it will feature a Jamaican Robin Hood, a Pakistani as Imam Tuck, a Bangladeshi Will Scarlet and a Somali Little John. <br/>
It will be called &#8220;Robin in da Hood wit&rsquo; his Merry Homies&#8221;, where said homeboys fight the evil white racist, the Sheriff of Nottingham. </p>
<p>What other history, legends and myths will they destroy next? A Sudanese Beowulf? A Sri Lankan Rob Roy? Mohammed the Lionheart? Wazim Shakespeare? Tariq Dickens? Oliver Hussain?<br/>

<p>Uhhh, have you tuned into American television in the past ten years?  Since Obama&rsquo;s election, CNN has two mulatto male newscasters complemented by half a dozen pretty White female reporters every morning.</p>

			<p>Perhaps, I should not be supprised about a black actor playing the Tuck character in the BBC &#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; series, even though there were no blacks in Medievel England.  The film and television industry is historically inaccurate all the time.</p>
<p>In the HBO &#8220;Rome&#8221; series there were cockatiels in the bird cage in the home of one of the characters.  This in a series taking place in ancient Rome, even though cockatiels are native to Australia.</p>
<p>Sorry, all you Fess Parker fans, but the real Daniel Boone did not wear a raccoon skin cap.  The &#8220;Daniel Boone&#8221; TV series, that ran from 1964 to 1970, was so filled with historical inaccuracies, that the Kentucky state legislature condemned it.</p>
<p>If the real Von Trapp family actually did climb the mountain featured at end of &#8220;The Sound of Music&#8221;, they would have gone into Germany!</p>
<p>Unfortunatley, most people will believe everything they see in the movies and on televsion.</p>
<p>I am not sure if Robin Hood even existed.  I do know William Tell, the supposed hero of Switzerland, did not exist, so the apple story is not true.  William Wallace was a real person, but the movie &#8220;Braveheart&#8221;, as well made as it was, has historical inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Always question everything you read, see on TV, and in the movies you go to!</p>

<p>I recently was in Colombia. What a pleasure to view their TV!  Regardless of the racial chaos one sees in the streets, all the faces on TV were attractive white people (just like Mexico, where white is the standard).  PC doesn&rsquo;t exist there!<br/>

That may have been an oversight, but the blacks among the Roman population depicted in HBO&rsquo;s Rome were a deliberate nod to multiculturalism. In the HBO series &#8220;Rome&#8221; ethnically resembled more modern day London than the venerable ancient city of Roma.  <br/>
Moreover, Robin Hood may or may not have really existed but in the traditional story/legend Friar Tuck was never African. </p>
