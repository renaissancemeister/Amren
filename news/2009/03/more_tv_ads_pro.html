<h1>More TV Ads Project Images of Racial Harmony</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Todd Lewan, AP, March 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ever see an inner-city schoolyard filled with white, Asian and black teens shooting hoops? Or middle-aged white and Latino men swigging beer and watching the Super Bowl on their black neighbor&rsquo;s couch? Or Asians and Latinos dancing the night away in a hip-hop club?</p>
<p>All it takes is a television.</p>
<p>Yes, that mesmerizing mass purveyor of aspiration, desire and self-awareness regularly airs commercials these days that show Americans of different races and ethnicities interacting in integrated schools, country clubs, workplaces and homes, bonded by their love of the products they consume.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ads like these are part of a subtle, yet increasingly visible strategy that marketers refer to as &#8220;visual diversity&#8221;  &mdash;  commercials that enable advertisers to connect with wider audiences while conveying a message that corporate America is not just &#8220;in touch,&#8221; racially speaking, but inclusive.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always like this. For much of the past century, &#8220;minorities were either invisible in mainstream media, or handed negative roles that generally had them in a subservient position,&#8221; says Jerome Williams, a professor of advertising and African-American studies at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These &#8220;multiculti&#8221; ads may be evidence of the vitality of assimilation, America&rsquo;s distinctive, master trend. To advertisers, though, they&rsquo;re simply smart business  &mdash;  a recognition of a new cultural mainstream that prizes diversity, a recognition that we are fast approaching a day when the predominant hue in America will no longer be white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going forward, all advertising is going to be multicultural by definition, because in most states, majority ethnic populations will no longer exist,&#8221; says Danny Allen, managing director at SENSIS, an ad agency in Los Angeles that specializes in reaching multicultural audiences through digital and online media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And yet, some critics wonder if depicting America as a racial nirvana today may have an unintended downside  &mdash;  that of airbrushing out of the public consciousness the economic and social chasms that still separate whites, blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p>Even on Madison Avenue, which is generating the inclusive messages, recent studies find few nonwhites in decision-making and creative positions within the advertising industry itself.</p>
<p>Are multiculti ads, then, an accurate barometer of our racial progress, a showcase of our hopes in that direction  &mdash;  or a reminder of how far we still have to go?</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites still hold most of the economic clout in the United States  &mdash;  85.5 percent of the nation&rsquo;s annual buying power of $10 trillion, according to a 2007 study by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia.</p>
<p>In recent years, though, marketers have been revising old assumptions and campaigns in anticipation of profound shifts in the nation&rsquo;s demographics, and in reaction to changes already under way in what the Selig Center describes as &#8220;The Multicultural Economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>They note that:</p>
<p>_African-American buying power has risen from $318 billion in 1990 to $845 billion in 2007  &mdash;  a 166 percent gain. Whites&rsquo; buying power rose 124 percent during that period.</p>
<p>_The combined buying power of African-Americans, Asians and Native Americans was $1.4 trillion in 2007, a gain of 201 percent since 1990. Meanwhile, the economic clout of Latinos rose by 307 percent, to $862 billion, over that span.</p>
<p>_The number of black-owned companies rose 45 percent from 1997 to 2002  &mdash;  4 1/2 times faster than the national average  &mdash;  and their receipts grew slightly faster than all others. Native American-owned businesses increased by 67 percent, Asian firms 24 percent, Latino companies 31 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If current trends continue, demographers say, nonwhites will be in the majority in America by 2042  &mdash;  a prospect not lost on advertisers, says Melanie Shreffler, editor of Marketing to the Emerging Majorities, an industry newsletter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ads may play well now, but Carter [Karl Carter, chief executive of the Atlanta marketing agency GTM Inc. (Guerrilla Tactics Media)]  wonders how long they will be effective  &mdash;  particularly as America &#8220;beiges&#8221; and race becomes less essential to how individuals self-identify. Over the long run, advertisers would do better, he says, to focus on a cultural approach with versatile images and campaigns easily adapted to highly individualized tastes. Put another way: How do hip-hoppers feel? What are the common desires of surfers, or skateboarders, or kayakers?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Advertising has to reflect reality, to some degree,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So, now that the president is African-American, I think companies that were once afraid to put members of multiple ethnic groups in their ads might see a chance here to go ahead and take a risk, or even see it as necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>Four men in suits and ties are eating in a Holiday Inn Express breakfast bar when they see a pretty white woman enter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This 2008 spot is clever not only for its humor, but because it gingerly tests one of several racial boundaries most advertisers are still loath to cross: The presentation of interracial courting or romance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other no-nos?</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many ads depicting multiracial families or biracial couples interacting normally at home, whether having supper or watching a movie. And in ads that depict professional settings, people of color rarely appear in charge  &mdash;  as CEOs, say, giving presentations to their board of directors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One reason that racial distortions persist may be the relatively low numbers of blacks in the $31 billion advertising industry, and a dearth of blacks in positions of power.</p>
<p>A report released in January by the Madison Avenue Project, a coalition of legal, civil rights and ad industry leaders, found dramatic levels of bias in the industry, with African-American professionals lagging in pay, hiring, promotions and assignments.</p>
<p><b>Some findings:</b></p>
<p>_Black college graduates earn 80 cents for every dollar made by their equally qualified, white counterparts, and salaries of $100,000 are disproportionately less likely for African-American managers and professionals.</p>
<p>_Sixteen percent of large advertising firms employ no black managers or professionals; in the overall labor market, 7 percent of companies are without blacks in those positions.</p>
<p>_Blacks are only 62 percent as likely as whites to work in the powerful &#8220;creative&#8221; and &#8220;client contact&#8221; functions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And yet, might today&rsquo;s ads also be implanting false assumptions that our race problems have been fixed, that all Americans are living comfortable, upper-middle-class lifestyles in racially harmonious settings?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were to come down from another planet and watch TV, you&rsquo;d think that all of these human beings share a lot of intimacy, regardless of the way they look,&#8221; Gallagher [Charles Gallagher, chair and professor of the sociology department at La Salle University] says. &#8220;But the reality is, people of different races don&rsquo;t share social space like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 80 percent of whites live in neighborhoods in which 95 percent of their neighbors are also white, and census data shows 90 percent of the neighborhoods that were predominantly or exclusively black in 1990 remained that way a decade later.</p>
<p>&#8220;My students always say to me, &#8216;Isn&rsquo;t it better to have these ads? It&rsquo;s kind of a fake-it-&#8216;til-you-make-it kind of thing,&rsquo;&#8221; Gallagher says. &#8220;The problem with that, I tell them, is that distortions and false impressions never do anyone any good.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Advertising is aspirational,&#8221; [Schreffler] adds. &#8220;It&rsquo;s who we want to be, a lifestyle we want  &mdash;  not always who we are.&#8221;<br>

Confirmation of what we&rsquo;ve long known.</p>
<p>While much of this is done to deliberately put a positive perspective on interracial interactions, Mad Ave needs to push the envelope to get attention. They are ads out there that show ambiguous relationships between black men and white women (are they a couple or just sitting in close proximity?). Soon, it&rsquo;s going to be front and center.<br>

			<p> Yes, these corporate advertisers are &#8220;faking it,&#8221; pretending that this is just one big, happy national family, instead of acknowledging the ethnic and racial tensions that always accompany a polyglot society   &mdash;   especially one as large as the U.S. Their desire to depict an &#8220;America as it ought to be&#8221; rather than an America as it really is, I believe is the real reason for the multi-culti commercials   &mdash;   not a belief that this is the most effective way to sell the product.</p>
<p> But I also believe that TV commercials nowadays aren&rsquo;t nearly as &#8220;integrated&#8221; as this AP article would like us to believe. For instance: Notice how the ads almost always depict a &#8220;warm, loving family&#8221; as black   &mdash;   despite the 70 percent illegitimacy rate among blacks. The black father, especially, is always played by an actor who is tall, well-built and handsome.</p>
<p> A White father, on the other hand, is likely to be portrayed by an actor who is chubby, balding, and acts like a doofus. In fact, that description fits most of the White male actors who appear in TV commercials nowadays   &mdash;   no taller than medium height, overweight, losing their hair, acting as if they&rsquo;re afraid of their wives. That gives away the mindset of those who make the commercials: Yes, they want to sell the product. But on a social level, they also want to help undermine what they view as the dominant position of White males in this society. What better way than making them seem physically unimposing, not very bright, and hen-pecked? </p>

			<p>I have to so agree. I see commercials where black, brown, white an oriental people are together on college campuses, in restuarants, at various events of all kinds, and so on. Now some of these situations might exist in special circumstances, like for instance, company meetings, company outings, occasionally school rallies, and that&rsquo;s about it. The claims of libeal progressives aside, the truth is the truth.  </p>

			<p>Some of these commercials border on the absurd. It&rsquo;s nothing more than the usual multicultural liberal progressive attempt at brainwashing the American public. Now some of these situations might exist at company meetings, a few school rallies, or maybe some company outings, and those are about the only situations in which I have seen black, Chinese, White, Hispanic, Indian, and what have you, people, all playing, congregating, etc. together.</p>

			<p>I am so sick of this garbage. </p>
<p>What kind of fantasy land is this country living in? </p>
<p>I just did a job in NYC with a crew from Paris. The soundman brought me a few magazines : Paris Match, Le Point, Marianne. </p>
<p>Right now the French press is talking alot about the &#8220;unrest&#8221; in their territories in the Caribbean and elsewhere (Guadeloupe, Martinique, La Reunion). They are much more bold than the US press would ever be, though they do still dance around the issue of race rather spinelessly (but nowhere near like here in the US). </p>
<p>But what truly blew me away in these French magazines, and was an incredible breath of fresh air in an  otherwise bleak and depressing week (visiting NYC after reading Amren daily  for two years can be an eye-opening and disturbing experience), was their near total lack of the relentless 24/7 non-stop in-your-face diversity that is force-fed to us over here in advertising. </p>
<p>In ALL of the big ads in Paris Match, for ALL of the big-name French companies like Chanel or Peugeot, the people depicted in the ads are typical Frenchmen, period. NOT the gaggle of opposite racial types perpetually depicted as living side by side in perfect harmony as seen in EVERY SINGLE ADVERTISEMENT featured here in the USA. </p>
<p>I have posted here before about how this same phenomenon - lack of contrived  artificial diversity on tv and in advertising (or should I say instead: &#8220;Accurate portrayal of demographic realities in ads and on tv&#8221;?) - exists on your local Spanish-language cable channel. Last time I watched a movie (the beautiful &#8220;Anita no pierde el tren&#8221;, 2001, set in Spain) on Telemundo, I was SHOCKED to see not a single black face, either in the film itself, or on any of the commercials during the breaks, NOT A SINGLE ONE. </p>
<p>I am so aghast at what is happening in this country that sometimes I can barely think straight: all of the wishful thinking of the social engineers that you see, plain as day, in print or on tv, the dishonesty and untruthfulness of the propaganda simply staggering, that&rsquo;s without even mentioning the MIND BOGGLING fraudulence of this thing in the White House, this invention of the left, a mere seven years after 9/11&hellip;. </p>
<p>Sometimes I want to start planning my emigration out of the US, a lot like the remaining Afrikaners in SA. </p>
<p>Somebody please: suggest something. Something needs to happen and it needs to start happening soon. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the white baby in the E-Trade ad is the one who seems to know the most. More often we see blacks who are the one in charge or the only one with any sense.</p>
<p>Of course they are trying to suggest to people that blacks are just like them, maybe better. But then we hear about the education gap, and how blacks are sent to prison so much more ofter. To the average idiot who these ads target, it must be confusing. On one hand they are being told that blacks are doing well, and on the other they are told that they still need to step back and let a black person ahead of them for a job since blacks still need help to level the field.</p>
<p>That young people see nothing wrong with interracial romance show how successful these sorts of campaigns are. Of course maybe the kids do see it as wrong, but they know that they are never allowed to let anyone know that they think that way.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s like it is in the TV markets of my native St. Louis and my current Cape Girardeau-Carbondale-Paudcah   &mdash;   you&rsquo;ll see TV commercials advertising these fly-by-night &#8220;colleges&#8221; where you learn to be a criminal justice expert in three weeks.  The images you&rsquo;ll see are of black cops arresting white criminals, and of black scientists working in labs, fast forward to white criminal being sent to prison.</p>
<p>On these same channels, the news will almost always (in the case of St. Louis), or on occasion (in the case of Carbondale) have black criminality predominate its first segment, the images you will see are of white cops arresting black criminals.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d also think that all white males were either burglars breaking into someone&rsquo;s house, or else dumb doofuses who have to be educated by some smarter, hipper nonwhite.  If whites really do &#8220;still hold most of the economic clout,&#8221; why do advertisers want to insult us?</p>

<p>No problemo. All any white has to do is is drive through Los Angeles, Detroit, or any other largely black or hispanic area for a strong dose of reality. And of course, there will always be race hustlers like Prof. Jerome Williams to remind whites of how racist they, and only they, have been down through history.</p>
<p><i>Are multiculti ads, then, an accurate barometer of our racial progress, a showcase of our hopes in that direction &mdash; or a reminder of how far we still have to go?</i></p>

<p><i>If current trends continue, demographers say, nonwhites will be in the majority in America by 2042</i></p>
<p>And why are whites are the only ethnic group on earth that should celebrate their own dwindling numbers and influence?</p>

To advertisers, though, they&rsquo;re simply smart business &mdash; a recognition of a new cultural mainstream that prizes diversity, a recognition that we are fast approaching a day when the predominant hue in America will no longer be white.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what if the day never comes, &#8220;when the predominant hue in America will no longer be white?&#8221; </p>
<p>What if the day comes instead, when the &#8220;predominant hue in America&#8221; is back to 90% white, or greater?</p>
<p>It is only shortsighted: greed, stupidity, and arrogance, that guides today&rsquo;s &#8220;advertisers!&#8221;</p>
<p>In their lust for money (and ironically, the protection it might buy them from the &#8220;multiculti&#8221; realities of life,) they foolishly foster a kaleidoscopic fantasy world via the idiot box. In this, we see that their greed and stupidity merges together to produce an arrogance, that reduces them to abject absurdity. </p>
<p>After all, should the &#8220;cultural mainstream&#8221; suddenly change for the better, might not they be fed to the pigs?</p>
<p>That is, if the pigs would have them?<br>

			<p>of course, if you pay close attention, its always the &#8220;stupid white guy&#8221; who screws everything up and gets the pie in the face while the wise minority rolls her eyes and takes advantage of the great product being pitched. Pure fantasy garbage, and its by accident buit by design. Thats the scary part.</p>

			<p>TV commercials are a great source of information about the mental condition of Americans. It&rsquo;s important to consider when analysing commercials, always to note the product being advertised as well as the program and time slot. This will fairly well indicate the demographics of the audience. For example: The commercials, shown in conjunction with auto racing, do not denigrate White men. Commercials shown with soaps for electronic products show White men as unpleasant or ineffectual. </p>

			<p>The most memorable and truly humorous of these types of ads was one I remember from the early eighties, for Bic pens.</p>
<p>The catch-phrase was &#8220;Go with the flow&#8221;. One of the sequences showed three white guys and one black man, all named Thomas and all apparently partners in a legal firm. The camera panned from one to the next, with the black man last. All three white men wore identical horn-rimmed glasses and conservative suits; the black man was in a flashy outfit.</p>
<p>The three white men stated their names in identical monotones while holding up a Bic pen: &#8220;Thomas&#8221;, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;</p>
<p>The camera then pans to the black man: &#8220;And THOM-ASSSS, ARE GOIN&rsquo; WITH THE FLOOOOOW!!!&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It was genuinely hilarious, but probably someone in the NAACP complained. I only saw the ad a couple of times.</p>

Smart buisness? I get angry at the advertizers who depict the false illusion of racial harmony in their ads and I get VERY angry at these same airheads who depict whites as incompetent boobs who need a non white to come to their rescue in their ads. And Mr Advertiser I am putting you on notice that I am a white who refuses to buy your product if you in any way insult my race, heritage or culture. This has been my practice for years. Whites hold more than 85 percent of American consumer buying power. And you expect us to purchase your products after insulting the hell out of us, while praising minorities as our superiors at the same time? No thank you. My money will not be enriching you. And I have a very long memory.</p>

			<p>My father said recently that if you judged America only by looking at TV, you&rsquo;d think 90% of the country was black. I&rsquo;ve also noticed what others have, that every white male on american tv is shown as a big overgrown child, dorky, fat and balding and  too dumb to tie his shoelaces unless a black is showing him how. White females are often shown either as frumpy dorks or as some blonde sexpot whispering seductively at you. Blacks and every other minority however, male or female, are shown as being smart, attractive, capable and upper class in every way and giving whites clear instructions on everything from how to do their taxes or which car to buy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If current trends continue, demographers say, nonwhites will be in the majority in America by 2042 &mdash; &#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big IF. A lot can happen between now and then to totally change things. However, if America does become majority non-white and made up of  various ethnic groups, it will simply cease to exist as it is today. It will be just another 3rd world country in a globalized economy. Madison Ave. advertisers won&rsquo;t have much to advertise because the country will be made up of a small ruling class of elites with widespread poverty and economic depression among the mostly non-white masses.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;My students always say to me, &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better to have these ads? It&rsquo;s kind of a fake-it-&lsquo;til-you-make-it kind of thing,&rsquo;&rdquo; Gallagher says. </p>
<p>As someone else has said, when you have a multiracial society, in any country,there will NEVER be nirvana. This is a multiculuralist fairy tale. The truth is people are racial creatures by nature and different races will automatically self-segregate. Multiracial societies are and will always be fraught with balkenization, discord and self-segragation as well as being much weaker and less unified than racially homogenous countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with that, I tell them, is that distortions and false impressions never do anyone any good.&rdquo;that of airbrushing out of the public consciousness the economic and social chasms that still separate whites, blacks and Latinos.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>First of all, the group of Americans that have the highest annual income is not whites but asian-americans. If America were &#8220;racist&#8221; this would not be. Blacks/Latinos make less money because they are more likely to drop out of school, less likely to go to college despite the fact that they can get government aid easier then whites, are more likely to be single parent families and have kids out of wedlock and they have more kids.<br>

			<p>Actually these ads work in our favor.  They lead to a phenomenon known as &#8220;cognitive dissonance.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s what happens when there&rsquo;s a huge disconnect between fictional beliefs and harsh reality.</p>
<p>The smart black person who solves the &#8220;stupid white guy&rsquo;s&#8221; problem is the fiction shown on TV.  What ordinary people experience on the street, in the store, and in the company office day in and day out is the exact opposite, the facts of daily life if you will.</p>
<p>Eventually something&rsquo;s got to give.  Either the reality of daily life will give way, producing a schizophrenic person who lives in a total imaginary world, or the fiction of TV will be seen for what it is, sheer fiction with no foundation in reality.  A person who figures that out then becomes immune to the propaganda, as most people posting on this site have become.  The sheer contrast between the fiction and fact is thus actually maximized by these shows and commercials.</p>
<p>Still it is annoying to have all that anti-white racism shoved in your face all the time, but there is a remedy:  the on-off button on the remote.  Click off the TV and spend your quality time doing something else.  Or be wise and rent movies and shows online that you know will not have this in-your-face propaganda.</p>

<p>It is not racial harmony but the goofy white guys and the smart black guys that make up the advertising narratives.  Look for future Madison Ave. &amp; Hollywood productions of white girl swept off her feet by cool black guy.  </p>
<p>Race mixing has no sales value.  Whites don&rsquo;t need blacks using products to convince them to buy.  Common sense would tell you white people want to see white people enjoying the product.</p>
<p>Maybe the minorities, who do sense their inferiority, want to see themselves mixed in with white people, but as Attorney General Eric Holder pointed out white people don&rsquo;t want to mix.</p>
<p>Advertising is supposed to sell products, not sell multiculturalism.  Multiculturalism runs against the grain of basic human instincts.  Advertisers are experts at manipulating the unconscious.  Yet there is a universal conformity for this counter productive behavior.  One is forced to conclude that a powerful force is behind the race mixing in advertising and Hollywood productions.  </p>
<p>My adult children express their consternation at my reminders of the non-white take over of America.  Although they don&rsquo;t consider minorities&rsquo; life threatening to our culture, they do see them as drag on it.  After all there is really nothing they can do about.  My sons, the best sons in the world, like the TV show Burn Notice.  I recorded an episode and saw something odd.  In the background of a scene a blond woman and black man walked by together.  A minute later another blond woman and black man heading in the same direction stop and kiss.  Slow motion revealed it was the same couple.  </p>
<p>Nothing is haphazard in commercials or movies.  The writers, directors, and producers carefully stage every foot of film.  Since our aversion to other races is deep in the unconscious the anti-white elites must attack it on that level even more aggressively than on the conscious level.</p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words.  I did get a positive reaction after the kissing revelation.  My sons are now conscious of the anti-white subliminal message sent.  Now if they would only stop watching the NBA.</p>

			<p>A unwritten rule for tv shows and commercials is a black must never ever be portrayed as commiting a crime(the statitics be damned)In fact they are portrayed as police,judges and in general noble people fighting white crime. </p>

			<p>I too have noticed that white men are usually portrayed in commercials as clownish, inept men.  One reason for this is whites are the only racial group not allowed to organize for their own racial self-interest so no one cares if whites are ridiculed.  However, if blacks or latinos or American Indians were habitually presented as losers and clowns in commercials, their civil rights groups would protest and even file suit.  </p>
<p>The other reason for our being poorly depicted is that those who dislike whites are jealous of our accomplishments and annoyed by our perceived status.  They want to denigrate us while simultaneously raising up all other ethnic groups to our former level of dignity.  </p>
<p>Our youth are being subliminally brainwashed that to be a white male in multi-culti America is to be a loser.  Every other group, including white women and children, dominate white males in commercials.  We all know that alpha white males exist, but they are rarely shown in commercials.  Instead, we are habitually shown alpha black males, alpha latina females, alpha every ethnic group, but always an emasculated, goofy white male to provide comic relief.   </p>
<p>One more point:  Isn&rsquo;t something like 70% of all burglaries in America perpetrated by blacks and mestizos?  Yet in all the ads for security services they feel the need to show a white burglar lurking in the bushes, never a black or mestizo.  I am insulted.</p>

Let&rsquo;s put the shoe on the other foot.   </p>
<p>Suppose it were announced that blacks had fallen from 13% of the population to 10%,  and it is further expected in another 40 years that they will be only  5%.</p>
<p>Suppose it were also announced that X% of jobs that were traditionally held by blacks are now held by Hispanics and other immigrants. And that further &#8220;progress&#8221; is expected to continue in this area.</p>
<p>Would blacks be expected to welcome that news and even &#8220;celebrate&#8221; it?</p>

			<p>It is only shortsighted: greed, stupidity, and arrogance, that guides today&rsquo;s &ldquo;advertisers!&rdquo;<br>
In their lust for money (and the protection it might buy them from the &ldquo;multiculti&rdquo; realities of life,) they foolishly foster a kaleidoscopic fantasy world via the idiot box. </p>

<p>That is fantasy!   EVERYTHING will be changed&hellip;. including their positions and their wealth.  Nothing will survive and be the same as it is today.  Somehow, they foolishly think that they can sell out everyone else, but still preserve themselves.   Not likely!</p>

			<p>The absolute worst ads have to be the ones for the alarm and protection companies. Always always whites casing or looking to break into a house. The only saving grace is that I have not seen any with whites looking to break into a house occupied by blacks. The next worst are some dumb ads with a lawyer interviewing his client inside a jail or prison. Care to venture a guess as to the race of his client? Just an aside, has anybody kept score on how many black champs Jeopardy has? This I think really calls for an investigation by that guy Holder.</p>

			<p>Can you spell P-R-O-P-A-G-A-N-D-A?</p>
<p>I mean what else would you call these asinine commercials depicting Black researchers, Black &#8216;experts&rsquo; that seem to have all the answers for their befuddled White associates?</p>
<p>I always get a laugh out of these artificial universes depicted in sitcom-like commercials&hellip; the White families with the obligatory best friends&hellip; who just happen to be Blacks. About as true-to-life as a Mickey Mouse cartoon. By definition, my wife and I are midd-class, White-collar types. A decent income, decent education. Yet neither we, nor ANYONE I know have Blacks for friends.</p>
<p>Why on earth would we choose to socialize with Blacks? Granted we all buy more or less the same consumer products (within our respective financial reach). With that, communality ends. We&rsquo;re WHITE, they&rsquo;re BLACK. No communications. No interest in each other. You might have Black faces at work&hellip; after hours, you go separate ways. Interracial fraternization? Thank you, but NO THANK YOU!</p>
<p>Granted, the youngsters, particularly girls get pressured with the &#8220;am I too Black for you&#8221; garbage. The pigs end up breeding mulatto babies; the sensible ones fend off unwanted advances. So who really would take those ludicrous commercials seriously? An artifical life in an artificial universe. I&rsquo;d venture a guess not even Blacks fall for that unrealistic picture.</p>

Marry or have sex with a Black and the price will be losing your family. FOREVER! The choice is yours. Make the wrong one and be disowned and rejected by us the rest of your life! No turning back, EVER!</p>
<p>Sure it&rsquo;s hard. Call it &#8220;tough love.&#8221; But the only way to make your teenager understand. That too many families are too gutless to take a firm stand is the reason for the many mulatto faces you encounter daily. The grandmother with a mixed-breed child in the supermarket parking lot. The tweny-year old White girl with a mixed-breed brat. Draw your own conclusions. </p>

			<p>The multicult advertisements are a self-fulfilling prophecy.  They program you and your children every time you watch them.  You may think that awareness makes you immune, but it doesn&rsquo;t - bit by tiny bit, they reprogram your brain&rsquo;s definition of normalcy.  The conditioning that is effected by this programming, is a significant contributor to the meek reaction of Whites to being displaced in their own nation.</p>
<p>50 years ago, Whites would not have accepted the conditions we accept in our nation today.  What was different then?  They were not programmed 24/7 to be accepting of multiculturalism.  Their descendants however have bought into the notion that they need to be entertained every moment of the day, and voluntarily inject the programming directly into their consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to throw off the programming, and WAKE UP.  You don&rsquo;t HAVE to watch those good Black / bad White TV dramas, or allow your kids to buy rap music, or purchase products from companies that are forcing miscegenation into your world.  Turn the tables on them - when you see adverts for products that feature traditional White families, buy those products and spread the word to your friends and family.</p>
<p>Most importantly, contact the companies that you champion as well as the ones you boycott, and TELL THEM exactly why you aren&rsquo;t buying their products.  Let&rsquo;s start using that #1 buying power clout to OUR advantage, instead of our opponents.</p>

			<p>On the one hand, I agree with advertisers who want to show things in a positive light, and we do have to get along until such time as we have our own. On the other hand, it is best for whites if they have as little as possible or nothing at all to do with nonwhites, kind of like what the old south was said to be like, simply ignoring then whenever it&rsquo;s possible. At some point you have to do what&rsquo;s best for yourself.  </p>

Then I realized its NOT them pushing this AGENDA it&rsquo;s our own white race that is raising these people up to the level of demigods? WHY is what I would like to know WHY? I for one avoid buying any product advertised using this all black or black with a blonde female, who is always so excited and proud to be with him, mix. They are under 14% of the population and that should be their representation on TV, etc. And the power these muslims seem to exert over our schools and public arena&rsquo;s far exceeds anything a Christian or Jew has ever been able to exert.

That&rsquo;s fine.  But what do you do when they&rsquo;re ALL pushing the same Kool-aide?<br>
Become a hermit? Stop doing laundry and brushing your teeth? Stop eating?</p>

			<p>Throughout my city (population 20,000,) a large number of &#8220;hispanic&#8221; haved moved here in the last twenty years or so. And it&rsquo;s been my observation, that a number of them have satalite dishes mounted to the homes that they live on. </p>
<p>I wonder if MTV is a part of there viewer programing? Probably not.</p>

			<p>How many billions does the Madison Avenue advertising machine squander trying to brainwashing the public into believing in this multicultural/diversity fantasy. Wouldn&rsquo;t portraying the truth be infinitely cheaper and leave the public much more in touch with reality.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Granted, the youngsters, particularly girls get pressured with the &ldquo;am I too Black for you&rdquo; garbage. The pigs end up breeding mulatto babies; the sensible ones fend off unwanted advances.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was working at a nonprofit in DC.  I am a friendly person, and I was friendly to both the administrative/creative staff (99% white), and the menial/security staff (99% black).  One of the younger menial workers (aptly named &#8220;Ebony&#8221;) came into my office one day for no apparent reason.  </p>
<p>We made small talk for a minute, and then she asked me point-blank &#8220;Do you date outside of your race?&#8221;  Apparently this morbidly obese, poorly educated, woman (who repeatedly reminded me that she was a cheerleader at Howard) assumed that as a white man, only my racism would prevent me from dating her.</p>
<p>Unlike some people here, I harbor no ill will toward fully assimilated people of other races.  I described to her a few non-white women that I had dated and made it pretty clear that I was not interested, and it was not because of her race.</p>
<p>Still, the implicit accusation of racism in her question lingers with me when I read and hear the assumption that whites are generally racist.  I suspect that she had made advances on white men before and believed that they had rejected her because of racism.  When blacks are taught from birth that whites are racist, almost every failure they endure can be construed in such a way as to confirm that suspicion.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No matter how you portray blacks, they&rsquo;ll complain.&#8221;</p>
<p>At some point we need to say &#8220;Who cares&#8221;? Do they care about how whites are portrayed or how whites feel or how whites are affected?</p>

			<p>The ad that I really noticed was the plavix ad with the hyper-competent black electrical supervisor instructing the hopeless white workers on how to turn the power back on after an outage. It ends with the magic black guy patting an obseqeous white worker on the shoulder as they watch the lights come back on in the city. Having worked in the power industry, I always had a good laugh at this one.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It goes well beyond that. TV and movies do the same thing and the black-white buddy thing is now a total cliche.&#8221;<br>

<p>WE here at Amren know that;  but many gullible, thoughtless people do not. Naive, impressionable kids are especially susceptible. And they are doubtless the ones being targeted. All they know is what they see on television and they take it for the real world, every word. Many people out there, even many adults, have lost any distinction between reality and TV. </p>
<p>There are literally people who watch TV all day long. It has become their substitute for life.</p>
<p>And consider too that these programs and movies are exported to many other countries. In places like Europe, they think this is the reality of America.  It&rsquo;s &#8220;cool&#8221; to have a black buddy. Everybody should have one.<br>

			<p>The genocide of whites continues apace.  It takes two whites to produce a white child; not so other races with their kind. </p>
<p>Chock this up to the fact that Whites only branched off from the mass of humanity perhaps a mere 50,000 years ago and our genetic differences are in their infancy and relatively fragile. </p>
<p>We left Africa hardly an eyeblink ago  &mdash;  not long enough for us to complete our speciation so that we can no longer have gene flow with the rest of humanity. </p>
<p>Thus, it is relatively easy to wipe us out by loving us to death  &mdash;  literally.  All that has to happen is for whites to have children with non-whites to fulfill the genocidal dreams of madmen who want whites to go extinct.</p>

<p>I know exactly where you are coming from. You are 200% correct when you observe the &#8220;relentless 24/7 non-stop in-your-face diversity that is force-fed to us&hellip;.&#8221;  When I lived in Spain that is one of the things I didn&rsquo;t miss about the USA. When I returned back to America, I felt alienated by the non-stop &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; that was constantly shoved down my throat via entertainment, mass media, and education. At least in Spain I was considered a human being. Here in the US, I am WHITEMALE, enemy of all mankind. </p>
<p>This is the way the new USA is. Hostile Elites want it that way.<br>
It is not your grandfather&rsquo;s country anymore. What is left to defend here? I am no longer patriotic. I want to leave too.</p>

			<p>People are delusional about race w/ IQ and race relations in this country.</p>
<p>I live in a very &#8220;diverse&#8221; area yet rarely see mixed marriages or mixed churches or mixed social functions. Beyond this, every &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; person I&rsquo;ve known has his own pet theory about White people. &ldquo;Minorities&rdquo; almost always have an opinion about race to a degree-seeing people as individuals or themselves as individuals is non-existent. They think about us all the time.</p>
<p>The fact that tens of millions  foreign yet fiercely proud  yellows, browns and blacks are allowed to emigrate to White countries without the masses batting an eye is  probably perplexing and interesting conversation topic for &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; while they are amongst themselves.</p>

			<p>As one brave Anonymous pointed out, &#8220;We all know who runs Madison Avenue&hellip;&#8221;, and they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;white&#8221;.  Why then pretend that selling more material garbage is goal, and that refusing to purchase same will stop their real agenda, ie. Euro-genocide?  If one hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity (or the courage) to read Kevin MacDonald (as but one of many excellent writers on the topic, he is probably that one which is most lucid in his analysis and has the greatest impact), it is high time to become informed. </p>
<p>Perhaps some good might come out of all of this nonetheless - a culling of the more thought-challenged Euro-Americans via their self-chosen down-breeding, and a steeling of the resolve (even if due simply to economic and cultural desperation) of the rest of the tribe. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;minorities were either invisible in mainstream media, or handed negative roles that generally had them in a subservient position,&rdquo; says Jerome Williams, a professor of advertising and African-American studies at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Really so why does every cop show, have a good black cop and a corrupt white one?</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S RIGHT&hellip;I DON&rsquo;T WATCH MUCH TV, BUT IN MY LIMITED VIEWING, I&rsquo;VE SEEN A LOT OF BLACK JUDGES AND DOCTORS AND LAWYERS!&hellip;AND COPS.</p>
<p>A White father, on the other hand, is likely to be portrayed by an actor who is chubby, balding, and acts like a doofus. In fact, that description fits most of the White male actors who appear in TV commercials nowadays  &mdash;  no taller than medium height, overweight, losing their hair, acting as if they&rsquo;re afraid of their wives. </p>
<p>RIGHT AGAIN&hellip;I NOTICE IT HERE IN AUSTRALIA - NOT THE DIVERSITY, BUT THE INEPT WHITE MAN THAT IS BASICALLY HOPELESS AND HAS TO BE CORRECTED BY HIS &#8216;WIFE WITH THE ROLLING EYES&rsquo; <br>
SO US WHITE CHAPS GET IN FROM THE DIVERSITYMONGERS AND THE GIRLPOWERFEMINISTS!<br>

<p>When I was in Spain, I noticed that too and it was one of the things that I liked. Spain was an unabashedly white country (then) and it didn&rsquo;t pretend to be anything else. Such a refreshing change from the USA! I mentioned this to some Spaniards, and they had no notion at all of what I was talking about. They simply couldn&rsquo;t comprehend.</p>
<p>However, that was some years ago. I wonder what it is like now, since Spain has very recently come under the gun as well, and the &#8216;Powers That Be&rsquo; have been vigorously  promoting massive immigration and diversity. Spaniards today must be getting the full blast of multiculti anti-white propaganda.  I think people should forget about running away to some idyllic far-away spot where whites can survive in peace. I fear that there is no corner of the white world that they (the multiculti fanatics) will leave untouched, unreconstructed in the new multi-racial mold. Not even Iceland!</p>

			<p>Movies are just as disgusting with the FALSE PROPAGANDA they project. I simply refuse to patronize the local movie theaters. If I really WANT to see a specific film, I rent it; or better yet, wait till it&rsquo;s shown on the boob tube, FOR FREE!</p>
<p>If enough people make a conscious and deliberate effort to boycott the HOLYWOOD PROPAGANDA MACHINE&hellip; BOYCOTT the companies who&rsquo;s products are shilled by the more obnoxious commercials, we can make them feel it. </p>
<p>Parents need to make a major effort to counter-act the brainwashing their children receive in school. Explaining the difference between the &#8220;real world&#8221; and the fiction of commercials, of movies, and worse, the teaching in school pertaining to racial differences. Don&rsquo;t knock minorities, but slowly over time, explain WHY the schools are foced to make such an effort to try to project a &#8220;positive&#8221; image of Blacks and Hispanics. To make them appear less crime-prone and more civilized than they really are.</p>

<p>I could have laughed at that too.

			<p>We quit watching American TV around 2000. We used to enjoy SF shows, but Jessica Alba in &#8216;Dark Angel&rsquo; ended it for us, and we never looked back. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, we&rsquo;ve been enjoying a lot of Japanese anime, because the drawing style is &#8216;underdrawn&rsquo; - in other words, by suppressing certain racially distinctive characteristics, many (not all) characters look Japanese to the Japanese, and look &#8216;normal&rsquo; to white viewers.</p>
<p>In recent shows there is still a strong preference for straight hair, but tattoos and piercings are for the rough crowd, not the &#8216;good guys.&rsquo; Very few Afro hair appears except for 70s style lampooning. Wiry hair designs often indicate dubious characters.</p>
<p>A good example is the recent show &#8216;Tytania&rsquo; - with very Western European Baroque settings, and most all of the cast are all handsome and clean-cut men and women, young and old. (No &#8216;diversity&rsquo; mandate there!) </p>

for years the white Christian,(what else?) hetero has been portrayed as a moron, while the heroic black guy solves all problems.

<p>Indeed!</p>
<p>Very good points browser!!!</p>
<p>They are so arrogant in their sanctimonious stupidity, that they miss all of the forces and trends of history. Nothing ever really works out according to dictated &#8220;plans;&#8221; normally, only an odd and ironic facsimile is what remains of such &#8220;plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, the potato chip or toy commercials that promote genocide and &#8220;pride&#8221; for these Madison Avenue Communist propagandists of today via racial treason and glorified miscegenation, might be something they might wish to abandon tomorrow?</p>
<p>My hope is, they never get the chance to cover those tracks!!!</p>

They&rsquo;d never show a muslim &#8220;imam&#8221; in that light.</p>
