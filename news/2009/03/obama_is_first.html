<h1>Obama Is &#8216;First Hispanic President,&rsquo; Geraldo Rivera Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, CNS News (Cybercast News Service), March 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Journalist and TV personality Geraldo Rivera summed up the optimism of pro-immigrant activists and mostly Democrat politicians at the 13th annual U.S.-Mexico Congressional Border Issues Conference by saying he is confident President Barack Obama will keep his campaign promise to sign &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; into law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barack Obama is the first Hispanic president the same way Bill Clinton was the first black&#8221; president, Rivera said at the conference, which took place Thursday at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Rivera also said the Hispanic community should &#8220;give the president some slack&#8221; in keeping that promise on immigration reform, given the pressing problems with the economy and other priorities, including health care.</p>
<p>At the conference&rsquo;s morning panel, experts and activists called on the Obama administration to champion &#8220;rational&#8221; immigration reform that would give the estimated 12 to 14 million people who are in the country illegally a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rivera proposed steps he said could be done &#8220;within the end of this week,&#8221; such as Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano ordering the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel to &#8220;stop the raids&#8221; and concentrate on stopping the drug cartels and Mexican gangs responsible for most of the more than 7,000 deaths south of the border in the last 14 months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He also said that illegal aliens should be allowed to join the military, which could make them eligible to become citizens at the end of their service.</p>
<p>When asked by a participant at the event what could be done to get the media to support comprehensive immigration reform, Rivera said people who are against it have a &#8220;truly hateful, deep sentiment&#8221; and a &#8220;deep nativist thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them have never seen a Hispanic person in person, much less an undocumented or illegal worker,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re not going to get any help from the media, I can tell you that much,&#8221; Rivera said. &#8220;If you want to cure a low-rated program or unpopular host, all you have to do is bash an undocumented immigrant or illegal alien.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, the other side of the immigration debate controls the American media,&#8221; Rivera said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Juan Hernandez, who has dual U.S. and Mexican citizenship and served as an advisor to former Mexican President Vicente Fox, moderated the panel.<br>

			<p>The Anglo-Celtic Bill Clinton was our first black President.</p>
<p>Now the half-African Luo &amp; half WASP Barrack Obama is our first Hispanic President.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what curious mix our first Asian President will be.</p>

			<p>Geraldo pushing &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; (i.e. amnesty) is ironic.  After 9/11, the Fox over the air broadcast network started a weekly hour long news magazine called &#8220;The Pulse,&#8221; hosted by Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.  Its very first segment was done by Geraldo Rivera, about how radical Islamic terrorists had Hispanic help in sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, also with the implicit help of the Bush/Clinton open borders policies.   Yes, Geraldo was denouncing open borders.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pulse&#8221; did not last long.</p>

<p>I know Mr. Rivera now works for the allegedly &#8216;conservative&rsquo; Fox News but Mr. Rivera is first an Hispanic and second a liberal.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this guy read any major newspaper? Article after article is an endless stream of pity pieces about &#8216;poor, mistreated, misunderstood, innocent, immigrant victims of xenophobes, racists, and bigots&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re all written from the same template: poor innocent &#8216;immigrant&rsquo; and &#8216;migrant&rsquo; who just wants a chance at a better life. The only thing stopping them from realizing their dream are ignorant bigots and haters who are blind to how wonderful these people are.</p>
<p>I have yet to read an article in the MSM that questions how and why illegals are here and whether we as a nation have a right to control our borders.<br>

			<p>I always despised this fake, phony fraud. The former Jerry Rivers (half Puerto Rican/Half Jewish) whole career is due to Hispanic Affirmative Action (and in that regard of course he would feel an infinity for Obamalama and his wife, two AA beneficiaries ad nauseum). This skunk is a total louse, ask Kurt Vonnegut whose daughter was played by El Conquistador. It is sad that Fox actual gives him airtime. Ay Caramba!</p>

<p>Wrong, Geraldo.  Clinton was our first black president, but BUSH was the first Hispanic president.  Obama, on the other hand, is our first FEMALE president:</p>

<p>I grew up in rural county that had zero blacks. Still doesn&rsquo;t. But a couple of the towns in the county are now 50 percent Hispanic. That&rsquo;s how widespread their presence has become. This &#8220;reporter&#8221; is showing his lack of knowledge of what is actually going on in the U.S. with uninformed statements like this.  </p>

			<p>Geraldo is nothing but an anti-White racist to begin with..Remember his &#8220;coverage&#8221; 24/7 of Katrina? His anti-White bias and pro-black bias really came home to roost for all the world to see.</p>

			<p>Geraldo Rivera is one of the most loathsome characters on television. I have always found the man repellent on a level I almost cannot explain - just an intense dislike and unease about someone on sight. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust the man as far as I could throw him! FNC should be embarassed at employing this clown for so long. That they are not, only reinforces why I have little regard for that nework either.    </p>

			<p>  Rivera is pro Hispanic. Anybody that trys to stop Mexicans from jumping the border, Rivera is against. He&rsquo;s just an Hispanic looking out for other Hispanics. When will Whites look out for other Whites?</p>

			<p>Rivera is a shill for third world immigration.This shows that Fox is not very good on immigration.Much of their coverage emphasizes the need for cheap immigrant labor.</p>

			<p>I think Fox is pretty much fed up with Rivera but is keeping him because of some contractual agreement. Fox doesn&rsquo;t seem to use Rivera any more than it has to. I do know that previously Rivera had more air time on Fox than he has now. I also think Fox would like to get rid of him and I think he will soon be gone. I sure hope so.</p>

			<p>Geraldo has been on the lecture circuit for years lobbying Bush and now Obama to pardon upwards of 20 million illegal aliens who broke our immigration laws.  He is on the same page as &#8220;conservative&#8221; senators McCain and Grahamnesty but has added a new twist.  Geraldo says that people who don&rsquo;t agree with him are bigots and haters and have a &#8220;truly hateful, deep sentiment&#8221; and a &#8220;deep nativist thing.&#8221;  This is something like the blacks said during the presidential election that you were racist if you didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama. I&rsquo;ve had just about enough of Geraldo!</p>

<p>So Jerry Rivers has the bright idea to hire illegal aliens for our military. Way to go, Jerry! Get a bunch of foreigners who obey orders like good little Nazis when told to shoot at <i>real</i> American citizens. Real smart. </p>
<p>Media whores are fighting tooth and nail for all the respect normally reserved for lawyers in our society.</p>

			<p>  So Obama is open borders. Does that make him Hispanic? So were Bush and Clinton. There&rsquo;s really no difference in all their immigration policies. </p>

			<p>Geraldo Rivera must be taken head on. Always point out that 1)Rivera&rsquo;s politics are completely racial-hispanic variety 2)that his intent and the intent of other hispanic leaders is to reduce theb Native Born White American population to an ever dwindling racial racial group within borders of America through massive hispanic immigration and hispanics outbreeding Native Born White Americans..this should be followed up with the question:Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of this? Next accuse Geraldo Rivera of being a racist for wanting to do this to Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>WE better start hurling the racism charge back at the hispanics. It is long over due.</p>
<p>Now if you are representative from numbersusa.com you will say to the racist Rivera:Geraldo, immigration harms the new hispanic immigrant worse other racial group in the US.</p>
<p>No one should financially support numbersusa.com. Numbersusa has whited out Native Born White Americans from the immigration debate. It is good see that Peter Brimelow is getting fed up with anti-white shenanigans of Roy Beck.</p>

<p>Yesh, sure.  Just wait until the black/Hispanic wars intensify the further we get into this depression.</p>
<p>Geraldo suffers from a mental disorder in that he wants to &#8220;spit&#8221; in anybody&rsquo;s face who says illegal aliens are not good for this country, just as he told Michelle Malkin.</p>

<p>During the declining years of the Roman Empire, the ranks of the legions were filled out with German mercenaries who had no real loyalty to Rome. Just something to ponder.</p>

<p>True but they were white mercenaries. I doubt Europe would have so many blacks if we (the U.S.) hadn&rsquo;t been so liberal with bringing them at the end of and after WWII. I know Germans who had NEVER seen a black before the end of WWII and they wish they had never seen one now. </p>
