			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Hickley, Daily Mail (London), March 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Government has failed to &#8216;get control&rsquo; of the issue of immigration, ministers admitted today.</p>
<p>Phill Woolas, the Immigration Minister, said he was not surprised by findings of a poll which showed that nearly eight out of ten people believe all unemployed foreign migrants should be asked to leave the UK.</p>
<p>Mr Woolas said the the British people would never be comfortable with immigration until they believe ministers have a firm grip on the nation&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p>Mr Woolas said: &#8216;The poll figures are not a surprise. They are a concern, and in significant part they are because the public don&rsquo;t believe that the government has got control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;The central goal of my immigration policy is to provide the assurance to the public that we know who&rsquo;s here and who&rsquo;s not here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The minister claimed opposition to foreign workers was &#8216;based on the belief that the immigrant has no legitimate right to be here,&rsquo; adding: &#8216;We will only get a country that is comfortable with immigration when we can show the Government has it under control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Woolas&rsquo;s admission highlights the Labour Government&rsquo;s defensiveness over immigration  &mdash;  following years of increasingly tough rhetoric and repeated efforts to tighten controls.</p>
<p>More than half of those surveyed in the poll for the Financial Times opposed giving other EU citizens the right to live and work in Britain  &mdash;  one of the cornerstone principles of the European Union.</p>
<p>It questioned thousands of people across the UK, Europe and the United States regarding immigration and the economy.</p>
<p>Among the British public it highlights widespread ill-feeling towards foreign workers at a time when unemployment is nearing the two million mark.</p>
<p>In the UK a huge majority  &mdash;  78 per cent  &mdash;  believed immigrants should be asked to leave the country if they do not have a job, with only 14 per cent disagreeing and eight per cent undecided.</p>
<p>A similar number held the same view in Italy along with sizeable majorities in Spain, Germany and the U.S. and around half of those questioned in France.</p>
<p>Just over half of British adults opposed the right of all EU citizens to settle and work in Britain.</p>
<p>A narrow majority of Germans agreed, while there was slightly more support for the right of free movement and access to Labour markets among French, Italians and Spaniards.</p>
<p>An estimated one million foreign workers flocked to the UK after eight eastern European states joined the union in 2004.</p>
<p>Most other member states exercised a treaty right to bar eastern Europeans from their own job markets, but Britain allowed a free-for-all and the huge numbers arriving massively exceeded the Government&rsquo;s expectations.</p>
<p>Shadow Immigration Minister Damian Green said: &#8216;What this poll represents is the combination of that policy failure with the obvious pressures on the job market because of the recession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phil Woolas suffered a further setback yesterday when watchdogs rejected his criticism of the Office for National Statistics over its release of immigrant population figures last month.</p>
<p>The ONS brought forward the published of the startling figures  &mdash;  showing that one in nine UK residents was born overseas  &mdash;  because of officials judged that the material was topical and important to the immigration debate.</p>
<p>But Phil Woolas, who faced embarrassment over the figures, unleashed a ferocious attack on the independent statisticians accusing them of straying into &#8216;the most inflamed debate in British politics&rsquo; and claiming the release was &#8216;at best naive, or, at worst, sinister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Today the UK Statistics Authority gave its strong backing to the ONS, concluding that the publication was &#8216;consistent&rsquo; with the rules and the timing was &#8216;influenced by the level of public interest in the topic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ONS&rsquo;s press release was &#8216;factually accurate&rsquo; and &#8216;neutral and impartial&rsquo; in tone, the watchdog added, whereas failing to publish the figures could have led to a misinformed debate based on flawed figures  &mdash;  although it said the ONS should have made a formal announcement explaining why it was bringing the publication forward, and included more supporting information.</p>

			<p>Well, the SPLC has started already.  I think everybody knows they and the ADL manipulate their way into these backward police forces around the country, pretending to be &#8220;experts&#8221; on terrorists and standing for love and tolerance themselves, going so far as to volunteer their services to act as advisors for the police for free, convincing the rubes that every conservative person in the country is a wild eyed militia terrorist.</p>
<p>With such a fantastically high number of people in Europe and the US all for curbing immigration and sending the crime and poverty rabble back home, the SPLC and the ADL are shrieking hysterically once more that all those people are militia terrorists.</p>
<p>Are you a Ron Paul supporter?  Then you&rsquo;re a militia terrorist.  Do you advocate Tea Part protests?  Then you&rsquo;re also a militia terrorist.  Do you complain that our borders are wide open and should be closed?  Well, you&rsquo;re a militia terrorist also.  On and on and on it goes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a group of police and &#8220;fusion advisors&#8221; who have bought into this nonsense, because they&rsquo;re so naive and gullible.</p>
<p>http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2009/mar/14/fusion-center-data-draws-fire-over-assertions/</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say a word about the SPLC or the ADL, but their fingerprints are all over this policy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the funding for both groups will be reduced drastically, because of the worsening conditions and both will likely have to cut back on both programs and personnel eventually.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping they both go completely broke or black mobs decide they&rsquo;d like to have their assets.  What a great outcome either would be.</p>

			<p>Woolas&rsquo; attack on the ONS shows what his real concerns are. Hopefully the BNP can destroy the labour party the way the Italian facists have the left in their country.</p>

			<p>&#8220;opposition ..was based on the belief the immigrant has no legitimate right to be here&#8221;&hellip; Brain-dead Labour party minister.</p>
<p>That is correct. Now you&rsquo;ve got it mate! They have NO RIGHT to be in Britain at all. Immigration is a privilege not a right. Only the British people have a right to be in Britain.</p>

			<p>i&rsquo;m glad to see people in europe have started to wake up to what immigration has done to their countries. unfortunately they have limited their outrage to anonymous polls. unless the european people take to the streets in large numbers and defy the muslims and leftists who hurl ad hominem attacks at them then there will not be any real change. i hope that day comes before the immigrants become a large enough group that they, along with the useful idiots on the left, expand hate speech laws and make such demonstrations illegal. this is a welcoming sign though.</p>
<p>god save the west!</p>

			<p>Only half of the people in France think that unemployed immigrants should be told to leave?  What do the other half think?  That France should open its borders and welfare programs to everyone in the world?  No wonder France is on track to be the first Islamic state in Western Europe.<br/>
The poll results from the UK and Italy are encouraging.  Too bad only Italy has the current political climate to do anything about it.  The only party in the UK that will do anything to represent the will of the people on immigration is the BNP and, unfortunately, the BNP has a long way to go to be a viable political option.  Of course, things are so volitile right now that anything could happen; the June Euro elections will be a good indication of the BNP&rsquo;s chances of future success. </p>

<p>No way will the funding for these groups be stopped, the sun will rise in the WEST first!</p>

			<p>What is wrong with people?!? After looking at these graphs, I see fully half the respondents are fall under the ambiguous cataloger&rsquo;s of unsure or somewhat sure/unsure. How do these people even decide on a president? &#8220;Hmmmm, can I vote half for Obama and half for Bush?&#8221;   </p>
<p>Grow a spine and stand for something already!</p>

			<p>Not coincidentally, France has since the Revolution identified itself more strongly with the Propostional Nation complex of ideas than any other nation on earth. Some quarters of France see the nation as glorious for the &#8220;eternal&#8221; propositions of Liberte, Egalitie, Fraternitie. The dissociation of France from its people and its marriage to ideas is strongly opposed by many more conservative citizens, of course. Yet the very long time these ideas have persisted even as the nation faces colonization from without testifies to the narcotic effect of the pursuit of glory. <br/>
I don&rsquo;t know if the French can hold on to their country. They would have to rid themselves of illusions about human nature and simply face the fact that the Muslims, Africans etc. want to live in France and take over as much as they can for reasons no more profound than that they think they can, and the kids they sire think it even more intensely.<br/>
Read Neitzsche. Forget Rousseau.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure why they even WANT to overrun the place and take over. Once that has been accomplished it will have become Third World and then the purse will be empty. There is not thought for the future, it&rsquo;s just a take-what-I-can-now situation.</p>

			<p>To Gorewell:<br/>
The will to power, which is what the Islamics in France and elsewhere are exhibiting, has no economic correlations. It is an irrationalist position and so the &#8220;trade-offs&#8221; economic types love to prattle on about has no bearing on the matter. Unfortunately the genetic code does carry it forward and judging from what I see today the drive is intensified even as it becomes more irrational. When I first became aware of suicide bombings I thought how wierd it was that this kamikaze method was the first resort of combat whereas with the Japanese it was a last resort.   </p>

			<p>&#8220;More than three-quarters of Britons want to see jobless immigrants forced to leave the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bit of a red herring this. The term, &#8216;Britons&rsquo; demographically refers to indigenous Celts and Anglo-Saxons - not to foreigners with or without British passports.<br/>
If this is the case I would say that 100% of Britons want to see all foreigners with no allegiance to Britain off its soil and living somewhere else.</p>
