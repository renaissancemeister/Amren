<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/19454.html">Steele Pledges to Fight for Black Vote</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nia-Malika Henderson, The Politico, February 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican national chairman Michael Steele pledged Saturday to take his party into &#8220;every corner, every community center, every church&#8221; to fight for the black vote  &mdash;  a vote that went 95 percent for President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>And at the State of Black America forum, he got a reminder of just how hard that would be, even for the first African-American to lead the Republican party.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t for lack of trying by Steele, who has talked in recent weeks about creating a new Republican party  &mdash;  one that is younger and more diverse, even cool. At the forum, Steele shared a stage with the Rev. Al Sharpton and other prominent liberals. And even Steele faulted his own party for ignoring the black community too long.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not monolithic in our thought,&#8221; Steele said. &#8220;There is a diversity of opinion that can be expressed on economics, health care, on policies that affect us directly. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, that opportunity to bring my party to the community,&#8221; Steele said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He insisted his position as the head of the Republican party wasn&rsquo;t about confronting Obama, instead trying to keep the focus on common ground.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steele isn&rsquo;t the first top Republican to make a bid for black votes. Support for the Republican party swelled to 11 percent in the 2004 presidential election. John McCain, however, got 4 percent of the black vote in 2008.</p>
<p>Still, the Republican party came under fire from panelists who said Steele needed to, in effect, get the GOP in line. Sharpton said the 2008 was a clear rejection of the Republican party and that &#8220;America made an Obama decision by being ambushed for eight years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not in any way born with any party in our DNA. We support who supports us,&#8221; Sharpton said of black voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steele joined the crowd in giving Sharpton a standing ovation when he talked about the successes of the civil rights struggles and how it opened doors for blacks. And they both agreed that Obama changed electoral politics by engaging the grass roots, young people and using technology.</p>
<p>Steele just hired Angela Sailor, a black woman, to oversee outreach efforts  &mdash;  she was formerly director of African-American affairs for the GOP.</p>

			<p>Steele should know that the white vote is for the GOP and that is the only vote that the GOP will get. The GOP can pander to any non-white group and still get a small minority of the vote.  Steele is a fool and should go to the other party.</p>

			<p>I firmly believe that I will never again vote, campaign, or donate for a Republican. Mr. Steele intends to win Black votes, not by embracing Conservative values such as small Government, pride in family and heritage, and secure borders, bunt instead plans to pander to the lowest depths of liberal social policy. </p>
<p>In chief, he will not rest until Republicans are even more like the Democrats than they already are (hard to imagine, isn&rsquo;t it?) and I can only pray that more and more people wake up and vote Libertarian or Constitution, depending on who suits them best. </p>
<p>Finding &#8220;common ground&#8221; with a Socialist, as Steele wishes to do, is fiendish indeed. </p>

			<p>I wrote a letter to the RNC headquarters when this guy was nominated about my disapproval of Steele and how I wouldn&rsquo;t donate a dime until they forced him to resign.  I got a letter back from them today and I just handed it to the postman without opening it so they could stamp it &#8220;Refused-Return to Sender&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nothing but a form letter with a request for a donation.  The Republican Party is dead, vote &#8220;alternative&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The Democratic party is openly anti-White. The Reublican party is openly anti-White. Politics abhors a vacum. The poltical vacum will be filled. Why does Peter Brimelow want to save the Republican party? </p>

			<p>If we want diversity it is blacks that are going to have to change.  With 97% of black people voting for the black candidate that should seem obvious even to Attorney General Holder.  </p>

			<p>Sure, Steele, I can just see you convincing blacks to vote for the Republican nominee in 2012 (probably white) over Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Just to show you what an ingrate Steele is, I was able to catch the first segment of the third hour of Rush&rsquo;s show today.  Steele made some smart aleck crack about Rush and talk radio being &#8220;incindeary&#8221; and &#8220;ugly.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Rush&rsquo;s response was that Steele practically got on his knees and begged Rush for time on his show to refute the Michael J. Fox stem cell ads in 2006, when Steele was trying to win an election in his own right.  Rush didn&rsquo;t say this, but his letting Steele on was skating on thin ice, because Steele was a candidate for office at the time, and Ben Cardin could have gone to every radio station that aired Rush/Steele and asked for equal time, Rush was taking a big bureaucratic risk.</p>
<p>And now you see how Steele paid Rush back three years later.  This foreshadows things to come for his RNC management.</p>
<p>I have said this before, and it&rsquo;s worth saying again.  Michael Steele has never won a public elected office on his own accord.  The Lieutenant Governor of Maryland is a running mate at the choosing of the candidate for Governor.  Steele was Bob Ehrlich&rsquo;s running mate, nothing more.</p>

			<p>Electoral politics must be realistic in order to be successful. Any person who believes in self-reliance, believes that America is a land brimming with opportunites for those who work hard and live responsibly will vote Republican. The problem is finding many black people who believe their own eyes. The numbers of blacks who find success in industry, entertainment, and sports gives the lie to the notion that we live in a racist society. If that were true, why would AMEX sponsor Tiger Woods? Why would Whites enthusiastically support Oprah Winfrey in her every  endeavor? Why would so many Whites vote for Barack Obama? </p>
<p>The truth is that the Republican party asks you to take reponsibility for your life, and there is only a small minority of blacks who are willing to do so. Nothing can ever change this, it is just Nature. Blacks have always voted for whomever promises them the biggest check on the first of the month. Unless Steele is willing to one-up the Dems and hand out checks, cars, weed and women, he cannot capture more than 5 or 10% of the black vote.</p>

			<p> Sorry Mike, but the GOP hasn&rsquo;t been ignoring blacks. They<br>
went out of their way to court blacks. And each time it was<br>
an exercise in futility. The Left owns the black vote as<br>
long as it keeps the gravy train rolling.</p>

			<p>Now Steele will take the party further to the left in search of a tiny fraction of black voters that will consider voting Republican.  How pathetic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GOP overlooked a huge potential of voters by deliberately denying Ron Paul a voice. The GOP tried to keep him out of the GOP debates, even though Ron Paul represented the core values of what many in the GOP used to espouse.  </p>
<p>Ron Paul represented a huge pool of independents and moderates from both parties, but the GOP had nothing but scorn for him and his voters.</p>
<p>The GOP nominated the most liberal candidate, McCain, and where did it get them?  Nowhere.  I didn&rsquo;t vote for McCain nor did many other Independents and Republicans.  Heck, there was almost an immediate revolt among Republicans when the Neocons nominated McCain.</p>
<p>The GOP continually praised Bush even when it was evident Bush was arguably the worst president in modern times.  Did Bush keep us out of nation building?  Did he lower the deficit?  Did he dismantal affirmative action?  No, he governed as a Democrat.</p>
<p>The GOP nominated as it&rsquo;s chairman an African American that supports Affirmative Action.  Talk about out of step with the base.</p>
<p>The GOP does not listen to or represent the vast majority of white conservatives who make up the GOP, so why should we listen to them.</p>
<p>Let the GOP fall.  They don&rsquo;t represent us anyway.  It is better to remove the illusion of representation, so we can start to understand the reality of having no representation.</p>

			<p>Steel is going to need to find a lot of blacks to vote for the GOP because my guess is that a whole lot of us white conservatives will be staying home for the 2010 elections.  I won&rsquo;t vote for the Republicans or any other party until they start paying attention to protecting the white middle and working class majority of this nation.</p>

			<p>Here it is again.  Elect or appoint a black to a position and it automatically sets in motion his desire to promote his own kind above all other things.</p>
<p>Blacks are natural communists, because they can&rsquo;t compete on an even playing field, so if the Republican Party doesn&rsquo;t change their platform to a communist one, forget it, few blacks will support it.</p>
<p>He might get about 250,000 blacks, but he&rsquo;ll lose 20 million whites.  Another smart Republican move, eh?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a disaster.</p>
<p>These foolish Republican elites need to learn that lesson, because that&rsquo;s exactly what will happen.</p>
<p>This is the same bunch who pushed to get McCain and Dole nominated, two complete disasters.  Neither one has any versatility or real intelligence and both are inarticulate. How these elitist fools considered otherwise is beyond my understanding.</p>
<p>They lost Congress in two elections, plus the presidency, all because we had a mentally challenged, inarticulate president who was talked into attacking Iraq, pushing for amnesty with illegals, and increasing the size of government, everything the Republican base was against.</p>
<p>And, guess what?  They still haven&rsquo;t a clue that what they&rsquo;ve been doing is pure stupidity.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need a third party.  We need to break up into smaller nation-states, according to race and political ideology.</p>

			<p>The Republicans are being taken over by neo-cons who want to move the party to the left, either because of their leftist ideology or they want to purposely destroy the party or make it a non-player, and they have infiltrated it specifically for that purpose.</p>
<p>These are the bunch who despise the mom, God, and apple pie types, and the salt of the earth people who are staunch Reaganites and who made the party so successful in the past.</p>
<p>It is they who loudly protested Sarah Palin, because she represented just that conservative base, which would not allow them to move the party to the left.  They tried to destroy Palin by setting her up with interviews with Charles Gibson and Katie Couric, two leftist ideologues who were rubbing their hands together hoping to get a chance to do something harmful to her, and she innocently walked right into the trap the neo-cons set for her.  McCain is just not bright enough to have noticed what was going on.  He&rsquo;s as much a victim of the neo-cons as Bush.  Both can be turned anyway these people want them.  Such incompetence.</p>
<p>Nobody sincere, with half a brain, would schedule interviews with two far left dimwits whose entire agenda was to get the Obamanation elected.</p>
<p>It is these types that helped get this black as RNC chairman, because they knew his first order of business would be to get his tribal kin into the Republican party.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t work.  Unless the Republican return to their core values, which DOES NOT pander to blacks, they&rsquo;re finished as a serious political party. <br>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that Micheal S. Steele is willing to use unappetizing labels for Euro-Americans like &#8220;white bread,&#8221; an odd food-based slur made popular by the Dick Van Dyke television show as an all-purpose put-down of the diverse white American peoples. </p>
<p>The term &#8220;white bread&#8221; is a way to show contempt toward European Americans, and it is a way to smother white American diversity and nationality under an unwanted label. (You never see &#8220;diverse white bread Americans&#8221; for example.)<br>
 <br>
Michael S. Steele was reported on Politico on 12/9/08 as saying, &ldquo;The Republican Party&rsquo;s strength comes in many forms and many hues. We have to understand now it&rsquo;s not all white bread.&rdquo; To have the insult of &#8220;white bread&#8221; hurled by a former Republican Lieutenant Governor of Maryland who is now the chairman of the National Republican Party tells us our status in that political party as loudly and clearly as anything can.<br>

			<p>Michael Steele has been appearing many talk shows.  Not one host has had the backbone to ask him his views on affirmative action.  I would like to see him take a lie detector test in which the first question would be &#8216;Who did you vote for in the presidential election?&rsquo;.  My belief is that he voted for Obama.</p>

			<p>Steele will utterly humiliate the republicans before destroying them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if there is karma for stupidity, the republicans are surely a living example of it, and deserve their hip hop chairman and their path of irrelevancy (which is far superior to the fumes of fear, their former ace in the hole).</p>
<p>The path they are on was avoidable, yet they ceded the cultural and spiritual authority to the left, and are now reaping the long-term consequences.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The GOP is basically finished.  Very few white people will vote for them now.  If David Duke is smart, he&rsquo;ll create a new, white person&rsquo;s party and repackage it as a form of conservativism.  There is a huge advantage to the GOP not even pretending anymore.</p>
<p>Better yet, many, if not most of the states are showing real signs that they are considering secession as a solution to the liberal multicult problem.  That begs for a different, more local strategy.  To make sure that RACE is correctly identifyed as the primary problem that has caused the downfall of the federal government and lead to so many disaffected whites who simply want to leave.</p>
<p>There is an opportunity here to seceed and create a de facto, then formal, ethno-state.  Perhaps a large one that consists of the majority of the US.  As the new country flourishes and the old remnants of amerika disintegrates, expansion could reclaim much of that land&hellip;.this time with protections in place that prevent a recreation of the problem.</p>

			<p>The only reason Steele got put in charge of the RNC is because he&rsquo;s black.  The GOP cannot pander enough to attract more than a sliver of the black vote.  The reason McCain lost is that he got 11 percent fewer votes from white males, and 4 percent fewer votes from white females.  If McCain had held on to the same level of white support as Bush had done, he would have be elected.  Unfortunately, too many white people, PO&rsquo;d about losing money in the meltdown threw caution to the wind and voted for 0bama.  Now we are about to reap the whirl wind of crushing debt, and even more minority priviledge than we ever thought possible.  I warned way back in Sept that if the white working class handed obama the election that they would get the mugging of a life time, and so it is.</p>

			<p>Mr. Steele is another disaster for GOP. As if we didn&rsquo;t have talented leaders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious why he was chosen while Sarah Palin wasn&rsquo;t even considerd: because she was unapologetically white, and in great style so, why he was not.</p>
<p>As if RNC thought that the worse the better.<br>

			<p>Please help me out on this one ( I am not American but have tried to stay in tune with US politics for years, although I am still getting over the shock of the Obama win). I really would appreciate someone explaining this to me in layman&rsquo;s terms :</p>
<p>Why is the black (or non-white in general) vote so important ? I don&rsquo;t get it. Surely if the GOP had stopped pandering to non-whites, and declared itself blatantly pro-white or at least conservative, would it not have drawn more votes ? Whites still are the majority - aren&rsquo;t they.</p>
<p>I realise that those whites who voted for BHO would have voted for him anyway - so what would the GOP have had to lose? Would their future not have been the white voters&rsquo; bloc ?</p>

			<p> I&rsquo;ve been a republican all my life! I just became an Independant! I&rsquo;ll not support any party that becomes pro entitlements and such,as I&rsquo;m sure that Steele will go there, he&rsquo;ll have to. The blacks will only vote for the party that promises them the most.The Dems. have been kissing up to them for years! For the Republican party to seek favor from Rev. Al Shyster and his cronies is the stupidest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard of! This is just one more nail in the coffin of a once great GOP. The Grand Old Party doesn&rsquo;t sound so &#8220;grand&#8221; anymore does it?&hellip;..teach your children well and may God help us all.</p>

<p>  Right you are Dr. Caligari! From Lee Atwater to John McCain the GOP has tried to gain black votes without success. It is a useless and stupid move  &mdash;  at best only 10% of blacks will ever vote Republican. <br>

			<p>Well, just like I thought, if they can&rsquo;t beat em, join em.  <br>
I voted for Mike Huckabee in the primaries, and then when RINO, John McCain won, I could not vote for him, so I voted for Baldwin, of the Constitution party.  People told me my vote was a wasted vote, but I have a quote ready for them from John Quincy Adams, about voting your principles, and knowing such a vote is never wasted.  </p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s true, the Republican party IS dead.  It&rsquo;s just becoming another spin-off of the Democratic party, absorbed into and swallowed up by socialism, affirmative action, and everything else that wants to destroy what this country was really founded on. </p>

			<p>I do not understand the Ron Paul fixation among some of you. Ron Paul is completetly  aracial. He pushes another form of aracial abstractionism:FREE MARKETS. He stated in an interview with Peter Brimelow that he was in favor of significantly inceasing  post-1965 immigration-in other words, a large exponential incease in the number of predatory asians entering OUR America.</p>
<p>And enough of this nonesense about how the Republican party is the party of rugged indivualistic capitalism. The Republican Red states live off of the military industrial complex-BIG GOVERMENT. Red State &#8220;rugged&#8221; Republicans lived off of Cold War militarism which..as a I stated in a different thread&hellip; required the integration of the US military and American society..which resulted in a massive  increase  of the raping of White Women by black men.</p>
<p>Either Native Born White Americans politically organize round their legitmate racial interests or they will face complete racial dispossession at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans. The aracial-free-wheeling capitalism of Ron Paul is a death sentence for Native Born White America. This should be obvious.</p>

			<p>Steele said. <i>&ldquo;There is a diversity of opinion that can be expressed on economics, health care, on policies that affect us directly.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A lie. If that were true then blacks would not always vote for democrats 90+% of the time.  The litmus test for most blacks is whether or not you are in favor of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; or anti-white discrimination. If not and you are black you are a &#8220;sell-out&#8221;.   </p>

			<p>      These morons are followers-of the Democrats. A Black Man<br>
becomes President so they decide to put a Black as head of the<br>
Republicans. Now they&rsquo;re trying to bring Bobby Jindal along just<br>
as the Democrats brought Obama along. Both are young, &#8220;likeable&#8221;<br>
and of course, non White. The Republicans stand for nothing at<br>
all except getting elected and passing the pork. No wonder they<br>
get such big pork bellies-it&rsquo;s from the pork! It&rsquo;s appropriate-<br>
after all, they are pigs.</p>

			<p>Steele and the boobs in the GOP who put this guy in charge of the RNC, have finally disgusted me enough so that I&rsquo;m leaving the party.  I&rsquo;ll find another party.  Winning isn&rsquo;t everything. Being right, is.</p>

<p>Your observation about Ron Paul is correct, but many WNs and RRs coalesced behind his campaign because libertarianism, especially on the part of the Federal government, would accrue to the disparate impact of whites and WN/RR.  No Federal government imposing affirmative action, protecting blacks who move into white neighborhoods, funding black and Hispanic rabble rousing groups.</p>
<p>Would it work out so well?  I doubt it.  All it would mean is that the power vacuum left by the race pandering Federal government would be filled by race pandering corporations.  And the southern border would be left open (which it pretty much is now anyway.)</p>
<p>My ideal paradigm would be a level of government in between what Paulites want and what exists now, big enough to clamp down on predatory capitalism, but not itself predatorily collectivist.  And enough to enforce real border security, and enough of a military to defend such borders.</p>

<p>Why is the black (or non-white in general) vote so important ? Whites still are the majority - aren&rsquo;t they.</p>
<p>Posted by Commando at 4:02 AM on March 3 </p>
<p>___________________________________</p>
<p>Commando, thank you for taking an interest in us!  Yes, whites are currently the majority in the U.S., but our numbers are rapidly diminishing because of non-white immigration and a non-white baby boom.  The government doesn&rsquo;t want us to be fully aware of what is happening, though, so Middle Easterners are counted as white, and mestizos are often counted as white, as well as other groups. </p>
<p>Our politicians are trying to align themselves with non-European Americans because they see them as the majority in the very near future.  There has been an agenda since the mid-1960s to make the U.S. into a multicultural land where whites are a tiny minority.  People are being brainwashed that this will make our country into a better place.  </p>
<p>I think the reason politicians want to replace white Americans with Third Worlders is that we are too independent, creative and intelligent, therefore harder to control.  Our country&rsquo;s elite want to be as wealthy and powerful as they are in Mexico, and it is easier for them to outwit and fleece people who are significantly less intelligent, say, by 30 I.Q. points, than those who are closer in I.Q.</p>

			<p>If we are all the same as the universalist and multiculturalist always claim then why would the GOP need to &#8220;change&#8221; to go after the &#8220;black&#8221; vote? </p>

			<p>&#8220;Why is the black (or non-white in general) vote so important ? I don&rsquo;t get it. Surely if the GOP had stopped pandering to non-whites, and declared itself blatantly pro-white or at least conservative, would it not have drawn more votes ? Whites still are the majority - aren&rsquo;t they.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, us voting Whites are 74% of the electorate. In every election roughly 33% of Whites for Democrats.  These are your reds, feminists, sexual perverts and what not who side with the nonwhites as a power ploy.  Blacks are about 10% of the electorate and they&rsquo;re crucial for a Democrat to get elected to a national office.  The Republican Party is about 90% White and usually in an election the majority (about 55-60%) vote Republican.  Normally, this is enough to beat the Democrats (Clinton had been the only Democrat President in almost 30 years) but large Hispanic immigration is changing the demographics against them.  Only about a third of them vote Republican.  If the Republican Party would embrace nationalism, put America first, halt immigration from the third world, trash NAFTA and rebuild our industrial infrastructure, it would sweep an election.  The problem is both parties are controlled by the same people.</p>

Add to that&hellip; end affirmative action, uphold the constitution, critically examine the fed reserve, guard the borders, stop interfering in affairs overseas and acknowledge that the US was established as a white nation.<br>
<i>&#8220;The problem is both parties are controlled by the same people.&#8221;</i> <br>
Yes, they are.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;And now you see how Steele paid Rush back three years later. This foreshadows things to come for his RNC management&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They (especially Rush) should have already received this message when colin powell backed obama  &mdash;  do you think the idiots in the RNC (rnc from now on)have learned anything?  </p>
<p>Now Steele is talking about reaching out to the hip-hop crowd.  Yeah, that ought to go over well with White voters.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t voted Republican since Reagan in the early 80s  &mdash;  straight Libertarian ticket for this house, with good reason.  </p>
<p>The GOP abandoned its base years ago  &mdash;  I was disgusted when Newt Gingrich became a babbling, pandering fool around Clinton.</p>
