			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Hope, Telegraph (London), March 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A study from the London School of Economics has estimated there are 725,000 foreigners living illegally in Britain.</p>
<p>The figure is 81 per cent more than the last Home Office estimate of 430,000 illegal migrants, which was made public in 2005.</p>
<p>BBC&rsquo;s Panorama programme last night claimed that at current rates of deportation, it would take 34 years and cost Â£8 billion to clear the backlog of people who are currently in the UK illegally.</p>
<p>The Home Office defended its estimate of the scale of illegal immigration, insisting that the 2005 figure was &#8220;only an estimate and should not be seen as a definitive figure&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;No Government has ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who may be in the country illegally.</p>
<p>&#8220;By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately, and that remains the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news has fuelled calls for an &#8220;amnesty&#8221; on illegal immigration, effectively allowing those who are already in the UK to stay here.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said the best way to deal with the backlog was to say that everyone here illegally would be able to work officially and eventually gain full citizenship.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;If people are going to be here and we&rsquo;ve chronically failed to kick them out it&rsquo;s morally right that they should contribute in their taxes to the rest of society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Johnson is on a collision course with his own Conservative party, which opposes the plans.</p>
<p>Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister, said: &#8220;The problem with amnesties is that they store up trouble for the future as people will always expect another one.</p>
<p>&#8220;The long term effect of an amnesty is therefore to encourage more illegal immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the Migrationwatch campaign group, said: &#8220;We have the biggest recession in memory getting under way, two million unemployed, heading up for three million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really suggested that British jobs should go to illegal workers? It just makes no sense at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Austin Ivereigh, spokesman for Strangers Into Citizens, which campaigns for long-term migrants to be given citizenship, said: &#8220;They&rsquo;ve ended up here. They&rsquo;ve put down roots. Their children are in our schools. They&rsquo;re often working.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to call them out of the shadows so they can play their part in society, they can pay taxes. This is a move that benefits everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, rejected the &#8220;earned amnesty&#8221; plan, saying it would only lead to more illegal immigration.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;What unfortunately would happen is that people traffickers and others would see that as a pull factor to get people to the United Kingdom illegally and we would end up with a bigger problem not just for our society, but for the people themselves involved.&#8221;<br>

			<p><i>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, rejected the &ldquo;earned amnesty&rdquo; plan, saying it would only lead to more illegal immigration.</i></p>
<p>A Labour immigration minister admitting this? Wow. Just, wow!</p>
<p>The open borders people lie. They lie everytime they open their big fat mouths. Kennedy has lied on every immigration bill he&rsquo;s pushed. The leftists lie because they want the destruction of Western society. Some &#8220;conservatives&#8221; (I use that term <i>very</i> loosely) lie because they want dirt cheap labor. The National Chamber of Commerce (aka, The Big CoC), the local Chambers of Commerce (aka The Little CoCs), the National Restaurant Association, hospitality associations, landscapers, homebuilders, and all the other 10,000 business groups demanding more immigration and amnesty lie - they are not charities!</p>
<p>What was their argument for the last decade? &#8220;Illegals do the jobs Americans (or Brits, or whomever) won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; Where&rsquo;s that argument now? Where, for that matter, was it then? We needed illegal construction workers to build millions of more homes than Americans could afford, homes that are now a moon-sized anchor on the global economy. We needed them to staff all the hotels and restaurants for those vacations and meals out that we really couldn&rsquo;t afford; when we should have been brown bagging it and going on campouts; when our teenagers should have been taking summer jobs rather than student loans.</p>
<p>They lie when they say this or that enforcement effort won&rsquo;t work. &#8220;Denying them driver&rsquo;s licenses won&rsquo;t work!&#8221; &#8220;Denying their kids public education won&rsquo;t work!&#8221; &#8220;Building a fence won&rsquo;t work!&#8221; &#8220;Immigration is a federal policy&#8221; (when states want to enforce the law). &#8220;Driver&rsquo;s licenses are the states&rsquo; business (when the feds, enforcing immigration law, want to ban states from issuing them licenses).</p>
<p>They will do or say anything to keep our laws from being enforced, to keep the numbers of immigrants from being reduced. If they don&rsquo;t lie then they&rsquo;re just open borders nutjobs, frequently, disproportionately women or eunuchs.</p>
<p>Amnesty has never worked, ever. Not only has it been tried (and failed) in this country, but it&rsquo;s been tried over a dozen times in various European countries and failed <i>every single time</i>!</p>

			<p>It is the legal ones not the illegals that are the problem.</p>

			<p>The same probably holds true for the US. If the true numbers are released, I think the 2010 census is going to be a real eye-opener.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re often working&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that they aren&rsquo;t LEGALLY entitled to welfare, they must be or they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive.</p>
<p>Maybe its time to review more welfare entitlements and check for illegals on welfare.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We needed illegal construction workers to build millions of more homes than Americans could afford, homes that are now a moon-sized anchor on the global economy. We needed them to staff all the hotels and restaurants for those vacations and meals out that we really couldn&rsquo;t afford; when we should have been brown bagging it and going on campouts; when our teenagers should have been taking summer jobs rather than student loans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly, Only a small percentage of immigrants were/are actually engaged in productive jobs, eg processing food, manufacturing machinery etc.</p>
<p>Most were/are providing services we couldn&rsquo;t really afford or making overlarge houses we can&rsquo;t afford to maintain.</p>
<p>If we hadn&rsquo;t had so much immigration, we would have lived within our means more and built cheaper, smaller houses and eaten out less, etc.</p>
<p>And with fewer immigrants it would also have been easier for students to get summer jobs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same story in Australia and New Zealand as it is the U.S, Canada, Britian and Ireland.</p>
