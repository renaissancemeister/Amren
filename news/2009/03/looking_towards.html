			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Neilsen Wire, March 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Population trends have clear implications for those involved in the media and advertising industries. There are now more than 114 million U.S. TV households, with immigration continuing to play a major role in population growth. U.S. Census estimates predict that by the year 2050 more than half of the U.S. population will be non-white.</p>
<p>Nielsen&rsquo;s &#8220;Ethnic Trends In Media,&#8221; is a comprehensive report profiling African-American, Asian, Hispanic and White households in the U.S.  This report examines household characteristics, television usage, timeshifted viewing and popular programming genres for each group.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<p>* Household characteristics are quite different across each ethnic break.  Size, geographic territory and media ownership, such as video game consoles and DVRs, are just some of the notable differences</p>
<p>* TV usage is different: Persons age 18-49 in African-American households view more TV than Total U.S., while Hispanic and Asian persons in the same age group was less.</p>
<p>* The median age of a TV viewer is 45, but African-American, Asian and Hispanic viewers tend to be younger (40, 39, 32, respectively).</p>
<p>* Participation variety shows, such as Dancing with the Stars and Biggest Loser 6, are the most popular genre for total U.S. viewers, and are near the top for all ethnic breaks.  Fox NFL Sunday Football was the top or near-top program for all ethnic breaks except for Hispanics, who favored &#8220;Fuego En La Sangre&#8221; on Univision.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Persons aged 18-49 in African-American households view more TV than Total US.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may be because their tastes are less sophisticated, making easier for them to stomache the unmitigated drivel the networks broadcast.</p>
<p>If someone took my books and computers away and forced me to watch TV as my primary means of entertainment, I&rsquo;d probably end up hanging myself.  Yes, once one has gone without TV for two decades, it really is THAT BAD.</p>

			<p>&#8220;U.S. Census estimates predict that by the year 2050 more than half of the U.S. population will be non-white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who really believes the trend researchers connected with the US census?  I mean, they&rsquo;ve never been correct on anything yet.</p>
<p>And curiously, may I ask why it is we only see reports that announce that whites are going to be a minority in the US in another 40 years, because it&rsquo;s such a long stretch down the road nothing else is forecast that far in advance?  Never.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re trying to mentally condition that concept in our minds, hoping that such pronouncements will intimidate us into giving up even more nowadays to non-whites.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the precipice of a global disaster that could change the demogrphic make up of the entire West, yet we have &#8220;researchers&#8221; coming out with projections of conditions in this country 40 years into the future?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re such experts at analyzing trends, why couldn&rsquo;t they have predicted the sub-prime crash?  And why can&rsquo;t they tell us what the result of all this turmoil is going to lead to in just two years?</p>
<p>This is such an obvious scam I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone is gullible enough to be intimidated by it.<br>

			<p>Looks like the little girl and the boy in the picture have different mothers.  (but neither of the moms are anywhere close to the children) The girl looks beautiful though.  </p>

			<p>If for no other reason, immigration must be stopped to save American television!  If the networks give the masses what they want we will be overrun with &#8220;novelas&#8221; and stupid variety shows 24X7.  Seriously, have you ever watched foreign TV?  To say it sucks is to praise it.</p>
<p>I remember an episode of &#8220;The Simpons&#8221; when Homer and Burns stole the $1 trillion dollar bill (or maybe it was a billion, no matter).  They escaped to Cuba by airplane with the FBI giving chase.  The FBI stopped at the edge of US airspace and turned around.  One of the agents stated, and I paraphrase, &#8220;They&rsquo;ll be back.  They always come back.  They&rsquo;ll miss American television.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Robert,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem. People don&rsquo;t believe this forecast. That&rsquo;s why Whites will be a minority. Forecasting population trends is not like forecasting the economy or the weather. People live a certain number of years to live and have a certain number of children Non-Whites have more children than Whites. Immigrants have more children than the domestic population. Most immigrants are non-white. Its just simple numbers is all.</p>

			<p>  Turn off the TV set and read a book or watch a DVD. I only watch the news and some PBS television. Today&rsquo;s Television has sunk to the level of mental masturbation. If minorities want to waste their time watching it, so be it.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing from the report that I found most surprising:</p>
<p>&#8220;Compared to Total U.S., African-American households are more<br>
likely to have Cable Plus with Pay and Wired Digital Cable. As<br>
depicted in the table, 53% of all African-American households<br>
are Cable Plus with Pay, compared to 49% of Total U.S., and 44%<br>
are Digital Wired Cable homes, compared to 40% of Total U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cable Plus with Pay means channels like HBO or Showtime for which one must pay a premium. Digital Cable is an extra charge, too. So blacks, who statistically have a lower income, are spending more money on watching TV.<br>

			<p>I just canceled my basic cable, after going through yet another disgusting Black History Month.  Like Sardonicus, I would only watch the news and PBS, and with the increasingly depressing news I&rsquo;ve watched less and less since the election.  But even then, turning on the TV in February to watch those two stations (news and PBS) 8 times out of 10, there would be something pertaining to Black history, and how wonderful Blacks are.  </p>
<p>So, now I just have my books and the Internet, too.  One day they will take the Internet away from us - might want to invest in a ham radio, so we can still communicate with like minded Whites.</p>

<p>Very true when I was going to high school I walk down the street to my friends house. He lived in a poor neighborhood and his house didnt look to good. He came from a single parent household, but in his house he had a big screen tv, surround sound, a DVD collection about the size of a book shelf, xbox, playstation, gameboys, psp&rsquo;s, and other electronic appliances. His mother had a job (dont know what) but it always made me wonder why she didnt save up that money to leave for a better place. It just goes to show where BLACKS put their priorities just as this article does.</p>

			<p>Interesting article, but I&rsquo;ve got to add my tuppence here.<br>
As mentioned by some other posters, TV viewing is no longer on the agenda for me, either.  It&rsquo;s been replaced by more productive activities.<br>
What a difference it makes!  Your thinking clears up and you feel mentally sharper.  </p>

			<p>Whites will be a minority in our own country by 2020! Thirty years different from the same people who claim there are still only twelve million illegals here,which if you looked back they were making this estimate over 10 yrs ago.</p>

<p>I believe that it certainly is a possiblity that non-whites could be the majority in this country however, &#8220;Robert&#8221; is right that it is not possible if or when this could or would happen as a lot can change between now and 2050. This depends on a lot of factors. For example,  non-white countries could start to do better economically which could halt or reverse immigration if or when globalization sinks or equalizes the West with developing countries. </p>

			<p>Hispanics tend not to watch the NFL games. So why is the NFL wasting money trying to get Hispanics interested in the NFL? With a couple of exceptions, like Jeff Garcia, Tom Flores and Anthony Munoz, Hispanics have never made much of an impact in the NFL. Most of them were placekickers, because they kicked the football soccer-style - which was a big deal back in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>Yet another Friday evening just passed without any TV.  My wife sewed herself another dress for work (she can get casual clothing inexpensively at girls&rsquo; &#8220;back-to-school&#8221; sales, good office clothes are expensive in her size in the US) while I finished up a welding job for one of the neighbors and then bottled the latest batch of apple-lemon honey mead.</p>
<p>It sure beat watching a half-hour sitcom with canned laughter or even a &#8220;survivor&#8221; show in which the lead Survivordingbat does not know that cat-tail roots and all parts of the dandelion are edible.</p>
