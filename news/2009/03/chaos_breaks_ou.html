<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pandemonium erupted outside an &#8220;America&rsquo;s Next Top Model&#8221; casting call in midtown yesterday when an overheating car triggered a stampede of catwalk-craving cuties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The audition for the show on The CW, which for the first time was open only to women under 5-feet-7, was doomed from the start, several said.</p>
<p>Scores of aspiring models slept overnight outside the Park Central Hotel, hoping to be the first to sashay before the hit show&rsquo;s casting agents.</p>
<p>But shortly after the sun rose, women began arriving and lining up indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Tensions quickly boiled over.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cops arrived and placed barricades along the street. But by that point, there were already several thousand women lined up. A handful of women started fainting after getting pressed up against the wall, witnesses said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A fight broke out between two men who had been taunting each other for several hours, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Cops intervened and pulled the men off the line. One of them threatened to return with a gun, heightening tensions among the already-frazzled women.</p>
<p>Soon after, a black BMW with smoke pouring out of its hood pulled up in the street near the line, sending the sea of underdressed women scrambling to get away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A total of six women were injured, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the wake of the stampede, cops arrested three people: Clem Clemmons, 40; Vanessa Quiones, 20, and Michael Edwards, 24. All were charged with inciting a riot.</p>
<p>A CW spokesman referred requests for comment to a CBS rep who did not return phone calls or e-mails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>For me, the more shocking story is why a BMW  &mdash;  -normally an excellent car  &mdash;  -would be spewing black smoke.  For the photo, it looks as if it&rsquo;s leaking coolant.</p>

			<p>Well thanks to Tyra (who I saw on TV the other day and boy has she packed on the pounds) the sistas have a good chance to show the world how all that they are. I saw this show once and they had like a faceoff between a real pretty white girl and an African and&hellip;guess who was sent home.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to a NY blog site that has video and pithy comments:</p>

			<p>Is anybody surprised by either.. A) the bad behaviour of the crowd. B) The race of the crowd. or C) The omission of the MSM in mentioning B.</p>
<p> This reminds me of a little while ago at a Wal-Mart store where a black employee was stomped to death by a black crowd and the media never once mentioned the race of the crowd.</p>

			<p>Speaking of, I have always wondered about that Tyra Banks.  She once had a daytime TV talk show Oprah-like, and I happened to be in a hospital waiting room and the TV had her show on, this was during its first season, a couple of episodes in.</p>
<p>The gist of the show that day was that she was showing obese and unattractive women how to have higher self-esteem.  Here you go, Tyra Banks made a living out of being thin and (in the opinion of enough people) attractive, and she&rsquo;s telling fat and ugly women how to feel good.  Not the fount of moral authority, por favor.</p>

			<p>Lot of ugly women in the pictures linked to the original article. Being stampeded on could only help their chances in the model search.</p>

			<p>Tyra Banks and her show is a joke. She CONSTANTLY claims to be &#8220;a proud black woman&#8221; but goes out of her way to look White! Conpare a picture of her to a native African woman. Case closed!!</p>

			<p> I read the article abot this yesterday. And <br>
immediatly a certain race of population came<br>
to mind, due to the typical behavior they repeatedly<br>
display. The &#8220;guess the race game&#8221; is becoming too <br>
easy.  blacks just keep creating the same chaos over<br>
and over. No matter how much our censored newsmedia<br>
tries to hide the race of the perpetrators. They can<br>
never cover up typical black behavior. It&rsquo;s on obvious<br>
display everywhere.<br>

			<p>Several thousand black women think they are going to be America&rsquo;s next top model?</p>
<p>They certainly don&rsquo;t lack a high opinion of themselves.</p>

			<p>Black folk just looking for a place to riot.  Supposedly someone yelled, &#8220;there&rsquo;s a bomb&#8221; when the Bimmer pulled up.  Actually, in the Black folk&rsquo;s &#8220;street lingo&#8221;, &#8220;&#8216;da bomb&#8221; means that something is desirable, like a black BMW, with or without an overheating engine.  What probably was said was &#8220;dat car&rsquo;s &#8216;da bomb&#8221; and the &#8220;models&#8221;, acting like the sheeple that they are, panicked.  </p>

			<p>I saw footage of this on CNN, but never did they get close enough  for the viewer to show what race the rioters were. No surprise there.</p>

			<p>You think people in this country don&rsquo;t already get it.  Put a swarm and/or mob of blacks in close proximity of each other and there are bound to be problems.  I&rsquo;ve seen it when I USED to go to amusement parks.  They can&rsquo;t stand in line like everybody else and wait their turn.  They jump over the bars, they allow people (their friends) or jump the line even though it is clearly stated that the park will eject anybody jumping a line for a ride.  That&rsquo;s why my family and I avoid any park that is in close proxmity to any large city.  We prefer to stay with the more rural parks, like Hershey and Dollywood, which have so far, not been overrun yet with mobs of blacks.  As soon as the metal detectors went up at Kings Dominion and Carowinds, we stopped going there. Somehow a metal detector and people searching your bags and purses at an amusement park, just takes the fun out of it.  The reason for the metal detectors is because a few years ago, a man took a gun into Kings Dominion and shot it off in the park.</p>
<p>Sooner than later, the streets of America will resemble what we see happening in predominantly black countries.  See the movie Tears of the Sun, the beginning, you can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s an American city or not.</p>

<p>Also the opening scenes of &#8220;BlackHawk Down&#8221; looks like any welfare office in the U.S.</p>
