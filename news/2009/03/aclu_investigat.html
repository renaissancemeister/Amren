<h1><a href="http://www.argusleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090302/NEWS/903020305&amp;s=a">ACLU Investigates Fire Rescue Hiring</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Gruchow, Argus Leader (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), March 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Sioux Falls office of the American Civil Liberties Union has opened an inquiry into the recruitment and hiring practices of the city&rsquo;s fire department, which has only two minority firefighters out of 178 on the force.</p>
<p>The civil rights agency is trying to determine whether Sioux Falls Fire Rescue&rsquo;s procedures have led to a disparity in minority employees, its Sioux Falls-based lawyer said this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the fire department says its recruitment and hiring policies are highly structured and controlled in order to hire the most qualified applicants and to minimize the potential for ethnic prejudice and discrimination.</p>
<p>City human resources officials who administer the firefighter testing and conduct the interviews say they have sound, transparent polices that do not take ethnicity into consideration. And Sioux Falls Fire Rescue Chief Donn Hill said the department tries to incorporate minorities both as department recruiters and as potential employees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ACLU began its investigation after learning about the case of Jamie Hamley, a 33-year-old member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians who had applied to the department only to fail an oral communications test and was disqualified.</p>
<p>Hamley, college educated and with previous firefighting experience and training, said he saw a younger, less educated and experienced white colleague advance to the next phase of testing. Then, on April 19, 2006, Hamley filed a discrimination charge with the South Dakota Division of Human Rights. It was dismissed Jan. 1, 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That disparity exists in part because of the low turnover in the department, which slows how the demographics of the department change from year to year, Hill said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the people that start at the department retire from the department,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it&rsquo;ll take a long time before the department would begin to match the makeup of the larger community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fire department&rsquo;s application and testing process includes a written examination, physical abilities tests, behavioral assessments, credit check, oral interview and psychiatric exam.</p>
<p>An applicant must pass every test to move on in the hiring process, where sometimes fractions of a point allow applicants to be disqualified, Hill said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But firefighting experience and training are not taken into consideration during the hiring process, because new firefighters are put through standardized department training, Hill said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We train all of our firefighters as if they had no experience,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<p>Ironically, oral interviews are usually the quasi-substantive rationale for affirmative action hiring and promotion.</p>

			<p>If 176 out of 178 firefighters in Sioux Falls are white, one must wonder what the ethnic population balance is there.  I would bet that it is overwhelmingly white, with the balance made up of Amerinds, who are more likely to have past legal troubles that would make them ineligible to work on a fire department or police force.</p>

<p>It seems like every non-white in these situations has a tale of the White Fool who - despite having an I.Q. below 60, was blind and deaf without the use of his hands - managed to get hired or promoted instead of the non-white <i>ubermensch</i>:<br>
Just like how every black American <i>knows</i> that &#8220;racism is thriving in American society now&#8221; and&hellip;has never experience a <i>single</i> racist occurrence in their life.</p>

			<p> According to ePodunk.com, a site with detailed information about all 50 states and all the cities and towns in them, Sioux Falls&rsquo; population of about 123,000 is 91.9 percent White; 1.8 percent black; 2.1 percent Indian; and 2.5 percent Latino. I don&rsquo;t know where this &#8220;increasing diversity&#8221; they talked about came from, but this sounds like the kind of ginned-up controversy the ACLU loves to create.</p>
<p> If the police department is 3 percent minority as the article said, then it&rsquo;s got a larger percentage of non-Whites than any of the principal groups of them in the population. Just two out of 178 on the fire-rescue department is 1 percent, true; but what&rsquo;s that got to do with the price of tea in China? Can the ACLU prove that there was any deliberate discrimination against the non-White applicants? Or   &mdash;   which is much more likely   &mdash;   could they just not &#8220;cut the mustard&#8221;?</p>

			<p>A college degree is no real indication of an ability to communicate orally, read fluently, or multiply 23X47 without a calculator.  All educated people know that.  </p>

			<p>On a related note. I have a friend who has been with a local volunteer fire dept. for a good quarter century now. Although this area is increasingly filled with non-whites galore, he informs me that to the best of his recollection, he cannot recall more than perhaps one or two Non-Wites EVER volunteering(let alone sticking around, etc.) to join the company in all the time he has been there. To the day, the dept. remains overwhelmingly White, aging and often short-staffed. They would likely welcome any help&hellip;but Non-Whites do not seem remotely interested. What a surprise&hellip;</p>

			<p>ACLU mascarades as defenders of Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>What they are doing is, in fact, quite different.</p>
<p>They are looking for any kind of weapon against white/conservative/Christian America that can be mischaracterized as means of defense of the U.S. constitution.</p>
<p>And then they attack us with that weapon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very typical of anti-American Left.<br>

			<p>I only have a master&rsquo;s degree in linguistics, yet failed an oral interview for a small-town Sheriff&rsquo;s Department once while living in a place where jobs were scarce. It just wasn&rsquo;t my field, and I would have made a lousy cop even though I aced the fitness and multiple choice written exams.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have sued for discrimination against smart people&hellip;</p>
<p>As far as fire departments go, I&rsquo;d rather have guys who can put fires out expeditiously than worry about &#8220;diversity&#8221;. Hire enough minorities, especially blacks, and all anybody does is stand around arguing about who be preeej-dist while the job goes undone.</p>

			<p>Articles like this do nothing but report how completely ridiculous the business of race-hustling has become. </p>
<p>The ACLU is nothing short of racially-motivated ambulance chasers who seem to feel that only they know how life should be lived&hellip;and it&rsquo;s up to the rest of us to comply. </p>
<p>Here in Baltimore, about three years ago, the City Fire Department seated a class of all-white firefighter recruits. The city, which is majority black, erupted in fury. </p>
<p>The City Fire Chief, a well-respected veteran, held a press conference where he said that the department&rsquo;s racially blind hiring process had failed. Then they went out and hired six black recruits in less than a week, somehow shortening a months-long hiring process. </p>
<p>I never could find a way to understand that a racially blind process had failed&hellip;if it paid no attention to race, then wasn&rsquo;t it in strict compliance with the Civil Rights Act? And wouldn&rsquo;t hiring minorities based on their race then be in violation of it?</p>
<p>How do we, as intelligent members of society, continue to silently accept these childish inversions of logic? How is it that beyond those of us here on AmRen, the average white American passively accepts this obvious pseudo-intellectual sleight-of-hand?</p>
<p>I hate to keep saying the same thing over and over, especially in a forum of like-minded people, but when will we ever realize that minorities are nothing special? They&rsquo;re just people, the same as everyone else. Period. </p>
<p>Why do we continue to elevate them to almost god-like levels of undeserved privelege?</p>

			<p>The quota of non-white firemen everywhere in America or any other job in this white-European Cultured country, should be reflective of our &#8221; Founding Fathers&rsquo; &#8221; racial composition.</p>

			<p>Any merit based hiring practices will result in racial and ethnic disparities.  Let&rsquo;s investigate the ACLU and see if they have an excess of Jews (which, last I checked, were heavily overrepresented in the legal profession, especially the liberal end of it).  When the ACLU comes out in favor of quotas to limit Jewish employment in law, medicine, academia, media, and finance, at least I&rsquo;ll acknowledge that they are consistent, although I still won&rsquo;t agree with their position.</p>

			<p>I have no problem with equal opportunity, but I&rsquo;m against forcing an equal outcome.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t matter what the racial makeup is, so long as the people there are the best-qualified to perform that task.  If it&rsquo;s all white, so be it.  If it&rsquo;s all black, so be it.  If it&rsquo;s mostly Amerind and Oriental, so be it.  So long as they can do the job correctly, that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>I guess some people don&rsquo;t want to admit any shortcomings.</p>
