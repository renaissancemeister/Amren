<h1><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB123682571772404053.html">Waters Helped Bank Whose Stock She Once Owned</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Schmidt, Wall Street Journal, March 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Rep. Barney Frank was looking to aid a Boston-based lender last fall, the Massachusetts Democrat urged Maxine Waters, a colleague on the House Financial Services Committee, to &#8220;stay out of it,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The reason: Ms. Waters, a longtime congresswoman from California, had close ties to the minority-owned institution, OneUnited Bank.</p>
<p>Ms. Waters and her husband have both held financial stakes in the bank. Until recently, her husband was a director. At the same time, Ms. Waters has publicly boosted OneUnited&rsquo;s executives and criticized its government regulators during congressional hearings. Last fall, she helped secure the bank a meeting with Treasury officials.</p>
<p>Her involvement isn&rsquo;t new. Ms. Waters has detailed her financial ties in a series of federal disclosure forms and has been vocal in public in support of the bank. Those ties, however, have received little public attention. Nor is it well known how the influential lawmaker has over the years acted to support the bank and its executives.</p>
<p>{snip} The financial-services committee on which Ms. Waters sits oversees banking issues, and the lawmaker is a potential future chairman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Waters, who represents inner-city Los Angeles, hasn&rsquo;t made a secret of her family&rsquo;s financial interest in OneUnited. Referring to her family&rsquo;s investment, she said in 2007 during a congressional hearing that for African-Americans, &#8220;the test of your commitment to economic expansion and development and support for business is whether or not you put your money where your mouth is.&#8221;</p>
<p>OneUnited&rsquo;s executives have donated $12,500 to Ms. Waters&rsquo;s election campaigns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Waters and her husband, Sidney Williams, were investors in two African-American owned California banks that merged with other lenders in 2002 to form OneUnited. Congressional financial-disclosure forms show Ms. Waters acquired OneUnited stock worth between $250,000 and $500,000 in March 2004, as did Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams joined the board of OneUnited that year.</p>
<p>Each sold shares in September 2004  &mdash;  including Ms. Waters&rsquo;s entire stake  &mdash;  but Mr. Williams continued to hold varying amount of the company&rsquo;s stock. In the lawmaker&rsquo;s most recent financial-disclosure form, dated May 2008 and covering the prior year, Ms. Waters reported that her husband held between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of the bank&rsquo;s stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams also received interest payments from a separate holding at the bank, also worth between $250,000 and $500,000. The 2008 form doesn&rsquo;t specify what that is. Mr. Williams stepped down from the bank&rsquo;s board last spring. {snip}</p>
<p>At a hearing on minority lending in 2007, Ms. Waters criticized regulators for not doing enough to help minority banks stave off mergers with non-minority institutions. {snip}</p>
<p>In her 2007 remarks, Ms. Waters alluded to two banks, Independence Bank of Washington, D.C., and &#8220;another bank that was about to be acquired by a major white bank out of Illinois.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Waters didn&rsquo;t mention that OneUnited had been an unsuccessful suitor of Independence, which had been taken over several years earlier. The second bank, which she didn&rsquo;t name, appears to have been Family Savings Bank of Los Angeles. In 2002, that bank backed out of a merger agreement with FBOP Bank of Oak Brook, Ill., and shortly afterward was acquired by OneUnited.</p>
<p>News reports at the time credited the intervention of Ms. Waters and others for Family Savings&rsquo;s change of heart.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OneUnited&rsquo;s minority-lending record is mixed. The bank received &#8220;outstanding&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act ratings for lending in Los Angeles. It has weak ratings in Massachusetts and failed to meet minimum standards in Florida.</p>
<p>In January, Ms. Waters acknowledged she made a call to the Treasury on OneUnited&rsquo;s behalf. The bank&rsquo;s capital, which was heavily invested in shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was all but wiped out with the federal takeover of the two mortgage giants, and the bank was seeking help from regulators.</p>
<p>OneUnited eventually secured bailout funds under the government&rsquo;s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was set up later that month.</p>
<p>In a brief interview in January, Ms. Waters said she was unaware the bank received $12 million of TARP money, which arrived in December. OneUnited was &#8220;just a small&#8221; bank, she said.</p>

			<p>Why are the black owned banks really small?  Gateway Bank, the one in St. Louis, had only like $20 million of assets as late as ten years ago.</p>
<p>Maxine Waters is a St. Louis native, BTW.  Accept my apologies for my native city foisting this embarrassment onto the American body politic.</p>

<p>This is so pathetic&hellip;.I still cannot fathom how this woman and others like her became representative in the U.S Congress&hellip;&hellip;America is beginning to look more like a free for all banana republic with all these stories coming out&hellip;.it is a total disgrace. </p>

			<p>I hope everyone here has seen Ms. Waters performance at a 2004 congressional hearing involving the head regulator for the GSE&rsquo;s fannie mae and freddie  mac. At this hearing she and her fellow blak democrats along with barney frank attacked the head regulator for daring to expose the fraud at the GSE&rsquo;s. They defended the practice of giving loans to unqualified minorities (read blaks) and told him to back off. It&rsquo;s hard to believe someone as corrupt and unqualified as Ms. Waters is in such a powerful position, she can give Chuck Rangel a run for our money! These same people are in charge of the banking committee today.</p>

			<p>yea, that&rsquo;s just sad that she&rsquo;ll never be investigated. funny how she&rsquo;d be all up in the grill of any republican the least bit accused of any impropriety.  too bad the republicans didn&rsquo;t do their jobs and throw her awful butt out of congress when they were in the leadership.  the republicans are spineless and will never be back in power.</p>

			<p>Folks, for those of you who do not live in or near the Los Angeles area, I have to tell you Maxine Waters is one of the most corrupt and vile Congresswomen there has ever been. I could write a small book on the things I have read about her for over twenty years. She literally uses her black constituents and keeps them in poverty just so she stays in power.</p>

			<p>It is well that Maxine Waters is an embarrassment to the Congress.  If she were better behaved she&rsquo;d be more dangerous.  I&rsquo;d much prefer that our adversaries be petty and venal, rather that respectable and principled.  </p>

			<p>Nothing will touch this woman, she is a protected species, she is aware that she can do or say anything. The most powerful voting bloc in congress is the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>

<p>Whoa! They rate banks on minority-lending! It must have been a part of the so-called &#8220;deregulation&#8221;. With this kind of blatant pressure to lend to the &#8220;underqualified&#8221; there is no doubt why did the housing market collapse last year.</p>

<p>Posted by Bobby</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding (and great post, BTW).</p>
<p>Not only that, this &#8216;corrupt and vile&rsquo; (don&rsquo;t forget hypocritical and racist) congresswoman has been given pass after pass after pass by the local yellow rags  &mdash;  indeed by the national biased press as well because she is a protected. She doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to excoriate (what she calls) &#8216;the White press&rsquo; whenever they (rightly) criticize black politicians.</p>
<p>For example (from Larry Elder&rsquo;s Letter to Maxine Waters):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;you wrote a letter to Janet Reno to back off of a joint federal joint Justice Department local DEA probe. The probe centered on James A. Prince, a childhood friend of your husband&rsquo;s. The authorities suspected him of drug trafficking, and some DEA agents working on the probe suddenly got yanked off. Some, on the record, accused you of interfering with a legitimate probe&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In 1979, former Black Panther, Joanne Chesimard, gunned down a New Jersey State Highway Patrol Officer&hellip;.In a daring breakout, Chesimard escaped from prison and fled to Cuba&hellip;You wrote Castro a letter, urging him to let her stay, stating &#8216;she was persecuted as a result of her political beliefs and affiliations.&rsquo; You further likened her to Martin Luther King!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.larryelder.com/showpostings/maxinewaters.htm</p>
<p>Or as Michelle Malkin writes about her:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;[Waters]&hellip;is one of the most self-serving, hate-filled, race-obsessed politicians in America. The Democratic Party doesn&rsquo;t just embrace her. It kneels at her feet&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I would add the MSM as well.</p>
