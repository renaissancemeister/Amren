<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is it racist for white people to shoot black zombies?</p>
<p>This Friday, Capcom&rsquo;s new release &#8220;Resident Evil 5,&#8221; from producer Jun Takeuchi, broaches that question. The franchise, which first launched in 1996, has sold more than 12 million units and earned nearly a half billion dollars in revenue, according to research firm NPD Group. It&rsquo;s even been spun into a modestly successful film trilogy starring Milla Jovovich. The latest entry in the series follows Chris Redfield, the hero of the first game, as he tracks the cause of a deadly virus plaguing villages in West Africa.</p>
<p>{snip} [Now] that the game is facing an official release, it has spurred a new debate about race in videogames.</p>
<p>Opponents of the new game will have plenty of ammunition. Although there are Arab zombies in &#8220;Resident Evil 5,&#8221; the majority of the undead are Africans. As a player, you are often forced to use a machete to hack your way through your attackers, using the same kind of weapons that were used in atrocities in places like Rwanda and the Congo over the last two decades. Killing African zombies can earn you gold treasure  &mdash;  in addition to the loot you find in barrels and vases in the different African villages. And while Chris&rsquo;s partner, Sheva Alomar, is from the region, she&rsquo;s light-skinned with straight-hair, and is introduced to players during a cinematic sequence highlighting not her face, but rather, her rear end.</p>
<p>Mary Flanagan, a professor of digital media at Dartmouth College, argues that the fact that the game&rsquo;s zombies are of color is a significant detail. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not to say we can&rsquo;t allow for transgression, but there are so few depictions of Africans in games,&#8221; she says. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Kramer [says Chris Kramer, a spokesman for Capcom] also contends that Americans are more sensitive about issues of race in the wake of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s election. &#8220;There are probably some cultural awareness levels that are not there [for Japanese developers],&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is the dearth of people of color in the videogame industry as a whole. {snip} One attendee joked that there were more black journalists covering the industry than non-white members of the industry itself.</p>
<p>The main characters in videogames are not particularly diverse either. There have been exceptions; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some games have chosen to give players more control over their player&rsquo;s appearance. In last year&rsquo;s popular action role-playing game &#8220;Fallout 3,&#8221; players are allowed to choose their ethnicity and are given a set of tools to customize their character&rsquo;s facial features. {snip}</p>
<p>To be clear, &#8220;Resident Evil 5&#8221; is not a game about killing Africans. Your job, as a player, is to save villages that have been victimized by a biochemical terrorist group. The first fearsome opponent you face is a blonde-haired female and you are rescued several times by another troupe of African soldiers. And ultimately, the game suggests that the barbarism depicted in the game is a result of your enemies&rsquo; zombieness, not their African identity. In short, Africans don&rsquo;t beat you to death with their hands  &mdash;  zombies do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But discussions about colonialism are only dealt with obliquely in the game  &mdash;  Chris never reflects on his position as a white male in Africa nor does he discuss race with his African partner, Sheva. The game presents only one option to survive against African zombies: kill every single one.<br>

			<p>Mark me:  There is going to be more whining about this game than there ever was about many of the versions of Grand Theft Auto, where your gameplay is the kill, rob and steal.  I suppose the most controversial game is going to be one where voting Republican is part of the gameplay.</p>

			<p><i>Is it racist for white people to shoot black zombies?</i></p>
<p>Is it &#8220;racist&#8221; for whites to do anything or be in any situation where non-whites aren&rsquo;t portrayed as immaculate, god-like beings?</p>
<p><i>As a player, you are often forced to use a machete to hack your way through your attackers, using the same kind of weapons that were used in atrocities in places like Rwanda and the Congo over the last two decades</i></p>
<p><i>The main characters in videogames are not particularly diverse either. There have been exceptions</i></p>
<p>Which race forms the majority of video-game consumers?<br>
Question: <i>Who</i> were committing the genocides then?<br>
What about the other Resident Evil games - surely it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; for the varied (apparently white) protagonists to use pistols on white zombies - shades of the Holocaust anyone?</p>
<p><i> And ultimately, the game suggests that the barbarism depicted in the game is a result of your enemies&rsquo; zombieness, not their African identity. In short, Africans don&rsquo;t beat you to death with their hands &mdash; zombies do.</i></p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;d played a single Resident Evil game at least once in their life could tell Captain Clueless here that <i>that&rsquo;s what the enemies ARE and DO in these games!</i> - finding such inane levels of &#8220;racism&#8221; in this game is both hilarious and silly.</p>
<p><i>But discussions about colonialism are only dealt with obliquely in the game &mdash; Chris never reflects on his position as a white male in Africa nor does he discuss race with his African partner, Sheva.</i></p>
<p>Yes, because teenaged white males are just <i>begging</i> for a chance to be harangued about how &#8220;they&#8221;, and not Africans themselves, are responsible for the fact that Western-style governments and civilisation are floundering in Africa</p>
<p><i>The game presents only one option to survive against African zombies: kill every single one.</i></p>
<p>So the developers are staying true to the Resident Evil genre then?</p>
<p>Seriously, I love these tales of phantom &#8220;racism&#8221;</p>

			<p>I assume we all know the fallacy of the following statement. </p>
<p>&#8220;In short, Africans don&rsquo;t beat you to death with their hands &mdash; zombies do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d beg to differ. </p>
<p>Anyway, here again we have the nonsensical whining from the usual suspects. The PC police must be cringing with this one.</p>
<p>As ive said long before on this site, im a gamer. First off, id like to say.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the PC rejects over at wall street journal speak about this game as if they know whats going on. Even if it&rsquo;s to defend it from racism accusations in their own groveling PC way. </p>
<p>As you can tell by the name of the producer and from the article itself. This is a Japanese made game. For a long time in the gaming industry, virtually all games were Japanese made.</p>
<p>This is the single reason why political correctness has been so slow to slither its way into this entertainment medium, like it has everything else. The Japanese do not live under the PC rule. Thier media, including the games we get from them, show this.</p>
<p>As time has went on, there are more and more western developed games.. Political Correctness is slowly working its way in. Its sad really. The days of games with predominantly dashing white heroes, like western movies once held in high regard, may be coming to a close. Well, if the japanese give into Politically correct mantra that is. </p>
<p>I can only hope games like this, that is, games created without diversity zealots governing their actions, continue to run. The blacks may not like their fair representation in the gaming industry right now. It may anger them they aren&rsquo;t depicted as righteous smart alleck heroes, the anti-thesis to the &#8220;dumb white villain&#8221; like they are in our movies. But it&rsquo;s not so far from the reality of the situation is it?</p>
<p>Blacks are afraid of the reality of their violence. </p>
<p>In any case, i look forward to picking this title up tomorrow. Got a pre-order and everything.</p>
<p>Let the accusations fly!</p>

			<p>Are the zombies that much different from the soulless black predators that kill whites so frequently in America&rsquo;s cities?</p>
<p>The character shouldn&rsquo;t have to reflect on being a white male in Africa. African-Americans certainly never reflect much on the fact they they should not be in the West. They complain constantly about how they got here but never once reflect on the fact that they are in an alien civilization where they will never prosper.</p>

			<p>I think the effect if not the intent of these games is to keep White kids isolated, out of shape and incapable of forming cliques with their own kind. Meanwhile, Black and Brown kids are getting together on the corner like we used to and need to again&hellip;</p>

			<p>The developers had to be ready for this one, so don&rsquo;t expect them to do much cringing.</p>
<p>Someone in-house probably mentioned the fact that EVERY ZOMBIE, EVER, has been white.</p>
<p>Is that racist?  Is it racist for multiracial bands of heroes to shoot hordes of exclusively-white zombies?</p>
<p>Kind of sad that a Japanese company is more attuned to white ethnic interests (even if by accident) than any of our American companies (Just try to find a PC video game capitalizing on 9/11; there are two (two!  BF2 &amp; CoD4) that I know of - millions of dollars in revenue forgone in the service of political correctness).</p>
<p><i>Mary Flanagan, a professor of digital media at Dartmouth College, argues that the fact that the game&rsquo;s zombies are of color is a significant detail. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to say we can&rsquo;t allow for transgression, but there are so few depictions of Africans in games,&rdquo; she says.</i></p>
<p>A dodge, Miz FLANAGAN.  Nobody is talking about Africans (some of whom are of European, east Asian, south Asian, etc., ancestry).  We&rsquo;re talking about race.  See, she&rsquo;s lying (playing bait-and-switch between race and continent of residence) because she knows perfectly well that blacks are well-represented amongst video game protagonists - over-represented, if anything.</p>
<p><i>Part of the problem is the dearth of people of color in the videogame industry as a whole.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a &#8220;problem&#8221; that game dev studios have to hire based on competence.</p>
<p><i>One attendee joked that there were more black journalists covering the industry than non-white members of the industry itself.</i></p>
<p>How is this a joke?  Blacks are eminently qualified for journalism.  This is not true of game development, unless you count mocap actors or PR or something.</p>
<p>Game companies are almost as slavishly subservient to political correctness as Hollywood.  I was happy to find a wild west game for the PC recently, only to discover to my chagrin that the protagonist is half-mestizo, with a chip on his shoulder, an anti-white narrative, and evil racist white villains to boot.  And this is from a Czech company!</p>

<p>Not really. The browns and blacks are just as interested if not more. Only they turn to more shallow games, such as GTA (ones more often than not made by the west). Its simply another entertainment medium, no more diabolical at the base level than any other entertainment device, like cinema. White kids are getting out just as much id say. </p>
<p>Its when these entertainment mediums get used by the powers that be as yet another tool of propaganda, that it truly becomes something to be rejected. That hasn&rsquo;t yet happened to gaming in its entirety. </p>
<p>Its my opinion that the PC police (MSM) don&rsquo;t like which they don&rsquo;t have full control over. The evidence speaks for itself. </p>

			<p> Will these idiots ever shut up ?! Resident Evil 4 took<br>
place in rural Spain, so the zombies were&hellip; Spanish. And <br>
since Spaniards reside in Spain, the Spaniards who were <br>
infected with the virus became zombies. I don&rsquo;t remember<br>
the PC tards complaining then. Who else is supposed to<br>
turn into zombies in black Africa ? Whites ? Asians ? <br>
Arabs ? Hindus ? Jews ? Anyone as long as they&rsquo;re not<br>
black ?</p>
<p> Political Correctness even ruins accuracy in gaming<br>
plots as well.</p>

			<p>Was the movie &#8220;I Am Legend&#8221; racist since the protagonist was played by Will Smith, a black, and his &#8220;evil&#8221; adversaries were white? If not, then I don&rsquo;t see how one could say this game is racist either. </p>

  That is racist!!!, but then you have a motion picture hit &#8220;I AM LEGEND&#8221; Where the hero is a courageous Black man and the evil blood suckers of the world are these ultra Whites. Second the story doesnt even follow the original and completely makes the title of the movie irrelevant.</p>
<p>So moral of the story Americas knight in shinning armor is the black man that struggles the evil White race&hellip;.. But you cant kill black zombies because well&hellip; that&rsquo;s racist!</p>

<p>But wait a minute - the lead character in Night of the Living Dead was a black man. He was a hero in the film. Does that mean George Romero will be forgiven?</p>

			<p>Generation gap city?  This is when the USA started losing out in every way, when the young started wasting their youth with these useless &#8220;video games&#8221;.  To me, these things are utterly indefensible &amp; beneath contempt.  Even more stupifying than any drug addiction.  Reading Archie comics would be a better way to waste one&rsquo;s precious time.</p>
<p>P.S.  I&rsquo;m 50 y.o.;  so I saw the evolution of these things from pinball, pong, space invaders, pacman, atari, etc.</p>

<p>Oh, I highly doubt that.  The idea of White Americans fighting off a never-ending horde of Black &#8220;zombies&#8221; is a metaphor not lost on racially-aware Japan.  I&rsquo;m sure many laughs at Multicult America&rsquo;s expense were had while making this game.</p>

<p>Far from the truth. There will always be mediums of entertainment people go to. Always. It has indeed evolved as time has gone on and technology improved. But it and unto itself is not an evil. You simply reject that which you yourself don&rsquo;t understand or is foreign to you. </p>
<p>To so much as feel contempt for someone engaging in the activity is one of blind conviction. Refer to my previous posts for more info, but this is far from a problem. Its who produces them with what content(PC or not PC), not what they are. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Reading Archie comics would be a better way to waste ones precious time.&#8221; -Cousin Charlie<br>
 My fondest memory of High School, along with an extra shot of  feel good neighborliness is this. I was a sixteen year old track letterman with a reputation for being a happy go lucky sort with no animosity towards anyone. One day a Military transfer student was assigned the seat behind me. She was extremely overweight and apparently did nothing but live vicariously thru an enormous stack of Archie comics she brought to school every day. <br>
  The other kids mocked her to her face about it which just drove her further and deeper into her shell. But not me. I LIKED Archie comics! Soon we struck up a sort of friendship. Whenever a new issue would arrive she would flip it onto my desk for my perusal. Betty and Veronica No.4, Jugheads Jokes and every Moose, Reggie and Mr. Weatherbee issue that ever hit the magazine racks. Then, one day without notice she was gone and soon forgotten. <br>
  The first day of school the next year, the hallways were abuzz with news of the hottest new  girl to ever hit this side of Salado Creek. She was skinnier than an Italian pistol and dressed like some kind of hot-rod party doll. The other guys crowded around her like a pony keg. When I walked in and saw her I was impressed. Our eyes met, then she waited until I took my seat and sat behind me. A minute late a lithe  suntanned wrist reached over my shoulder and handed me a copy of Betty and Veronica No.7 &#8220;Remember me?!?&#8221; she asked. She then went on to explain that her Lt. Colonel father had withdrawn her from school and enrolled her  in a spring thru summer fat camp. She lavished me with praise saying I was the only one who was ever nice to her, before asking me to take her to the first football game. I did and it was like getting to date the real Betty. She got transferred again about six months later but four decades on I think of her and the power of a kind word when ever I drive past the Comic Hut&hellip;</p>

			<p>Bannister, fellow NOTLD fan here.  Romero always has subtle political statements in his films, however, I think even he probably thinks this so-called controversy is ridiculous.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hypocracy at its best  &mdash;  if this was a black man mowing down European-American zombies, these same people whining about &#8220;racism&#8221; would be silent as a tomb.  It&rsquo;s this double-standard that infuriates me.</p>

			<p>As an avid gamer, I have been aware of this story for quite a while.  When it was announced that RE 5 would take place in Africa, there were cries of racism immediately.</p>
<p>I guess the fact that in Resident Evil 1-4 you killed white zombies was not a factor.  Truly unbelievable.</p>

Bring this up to a black person and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll tell you that it was a black man that invented the basement.</p>

<p>Said the guy who grew up on movies&hellip;am I right?  Video games are <i>inherently</i> better for you than movies - that&rsquo;s written into the medium.  Add to that the fact that they take far more technical expertise than film, so an ethnic clique can&rsquo;t take them over (which means they can&rsquo;t be politicized as effectively as movies), and I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re much better (or much less hazardous) for us than movies.</p>
<p>Obviously, reading is better than either&hellip;</p>
