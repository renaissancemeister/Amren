<h1>Police in Race Bias Outrage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dean Herbert, Scottish Daily Mail, February 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police in Scotland have been ordered to give special priority to crimes where the victims are Muslim.</p>
<p>In a move that last night sparked a fresh row over political correctness, a senior officer revealed that the race and religion of a victim has now become a crucial factor in how police respond to crime.</p>
<p>Inspector Tom Galbraith, of Lothian and Borders Police&rsquo;s diversity unit, told a conference on tackling terrorism that it was important to stop Scottish Muslims feeling &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; in case they were driven towards radicalism.</p>
<p>Mr. Galbraith said the force encouraged officers to consider the religious or ethnic backgrounds of victims to assess their needs in dealing with hate crimes.</p>
<p>He said that both an attack and a perceived lack of action by police could turn Islamic youths into future terrorists.</p>
<p>Mr. Galbraith also revealed that police officers, Special Branch and BAA security staff were being given special lessons about Islamic culture after Muslims complained that being questioned when entering the country about whether they pray and attend mosques was offensive to their faith.</p>
<p>Speaking at a national security conference in Edinburgh on Thursday, Mr. Galbraith said, &#8220;It is not about treating everybody the same.</p>
<p>If I have a young Asian man who has been subjected to a hate crime, I would rather put more resources into that than if it had happened to a white male because the white male is far less likely to end up becoming radicalised.&#8221;</p>
<p>He later confirmed that his remarks were in line with Lothian and Borders Police policy, saying that cases of hate crime were assessed &#8220;by need&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;You have to consider cases according to need.  The idea of treating people all the same is a bit naive and we have to remember that there are vulnerable individuals who can be put on the path of radicalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night, the police were criticised for being too politically correct in dealing with hate crimes.</p>
<p>Conservative Justice spokesman Bill Aitken said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m afraid we are now living in a society in which some people are more equal than others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not accepting assault against some people is a serious matter and the law is required to be proactive in each and every case.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no room for political correctness in the fight against crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Cook, Scottish spokesman for the Campaign Against Political Correctness, added: &#8220;I think people will be extremely concerned that victims are being treated differently according to their religion, colour of their skin and where they live.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the conference, Mr. Galbraith also said that police officers and airport security staff were being given lessons in Islamic culture to avoid offending arrivals.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Sometimes they will be asked &#8220;Do you pray?&#8221; or &#8220;Do you visit mosques?&#8221; when they arrive in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of thing is derogatory to the Islamic faith.  A lot of people then wonder what is wrong with going to mosques in this country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about making an effort in learning about other cultures and faiths.&#8221;</p>
<p>He later confirmed that training in Islamic culture was now on-going among officers.</p>
<p>Mr. Galbraith joined Lothian and Borders police in 1988.</p>
<p>He presently works in the diversity unit under the &#8220;prevent&#8221; strand of the UK counter-terrorism strategy.<br>

			<p>&#8220;a senior officer revealed that the race and religion of a victim has now become a crucial factor in how police respond to crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Welcome to our world over here on the other side of the pond</p>
<p>&#8220;Inspector Tom Galbraith&hellip; (said) it was important to stop Scottish Muslims feeling &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; in case they were driven towards radicalism&#8221;.</p>
<p>That was so funny! There&rsquo;s always an excuse. It doesn&rsquo;t have to stay the same over time, or even remain the same excuse in an exactly identical situation. Least of all does it need to make any sense at all. Just say it&rsquo;s a response to &#8216;racism&rsquo;. And say anyone who challenges your noble program, a racist. </p>
<p>I think I just described the last 50 years of Western History. It has definitely been a decline. At least we can be sure we&rsquo;re not racist. Except of course they still say that we are. Must be a lot more &#8216;progress&rsquo; that needs to be done.  </p>

<p>If they continue on with that policy, they&rsquo;re going to wish they hadn&rsquo;t.  I can guarantee it.</p>

			<p>The U.K. is the center of the &#8220;New World Order&#8221; It has to be, the stuff that has been going on their now for some years is too surreal. There is an agenda being served there, that I believe is not in the best interests of the traditional citizenry. Just like here in the U.S.</p>

			<p><i>In a move that last night sparked a fresh row over political correctness, a senior officer revealed that the race and religion of a victim has now become a crucial factor in how police respond to crime.</i></p>
<p>Reading about how the British police investigate &#8220;anti-white&#8221; hate crimes in the British National Party report the white <i>victim</i> is investigated to <i>see if they &#8220;provoked&#8221; the attacker</i>! (Just like the archetypal &#8220;Yes, the 5&rsquo;5&#8221; white teenaged girl shouted racial epithets at me and my group of six 20 year old black men &hellip;at midnight&hellip;on an empty street&#8221;) </p>
<p><i>If I have a young Asian man who has been subjected to a hate crime, I would rather put more resources into that than if it had happened to a white male because the white male is far less likely to end up becoming radicalised.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>But that white male may be inclined towards supporting an organisation like the BNP&hellip;so it&rsquo;s best to charge him with a hate crime and throw away the key.</p>
<p>Look&rsquo;s like sanity abandoned the Isles a long, long time ago.</p>

			<p>Galbraith is totally insulting! Don&rsquo;t use resources if the victim is white because he&rsquo;s not likely to become radicalized. What he&rsquo;s saying here is that whites are whimps; whites are tame; whites won&rsquo;t organize and whites won&rsquo;t fight back. But the absolute, most intolerable insult is that this Scottsman demonstrates no national solidarity and spits on his fellow white countrymen. What a traitor!&hellip;. More white warriors please.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;it was important to stop Scottish Muslims feeling &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; in case they were driven towards radicalism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If they feel &#8216;vulnerable&rsquo; living where they are, there are a myriad of muslim nations they can reside and not feel &#8216;vulnerable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As for feeling vulnerable driving them towards radicalism, simply being muslim drives them towards radicalism. It&rsquo;s who and what they and their religion are. Everything non-muslim makes them &#8216;feel vulnerable&rsquo;. As I said, THEY can solve this problem by living in muslim countries.</p>

			<p>vulnerable individuals who can be put on the path of radicalism</p>
<p>Why not put them on the path to the Middle East instead?</p>

<p>These sentences qualify as oxymorons. The medrassas are turning the muslims into terrorists, our own governments are turning otherwise law abiding whites into possible terrorists.</p>

			<p>There was a movie I saw recently that this reminds me of. I think it was called  V for Vendetta or something. It`s about a Zorro type character who fights against a facist regime in what appears to be a Britian of the future. <br>
  Anyway there is a scene with Judi Dench as a government minister  where she is made to answer for her crimes against her people. The hero comes into her home at night to serve a death warrrant for betraying her own kind. She answers meekly that she knows she deserves it, but she wants to know if &#8220;it will hurt much.&#8221; The avenger answers in a soothing voice that it will be &#8220;just like going to sleep.&#8221; <br>
  And I sat there and thought what a coward. She knew all along it was poison that she was spreading. But it made her feel important to betray her own kind. It reminded me of every person like Susan Sontag or that blue eye/brown eye lady filling the heads of  White children with self hate. The people who thought this one up  also would be ripe for a knock on the door in the middle of the night. And deserving of one at that!!</p>

			<p>While the police and politicians and social workers are looking for Muslim victims, I wonder what the interracial crime statistics really look like? And the interreligious crime stats?</p>

			<p>I realized, of course, some time ago that the English have been totally emasculated. I didn&rsquo;t realize, however, that the Scots had suffered the same treatment. They&rsquo;ve turned those kilts into skirts.</p>

			<p>This will eventually blow - this diversity thing - and when the people take to the streets - and they will - this one intends to look for the bastard faces behind these destructive policies.<br>

			<p>Yes, as a youth in Wales many moons ago, I often thought, &#8220;Well, if I happen to get bullied on the streets, at least I can have the last laugh&hellip;.I CAN TURN TO TERRORISM.&#8221;<br>
Oh, for fusscake. What are these people on??????</p>

			<p>Ice! Please elaborate on your comments about them regretting their policy. Who do you think will be affected? Native Scots enraged at their displacement or radical Muslims futher emboldened by the governments kowtowing?!?  Thanks Tim</p>
