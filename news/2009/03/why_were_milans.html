			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Lim, New York Magazine, March 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While New York&rsquo;s runways were more diverse than in seasons past, Milan was quite the opposite. Top Italian designers Gianfranco Ferr√©, Giorgio Armani, Jil Sander, Marni, Missoni, Moschino, Prada, and Salvatore Ferragamo featured all-white casts of models. And the few times when designers did book ethnic models, they picked from a small, highly-selective pool of girls: Jourdan Dunn, Liu Wen, and Marina Peres (Dunn, Wen, and Peres were the most requested girls from their respective groups.) When you break down the stats of all the ethnic girls the diversity issue on Milan&rsquo;s runways becomes even bleaker. We noticed that most of the girls had just one turn down the runway, while their Eastern European counterparts had two. Though at the shows where only one or two ethnic models were booked for a show, they would often do double duty having two looks. Way to get your money&rsquo;s worth, casting directors.</p>
<p>Even Prada, which broke a ten-year dry spell by featuring Jourdan Dunn for a couple of seasons, had no models of color. Nada. And this is coming from the country that made that made waves in fashion with their all-black issue of Italian Vogue just last year</p>
<p>We can understand that designers want their shows to be directional not only in their clothes, but in their selection of models, too. But what good is being directional if you&rsquo;ve been going the same direction for years? Picture this: Jourdan Dunn opening for Prada. Now that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d call directional.</p>

<p>Well, maybe the Eastern European models are just more attractive than their &#8220;ethnic&#8221; counterparts?</p>
<p>Nah, can&rsquo;t say that - being <i>RACIST!</i> and all.</p>

			<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Let black designers in africa hire all the black models they want, to strut the black designers creations and showcase their talents to their black audience. I for one, will not give a damn if they exclude whites from modeling, or even from the event itself!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Picked fromn a small highly selective pool of girls&#8221;<br>
 I remember when I was 19 or so seeing an article about actor Peter Lawford. It said he was unapologetic about prefering women &#8220;who were slim, blonde and athletic.&#8221; <br>
 And I said to myself, &#8220;I wanna be Peter Lawford! Peter Lawford with a conciliatory hand toward petite brunettes&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Because the whole concept and creativity of the fashion industry is white and the last time I had looked at an atlas,  Milan,Italy was still located in white Judeo-Christian Europe not diversified Africa.</p>

			<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said before- - START YOUR OWN DAMN FASHION SHOWS!!! It&rsquo;s not up to Europeans or anyone else to put blacks in THEIR shows. I would also think that the number of blacks buying these cloths is VERY small, so it makes good business sence to market your product to the people that acually buy them. I mean, a petite, blonde White woman probably couldn&rsquo;t picture herself in an outfit if Esther Rolles came stomping down the runway wearing it!!! </p>

<p>Exactly.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be European models in Europe? Should that be anything surprising?  Milan, after, all is a city in Europe! Would anybody complain about Chinese models in Shanghai? </p>
<p>Africans can have their own&hellip;  but do it in Africa! That&rsquo;s fine with me. Why do they have to be everywhere we are, and get in on everything we are doing?  Just go away and leave us alone.</p>

			<p>Just wanted to say that my girlfriend does much of her shopping by catalog. Which means we get tons of them in the mail. In almost all of the Spring ones we recieved, all of the new Season`s colors are some variation of that hideous shade of Chartreuse the first lady was wearing on election day. Ranging from some knd of metallic Lime Green to a color that can`t be named, only described as some sort of Muratic Acid Yellow&hellip; I guess this means that fashion is reactive and most people are followers. </p>

			<p>   To Obscuratus: Damn right! The eastern European women are better looking. One of the few times I tune in PBS nowadays is when ballroom dancing is on. Go ahead and laugh; but you will see some of the most gorgeous, athletic women in the world at those dance contests. 99.9% of them are from Russia or nearby countries.</p>

			<p>Nothing is more contradictory  than hearing an industry, created by whites,  which still primarily caters to whites, in an indigenously white country, be accused of &#8220;white washing&#8221;. The nerve of these white designers using white models! Impossible though it may be to imagine, if Kenya or Nigeria were to have their own world class fashion industry, would anyone be shocked if the vast majority of the models were Black-African? Not in the least! What would be shocking, and impossible to even imagine, would be, whites bitterly complaining that the models were black, and whites were not getting enough representation. <br>

<p>They literally want it all! They have their own Black awards shows, their own Black pageants, their own Black network, and yet they still complain when a black singer or actor doesn&rsquo;t get nominated or win the much coveted award, they still complain when their aren&rsquo;t enough black Miss America contestants. </p>
<p>So even if their were a black fashion industry, they would still be complaining, that not enough of models in Europe are black. </p>
<p>On many forums on the web, black women can often be found complaining that the beauty and fashion industry, is too Eurocentric, and, &#8220;quote&#8221; Still hold white women up as the beauty standard &#8220;unquote&#8221; </p>
<p>They truly believe that even though Madison avenue still caters to a mostly white upscale clientele, that minorities, and especially black women, should be held up as THE standard of beauty, that they should aspire to.</p>

			<p>As a reply to the ridiculuous whining that too many models in Italian fashion shows are white like the Italians who host the shows, I will propose that fashion shows not only include more black models, but also more grotesquely obese models.  With bad teeth.  And hairlips.</p>
<p>Fight &#8220;lookism&#8221;.  Because it&rsquo;s bad.  </p>

			<p>When I&rsquo;m watching a woman model clothes I pay attention to the way it makes the model look not the way the clothes look.  I picture myself looking like the model with the same hairstyle, shoes, jewelry, etc.  The whole point is to fantasize about being as attractive as the model and it influences me to buy the clothes.  Seeing some black woman modeling the same clothes would only remind me that I need to make a trip to the DMV to renew my registration. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m going to say something that might hurt a few peoples feelings but it needs to be said.  Black people and women in particular, are generally seen as ugly to Whites.  Google a picture of Jourdan Dunne and tell me if you think she should be a model.  It&rsquo;s natural for people to prefer their own.  The problem here is not wicked White racism but a lack of self-esteem on the part of blacks.  You shouldn&rsquo;t care what we think about you and we certainly don&rsquo;t care what you think about us.  Are designers eventually going to have to parade their creations on farm animals or robotic mannequins to keep from hurting your feelings?</p>

			<p>Who wants to watch some black model ruining the look at the lovely clothes??? Milan is a white city, so who wants to look at the blacks??? Milan is NOT downtown Detroit or LA. </p>

			<p>Even if there were more ethnic models, the complaints would continue, but against other ethnic models. </p>
<p>Extremely dark-skinned models (a la Alek Wek) would begin complaining about lighter skinned ethnic models, as would blacks with more Africanized features (broad nose, coarse hair) complaining against against those with non-black features.</p>
<p>Nobody wins in multiculturalism.<br>

			<p>Some one commented in the article comments, that the Eastern European models look bland, or boring, and probably by extension all other white models. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very strange, because white models are THE MOST DIVERSE of all. </p>
<p>First off, hair color, you have redheads, blondes, auburn, brunettes, dark/light brown haired models white models, with naturally straight, wavy, curly hair. The natural hair-color of black models&hellip; black, &#8220;Latinas&#8221; black and brown. Natural afro-hair styles for black models, are tightly coiled black hair. Latina&rsquo;s based on how much white blood they have can have all types straight, wavy, curly, afro hair. Asians, almost without exception have straight black hair. Black colored hair is the most common, thus the most bland, thus the most boring. </p>
<p>The color of the eyes of white models, are blue, green, brown, hazel, amber, and shades in between. The huge majority of black, &#8220;latina&#8221;, Asian models have brown eyes, which is also the world&rsquo;s most common eye color. Thus, brown eyes are the most common, thus the most bland, thus the most boring. </p>
<p>How about combinations of eye color and hair color, natural hair style&hellip; the white models win this hands down. The natural pigmentation of white people also varies from porcelain Nordic skin tones to tanned Southern Italian and Spanish skin tones. The natural pigmentation of black people is black, but can vary on how much white blood they have, same thing with &#8220;Latinas.&#8221; </p>
<p>When I see white Brazilian models like Gisele, Alessandra, Isabella, Caroline, and white Eastern European models like Anne V, Daria, Caroline Kurkova, Natalia Vodianova, etc. I marvel in the variety and diversity of these girls. Yes they are all white but they look very different. Anyone who says white models all look alike and are boring, probably thinks all white people look alike, which means to me that person is just a racist and actually plain ignorant.  <br>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a hate crime?  These designers need to be brought up on charges of racism.  They need to spend time in a corretional facility.  This is pure, unadulterated hatred.</p>
