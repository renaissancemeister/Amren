<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>England&rsquo;s biggest St George&rsquo;s Day parade is facing the axe after councillors said many of those attending it were racist.</p>
<p>For the last decade up to 15,000 have assembled in the town of West Bromwich under the slogan &#8216;Forever England, For Everyone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Children and parents from all over the country parade through the Black Country town waving St George flags and marching to rousing anthems such as Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Organisers say one of the aims is to reclaim the Saint George Cross from Right-wingers and make it a source of pride for all.</p>
<p>But last night the local council, Labour-controlled Sandwell, voted to withdraw its support for the parade. Funds will go to support a Party in the Park instead.</p>
<p>It leaves parade organisers with what they say is the impossible task of raising £10,000 to cover their costs with only a few weeks to go.</p>
<p>In a letter to the organisers, one councillor, Yvonne Davies, said the parade created an &#8216;unhealthy atmosphere&rsquo; and inspired young boys to be racist.</p>
<p>She wrote: &#8216;It is not only the parade which is the problem, but the tribal excitement it creates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The West Bromwich St George&rsquo;s Day parade started in 1998 and began as a fairly modest affair with 5,000 turning up. Now three times that attend the two-mile parade in April. Fire Service and Scout Association bands have played, the British Legion lends its support and each year ex-servicemen attend.</p>
<p>A volunteer dresses up as St George and rides with the marchers, children paint their faces with the St George Cross and there are activities such as medieval jousting.</p>
<p>There have been some problems  &mdash;  last year organisers had to clamp down on drinking in the street and a band with hard-Right roots joined in without their permission.</p>
<p>Councillor Davies wrote in her letter: &#8216;I am sure most are very respectful and law-abiding, however some are distasteful in the extreme and wish to divide and separate people from each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said she had once been abused by youths who &#8216;had been emboldened by the parade and thought racist chants were funny&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have seen first hand how the parade (albeit unintentionally) creates an unhealthy atmosphere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At a meeting of Sandwell council cabinet last night, her colleagues sided with her and decided against backing the parade. Instead there will be the Party in the Park, a concert in the Town Hall and St George Flags will be flown on all of the council&rsquo;s buildings.</p>
<p>Trevor Collins of the Stone Cross Saint George Association, which organises the parade, said: &#8216;To suggest the parade is racist is ridiculous and offensive. When you see the kids, the dogs, everyone out having fun, it&rsquo;s really a beautiful sight. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re black, white, green, brown or whatever, everyone&rsquo;s welcome.</p>
<p>&#8216;The council&rsquo;s decision means we have to foot the bills for insurance and security. We&rsquo;ve got to come up with £10,000 in two months which seems impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another organiser Mark Cowles said the parades had raised £7,000 for charity. He added that, as well as losing out on council support, they had probably missed the deadline for applying for road closures.</p>
<p>&#8216;All we wanted to do was organise a fun, family-friendly day for everyone that celebrates being English,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;We have been approached by extreme Right-wing groups and we have turned them away.&rsquo;</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/4117412.Muslim_parade_date_set_for_High_Wycombe/">Rolling Road Blocks Will Be in Place for Holy Parade</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Alex Hayes, This Is Local London, February 11, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A HUGE annual procession through the centre of High Wycombe to mark a Muslim holy day will take place in March.</p>
<p>Rolling road closures will be put on place whilst the procession to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad takes place around several streets in the town centre, on Sunday, March 15.</p>
<p>It will start from the Green Street Mosque, travel down Desborough Road and Bridge Street and onto Oxford Road and on to Castle Street.</p>
<p>From there worshippers will walk down Corporation Road, turn right along the High Street and into Paul&rsquo;s Row, then through the underpass and up to Wycombe Hospital where they will stop for short prayers for the sick.</p>
<p>From here they will make their way back to the Mosque in Green Street.</p>
<p>Roads closures will start from 11.30am and last until 2.30pm.</p>
<p>Sarah Widows, of Buckinghamshire County Council&rsquo;s Highways Department, said the parade is expected to take about two hours.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;Rolling road closures will be in place. Police will stop traffic to allow the parade to pass, before reopening the road and allowing traffic to flow again.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is actually good news for the BNP. Hopefully they can run with this and increase their numbers. What kind of Bizarro world are we living in when the English can&rsquo;t celebrate their own heritage in their own country, but Muslims get special treatment for their parade?</p>

<p>Of course. Heaven forbid the English people should come to think of England as their country. We just can&rsquo;t have that now can we!</p>
<p>(I knew as soon as I read the headline that it was the Labour party that was behind this. There has never been a greater foe to Englishmen then the marxist Labourites.) </p>

			<p>Notice the complaint about it creating &#8220;tribalism.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s White tribalism  &mdash;  they fear  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s time that Whites did re-tribalize.  We are Whites.  We are born White.  We will live our lives as Whites.  </p>

			<p>Maybe the BNP will &#8220;organize&#8221; an unorganized spontaneous parade with no leaders (so the anti-white bigots can&rsquo;t arrest any leaders).  Hmmmm. Just a thought. Good way to get some publicity, rally some folks, educate some others and stick it to the anti-white bigots and send them scurrying to hide.</p>

			<p>This is OK.  Let the Cross of Saint George, let the Union Jack, be symbols of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Much better to have our own symbols that to share them with outlanders and traitors.  Recall a few years ago the big pro-immigration rallies in this country under the Mexican flag?  Since then, the organizers of these demonstrations have tried to get the marchers  to carry American flags, trying to disguise Mexican mobs as patriotic Americans.  But whenever they do, the young ones insist on their own flag, the Rojo, Blanco, and Verde.  It&rsquo;s good for everyone to see who is on which side.</p>

I had an epiphany a while back concerning racist jokes. The reason they are are looked down on is not because they are offensive to victim groups but because they create a sense of solidarity to the ones telling and hearing them. And that cannot be condoned&hellip;</p>

			<p>Europe is slowly but surely destroying every last outlet for White pride, National Pride, and the questioning of unlimited immigration. If you try to express and of the first two, or bring up the latter, you are immediately deemed a racist and pilloried. </p>
<p>All these liberals, Islam coddlers and White self-haters will be in for one hell of a shock when they realize that regular British subjects are tired of them. Vote one the BNP!</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find the Dilbert cartoon from yesterday (if someone has a link, post it) but it suggests the faster way to raise the 10,000 pounds.  Dilbert is told to pick out someone he hates and post it on the internet.  In the last frame he is taking a telephone call.

			<p>Heh.  Remember the last black carnival (I forget what it&rsquo;s called, it&rsquo;s a yearly thing if I remember correctly) that was held in London?  I believe there were even a few murders, not to mention rioters (see: blacks) charging lines of police officers and hurling bricks and what not at them.</p>
<p>Last time I checked, it wasnt being canceled.  Neither were pro-palestine demonstrations that almost always end in rioting.</p>

			<p>&lsquo;It is not only the parade which is the problem, but the tribal excitement it creates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sentence identifies the part of the problem - some people&rsquo;s fear of the primal part of our being.  We should be celebrating our tribal, visceral  side.  To try to crush and eradicate all primal, elemental emotions is unnatural.  Feminism and fear of manly displays of cameraderie are what I see.   </p>

			<p>let me get this straight, theyve decided to replace the Parade with a Party in the Park but there isnt enough to time to raise the money for it. and they expect us to believe this is a recent decision by the council? doubtful. the timing was probably planned that way. dont forget to vote BNP.</p>

<p>Partisan politics at work.  These types of nativist rallies will build support for an alternative to Labour, be that the Conservatives or the BNP.  Labour couldn&rsquo;t possibly benefit, so they are opposed.</p>

I hope there&rsquo;s an impromptu, spontaneous gathering of like-minded folk who take to the streets with their flags.</p>
<p>They should take a lesson from the so-called &#8216;civil rights movement&rsquo; in the US and have a peaceful celebration. Make the police look like the bad guys.</p>

			<p>Just a thought.  While it is obvious that thebn PC gans have hijacked all true British traditions, the Muslim obne could be attended even by standing at te road side by hundreds or thusands of people with pet pigs or dogs on leads.  As long as any mess is cleand up on tb spot, no laws are being broken but the efect on the Muslims would be catastrophic as they abhor dogs and pigs even nore due to their centuries old, but now misplaced, phobias due to not being able to clean pigs of TB and wash dogs with water (in the deserts)</p>
<p>&#8220;Organisers say one of the aims is to reclaim the Saint George Cross from Right-wingers and make it a source of pride for all.&#8221;   What is wrong with a right-winger?  In Britain (not Great any more) the left wingers have been in govt. for over 11 years now and have once again caused a disaster with their poor governance and administration.  The days of the right wingers (Republicans?) in Britain are coming back, as they have for over 100 years, to sort out the mess the left has caused once again.  The pendulum is swinging back.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The days of the right wingers (Republicans?) in Britain are coming back, as they have for over 100 years, to sort out the mess the left has caused once again. The pendulum is swinging back.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a lot more than merely &#8220;the pendulum swinging back to the Right&#8221; in Britain, because England&rsquo;s crisis now is unprecedented and horridly acute.  When the pendulum swung in previous eras, England was overwhelmingly White and English, so the damage was reparable and the Rightist parties could take care of it.  It&rsquo;s not that way anymore  &mdash;   if you go to almost any of the bigger cities and even most of the smaller cities in England, they&rsquo;re effectively replicas of African villages, West Asian desert towns or overcrowded slums straight from the Indian Subcontinent.  The UK&rsquo;s demographics have changed to a startling degree  &mdash;   with enormous swathes in England already majority non-white.  I did a schools project years ago and even then, in most of the schools where I was at least, most of the pupils were not English and not white at all.  </p>
<p>Notice that all the major parties, the whole Liberal/Labour/Conservative bunch, are essentially forced to pander to the new demographics.  Recall that it was a Tory (Nigel Hastilow)  &mdash;   not a Labourite or Liberalite  &mdash;   who suffered the harshest punishment for &#8220;not toeing the PC line,&#8221; essentially having his career ruined for defending Enoch Powell.  And even the Tory candidates are increasingly taking on a non-white character, just as the Republicans in the USA are selling out American Whites by selecting Michael Steele and Bobby Jindal as their standardbearers, and forcing out their white candidates.  So, the major British parties are all under the thumb of PC, perhaps because like the Republicans, the demographic shift is pushing them to pander  &mdash;   almost all of the competitive MP seats have heavy and rapidly growing African and Asian populations, so the major parties are desperate to curry votes from them.  The only hope for England would be the BNP pulling off a spectacular victory (and so we should be working our hearts out for them), but I fear it&rsquo;s already too late for England, their population has changed far too dramatically far too quickly.  </p>
<p>The only silver lining is that this disaster is becoming a cautionary tale elsewhere in the West.  This is one reason that nationalist parties and politicians elsewhere have been not only gaining support, but actually gaining many seats and exerting real power  &mdash;   such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands (whom the British authorities kept out this week), Vlaams Belang in Belgium, the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs in Austria, CSU in Germany, Paulo Portas in Portugal, People&rsquo;s Party in Denmark, the FN in France, Umberto Bossi in Italy, Christoph Blocher in Switzerland, Carl Hagen in the Norwegian Parliament.  Much of Europe has a real, successful Right, and if you translate the campaign planks they&rsquo;ve used to boost their successes (which are available in many of the journalistic databases), you&rsquo;ll find many references to the demographic disaster overwhelming places like Canada and England.  I&rsquo;m not at all saying we should give up on the UK, I&rsquo;m just saying that we need to reject any illusion that England can be helped by a mere &#8220;pendulum swing&#8221;  &mdash;   the crisis is far deeper than that and a far greater change is needed.  Only the BNP can save England now, if indeed it still can be saved at all, and we should work hard to help them.</p>

			<p>If it&rsquo;s tribal excitement Councillor Davies is concerned about she should come to NY in June for the Puerto Rican Day parade or in Sept for the West Indian Day parade. I can guarantee her it won&rsquo;t be excitement that she will get it will be absolute MAYHEM Our great multicult Mayor Bloomberg even has the nerve to tell property owner&rsquo;s on 5th Ave not to board up their property for Puerto Rican day as it is insulting to these very PROUD PEOPLE.</p>

			<p>Wait, every ethnicity in the world can have a parade, but the English can&rsquo;t have one, in England? </p>
<p>Yes, I would object if the English came down my street with all their paraphernalia. But I don&rsquo;t live in England! </p>
<p>It would, however, be an awful shame if the English were to disappear from the earth. And if they let this kind  of thing happen, it will. </p>
<p>Sorry, the only way to wake them up is to call this what it is: pathetic. </p>
<p>Are you English? Are you reading this? You&rsquo;re PATHETIC. Go out their, grab a flag, and march down the street in a peaceable fashion and prove me wrong. </p>

			<p>Anonymous, I Googled for  a pic of her, she&rsquo;s White.  I suspect she&rsquo;s using that term &#8216;tribal&rsquo; because she wants to portray White folk as primitive and unruly. Subconsciously, she probably really thinks of Blacks in this way and is trying to project their traits onto Whites (just to level the playing field don&rsquo;t ya know!). She&rsquo;s a sick individual who is using her position to betray her nation.<br>

			<p>B J Deller asks &ldquo;What is wrong with right-wingers?&rdquo;. <br>
 This is key Mr Deller, and it goes all the way back to the victory of the Left in WWII. By labeling their former ally the Socialist Adolph Hitler and his Nazis as Rightwing racists, anyone even remotely associated with the Rightwing of politics was also tainted and for decades kept quiet about immigration and multicult.  I know because I experienced these attacks. Good people don&rsquo;t want their children labeled Fascists at school, they need to be employed, no-one can tolerate being socially ostracised, and the truth of the matter is that for half a century Conservatives really did think that they were on the same polarity as Nazis. We now know this to be untrue and that in fact Hitler was a Socialist,a Leftist. Right-wingers have nothing to be ashamed of, that burden lies where it always should have, with the Left.<br>

			<p>Wikipedia has this concerning St. George&rsquo;s Day.  Scroll down to St. George Day in England.  It appears that St. George&rsquo;s Day is celebrated throughout much of Europe.  I hope England starts appreciating its old traditions.  For a long time it hasn&rsquo;t been considered &#8220;cool&#8221; or &#8220;hip&#8221; to celebrate tradition.  I am sick and tired of this constant demeaning of tradition.  What has been put in its place? A tacky, cheesy dyfunctional culture.</p>

			<p>With &#8220;racist thugs&#8221; being defined as peaceable, White Brits&hellip; DESPITE THE MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE that the racist thugs are in reality, Britain&rsquo;s non-White immigrants!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m always surprised at the slander toward other whites in other countries by people on this forum. What country do you live in? Have you looked around lately?</p>

			<p>&lsquo;It is not only the parade which is the problem, but the tribal excitement it creates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My God these White People might actually think of themselves as a race, maybe even develop a race consciousness - which is the right only other races have - and even become, gasp!, proud of being White! Can&rsquo;t have that! Can&rsquo;t have that! </p>

			<p>This is surely proof that Britain is finished.  The natives who actually belong in Britain are &#8220;racist thugs&#8221; who must be prevented from parading on St. George&rsquo;s Day - the patron saint of their country, while the group of unassimilable aliens who commit suicide bombings on public transportation full of the innocent Britons they desperately hate is allowed a parade.</p>
<p>Voltaire once said, &#8220;Anyone who can make you believe nonsense can also make you commit atrocities,&#8221; suggesting that this, unfortunately, is only the beginning.</p>
