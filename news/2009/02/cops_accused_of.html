<h1>Cops Accused of Racial Profiling</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erin Cox, WTNH-TV (New Haven, Connecticut), January 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some in the New Haven community are outraged after cops posted pictures inside a substation of &#8220;disruptive&#8221; residents who all happen to be black males.</p>
<p>None are wanted for crimes, and the photos have since been removed, but the outrage over why they went up in the first place brings accusations of racial profiling to the New Haven police department.</p>
<p>It all began when pictures of African-American men were put up by police inside the Whalley Avenue substation.</p>
<p>The episode revealed this police tactic of maintaining a sort of &#8220;file&#8221; or &#8220;list&#8221; of certain individuals described as disruptive in order to keep streets safe. New Haven chief of police James Lewis denies it&rsquo;s profiling, but one group sees it differently. They went right to the front door of the police substation to level accusations of police profiling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The demonstration was a direct response to mug shots of 25 young African-American men posted on a wall of the Whalley Avenue substation at a public, neighborhood meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chief Lewis defends the tactic in a statement to News Channel 8: &#8220;The practice of maintaining photographs of members of a community who pose a threat to public safety is standard operation in police departments.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the display of the photographs at the public meeting has led to concerns about racial profiling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When there is a shooting in the neighborhod it affects the whole neighbhorhood,&#8221; said Greer [Eli Greer a neighborhood &#8220;activist&#8221;]. &#8220;When a group feels racially profiled it affects the whole neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; residents who all happen to be black males.  None are wanted for crimes&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Note that it doesn&rsquo;t say &#8220;none are criminals&#8221; or &#8220;none have criminal records&#8221;, or even &#8220;<i>some</i> don&rsquo;t have convictions&#8221;!  The journalist merely states that none were being actively sought on open warrants at the time the photos were posted.  Seems like an big omission, unless the journalist is trying to hide the fact that these 25 of men have criminal records and multiple run-ins with law enforcement.  </p>
<p>Interesting.  </p>
<p>Exit Question: How did the police get <b>mug shots</b> of innocent men for their horribly unfair racist profiling?  </p>

Then it would have shown diversity.</p>

			<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for Greer the neighborhood activist to be hiding in his closet while the bullies (black of course) run rampant through the neighborhood.</p>
<p>When there are no longer whites around to maintain order, he can live and die in his self made third world.</p>

			<p>Man, there&rsquo;s liberals and then there&rsquo;s batspit crazy liberals. Not to be too off topic, but out here in Oakland there was just news footage of some white hipster nitwit demanding that the BART police be disbanded in the wake of the recent accidental shooting of a thug (on parole, fighting on the train).DISBANDED. Look, there will always be the possibility of abuses of one kind or another from the police and they do have to be put into line from time to time, but these idiots would like to just eliminate police altogether. I wrote something about that before I saw this guy on the news, half intending it just as hyperbole, but no, they want to just get rid of all cops. For God&rsquo;s sake, what kind of idiots actually want that? Sure, I can see some moronic ghetto fabulous block captain saying that kind of stuff, but it&rsquo;s the college kids spewing this insanity that really make my head spin.  </p>

			<p>I keep seeing links to articles in Connecticut newspapers &amp; other news outlets.</p>
<p>I am relieved that SOMEONE is shedding light on how &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is destroying southern New England.</p>
<p>New Haven has an image as a staid, ivy-covered &#8216;Athens of America&rsquo;, when in fact it is Dodge City.  Yale is surrounded by housing projects and New Haven is plagued by miscreants&rsquo; violence.</p>
<p>Awesome pizza, though, AND check out Louis&rsquo; Lunch, where they say the hamburger was invented.  They scowl at you if you ask for ketchup, though.</p>
<p>So is this what it feels like when the media promotes narratives about your area that have NOTHING to do with the truth?</p>
<p>I feel your pain, Dixie.</p>

			<p>why don&rsquo;t those citizens tell the 25 or so trouble makers to behave and respect the law? The cops are only trying to do their jobs by maintaining law and order for the tax payers. We need more police like these!</p>

			<p>What do you call a Black man with criminal tendencies?  A Black man, and the New Haven police know this, and they are trying to protect their city.  The police are the ones who are handcuffed, not the criminals  &mdash;  handcuffed by political correctness.  </p>
<p>I live in Connecticut, and I know that New Haven has a serious Black crime issue, and this is within blocks of Yale University.  Perhaps the leftist media has been so successful and hiding the racial identity of most violent criminals from the public, and even the Blacks themselves think that the ghettos they live in are no different from the white suburban neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>I think that maybe we should start an organization of white criminals. We could purposefully commit petty crimes and arrange with the police to have ourselves arrested. Then the police could balance the demographic balance sheet of their arrests and then could then go about the business of actual police work without fear of arresting too many black criminals&hellip;</p>

<p>If they are so harmless, why are there mug shots of them?</p>
<p>I remember when I was in high school in San Francisco back around 1970.  The police headquarters detectives office had pictures of the hundred most wanted criminals in San Francisco.  At the time, the black population of San Francisco was a mere 11 percent.  The hundred most wanted criminals just happened to be black.</p>
<p>So the black community was of course totally outraged that the detective division exposed the truth about high black crime rates by posting the pictures of the hundred most wanted.</p>
<p>I totally enjoy these articles about college neighborhoods and towns surrounded by dangerous black ghettoes.  The liberals are under seige by their beloved black criminals, but they will never admit it.  Liberals hate us law abiding whites, but their beloved blacks hate white liberals and rob, beat, rape and murder them even as the librals exonerate black criminals from all blame.</p>

<p>The same analogy should apply for people such as yourself. If a black man doesn&rsquo;t work hard he&rsquo;s typical and a low life. If a black man works hard, studies, abides by the law, goes to college, and gets high paying job then you will say &#8220;Oh it&rsquo;s affrimative action.&#8221; </p>
<p>Your typical.</p>

			<p>My goodness, Mr. Rational Thinker, it is so pleasant to find a brutha who admits that if a black man works hard he can go far AND he can do it without affirmative action.  </p>
<p>I certainly hope you will join hand with us and help destroy affirmative action, since black folks don&rsquo;t need it and it is at is core distilled racism.  </p>
<p>The added bonus being, as you note, that no one can say the brutha done got the job because or his race.  And won&rsquo;t that be liberating!</p>

<p>If a black man goes to college and gets a high-paying job, the facts will reveal that he did so STRICTLY because of Affirmative action in the VAST MAJORITY of cases.</p>
<p>Consider please the fact that blacks have an average group I.Q. of 85 (including mulattos), and that black males score much lower than black females might be a very valid reason to question black male accomplishments.  Add to those facts that universities are pressed to pass X number of blacks in order to hand out unearned degrees and it becomes clear that anybody would have to ignore reality not to assume a black in a successful position was awarded the position to keep black mouths quiet.</p>

So that&rsquo;s your only comment in response to this article about BLACK CRIME and BLACK COMMUNITIES making excuses for criminals?  You have nothing at all to say about the topic at hand, you just try to change the subject.  Uncomfortable with facts, aren&rsquo;t you&hellip;Mr. ironically-named &#8220;rational thinker&#8221;!  </p>

<p>Thank you, Jill. That is an EXCELLENT question, which should have been immediately obvious to the so-called reporter. Those mug shots didn&rsquo;t just HAPPEN to be in police possession.</p>
