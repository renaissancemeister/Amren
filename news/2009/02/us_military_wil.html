<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html?hp">U.S. Military Will Offer Path to Citizenship</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stretched thin in Afghanistan and Iraq, the American military will begin recruiting skilled immigrants who are living in this country with temporary visas, offering them the chance to become United States citizens in as little as six months.</p>
<p>Immigrants who are permanent residents, with documents commonly known as green cards, have long been eligible to enlist. But the new effort, for the first time since the Vietnam War, will open the armed forces to temporary immigrants if they have lived in the United States for a minimum of two years, according to military officials familiar with the plan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The military does not allow illegal immigrants to enlist, and that policy would not change, officers said. Recruiting officials pointed out that volunteers with temporary visas would have already passed a security screening and would have shown that they had no criminal record.</p>

			<p>We are bankrupt!! We cannot afford to patrol Afghanistan. Our AMERICAN troops need to be on our southern border. What is so hard about this? This is downright terrifying - who is pulling the strings and what is the ultimate goal?</p>

			<p>It`s funny to drive out into the country and see the good but simple minded people who still think that the military is &#8220;Protecting our way of life.&#8221; Over there?!? I used to think that any foreigner who fought in uniform should get citizenship as a matter of course. Someone on this site changed my point of view. They pointed out that a foreigner, who is granted citizenship, will owe his allegience to the government, while having no natural feelings of affection or kinship for the people. To wit, they are not patriots, but a dagger pointed at the throat of native Americans.</p>

Isn&rsquo;t recruiting foreigners and non-citizens historically a sign that an empire has run its course and is in decline?</p>
<p>When a nation can&rsquo;t attract its own people to fight its own wars it&rsquo;s because the people aren&rsquo;t fooled by talk of patriotism, honor, and threat to family and home front. What it comes down to is they see through the lies.</p>
<p>What about America is worth fighting for anymore? Multiculturalism? Muslim immigrants? Bilingual education? A country without industry and jobs to come back to after service? Being constantly called a &#8216;racist&rsquo; for any imaginary reason? Arrest, jailed, and fined for defending your home?</p>

			<p>i&rsquo;ve been in the navy for about 6 years now and worked with immigrants (non US citizens) from cambodia, vietnam, phillipines and most of the latino countries.  The asians are definitely harder working, while many hispanics seem to be &#8220;along for the ride&#8221;, though some do pull their weight.  The problem i see with the citizenship proposal is people enlisting for the minimum time, gaining citizenship,  and then bringing their entire family here to live on welfare or as dependents (this does happen), and then getting out of the military.  Another issue is the language barrier; ever try to explain to a cambodian a complex problem/issue when he doesnt even know broken english.  This guy was trying to spell &#8216;screw&rsquo; and put down &#8216;cru&rsquo;.  None of us knew what he meant and he couldnt explain, until he went and grabbed a screw.  i guess the good news is that if you are not a US citizen, you cannot be issued any type of security clearance.  These people will only fill the real &#8220;simpleton&#8221; type jobs.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the army will have to cope with a cadre of enlistees composed ONLY of non-citizens, until it catastrophically loses the next major war.  Alternately, the army might be looking for recruits who will be more willing to fire on innocent US citizens.  Take your pick.</p>

			<p>This may surprise some of the more enthusiastic flag-wavers here, but this practice is hardly new. The American military is, in so many ways, one enormous social-experiment otherwise presented as a fighting force. I don&rsquo;t say this to denigrate the brave soldiers of the aremed-services in any way. However, the policies and practices from the top down have created an environment that is a defacto proving ground for multiculturalism, egalitarianism and feminism in uniform. What a diabolical scheme when you think about it - use the very forces designed to protect America to undermine America and put it&rsquo;s traditional unity and values asunder from within! </p>

			<p>Yes, they want more for their EVIL excursions abroad. No doubt.<br>
But they REALLY want them for HERE even more. And that is saying plenty. Make no mistake about it.<br>
Look at the timing. Look at how this coincides with the push of these Hate Speech laws that protect selected groups, and selected speech for those selected groups. Groups that the Power Elite hopes will one day join the Military. </p>
<p>Does anyone think this is a coincidence?</p>

			<p>Here ye! Here ye!  Here ye!  Calling all non-White immigrants!  Hurry up and join the army so that it can be a stronghold for non-Whites.  Then if there&rsquo;s a revolution we can be sure that the army will be on the government&rsquo;s side.  Oh this traitorous and multi-cultural government thinks ahead!</p>
<p>There will be a language barrier even in the army.  It seems the more proof that this bums get about multiculturalism not working, the more they try to prove that it does.  </p>
<p>One of the biggest problems for women in the army today is Black men raping them, especially White women.</p>

			<p>  And so it would seem that nothing was learned from the fall of the Roman Empire. I may not be a great military strategist, however, if our troops levels are stretched that far, why not pull our troops out of Japan, Kosovo, Europe, South Korea, and all the other countries worldwide. Last count was 140+ countries around the world had a U.S. military presence. We cannot be the world police force any longer. Not enough money or troops to do it. From what I&rsquo;ve seen and the troops I&rsquo;ve talked with about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we would be better off to come home. They all say it is a joke. They are not allowed to win. Sound familiar? Korea and Vietnam? </p>

			<p>Just as Rome sealed its fate with the hiring of non-Romanized soldiery, the U.S. is sealing a similar fate for itself by imitating this well-known error.  They arrogantly think that the U.S., a nation that has lasted not even one quarter as long as Rome, is not subject to a repetition of history.</p>
<p>But this has been practiced on a smaller scale before.  During the Viet-Nam era foreigners were recruited, but not so many and many of those were adventure seeking Europeans.  I have been aware that Nigerians and other citizens of other African nations have been recruited directly in Africa.  This article pretends to deny any other recruitment style has been used.  Some of the atrocities in Iraq were actually perpetrated by these African recruits, something I think Amren informed us about earlier.  If the US Armed Forces enlarges this practice, then we will be approaching the Roman error because the reward for participating is immigration into the U.S.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m all for making them spend about 7 years for citizenship. I&rsquo;m sick of losing good white lives to foreign countries.</p>

			<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make sense&hellip;the recruitment numbers for the U.S. military have been WAY up for the last few months due to the current economic crisis, and more and more Americans are looking to ride out this economic crisis in the military because of the lack of jobs available in many areas.</p>

			<p>As other posters so accurately noted, recruiting foreigners into their military was the beginning of the end of Rome. Corruption in that ancient culture grew exponentially as well which accelerated the process.  </p>
<p>It truly is amazing how history repeats itself, but the amazement instantly ends when one considers the endings.</p>

			<p>Might seem off topic, but it isn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I love Tom Wolfe. Always have, always will.<br>
But not unconditionally. You can see him on Youtube with clips from an excerpt from some interview he did, talking about how the American Empire is going to last 800 years.  And he said it with a self-assurance that makes me blush for him. He wasn&rsquo;t blushing though. But that didn&rsquo;t make him believable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did hear him say that he wants to write a book about Immigration, and that he hadn&rsquo;t really thought about it much until recently (I think that goes for a lot of us really. Most of us came to this pretty late).</p>
<p>In any event, I do look forward to his thoughts on the subject. Once he&rsquo;s thought about it, and committed those thoughts to print.</p>

			<p>I had read a few weeks ago that military recruiting was up among Americans because of the bad economy.  I suppose it could just have been another propaganda piece to entice some young people into joining.  Nothing is beyond believing anymore.  Anyhow, after Obama&rsquo;s term is over the troops will still be in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay will still have prisoners being held there.  I used to be a supporter now I think it was all a lie and that somehow subduing the Middle East is the lynchpin in securing a one world government.  </p>

			<p>American citizenship, like the dollar, is becoming increasingly worthless.  Thanks to diversity, we&rsquo;re a bankrupt nation with a spiralling standard of living and an economy that produces nothing the world wants.  I look forward to the day (and that will be soon) when a would be immigrant laughs in the face of a military recruiter offering worthless paper money for compensation and citizenship to a country that will be a backward third world place.</p>

			<p>While in Iraq, I have already encountered an entire platoon of troops that did not speak any English, only their white CO and sergeants did and the sergeants were Hispanic. The platoon was, I believe, from Honduras or El Salvador. We really need to bring back the draft. Ugandans are in fact, being recruited by the U.S. Army, though I do not know the circumstances of said recruitment.</p>

			<p>Does anyone remember in which movie this scene takes place?</p>
<p>The setting is the bridge of an American warship, armed with NUCLEAR (not &#8220;Noo-kya-ler&#8221;) weapons. The commander is talking to his executive officer. The XO says something like, &#8220;How will we stop this war from destroying the entire world?&#8221; (I don&rsquo;t remember the exact line.) The commander replies, &#8221; I&rsquo;ll not start a war, but if the Russians fire one at us, I&rsquo;ll fire one.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which time, a seaman by the master fire control panel shouts, &#8220;Aye aye sir! Fire one!&#8221; And does it. Thereby starting World War III.</p>
<p>Nah&hellip;it&rsquo;s just a movie. Couldn&rsquo;t happen here. They wouldn&rsquo;t let a non-English speaker stand watch over nuclear weapons&hellip;would they? </p>

<p>Although 42 and thus overage, I would emigrate with my family and renounce my US citizenship if the US government ever reintroduced conscription.  The US government&rsquo;s openly stated goals are in direct opposition to most of my own interests, and I regard the notion of my fellow countrymen being FORCED to fight for this monstrously evil regime with revulsion.  This is the same government, keep in mind, that is flooding what used to be our country with Somalis and other third-worlders, and which has ensured it is nearly impossible for US-born scientists and engineers to find work in their own fields.  </p>

<p>My point in this, is that we (the U.S.) are following almost exactly the path that brought down the Roman empire. We need only wait until the barbarians throw their sword on the pile of ransom to be finished as a nation!!<br>

			<p>Instead of the country actually following the Constitution and not engaging in wars their populace isn&rsquo;t willing to fight, they simply rubber stamp AINOs to fill the military ranks. These AINOs can then be used against the populace should they ever try to get the government to follow the Constitution at some point in the future. It&rsquo;s a BAD idea friends all around for Americans to have foreign troops in our military.</p>

			<p>Yes, by employing foreign mercenaries, the US is following the path that led to the downfall of the Roman Empire, but a government that is unable to attract enough loyalty among its own citizenry deserves nothing less than downfall.  Love of country is a completely separate matter than loyalty to a government that uses our tax money to fill neighborhoods we pay high prices to live in with criminal minority groups, that uses our tax money to prop up despotisms across the globe, that uses our tax money to fund policies that actively descriminate against the productive majority that actually pays those taxes, that kidnaps foreign nationals off the streets of their own countries and flies them to secret locations to be tortured, that starts unprovoked wars and that admits as &#8220;refugees&#8221; to what had been our wonderful country uncivilizeable, violent groups who&rsquo;s claim to refugee status is that they have ruined their own nations.  This government deserves downfall, and I hope it is sooner, rather than later, so the genuine Americans like us can set things to rights before we have been repopulated into a Third-World dump.</p>
