<h1>Bloody Cockfighting Raid in NC Nets 73 Arrests</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 70 people have been arrested in a cockfighting ring that secretly gathered in central North Carolina to watch a $40,000 tournament so gruesome that one of the roosters splattered blood on the investigators&rsquo; search warrant, authorities said.</p>
<p>Deputies didn&rsquo;t expect to find so many people crammed into three chicken houses that had been cleaned out to provide hidden parking spaces and a cockfighting pit, Randolph County Sheriff Maynard Reid Jr. said in an interview Monday. Authorities arrested 73 people, ranging in age from 16 to 79, and charged them all with cockfighting and cruelty to animals, both felonies.</p>
<p>Reid said several others escaped after fleeing a back door during the raid Saturday afternoon at the site about 15 miles southeast of Asheboro in the center of North Carolina.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He described a grisly scene: About 20 birds were already dead, eliminated early from a deadly tournament. A fight was ongoing when deputies arrived, and one of the combatant roosters jumped up onto the betting table and spattered blood onto a search warrant that investigators were serving, Reid said.</p>
<p>Photos provided by the sheriff&rsquo;s office show a building strewn with feathers and debris, including several dead birds and a pile of empty beer cans dumped together in a corner. Makeshift benches surround a plywood ring, where the body another rooster is lying.</p>
<p>The tournament&rsquo;s grand champion, Reid said, was slated to win $40,000. He named the ringleader as 33-year-old Barry Ritter. Reid said Ritter was charging $25 to watch the event at a facility he owned with his father, who was not among those arrested.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office said investigators also seized 73 vehicles, two firearms and cash. They also found cocaine and marijuana at the scene. Much of the crowd was Hispanic, and Reid said authorities were still checking the immigration status of those arrested.</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s animal control officers took possession of 130 live roosters.</p>

			<p>This AP reporter is feckless and covering up who&rsquo;s really involved here. He only posted a mug shot of one of the 6 or so white rednecks that were arrested along with 65 Hispanics. Read the entire linked original article that first appeared in the Raleigh N&O; under AP reporter Mike Baker&rsquo;s byline. </p>
<p>For something that gets a little closer to the truth read this account of the events: <a href="http://www.courier-tribune.com/articles/2009/02/03/news/en1.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.courier-tribune.com/articles/2009/02/03/news/en1.txt</a>  </p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t tell (all of them) is that all but one arrestee had made bail by this morning and are free. ICE doesn&rsquo;t have any control whatsoever over this situation.</p>

			<p>How long will it be before dog fighting and bull fighting are added to the local civic arena, courtesy of the Mexican invaders?</p>

			<p>I wonder if the Mexicans understand that this sport is perfect for the spread of Bird Flu with all the blood spattered all over the place and dead birds. They put their health and those they love at risk. If there is an outbreak of Bird Flu it could be spread through this vector through out Mexico and the U.S.A. 60 percent of the people who get Bird Flu die from the infection.</p>

			<p>Actually, cockfighting has a long history in the South among Whites, so it comes as no surprise that the ringleader is White while many of the others were Hispanic.  Chickens are slaughtered legally every day, and if you&rsquo;ve ever seen the conditions under which it is done, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the most humane of conditions.  To compare this to dog fighting, which is very cruel, is rather misleading.<br>

			<p>Perhaps a black-hispanic coalition will press for cockfighting for the hispanics and dogfighting for the blacks.</p>

			<p>That Mexicans LOVE blood sports like cock fighting, bull fighting, etc., probably can be traced back to their Aztec and Mayan ancestors&hellip; watching their priests perform &#8220;open heart surgery&#8221; on their unwilling sacrificial victims. Sure, many sick Whites and even more sick Blacks enjoy dogs killing each other&hellip; thankfully I have more empathy for animals and would like to see ANYONE putting on dog- or cockfights to be jailed for a good, long time.</p>

			<p>Hey it&rsquo;s great they&rsquo;re checking the immigration status of those arrested, but still it&rsquo;s too little too late.  We&rsquo;ve had thousands of white people murdered by illegal aliens, and it wasn&rsquo;t until an east asian immigrant was murdered by another east asian immigrant that the police decided to start checking the immigration status of perps.  That should show you have much the system cares for whites, especially to those of you who still wish to vote and campaign.</p>
<p>Since we have no representation, what right does the government have to tax us?</p>

			<p>Actually, Fed Up, Mexican bullfighting came from the Spanish, and not the Aztecs.  Amerinds possessed no domesticated cattle in pre-Columbus days.  The Spanish had preserved it as a relic of the old Roman arena games.  The Romans generally pitted a bull against a bear or some other animal.  The medieval English used to fight dogs against bulls; that&rsquo;s what bulldogs were bred for.</p>
<p>Chicken slaughterhouses are not very pleasant places either, as one poster commented.  Hunters who can&rsquo;t shoot very well are producers of needless suffering in game animals.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m not certain cockfighting ought to be a felony, I don&rsquo;t have much respect for someone who thinks watching two animals tear each other to pieces is the height of entertainment.  Putting two bugs in a jar and then shaking it to get them fighting should be a passing childhood phase.</p>

			<p>Anonymous was right&hellip; cockfighting has a long history in the United States and at the time of this country&rsquo;s founding was an accepted sporting event. Our founding Fathers, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson reportedly were fans of the sport. </p>
