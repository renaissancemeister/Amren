			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, February 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For more than five years, U.S. immigration authorities have touted the success of a national program aimed at arresting and deporting dangerous criminals and fugitives.</p>
<p>In frequent early morning raids at homes in Los Angeles and around the country, federal fugitive teams have sought out immigrants with criminal records or outstanding deportation orders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But new data released Wednesday showed that 73% of the nearly 97,000 people arrested by the fugitive operations teams between 2003 and early 2008 did not have criminal records, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.</p>
<p>The data, along with newly released internal memos, show that the agency abandoned its stated mission to go after dangerous fugitives and instead targeted noncriminal undocumented workers  &mdash;  the &#8220;low-hanging fruit,&#8221; said Peter L. Markowitz, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law in New York, who sued the government to get the documents.</p>
<p>The memos show that in 2006, Immigration and Customs Enforcement changed its focus from criminals and fugitives to increasing the number of arrests.</p>
<p>Each seven-member fugitive operations team was expected to increase its annual arrests from 125 to 1,000. At the same time, the agency stopped requiring that 75% of those arrested be criminals and allowed the teams to include non-fugitives in their tally, the memos show.</p>
<p>That, the report said, meant teams were arresting any illegal immigrant they encountered during their operations, regardless of whether the person had an outstanding deportation order or a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fugitives with criminal histories made up 9% of arrests in fiscal year 2007, compared with 32% in 2003, according to the report, which relied on Department of Homeland Security numbers.</p>
<p>Unauthorized workers with no criminal records or outstanding deportation orders made up 40% of arrests in fiscal year 2007, compared with 18% in 2003.</p>
<p>The policy change coincided with increased demands by the Bush administration to step up enforcement, Markowitz said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said the agency had always focused on fugitives who posed a threat to national security or public safety but that agents enforced federal law if they came across other illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that when we go to locations looking for individuals with prior deportation orders, it is not uncommon for us to encounter other immigration violators,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When that occurs, we are going to take proper enforcement action.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has not made any changes to the fugitive operations program, but she issued a directive calling for a review.</p>

			<p>Pardon the article&rsquo;s bad analogy, but &#8220;picking the low-hanging fruit&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean that they shouldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;picked,&#8221; it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t have any criminal record or warrants other than being here illegally in the first place.  But I am of the mindset that deporting them is tantamount to preventing future crimes, because many of them will wind up committing one felony or another anyway.</p>
<p>The left doesn&rsquo;t want us to deport all illegal aliens, just the ones with rap sheets.  Big deal, I say, because that&rsquo;s only deporting a small fraction of the men.  That leaves behind a very large Mexican population, the ones born here are automatically citizens, many of the boys will be MS-13, Latin Kings, 18th Streeters when they become men.  But at the same time, the left and neo-con right doesn&rsquo;t want to &#8220;split up families.&#8221;  Criminal illegal aliens are somebody&rsquo;s family.</p>

			<p>This is all irrelevant anyway with the coming of the new administration, which owes much of its victory in the 2008 elections to the illegals lobby and is openly pro-amnesty.  Michael Chertoff  &mdash;   the one man in power who stood up to the illegal alien invasion  &mdash;   was kicked out of office, and now that he&rsquo;s gone, any prospect of standing up to the invasion has vanished with him.  The tough economy has made it a little more difficult for the illegals, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter  &mdash;   they still have it much better here than south of the border, and besides, the legal immigration numbers alone (aside from the illegals) are making the USA white minority in 20 years.  I grew up in California but will never return there  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s already 3rd World, if anything even worse in Arizona, New Mexico, increasingly even in Texas.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is bringing my family to a crossroads.  It&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear that the United States will be a majority non-White, non-Western nation by about 2024 or so.  We&rsquo;re not quite the worst country in that respect  &mdash;   Britain is on a headlong course of rapid self-destruction by perhaps 2015 and will be the first in the West to disappear as a Western nation, with Australia in particular soon to follow a few years later.  I spent much of 2006 and &#8216;07 in either the UK or Australia on contracting projects, and in England in particular, it&rsquo;s hard to spot a White face anymore especially in the schools.  Even the rural areas now basically have a majority of people from Bangladesh or Zimbabwe.  For Australia&rsquo;s part, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne look like carbon copies of Sudan, Indonesia and the Philippines, with the rest of the country following.  But the USA isn&rsquo;t far behind (nor is Canada, for that matter)  &mdash;   our schools already have a shrinking White minority.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything in particular against Obama, but his election is the tip of a very devastating iceberg for White Americans, which is the inevitably of our coming minority status, and then it&rsquo;s South Africa in North America.  I don&rsquo;t want my kids to grow up in an environment like that  &mdash;   they&rsquo;re supposed to grow up in a Western country, which won&rsquo;t be the USA anymore.  And I don&rsquo;t know easy solutions  &mdash;   do folks here have some suggestions?  I&rsquo;m honestly asking here.  It&rsquo;s nice to talk about &#8220;staying and fighting,&#8221; but how?  Our government is under the control of neoliberal globalists from both parties who want to inundate our electorate with cheap labor replacements from the Third World, and short of a revolution (and a partition perhaps), there&rsquo;s no way to stop it.  The UK and Australia are a bit more advanced in their demographic replacement, but we aren&rsquo;t far behind.  I can&rsquo;t understand why there&rsquo;s such a frustrating lack of nationalism in the UK and Australia in particular, but the USA as well.</p>
<p>The contrast with some other Western countries is shocking  &mdash;   my cousin emigrated to live in SE Germany in Thuringia with his wife and 2 kids, and I went to visit him late last year.  In his son&rsquo;s school and in the neighboring schools, almost all the kids are White and have no qualms about their Western identity, and they get a much better education in a healthier environment.  Germany does have millions of immigrants, but they&rsquo;re almost all ethnic Germans, Dutch, Anglo-Saxons, Norwegians, or other Nordics (esp. Balto-Slavic peoples) from E. Europe or North/South America, with some sort of ancient connection to the Holy Roman Empire or north Germany.  (My family is mostly Dutch/Scottish with a bit of German ancestry.)  Even the few Turks in the schools (the vast majority are sent home) were as White as the native-born kids  &mdash;   probably descended from kidnapped Balkans or Germans impressed into the Ottoman Empire.  Germany, and Alpen Austria even more so, is a White nation that&rsquo;ll stay White.  My wife and I have 2 small children and a third on the way, and in my daughter&rsquo;s preschool, more than 80% of the kids are non-White.  I don&rsquo;t want her or my son to grow up as minorities in a once-Western land, and I&rsquo;ve honestly considered joining my cousin in Thuringia (German classes come cheap these days).  Honestly, again I&rsquo;m wondering  &mdash;   is this the only practical option to bring up our kids?  What other practical choices do we have, when not only the UK and Australia, but North America itself is being inundated by the Global South, by neoliberal politicians who control all the parties and the media?</p>

			<p>It really amazes me as to why people don&rsquo;t get it! They ARE criminals when they are here illegally, come into the country under darkness,  get MY social security and free healthcare that I have to pay for. AMERCANS need to speak up,speak what is in their hearts to get the minority of people in OUR country to realize that we cannot sustain the rest of the world. I am an AMERCAN, not a hyphenated AMERICAN that speaks loudly when wrongs are commited.Wake up AMERICA, we will be a third world country before we know it. More to come.</p>

			<p>&#8221; &#8216;they were under tremendous pressure from the right of the Republican Party to look tough on immigration enforcement,&#8220;&#8216;he said. &#8216;The law enforcement strategy was hijacked by the politics of the day.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Political pressure works! All those emails, letters, and phone calls to members of Congress paid off!</p>
<p>I like Mexico and Mexicans, and the effect on them of the policy makes me sad, but it&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s got to be. </p>

<p><br>
It seem Los Angeles is once again singled out.  i thought such a place so full of &#8220;diversity&#8221; would never see illegal immigration problems.  The History Channels &#8220;gangland&#8221; series cant find enough latino gangs in LA to talk about. Janet Napolitano is from arizona maybe she can understand illegal immigration issues better than other politicians. Too bad ICE will never be capable of making enough arrests to actually have an effect, but at least they are trying.</p>

<p>I agree, but at the same time it is the system of cushy welfare that attracts them like magnets.</p>
<p>This article states it very well: &#8220;Social atomization comes from exterior factors such as globalization, government misplacement, multiculturalism, and of course, the modern welfare state.</p>
<p>In order to increase tribal bonds we must return to a principled faith-based lifestyle, with strict in-group breeding patterns.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going through the same predicament only our kids are in college now.  We&rsquo;re in our 50s and planning on retiring outside the US because we don&rsquo;t feel any area will be safe here in 20 years.  I don&rsquo;t know where you get this illusion that the UK and Australia are ahead of the US. Both countries are over 90% White, in fact they are Whiter than the US has ever been. Nationalist groups in these countries are growing by leaps and bounds so expect to see some kind of political change in the next 5 years or so.  As for America, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.  The population is 60.9 percent White (European) and it is decreasing rapidly. I think this election has jolted me into realizing that White America is not united enough to form a nationalist party.  The economic collapse might greatly slow down the number of immigrants coming into the country and pressure the government to deport illegals taking scarce jobs.  I don&rsquo;t know.  The country is far too diverse anyhow for my taste having grown up in the 1960s America.  We travel quite a bit and have been to Europe, Australia but we may be setting our sights on a White country in South America.  The cost of living is low and we could live like a king on our pensions. We looked into it and would be very difficult for an American to emigrate to Europe or Australia unless you have a skill that there is a critical shortage in.   </p>

			<p>At what point did we allow liberals to convince the Nation that being in the country illegally is, somehow, not breaking the law? Every time I hear a liberal or Mexican rights-worker mention illegal immigrants who &#8220;aren&rsquo;t criminals&#8221; my head wants to explode. </p>

			<p>Has anyone else noticed that every week or so a poster comes along claiming:<br>
1. America, Britain, Canada, Australia are on the verge of &#8220;white minority&#8221; status and are irredeemable, and<br>
2. Implying that whites should emigrate to &#8220;solidly white&#8221; Germany/Switzerland/Austria?</p>
<p>You <i>do</i> realise that skepticism of &#8220;diversity&#8221; rises proportionate to how much of the community is &#8220;diverse&#8221; i.e. non-white?</p>

			<p>Friends, we have been experiencing America&rsquo;s problems for decades. Until we channel our anger into something constructive and meaningful, something that produces a measurable outcome, we will always be merely a group of complainers who accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>What I suggest we do is organize and selectively boycott specific businesses in an organized way. We have to act as one for the effort to work. For example, if we decided to boycott ExxonMobil this year, we need to do en masse. It would be helpful if AmRen and the Council of Conservative Citizens helped to coordinate this event on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Friends we really need to do this to make a difference for our cause. The government, politicians, companies, merchants, and advertisers dismiss White people out of hand because we do not act in any organized way. We always take it and never fight back by withholding our patronage. </p>
<p>Blacks vote along racial lines. Hispanics vote for Democrats. The Republican Party has become the new Democratic Party, featuring Blacks as the new stars. To combat this, we must organize and decide that we will not purchase from [insert offensive company here] for a selected period of time. We have to make them take notice! Not buying their products will cause big waves if we act in large numbers.</p>
<p>Pick a single, large company each month and target them for a year. Make it the &#8220;secret code&#8221; of our race. </p>
<p>The underground slogan would be something like, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like the way things are going in America, do something about. Join us by not shopping at X for a year!&#8221;</p>
<p>Put them out of business!!!</p>
<p>The time for talking is long-since over. Let&rsquo;s organize an act! It&rsquo;s our constitutional right (for now).</p>
<p>What say ye? Come on!!!!!!!!!!<br>

			<p>Kevin, as a Briton who has myself been about the world, I can tell you that the UK is a demographic house of cards on the verge of collapse. It is certainly not 90% white  &mdash;   an old figure from the 2000 census, well before the recent immigration wave. The Lib-Lab-Con con-artists who run Britain have utterly lost track of demographic statistics and deliberately so. They routinely downplay the demographic onslaught in the midst of an economic crisis so as to give false reassurance to a frustrated electorate. If you look at more reliable numbers from housing starts, maternity units or even the occasional quango that miraculously surveys the needs of its local fief, you&rsquo;ll find that the white proportion has shrunk to maybe 75% of the population and in England itself, well below 70% already, much like the USA but declining far faster. One reason white English women marry African or Caribbean men in such staggering numbers (accelerating the process), is that the white young adult population has been depleted so precipitously. The rest of us can see this, and most of my university mates are getting our permanent exit visas from the UK as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Also as others here have perceived, the leading indicator is in the schools, and in the nurseries and youth interaction programmes (as some children are sequestered from the schools). This tells the future of the country, and it is bleak for England in particular  &mdash;   schools and youth programmes throughout England, indeed in the countryside as in the cities, have overwhelmingly taken on a non-white character, so much so that the English people are routinely harangued about &#8220;adjusting to a non-white England&#8221; in our &#8220;mongrel nation.&#8221; (As though Scandinavian Normans and Danes had a drop&rsquo;s worth of difference from Anglo-Saxon-Jutes compared to Indians, Pakistanis or Ghanaians.) The culture in England has become a Stalinist police state, a suffocating PC prison, pushed not only by Lib-Lab-Con but also by the BBC and all other major news outlets. Sadly, they will never let the BNP gain power, and that includes the &#8220;conservative&#8221; media  &mdash;   Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s rags, as well as the Telegraph, Daily Mail all excoriate the BNP even more than the Guardian does. Besides, due to Parliamentary arcana that I won&rsquo;t bore you with here, the Westminster electoral procedure guts parties like the BNP at the outset unlike in say, Denmark or Holland where they can gain real representation and power.</p>
<p>Obscuratus: If there are frequent reports of things like this, have you considered that it&rsquo;s perhaps because there is some truth to the observations, easily seen by anyone? Because there is. I would suspect that many drawn to AR are travelling overseas workers since we can see the West comparatively and see firstly, how dire our straits are as a people and second, how a variety of nations are faring demographically.These facts are obvious to any of us. I would not quite put Australia in the same dismal category as England, but it too is in dire danger. The dirty little secret of John Howard&rsquo;s tenure as PM is that, despite outward appearances, Howard presided over an unprecedented increase of African, SE and South Asian immigration to Australia, with Rudd having since opened the floodgates. Not just Sudanese but Somalis and Tanzanians have flooded Victoria, and Brisbane, South Australia and even much of Perth are changing just the same: Due to murky &#8220;special labour negotiations&#8221; with Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and many other countries, Australia&rsquo;s cities and countryside are thereby permanently changing. My mates who left the UK for Australia have been disgusted (with this, and also with the yob culture there as in the UK, and cost of living), and many now seek yet a third home. I have only been briefly to central Europe following a crash-course business German class (to Basel, Vienna and Freiburg on a short assignment) and whilst I made only cursory observations and could not really communicate well, there is indeed a marked demographic difference there: a white population as numerous and sturdy as anywhere, not only in the pubs but in the schools and playgrounds. For my part, my employer is shipping me out to Asuncion in South America for my next job assignment, so I can perhaps give an on-the-ground report about things there when I&rsquo;m settled in.<br>

			<p>The problem is that a lot of whites still don&rsquo;t get it.  They don&rsquo;t realize that non-whites are deep down not our friends.  They&rsquo;re direct competitors for resources, jobs, etc.  I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s going to take to change people&rsquo;s mindset.</p>

<p>Germany does have millions of immigrants, but they&rsquo;re almost all ethnic Germans, Dutch, Anglo-Saxons, Norwegians, or other Nordics (esp. Balto-Slavic peoples) from E. Europe or North/South America, with some sort of ancient connection to the Holy Roman Empire or north Germany. (My family is mostly Dutch/Scottish with a bit of German ancestry.) Even the few Turks in the schools (the vast majority are sent home) were as White as the native-born kids &mdash;  probably descended from kidnapped Balkans or Germans impressed into the Ottoman Empire</p>
<p>HAHAHAHA, kidnapped Balkans or Germans :) Turks are as white as most Europeans, more white than Russians and Finns who has significant Uralic/Mongloid admixture (not visible in Phenotype) or New Worlders with tiny black or Amerindian admixture.</p>
<p>My brother would look extremely white to you, far more white than deep brunet Southern Italians (who are of course white, too) and we have absoulutely no foreign admixture (100% Turkish). </p>
<p>There are millions of people who are anthropologically white but has darker skin color, surely an adaptation to the sunshine.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But new data released Wednesday showed that 73% of the nearly 97,000 people arrested by the fugitive operations teams between 2003 and early 2008 did not have criminal records, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with this.  Also, remember, being arrested and detained does not mean deportation.  It simply means years of hearings all paid for by the taxpayer.  The hearings generally do not end in deportation,  Occasionally the illegal is deported, but is often back in America within a year.</p>

<p>AND! in most cases of ordered deportation, the DEPORTEE is simply TOLD to leave the country, whether the deportee does so or not, no longer appears to be of any concern to the courts.</p>

			<p>Has anyone else noticed that every week or so a poster comes along claiming:<br>
1. America, Britain, Canada, Australia are on the verge of &ldquo;white minority&rdquo; status and are irredeemable, and<br>
2. Implying that whites should emigrate to &ldquo;solidly white&rdquo; Germany/Switzerland/Austria?<br>
 You do realise that skepticism of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; rises proportionate to how much of the community is &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; i.e. non-white?<br>
 <br>
 To the above poster, just look at the track record of non-white countries. Now, tell me, outside of Asians, what is the track record of non-white countries? Go ahead, I&rsquo;ll wait. We really do not fault people for being partial to their own, that is natural. It is the backlash against anything white that is so hypocritical. Just look at the backlash in Zimbabwe, that worked well. South Africa is just a decade away, if that. It is audacious that you have Black networks, Black media, etc. Media based on color. Go to Africa, there are seperate countries who, when they go up against each other, have different identities. I went to a college with alot of African students. Their countries are their identity. White networks are mixed, they have to be. Do you see that with Black networks? No, so guess who the real racists are? It is not just those of the African persuasion. The Latin countries have demonstrated nothing but chaos for centuries. We do not want that influence either. Those of us with European ancestry will someday change course and wake up. These things go in cycles. Everyone, regardless of race, knows who causes most of the violent crime and who is the most stable. Statistics say everything. Those of us with fair skin have just as much a right to stand up as you do. So, if Portland need diversity because it is too White, why doesn&rsquo;t Detroit, Atlanta, or Memphis need diversity because they are too Black? San Antonio and Los Angeles are too Hispanic, don&rsquo;t they need diversity,too? <br>

			<p>Clearly the United States is past the demographic tipping point. Even if all immigration, legal and illegal, were halted today, Whites will still become minorities here. I believe it will happen before the year 2020. Of children under 6 years old, Whites are already minorities. Because of welfare, poor people are paid to have children, then we wonder where all these poor people came from. I know my formerly mostly WHite town is getting  inundated with Section 8, to the point where wide swaths are dangerous ghettos.  White kids are routinely beaten on the way back and forth from school.  I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is. Clearly it&rsquo;s not political, since our elected officials appear to dance to the tune of their Globalist Masters.</p>

			<p>Earl of Wright:</p>
<p>I first stated noticing comments like this a few weeks after I found out about A.R. - except&#8221;<br>
* <i>All</i> (formerly majority-white) nations in the British Commonwealth (i.e. the British Isles, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) were on the verge of &#8220;precipitous demographic collapse&#8221;, and<br>
* The authors would mention that France and Italy &#8220;might&#8221; survive, and also suggested emigration to &#8220;white&#8221; Argentina/Uruguay.</p>
<p>But you find&hellip;nothing skeptical about the surprisingly <i>similiar</i> tales of how wonderfully white Germany is after visiting expatriate friends with a &#8220;German grandparent&#8221; that emigrated to Germany?</p>

<p>I agree with you on that. Anyway, it very has much to do with the religion. </p>
<p>By the way, many people who are supposed to be &#8220;Turks&#8221; aren&rsquo;t ethnically Turkish, but Arab, Kurd, Assyrian, mostly from the deprived, uneducated, poor southwest of Turkey. Believe me, those people cause problems in the Western Turkey, too e.g. honor killings, large families, no birth control, vandalism such as setting cars on fire, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>But only the poor, uneducated people do migrate. Why should the rich leave his/her country where he/she lives?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Thuringia is in Central Germany. It is a former DDR state but It has NEVER been in SE Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to Erfurt (in Thuringen) back in 1999 for a conference. Strictly speaking I guess it&rsquo;s &#8220;E Central Germany&#8221; but some of the memos called it &#8220;SE Germany,&#8221; I guess much like some people call North Carolina part of the &#8220;SE USA&#8221; even though it&rsquo;s technically more like &#8220;E Central USA&#8221; when you consider Florida. The geography in eastern Germany is weird as it wicks around the way it does, so I guess some might call at least a portion of Thuringen &#8220;SE Germany.&#8221; (As far as seeking out a solid European country to raise your kids, I&rsquo;d say Austria is even better than Germany is  &mdash;   many of these smaller countries, Switzerland in particular, are not just solidly European but also favorable towards gun ownership, and Austria even has nationalist leadership, as an Amren article itself recently pointed out: <a href="/ar/2008/12/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2008/12/index.html</a>  Having to speak German seems like a small price for what you gain.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who thinks Turks are White should watch the video of Obama in Berlin during the election campaign. It&rsquo;s pretty obvious from the crowd who is Turkish and who is German.&#8221;</p>
<p>It depends, though I agree they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed in appreciable numbers, especially into Nordic nations. On a separate stop in Berlin, I went to some Turkish kiosk stands and most of those Turks could definitely pass as Greeks or Italians, but there was a noticeable difference from the natives as Anonymous is saying.  (For whatever reason, the Turks I&rsquo;ve met in Britain do look more &#8220;Arab&#8221;  &mdash;   probably just some artifact of whatever villages they&rsquo;re emigrating from.) OTOH, I ran into a family of Turks at a plaza in Berlin whom I&rsquo;d assumed to be just native-born German Berliners  &mdash;   the woman had sort of dirty-blonde hair (clearly not tinted) and greenish eyes, and the man had reddish hair and blue eyes. When we swapped names and I realized their Turkish origin, they both told me they were from outside Ankara in Turkey. I even ran into a blonde Turk working in a swimming pool there  &mdash;   there was something about her face that suggested a different origin (around her eyes  &mdash;   she was very, very pretty in any case), but she was more or less in the spectrum of that Slavo-Germanic appearance you see a lot in eastern Germany.</p>
<p>FWIW, the numbers do matter which makes this probably a side issue anyway  &mdash;   Germany&rsquo;s policies toward the Turks have changed radically in the past decade, and the Turkish presence in Germany has been sharply reduced and is tightly restricted. (The flow&rsquo;s shifted more to Britain, last I heard.) And I agree with Samdueb, it&rsquo;s more the cultural outlook that matters, which is why the tough restrictions by Germany (and even more so by Austria and Switzerland) on Turkish migration are critically important  &mdash;   only very, very small numbers should ever be allowed into a Western nation, if that.  It&rsquo;s good to see that the Germans have joined their more nationalistic colleagues in Austria, Denmark and Cyprus, and even in France, in strongly opposing Turkey joining the EU, probably because they understand that the sheer numbers of migrating Turks would overwhelm their countries. It makes me angry to see Britain betraying its European brethren by supporting Turkish accession as they are  &mdash;   the UK has been the biggest advocate of Turkey in the EU, even as the French of all people have been saying no way. What are they thinking? Maybe because the UK really is going Third World on us, at least if my last trip to Manchester was an indication&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated about the ethnography of the Turkish people and especially of those who emigrate (at least in small numbers) to the West. Over the past 15 years, most of the Turks in Germany were summarily sent home, and even now most of those who can&rsquo;t hack it are told to leave or find a third country. (Germany does still have &#8220;blood connections laws&#8221; like Korea and Japan, which favor inflows of Germanics overseas, and wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in other countries.) It&rsquo;s possible that this &#8220;selective filter&#8221; tends to select for those Turks who have more of a European background to begin with and can sync with the culture, which perhaps explains part of the difference in appearances between the Turks I encountered in Germany (some of whom were even Christian) and elsewhere in the West. Historically, Asia Minor was Greek since Alexander the Great&rsquo;s administration, with its population mostly Greek, Balkan, Slavic, and even Germanic (the Varangian guards were Vikings). The &#8220;Turks&#8221; who captured Constantinople had many Europeans among them, since the original Turkish invaders had taken so many casualties, and there there is the issue of all those kids from Balkans impressed into Turkish service.</p>
<p>For example, a quick glance of some models from Turkey  &mdash;   https://www.jurgita.com/models/turkish-models   &mdash;   they look pretty European here. Of course, models aren&rsquo;t representative of the population at large, but some photos at a recent demonstration  &mdash;   https://www.seyvet.com/foto/10477   &mdash;   confirm some variation in the population, i.e. at least a fraction of Turks do look very European. Again, it&rsquo;s all about the numbers. A tiny, tiny trickle (preferably of well-educated Turks and even Christian if possible) is probably manageable, but Turkey joining the EU (as Britain still advocates) would be a historic disaster and would probably overwhelm Christian Europe with a Muslim majority, which is why Austria, Germany, France, Denmark and Cyprus are right to band together in opposing it. OTOH, Germany seems to have been smart about its own policies  &mdash;   limiting the Turkish presence to very low and declining numbers, and setting the bar high enough that even that tiny trickle of Turks hails from perhaps the more &#8220;European&#8221; fraction of the Anatolian population.<br>

			<p>I am beginning to think the best course of action for me, in the very near future, is to identify the most desolate, 100 percent White area I can find in a northen U.S. mountain area; One with harsh winters and no attraction for minorities for a few hundred miles around. Then, auction off everything I own except for my clothes and one car and move to my new town. I figure I could spend $100,000 on property and a very small, used home where ever I settle and still have about $350,000 in the bank in the form of CDs and maybe an annuity. I would definitely not have a phone, or TV, or Internet. I could read novels and sit on my back porch and look at the mountains. I&rsquo;d pray each day that nothing ever happens to attact undesirables into my new town. I think that would be a much happier life than seeing the news of America transforming into Africa or Latin America each day.</p>
<p>America is cursed.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s sad is your infatuation with Asian muslims.  If you think White means middle eastern features, black hair and skin that varies from beige to brown, then you must not be White either. Find some panaryan website that will accept your kind. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re thinking of Idaho, the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming etc.  Unfortunately, the federal government owns about 80 percent of the land in those areas.</p>
<p>Maybe the EEOC and other federal anti white gestapo agencies will allow us to live there, but remember, the anti white feds own the land.</p>
<p>Maybe marry an Indian, (full blood) and get one of those reservation resident by marriage tribal certificates.</p>

			<p>Chances are that if ICE agents physically locate an illegal immigrant with outstanding warrants/rap sheets, it&rsquo;s going to be in a house, a car, a dive, or a workplace and chances are that the subject of the warrant will be in the company of one or more other illegal immigrants who do not have outstanding orders for arrest. (and others who do) So it&rsquo;s not hard to assign attribution to most of the 73% warrantless IAs rounded up by ICE. </p>
