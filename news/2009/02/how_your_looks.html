<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First impressions are highly influential, despite the well-worn admonition not to judge a book by its cover. Within a tenth of a second of seeing an unfamiliar face we have already made a judgement about its owner&rsquo;s character  &mdash;  caring, trustworthy, aggressive, extrovert, competent and so on (Psychological Science, vol 17, p 592). Once that snap judgement has formed, it is surprisingly hard to budge. What&rsquo;s more, different people come to strikingly similar conclusions about a particular face  &mdash;  as shown in our own experiment (see &#8220;The New Scientist face experiment&#8221;).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is there any substance to such snap judgements? Are dominant-looking people really more dominant? Are baby-faced people naive? Are we electing the most competent leaders, or simply people who look the part? As psychologist Alexander Todorov of Princeton University points out, the fact that different people come to remarkably similar conclusions about a particular face is very different from saying there is a correspondence between a face and something real in an individual&rsquo;s personality.</p>
<p>There is, however, some tantalising evidence that our faces can betray something about our character. In 1966, psychologists at the University of Michigan asked 84 undergraduates who had never met before to rate each other on five personality traits, based entirely on appearance, as they sat for 15 minutes in silence (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, vol 4, p 44). For three traits  &mdash;  extroversion, conscientiousness and openness  &mdash;  the observers&rsquo; rapid judgements matched real personality scores significantly more often than chance.</p>
<p>More recently, researchers have re-examined the link between appearance and personality, notably Anthony Little of the University of Stirling and David Perrett of the University of St Andrews, both in the UK. They pointed out that the Michigan studies were not tightly controlled for confounding factors: the participants could have been swayed by posture, movement, clothing and so on. But when Little and Perrett re-ran the experiment using mugshots rather than live subjects, they also found a link between facial appearance and personality  &mdash;  though only for extroversion and conscientiousness (Social Cognition, vol 24, p 607).</p>
<p>While these experiments suggest that our snap judgements of faces really do contain a kernel of truth about the personality of their owner, Little stresses that the link is far from clear-cut. He and Perrett only found a correlation at the extremes of personality, and other studies looking for links with different aspects of personality have failed to find any association at all. The owner of an &#8220;honest&#8221; face, for example, is no more likely to be trustworthy than anyone else.</p>
<p>What is also not fully understood is why we make facial judgements so readily. Is there an evolutionary advantage to judging books by their covers? Little suggests that because these judgements are so rapid and consistent  &mdash;  and because they can indeed reveal aspects of personality  &mdash;  it is likely that evolution has honed us to pick up on the signals.</p>
<p>Support for this, and the kernel of truth idea, has come from a study of 90 ice-hockey players published late last year by Justin Carré and Cheryl McCormick of Brock University in Ontario, Canada. They found that a wider face in which the cheekbone-to-cheekbone distance was unusually large relative to the distance between brow and upper lip was linked in a statistically significant way with the number of penalty minutes a player was given for violent acts including slashing, elbowing, checking from behind and fighting (Proceedings of the Royal Society B, vol 275, p 2651).</p>
<p>Testosterone-fuelled</p>
<p>They also found a link between the facial width-to-height ratio and the male sex hormone testosterone. According to the results of a recent pilot study by Carré, men with wider faces have higher testosterone concentrations in their saliva.</p>
<p>The critical  &mdash;  and as yet unanswered  &mdash;  question is whether people judge men with wider faces as more aggressive. McCormick and Carré are studying this, and though the results are not all in, McCormick says a preliminary analysis suggests that they do.</p>
<p>If this pans out, it would mean that men with high testosterone levels, who are known to be bigger, stronger and more dominant, are more likely to have rounder faces  &mdash;  and that we evolved to judge such faces as aggressive because their owners are more likely to attack us. Carré stresses, however, that the face is only one of many cues that we use to read the intentions of others. &#8220;It is not the be all and end all of assessing people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kernel of truth idea isn&rsquo;t the only explanation on offer for our readiness to make facial judgements. Leslie Zebrowitz, a psychologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, says that in many cases snap judgements are not accurate. Our readiness to judge books by their covers, she says, is often an &#8220;overgeneralisation&#8221; of a more fundamental response (Social and Personality Psychology Compass, vol 2, p 1497).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Todorov and Oosterhof conclude that personality judgements based on people&rsquo;s faces are an overgeneralisation of our evolved ability to infer emotions from facial expressions, and hence a person&rsquo;s intention to cause us harm and their ability to carry it out (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol 105, p11087).</p>
<p>Todorov, however, stresses that overgeneralisation does not rule out the idea that there is sometimes a kernel of truth in these assessments of personality. &#8220;I would not say there is no accuracy at all in these judgements, particularly in the case of dominance,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is not the case that overgeneralisation and kernel of truth ideas are mutually exclusive.&#8221;</p>

The brain of every successful animal has incorporated the capacity to immediately draw broad conclusions about every and any situation.</p>
<p>No animal could survive if they were expected to adhere to human driven politically correct rules such as not to judge people or to take the time to really get to know someone.</p>
<p>Try to teach those insane ideas to a deer living in wolf or cougar country.</p>
<p>I trust my gut instincts every time. And if blacks really believed the idea that whites were as evil and dangerous as their insticts tell them, they wouldn&rsquo;t want to be near whites at any moment in time. Funny how they want to live in the lions den with the lion.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting article, consistent with what can be easily observed in everyday&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The problem is that this kind of statistical reasoning based on someone&rsquo;s face is considered by some bigotry if not outright discrimination.</p>
<p>I can recognize a recently arrived Mexican illegal &#8220;immigrant&#8221; in a heartbeat by looking in his face, and so can, probably, any law enforcement officer. But the apprehensions based on appearance are rare as the law enforcement bureaucrats don&rsquo;t want to risk a lawsuit charging them with &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;.</p>
<p>Profiling is a useful evolutionary advantage, indeed, assuming that one is allowed to use it. And the prognoses for future look rather grim.</p>

I have long been intrigued by this phenomenon, specifically in the area of intelligence.  In my experience, people who &#8220;look&#8221; intelligent almost invariably are. Peole who look a bit dumb almost invariably are.</p>
<p>There is also scientific backing for it. For example, we associate wearing glasses with intelligence (it&rsquo;s a mild association, but it exists). Jensen&rsquo;s book, The G Factor, points out that myopia correlates moderately with IQ. </p>
<p>I bet these researchers don&rsquo;t have the guts to look at <i>this</i> topic.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;d say there is a predisposition to judge those with even features positively. This makes sense in that those with significantly uneven (asymmetric) features are more likely to be both physically and mentally ill, or at least more vulnerable to illness.</p>

			<p>From my experience, it&rsquo;s true in almost ALL cases. I work in a job where I see customers before I get to talk with them, and I see them many times thereafter, and almost always, my first impression, from a distance of twenty or thirty feet, is right.<br>
Criminals are easy to spot. A dishonest person cannot hide their evil. <br>
Every night, when you go to sleep, your dreams reveal your true personality, and your face will adopt the expressions you are using in your dreams. If you spend every night being aggressive, etc. then your facial muscles will become set in that expression, no matter how &#8216;nice&rsquo; you pretend to be while awake. <br>
I&rsquo;ve always judged a book by its cover, and I well remember having a conversation with several work colleagues about this, most of whom claimed that they couldn&rsquo;t tell somebody&rsquo;s personality this way, but I think they must have been lying to be &#8216;politically correct&rsquo;, and not to appear judgemental. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, why not? Only your ENEMY would tell you not to look out for yourself, not to be suspicious of people who look evil, etc. <br>
Just like our politically correct masters keep telling us, not to &#8216;discriminate&rsquo;, etc.etc. Because they are our enemies.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many women say I knew within 10 seconds whether or not I would date that person. It&rsquo;s emotions based on endocrinal reponses nothing more. People should use their heads more than their feelings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not because the like the lion. They don&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s because they like the lion&rsquo;s comfy DEN and the lion&rsquo;s good food. They would be very happy to do without the lion&hellip;. if they could.</p>
<p><br>
This could better be re-phrased in terms of geese.  They don&rsquo;t especially like the Golden Goose, but they sure do like those Golden Eggs.   Unfortunately for them, the eggs don&rsquo;t come without the goose.</p>
<p>What a dilemma!</p>

I heartily agree.  Goodlooks, while not precisely the same thing, generally equate with good health.  Clear skin, shiny hair, energetic step, etc. are all indicators of good health. <br>
 <br>
Aside from Romantic Era novels of cosumptive beauties like Camille   &mdash;   a notion which was just a passing fashion of the day   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s hard to picture a sickly beauty.  While it&rsquo;s not entirely impossible, that person&rsquo;s &#8220;beauty&#8221; would not be due to his/her illness, but in spite of it.  Good genes and bone structure would still show through. But imagine how much MORE beautiful that sickly beauty would be in the full bloom of health.<br>

<p>People who caution you against judging a book by its cover are invariably those who worry that you might look too closely and discover what&rsquo;s within.</p>

Follow-up:</p>
<p>Many people will deny that a correlation exists. But the people who deny it might have some aspect of their own looks that they aren&rsquo;t happy with. They go through life hoping that this correlation isn&rsquo;t true, because it makes them worse off.</p>
<p>It requires a certain amount of courage to look in the mirror, not like something you see, and still face life in an honest and positive manner.<br>

<p>This is actually a pretty interesting comment, considering that we spend (or should spend) about 1/3 of our lives asleep.  Add to that the immense time we spend alone, like getting ready for work, taking showers, brushing our teeth, driving back and forth, and other situations where we aren&rsquo;t really interacting with the public, then it seem the face WOULD begin to look the way a person really is.  It might significantly correlate to the amount of time we aren&rsquo;t actually &#8220;on&#8221; for others.</p>

			<p>Just throwing in my 2 cents here. I know this guy. I really don&rsquo;t know what it wrong with him, but a lot of people think he is a criminal. In particular, they say he is a child molester. I don&rsquo;t know why they say this. I guess they think he *looks* like a child molester. Another common opinion is that he is an extremely dangerous person, so dangerous that a number of people don&rsquo;t want to be around him, and there has been an attempt to ban him from a store. </p>
<p>He recently moved to a new town, in part to escape this stuff, and it started right up again. The people in the new town quickly started saying he was a child molester, a criminal, a predator and a serial killer. There were attempts to ban him from another store on grounds of dangerousness.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very upset about this, and he is frantically trying to figure out how to stop people from thinking this about him, but I think it&rsquo;s probably hopeless.</p>
<p>The truth is this guy is probably the most harmless person on the face of the Earth. He&rsquo;s simply incapable of hurting you or doing anything aggressive to anyone unprovoked. He has no criminal record of victimizing others in any way and he&rsquo;s 40 years old. He&rsquo;s also scrupulously honest and conscientious and has extremely high morals. He won&rsquo;t rip you off, use you or really hurt you in any way. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very introverted and I think neurotic and he&rsquo;s kind of weird. He has a funny stare and looks distracted. He&rsquo;s also one of the smartest people I have ever known. I guess that&rsquo;s the source of the nonsense. </p>
<p>This episode, and innumerable others I have witnessed down through the years, shows me that our ability to judge dangerousness is seriously flawed. Maybe not a lot of false negatives, but surely tons of false positives. </p>
