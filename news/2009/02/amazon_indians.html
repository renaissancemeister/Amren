<h1>Amazon Indians Accused of Cannibalizing Farmer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helena DeMoura, CNN, February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering, butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism.</p>
<p>The village&rsquo;s chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho, 19, last week on the outskirts of Envira, which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No arrest warrants were issued. Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands, Portal Amazonia reported.</p>
<p>It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual, although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution, the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported.</p>
<p>Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village.</p>
<p>&#8220;They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another. They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again,&#8221; Clementino said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The family decided to go into the reservation and that&rsquo;s when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree. It was very tragic for the family,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves, who apparently bragged about eating the man&rsquo;s organs, Clementino said.</p>
<p>Members of the tribe told residents of Envira  &mdash;  where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians  &mdash;  that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim&rsquo;s organs, Clementino said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to FUNAI [Brazil&rsquo;s National Indian Foundation.], about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil&rsquo;s Acre state, which borders with Peru, where 450 Kulina live. This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes.</p>
<p>The Kulina are classified as an &#8220;isolated&#8221; tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population.</p>

			<p>Several cannibals were recently hired by a big corporation. &ldquo;You are all part of our team now,&rdquo; said the HR rep during the welcoming briefing. &ldquo;You get all the usual benefits and you can go to the cafeteria for something to eat, but please don&rsquo;t eat any of the other employees&rdquo;. The cannibals promised.</p>
<p>Four weeks later their boss remarked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all working very hard and I&rsquo;m satisfied with you. However, one of our secretaries has disappeared. Do any of you know what happened to her?&rdquo; The cannibals all shook their heads no.</p>
<p>After the boss had left, the leader of the cannibals said to the others, &ldquo;Which one of you idiots ate the secretary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hand raised hesitantly, to which the leader of the cannibals continued, &ldquo;You fool! For four weeks we&rsquo;ve been eating Managers and no one noticed anything, then you had to go and eat the secretary!&rdquo;<br>

			<p>A traveler wandering on an island inhabited entirely by cannibals comes upon a butcher shop. This shop specialized in human brains. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>
The sign in the shop read: </p>
<p>Brain Type  Price per Pound  <br>
Artist Brains  $ 9.00 <br>
Philosopher Brains  $12.00  <br>
Scientist Brains  $15.00  <br>
Liberal Brains  $29.00  </p>
<p>Upon reading the sign, the traveler noted, &#8220;My, those liberal brains must be quite tasty!&#8221; </p>
<p>The butcher replied, &#8220;Are you kidding? Do you have any idea how many liberals you have to kill to get a pound of brains?&#8221; <br>

			<p>Cannibal Indians? Here I thought only Africans enjoyed that kind of meal? Like those &#8220;soldiers&#8221; using cannibalism as a terror tactic. Or those rebels who were feasting on pygmies&hellip; the pygmies having been in the news for appealing to the United Nations for help (protection against becoming the main course).</p>

			<p>Two cannibals are eating a clown, when one of them grimmaces and puts the meat down, refusing to eat any more.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong?&#8221; asks the other cannibal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It tastes funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannibalism has not been historically confined to Africa, Fed Up.  In fact, it has a bit of a tradition among some Amerind groups.  The word &#8220;cannibal&#8221; is one we got from the Arawak Indian language, along with &#8220;hurricane&#8221;, &#8220;barbecue&#8221; and &#8220;hammock&#8221;.  Their neighbors, the Caribs were notorious cannibals, and wiped the Arawaks who had survived the diseases the Spanish introduced.  Some US southwest Indian tribes - the Hopi and Navajo, I believe - have claimed off and on that the Pueblo Indians (also known as the Anasazi) were once cannibals, but the charge of eating humans is one the Pueblo hotly deny.  Among the Pueblo, it may have been an act of desperation; it is known that the Pueblo abandoned their cities and cliff-dwellings (like those at Mesa Verde in Colorado) during the climate change associated with the mini ice-age, which must have caused major crop failures (they grew corn, pumpkins, tomatoes and the like) and severe hardship.  </p>
<p>Cannibalism also became famous in New Guinea, and may account for the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller, although the real culprit is just as likely to have been a large saltwater crocodile (these are extremely dangerous, and claim many human victims each year).</p>
<p>In the historic past, Taiwan and mainland China have had cannibal groups, including, I believe, the ethnic Hakka (sp?)  The Picts of Scotland were also once cannibals, until Saint Columba, who had traveled there from Ireland,  converted King Angus to Christianity and convinced him to have his subjects stop eating folks.</p>

			<p>While Indians are and have been into cannibalism, let&rsquo;s not forget the African rebels, recently in the news for this same trait. Using cannibalism as a terror tactic, to instill fear into their enemies. Also in the news within the last year&hellip; that African pygmies appealed to the U.N. for protection&hellip; because rebel soldiers were eating pygmies. </p>

			<p>Cannibalism was very widely practiced throughout Brazil by the native tribes living there when the Portuguese first encountered them. And for a long time after.  Maybe not universally, but it was pretty standard.</p>
