			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Wright, Issues &amp; Views &mdash; The Blog, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Who started the lie that the Founders of this nation expended their energies, in order to create a haven for the rescue of the world&rsquo;s displaced populations? Did it come about chiefly from cynical 19th century industrialists eager only for cheap labor, who sought to soften their true motives by wrapping them in sentimental bombast?</p>
<p>Was the lie then perpetuated through the fantasies of some early lucky refugees who found their way to these shores, and who desired to make the path to the Golden Door easier for their family and kin left behind?</p>
<p>Or was the lie deliberately concocted by those who despised the country&rsquo;s powerful and entrenched establishment, with the expectation that making mass immigration a national religious mandate might eventually unglue said establishment?</p>
<p>When restrictive immigration laws were changed in the 1960s, who expected to benefit most from the mass influx that inevitably would begin to stream from around the world?</p>
<p>I ask these questions in light of the New York Times&rsquo; recent [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/opinion/01sun1.html" target="sun">here</a> and <a href="http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/the-nativists-are-restless-continued/?pagemode=print" target="restless">here</a> and <a href="http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/the-nativist-lobby/#comment-145227" target="nativist">here,</a>] denigrating those Americans who campaign, through organizations and modest media outlets, to regain control over our borders, in order to preserve the traditional cultural integrity of the United States. The Times and its comrades share the presumptuous notion that the US is the rightful destination of every conceivable population on earth. They send the word far and wide that, if you&rsquo;re hurting in the land of your birth, then you have a right to alleviate that hurt by transporting yourself to the USA, no matter what stress is put upon the resources of American citizens.</p>
<p>Thanks to our education system and a century of media propaganda, it has become a fixed notion that this country, unlike every other on earth, was put together for the benefit of the world&rsquo;s faceless masses. He who desires entrance must merely claim to share certain ideals, that is, the &#8220;propositions&#8221; contained in the founding documents, with a couple of modern axioms thrown in for good measure. Because of America&rsquo;s &#8220;special&#8221; status, there need be no regard for prevailing social and economic conditions, since the welfare of the existing population is not as important as that of the prospective immigrant. After all, America was founded on nothing more than a bundle of universalist ideas based around themes of freedom; it has no borders and no heritage.</p>
<p>In an earlier post on this blog, &#8220;Farewell to Thomas Jefferson,&#8221; I ask what the likelihood is that any group would form a nation for a people other than their own kind. Why would these men not desire to retain the cultural integrity of their lineage? Other than today&rsquo;s self-consciously de-racinating whites, what people do not possess this very preference? Would the Hutu be likely to expend their energies to develop a society to benefit alien tribes and foreigners? Would the Tamil? Those who claim that the world has now moved beyond ethnocentric loyalty, or ought to, might do well to take a look at the real world.</p>
<p>In that post, I also suggest that the Founders would not be in concert with the platitudes contained in that mawkish poem that was belatedly affixed to the base of the Statue of Liberty. Which Founder envisioned this country&rsquo;s future in the hands of &#8220;huddled masses&#8221; from every nook and cranny of the earth? Certainly not John Jay, who thanked Providence for giving &#8220;this one connected country to one united people, a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs.&#8221; That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a proposition to win over the huddled masses to me. Today, is it unreasonable to assume that, for the sake of preserving the Anglo-European institutions on which this country was nurtured, an Anglo-Euro majority should prevail?</p>
<p>The Times&rsquo; editorialists do not seem to blush as they pronounce the outright lie that the United States was &#8220;composed of people without any common national heritage.&#8221; How can they attach the reputation of their once preeminent publication to such a colossal falsehood? Now, if you&rsquo;re out to eliminate the Anglo-European cultural make-up of the US, and are thrilled by the increasingly multiracial polyglot nature of this society, say so. But don&rsquo;t fabricate history, in order to prove that this country was formed in a vacuum by people who shared no heritage.</p>
<p>One would have thought that coping with the real disabilities of the descendants of the country&rsquo;s slaves, as well as accommodating the Hispanics-Latinos, who had always been a presence, would be enough to occupy the administrators of an already multiracial nation. To open the floodgates in the 1960s, ensuring an even greater heterogeneous influx, would seem an act of folly.</p>
<div class="text-center">o&nbsp;o&nbsp;o</div>
<p>In its editorials, the Times cavalierly dismisses the impact of these recent decades of mass immigration on employment. With a wave of the hand, the editorialists imply that immigration reformers are not motivated by concern about jobs since, apparently, to the Times, this is just another &#8220;wedge&#8221; issue, that is, insignificant.</p>
<p>Blacks have known for some time that their leaders  &mdash;  politicians, academics, and varieties of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; bureaucrats  &mdash;  have turned their backs on the struggle against illegal immigration. The primary interest of these dignitaries is the protection of their careers and/or political turf. In <a href="http://www.issues-views.com/index.php?article=948" target="betrayed">Immigration: Betrayal By Black Elites,</a> I outlined the pattern of black leadership organizations (take your pick) and black politicians (take your pick), who eagerly make alliances with the elites of other groups, no matter how detrimental such unions prove to blacks in the long run.</p>
<p>Black politicians like Sheila Jackson-Lee, Maxine Waters and John Conyers seek only to expand their constituent base. As racial demographics change in their districts, they frantically scramble to court and win the confidence of the burgeoning foreigners. The fact that these foreigners, a great many of them illegal, end up displacing Americans, frequently poor blacks, in a shrinking job market is of no concern, either to these representatives of the people, or to the editorialists at the New York Times.</p>
<p>As more and more Americans find themselves laid off or fired from stagnating companies, they discover that even the most modest work has become a scarce commodity. If Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, at a special hearing, is not moved when a black worker informs her of American minorities who have been displaced by illegals as roofers, drywallers and truck drivers, why should the New York Times care?</p>
<div class="text-center">o&nbsp;o&nbsp;o</div>
<p>The Times has joined the bandwagon of those who smear as &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; decent Americans who are seeking genuine solutions to the immigration crisis. Peter Brimelow targets it exactly. He notes that, since the Democrats are made up of a coalition of minorities, they &#8220;must at all costs prevent America&rsquo;s majority from uniting. Hence, the New York Times&rsquo; hysteria.&#8221; (By the way, the &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; tag has now replaced the much over-abused label of &#8220;racist&#8221; as the epithet of choice. Watch for it everywhere.)</p>
<p>To the camp followers of the Times, it is imperative to prevent average white citizens, who are still the majority, from ever uniting in the name of any cause. Preventing an effective immigration reform movement is paramount to those who seek to keep this country&rsquo;s borders wide open. This is certainly one of the reasons why the editors of the Times are spending their energies these days castigating three of the most successful immigration reform organizations  &mdash;  the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), and NumbersUSA. I have followed the outstanding work of each of these groups since their formation, and have always been impressed by the respectful manner in which they handle what has become a volatile subject.</p>
<p>The Times further discredits itself by favorably acknowledging the biased reports and materials disseminated by the spurious Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC is among a handful of self-appointed &#8220;watchdogs,&#8221; a cluster of groups whose creators have mastered the ability to acquire funding by instilling fear and indignation in the general public. Besmirching individuals and groups that work to end illegal immigration as &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobes,&#8221; the SPLC has diligently set about the task of destroying all proponents of restrictive immigration laws.</p>
<p>Traveling under the umbrella of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; or &#8220;human rights,&#8221; these &#8220;watchdog&#8221; groups are represented through a fawning, deferential media as altruistic protectors of society&rsquo;s downtrodden. Depicting themselves as noble champions of &#8220;Anti-racism,&#8221; they spend a great deal of time crusading for the expansion of &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation, that is, laws designed specifically to give government greater control over Americans&rsquo; thoughts and behavior. They have acquired enough political power to behave as quasi-government agencies, and some misguided citizens actually believe that these self-appointed entities, and their executive directors, possess official power.</p>
<p>Two of the major &#8220;watchdogs,&#8221; the SPLC and the B&rsquo;nai Brith Anti-Defamation League, are darlings of the media, because they can be counted on to provide an endless stream of news fillers. Reporters are happy to take the easy way out when supposedly covering a story on race. Just get the press release from the SPLC or ADL on some particular event or individual, copy what it says and, instantly, you have a news item to send to your editor. How often have you seen a news story end with a quote by an SPLC or ADL official denouncing some individual as a &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;white supremacist?&#8221; And we know it&rsquo;s so, because the ADL or <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="splc_does_not_check_for_accuracy">SPLC says it&rsquo;s so!</a></p>
<p>Character assassination is the SPLC&rsquo;s speciality. Its &#8220;link and smear&#8221; tactics are notorious, along with its ever-expanding hit list. Through insinuations, it will link an individual or group to some other group or event that is deemed evil by SPLC standards. It then relentlessly pursues the public destruction of the unfortunate target, all the while sending out poisonous press releases, that are lapped up and quoted by an eager, uninquiring media.</p>
<p>If these watchdogs could make the &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; tag stick to immigration reform organizations, and could frame their leaders with some illegal charge, they would then set about stripping these immigration groups of all their financial resources. Both the ADL and SPLC have done exactly this to other organizations whose racial politics were perceived as &#8220;incorrect.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an in-depth examination of groups like the SPLC, there is nothing better than Laird Wilcox&rsquo;s The Watchdogs: A close look at Anti-Racist &#8220;Watchdog&#8221; Groups. Wilcox has spent over two decades watching the watchdogs and compiling detailed information on their strategies and smear tactics.</p>
<div class="text-center">o&nbsp;o&nbsp;o</div>
<p>If you have been paying attention, you know that the New York Times, like all newspapers, is withering away. You also know that, in a desperate move, its owners recently requested and received a $250 million investment from Mexican businessman Carlos Slim. Some observers are suggesting that the recent attacks by the Times&rsquo; directors on the most high-profile opponents of open borders comes as partial payment to their Mexican benefactor.</p>
<p>If those New York Times editorials are any barometer, the battle to resolve this country&rsquo;s immigration dilemma is going to be an even longer, more acrimonious one.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re on the verge of bankruptcy, and they&rsquo;re losing ad revenue and readers in large numbers, yet they continue on with slanted, bias news stories full of exaggerations and lies which have lost their credibility as an unbiased source of news, yet they don&rsquo;t seem to care, so fanatical is their radical, leftist ideology.</p>
<p>They could cripple on for a few more years before they fold completely, but they need to go now.  For good.  And the oddballs working there need to get into a business they&rsquo;re better qualified for, like washing cars.</p>

			<p>Thank you, Elizabeth Wright.  Ms. Wright is one of the few blacks that truly does see beyond race.  Although she is, no doubt, labelled an Uncle Tom by members of her own, she has the dignity and integrity to speak how she sees things.  Because for Ms. Wright, when the stock of the Founding Fathers vanishes, a large part of the country that she loves and cherishes will vanish with it.  She realizes that part of that culture is her culture, too.  She courageously acknowledges a truth all too often obscured by a boiling cauldron of the rest of the world&rsquo;s unwanted and the traitorous folks that started the fire beneath it.<br>

			<p>Miss Wright need not have written this whole thing save the last two paragraphs.  Carlos Slim&rsquo;s investment explains all.</p>
<p>Also, Peter Brimelow has uncovered a common board member of the NYT company and the SPLC.  I imagine soon the SPLC will be getting money from Carlos Slim.</p>

			<p>When did the lie start? When the statue &#8220;Liberty Enlightening the World&#8221;, now incorrectly called &#8220;The Statue of Liberty&#8221;, was hijacked by the Emma Lazarus poem, &#8220;The New Colossus&#8221;.</p>

<p>A poem is not appropriate immigration policy and such sentiments were never those of our Founding Fathers.<br>

			<p>This is a well written and heartening article. Blacks have a historical claim to America, and if they would join forces with whites on integration, it would be a major step in stopping this headlong march to multi-cultural insanity. The fact that this lady is black adds weight to her message, and the racist rant just won&rsquo;t stick.</p>

			<p>The SPLC, along with the Anti-Defamation League of B&rsquo;nai Brith are two organizations with an incredible amount of power and their political agenda is well-known to White Nationalists and Separatists.</p>
<p>As far as a Blacks are concerned, some of the more intelligent realize that many of these legal immigrants - and also the illegal ones - are much more willing to work than the average Black.  They&rsquo;re filling up the big cities and I&rsquo;m referring to Mexicans, and other Hispanics from Central America, Indians from India, Orientals, Mid-Easterners, Muslims, etc.  All of these groups are displacing Blacks.  They&rsquo;re all more intelligent and all are more willing to work.  This displacement along with the coming depression will fuel the fires of the well-known &#8220;Black Rage&#8221; and there will soon be riots.  And who will get the blame for the poor Black mans&rsquo; plight?  You guessed it - The evil White Man.</p>

			<p>This is the best written counter-attack against the forces seeking to de-legitimize opposition to amnesty and mass non-white immigration I&rsquo;ve yet read.  As Wright implies, there is an intense jockeying for position, the moral high ground, going on in anticipation of the next big push for amnesty and even higher immigration levels. If FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA, the groups which did much of the grunt work and provided all of the technical expertise in leading the great national crusade against amnesty in &#8216;05 &amp; &#8216;06, can be effectively smeared and weakened, then opposition to amnesty and unlimited immigration can be crushed.  Or so the thinking goes.  Let us hope Wright&rsquo;s article, and the efforts of other good hearted people, will prove this thinking wrong. </p>

			<p>Great article by Elizabeth. I liked her quote of John Jay. Too bad most Americans haven&rsquo;t heard it. Our kids sure haven&rsquo;t in the schools we have today. It is also too bad that the White lemmings out there don&rsquo;t say the same thing as Elizabeth does. I always hated that poem by Emma Lazarus on the pedestal of the Statue Of Liberty! She is one of the main reasons so many of the sheeple believe &#8220;we are a nation of immigrants&#8221; no matter where they come from. Also loved the part of the article where she comes out and names the ADL/SOLC and B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith as our problem.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8221;Blacks have a historical claim to America, and if they would join forces with whites on integration&#8221;&#8220;.</p>
<p>Not hardly. I would actually be quite surprised if Ms Wright would support this either. We need to do just the opposite so we can preserve that which makes us uniquely us. Is the guts and underpinning of our founding, laws and way of life. We actually need to quite trying to &#8220;integrate&#8221;. That has been a huge part of the problem all along. We keep trying to cram square pegs into round holes through guilt, &#8220;equality&#8221; and/or force and just can&rsquo;t figure out why it NEVER works. Blacks are not whites and whites are not blacks. Never have been. Just as all others.</p>

			<p>The liberal wing of this Nation will not rest until America has taken the worst of Mexico, Africa and Asia, and left what is best about its own culture to lie in the dustbin of history. Unless we true Americans, in large numbers, begin to support 3rd Parties who truly fight for immigration reform, it is the New York Times and their cronies who shall prevail. They can be stopped, and our culture saved, but only if we Americans remember that &#8220;Democrat&#8221; and &#8220;Republican&#8221; are not the only choices in the ballot-box. </p>

<p>Non-white realize, at least some do, that the countries they come from and the ethnic communities they cling too would never open their arms to the &#8220;huddled masses.&#8221; I find this more difficult to communicate on the internet then Black IQ levels. <br>
People are in denial about diversity and non-white attitudes. </p>

			<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is an absolute, I mean absolute, JOKE. I just finished watching a program on TV hosted by Diane Sawyer, who is also a joke in her twisted news reporting. She showed the poverty that exists in Appalachia, but the twist,(and I knew there would be one)was that Appalachians brought everything on themselves. Even though they never get what illegal aliens do in the way of government help and resources. But my point is this, where is the SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER, when it comes to helping these poor white folk? They&rsquo;d rather go out of business then help poor whites in povety, that&rsquo;s where the Southern Poverty Law center is on the issue of white poverty.</p>

			<p>I think this article is dead on with one exception.&#8221; He who desires entrance must merely claim to share certain ideals&#8221;, but they don&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s get one thing straight, these illegals are here to make money and to take advantage, that&rsquo;s it. They have no interest whatsoever for our laws our heritage or our language.</p>

			<p>   I can&rsquo;t wait to see the newspaper industry go completely under. Hell, I won&rsquo;t even buy my local newspaper. They deserve to go under for their contribution to illegal immigration. They deserve to go under for their part in the destruction of this country and the white people that founded it. </p>

			<p>The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France and so was the inscription. The inscription seems a strange one, coming from France, since so few French citizens moved to the USA&hellip;.at anytime in our history. A gift from France does not define US policy&hellip;.at the time or later in history.</p>
<p>What the Founding Fathers of this nation had in mind is best illustrated by the first labor strike. The first strike on the North American continent was in colonial times by Polish glass blowers (obviously very white). They went on strike to protest the fact that Virginia would not allow them to vote in elections.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is a historical fact. </p>
<p>To suggest that the Founding Fathers (including Jefferson) would allow or encourage tens of millions of Hispanics to invade this country and vote in elections, would make them ALL spin in their graves.</p>

			<p>What is happening in the United States, is that all of the debt is being repackaged to pass on to future generations of &#8220;minorities&#8221;; the new owners of America.</p>
<p>Interesting. The enormous debt will be passed on to the new USA comprised mostly of Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and Asians. They will have enormous debt on their shoulders for the remainder of their lives. They will be forever in the debt of a small clique of Whites. Thank God, as a White man, I have no children to leave behind in the misery and coming coming misery.</p>
<p>Yes, the small clique of White bankers and politicians have betrayed their own race, as they always have, but the people who will really suffer a lifetime of debt for countless generations to come are the Blacks, Browns, Reds, and Yellows who take over America. They are far easier to deceive and manipulate than Whites, that is why they are the new &#8220;owners&#8221; of America.</p>
<p>Think about&hellip; the White bankers/politicians have charged up trillions and trillions of dollars in debt, and they are handing the responsibility off to the &#8220;invading&#8221; minorities. How convenient.</p>

 Is it any wonder that the New York Times has to borrow<br>
at 14 percent interest from Carlos Slim to stay afloat<br>
when its editorials are so obnoxious to so many white<br>
Americans? </p>

			<p>I really hope I&rsquo;m wrong but the US has already reached a tipping point in its demographic situation that cannot be undone even by deporting all the illegals.  White Americans (Europeans) are only 61% of the population now and shrinking.  We have 20-25 years left before we are a minority.  I think the country will implode long before that.  We have a national debt of 5 trillion and unfunded liabilities totalling more than 65 trillion which is more than the total of what the world economy produces.  People who are expecting a social security check or medicare in the golden years are in for a harsh reality</p>

			<p>&#8220;Liberty Enlightening the World&#8221; was a gift from France, but Emma Lazarus, who wrote the poem &#8220;The New Colossus,&#8221; was an American.  It is quite possible, as Ms. Wright implies, that Miss Lazarus had bought the 19th Century myth fostered by big industrialists that this is a &#8220;nation of immigrants&#8221; which welcomes folks from all over the globe, i.e., &#8220;..Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..&#8221;  Clearly, present day liberal loonies have perpetuated this nonsense in the most aggressive and overwhelming fashion, the tools of their trade being to call any opposition &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the education system of the USA promoting, in the minds of our youth for over 40 years, the idea that our Founders and later preservers of all that was good about America were wrong and racist and white supremacist and evil, these lies have been so indelibly embedded in the minds of young people that I daresay that there is no saving the USA if we expect to do so through Internet forums or newscasts or (God help us) newspapers or magazines. While I do agree with the wisdom of additional political parties, that alone won&rsquo;t save us.  We are not going to regain a sensible USA by sitting around a conference table and talking.  <br>

			<p><i>&#8220;I think this article is dead on with one exception.&rdquo; He who desires entrance must merely claim to share certain ideals&rdquo;, but they don&rsquo;t. <br>
Let&rsquo;s get one thing straight, these illegals are here to make money and to take advantage, that&rsquo;s it. They have no interest whatsoever for our laws our heritage or our language.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Illegals?   You are completely missing her point!   She is talking about the Proposition Nation, not about illegals who are here just to make some quick money.</p>
<p>The article is 100% &#8220;dead on&#8221;.<br>

<i>&#8220;The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France and so was the inscription. The inscription seems a strange one, coming from France, since so few French citizens moved to the USA&hellip;.at anytime in our history. A gift from France does not define US policy&hellip;. at the time or later in history.&#8221;</i><br>

<p>Very wrong!  The inscrption was NOT a gift from France!   It had NOTHING to do with France.   It was, in fact, added many years later by those who had an agenda of their own to serve.  They turned the statue into a monument to immigration, which was never the original intent.   And I must add, it certainly has served that agenda exceedingly well if it has fooled one so knowledgeable as Memphomaniac.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Peter Brimelow targets it exactly. He notes that, since the Democrats are made up of a coalition of minorities, they &ldquo;must at all costs prevent America&rsquo;s majority from uniting. Hence, the New York Times&rsquo; hysteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the camp followers of the Times, it is imperative to prevent average white citizens,  still the majority, from ever uniting in the name of any cause. Preventing an effective immigration reform movement is paramount to those who seek to keep this country&rsquo;s borders wide open. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Traveling under the umbrella of &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; or &ldquo;human rights,&rdquo; these &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; groups are represented through a fawning, deferential media as altruistic protectors of society&rsquo;s downtrodden.  <b>Depicting themselves as noble champions of &ldquo;Anti-racism&rdquo; &hellip;. they have acquired enough political power to behave as quasi-government agencies, and some misguided citizens actually believe that these self-appointed entities, and their executive directors, possess official power.&#8221;</b><br>
- - - - - - - - - -<br>
That is as well put as I&rsquo;ve seen it anywhere. It needs to be shouted repeatedly.  In short, the Democrats are not just the pro-minority party,  they are <b>the anti-majority party </b>(even though many of them do not even fully realize it).</p>

<p><br>
It is well put indeed! </p>
<p>As always  (a recognizable trademark of the Left) they phrase their agenda in lofty terms of morality, rights, altruism, and virtue    &mdash;   fine-sounding ideals which no reasonable or decent person could be expected to oppose.   </p>
<p>Leftists always make it a point to seize the moral highground from which they (being more virtuous than everyone else)  can scold and lecture the rest of us, using guilt as a major weapon of control.  They claim to be serving humanity, but on closer inspection, all of their agendas turn out to be curiously self-serving as well.  While they are quite willing to sacrifice the interests of others on the altar  of &#8220;human rights&#8221;,  &#8220;social justice&#8221;, or whatever, they never seem to give up anything their own. How odd. </p>
<p>Just point to ANY case in which they have, in the name of higher social justice, given up a job, promotion, scholarship, contract, or grant in favor of some more deserving &#8220;minority&#8221;. Or even tolerated their own neighborhood or school to be invaded by &#8220;problem populations.&#8221;   It is always somebody ELSE who must be the sacrificial lamb, never them.  All of their schemes and social programs are rigged so as to come out:  Heads you lose, tails they win.      </p>

			<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m _all_ for taking in the poor and the oppressed &#8220;yearning to breathe free.&#8221; But we can&rsquo;t take in _ALL_ of them. We can only integrate so many people into our economy at a time before the wheels come off. We need to cool it. <br>

<p>I agree with you completely. Some people have this fairy tale idea that all you have to do is vote for Chuck Baldwin,Ron Paul Michael Pertrouka and every thing will be all right..WE will then  get a seat at the table. Complete nonesense. The Three of the them are idea -nation abstrationists with no committment to preventing the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. They blather on and on about how everything will be alright if everyone abides by a strict interpretation of the constitution. The racial transformation of America is happening very rapidly. Sure there need to be alternative parties. However, something much more fundamental needs to take place. And it is this:millions of highly vigilent Native Born White America at a grass  roots level-year in and year out. There has to be an end to the spectacle of thousands and thousands of White Men sitting in football stadiums every Saturday and Sunday rooting for young black men in tight spandex. This is really sick and disgusting.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans will either politically organize around their legitimate racial interests or they will reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority withi the borders of America. Even at this late stage of the game, Peter Brimelow and vdare.com has not advocated  this even though it is extremely obvious thing for Native Born White Americans to do. There can be no other response to the raced-based politics of hispanics,blacks hindus,sikhs,koreans and pakistanis. What are you waiting for Peter Brimelow?</p>
