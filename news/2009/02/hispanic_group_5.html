			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Eggerton, Broadcasting &amp; Cable, January 29, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a petition to the FCC this week, the National Hispanic Media Coalition claims that hate speech is &#8220;prevalent&#8221; on national cable news networks and wants the government to do something about it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NHMC, a nonprofit LA based media advocacy group, cited a 2007 Media Matters study that concluded that &#8220;the alleged connection between illegal immigration and crime&#8221; was discussed on 94 episodes of CNN&rsquo;s Lou Dobbs Tonight, 66 times on Fox&rsquo;s Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, and 29 times on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s Headline News show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NHMC defined hate speech as speech whose cumulative effect is to create an atmosphere of hate and prejudice that &#8220;legitimizes&#8221; violence against its targets.</p>
<p>NHMC was looking for a sympathetic ear from an FCC under Democratic hands, citing candidate Barack Obama&rsquo;s fall 2008 speech to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about immigrants &#8220;counting on us to stop the hateful rhetoric filling the airwaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also sent a copy of the petition to the National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration, asking it to update its 1993 report to Congress on the role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes.</p>
<p>The group said it was not asking the FCC to re-impose the fairness doctrine, something some congressional Democrats have suggested they might want to do, but it does want the FCC to collect data, seek public comment, explore what they say is the relationship between hate speech and hate crimes and &#8220;explore options&#8221; for combating it. An aide to then candidate Barack Obama told B&C; at least twice during the campaign that he did not support reintroducing the doctrine.</p>

			<p>What is more HATEFUL&hellip;..daring to report very serious crimes to the public&hellip;.or actually committing those crimes against innocent American citizens? Free speech is not hate speech, but deliberately targeting Anglos for brutal and savage attacks is actually a hate crime.</p>

<p>Either Hispanics really don&rsquo;t understand the concept of free speech or they just don&rsquo;t care. Hate speech (which is subjective) is also free speech, like it or not. In America, you don&rsquo;t get to shut someone up just because you don&rsquo;t like what they are saying. You can get mad, ignore them, criticize them or even try to drown them out, but you do not get to deny them their right to say what they want to say. I actually heard the Hispanic comedian, George Lopez, remark that free speech has its limits! That&rsquo;s exactly what he said! I wonder what his response would be if he were required to submit his routine to a censor before he were allowed to go onstage. I bet his opinion on free speech would change in a heartbeat. <br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;the alleged connection between illegal immigration and crime&hellip;&#8221; was discussed.  How can &#8220;discussion&#8221; be a problem that requires government intervention?  Leaving aside the obvious fact that there is a very strong connection between Mexicans and crime,  there also seems to be a connection between Mexicans and  political repression.   This is clear proof that these people at the NHMC are Mexicans, not Americans, that they have no regard for our country and its political principles and traditions.  They should be stripped of U.S. citizenship and sent back to their true homeland.  </p>

			<p>I doubt this will have the effect they are hoping for. Indeed, it could backfire on them entirely. The facts, ie. crime statistics/prison populations, etc., hardly work in the favor of these chauvanists and their claims of &#8220;hate-speech.&#8221; If I were Dobbs, etc., I would encourage this and let the facts speak for themselves.</p>

			<p>Non-hate speech by groups like Lulac La Raza and Maldef would consist of cable news that endlessly advocates for hispanics and illegal aliens right to have everything they ask for  &mdash;  in the United States of course. Mexico wouldn&#8221;t give them squat which is why they open their big traps here in the U.S.</p>

			<p>Not too long now and freedom of speech will be gone.</p>
<p>Thanks to diversity and multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>But all these foreigners will be free to talk about us white people.</p>
<p>Time for revolution.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Lou Dobbs&rsquo; ongoing criticism of immigration reform and border enforcement, or more specifically the lack of it, has often drawn criticism from immigrants&rsquo; rights groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t immigrants&rsquo; right groups, they are illegal immigrants&rsquo; right groups.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re at the point where it is often the case when claiming that whites are engaged in hate speech is the hate speech and hate act itself.</p>
<p>Whites need to stop running from being white.  It is who and what we are and we have a right to remain white and to be who and what we are.</p>
<p>If I see one more white starting a sentence with: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist but&hellip;.&#8221; I think I&rsquo;ll scream.  Stop apologizing for being white. Geez!</p>

			<p>HATE SPEECH? OR SIMPLY TELLING THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS&hellip; a truth the Mexican immigrant advocates prefer to keep safely out of public knowledge?</p>
<p>Not only do these criminal illegal alients DEMAND THE RIGHT TO SNEAK INTO OUR COUNTRY, NOW THEY DEMAND TO TAKE AWAY OUR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH! OUR RIGHT TO HOLD OUR OWN OPINIONS, BASED ON THE VERY VISIBLE AMOUNT OF CRIME BY MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS!</p>
<p>Write to the FCC, let these government agencies HEAR OUR SIDE of the free speech picture. The advocacy groups are counting on, are hoping we&rsquo;re too lazy too unmotivated to say or do anything. The FCC can be accessed via the Internet. As can all government agencies. PLEASE GET INVOLVED! Get your friends and family members involved! We have to take our country back from the invaders&hellip; at whatever cost it takes!</p>

			<p>Only the perpetrators can&rsquo;t hear the truth; facts remain regardless how the perp&rsquo;s try to spin.  Simple math and simple statistical evidence.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics commit most violent crime, let it stand.</p>

			<p>All you have to do is look at California&rsquo;s sorry mess. LATINO immigrants and their offspring, many born in our country at taxpayer expense&hellip; cause California&rsquo;s crime problem.</p>
<p>Latinos and their offspring are responsible for so many SO-CAL hospitals at the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Latinos and their offspring draining the welfare funds from taxpayers.</p>
<p>The list goes on but you get the idea. You also understand the reason immigration advocacy groups want to stiffle free speech. Want to label anyone opposed to immigration a redneck racist. </p>

<p>I think it will. Manufacturers will start to pull their ads for fear of loosing the growing Hispanic market. It&rsquo;s never the large Hispanic market, it&rsquo;s always the growing Hispanic market. </p>
<p>Then the rest of the media will start beating up on them in order to prove they are not racist. </p>
<p>As the Mega Dittos man has often said, &#8220;You have the right to free speech, but you don&rsquo;t have the right to to a free podium. Freedom is not free and neither is the truth. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Hate speech&#8221; is almost always something of this kind, a recital of brute facts unfavorable to favored races. Mestizo &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; rhetoric, the black power rantings of Jeremiah Wright and his peers, and the like, are never &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling that the Hispanic National Media Coalition cannot point to a single act of &#8220;violence&#8221; to make their case, yet this imaginary violence is more important to them than the real violence committed by illegal mestizos. </p>

			<p>  What a bunch of hypocrites. If Whites were invading every area of Mexico, their tune would change. Just ignore &#8216;em, then deport &#8216;em!  How&rsquo;s that for hate speech! Hehehehe.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;the alleged connection between illegal immigration and crime&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, are we so stupid as to ignore &#8220;a citizen of Mexico&#8221; whenever the Chicago Tribune publishes a typical crime story?</p>

			<p>Discussing immigration &#8216;legitamizes violence&rsquo;? They seem to be Completely confused as to who is committing violence. Confused or just plain callous. With such a backward starting point I wonder how much faith we can put in the rest of their findings?</p>
