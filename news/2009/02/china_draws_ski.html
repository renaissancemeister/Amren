<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/asia/la-fi-china24-2009feb24,0,6835469,full.story">China Draws Skilled Chinese Back Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Pierson and Don Lee, Los Angeles Times, February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m definitely considering moving back,&#8221; said Jia [Xun Jia, a doctoral candidate in theoretical physics at UCLA], 27, who always envisioned himself establishing a career in the U.S. first but is now firing off his resume to contacts in China. &#8220;They need people to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese government is counting on people like Jia  &mdash;  nicknamed &#8220;sea turtles&#8221; because they journeyed across the ocean and then came back  &mdash;  to help retool its economy and find paths to expansion beyond the cheap exports on which the country has relied for so many years.</p>
<p>Late last year, the government launched an aggressive campaign to lure them back and is spending millions to entice accomplished investors, bankers, researchers and engineers to come home.</p>
<p>During a 10-day series of job fairs in December, Chinese banks, universities and government agencies interviewed more than 4,400 people in London, Chicago and New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The economic boom that lighted up China in the last decade had already served as a beacon to many expatriates, drawing thousands home from the U.S. and other places.</p>
<p>A record 50,000 Chinese students who studied abroad returned to China last year, an increase of 6,000 from the year before and more than double the number in 2004, government statistics show.</p>
<p>Though there are no official data, the presence of returning Chinese expatriates and foreign-born ethnic Chinese in China has grown over the years, experts say.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, about 4,000 businesses are said to have been founded by returned students, amounting to more than $500 million in investment, Chinese state media have reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the global recession slowing the economy to levels last seen in 2002, the Chinese government wants even more of those living abroad to come home in the next few years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s unclear how successful the recruiting campaign will ultimately be, financial firms in Shanghai did recently offer jobs to 53 candidates as a result of the fairs, according to Caijing, an influential Chinese business magazine.</p>
<p>State media also reported that Chinese automaker Futian is eyeing laid-off workers in Detroit, hoping to hire about 10 specialists in research and development, production and sales.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But with China&rsquo;s economic boom over the last decade, the idea of moving back became increasingly palatable and, in many cases, attractive to the ambitious.</p>
<p>Multinational corporations opened offices, entrepreneurs broke ground and living standards soared in the metropolitan areas along the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;The younger generation has no hesitation going back,&#8221; said Henry Zhang of the Chinese Finance Assn., which helped organize a recent recruitment fair in New York. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a permanent shift.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shanghai, the primary destination for those returning, is looking to seize opportunities created by the global downturn to build an international financial center rivaling those of Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Recruiting events now occur regularly. In a low-key affair at the end of December, a group of sea turtles invited 65 people from overseas to spend two days at a Marriott hotel in the Pudong district, China&rsquo;s financial hub and home to Shanghai&rsquo;s stock exchanges.</p>

			<p>China is being hurt badly by the present global drop, and have millions who have lost jobs.</p>
<p>I doubt they will have any jobs for their best and brightest in about a year or so, as they will continue with their job decline.</p>
<p>If China registers an economic contraction, that will be our signal to go straight to our bunkers, because the world global situation will have deteriorated to neanderthal conditions.  Even during our contraction they are expected to grow about 2-3%, and that will still mean tens of millions of unemployed for them.  </p>
<p>Imagine having a nation of 1.3 billion people and just 10% are out of work.  The government could never prevent mass upheaval from such a horde of angry people, so if their economy grows just 1% or contracts, they&rsquo;re finished.  It&rsquo;s all over for them.</p>
<p>Their best and brightest will be scrounging for food and bare survival just like everybody else.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard all kinds of dire warnings for the US, but China and Japan are in pretty bad shape as well.</p>

			<p>Good!  And once they leave, just watch&hellip;..white America will do just fine without them.  The only way we won&rsquo;t do just fine, is if we continue to let in Third World immigrants from the rest of the world (Southeast Asia, India, Middle East, Africa and Latin America).</p>

			<p>Well, since &#8220;diversity&#8221; is such a benefit I am sure the Chinese government will think about allowing in massive amounts of unemployed Americans now.</p>

			<p>This is not a good development.  Anybody working in advanced bio-tech, the medical sciences, or advanced engineering projects can&rsquo;t help but notice the large number of East Asians and Indians working in these fields.  They&rsquo;re a huge net asset to any country which can attract them. </p>
<p>America used to be the science and engineering capital of the world, an in some respects still is.  But when students taking social &#8220;science,&#8221; political &#8220;science,&#8221; African studies, ed majors, drama and other soft and useless college majors hugely outnumber those enrolled in engineering and the hard sciences, we&rsquo;re in deep trouble.  And given our pitiful public educational system this is not a situation that can be reversed quickly, as it was in the Fifties when we got our wake-up call in the form of the first Sputnik.</p>

			<p>Native Born White American tax payers have been forced by both REPUBLICAN and Democratic parties to subsidize China&rsquo;s youth for careers in medicine,science,engineering and technology within the borders of the United States. China is America&rsquo;s miltary and technological competitor. Both Republican and Demcratic parties are guilty of treason!!!! This is what Jared Taylor should say next time he debates post-1965 immigratin policy on national TV.</p>
<p>And as Native Born White Americans are being forced to develope China&rsquo;s youth within the borders of America, there has been a corresponding underdevelopment of Native Born White American youth for careers in medicine,science,engineering and computer programming.</p>
<p>All of this could have been avoided if the Chinese Exclusion Act had not been repealed. The Chinese Exclusion was a wonderfull thing. It protected the legitimate racial interests of Native Born White Americans. The case against asian LEGAL asian  IMMIGRATION is quite strong.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of what I call Wall Street Journal Republicans-White people who are fine with immigration so long as it is from Asia-&#8220;they contribute to our(whomever &#8220;we&#8221; is nowadays) economy.&#8221; Ironically, at same time these people give me the darkest looks for supporting eugenics as wonderful measure for staying competitive. </p>
<p>The fact that these jobs are no longer in the hands of White people whose roots to this nation go back for generations makes &#8220;us&#8221; vulnerable. &#8220;We&#8221; are now dependent on the whims of foreigners as this article clearly illustrates. If you&rsquo;ve ever had a decent conversation with highly educated Chinese or Indians it would become obvious that most are indifferent or disdainful towards the bulk of America.</p>
<p>Not acknowledging race IQ differences could be just as awful as turning a blind eye instinctive tribal interests.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is. With a population of 3.5 million, Chinese-Americans are 1% of the US population. Their influence in the country is relatively limited&hellip; It&rsquo;s like people seem to forget that the combined numbers of blacks and hispanics is 28% of this country, and who are far more destructive in comparison. Could someone enlighten me as to why the Chinese are allocated such a disproportionate amount of concern compared to the rest?</p>
<p>Jupiter, China is not an enemy. It is true that they have great ambitions, but not once have they expressed interest in our physical demise - as you seem to be implying. The Chinese certainly do not see this as a race war, they are fully aware that America is a multicultural country. The only real flash point where there might be war is over Taiwan, but the island is entirely Chinese anyways and should be none of our concern. </p>

Vulnerable to what? America is the most powerful country in the world. If skilled Asians leave, then there should be Whites who could fill the jobs.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I&#8221; (6:45 pm Feb 26th) is correct. One of the main problems behind this is that the schools (never mind the government and media) have been for decades, sometimes directly, sometimes in roundabout fashion, working overtime to make sure whites do not do well, are not encouraged, while non-whites are encouraged and rewarded. The assault is aided by US schools receiving extra money from the US government for having non-white students, and what better way to do that than let in unqualified blacks and hispanics, and balance it with qualified foreigners who, being non-white, allow more money to be poured into school coffers from the US govt, because the foreign students aren&rsquo;t white. Add to this the fact that white American culture has been poisoned and ridiculed, made to go as low as possible in its attitudes toward scholarship and education and here we are. Most white kids are more worried about entertainment and being popular, cutting edge than in how to read or handle calculus 101. I assure the foreign students are more worried about school first, the way a good chunk of the white population used to be. </p>
<p>It is true that working in certain fields ( I work in a high tech field ) you can&rsquo;t help but notice how many E. Asians and Indians there are. You also can&rsquo;t help but notice how few of them truly lack creativity and are unable to think outside the box (they sure are willing to try and swipe your ideas, that&rsquo;s for sure). There must be different types of intelligence that cannot be quantified yet. </p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t need them before, we don&rsquo;t need them now. They don&rsquo;t only come to the US for the education. They KNOW they will receive favored treatment over native-born whites, go ahead and ask them. They don&rsquo;t care either.  I should also add that this story is more fluff than substance, the WSJ, NYT and LAT among others are always trying to put some kind of spin like this on legal and illegal immigration. The fact is most who come here stay here. People would be stunned to see how money is doled for research these days. Certain connected individuals and non-whites are favored far above white males, who now on the bottom rung when it comes to grant consideration and such.</p>
<p>All whites need to do is wrest their government, media and schools back from the cultural Marxists and things could be back on track rather quickly. </p>

			<p>The horrible fact is that Chinese and Indian talent is being imported into the U.S. to do the work that Liberals do not want White men to do. Liberals know that the U.S. needs massive amounts of intellectual talent for science, engineering, medicine, etc.; women and Blacks cannot supply this need, even if they tried. So rather than educate White men so they could supply this need, as White men have always done, the Liberals use oriental geniuses. </p>
<p>This benefits Liberals in two ways:<br>
It allows Liberals to use schools for Liberal indoctrination rather than education. <br>
It also damages White men economically.</p>

			<p>The sooner we get rid of the techno-foreigners, the better.  True, we will lose some talent and some business, but that talent has always had their loyalties elsewhere.  In 15 years, maybe less, it would be possible to replace them all with American Whites.  A reborn society that has the strength to expel the invaders can also reform our schools, without a question.  It is no mystery why our schools are so bad, it is a matter of deliberate policy, and no trick to bring them back, given the will.   If we can sweep away the multi-cultural state, there would be no one left to keep our schools in the gutter.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great response. This is exactly what Jared Taylor should say in his next public debate.</p>
<p>Asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS are actively involved in the deskilling of the Native Born White America popualtion and the destruction of thousands of years of collective Native Born White American engineering experience. This should be stated over and over again over at vdare.com Instead we get posts from Steve Sailer about whether or no mulitmillioniare black NBA centers have higher IQs than multmillionaire black NBA guards. This is insane.</p>
<p>The immigration &#8220;debate&#8221; would really be blown open wide if comments like mine-you don&rsquo;t have to quote me Peter Brimelow- were repeated over and over again on vdare.com. The asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; would go ballistic. And if they did, this would be a very good thing.</p>

			<p>As this conversation develops, let&rsquo;s please not intertwine Indians with Chinese people.  </p>
<p>Chinese people, have, on average, IQs that are quite high.  Indians do not.  Compare India to the countries like China, Korea and Japan, and you see starking differences in level of advancement.</p>
<p>Where in American history we decided that Indians of all people would make good engineers is beyond me.  I have extensively read Lynn and Rushton&rsquo;s work on this stuff.  Even the educated Indians who move here have lower IQs than most of the native whites who are here.  This is well documented.</p>
<p>In any case, neither of these groups belong here.  This is one thing they have in common.</p>

			<p>&#8220;China is not an enemy.&#8221;  Aegis.  Maybe not, but they&rsquo;re not our friends either.  China is interested in the well-being of China, which is why they send smart people here to establish colonies.  They don&rsquo;t want our farmland, which is why they don&rsquo;t send tens of millions of coolies.  They want our technology, which can be had by establishing a small population of techno-savvy &#8220;Asian Americans&#8221;.  The fact that they are only 1% of the population is misleading.  What percent of the engineers, computer programmers, chemists, physicists, and other scientific researchers are they?  And whatever that number of Chinese scientists and technologists is, how much of our research passes through their hands at one time or another, to possibly be passed on to the Homeland?  One spy can steal the work of many Americans.  <br>
     Let&rsquo;s change the setting.  Imagine if, during the Cold War, five percent of Soviet scientists were in fact, loyal Americans.  These people would be spread throughout the scientific establishment of the USSR.  Given that scientists work in groups, sharing data, asking opinions, how much of Soviet science would have escaped the notice of the CIA?  Do you imagine that the Chinese government allows intelligent people to come here in order to strengthen America?  Is this some kind of foreign aid?  <br>
     I don&rsquo;t fault China for any of this.  The Chinese government would be as irresponsible as our own if they did not take advantage of the situation.  I wish our rulers were as patriotic as China&rsquo;s.  </p>

<p>A lot of the &#8220;investment analysts&#8221; on Wall St. would disagree with you, but your thesis is fundamentally correct.  I don&rsquo;t waste my time reading the spiels of the Sinophiles who write for the Wall St. Journal, who are always exhorting Americans to &#8220;buy China.&#8221;  Instead, I peruse the Net reading articles by foreign policy experts who paint a completely different picture of the &#8220;Yellow Dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>China is basically a country of 1.3 billion people: 260 million &#8220;haves&#8221; and 1.04 billion &#8220;have nots.&#8221;  </p>
<p>https://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KA16Ad04.html</p>
<p>Every year China suffers tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrations, most of which never make it into the Western press.  These demonstrations range from a few angry peasants waving placards, to thousands of people burning down a hospital.  The latter occurred because a rural hospital let a young boy from a peasant family die due to the fact his family couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay them.</p>
<p>Ironically, China&rsquo;s increasing prosperity is also causing a growing disparity between classes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gwu.edu/~econ270/Taejoon.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.gwu.edu/~econ270/Taejoon.html</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget there is also a huge surplus male population in the country.</p>
<p>https://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=5715</p>
<p>All this points to the fact China has the very real potential of becoming a very unstable place in the near future if current economic conditions continue to deteriorate.  If that happens, expect to see a yellow army of refugees washing up on our shores that dwarfs anything you see now.</p>

			<p>Schoolteacher,  </p>
<p>Picture this scenario - You are born in China. Your parents are two White American diplomats who live there. You grow up in China, all of your friends are Chinese, you love the country and are a genuine Chinese patriot. Later in life, you become an engineer and work for China Aerospace Corporation (CASC). What if everything you did went under intense scrutiny?, for the rest of your career, for the rest of your life?&hellip;even though you were born in China but simply didn&rsquo;t look like your peers, plus your parents are American and hence the greatest threat to Chinese eminence. Is it fair to you? Of course not. No one should have to be subject to that.</p>
<p>My point is, by assuming that the Chinese here in America are spies&hellip;by assuming that they are inherently disloyal, we run the risk of wrongfully hampering the lives of those who are innocent. What about the increasing numbers of Chinese who are born in the USA?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that Chinese government sends over people. But there are also ordinary Chinese who come here (whom China is now trying to lure back). I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s one huge coordinated effort of espionage. It is highly unlikely. I understand your concern Schoolteacher, but I think there&rsquo;s gray area which is equally important as the issue at hand.     </p>

<p>The Chinese &#8220;American&#8221; population in OUR America is as you wrote growing. They are a fifth column from China. They are actively participating in the racial dispossession of the majority Native Born White Amerian population. This is indisputable. When they vote at election time,they vote to increase thier numbers and decrease Native Born white American numbers. WE are competing with them for the scarce resources of America. They do not belong here. No liberal -evenhandedness</p>

<p>Hi Courtney. It&rsquo;s a typo. Believe me, the Asians seem to have a true lack of creativity, at least in comparison with whites. This can&rsquo;t be measured by tests but you can see in work. Some of them have been good workers, but for all their education, they&rsquo;re more suited to the &#8220;grunt work&#8221; if that makes sense. Very few of them were gifted with even &#8216;standard&rsquo; levels of creativity.</p>
