			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Snyder, The Hill, February 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Backers of sweeping immigration policy changes, bolstered by the growing importance of the Hispanic voting bloc, are urging lawmakers to tackle the touchy subject this year despite rising unemployment levels among legal residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Joe Baca (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told The Hill that he plans to speak on the House floor every week on the need for Congress to act.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But supporters acknowledge that rising joblessness creates a public-relations problem, if nothing else: How do you provide millions of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship at a time when millions of legal residents are out of work?</p>
<p>Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), one of the chief critics of so-called comprehensive reform efforts, has said it was &#8220;particularly infuriating&#8221; to know that there are an estimated 7 million illegal workers in the United States when unemployment is rising.</p>
<p>Opposition to a broad reform package could come from the left, too. Labor groups don&rsquo;t like efforts to increase guest- and temporary-worker programs, which they believe undercut employment and wages for permanent workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But if the economy is a drag on the cause, supporters say, there are a number of factors that play in their favor.</p>
<p>Democrats, who tend to be more supportive of the reform efforts, now hold stronger majorities in Congress. And there is further evidence that Republican opposition to immigration reform has undercut the party&rsquo;s support among Hispanics, the fastest-growing voting bloc in the electorate.</p>
<p>Sharry said the recent elections show the politics of the debate have shifted. Once considered a third rail for Democrats  &mdash;  a wedge issue akin to gay marriage  &mdash;  immigration reform now has broad support among voters.</p>
<p>Sharry said voters in swing districts favor the comprehensive immigration reform over an enforcement-only approach by a 2-to-1 margin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stewart Verdery, a former Homeland Security official who as a lobbyist supported a comprehensive reform bill, said the effort is also helped by improvements in border security made since the last big push at reform died on the Senate floor two years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s left is how to deal with the illegal immigrants already here and find the right mix of temporary workers to satisfy businesses without being a deal-killer for labor.</p>
<p>The issue is about creating &#8220;fairness among employees,&#8221; Sharry said, by giving undocumented workers greater protection from being exploited, which drives down wages across the board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The economy provides an obstacle in another sense as well. Addressing this leaves little room for lawmakers to tackle other issues. Congress already has a full plate of controversial matters: a follow-on bailout for the financial-services sector; a package of financial-sector regulatory reforms; and a controversial effort to make it easier for workers to organize.</p>
<p>Given the time and the state of the economy, some supporters say they want to begin the discussion this year with an eye toward passing a bill in 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans talk more about the rising unemployment levels. Amador said he stresses how the market should determine immigration levels, and also makes a blatant political appeal: &#8220;They cannot continue with their stand and retain their seats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verdery, a Republican, said the party is torn. At the national level, party leaders know they can&rsquo;t continue to antagonize Hispanic voters and centrists who support a broad reform bill and expect to win back their congressional majorities. But the party members in Congress now tend to come from conservative districts that oppose offering illegal immigrants some kind of pass, which leaves them little incentive to compromise.</p>
<p>Opponents of reform have also proven incredibly adept at mobilizing thousands of their supporters to fight any proposal that can be tagged with offering &#8220;amnesty&#8221; to illegal immigrants. That&rsquo;s also one reason why some Democrats are as reluctant as Republicans to tackle the issue.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/18905.html">Rahm&rsquo;s Immigration Turnabout</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Gebe Martinez, Politico, February 17, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>It was not so long ago that Rahm Emanuel was on the House Democratic leadership team and being accused of throwing immigrants &#8220;under the bus&#8221; for the sake of strengthening Democrats&rsquo; power in the House.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now, as President Barack Obama&rsquo;s chief of staff, Emanuel is removing roadblocks that stand in the way of some of the legislative agenda benefitting immigrants, ethnic minorities and their advocates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For example, he recently cleared the path for increased benefits for legal immigrant children and pregnant women in the State Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program, Obama&rsquo;s first major legislative victory.</p>
<p>The debate was set up by Latino leaders and immigrants&rsquo; rights backers as a test of Obama&rsquo;s and Congress&rsquo; commitment to their issues. In negotiations with key senators, Emanuel warned that the bill would not be signed without the immigration benefits.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s gatekeeper also kicked up a lot of dust by promising black and Hispanic lawmakers that the White House would closely monitor the director of the Census Bureau on the 2010 count  &mdash;  legally under the purview of the Commerce Department  &mdash;  since the census will determine future political representation and the distribution of federal dollars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On both issues, Emanuel showed an appreciation for the high Hispanic voter turnout and support for Democrats in 2008 that dramatically shifted the political landscape. The election also proved that all voters want the immigration system repaired, instead of demagogued.</p>
<p>SCHIP &#8220;would not have happened without Rahm,&#8221; said Janet Murguia, president of National Council of La Raza. &#8220;SCHIP demonstrated that not only could they take that stand, but they could take that stand and win.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In most races since 2006 in which Republicans tried to use immigration as a wedge issue, Democrats won, Sharry said. He points to Idaho freshman Democrat Walt Minnick, who defeated Republican incumbent Bill Sali in 2008 by favoring a tough enforcement and legalization program over Sali&rsquo;s deportation strategy. The Idaho district is 7 percent Latino, and Minnick won just over 50 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a recent interview with a dozen Hispanic journalists in the Old Executive Office Building, Emanuel said the administration purposely pushed a more complicated SCHIP proposal that relaxed rules by extending benefits to immigrants who have been in the country for less than five years.</p>
<p>SCHIP shows that &#8220;the arrow is pointing in a different direction in relation to immigration politics in this country,&#8221; Emanuel told the Hispanic media during the second week of the new administration. SCHIP can be viewed as a down payment on what will be forthcoming from the Obama administration, Emanuel added, according to La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though forceful on some issues, Emanuel remains evasive about whether Obama will keep his campaign promise to produce a comprehensive immigration plan this year.</p>
<p>While major players agree the economic crisis is the first priority, Democratic lawmakers such as Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, from Emanuel&rsquo;s home state of Illinois, have not let up the pressure on Emanuel to act this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates await the administration&rsquo;s review of immigration raids that were stepped up by former President George W. Bush and that terrorized immigrants and even Hispanics who are U.S. citizens. But Emanuel remains &#8220;very mindful&#8221; of Obama&rsquo;s campaign pledge to &#8220;rise above the fear and demagoguery,&#8221; Murguia said.</p>

			<p>How do they know that people &#8220;prefer comprehensive immigration reform to&#8221; other proposals by a 2-to-1 margin?   Because pollsters are making people think that &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; includes a 100,000 volt fence, a triple border wall, AND the 101st Airborne, comprehensively.  In other words, they don&rsquo;t say that it means soft amnesty.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hispanic pressure groups don&rsquo;t want amnesty derailed by bad economy&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course this is more accurate than the main title of the article:&#8221;Immigration Reform Advocates Push Forward In Tough Economy&#8221;</p>
<p>But back to Am Rens more accurate subheading &#8220;&#8221;Hispanic&#8221;(my quotes) pressure groups don&rsquo;t want amnesty derailed by bad economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>This sounds kind of &#8220;racist&#8221; to me, since it focuses on one group only. Not only is this group of people here illegally, but to the detriment of U.S. citizens. Yet, when I looked up out of curiosity how American Renaissance Magazine was charcterized by WikiPedia, it stated that it was a &#8220;racist&#8221; magazine, presumably because it is focused on the interests of European Americans  &mdash;  only. The hypocricy of leftists in this nation should shame them, but they have no shame.</p>

			<p>Native Born White Americans are completely defenseless-psychologically speaking-against a raced-based political movement of hispanics,asians,blacks ands muslims.</p>
<p>Either Native Born White Americans politically organize around their legitmate racial interests or Native Born White Americans will face complete racial dispossession at the hands of post-1965 non-whites. It is no more complicated than this. At this late stage of the game Peter Brimelow will not advocate this self-defense strategy for Native Born White Americans. This ought to be the centerpiece of vdare.com.  White Nationalisn is the only game in town.</p>
<p>The proper response to Delores Rida-Peter Brimelow-is not liberal even-handedness,but rather, an in-your-face defense of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>And what is Roy Beck&rsquo;s and numbersusa.com&rsquo;s response to the belligerence of Hispanic racialism? Immigration must be shut down because&hellip;&hellip; it is bad for hispanics and blacks. Beck wrote this today in his most recent numbersusa.com blog. Not one word about how White Americans are harmed by post-1965 non-white immigration. When you accept millions of dollars from a liberal multimillionaire hedge fund owner, you are not allowed to mention the fact that Native Born White Americans are harmed by post-1965 non-white immigrants. Numbersusa.com is a disgusting organization. Give your $$$$$ to American Renassaince. It is one minute before midnight for White America. </p>

			<p>Well, well, well&hellip;the usual prevarications and outright lies!</p>
<p>&#8220;Backers of sweeping immigration policy changes, bolstered by the growing importance of the Hispanic voting bloc, are urging lawmakers to tackle the touchy subject this year despite rising unemployment levels among legal residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the outright lies:</p>
<p>1.) The &#8220;growing importance&#8221; of the &#8220;Hispanic voting bloc&#8221; is about as much of concern to any semi-sane or decently patriotic political leader (I know, few and far between these days) as is the Klingon voting bloc. Hispanics, Asians, blacks, and all the others &#8220;of color,&#8221; only make up 35% of the population; and they probably are only about 19% to 21% of the actual total potential registered voters in any given national election. Catering to these aliens and interlopers, is not of any reasoned or foresightful considerations, except to utter fools and abjectly worthless traitors.</p>
<p>Enough said!</p>
<p>2.) The subject of repulsing or even eradicating (without compunction or mercy) this illegal alien invasion, is not a &#8220;touchy subject,&#8221; in any normal person&rsquo;s mind. It is a simple question of what needs doing and with what tools; here, it is clear, every military means must be considered, right down to even executing the nuclear option. </p>
<p>End of story!</p>
<p>The prevarications:</p>
<p>1A.) &#8220;Sweeping immigration policy changes,&#8221; is simply a euphemism for amnesty.</p>
<p>2B.)&#8221;Rising unemployment levels among legal residents,&#8221; is another hideously perverse bit of word tossing, used to describe an economy in free fall and a people overburdened with their &#8220;leaders&rsquo;&#8221; grandiloquently absurd desires for them to be &#8220;transformed&#8221; out of all recognition as Americans. </p>
<p>Need I say more, need I go on?</p>
<p>I think not, except to say, God help us all!</p>

			<p>There is no political solution.  These people are simply arguing over the carcass of the former USA.  These traitors have been been ignoring their oaths to uphold the laws of the United States for thirty years or more.  They have, one way or another, failed to protect our borders, the most elementary of any government&rsquo;s duties.  They have not even tried.  There is no excuse, there can be no understanding.  Our best option is economic collapse.  In times of anarchy, those who act purposefully have the high cards.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Opposition to a broad reform package could come from the left, too. Labor groups don&rsquo;t like efforts to increase guest- and temporary-worker programs, which they believe undercut employment and wages for permanent workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the lighter side of things, I did burst into laughter when I read that tidbit of &#8220;insight&#8221; on the part of the &#8220;author,&#8221; Comrade Snyder. Does he even know what his rosy political &#8220;tribe&#8221; believes in? Does he not know, that we all live in the General Secretary BO&rsquo;s age of &#8220;miracles and wonders?&#8221;</p>
<p>Please, and please again; these Reds are abysmally wretched idiots, who think that because the corroding plague of Communistic multiculturalism has warped their minds into a kaleidoscopic fantasyland, that it can also become a workable daily reality. </p>
<p>Sort of like a lottery, where all win no matter what and also get endless millions of shiny rainbow prizes as well. Even if some, or better still all, didn&rsquo;t even bother to buy tickets for the drawing.</p>
<p>Good luck there comrades, good luck indeed!</p>

			<p>Do the amnesty advocates realize that when the blanket proclamation is given to those who have no use for our laws, that the US will be open to anyone from anywhere? The late comers will then take the jobs of the border jumpers working now, because they will take even lower wages. It&rsquo;s a vicious, never-ending circle. Do we truly want a nation of low-skilled, poorly educated criminals who will never assimilate? No other group in our nation&rsquo;s history have pushed their demands, lawlessnes, language and sheer numbers on us and had this once-proud country bow to their wishes. Our government has failed us miserably on enforcing our immigration laws.</p>

			<p>Joe Baca, huh? It&rsquo;s just one hispanic trying to help other hispanics. When was the last time you heard of whites helping other whites? This problem was totally unavoidable. If concerned Americans marched to their town halls in the beginning and demanded action there would be no illegal aliens and we would still have a country worth saving.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s insanity, of course, especially in light of the water being turned off on many farms in California as a result of the drought. 40,000 less farm jobs by the end of this year yet still they come, have as many children as possible, and go on welfare.</p>
