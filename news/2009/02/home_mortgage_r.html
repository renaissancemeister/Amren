<h1><a href="https://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=89967">Home Mortgage Relief for Millions of <em>Illegals</em></a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerome R. Corsi, WorldNetDaily, February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal aliens can apply for mortgage relief under the Obama administration&rsquo;s $275 billion plan, according to immigration experts and a group the government will use to help homeowners modify loans.</p>
<p>Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., told WND approximately 1 million households headed by illegal immigrants acquired mortgages through the beginning of 2007, before the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chad Buchanan, a manager at SaveMyHomeUSA  &mdash;  a group cooperating with the Obama administration that assists homeowners facing foreclosure  &mdash;  told WND illegal immigrants who own a home &#8220;could certainly apply under our program.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SaveMyHomeUSA is seeking job applications for loan modification processors to work in the Obama administration mortgage modification program.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of mortgage modifiers out there never ask about the legal immigration status of the homeowner, and we do not ask either,&#8221; Buchanan said. &#8220;This is the first time I&rsquo;ve had that question asked. All we are looking to do is to modify the current note, regardless what the legal immigration status of the client is.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mass marketed e-mail from Nicole Mercier at SaveMyHomeUSA tells prospects for the loan modification processor positions that the government &#8220;has provided billions of dollars to help people save their homes from foreclosure.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ALIPAC&rsquo;s president, William Gheen, told WND the e-mail from SaveMyHomeUSA &#8220;not only looks like illegal immigrants could refinance their own homes under the Obama mortgage modification program, they could also apply to become loan modification brokers, so they could help other illegal immigrants refinance their mortgages.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Whew,assistance with home mortgages. If Americans in the past AND present could only have had this priviledge. Again, we allow this so we deserve it. Millions of American taxpayers should have been protesting on the streets of D.C. a long time ago, but especially now. They won&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>Remember, obama PROMISED to REDISTRIBUTE THE WEALTH!   well, this is just part of it, and probably the tip of the iceberg I am afraid.  </p>
<p>This is just a continuation of our government going about their usual convoluted ways to bring about the north american union. bush promised it by 2010.  </p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Under Obama plan, illegals will get taxpayer money for &ldquo;mortgage assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So THAT&rsquo;s the real definition of &#8220;obscene.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a White American takes a chance of buying a pricier suburban home to escape urban crime&hellip; can&rsquo;t meet the payments due to job loss&hellip; tough beans, right? A damned illegal? No problemo, amigo! The (Democratic) government is only too happy to help. Just one string, Senor, Senorita. You must promise to vote the straight Democratic ticket next election. You say you can&rsquo;t vote, you&rsquo;re an illegal? Do not worry, friends. The registraars and poll watchers have been carefully trained and instructed not to notice you can&rsquo;t even speak English.</p>

			<p>The stimulus package is a way for taxpayer money to be thrown around and will have no effect on our long term financial problems and the Obama administration knew this from the start. President  has and never had any intention of doing the things it will take to begin setting us on the path to progressively getting us out of this mess.  It should involve massive cuts in government spending. I&rsquo;m sure president big ears  and his all star administrations solution will be to progressively tax and continue to run up debt.  I&rsquo;ll bet if you asked the average dumb American &#8220;what is &#8220;President Obama doing about our current  economic crisis?&#8221;  They would say the stimulus package.  How many trillions of dollars are we in debt and their stimulus package is going to somehow have any effect at all.  I wonder if this nation isn&rsquo;t literally been bankrupted on purpose.  I wonder if our planners in government and in finance at high levels haven&rsquo;t just engineered this mess to put a dumbed down and ignorant mass of stupid Americans in serious debt, devalue their currency and bankrupt their futures.  Hey Obama feels good though and he says we need to unify.  If it comes between serious problems and warm and fuzzy I have to go with warm and fuzzy.</p>

			<p>I am going to use this space to again point out a grim fact;  IF we allow nine million people to be pushed onto the streets, civil mayhem will be an unlikely outcome.  Some may welcome that, but since money always seems to be what many Whites care most about - the idea that they might have to pay taxes - consider how much it would cost to deal with nine million homeless.  I did just a little preliminary figuring and the cost would be triple the mortgage bailout.  Why don&rsquo;t  more of us Whites complain about all the money spent on &#8220;liberating&#8221; non-White countries like Iraq and all the billions spent on aid to Africa?</p>
<p>I wish to also report to you that even I, after a life of doing everything right, geting an education at  my  own expense, paying my student loans off, working hard, saving, investing, etc., I had an abrupt retirement when I had my private office burglarized and ransacked by gangs in California.  Then, I had a job at a clinic that served a 90% Hispanic patient load.  I discoverd blantant and multiple insurance bilking and even a scheme where illegals were guided into the community, told to get jobs, get injured and the clinic would argue for them - as long as they showed up for therapy - and fix it so they would get disability checks for life.  When I discovered all this (I predicted an eventual investigation and was right) I QUIT!  I left California and have struggled financially ever since.  Now my holdings have lost so much value that I am in danger of losing my home.  It turns out that I will likely qualify for a re-figuring of my mortgage so that my income will allow us to remain in our home and survive without having to join the projected nine-million in the streets.</p>
<p>My view as a result is that after so much federal and state policy has worked to ruin me, perhaps I will finally benefit a little after having always done the right thing - by a government that perhaps thinks it is serving minorities most.  But I know sereral other descent White families that need help too.</p>
<p>So do not be so eager to condemn.  Many conservatives have been very happy to bilk the government and take advantage of ridiculous real estate inflation.  Most real estate agenst I have ever known were conservatives as the mortgage lenders were as well.  Think before you act or react.  Unless you love the idea of mayhem and a huge increase of lawlessness, including conditions that would likely cost you your comfort, try to be more realistic about this subject. </p>

<p>I think you were trying to say it will be a <i>likely</i> outcome.  To which I say &#8220;so what?&#8221;  Nine million grubby illegals swarming the streets and making Diversity-eyed Whites afraid and uncomfortable might be exactly what this country needs to finally sound the wakeup call.  </p>
<p>Your &#8220;solution&#8221; of handing the swelling mestizo masses enough bribes to keep them from showing their true colors is not only the cowardly route of the latter-day Roman Empire, it&rsquo;s an endless black hole that will absorb an infinite volume of money while only delaying the inevitable day of reckoning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if you think that the anti-socialist elements here are against you.  Most of the vitriol against this bill is directed toward the &#8220;affirmative-action&#8221; mentality that led to irresponsible lending to unqualified borrowers.  I don&rsquo;t think that most AmRen posters would begrudge you aid in this time of hardship.</p>
<p>The anger is against illegals who came to this country homeless, took advantage of our misguided &#8220;generosity&#8221; and are now being rewarded for exploiting it.  I think you&rsquo;d agree that the more of this money that is directed at illegals, the less there will be for unfortunate Americans like yourself.</p>
<p>In regards to your first point, I would agree that nine million homeless would indeed be dangerous to society.  There are certainly some homeowners who have legitimate needs and even the others, you could argue, should be subsidized to keep them from causing even worse harm to society.</p>
<p>However, every penny of government aid given to illegals just encourages them to continue the invasion.  There are many AmRen posters who would disagree with me on this, but I&rsquo;d be willing to accept the current illegal population into our country if it meant that we could end illegal immigration.  This compromise would mean that for every dollar spent to keep current illegals off the streets, at least one dollar would be spent on deportation, &#8220;infrastructure projects&#8221; and manpower to police our borders.  Unfortunately I see nothing of the kind in this bill or the current &#8220;stimulus&#8221;.</p>
<p>We live in a far from perfect world, so sometimes we must accept far from perfect solutions to our problems.  However, subsidizing potential criminals to prevent lawlessness amounts to large-scale extortion - economic terrorism.  We can&rsquo;t accept legislation that postpones a problem without proposing to eventually fix it.</p>

			<p>There is only one solution.</p>
<p>Dissolve the federal government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to start really ramping up the pressure to call a constitutional convention.  It came damn close the last time and that was before Obama crashed our economy.</p>
<p>Dissolve the presidency, congress, the courts, the whole thing.</p>
<p>State soveriegnty is the ONLY soveriegnty.  30 states agree with this and counting:</p>

			<p>The main problem with a Constitutional Convention is that we don&rsquo;t really know what would come out of it.  </p>
<p>As for &#8220;redistributing the wealth&#8221;, that has happened already.  My 401(k) lost 1/3 of its value last year.</p>
