<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seven black firefighters are suing the city, contending that the Houston Fire Department&rsquo;s test for officer promotions adversely affects blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is systemic discrimination,&#8221; said the firefighters&rsquo; attorney, Dennis Thompson. &#8220;Selection rates for African-Americans are abysmally smaller than for white candidates.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Firefighters trying to attain the rank of captain and above in the Houston Fire Department must take a 100-question multiple-choice test. Numerous studies show that blacks as a group do less well on high-stakes tests, Thompson said. He said fire departments should use cognitive tests only as a pass-fail benchmark and also should focus on performance exercises and other criteria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t do as well on these multiple-choice tests,&#8221; said Capt. Otis Jordan, president of the Houston Black Firefighters Association. Jordan and the HBFA are not part of the suit. &#8220;I compare fighting a fire, riding an apparatus, to playing football. Your best athlete might not be the straight-A student.&#8221;</p>
<p>HFD has about 4,200 firefighters and paramedics. Roughly 700 are black, Jordan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kevin Michael Foster, an education anthropologist at the University of Texas at Austin&rsquo;s College of Education, agreed that research has demonstrated a test score gap between blacks and whites. There are several theories about why, but a primary explanation has to do with minority students disproportionately receiving inferior educations compared to whites, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During standardized tests, minorities are also vulnerable to performance anxieties that stem from cultural stereotypes, Foster said. {snip}</p>
<p><b>System adjusted in 2005</b></p>
<p>While officer promotions once heavily emphasized the written test, HFD&rsquo;s system was adjusted in 2005 as part of a collective bargaining agreement, said Jeffrey Caynon, president of the Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association Local 341. There has been only one testing cycle since the change, he added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks promotions to captain or senior captain for the plaintiffs, back pay and damages.<br>

			<p>It was a discriminatory test, in that it was a test with standards.  Anything that has a hard standard is going to have a disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics, because of IQ differences.  If minorities are prone to &#8220;performance anxiety&#8221; on a test, what would it be like actually fighting a fire?</p>

			<p>The fireman&rsquo;s test is &#8220;systemic discrimination&#8221; against blacks just as the NBA is &#8220;systemic discrimination&#8221; against short people.</p>
<p>This nonsense just proves that an equal, racially blind playing field is the very last thing blacks want.</p>

<p>Yes, there are a great many theories, but let&rsquo;s under no circumstances ever talk about the most reasonable theory, and in fact one cause that has been demonstrated time and time again, over the last 50 years and in nearly every country   &mdash;   low IQ.  </p>
<p>A society that lives by lies and obfuscations can not long survive. </p>

<p>When cowed white officials make these tests easier or just drop them, and the Houston Fire Department is criticised years later for being highly inept, the aforementioned black firefighters will whine that this criticism is <i>racist</i> too.</p>
<p><i>Firefighters trying to attain the rank of captain and above in the Houston Fire Department must take a 100-question multiple-choice test.</i></p>
<p><i>Multiple choice</i> questions?</p>
<p><i> &ldquo;I compare fighting a fire, riding an apparatus, to playing football. Your best athlete might not be the straight-A student.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>As the ranks of Captain and higher must require other forms of ability outside merely &#8220;fighting fires&#8221;, practical performance alone shouldn&rsquo;t dictate whether someone is &#8220;promotion-worthy&#8221; or not:<br>
I may be the &#8220;best&#8221; teacher in my school, let alone the town, but does that mean I have the qualities and abilities of a principal too?</p>
<p><i>There are several theories about why, but a primary explanation has to do with minority students disproportionately receiving inferior educations compared to whites, he said.</i></p>
<p><b>Education is what you make of it</b> - don&rsquo;t blame others because <i>you</i> didn&rsquo;t pay attention.</p>
<p><i>During standardized tests, minorities are also vulnerable to performance anxieties that stem from cultural stereotypes, Foster said.</i></p>
<p>Yes, I succeeded at school largely because the Maori and Pacific Islanders <i>thought</i> I was smart because I was white.</p>
<p>Seriously? This is just plain ol&rsquo; daft.</p>

			<p>I was a master level fireman (NFPA standards), a fire engineer (driver), and a fire captain.  Ranks of captain and above are not &#8220;athletes&#8221; but scene and situation commanders making life and death decisions under stress.  Cognitive tests are appropriate.  Also if a person stresses out over a test, how can they expect to command a scene under stess?</p>

			<p>Memo to Houston&rsquo;s black firefighters:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Go to Detroit; you will be hired on the spot, no questions asked, and you will have plenty of fires to fight, all likely the result of black arsoninsts.<br>
Black city, black firefighters, and black arsonists&hellip;It just doesnt get any better than that!</p>

<p>OK, now that I&rsquo;ve got that out of my system, it&rsquo;s time to deconstruct this article.</p>

<p>No kidding?  Blacks don&rsquo;t do as well as Whites (or anyone else, for that matter) on &#8220;high-stakes&#8221; (i.e. IQ and aptitude) tests.  I wonder why?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;other criteria.&#8221;  In other words, Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do as well on these multiple-choice tests,&rdquo; said Capt. Otis Jordan, president of the Houston Black Firefighters Association.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unreal, even when they admit the obvious, it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; to call them on it!</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several theories about why, but a primary explanation has to do with minority students disproportionately receiving inferior educations compared to whites, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;primary explanation&#8221; of course, is the &#8220;official, politically correct&#8221; one.  Never mind they never enter ANYTHING  (other than blacks&rsquo; dismal test scores) in the way of evidence.  Of course, they NEVER mention the &#8220;other theory&#8221; is a biological one.  One wonders where they found this Marxist?</p>
<p>This article is a keeper.</p>

<p> Someone should keep track of all these excuses for poor black/minorities performances on standardized tests. There has to be hundreds and hundreds of them. A new one is put forth every year. The only one they dont seem to care for is the one that is most likely the actual reason for their low scores. And that is they dont possess the mental ability to compete.</p>

<p>If &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, admittedly, lack the intelligence and composure to do well on this test just as they lacked the intelligence, self control and discipline to learn while in school, how can they be expected to preform well in a command situation, which  would require far more of all four of those qualities?</p>

			<p>These are the kinds of issues that have come to light ever since blacks have been hired by fire departments throughout our nation. The tests that everyone else has to take for job entrance or for promotions are too tough for their small brains, and racism is always to blame for their shoddy education. I always thought that education was something you got from hard work and planning and not what someone gave you.  Old Ayn Rand was right when she said, &ldquo;the only way to kill greatness was to elevate mediocrity.&rdquo; Promote unqualified individuals and moral will always suffer. </p>

			<p>Way back in the 70&rsquo;s when I was about to graduate from Wayne State University in Detroit, we soon-to-be-grads had to assemble in one of the campus auditoriums to write a 250 word essay. Regardless of major, every student had to pass this simple (and widely known) exercise in order to receive their diploma.  </p>
<p>It was blindingly simple.  The instructors gave handouts  explaining that you had to introduce the subject, discuss it in the body, and then write the closing. 500 topics to choose from were listed on a separate sheet of paper, and an overhead projector kept the instructions, as explained verbally, cast on a huge screen in front of our huge group. A postcard came in the mail a week later telling if you passed or failed.  </p>
<p>I was already working at a job in my major when I read in The Detroit News how a large group of black students was suing the school for discrimination. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note here that Wayne State U in Detroit is and always has been just to the left of Karl Marx, politically. Political Correctness may have been born on this campus. Blacks with just over 1.5 high school GPAs were admitted as freshmen, and they were passed no matter which courses they took.  Dumbing down for black students and social promotions were the rules of the day at WSU.</p>
<p>After 4 years of, uh, &#8220;study&#8221;, they had failed the simple essay requirement. Their argument was that the requirement was biased against blacks due to the &#8220;fact&#8221; (sic) that writing essays were particularly difficult for their race. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the complaint in this AR article?  That multiple choice tests were too difficult for blacks?  What testing method is left?</p>
<p>A few weeks later I read where the black students vs. WSU lawsuit was thrown out of court. </p>
<p>Due to the absence of a healthy shame among blacks, and their near total disregard for learning while IN school, these idiotic lawsuits continue. Today, the courts appear to be so PC-corrupt that the litigants often win.  With the liberal messiah in the highest office, expect more of this insanity. After all, he&rsquo;s our first PC, affirmative action prez.    <br>

			<p>All of the comments (in comment section of chron)that oppose this law suite seem to disregard the fact that there is a certain element of truth to this article.<br>
Blacks don&rsquo;t do as well on tests because they are not as smart on average as European Americans or Asians. Pretending that this is not so will change nothing.<br>
Not one comment even dared to suggest this.<br>
If they did it would probably have been deleted by the good libs at the chron.<br>
The sad part is that even if they did study they would still have high failure rates.<br>
A goood friend of mine predicted years ago that African Americans would be the downfall of this once great country. He was correct times 1000.<br>
What is next? Affirmative action doctors? Engineers? Presidents?<br>
Theoretical physicists?</p>

			<p>Actually requiring knowledge and to be promoted! How dare they? A 100 word multiple choice test is really just a veiled attempt to suppress the Black man. Maybe if they just narrowed the choices down to two then Black persons would have an easier time passing. Who am I kidding? They&rsquo;d better just narrow the choices down to one answer to ensure the maximum Black success rate.</p>

			<p> Notice how, despite the statement that there are &#8220;several theories&#8221; why Whites tend to do better than blacks on the multiple-choice tests, the only one described in detail is the &#8220;blacks get an inferior education&#8221; canard. How about this addition to the original story:</p>
<p> &#8220;Another theory is that blacks, as a group, tend to have lower IQs than Whites, as a group. This has been proven in a multitude of IQ tests administered in a host of countries across the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p> Here&rsquo;s another point that would be interesting to explore, if one accepted the &#8220;IQ differential&#8221; theory: If there were a significant number of East Asian Americans who took the test as well, would their scores tend to be slightly higher than those of Whites? After all, they tend to score a few points higher, IQ-wise, than we do.</p>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t that a sport that Blacks dominate now.  Unfortunately although mostly Black, most teams still require a White head coach and a White quarterback to be successful.  Of course now if everyone in the NFL WERE Black we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say that because some team(&rsquo;s) would have to win the divisions and the Super Bowl anyway.  Hey, that&rsquo;s an idea why don&rsquo;t we just fire all the Whites and replace them with all Blacks?  Problem solved.  Don&rsquo;t worry; that wouldn&rsquo;t be racism.  Only Whites can be racist.</p>

			<p>Are not the property owners and residents the ones that matter in all of this? Firefighters are an emergency service the last time I checked not another destructive Marxist social experiment! How does lowering the standards of an emergency service help anyone?! Blacks have to be the most selfish race there is! They continually want positions and privileges they do not deserve! To be a firefighter you should be altruistic and Blacks simply do not have this characteristic enough!</p>

<p>Perhaps I should know better, but you have to be kidding.  A 250-word essay?  Is that the senior undergrad project?  About the only semi-difficult thing about it is that you had to have written it in an auditorium, right there, with pen and paper, choosing one of the many topics.  But what you are describing to me sounds more like an elementary school, not an undergraduate program at a university. </p>
<p>If that was the senior project, how easy were the classes?</p>
<p>Heck, everyone in my 7th grade class (and 8th grade, too) had to write 1,000 word MLA-compliant research papers just to pass the grade.  Not essays, mind you, papers, complete with thesis/es and citations.  999 words and you flunked.  The English teachers even scoured through drafts to mark out fluff words, and if they did, those words didn&rsquo;t get counted.  At least you were able to submit two drafts before the final.  And, of course, it had to be typed or word processed.  Your teacher in the subject closest to your paper got to give you half the grade for the substance of the content, the English teachers gave the other half of the grade for grammar/spelling/formatting/MLA compliance/etc.  7th Grade.  Not in the 1970s, in 1990.  I remember my paper in the 7th was about the importance of the North Carolina tobacco crop in funding the Confederate war effort in the WBTS (I had visited NC the summer before, that&rsquo;s where I got the idea), my 8th grade one was on the enviro-ecological phenomenon called thermal inversion.  My science teacher, who got to grade that paper because it was about science, took off points for not defining &#8220;thermal inversion&#8221; where I should have within the paper, and the English teacher did, too.  Point is, seemed like my middle school years were tougher than Wayne State University.</p>

<p>I will not do well on this test because:<br>
 (a) I feel performance anxiety because I am a minority.<br>
 (b) The test is racist.<br>
 (c) All tests are racist.<br>
 (c) I am a superior athlete.<br>

			<p>I am acquainted with an intelligent White woman married to a Black man.  Sometimes, she speaks for him among Whites because, as he says, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not too good with words&#8221;.  OK, let&rsquo;s allow the possibility that he was poorly educated in inferior schools.  So why hasn&rsquo;t he, in the 20+ years they&rsquo;ve been married and living in the 2500 sq ft ranch style house with the big yard in the nice neighborhood that her family provided, read some books and learned to be &#8220;good with words&#8221;?  I can only conclude that &#8220;not too good with words&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;dumb as a rock&#8221;.  <br>
     If the Black firemen want to lose their test anxiety, maybe they should become more familiar with the written word.  </p>

			<p>According to the article the test was given last year. This was before Barak Obama became president. Now that he is president, the Obama effect will raise the scores of all African hyphenates to equal or exceed the Caucasian level. Simply readminister the tests; in Obama America, there will no longer be any racial differential. Problem solved.</p>

			<p>Sheer madness! The idea that lives are going to be endangered in the name of &#8220;political correctness&#8221; just shows the horrid depths to which liberals and minorities will sink. Sadly, this has become the norm; in Chicago, for instance, the tests have already been changed to pass-fail because the City bowed to minority pressure. </p>

			<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t make the Wayne State story up. My first post is the gospel truth. A well-written 250 word essay was required to graduate. It was the truth back then, but I don&rsquo;t know if it is today. I forgot to add that the school gave us 3 hours to write the essay. </p>
<p>The reason was that the public was complaining back then that college grads couldn&rsquo;t even write a coherent sentence, let alone verbally express a complete thought. Wayne State wanted to make sure that everyone who graduated could do write competently. Image and reputation, you know. Like I said in my first post, it was blindingly simple. </p>
<p>In my freshman year at Wayne the classes were packed with black students and those, mostly from Detroit public schools. These classes were the prerequisite English, sociology, history and economics courses.  The black students were shamefully &#8220;unprepared&#8221;, to keep things civil here in describing their performance. Few could even speak a complete sentence intelligibly. </p>
<p>In my sophomore year, the classrooms and labs got whiter.  Having a Bachelor of Science degree, I had a minor in physics, and those classes and labs were a mix of Caucasians and Asians only. No Blacks or Hispanics were present.</p>
<p>In my junior and senior years there were few blacks. Most had taken their government grants and dropped out.  </p>
<p>All of my profs demanded accomplished writing skills with the expectation of heavy-duty editing before ANY paper was turned in, no matter how short. These teachers were so accomplished that they could tell right off if you wrote one hastily. It didn&rsquo;t matter if the paper was a hard science result, a journal entry, a clinical description, or of the creative type; it HAD to be well written. In most of my classes, you had one chance to do a re-write, and if that was poor, you received a failing grade that day. At least such was the case for me and other Whites - and Asians.  </p>
<p>You can ask, but I&rsquo;m clueless how the approximately 200 blacks made it to the essay requirement prior to graduation.  The vast majority of them dropped out prior to their junior year as opposed to &#8220;flunked&#8221; out. I do know that, as some black students told me, some blacks paid whites to write their class papers.</p>
<p>By the way, those who did&rsquo;t pass the grad requirement had to take a remedial English course the next semester (and pay for it), and were allowed to again write the essay.  If they didn&rsquo;t write it competently again, the cycle was supposed to continue. </p>
<p>I have to add here, for a little mirth, that a buddy and I had completed all of our classes for the semester, and were scheduled to graduate.  Like me, he was a military veteran, and since we were scheduled write the essay in the late afternoon, we hit the corner pub just off campus for a few brewskis.  We wrote our essays with a good buzz on, and both of us finished in about 20 or 30 minutes.  Then we headed back to the bar to celebrate.  And yep, we both graduated on time.       </p>

			<p>One more for &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221;:</p>
<p>You asked if the classes were easy at Wayne State University.  The answer is, most were not, unless it was a sociology, humanities or history class. Those were very easy. </p>
<p>Most of the prerequisite courses, however, were involved, but not challenging as far as I was concerned. My hard science classes caused more than a few nights of sleeplessness, and many hours of study. Those classes were, as one of my profs put it, &#8220;study hard or get the hell out&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was common to have to write a 25 to 50 page paper for just about any class at Wayne - back then. </p>

			<p>IQ tests measure ones lifelong attitude towards learning. Those who score lower are simply not as interested in the outside world. Or, put another way, they end up with a lower IQ because of their own lifelong love of ignorant, backward, and racist behavior. Or in other words - as hard as it may be to make the connection, those who score lower have an excess of ignorance.<br>

 Since quotas, never called such, is always the goal of these type activists, this shouldn&rsquo;t be a big issue. Demographics show that the number of Black firemen is the percentage of Blacks in Houston&rsquo;s population.<br>
 But the truth is that once numerical &#8220;equality&#8221; is reached there is ALWAYS some other issue blamed on racism which the activists demand be addressed immediately.</p>

			<p>The white race has gotten weak because to many young people rely on their parents for success. George Bush is a good example, under any normal circumstances he would have ended up selling used cars at best. </p>
<p>The black race is getting weak because of affirmative action, there is just no way to separate the strong and smart from the weak and dumb.</p>
<p>Until we get back to the natural order of things our society will continue to deteriorate. People that have to earn what they get tend to hold on to it at all cost and those that are given a free ride are  much more lax, they just assume that life should be easy for everyone because it was for them. </p>
<p>In many ways I feel that the collapse of our society will be the only thing that can save it. </p>

So let me get this straight,blacks whined about segregated schools because black schools didn&rsquo;t offer as good of an education as white schools. The liberals then put them in white schools and they STILL claim that they get an inferior education.<br>
So lets break this down.<br>
Blacks claim that:<br>
Blacks in black schools are uneducated.<br>
Blacks in white schools are uneducated.<br>
What is the common denominator here?<br>

<p>Not really&hellip;. One is born short or tall with no chance to work to change that strictly genetic determination (sans starving society).  In contrast, a mind is something that can be excercized, trained and improved through use.  Even a genetically &#8220;inferior&#8221; brain can be improved through discipline and application, just as a brilliant one can be wasted through disuse and abuse.</p>

were already dumbed down in 2005 as part of a &#8220;collective agreement&#8221;. They used to be written tests, seems most likely they could not write so they compromised by making tick marks only. The inability to write should have clued them up at the time that if they could not write they likely did not know the answers either.</p>

<p>Here, we have a prime example of blacks&rsquo; typical illogical reasoning.  Academic tests, such as the SAT, do not measure the tester&rsquo;s ability to play football, whereas firefighting tests do measure the tester&rsquo;s ability to practice firefighting.  But we wouldn&rsquo;t expect blacks to understand the fallacy of this argument   &mdash;   after all, that&rsquo;s why they miserably fail these multiple choice tests in the first place.</p>

			<p>It is not the test itself but the questions that favor whites. All that is needed is a &#8220;black&#8221; oriented test such as:</p>
<p>Question One.</p>
<p>You are called to put out a fire at a civic center where an organization known as NWA is playing; NWA is:</p>
<p>1. a woman&rsquo;s organization - New Women&rsquo;s Alliance.<br>
2. an air line pilots&rsquo; ball - North West Airlines.<br>
3. an anti war group  - No Wars Anymore.<br>
4. A RAP GROUP!</p>
<p>Question Two.</p>
<p>You are called to put out a fire where the King lives - we are talking about:</p>
<p>1. a house in Memphis. <br>
2. a palace in London. <br>
3. a dog house behind the fire station.<br>
4. A PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER&rsquo;S HOUSE IN CLEVELAND!  </p>
<p>Question Three:</p>
<p>A &#8220;drop top cat&#8221; refers to:</p>
<p>1. a stripper.<br>
2. a feline.<br>
3. a rapper wearing his pants low.<br>
4. A CAR!</p>
<p>Question Four:   </p>
<p>You are called to put out a fire at the &#8220;ice house&#8221;. We are talking here about:</p>
<p>1. a skating rink.<br>
2. an immigration enforcement agency.<br>
3. a funeral home.<br>
4. A HOUSE WHERE ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE MANUFACTURED AND USED!</p>
<p>Question Five:</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t go to the fire because you had been &#8220;bitten&#8221; by a &#8220;mad dog&#8221;. By &#8220;mad dog&#8221; we mean.</p>
<p>1. a canine.<br>
2. a girlfriend&rsquo;s husband.<br>
3. a sexually transmitted disease.<br>
4. YOU GOT DRUNK ON CHEAP WINE!  </p>
<p>Question six.</p>
<p>The late &#8220;singer&#8221; Notorious B.I.G. died </p>
<p>1. from being locked in a house fire.<br>
2. from being locked in a motel fire.<br>
3. from being locked in an office building fire.<br>
4. SOMETHING ELSE! </p>
<p>Question seven.</p>
<p>One of the occupants which you save from a burning house was &#8220;illing&#8221; We mean by the term &#8220;illing&#8221; that the man was:  </p>
<p>1. overcome by smoke inhalation.<br>
2. was suffering from being burned.<br>
3. was irrational. <br>
4. WAS DEAD DRUNK [AS IN HE BE &#8220;ILLING&#8221;]! </p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s not the fact that the test was multiple choice, but rather, it&rsquo;s the choices themselves which made it unfair to blacks.</p>

They are multiple choice for gods sake!!! Its not fill in the blanks or essay type or these people would really be in trouble.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dead-right!<br>
The answers are right there in front of you and even if you weren&rsquo;t paying that much attention in the first place (when the facts were recited right in front of you ten odd times through training courses) odds on you could recall more than half of them eh? And thus at least pass the test.<br>
A straight question and answer test must be terribly racist!</p>
<p>I did a course years ago at a &#8216;higher&rsquo; education institution and was introduced to &#8216;competency testing&rsquo;, that is, if a person fails that&rsquo;s cooool man - they&rsquo;ll keep giving you the test until you pass. After that, everyone passes, the person that got all the questions correct the first time and the person that had three goes to pass. <br>

			<p>I know this is a bit off topic.</p>
<p>I remember years ago that a black man took the test for sargent<br>
in the NYPD. He failed and was told he&rsquo;d be promoted anyway because he was black. He refused the promotion and said he&rsquo;d just wait until the next test came up and retake the exam. This account was reported in the NY Daily News. A couple of years later, there was a small item in the paper saying he&rsquo;d passed the new test and was promoted. That was the last time I ever heard of a black taking failure like a man and just preparing himself better for the next exam. Ever since then, all blacks have only whined and carried on until the received what they wanted when they wanted, just like spoiled children.</p>
<p>Does anyone here remember a similar story?</p>

			<p>I took a few anthropology classes in college, several years ago; and I never encountered the term &#8220;education anthropologist&#8221; either. The anthropology curriculum was subdivided into physical anthropology, archaeology and cultural anthropology.</p>
<p>I guess an &#8220;education anthropologist&#8221; is someone who studies the test scores of different races, and then comes up with explanations of why there is the variance between test scores.</p>
<p>You cannot have diversity and equality. The two are mutually exclusive. Whoever heard of Caucasians, blacks, mestizos and Orientals scoring 100 percent on every exam in an advanced integral calculus or nuclear physics course in every college and university in the USA? It just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<i>&#8220;As I have stated many times before, Blacks only do what Whites encourage and allow them to do.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely true. The problem is that there are forces at the federal level who have the power to trump facts and reality for political purposes.</p>
<p>This fire department was only doing what they had done every test cycle without regard to race. Everyone took the same classes. Everyone had the same time frame to study for the test. Everyone had the same study manuals and practice tests. When black complained, they have an all too eager federal bureaucracy in place to crush this fire department and make them play by bureaucratic rules, not reality and they know it. People in these positions are often forced out or replaced when they fail to &#8216;follow the rules&rsquo; or they resign in protest and are replace with compliant department heads. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that whites allow this but are forced to comply or be destroyed. This fire department doesn&rsquo;t want to allow this to happen but what power do they have to fight it?</p>
<p>How to you fight irrationality with logic when the federal bureaucracy is irrational?</p>

			<p>I remember an episode of the comedy show &#8220;Different Strokes&#8221;, one of the TV shows meant to demonstrate to us how blacks can and always do enrich the lives of Whites dealt with this very subject. The two black children in the show had failed an entrance test to a fancy private school. The crux of the show was that all of these tests are racist because they do not include questions about things that are culturally significant to blacks. In the final scene, the two black children humiliate the headmaster by asking him questions about the &#8220;blues&#8221;, seeking to confuse him and demonstrate that his questions about &#8220;White&#8221; literature, music, and science were unfair. He should be ashamed for even asking such insensitive questions.</p>
<p>At the time, I failed to see how the two things were similar. 2+2=4 no matter what. I guess now, the comedy show has come true. We have people among us who look us in the eye and give us the &#8220;WATCHOOOTALKINBOUTWILLIS?&#8221; and we are meant to take them seriously. I guess the black firefighter does want questions about rap music and collard greens and maybe dashiki design included on a test designed to measure suitability for command in emergency situations like terror attacks, fires, and natural disasters. </p>
<p>As an Italian-American, I should demand they alter the LSAT exam to include questions about lasagna, Dean Martin music, fine shoes, loan sharking, and pizza!! I&rsquo;d get in to Harvard!</p>

<p> The flaw in your reasoning is that none of your &#8220;black&#8221; questions have anthing to do with FIREFIGHTING. The tests are not designed to check how black you are but how much intelligence and aptitude you have. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Your best athlete might not be the straight-A student&#8221;,,,</p>
<p>HUH? What the hell does that mean. The A-student is not on the football team. Such wierd irrational black &#8220;logic&#8221;.</p>
<p> I can&rsquo;t think of anything that can be easier then a multiple choice test. You are already GIVEN the right answer. You simply have to pick it out from the false ones. Even if you don&rsquo;t know a random guess could still be right. </p>
<p> Question number five: What number is closest to 10. a)15 b)18 C)25 D)17. You simply use a process of logical elimination. Nothing could be easier then multiple choice. You just choose the most right answer.</p>

			<p>As far as the &#8220;inferior schools&#8221; argument goes, I was privy to the affirmative action promotions in the Pontiac (MI) Police Department back in the 80s.  The test results for sergeant came out and only one black, a female, scored in the top 10 (she was #7, I believe), and the next black after her in regard to scores was #44.  The department was to promote 10 people to sergeant so the black woman made the rank, and #44 was the next after a white.  Their affirmative action rule was that for every white promoted, a black had to be promoted.  </p>
<p>Of course, the result was a tremendously dumbed-down department, and today the city of Pontiac is almost 100% black and hispanic. It also goes without saying that it&rsquo;s also now third-world with mega-high crime and the resultant filthy conditions.  </p>
<p>The black police chief also likes to hang out at the local black motorcycle gang clubhouse, the same place where 2 dead bodies were found last year.  His attitude regarding his recreational activities was, &#8220;so what?&#8221;. </p>
<p>The point is that way back when the affirmative action comedy began and took place, ALL OF THE CANDIDATES, WHITE AND BLACK, WENT TO THE SAME PUBLIC SCHOOLS.    </p>

			<p>The catch in this problem is the multicults look at the fact that blacks perform poorly on tests and view it as proof of racial discrimination.  We view it as proof of racial differences.</p>
