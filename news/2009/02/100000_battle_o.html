<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AN angry headteacher is suing &#8220;gutless&#8221; education chiefs for £100,000 for not backing her against Muslim school &#8220;bullies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Erica Connor claims her bosses did nothing as a group of Muslim governors tried to force her to change the school curriculum.</p>
<p>She also says she was &#8220;harassed&#8221; by the four-strong team as they demanded the pupils be taught more about Allah and Islam.</p>
<p>And they tried to &#8220;railroad&#8221; her into linking up with the local mosque and focusing on Muslim worship, says the 57-year-old head, who has taken her fight to London&rsquo;s High Court.</p>
<p>Erica is suing Surrey education bosses for &#8220;turning their back&#8221; on her as Muslim rivals branded her &#8220;racist and Islamophobic&#8221;.</p>
<p>She said she felt under personal attack when investigating bosses branded her &#8220;unresponsive to the needs of the faith community&#8221;, adding: &#8220;This was racism towards me. I felt that, had I been a Muslim head, things would have been conducted in a different way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that they didn&rsquo;t have the courage to stand by me in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Erica, who says she is so depressed she may never work again, reckons bosses should have done a lot more to protect her and New Monument School.</p>
<p>The mum-of-one said her troubles began in 2003 when four Muslim governors were appointed, including convert Paul Martin and Mumtaz Saleem.</p>
<p>They took control of reg-ular meetings, repeatedly demanding more formal Islamic worship in the predominantly Muslim school and closer ties with the nearby mosque in Woking.</p>
<p>When she fought back, Mr Martin claimed the ethos of the school was racist and alleged she believed Pakistanis were &#8220;less intelligent&#8221;.</p>
<p>An investigation later found she &#8220;had not been responsive to the needs of the faith community&#8221;.</p>
<p>Erica told Judge John Leighton Williams QC she was &#8220;horrified&#8221; by the conclusion, which she believes  made her &#8220;a helpless scapegoat&#8221;.</p>
<p>Council lawyers are fighting her claim for damages.</p>
<p>The hearing continues.<br>

			<p>Whites will continue to be pushed around, because the elites are sissies, afraid to stick up for what is right, and it demoralizes the white population into accepting abuse also, which in turn reinforces the cowardice of the elites.</p>
<p>Whites, in general,  will have to suffer much more injustices before they are ready to fight back, and part of those injustices will will amount to being passed over for scarce jobs time and again, because of their race.</p>
<p>And it looks like that is just what is going to occur, as Robert Reich told Congress, &#8220;No white males,&#8221; should benefit from the stimulus package.  </p>
<p>But, for now, no one will dare utter a word for fear of being thought racist, let alone fight back.</p>

			<p>It would appear that no one is prepared to stand up against the muslims, lest they be &#8220;outraged&#8221; and riot.</p>

			<p>When are people in the US and Britain going to realize that they have brought this on themselves by voting for leftists for many years.  In this country the leftists are in the democrat party, in Britain they are in the labour party.  You see stories like this over and over, whether it is in the US, Canada, Britain, Sweden etc.  This problem has a common root  &mdash;   crazed leftist idealogy which is not limited to any one country but is an idealogy that has spread thoughout the western countries.  People have to throw leftists out of office.  Take away their power and never let them get back in power again.  If the people had the wisdom to do this for ten or twenty years you would see all of the power of political correctness wither away.</p>
