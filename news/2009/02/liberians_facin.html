<h1>Liberians Facing Mass Deportation From U.S.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Marrapodi and Chris Welch, CNN, February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of Liberians living in the United States face deportation March 31 when a federal immigration status created for humanitarian purposes expires.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, a bloody civil war raged through the West African nation, killing 250,000 people and displacing more than a million, according to a U.N. report. The United States extended &#8220;temporary protection status&#8221; to all Liberians who could get to America, and 14,000 of them took advantage of that humanitarian offer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, the temporary protection status for Liberians was extended as the situation there worsened under dictator Charles Taylor. But Taylor was ousted in 2003 and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected Liberia&rsquo;s first female president in 2006. In 2007, citing the progress in Liberia, President George W. Bush signed an order of &#8220;delayed enforced departure&#8221; for Liberians who had been under temporary protection status, giving them 18 months to return to Liberia.<br>
 <br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services said approximately 3,600 Liberian nationals are facing delayed enforced departure, but Liberian community leaders think the number may be twice that because, they said, many Liberians went underground and did not reregister with immigration services, knowing the delayed enforced departure status meant leaving the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these Liberians have become important parts of the communities where they live in the United States,&#8221; said Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island. There is a large Liberian community in his home state.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have children who are citizens of the U.S.,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;How do you leave children behind who are eligible to stay? They&rsquo;ve worked very hard, they&rsquo;ve played by the rules, and they&rsquo;ve paid their taxes. They&rsquo;re here legally. I think that should be considered at least to let them stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reed has been one of the driving forces for extension of the temporary protection status in previous years and is pushing hard again this year for another extension. In addition, he wants a change in the rule that prohibits those on the temporary protection status classification from applying for citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should have the right to become American citizens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They should be part of immigration reform. We shouldn&rsquo;t pick and choose different immigrant groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Critics say Liberians should go back to Liberia when their status runs out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time for people to go back and rebuild their country,&#8221; said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. {snip}</p>

			<p>SHOW ME the hard-working Liberians!!!  SHOW ME that they pay taxes and are not on welfare!!  AND unless one parent is a legal US citizen, the children born here are NOT!  SHOW ME that they contribute and have assimilated!</p>
<p>Liberia is typical of what blacks do when left to their own devices,&hellip; CHAOS and murder and poverty.  </p>

			<p>The Government of Canada in 2003 announced that foreigners living in Canada with protected person status could apply for a student loan.  The Canadian taxpayer is financing these people, while many of our own can not afford tuition.  </p>
<p>What are the chances these people are going to pay back the loan if they are denied citizenship and deported&hellip;..</p>

<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t, the children are free to go with their parents, but go they must.</p>

			<p>As the Chinese say, a trip of a thousand miles starts with one step. Hopefully, we can finally begin tossing out the Mexican invaders and their Anchor Babies next.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Only&#8221; 17 years?  Better late than never, I suppose.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the anchor babies these Liberians have doubtless been producing in droves will be returning with their parents.</p>

			<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that the whole point of the foundation of Liberia  &mdash;  to give former American slaves a place to go to where they could be among their own people and rule themselves?  </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the greatest irony of all!  The descendants of former U.S. slaves wanting to come back to the U.S.A. because the country they failed to build on their own is a complete  failure?  Who would have guessed?</p>

			<p>Once again we get to see that &#8220;temporary&#8221; really means permanent. Is it any wonder Americans are just absolutely cynical with idiots like this Reed fellow running the show. Dan Stein is absolutely correct how does the US government expect bad situations in other countries to improve when we allow their populations to throw up their arms, claim &#8220;refugee&#8221; status and just move to the US. If they want better living conditions in their own countries stay their and fight for them. </p>

			<p>The most important question raised by this article is: Why are not *all* refugees, particularly those from Somalia and other muslim countries, legally required to return home when possible to do so? Or perhaps even sooner?</p>

Not one will be forced to return.</p>
<p>And yes, the irony is glaring. Escaping Liberia, the nation created to help slaves return to Africa who now want to escape Africa.</p>

			<p>The most outrageous aspect of this story is that Jack Reed is a United States Senator from RHODE ISLAND. Last month, Rhode Island&rsquo;s unemployment rate reached 10%, its highest since 1975. The state is second in unemployment only to Michigan, where the rate is 10.6%. And Senator Reed is concerned about guests who have overstayed their welcome? </p>

			<p><i>The most important question raised by this article is: Why are not *all* refugees, particularly those from Somalia and other muslim countries, legally required to return home when possible to do so? Or perhaps even sooner?</i></p>
<p>If that were the goal, they would not have been brought here in the first place.  Liberia is not exactly adjacent to the United States.  Nor is Iraq, nor is Somalia, nor is Sudan.  </p>
<p>I have noticed that the UN virtually never pressures non-white countries to permanently accept refugees (including first-world nations such as Japan); as a result, these countries simply cordon them off in camps and wait for the UN to ship them out to Canada, Australia, England or here.   </p>

			<p>As if anyone needed further proof in the statement that &#8220;there is nothing more permanent than temporary asylum&#8221;. This policy will continue forever as long as people are allowed to remain here for years by the do-gooders who drag them over here, and their ever-virtuous political hack enablers. As long as we give away citizenship like candy at Halloween, as long as the rest of the world looks upon us as a dumping ground, we will forever be plagued by a never ending stream of refugees. And to think politicians from states with 10% unemployment are advocating this. I&rsquo;ll retire to Bedlam. </p>

<p>We gave them their own country in AFRICA! and the blacks promptly turned it into a Detroit slum, go figure.</p>
