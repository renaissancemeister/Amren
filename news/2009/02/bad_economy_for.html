<h1><a href="https://www.27east.com/story_detail.cfm?id=193118">Bad Economy Forces Some Migrant Workers Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyn Kormann, East Hampton Press, February 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some local immigrants have returned to their native countries or are planning to leave because of the lack of work. While most people in the immigrant community are staying, the flow of their money, which usually travels from East Hampton to Latin America via money wires, has reversed.</p>
<p>In the communications hub called Latin Express, a hair salon, Elsa Crespo, who works behind the counter and hails from Ecuador, said on Thursday she thinks that about 70 percent of the immigrant community in the area is without work and that people are starting to leave.</p>
<p>But the main change she has noticed is that people are receiving money wires, when &#8220;before they were always sending money to their home countries,&#8221; she said in Spanish.</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that, at most, there would be one person in a month who was receiving money. Now what I&rsquo;m seeing is 10 people per day who are receiving money from their home countries. No one is sending money home.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Crespo agreed. &#8220;Look how many rooms are available,&#8221; she said, pointing at the bulletin board near the door full of ads offering rooms. &#8220;It&rsquo;s much more than normal. Every day people are coming in with rooms for rent  &mdash;  there have never been this many. It&rsquo;s a signal that people have left.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some people have simply decided that it&rsquo;s not worth it to stay here any longer, according to Isabel Sepúlveda de Scanlon, the president of the Organización Latino Americana (OLA) of Eastern Long Island. &#8220;Many friends have said they know someone who has left or is leaving to go back to their home country,&#8221; Ms. Sepúlveda said. &#8220;Business owners are cutting pay. Cabaña Latina has laid people off.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some immigrants, while the bad economy has left them without work, they also see it as a blessing in disguise because it means that going home is their best option. Marcelo Guevara, of Southampton, recently lost his job and decided to go home because he could find no other work. But he said he&rsquo;s thrilled that he will finally get to see his family after too many years,</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farther west, the situation seems even more dire. Sister Margaret Smyth of the North Fork Hispanic Apostolate, based in Riverhead, said that since October, she has bought return tickets for 17 immigrants to four different locations  &mdash;  Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&rsquo;t work and they are getting depressed,&#8221; Sister Smyth said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s becoming overwhelming, so they&rsquo;re going home. Some people have come in, sat down and cried because they haven&rsquo;t worked in three or four months, so they&rsquo;re broken down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigrant families are more stable here, as opposed to single men, who seem to be the main demographic that is leaving or considering leaving. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the single guys, the migrant workers, who might be starting to go,&#8221; said Dan Hartnett, a social worker in the East Hampton School District.</p>
<p>Evidence that families are not leaving comes from school enrollment statistics. There have not been more withdrawals in the East Hampton School District in the last couple months than normal, Superintendant Ray Gaultieri said. &#8220;Enrollment has been pretty steady for the last couple years. I think if there aren&rsquo;t jobs for families when spring comes, then people might start to leave,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the Montauk School, there has not been a decrease in enrollment and Superintendant Jack Perna said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat out here in the winter. This fall was a little off, businesswise, but in the winter, you do nothing anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Springs School has actually seen a slight increase in enrollment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in order to stay here and try to get by, several families will crowd into one house, which has been a source of contention with the town&rsquo;s Ordinance Enforcement Department for years.</p>
<p>Dominic Schirrippa, the Ordinance Enforcement director, said that the winter is always quiet in terms of housing violations and that he hasn&rsquo;t necessarily seen a change in the Latino population.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of housing violation tickets we give out is declining because we&rsquo;ve stepped up enforcement in the last few years,&#8221; he said. Since the beginning of 2009, the department has ticketed two houses, which he said is about the same as last year at this time.</p>

			<p>But the main change she has noticed is that people are receiving money wires, when &ldquo;before they were always sending money to their home countries,&rdquo; she said in Spanish&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Funny  we have a little strip mall which more or less qualifies as out on little Mexico City. It has one of the stores which advertises money transfers.It used to have the flags of mexico,guatemala,honduras and nicaragua flying above it along with the american flag flying at the same height. While driving my daughter home from school today I noticed all the flags from those Hispanic countries were gone.The only one left wes the american flag. Now as soon as that Loco Pollo chicken restaurant closes next door I will then celebrate.</p>

			<p>Let me think now (maybe you should too),with the liberal democrats now in office, they should tax the money being sent BACK into the country since it wasn&rsquo;t taxed when it left!I am appauld at the fact i have to press #1 for English,have my banking institution let illegals send money to mexico for free while I have to pay fees through the nose just to have what little money I have saved up in the last 35 years in their bank disappear due to the fees. I am fed up with these news articles appealing to the AMERICAN people to forgive and feel sorry for these illegal people. Do you think AMERICANS would be treated the same in their country ? NO!  People that came to this country prior to the complacency and apathy mind set would kiss the ground and thank GOD and AMERICA for the opportunity that has come their way.Many men and women have died ensuring the freedoms that we have come to take for granted and we had better open our eyes,kiss our grandchildren, and pray that we see what is coming.Lets be proactive instead of reactive before it is too late.</p>

			<p>Ever since the supposed recession began, I have noticed a positive development. No more Mexicans stealing bottles and cans from the recycling bins at night. They used to be getting them 5 minutes after I put them out.They must have gone back to paradise(Mexico).</p>

			<p> Just wait until they strain and social services<br>
dry. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll have their bags packed ready to go<br>
home. Or more likely,some other White nation they can <br>
strain. For a people as hard working and full of virtue,<br>
as the media claims they are. Why is it that their homelands<br>
never reflect this ? Why can&rsquo;t they stay and fix their<br>
homelands ?</p>

			<p>I live in South Carolina (home from Iraq at the moment) and a few days ago I saw the first rolling taco, burrito and other mexican food bread type truck leaving Myrtle Beach airport. The lettering was in English and Spanish!!thought for a moment that I was back in L.A.!</p>

			<p>If they are sending for money from home, that certainly shoots the dubious theory that they are all here just &#8220;trying to feed their families&#8221; and similar nonsense full of holes! If &#8220;home&#8221; can afford to send cash, perhaps they had better go back there&hellip;where the money is!!</p>

			<p>There is no reason to think they are going home. Our communist Congress just extended S-CHIP to children of illegals. They&rsquo;re considering amnesty. As the one principal said, there are no more withdrawls than normal and I have yet to see reports of declining school enrollment.</p>
<p>Most importantly: <a href="https://www.rightsidenews.com/200902033554/border-and-sovereignty/us-legislative-immigration-update-february-3-2009.html" rel="nofollow">remittances to Mexico</a> only fell by 3.6% between 2007 and 2008. School enrollment and remittances are probably the most reliable indicators of how many illegals we have: remittances for the illegals whose families are still back home, enrollments for thoe whose families are here.</p>
<p>I expect, hope and pray that we will see better data in the fall for enrollments and next January for remittances, but I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it.</p>

			<p>Less work may not be the only reason some Hispanics are going home. Yesterday, a Mexican was murdered during a home invasion robbery by two blacks. There was another similar killing just a few weeks ago.  Targeting Mexicans for their cash seems to be a popular pastime for local black thugs.</p>
<p>I want the Mexicans to go home. However, I wish blacks would pick up on the work ethic that many Mexicans seem to have.</p>

			<p>I live on eastern Long Island, and read this article in the local paper a few days ago. There was another article right next to it in which one of the larger east end towns held a meeting about &#8220;our immigrant community&#8221;. Congressman Tim Bishop was at the meeting as well as some local politicians and people from the community. The pro-illegals,including Bishop, got to voice their opinions on how we need the illegals aliens or businesses would fail. The anti-illegal immigrant group was basically ignored when they raised their hands on concerns about community. Eastern Long Island has a huge population of liberal democrates that do not believe in enforcing our immigration laws, they just want their properties kept up cheap. They are the bleeding heart liberals from NYC that could care less about the middle class that are the firemen, policemen and small business owners, but yet have sympathy for the illegals. I hope Sister Smyth buys a lot more tickets, but from what I see she&rsquo;s got a long way to go.</p>

			<p>Most importantly: remittances to Mexico only fell by 3.6% between 2007 and 2008. School </p>
<p>I suspect the decline may be because those here no longer have family left in Mexico or further south, having finally gotten all of their family members into the U.S.</p>

<p>You are absolutely correct.  They hire the illegals because they are cheap.  The government looks the other way as they pay the illegals CASH.  YET,.. the WHITE AMERICAN who is in business doing all the right things, paying all the insurances and taxes, is having a harder time by the day, competing with these people.  But the government has no trouble harrassing the legal guys for their tax payments and making sure THEY follow the rules.   And not for nothing, but I have seen the work of these illegals who are picked up under the bridges in Norwalk, CT and other places.  They haven&rsquo;t a clue as to what they are doing and have destroyed beautiful trees by girdling them with the weed whackers,.. then the employers don&rsquo;t want to make good on the trees their cheap help destroyed.  </p>

			<p>So a comparative HANDFUL OF ILLEGALS left our country. That still leaves some 30 million that should be driven out! I am tired of hearing about how &#8220;good&#8221; immigration is for us. All I have to do is read the newspapers, count the crimes, the DWI accidents&hellip; and draw my own conclusion. Given that illegal immigrants (Mostly Mexican) and Blacks do about 85% of the crime in our country. That the tax burden on American tax payers is roughly 90 BILLION ANNUALLY to prop up and support illegal aliens. For FREE health care, welfare supplements, educational benefits, even for incarcerating felons&hellip; all eventually paid for by you, me and other American taxpayers!</p>
<p>Bottom line is Americans should NOT be required to carry the rest of Latin America on our backs. Let them take care of their own. Drive &#8216;em out now!</p>

			<p>How are illegals getting on U.S aircraft? Answer: with state issued drivers licenses. Think about how screwed up this is.</p>

			<p>I believe that when enough 3rd world immigrants smother our country and the economy fails, an equilibrium will result and they will stop flooding into America. Of course by then it will be too late and the USA will be just like any other poor, have-not nation. That day is not far off.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve known many blacks from Africa and the <br>
Caribbean who display plenty of work ethic.  Its unlikely they&rsquo;ll pass it on to their U.S. born children, just like the Mexicans won&rsquo;t pass it on to theirs.  The next generation of Mexicans will grow up resentful that they don&rsquo;t have the same things as whites, and the liberals will feed their resentment by blaming it on racism.  After all, they are Americans right?  Shouldn&rsquo;t all Americans have the same things?  The Mexicans that demonstrate ability anywhere close to their white peers will get preferences, the others will more likely just get angry.  Not a good situation.</p>

<p>Unless, as has been painfully revealed in recent weeks, &#8220;THEY&#8221; are the ones who MAKE THE RULES!!! and are therefore (apparently) exempt from following those rules!!</p>

			<p>Remittances to Mexico have not dropped of in the slightest&hellip;if you substitute the phrase &#8220;profits from drug sales&#8221; for the word &#8220;remittances.&#8221; If anything, they have increased. What has only changed is the recipient of the &#8220;remittances.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Para la pandilla de droga, todo. Para esos no de la pandilla de droga, nada.&#8221; </i> &#8220;For the drug gang, everything. For those not of the drug gang, nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the new reality for the average Mexican, I would guess.</p>
