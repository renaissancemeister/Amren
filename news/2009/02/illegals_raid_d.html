			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrant rights groups blasted President Obama on Wednesday for breaking what they called his &#8220;personal commitment&#8221; to change Bush-era immigration raids after U.S. authorities raided an engine machine shop in Washington state and detained illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The Obama administration itself seemed taken aback by the raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano vowing to Congress that she would &#8220;get to the bottom of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said &#8220;these raids are not a long-term solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The raid in Bellingham, Wash., was the first major workplace enforcement action since Mr. Obama took office, but the second time a law enforcement action has angered the White House.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During last year&rsquo;s presidential campaign, Mr. Obama criticized immigration work-site raids as &#8220;ineffective&#8221; and said the focus instead should be on employers who hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Immigrant rights groups said this week&rsquo;s raid seemed to go against that.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a fixture of our conversations and demands with him during the campaign. It has always been one that there would be a hold on the raids or a stop to the raids until there was a through review of its effectiveness and whether it has been a fiscally responsible course of action,&#8221; said Cynthia Buiza, director of policy and advocacy at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. &#8220;This is all about holding public officials accountable to the things they promised during the campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Council of La Raza urged supporters to call the White House and demand Mr. Obama lay out his immigration policy, while the National Immigration Forum said the raid was an unwelcome continuation of Bush administration policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are Latino and immigrant voters to think? They turn out in massive numbers and vote for change and yet &#8216;change we can believe in&rsquo; turns out to be &#8216;business as usual,&rsquo;&#8221; said Ali Noorani, executive director of the forum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement, ICE said the raid was the result of a gang investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Information derived from two gang members previously arrested in an ICE gang operation led to the initiation of the work-site investigation at Yamato Engine Specialists,&#8221; said press secretary Kelly Nantel. &#8220;Follow-up investigation uncovered a potentially large number of illegally employed workers. ICE conducted the operation in order to identify and if appropriate, apprehend any unauthorized workers and to further determine potential criminal activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Napolitano said she expects ICE actions at work sites to focus on employers &#8220;who intentionally and knowingly exploit the illegal labor market.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Sec. Napolitano, in the last line in this article:  Isn&rsquo;t that what ICE is doing with these raids?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to get to the bottom of anything, as she said earlier in the article.  It&rsquo;s called enforcing the law.</p>

			<p>Obama and the Congress just had the opportunity to add E-Verify to the stimulous bill and chose to take it out of the bill.  If we had E-Verify we would not need to do work place raids so often.  </p>

			<p>Janet Napolitano and the Obama administration seem to be saying that you don&rsquo;t have to obey laws.  Everyone knows that it is against the law to sneak into the USA (that&rsquo;s why they call them illegal aliens). Likewise everyone knows that it is against the law to take a job in the USA if you are illegal.  It is also against the law to hire illegal undocumented aliens, to use fraudulent documentation, and to lie on job applications.  None of this matters to Napolitano or Obama.  Our government is sending a very clear message   &mdash;   it is OK to break the law if it is for your personal economic gain (i.e., it is OK to enter the USA illegally to make more money, obtain a job illegally, lie about income for a mortgage, etc.).  Of course we at AMRen disagree with the USA government. We feel that laws should always be obeyed. However, Obama is playing a very dangerous game, because some might reason that what is good for the goose is good for the gander.   </p>

<p>Laughing out loud, in utter abject disgust!</p>
<p>If The National Council of La Raza and this other internal terrorist group, The National Immigration Forum, think that the invaders and parasites they champion are being treated unfairly, they might just think again. Comrade BO, and El Presidente Bush before him, have not done nearly enough in dealing with the plague that is so fashionably called these days, &#8220;undocumented migrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>These raids and deportations are far too kind for these alien invaders or their supporters!</p>
<p>End of story!!!</p>

			<p>They imported the votes.  They paid their way here.  Gave them food, medical care, and shelter on the backs of earners, and received their support.  </p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s going to act like he still needs them in an effort to shut up the groups that supported him throughout the election because of empty promises.  It&rsquo;s not like those groups are going to run to the other side because he didn&rsquo;t hold up his end of the deal.  It&rsquo;s a win/win.</p>
<p>Nothing to it.</p>
<p>I am curious to see who he&rsquo;s going to blame for shipping them back now that he has no use for them.  Probably the one upcoming appointment to the Cabinet that doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much sense.</p>

			<p>     Napolitano couldn&rsquo;t keep illegals out of Arizona when she was governor there. She turned a blind eye to the whole affair. So what happens ? Obama makes her the head of Homeland Security. The Earth is the insane asylum for the rest of the universe.</p>

			<p>We spent a trillion dollars to blow up Iraquis, Afghans and to hunt down one Arab nut living in a cave in Pakistan, but we kowtow and even empower groups far more dangerous to the continuity of our civilization.  Don&rsquo;t pin the blame on Obama.  He&rsquo;s new to the party.  Clinton, Bush, and even Reagan could never get a handle on the problem, and the Gingrich led republican congress was a fraud from day one.</p>

			<p>The more stupidity that comes out of this guys mouth and office the more I&rsquo;m thinking Chuch Baldwin 2012. We need to rid America of the Dems and Repubs because they no longer serve the people. We need to jump on two different parties all together. Why isnt this being stated everywhere, we need a new party altogther.</p>
<p>Obama and the Congress just had the opportunity to add E-Verify to the stimulous bill and chose to take it out of the bill. If we had E-Verify we would not need to do work place raids so often. <br>
Posted by hugo at 5:57 PM on February 27 </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because their idiots plain and simple. Obama has illegals in his family living in America and by not ratifing E-Verify they can work here illegally. He will legalize them along millions of others that will try to take back the U.S. southwest. I VOTED FOR AN IDIOT WHO WAS THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS. But if we use that analongy there will always be evil in the world.</p>

			<p>Continual immigration from the Third World will secure a Democratic regime for many years to come.  Both parties are to blame for this mess. The Republicans easily could have reversed course during the Reagan and Bush (Senior and Junior) years.  But these Republicans adhered mindlessly to a laissez-faire, free-markets, open borders economic dogma where the only thing that mattered was the cheapest labor at all other costs.  They also deluded themselves into believing that hispanics would vote Republican.  What a joke.  The Democrats, for all their flaws, know the truth on this score: the more brown and black the population is, the more Democrat it is, and immigration from the Third World can only help them maintain power.  It&rsquo;s just a numbers game, and we have crossed the Rubicon.</p>

<p>When I was working in Kuwait in DS/GS doing Hummvee refurbs, we wouold often have to change 5 engines to get a good one that would run. These &#8220;rebuilt&#8221; engines were being built in the U.S. and now I suspect why that was happening to us. Our troop&rsquo;s lives depended on those engines.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a candid snapshot of our new government:</p>
<p>&#8220;Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano vow[ed] to Congress that she would &ldquo;get to the bottom of [a legal raid on illegals]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our new Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apparently seems determined to not enforce the law. (tisk, tisk, so soon after swearing an oath to do the opposite.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a fixture of our conversations and demands with him during the campaign. It has always been one that there would be a hold on the raids or a stop to the raids until [studied]&rdquo; said Cynthia Buiza, director at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, even President Obama has previously agreed not to enforce the law. (he too has already forgotten his Inaugural oath).</p>
<p>The new age has arrived.  </p>

			<p>When times get &#8220;tough&#8221; and complex challenges arise, Whites always manage to solve world problems and move forward.</p>
<p>Conversely, Blacks wallow in self-pity and are always reduced to crying to Whites for relief and help. Of course, the Blacks who are not wallowing in self-pity are committing violent homocides, rapes, and numerous other felonies against Whites.</p>
<p>The Black man&rsquo;s global dependence on the White man is one of the many hallmarks of their race. That includes the Blacks appointed to affirmative-action positions.</p>
<p>They are truly a race in the permanent custodial care of Whites. Every metric in existence, and words of the illegal alien Kenyan, verifies the truth.</p>
<p>Their ineptitude, propensity for violence, incompetence, untrustworthiness, irresponsibility, and lack of self-control is why it is a very bad idea to loan them money or trust them with important matters. Those hard facts illustrate why Detroit cannot have a Wal-mart or a national-chain grocery store, Harlem must have a prison watch-guard tower in the center of town, and U.S. equities are down 50 percent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to become much, much worse.</p>
<p>Once again, the facts.<br>

			<p>gee vee, at 7:32PM on February 27 says, </p>
<p>&#8220;Napolitano coundn&rsquo;t keep illegal aliens out of Arizona when she was Governor there. </p>
<p>&#8220;So what happens Obama makes her Secretary of Homeland Security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee vee, it is NOT because Napolitano COULDN&rsquo;T keep illegal aliens out of Arizona when she was governor there, that Obama made here Secretary of Homeland Security. It is BECAUSE Janet Napolitano DID NOT WANT TO keep illegal aliens out of Arizona that Obama gave her the top position for guarding the borders. NOT WANTING TO keep illegal aliens out of Arizona, was, so to speak, Napolitanos resume for the job of Secretary of Homeland Security for the new administration of &#8220;change&#8221;. Janet is the right person for the right job that the Administration of &#8220;change&#8221; wants.</p>

			<p>Janet&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.when you raid the place, you expose both the illegals and the illegal hiring acts by the employer. This is what is commonly referred to as a &#8216;twofur&rsquo;, a double whammy. One automatically gets the other there, Janet. I know you&rsquo;re a democrat but, are you really that stupid?

<p>Janet La Raza will never stop supporting wide open borders and millions upon millions of illegal aliens, and did you know that she has a twin sister?  Yikes!  There&rsquo;s two of them.  </p>
<p>Anyway, Janet&rsquo;s twin sister, Mary, just happens to be a judge in Arizona and is currently about to preside over a lawsuit by - You guessed it - Illegal aliens and their supporters versus Sheriff Joe for &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;  Of course, Joe&rsquo;s attorneys are trying to oust her before this ridiculous trial even begins as this woman clearly represents a &#8220;conflict of interest.&#8221; </p>
