<h1><a href="https://news.msu.edu/story/5910/">MSU Study Finds High Level of Medical Mistrust Among Minority Women Impacts Quality of Health Care</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 70 percent of minority women agree that health-care organizations sometimes deceive or mislead patients, one of the key findings of a Michigan State University study that researchers say can prevent women from getting breast cancer screenings.</p>
<p>The study of 341 Arab-American, African-American and Latina women was created to examine levels of medical mistrust and assess the impact on whether the participants received recommended breast cancer screenings, said Karen Patricia Williams, lead author and an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology in MSU&rsquo;s College of Human Medicine.</p>
<p>Williams presented her work at the American Association for Cancer Research&rsquo;s conference on the Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved, which was held Feb 3 to Feb. 6 in Arizona. The study was funded by Susan G. Komen for the Cure in Dallas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study reveals an important association between medical mistrust and appropriately timed breast cancer screening among many minority women,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;We found high levels of mistrust, regardless of the racial-ethnic group. People are less likely to engage in preventive screening practices, thereby making them more likely to suffer from conditions such as breast cancer that if caught early could be better treated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams added the findings also show many minority women only will use the health-care system when they are very sick, a medical behavior that taxes the health-care system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among other findings:</p>
<p>*&nbsp;African-American women were found to have higher levels of mistrust; 39 percent strongly agreed that health-care organizations don&rsquo;t keep information private, compared to 15 percent for Latina women and 9 percent for Arab-American women.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;44 percent of women who had never received a clinical breast exam agreed that health-care organizations have sometimes done harmful experiments on patients without their knowledge.</p>

			<p>Gee, I wonder why they have this mistrust.  It&rsquo;s precisely because liberal paranoia about &#8220;health care disparities&#8221; turns into a game of telephone among blacks that the health care system is out to get them.  Thereby decreasing the rates of blacks that seek health care, thereby increasing the health care disparities.</p>

<p>* Blacks get checked for breast cancer less often than their white counterparts.<br>
* Therefore more likely to suffer from worsened breast cancer, that could be treated better if caught early<br>
* <i>As the average black is unable or unwilling to believe that disproportionate rates of disease or crime affecting blacks may be due to the black community, <b>not</b> &#8220;evil whites&#8221;</i>: Therefore black &#8220;community leaders&#8221;, rumours, gossip spread the belief that &#8220;racist white doctors&#8221; are attempting to &#8220;kill off black females&#8221; - either by &#8220;secret techniques&#8221; or refusing to tell the patient they have an early form of breast cancer.<br>
* Therefore black females get checked for breast cancer less often than their white counterparts.</p>

<p>I always view statistics derived from questions posed to minorites with a justifiable degree of skeptisism.</p>
<p>Based on my experiences and anecdotal observations of the world around me, I seriously doubt that minority women put that much thought into any complex question. The underlying premise of the question was, &#8220;Do you believe you are a victim?&#8221; Of course, most answered &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>One could substitute the &#8220;health-care quality&#8221; question with, &#8220;Have you been a victim of racism in the last five hours,&#8221; and probably receive a similar percentile response. If the question were changed to, &#8220;Have you been a victim of racism in the last week,&#8221; the number would likely grow to over 95 percent.</p>

<p>If the so-called &#8220;study&#8221; would have asked questions regarding trust on other matters, they would have probably found that this same group of malcontents whine and complain about everything, because they&rsquo;ve got an inability to accurately evaluate anything and anybody and prefer to think the worst of everything, because they&rsquo;re losers or they wouldn&rsquo;t be here if they were not.</p>
<p>We get the worst of the world&rsquo;s population.  The crime and poverty, less intelligent elements.  So disgusting.</p>

			<p>Oh sure, there is huge conspiracy amongst the medical community to put the mojo on sistas to keep em down.  Just another way they find excuses for why they fail to seek medical care. </p>
<p>The real problem is most blacks don&rsquo;t emphasize health care, and probably for several reasons.  Maintaining one&rsquo;s health requires personal responsibilty, along with consistent positive behaviors (such as eating right, watching one&rsquo;s weight, taking vitamins and/or medications), and having the foresight to address bad habits or health conditions before they cause real damage. Many prefer to live for the moment and cannot fathom the relationship between current behavior and future quality of life.  Instead of acknowledging this, once again the white establishment is to blame.</p>

			<p>Who cares? What is WRONG with any particular group living and DIEING by their beliefs? Is it the job of others to help you make &#8220;better&#8221; decisions for your own longevity? I think not. That&rsquo;s what wrong with all these studies that show that you aren&rsquo;t making the &#8220;proper&#8221; decision and therefore someone i.e government ought to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money in order to make you &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221; The Internet is availible to practically everyone with access to a public library; the information to make &#8220;proper&#8221; health choices is therefore availible to EVERYONE including &#8220;minority women.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Why was there no data on &#8220;levels of mistrust&#8221; among men and non-minority women for comparison?</p>
<p>With all the Affirmative action beauties populating medicine, my main concern is their incompetence and indifference. Limited English proficiency among the imported types is also a problem.</p>

			<p>As an RN I can attest to some of this. More than once I&rsquo;ve had black women refuse to have me as a care provider with no prior contact history. And I&rsquo;ve seen a middle aged black woman literally shake with fear as I was taking her vital signs. I&rsquo;m thinking it takes a lifetime of immersion in a negative cultural envirinment to be that mislead/stupid.<br>
 Black men dont seem to have this problem although the younger ones sometimes try to turn caregivers into servants and cry racisim when we don&rsquo;t play along.<br>
