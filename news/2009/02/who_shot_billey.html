			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Robinson and Dan Wetzel, Yahoo! Sports, February 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Piles of recruiting letters litter the back seat, the remnants of life as one of the most sought-after running backs in the Class of 2010. Alabama wanted Billey Joe [Johnson]. So did Notre Dame. And dozens of other schools. He was ready to commit to Auburn. By many accounts Billey Joe was a popular, big-dreaming, clean-living kid. So it&rsquo;s no wonder his father stands in the yard next to a single-wide trailer, trying to play forensic expert. Searching  &mdash;  like many in this rural community  &mdash;  for answers about who shot his son.</p>
<p>Local authorities stopped Billey Joe for a traffic violation on the morning of Dec. 8, and they say the truck is simply the site of a terrible tragedy. But to the elder Johnson, it&rsquo;s a crime scene.</p>
<p>Nearly two months later, only one fact is certain: Instead of running out of George County as a football hero, Billey Joe was buried beneath it at the age of 17.</p>
<p>The George County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department claims that on that fateful morning, Billey Joe attempted to break into the home of an on-again, off-again girlfriend in the nearby city of Lucedale. According to the sheriff&rsquo;s department, he left the scene and ran a red light at 5:34 a.m. After a 11⁄2-mile pursuit, Billey Joe got out of his truck, met sheriff&rsquo;s deputy Joe Sullivan and handed over his license. Then Billey Joe returned to his truck, put a 12-gauge shotgun he used to target deer to his head and committed suicide. It was 5:40 a.m.</p>
<p>Sullivan&rsquo;s patrol car was not equipped with a camera, and his is the only account of the event. Billey Joe&rsquo;s friends and family don&rsquo;t believe the story.</p>
<p>Billey Joe was black. Sullivan is white. The case, as such, is shrouded by race in this small community in the Deep South. Everyone wants answers. No one is getting them. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations and the local district attorney  &mdash;  the two bodies in charge of the case  &mdash;  have issued neither a ruling nor many pertinent details.</p>
<p>Tony Lawrence, the district attorney running the state&rsquo;s investigation, met with the family Dec. 19 and urged patience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson fixates on the truck that is stained with what is left of his son. The day after the incident, police returned it to the family as is. Rather than wash it, junk it or sell it, Johnson keeps it in a garage, driving it out to re-examine. He stares at it. He imagines his son.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s convinced someone forced Billey Joe on his knees, shoved the shotgun barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must&rsquo;ve tortured my baby,&#8221; Johnson says.</p>
<p>Here is what the police say about Billey Joe&rsquo;s death: During a routine traffic stop, Billey Joe Johnson Jr. shot himself in the head.</p>
<p>He woke at 4:30 a.m. that day, a school day, at his parents&rsquo; trailer and took a shower. His dad thought he was going hunting. Instead, he drove 15 miles to Lucedale, the 2,700-person county seat and location of both his high school and a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Billey Joe&rsquo;s truck had notes from multiple female admirers, and his friends said he enjoyed the attention offered to a star athlete. He&rsquo;d already run for 4,000 yards in his high school career and helped make George County a state powerhouse. Everyone knew him. Many wanted to be with him.</p>
<p>One girl, whom Yahoo! Sports will not name since she is a minor, had been around the longest. It was a typical high school relationship  &mdash;  &#8220;they&rsquo;d break up every day and then get back together,&#8221; said one of his friends, Drew Bradley. The fact that she was white bothered some people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s George County, it&rsquo;s a little Southern town,&#8221; said Bradley, who is white. &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got a bunch of racist people down here. You have people who hated on them because it was black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was about the only unsettled part of his life. His friends swear he never drank or did drugs, a claim backed by a toxicology report that also found no trace of steroids. If anything, his biggest vices were hunting, playing video games and occasionally driving a little too fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;The photos on his cellphone contained one picture of a girl and after that it was deer, deer, deer,&#8221; said Jerome Carter, the Johnson family&rsquo;s attorney and a managing partner in the Mobile, Ala., branch of the Johnnie Cochran Law Firm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even as new girlfriends came on the scene, the old one would return. There were rumors of a restraining order but no paperwork indicating such a filing was present in county court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to an incident report filed by the Lucedale city police, the girl claimed Billey Joe tried to break in through the front door and later tapped her bedroom window before leaving.</p>
<p>As Billey Joe drove away, the girl called her mother, who in turn called police and said they wanted to &#8220;sign charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unknown whether Billey Joe knew about the call to the cops or what his state of mind was at that point. The girl&rsquo;s family has declined comment and has refused to speak to Johnson family investigators, according to Carter. It&rsquo;s a key mystery in the case and the center of much of the gossip.</p>
<p>After leaving the trailer, Billey Joe ran a red light as he headed in the direction of home. Deputy Sullivan observed it and turned on his blue lights in pursuit. A little more than a half-mile down the road, Johnson ran a four-way stop sign. Slightly less than a mile after that, he finally pulled into a driveway that serviced a few shops, including Benndale Carpet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is only one other official eyewitness account of the crime scene, an incident report written by Lucedale police Sgt. James O&rsquo;Neal, who initially responded to the girl&rsquo;s home and then went to the site of the shooting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I approached the scene and observed a black male, identified as the suspect Billey Joe Johnson, lying on the ground outside the driver&rsquo;s side door with a shotgun lying on top of him and blood on the ground around his head,&#8221; O&rsquo;Neal wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here is what family and friends say about Billey Joe&rsquo;s death: Billey Joe Johnson was shot in the head by someone else.</p>
<p>They start with his personality. He was calm, never violent, happy and hopeful. Last fall, he&rsquo;d begun attending the First Baptist Church with friends and &#8220;gave his life to Christ,&#8221; according to his youth pastor, Rob Hilbun.</p>
<p>He had more friends than he could count  &mdash;  &#8220;that boy would be text-messaging in his sleep,&#8221; said his mother, Annette. His funeral was held in the biggest room in the county  &mdash;  the middle school gym  &mdash;  yet it struggled to contain the estimated 1,000 mourners.</p>
<p>Just a junior, he was fielding letters and recruiting pitches from college coaches Charlie Weis and Les Miles and taking visits to Alabama and Mississippi State. They saw him as the second coming of Walter Payton, a small-town Mississippi legend from not too far down the road.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s attorney, Jerome Carter, disputes the allegation that Billey Joe attempted to break into the former girlfriend&rsquo;s trailer. He notes that there was no evidence of forced entry presented by police, and the powerful 6-foot, 205-pound Billey Joe easily could have gained forceful entry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Billey Joe had told friends he&rsquo;d been pulled over by police dozens of times, including at least 18 times by one officer  &mdash;  not Sullivan. Friends admit he liked to drive fast on the country roads, so it&rsquo;s possible those incidents were reasonable and police were actually cutting him a break by letting him off. Others think police routinely targeted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said it seemed like the police were all the time hating on him,&#8221; said friend Drew Bradley.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Billey Joe Johnson Sr. remains convinced that his son was murdered by someone, although he doesn&rsquo;t know whom.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inside Billey Joe&rsquo;s blood-spattered truck, amidst the recruiting letters from famous coaches and female classmates, near the ammo boxes and the pictures of wildlife, sat a copy of the Emily Dickinson poem &#8220;The Chariot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lying eerily amongst the remains of a violent end to a promising life, the opening lines still call out:</p>
<p>Because I could not stop for Death,</p>
<p>He kindly stopped for me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>

			<p>In Concord, CA, back in the 1980s, there was a a black who hung himself on BART property.A bunch of blacks and their white liberal sympathizers tried to blame this on some white rednecks who stabbed a black nonfatally a few weeks earlier.It turned out that the black who hung himself was suicidal,and gay.Years afterward, there was a vigil about this incident by the same white liberals, trying to blame Whitey for it.</p>

A few years back, there was a big surge in blacks being killed here in Buffalo with very few arrests. At first the black community complained it was because white people (cops and law enforcement) didn&rsquo;t care about blacks. Then they started a rumor that maybe there was a white serial killer targeting blacks. This was of course absurd because there was no patten such as was found with the Beltway Sniper case:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltway_sniper_attacks" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltway_sniper_attacks</a></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;He said it seemed like the police were all the time hating on him,&rdquo; said friend Drew Bradley.</i></p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t &#8216;hating on him&rsquo;. They were stopping someone breaking the law. If he often liked to speed, it&rsquo;s reasonable to believe he would get stopped more often.</p>
<p>Likewise, I want people to try this experiment when they&rsquo;re driving at night. When coming up on a car from behind, see if you can identify the driver by race. It&rsquo;s likely you can&rsquo;t make out the race of the driver but you can determine if they&rsquo;re speeding. The police go after speeding cars, not drivers who are black.</p>
<p>The fact that he had everything going for him is not proof that he was in a sound state of mind at that moment. It&rsquo;s just as likely that he recognized what he&rsquo;d done was over the top and it&rsquo;s reasonable to believe he saw his life coming to a crashing stop. The poem &ldquo;The Chariot&#8221; may also point to his state of mind. The crumpled and unopened recruiting letters is also odd for someone who was relishing in his achievements.</p>
<p>I read the timeline on the original post which sounds very straightforward. I also searched the text for the &#8216;finger&rsquo;, &#8216;prints&rsquo; and &#8216;DNA&rsquo; separately but I didn&rsquo;t get any hits. Did Officer Sullivan have blood and flesh splattered on his uniform consistent with a close-range shooting?  </p>
<p>Was the gun ever tested for prints? Did they find any other prints besides Billeys on the gun? Was the gun found to be wiped clean? Was any DNA evidence from any other person found on the gun? None of this is stated.</p>
<p>If the police were doing their job properly, the gun should hold the answer to whether he shot himself or it was the work of a rouge cop. The details about physical evidence found on the gun or if the office had any blood splatter on his uniform are not reported.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know more and I&rsquo;m willing to listen to all the evidence.</p>

			<p>Well, unless they have some sort of proof that he was murderd, they shouldn&rsquo;t go accusing. People, even seemingly joyous people, just snap sometimes. But if it&rsquo;s true he was murdered, I hope justice is served. And that&rsquo;s all that needs to be said.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Without evidence, black family insinuates son was murdered by white cop.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is so unusual about this?  I mean, everytime a black thief or killer gets shot or arrested or subdued he is a victim and blacks are screaming racism before he hits the ground.</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>

			<p>Johnson probably reached for the gun, was trying to get set up to shoot the officer and ended up blowing his own brains out by accident. End of story. </p>

			<p>This incident happened quite close to where I live.  You really have to think quite deeply about this  &mdash;  if this cop were really intent on &#8220;murdering&#8221; this &#8220;youth,&#8221; the scene would have played out quite differently.  Being that there was no camera in the car, the deputy would have told the &#8220;youth&#8221; to run, then shot him, then placed a stolen handgun in the &#8220;youth&rsquo;s&#8221; hand (we all know that crooked white cops all carry &#8220;untraceable&#8221; handguns on their person to plant on innocent black suspects).  I&rsquo;d bet that what happened was that the &#8220;youth&#8221; was pulling the shotgun out of the back seat to aim at the deputy, and being an idiot and unfamiliar with actually using a weapon (i.e. seeing blacks on film shooting handguns sideways) tripped and shot himself.</p>

			<p> I didn&rsquo;t have to read very far into this story to be utterly convinced that Charles Robinson and Dan Wetzel are typical of many White reporters I worked with in 39 and one-half years as a newspaperman.</p>
<p> That is to say, they go into any investigative journalism story involving race firmly convinced that blacks get the dirty end of the stick, always and everywhere; that all southern Whites are savage, black-hating racists; and that southern White police officers, in particular, will casually and deliberately murder black people any time they think they can get away with it.</p>
<p> And note how they describe the deceased football star   &mdash;   why, to hear the people they choose to quote tell it, he was the Second Coming personified; Jesus Christ with a deep tan. Jeez, what a wonderful, marvelous, Simon-pure young man! The girls just fell all over themselves to go out with him! And (of course) there were many insecure, inadequate White police officers who hated him for that! So, naturally, one of them must have taken advantage of a situation to murder him in cold blood!</p>
<p> That&rsquo;s the picture this Yahoo Sports story paints for us, not because Mr. Robinson and Mr. Wetzel followed where the evidence led them and concluded that this must be what happened; but because they WANT it to be what happened. It would confirm all their cherished prejudices so neatly! </p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s impossible to ID <i>anyone</i> in another vehicle at night, whether from behind or ahead. It&rsquo;s occasionally possible to ID vehicle occupants from the side   &mdash;   <i>if</i> the windows are down or aren&rsquo;t tinted and <i>if</i> there&rsquo;s a bright street light at the intersection.</p>
<p>sbuffalonative  also asked: <i>Did Officer Sullivan have blood and flesh splattered on his uniform consistent with a close-range shooting?</i></p>
<p>Another question: Did he have any GSR (gunshot residue) on his uniform or hands? If the answer to either question is &#8220;no,&#8221; then he could not have been the shooter. Of course, that only applies to the real world we whites live in. But in the fantasyland that all too many blacks inhabit, white cops can magically see into darkened cars at night and can magically cause physical evidence to vanish without a trace.</p>

<p>Does this mean he stopped, or was not, banging all those White girls?  A lot of holes in this story, and not from the cop&rsquo;s end.<br>

<p>Just like there was no evidence he was murdered. Talk about selective delusion. Some people cannot accept anything that does not go their way and will trash anyone to try to make the evidence conform to their warped vision of reality. The picture painted of Billey Joe was perfect, so you know there was skeleton or hidden side that had reared itself. The cop should have had a videocam to cover his butt. In this day and age, he could get convicted for inuendo.</p>

			<p>Perhaps I have watched too many crime documentaries, but wouldn&rsquo;t a fairly routine forsensic investigation make it relatively clear whether this was a suicide or not? Surely such an investigation is SOP for any Police dept. these days. I should hope the family&rsquo;s spurious claims would be fairly easy to dispute.</p>

			<p>Same tune, different verse! It is ALWAYS a White cop shooting a poor &#8216;innocent&rsquo; Black. Hey, I mean seriously, why bother we proof? We all know instinctively Whites will murder Blacks, given the slightest opportunity. </p>
<p>Finger prints on the shotgun? reasonable cause on the part of the officer to SHOOT the Black victim with his own gun. Don&rsquo;t bother me wif faks, man, I KNOW whut hoppen! Now about those many thousands of REAL race crime&hellip; those Black-on-White race crimes&hellip; note the sudden silence!</p>

			<p>Anyone who looks at this case can see the foul play on the police dept. You People kill me with this mess, as if racism does&rsquo;nt exist anymore. They knew their child and knew that he loved life to the fullest. He had no reason in this world to kill himself, and the truth will come out. If if does&rsquo;nt come out on earth, it will on judgement day. The fact that they did&rsquo;nt have much money has nothing to do with the death of their son. I&rsquo;m reading some of the comments that you closed minded WHITE PEOPLE wrote and it makes me sick to my stomach. Get your facts straight before you go assuming. If the police dept had nothing to hide, why did&rsquo;nt they hand over the officers uniform? That right there shows they had something to hide.  Like I said get your facts straight before you go making ignorant comments. </p>

<p>Thats fowl, these people lost their kid. Their human beings so you should respect them even though they are foolish. I lost a family member recently and I can feel their pain. Just because their black doesn&rsquo;t give them you the right to disrespect them, that&rsquo;s not what this website is about.</p>

			<p>HERE ARE THE FACTS SO FAR:</p>
<p>From the beginning, the District Attorney has treated the investigation of Billey Joe&rsquo;s death as a suicide or the result of an accidental self-inflicted injury. Based on his public statements and interactions with Billey Joe&rsquo;s family, it appears that the District Attorney hasn&rsquo;t looked into whether Billey Joe was killed by an officer or someone else. Again, we don&rsquo;t have all the answers, but here&rsquo;s what we do know: </p>
<p>Billey Joe was at his former girlfriend&rsquo;s house minutes before the killing.2 He never entered the house, but police were called to respond to an attempted burglary there.3 This fact was not a part of the original story given by the police. <br>
 </p>
<p>Billey Joe&rsquo;s family says that his ex-girlfriend had been staying at her father&rsquo;s house because her mother threw her out for dating Billey Joe (she is White and Billey Joe was Black). They said Billey Joe knew to only go to the house when the girl&rsquo;s father was not present, that the two of them were on good terms even after he had broken up with her, and that the breakup was largely because of pressure from her father. The family also claims that there is a relationship between the officer present at the scene of Billey Joe&rsquo;s death and the girl&rsquo;s father. <br>
 <br>
A witness heard two shots, not one, at the scene where Billey Joe died, according to an independent investigation launched by the Mississippi NAACP. The pathologist in that investigation has indicated that it would be impossible for a bullet from a self-inflicted shot to enter in the manner that it did. He also said that given the length of Billey Joe&rsquo;s arms and the length of the shotgun, it would have been impossible for him to hold the weapon and fire it at himself. <br>
 <br>
Billey Joe was a star athlete with scholarship offers from more than half a dozen schools. No one  &mdash;  including family, friends, and coaches  &mdash;  could think of a reason that Billey Joe would want to end his life.4,5,6 <br>
A true investigation would sort out fact from rumor. But we can&rsquo;t be sure that Johnson&rsquo;s family will get the investigation it deserves. In the case of the Jena 6 we saw a District Attorney and a judge incapable of carrying out justice in a racially charged environment. In the recent case of the murder of Oscar Grant by police (and many like it), we see how unlikely it is for District Attorneys to do their job when the suspect is an officer of the law. But in both these cases, public pressure has made all the difference by shining a spotlight on local authorities. </p>
<p>In the case of Billey Joe Johnson, we&rsquo;re looking for the truth and for justice. A minute of your time can help ensure his family gets both: </p>

<p>It sounds like we white people need our own &#8220;Anti-Defamation League&#8221;, to protect our people against these kinds of slanderous and defamatory group charges.</p>
<p>I suspect I&rsquo;m not the only one who&rsquo;s sick of white people being blamed for every random tragedy, while blacks continue to victimize whites at record numbers.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the laws in Alabama where this took place, but in many more populous areas of the country, such as the entire state of New Jersey, &#8220;shotgun only&#8221; deer hunting is all you CAN DO legally - although slugs are required. </p>

to white floridian and denise:</p>
<p>I wrote in my post that I was willing to hear all the evidence but this article seems to be selective in their details. There are simple questions to be asked and investigated none of which the authors bring up. However, this article only repeats the claim Billey was a good kid with a promising future. </p>
<p>If there is a conspiracy and cover up by the police, the forensic evidence should be straightforward and the authors should be asking relevant questions, not repeating the &#8216;good kid&rsquo; angle. For example, most shotguns are about the same size so it would be fairly simple to take any shotgun and see if it&rsquo;s possible to shoot yourself in the manner described. This is a simple premise to test the authors could have performed. </p>
<p>We can only go by what this article is telling us. You two say there&rsquo;s more to the story than reported here. If you have any other sources of information on this case, please post them or send them to my email. As I said before, I&rsquo;m willing to hear all the evidence. Unfortunately, if there is more to this story that points to the guilt of the police, these authors were negligent in their reporting. Did anyone, police officers, emergency personnel, hospital workers, investigators see any blood splattering on the police officer consistent with a close range shooting? There must have been a sizable number of people watching the events and questioning the officer. Not all of them would have been loyal to a police cover up. </p>
<p>The article claims that there was an incident that happened before the shooting that caused the girlfriend to want to file a complaint. Even if the two were on good term, something happened between them that night that shook up this girl. If they were on good terms before he arrived, he didn&rsquo;t leave on good terms. Again, there are many questions the authors didn&rsquo;t ask or investigate. </p>
<p>I have an open mind and I want to hear all the evidence and hear people asking good and investigating claims. Speculation is not evidence.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for blacks to claim an &#8216;unexplained&rsquo; death of a black person was the result of whites. Making the claim and having the evidence are two different things.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a famous case of a black teen who committed suicide which made national headlines on the assumption that it was a lynching by whites:</p>

<p>PS: To my fellow AR posters: I don&rsquo;t believe posting rude and crude comments helps our cause in any way. Please consider what you post carefully.</p>

			<p>Ok - for all you White people taking this out of context:  WE(Black people &amp; liberal whites) do not ALWAYS blame Whites for always killing blacks without probable cause.  If you look at the FACTS ONLY (and not your personal opinions/views), suicide does not make any sense.  Why would Billey Joe be talking about the future with such anticipation only days/weeks prior to this alleged suicide?  Why would he take a shower that morning before he decided to kill himself &#8220;on a whim&#8221;?  I believe higher level law enforcement needs to intervene.  There was only ONE person - the officer, who was an &#8220;eyewitness&#8221; to what happened.  He did NOT have a dashboard camera.  Why wasn&rsquo;t there a dashboard camera?  Where was the father of the girl he allegedly visited when this apparent suicide transpired?  The suicide theory is not  plausible to me unless they interview family members and friends to find out if Billey Joe displayed ANY of the warning signs of suicide.  Was he ever depressed?  Did he have MH problems?  Lots of questions needing lots of solid answers.  May JUSTICE be served and the TRUTH prevail - in Jesus&rsquo; Name.</p>

<p>Thats sick these people are human they have feelings to. Some people on this website take things too far and then wonder why the movement is not taking off. Anyone who reads the comments on this website would think that this is just another chest pounding website, where people rant and rave about minorties and their problems.</p>
<p>Your country is being overrun by illegals because whites were to lazy to protect the borders and illegals are being hired because whites are corrupt (hire for cheap labor). Whites cause a war that is very suspect and are responsible for our low approval rating around the world (not blacks). How many of you campaigned for McCain, Bladwin, or the end to illegal immigration. Look at the problems and give resonable answers to them that&rsquo;s what this website is for.</p>

<p> Are you a psychiatrist? How much training have you had as a mental-health professional. Suicidal people often seem very happy, calm, composed or &#8220;up&#8221; shortly before they take the plunge. Many of them are manic-depressive.</p>

<p>Go look into the actions of impending muslim suicide bombers, they clean, shave, put on clean clothes and then go do the deed! I have personally seen several suicides (face to face!) and similar circumstances surrounded each, no apparent reason, upbeat mood and things in life to look forward to. There is no explaining why a person would commit suicide, and they can&rsquo;t be asked.</p>

<p>Different states, different laws. I believe shotgun hunting of deer (and anything/everything else) is legal here in South Carolina.</p>

<p>Irrelevant. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Bias" rel="nofollow">Len Bias</a> signed a megabuck NBA contract, then coked himself to death less than 2 days later. While not the exclusive province of blacks, lack of impulse control and self-destructive acts are hallmarks of black behavior.</p>
<p>Those who saw the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_(film)" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Friday Night Lights&#8221;</a> will recall the all-black Dallas football team that won the state championship. Within a month or two of winning that title, several players went on a major crime spree. As one might expect, parents &amp; school administrators were quick to make excuses for the young thugs. For reasons unrelated to the crimes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Interscholastic_League" rel="nofollow">UIL</a> revoked the team&rsquo;s championship.</p>

			<p>White floridian posts a list of facts that aren&rsquo;t facts at all if you take 10 minutes to search the net for information. This kid was probably up to no good and most likely shot himself accidently because he didn&rsquo;t know how to properly the shotgun in his vehicle. The shotgun he was probably going to use on the police officer. He was causing some trouble at his ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s place and took off. Maybe he&rsquo;s a &#8220;victim&#8221;, maybe he was thinking about shooting the ex-girlfriend or her father or both. </p>

			<p>Many years ago, near our village a hunter shot himself accidentally with his shotgung while climbing over a 3 feet fence. Hunters are always told to unload their weapons before  they do something unusual like climbing a fence or storing the gun or the rifle in the back of their car, but they do not always follow that advice. That type of accident seems to be quite frequent. <br>
BTW, the distance between the muzzle and the trigger of a shotgun is about 28 inches.<br>
A particularly gruesome type of suicide with a shotgun is to place the muzzle into the mouth and to pull the trigger. A suicide of this type is described in French novelist Jean Ferdinand Celine&rsquo;s novel &#8220;Mort a Credit&#8221;.</p>
