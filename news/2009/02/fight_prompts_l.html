			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Los Angeles Times, February 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Los Angeles County juvenile probation camp for girls was locked down Friday after two youths and eight staff members were injured in a fight the night before.</p>
<p>The 35-minute fight started about 8:30 p.m. Thursday in a dorm at Camp Kenyon Scudder in Santa Clarita, said Kerri Webb, a Probation Department spokeswoman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camp Scudder is designated for girls with mental health needs and is located next to the county&rsquo;s only other camp for girls, Camp Joseph Scott. Camp Scudder housed 53 girls at the time of the fight, with a dozen staff on duty, Webb said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Webb [Kerri Webb, a Probation Department spokeswoman] said she could not confirm reports from Camp Scudder staff that Thursday&rsquo;s fight was racially motivated, although she said racial tensions at the camps &#8220;are very common, unfortunately.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A racially motivated attack at Camp Fred C. Miller in Malibu on Nov. 1 left an 18-year-old with two fused vertebrae in his neck, probation officials said. The victim, who is African American, was attacked by a group of Latino youths.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a camp manager sent an e-mail to probation supervisors warning of escalating racial tensions at other camps, including Afflerbaugh, Holton, Rockey and Munz. He noted that both Afflerbaugh and Holton had recently reported &#8220;multiple incidents of fights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please instruct your staff to remain vigilant and on the alert for racial tension among the minors; and be extra cautious with minors arriving to the facility from these camps,&#8221; the e-mail said.<br/>

			<p>When I was in high school many years ago, I overheard an asian student telling another how the blacks in &#8220;juvie&#8221; would beat on whiteboys whenever they got a chance. This just shows that the blacks, when given any REAL oportunity, meaning whenever they can get away with it,will always victimize whites any time they can. </p>

			<p>Notice it&rsquo;s blacks vs. Hispanics.</p>
<p>There was a story here in AR the other day, about how some Hispanic gripe group is griping about talk radio and Lou Dobbs.  They juxtapose that with hate crime statistics, where Hispanics were the victims.  I could have made a study, that proves that:  (1) Grass is green (2) Money is green (3) Money is associated with greed, so all grass farmers are greedy.  Get the picture?</p>
<p>Anyway, the study wanted you to think that all these white people were going out and beating up on Mexicans after having been inspired by subliminal messages from the Lou Dobbs hour, but the truth of the matter is that most hate crimes in California against Hispanics are committed by blacks, and vice-versa, though in that case a Hispanic offender would be counted as white.</p>

<p>What percentage are whites in this camp? I&rsquo;m curious, as blacks/Hispanics tend to group together in the minority - though the ethnic-based violence, and the fact that black/&#8221;mixed-race&#8221; individuals (not sure on the &#8220;Latinos&#8221;) suffer from more mental disorders on average than whites (attributable to racism though) has me thinking that whites form a minority:<br/>
What&rsquo;s even more curious is how much &#8220;Latino&#8221;/Black-on-white violence is probably going unreported&hellip;</p>

			<p>Are we to believe that hispanics are ganging up on the poor blacks?? If forced to make a choice, to paraphrase Obama &#8220;I will stand with the Mexicans&#8221;</p>

			<p> Yet another news media report on an incident involving &#8220;racial tensions,&#8221; which nevertheless is very careful not to be specific enough that you could hang your hat on anything it said. Except, of course, for the poor African American who was &#8220;attacked by a group of Hispanic youths.&#8221; Poor, poor blacks; everybody picks on them.</p>
<p> Wonder what caused the fight at Camp Kenyon Scudder, beyond the usual generic &#8220;racial tensions&#8221;? Wonder what race the two youths injured in that fight were? We&rsquo;ll never know by reading the L.A. Times, will we? Could someone be hiding something here that might &#8220;exacerbate racial stereotypes&#8221;?  </p>

			<p>Do not believe this report!  Diversity is Our Greatest Strength!  Diversity only makes things better.  Just look at how the economy of California is booming right now, because of the great Diversity.  Multiculturalism (the idea that the more different people are, the better they will get along) has been a fantastic benefit wherever it has been tried, such as in Kosovo, Northern Ireland, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Kurdistan, South Osettia, Palestine, Tibet, and now, thanks to massive Third World immigration   &mdash;   even California can enjoy the great benefits of Multiculturalism.   </p>

			<p>Here it is again.  Black/mestizo fighting, murders, and rioting, are becoming more numerous as time goes by.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beginning to look like author Tom Chittum was right when he maintained in his book, Civil War II, that ground zero for the beginning of festivities would occur in California.</p>
<p>The black/mestizo riots and murders will ignite a larger conflict as soon as these events pick up a bit more.  The cowardly white elites know this but are terrified to give anyone any warning for fear of being called racists.</p>

			<p>Santa Clarita itself is actually a very beautiful and prosperous community that is predominantly White. It&rsquo;s situated in it&rsquo;s own Valley outside of Los Angeles. The county brings the troubled black and Latin kids up to Santa Clarita and drops them off at the County detention camps, only to cause problems for the local residents when things like this happen. </p>

			<p>Does anyone else notice something here? The camp is located in Santa Clarita   &mdash;   a White part of LA County. The other one mentioned is in Malibu   &mdash;   another White part of LA County. </p>

Great post!</p>
<p>Yep. Once again, what we are dealing with are a group of pathological liars who simply can not stop lying.  As I have suggested before, we should hammer away at this from every possible angle - going into it from a position of Psychology, Philosophy, etc. and just put it out there, anywhere (well, obviously I mean cyberspace) and leave it at that.  <br/>
It is the only real non-violent way to do it.</p>
<p>Forget their logic, we need to expose and identify the sickness.  And that is the right word.  These people are sick, very, very sick.</p>

			<p>&#8220;she could not confirm reports from Camp Scudder staff that Thursday&rsquo;s fight was racially motivated&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, when a Black beats on a White, officials and the media will either:<br/>
1) Ignore it, and refuse to let the story see the light of day<br/>
-or-<br/>
2) Refuse to acknowledge that there is any possible anti-White racism on the part of the Black attacker.</p>
<p>The double-standard, which allows Black criminals to target Whites with impunity, is sickening indeed. </p>

			<p>Blacks versus Mexicans.  To quote Yogi Berra, &#8220;It&rsquo;s like deja vu all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps a method of managing inmates in juvenile detention camps would be to segregate them.  After all, they&rsquo;re sent to the camps in the first place for being troublemakers.  Giving them one less excuse to fight would certainly make them more manageable, and thus assist in the job of civilizing and educating them.  Oh, wait.  Segregating them would violate someone&rsquo;s &#8220;rights&#8221;.  My bad.  Never mind.</p>
