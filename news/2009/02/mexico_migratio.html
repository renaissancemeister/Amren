<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29289181/">Mexico Migration Falls by More Than Half</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Net migration from Mexico, mainly to the United States, plunged by more than 50 percent in late 2008 compared to a year earlier as fewer Mexicans left their country in search of work, the government said Thursday.</p>
<p>Mexican officials attributed the sharp drop to tough economic conditions abroad amid a global crisis causing Mexicans to stay at home, rather than Mexicans in other countries returning to their homeland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the number of returning Mexicans stayed largely the same  &mdash;  478,000 in the 2007 period as compared to about 450,000 by late 2008  &mdash;  the number leaving fell from 933,000 to 654,000.</p>
<p>The figures are estimates based on quarterly surveys of Mexican households carried out by the institute.</p>
<p><b>Remittances plunge</b></p>
<p>Sojo [Eduardo Sojo, president of Mexico&rsquo;s National Statistics, Geography and Information Institute.] said a recent survey also indicates that the number of Mexicans planning to migrate in the future is also dropping.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a sort of &#8216;leading indicator&rsquo; regarding any new migration. This indicator has also been declining,&#8221; Sojo told an immigration forum.</p>
<p>Sojo said a government survey also shows the number of households in Mexico that receive remittances  &mdash;  the money sent home by Mexicans working abroad  &mdash;  has also fallen, from 1.41 million in 2005 to 1.16 million in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration is believed to have played a role in reducing the number of Mexicans who look for work abroad, almost all in the United States. {snip}<br/>

			<p>FYI, In Houston Texas (I live Here),an illegal mexican gang member drug dealer, deported 4 previous times, was caught again,but get this,he was in a church, the off duty officer tapped him on the shoulder and asked him to step outside, then arrested him.NOW, the officer is being sued by him and MALDEF!This was reported 2-20-2009.On 2-19-2009, they pictured his Mother in the city and state section, holding his photograph and weeping with a sad story as usual.When is this madness going to stop? God Help us all.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether to believe this report or not, because the mestizos we get coming into the country are too dense to understand that there might be less work now.</p>
<p>But I DO know that Obama said yesterday that he&rsquo;s committed to writing an immigration reform bill, and they&rsquo;re in the process of doing that right now.  And that, of course will be the amnesty bill only it will be far more outrageous than the first one, and this time it will pass.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just short of amazing that this pro-black fool is putting priorities on a pro-black spending bill and giving 30 million aliens amnesty over trying to help the economy.  </p>
<p>Both propositions are weakening the economy, and will lead to a faster decline.  It&rsquo;s as if his intent has been to destroy the country all along.</p>
<p>Glen Beck&rsquo;s show today had on some pretty influential figures who outlined a scenario in 2014 where the US reaches about the same status as Mexico, and it was obvious his guests held back on much of what they wanted to say, as did Beck.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough to the people here to prepare for bare survival and defense.  And if you refuse to do so, because you&rsquo;re in denial, then you&rsquo;ll wish to God you had, but by then it will probably be too late.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too many reputable types sounding the alarm that describes a catastrophe in the making.  These aren&rsquo;t doom and gloom kooks, and they have nothing to gain from their warnings.  In fact the info has to be practically forced from them because they&rsquo;re so reluctant to be more open, afraid of being accused of scare-mongering.  </p>

 I went into lunch at my favorite ex-bosses restraunt the other day. He`s a quiet  guy that I laughingly but sincerely  call &#8220;my moral compass.&#8221; I was schocked and alarmed but also impressed when he turned the conversation from burgers, to the economy to obtaining ammunition&hellip; Made me think of that line, &#8220;If ten men tell you your drunk, you need to lie down!&#8221; </p>

<p>They are not all interested in work, they know that we have better, easier and more profitable welfare and support programs here in the U.S. with no accountability. In Mexico and further  south they have, let me think a minute&hellip;none at all!!!!</p>

			<p>I think this is all a lie. With the increase in shootouts, murders, and the continuing collapse of the Mexican economy, I would think there&rsquo;s been an increase. The Mexican govt is not too far from falling apart in the face of the battle against the drug cartels, so that can only mean millions more Mexicans coming North to live off the Gringo. Which is exactly what the folks in charge of the US want. They believe chaos works in their favor.  </p>

<p>Many are respected financial advisors and organizations that have never given this kind of advice before.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a number of financial newsletters on line and via snail mail.  In previous years, their advice has been the usual &#8216;buy this, skip that&rsquo; and other banal information about the markets.</p>
<p>Lately, all of them have been warning us readers to prepare ourselves and our families for the coming chaos, riots and violence  &mdash;  which guns/ammunition are best, advising us to get any precious metals out of the banks ASAP, which safes to buy and how to hide them well in our homes, places where one can purchase 200 gallon fuel tanks, how to hide them and have them filled at odd hours so as not to attract attention, advice on how to purify water, how to store food and other supplies for at least three months, how to secure our homes, and strongly advising us to keep our mouths shut about what we&rsquo;re doing to avoid drawing attention from nosy neighbors or those who work in and around our homes.</p>
<p>I admit it&rsquo;s a bit frightening but one ignores this advice at one&rsquo;s peril.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;you&rsquo;ll wish to God you had, but by then it will probably be too late&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>My immediate family has stopped calling me Cassandra and quit joking about preparing myself like a crazed White survivalist  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re now asking my advice as to how to store food and other supplies.</p>
<p>Even my biggest critic, DH, asked me recently where I&rsquo;d hidden the water purification tablets and purification straws  &mdash;  and told me that maybe we&rsquo;d better buy more.</p>
<p>One financial advisor suggests making preparations a hobby, little by little, gathering supplies on the weekends, storing and hiding them well, remembering always to keep a very very low profile.</p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d be writing anything like this, let alone making actual preparations for possible coming anarchy and riots as if it&rsquo;s the end of the world  &mdash;  but perhaps it is.</p>

			<p>Thanks to massive numbers of white people defaulting on their McMansions, the legion of Latinos needed to tend their properties is no longer needed.  Well, there is one good thing comming out of this&hellip;You&rsquo;re on your way to becoming like that other &#8220;Great White Nation,&#8221; Russia.</p>

			<p>This is a blatant lie. Americans are putting pressure on lawmakers to get tough on illegal immigration by cracking down on employers who hire illegal aliens and building a real border fence. The same folks that have waged a war on middle class America for the last thiry years are using their media influence to fool middle class and working class Americans from defending their interests.</p>
