<h1>Black Caucus to Press Obama on Priorities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Evans, AP, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t slipped some [Congressional Black] caucus members&rsquo; attention, for example, that Obama first hosted congressional Republicans and the conservative Blue Dog Democrats in his push toward the political middle. They say it&rsquo;s their job to ensure he remains true to certain priorities, such as fixing inner-city poverty, that he once faced as a community organizer in Chicago.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows these issues, but I think it&rsquo;s very important that no group is taken for granted,&#8221; said Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who is president .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you&rsquo;re not in the room, your interests will be left on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet Obama maintained a distant relationship with the caucus when he was its only Senate member from 2004-08. That dynamic was on display early in the Democratic presidential primary, when many senior caucus members initially backed Hillary Rodham Clinton even as Obama quickly became viable as a candidate.</p>
<p>Those lawmakers eventually endorsed Obama, some realizing it could cost them politically if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Lee [Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif, caucus chairwoman] and others declined to discuss specific policy items that may come up at the meeting, which the caucus routinely holds with the president at the start of a new Congress. The list is likely to include concerns about the continued wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, diversity in administration jobs, the 2010 census and more help for homeowners facing foreclosure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members were quick to question the wisdom of Obama&rsquo;s failed appointment of Republican Sen. Judd Gregg as commerce secretary. {snip} Those concerns in part led Obama to announce that the White House would be more involved in directing the Census.</p>
<p>The Congressional Black Caucus also lent critical support to former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich&rsquo;s appointment of Roland Burris, who is black, to fill Obama&rsquo;s vacant Senate seat, even as the new administration and other leading Democrats resisted the move. In part, caucus members argued it was important to have at least one black senator.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, when the president convened a summit on reducing spending, Lee warned the White House about balancing the budget &#8220;on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, when the president convened a summit on reducing spending, Lee warned the White House about balancing the budget &ldquo;on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{snip}&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  Just what does that mean? Let me guess, those on welfare, food stamps, section 8, free medical, affrimative action and on and on, yes those may suffer a bit, while working people will only get taxed more to provide even more for those that caused (and continue to cause) this mess.</p>

			<p>Right now Obama and his administration are concentrating on their pro-black spending legislation and also their gun control plans.</p>
<p>They HAVE thrown a little bit of money at financial institutions in order to keep things from deteriorating too quickly, but they&rsquo;re taking this opportunity of fear and confusion to enact what they have been trying to get passed for the last few decades.</p>
<p>Next comes universal health care and re-enacting the assault weapons ban.  Registration and a ban on the importation of certain ammo is on the early agenda, with gun ownership laws enacted requiring about $500 from each person before they can buy a gun or ammo.</p>
<p>A top arms dealer was on T.V. this evening saying he&rsquo;s never seen such a rush to arms in his entire life, and he&rsquo;s an older man who has been in the arms trade all his life and his father before him.</p>
<p>He said ammo and arms have a waiting list from the manfacterer, because of such heavy buying.</p>
<p>Anyone out there who wants a gun and ammo by Summer better place an order right now or this administration and a Democrat Congress are just apt to lay some burdensome roadblocks in their way.  The AR 15 is considered an assault rifle so if you buy one now, it will be grandfathered in.</p>
<p>I bought everything I could possible need in November of last year, so I&rsquo;m all set to go.  I&rsquo;d strongly advise those who have done so yet to get started now.  There may not be much available and the laws might be too cumbersome as we get into the Summer.</p>

			<p>&#8220;such as fixing inner-city poverty&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a time when the inner-city had the wealth and the jobs.  The cities were the center of culture and commerce.  </p>
<p>Then in the 1960&rsquo;s the government had a plan to fix something that wasn&rsquo;t broken.  The government used its resouces to move blacks into the city and whites started moving out.  Now inner-city is practically synonymous with high-crime, poverty and decay.</p>

			<p>Native born White Americans must be true to White issues such as not being reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. President Barack Obama-an antiwhite Kenyan bigot- is hostile to White issues.</p>

			<p>&#8220;so I&rsquo;m all set to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget your children! All your young children BEFORE they leave home should have a Black rifle and a small concealible handgun. Doing this ensures that the &#8220;Gun Culture&#8221; lives even if you die, and, it innoculates your male children from the inevitable brainless, cosmopolitan nitwit womyn they might fall in love with and marry. The gift of a firearm is an insurance policy when such womyn attempt to prevent the aquisition of firearms after marriage.</p>

			<p>Lee warned the White House about balancing the budget &ldquo;on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess Obama really liked Lee&rsquo;s comment.  As the very &#8220;transparent&#8221; explanation of the recovery bill on recovery.gov shows on the higly detailed graph, $81B is going to &#8220;Protect the Vulnerable&#8221; population.  If it were actually transparent I would know if this means bald eagles or blacks.  I&rsquo;m thinking blacks.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I`d advise those who have not done so yet to get started now&hellip;&#8221;-Ranger<br>
Took a thousand out of the bank yesterday Ranger, and now have enough Luger ammuntion to relieve the Cherkassy pocket&hellip;<br>
Somehow it feels better than money in the bank to stare at it all in the hall closet. P.S. I had sorted and stored it and my other ammo by caliber. But my buddy told me to make a &#8220;wolverine&#8221; mix. That is, a little of each caliber  in every cache, to help out those who may not have any which the troubles hit. Sort of a Hookelau  Basket of ammo dumps&hellip;</p>

			<p>I wonder what mainstream white views will be towards &#8220;white guilt&#8221; and racial identity politics in the next 4 or 8 years.</p>

			<p>&#8220;fixing inner-city poverty&#8221;,,,,,,,</p>
<p>What exactly do blacks think here? That there is some magic formula that will do this? Poverty is usually a function of people&rsquo;s abilities, intelligence levels and work ethic, or lack of it. A 100 years ago the Ellis island era immigrants lived in vile slums on the east coast. They, or rather their descendents, have long since moved into the mainstream of American life. People with low I.Q.&rsquo;s, poor work ethic, social pathologies and dysfunctional family backgrounds are going to create a bleak environment for themselves (this is why Haiti is well, Haiti, for example). This can&rsquo;t be &#8220;fixed&#8221; like repairing a fallen down bridge or something. </p>
