			<p>   I won&rsquo;t bother to submit my ideas. There are much better minds than mine to cover this subject. I will only say this, Whites should and need to nationalize along racial lines due to the fact that ALL other races and peoples have already done so. They look after themselves. They hit the streets and make their voices heard. Whites should do the same thing. Whites owe it to their future generations to open roads for a better life for white people. Nobody stands up for whites, except whites.  As far as secession, we may have no other choice but to seceed from the union to form a homeland for whites. We are being taxed into oblivion as it is, and we receive nothing for it. Our government is NOT concerned about the welfare of the white people. They care ONLY about their precious minorities. The reasons for this thinking on the part of the government are too long to discuss here. I&rsquo;m sure anybody whom frequents AmRen on a regular basis needs no explanation. Good luck to all the participants on this essay. I can&rsquo;t wait to read the entries once they are posted. Racial nationalism followed by secession will be the saving grace of the white people. Without it, kiss our race goodbye. Patriotism should be for our race, not the country. The country abandoned us, now we must abandon it if we hope to survive. I never thought these words would ever come from me. But then, I would never have imagined in my worst dreams that our government would treat us this way.</p>

<p>There is no need for this, none at all!</p>
<p>I am a white man and an American, and this is my country, end of discussion!</p>
<p>These: blacks; Asians; &#8220;Latinos;&#8221; Arabs; and all the other assorted individuals &#8220;of color,&#8221; or otherwise &#8220;differently aggrieved&#8221; political positions, can simply get lost as far as I am concerned!</p>
<p>I do not see splitting this country up and handing chunks of it to the nonwhite breeders and feeders, as an &#8220;equitable&#8221; solution. Quite the contrary, my position is the same as that of the late and great Dr. Samuel T. Fancis; this being, that whites should reconquer their country. </p>
<p>As Dr. Francis himself noted in his March 1995 article for American Renaissance, &#8220;Prospects for Racial and Cultural Survival:&#8221;</p>
<p>Reconquest: </p>
<p>The answer is, quite simply, the reconquest of the United States. This reconquest does not involve any restoration of white supremacy in the political and legal sense that obtained under slavery or segregation, and there is no reason why nonwhites who reside in the United States could not enjoy equality of legal rights. But a white reconquest of the United States would mean the supremacy of whites in a cultural sense, or in the sense of what is nowadays called &ldquo;Eurocentrism.&rdquo; There are essentially three things that whites must do in order to carry out this reconquest of the nation and culture they have almost lost: </p>
<p>(1) Whites must formulate a white racial consciousness that identifies racial and biological endowments as important and relevant to social behavior, and their own racial endowments as essential to the continuing existence of Euro-American civilization. The formation of a white racial consciousness does not mean that whites should think of themselves only as whites, to the exclusion of ethnic, national, religious, regional, class, or other identities, nor that individuality should yield to the collective category of race. It means merely that we recognize racial realities, that we recognize that racial-biological endowments are necessary to certain kinds of human behavior (e.g., the political and civic behavior appropriate to stable self-government, the work habits and life-styles appropriate to a dynamic economy; the intellectual behavior that is necessary for science and scholarship, etc.) and that because these endowments are largely unique to whites, the behavior they make possible cannot be replicated by most nonwhites.  </p>
<p>Nor does the formation of white racial consciousness mean that we should conceive of ourselves only as biological beings to the exclusion of religious or metaphysical identities. Racial consciousness means that we add recognition of biological and racial factors to our traditional concepts of human nature and modify both our biological and non-biological conceptions of what man is, as evidence and reason dictate. It may be true that some traditional religious and metaphysical conceptions would not survive recognition of the scientific realities of race, just as some did not survive earlier scientific discoveries in astronomy, geology, and biology. </p>
<p>But the formation of white racial consciousness does mean that whites would recognize themselves as a race and their racially based behavior as legitimate, and hence it would mean the end of tolerance for nonwhite assaults on white people and the norms of white civilization. Whites would simply no longer countenance nonwhite aggression and insults or the idolization of nonwhite heroes, icons, and culture; white children would be raised in accordance with what is proper to being white, and norms openly recognized as appropriate to whites would be the legitimizing and dominant norms of American society as they were prior to the 1960s. Racial guilt and truckling would end. </p>
<p>(2) Based on this racial consciousness, whites must counter the demographic threat they face from immigration and nonwhite fertility and whites&rsquo; own infertility. This means (a) an absolute halt to all future legal immigration into the United States, deployment of the armed forces on the appropriate borders to cut off illegal immigration, and deportation of all illegal immigrants (and perhaps many recent legal immigrants); (b) the end of subsidies for the nonwhite birth rate through welfare programs, obligatory use of contraception by welfare recipients, and encouragement of its use among nonwhites, and (c) encouragement of increases in white fertility. </p>
<p>(3) Whites must correct the political and legal order to end the political power of nonwhite minorities and their white anti-white allies. This political effort would involve a radical dismantling of all affirmative action and civil rights legislation as well as a good part of the federal governmental superstructure that entrenches minority power. It also would require recovering an understanding of constitutional law that permits local and state governments to govern, and private institutions to function independently of government.</p>
<p>In short, as I see it, the legalized and enforced development of a &#8220;white racial consciousness,&#8221; that is unapologetic. Moreover, that also employs, for lack of a better term, &#8220;punitive ostracism&#8221; against all whites who refuse to comply with it as a governing policy of the USA. That would be the overriding key element here, the total smashing of the totalitarian &#8220;multicultural&#8221; dynamic that we now live under.</p>
<p>From there, and as Dr. Francis also notes, white majority preservation and enhancement should be embarked upon. Along with ever tightening and strict reductions in nonwhites&rsquo; pernicious influences on our culture and country at every measurable level. It does not have to be bloody, or even require excessive force, as a break-up might; it only requires a determined understanding that &#8220;freedom&#8221; for nonwhites has limits in the USA. These limits being, &#8216;live by our established rules and standards, or get out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad that you both broached the subject and used The Bard&rsquo;s own words to do so.  However, this is going to have to relate to the one and only issue with which I disagreed with The Bard, that being the White History Month debate between he and Lou Calabro.</p>
<p>On the one hand, The Bard advocates the &#8220;punitive ostracism&#8221; strategy when it comes to whites reimposing themselves on the entirety of what is now known as the USA.  However, he thought that whites should not have a history month because it would relegate us to a month when the whole year should be about us.</p>
<p>Whites are going to need to think of themselves as whites if they/we have any chance at the punitive ostracism strategy.  To get that, I would gladly take a month, hell just a day.  Anything FUBU (For Us By Us).</p>
<p>I do agree with the premise.  What use would it for an aracinated egalitarian white population to get its own partition of the former USA when they screwed up the whole USA with their race liberalism.  In other words, any whites that could &#8220;whiten&#8221; up to rule a partition could just as well have the whole thing.</p>

I&rsquo;m not as articulate as you are with words but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to take the country back in one piece.  I&rsquo;ve thought along the same lines as you but the election served as a wakeup call to me.  As incredible as it sounds to me, there are too many Whites who simply aren&rsquo;t interested in preserving the White majority.  Too many communists, anti-racists and naive young people to overcome the political forces against us.  Secession seems to be the only viable option.  Force these stupid Whites to go live among their precious minorities.  </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem w/whites seceding from the US as long as we take &#8220;our&#8221; nukes w/us. Otherwise a future Obama or Mugabe type might use them against us.</p>

			<p>Secession will never work and is a waste of time and mind energy for three simple reasons; 1. We would be surrounded by hostile neighbors who would constantly threaten us and would make it a goal to attempt to conquer us once new borders were settled or somehow demarkaded and defending those borders would be exhausting. That is assuming a large war of secession did not result in reason number 3 below.  2. We would have to be self sustaining and supportive of one another in order to have any chance of survival, that smacks of functional Marxism for too many White secessionists (from what I gather) and so we would be a gaggle of individuals arguing over things like whose religion was the most correct and who should be included in the movement and who is a traitor, crypto Jews, etc., and probably kill each other off, or at least prepare us for reconquering.  3.  If America broke up into two or more smaller states with no connections, instability in the entire world would result.  A scramble for new advantages would ensue and large wars (not just one) would likely break out.  Trade ties would collapse and large numbers of people would begin to starve and quickly grow desperate.  The amount of nuclear weapons left about would likely lead to one - more likely many more being used.  Aside from the nuclear threat, we would likely see common diseases become pandemics.</p>
<p>I forgot reason 4.  4. There would be no television, no sports, no NASCAR, no Hunting/Fishing network, no back yard barbecues, and no Nashville as is known today or yesterday.</p>
<p>  Secession would likely result in a roll of the dice and more than likely result in a huge human catastrophe.  But that has already been predicted by certain scientists/philosophers like Issac Asimov.</p>
<p>Think twice before indulging in secession fantascies.</p>
<p>Now, send me my $1,000.00.</p>

			<p>   John PM, I love your ideas and they are well articulated. But, I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t work now, that window closed with the death of the great Dr. Francis. I too, was an admirer of him. But the government is against us, as is 40% of our own people. What, other than secession, do we have left as tools to work with considering the circumstances? Racial nationalism would be a great starting point, as long as we have a sustainable power base to work from. And I really believe that racial nationalism was what Dr. Francis was talking about. Bottom line, we need a homeland. I would love nothing more than to retake the entire country. But, with the numbers working against us, is it possible? Congress and the White House will be no help what-so-ever. At least in my eyes, 21 states have or are in the process of giving the federal govt. notice that they are sovereigns. That is a positive move. As the movement progresses, more states will join, and give notice to the feds to cease and desist their absolute power grab. If the feds cut off federal funding, cut off all taxes paid to the federal govt. Regardless, something must happen, and soon. </p>

			<p>Secession means handing over large tracts of American territory to mexico,china,india,pakistan and india. Or to put it another, China&rsquo;s borders borders will extend a couple of hundred miles into OUR  America. Who gets the miltary bases in California? Secession is infantile thinking. There has to be a plan to push post-1965 non-whites out of OUR America.</p>
<p>Secession offers the delusion of security and safety. But it is just that,a delusion</p>

			<p>The purpose of this contest was to encourage thought and discussion, and by the looks of things here, it is already a success.</p>
<p>For John PM to say &#8220;I am a white man and an American, and this is my country, end of discussion!&#8221; is empty bravado unless a sufficient number of other people are willing to stand up and say it with you. It does not have to be a majority, but merely a sufficiently active and powerful minority. </p>
<p>The chances of bringing together a group like that sufficient to take back the whole United States strikes me as minimal. And if it did coalesce, then it would have to face the question of where to put 100 million nonwhites, some populations of which were here before we were. </p>
<p>The breakup of the United States would make help with both of these problems. Imagine that the US federal government collapsed like those of the USSR or Yugoslavia, and sovereignty reverted to the individual states. There would be a number of newly-sovereign states with virtually all-white populations. These states would no longer have Washington, New York, and Hollywood dictating their political, economic, and racial politics. In states like this, it might actually be possible to institute the policies necessary to save our race, whereas there is virtually no chance to do so in the present United States.</p>
<p>To Whiteplight: You need to look at what happened when the USSR and Yugoslavia broke up. There was some bloodshed, to the extent that secession and partition were resisted by locals and the international community, but nothing apocalyptic. </p>
<p>(1)Somehow the difficulties of demarcating and defending borders have not caused the nearly 200 nations in the world today to throw in the towel, and I do not think it would stop white men who wish to take control of their own destiny. </p>
<p>(2)It is not news that the large contingent of cranks and kooks in today&rsquo;s racialist movement are an impediment to racial progress. Perhaps the movement needs to secede from them right now.</p>
<p>(3)Given the United States&rsquo; role in today&rsquo;s world, the end of the US would probably make the world a safer and more stable place.  </p>
<p>(4)Famine and pestilence are not held in abeyance by the all-wise Feds. NASCAR, BBQ, etc. do not flow from the Federal Government, unless you are a ward or employee of the Feds. All of these would continue in some form or another. But we have to face facts: people for whom these are the most important things in life are part of the problem, not part of the solution. </p>

Barack is going to be a victim of circumstances, that is for sure. A victimization complex at the core of his personality may be the reason for his nonchalance in these most perilous of times.</p>
<p>I think a valid third party effort is needed to break the deadlock of the duopoly which invites domination by oligarchs and suffocates political dissent. I am concerned since by midcentury the consequences for our country of this latest binge of deficit spending will become clear. The debt service is going to be paid to sovereign wealth funds, not to &ldquo;us&rdquo; as it is usually described. A revolutionary situation will develop because all solutions proposed by the then-establishment will clearly be counterproductive, and make that extremely so. When we pay our taxes in the future, much of the wealth we consign over to the federal government will be shipped to overseas accounts of countries such as China who likely will be in fierce economic competition with us for remaining global markets and resources. </p>
<p>So the reason people will pay taxes then is &hellip;to hasten our demise? I don&rsquo;t think so; and to prepare for that eventuality a powerful third party must be started now so there will be a legitimate channel for the ultimate dissent: secession. Our backs will absolutely be against the wall by then.</p>
<p>Reasons? Well,the federal government will have to resort to an army of  Treasury Police to enforce acceptance and usage of the dollar in economic transactions, all of which will be subject to onerous value-added taxes. Additionally, in order to regularize the economy further there will be extensive wage and price controls once the inflation generated by this &#8220;stimulus&#8221; takes hold. This will of course result in a huge black market, in turn a further reason for policing of the economy in a soviet-style manner. Dissent will become linked to economic crime and will be outlawed.</p>
<p>But as I have said above the revolutionary situation may develop because the USA is a debtor nation; essentially a financial colony of the sovereign wealth funds of China and other holders of our TBills. Taxation, already onerous, will become unbearable in light of the fact that the collection of taxes itself will hasten our economic demise. The &#8220;original 13 colony&#8221; mentality will reassert itself. Prosperity will frankly be seen never to be realizable unless a re-ordering of the borders takes place to enable the productive to separate themselves and rid themselves of dollar debt.</p>
<p>Ergo, secession.  </p>

			<p>One thing I know.  And I know it very well.  The war for hearts and minds will not be won through rational thought or science.  Much as Humans flatter themselves with such names as Homo Sapiens Sapiens, the reality is that the vast majority of Humans are highly emotional beings.  We could have a million &#8220;Race Evolution and Behavior&#8221;s on our side but one &#8220;A Time to Kill&#8221; outweighs them all in the mind of the masses.  We must appeal to emotions.</p>

			<p>Mark&rsquo;s post is excellent. </p>
<p>We will have no progress until whites realize that the United States is no longer &#8220;our country,&#8221; and has not been our country for a long, long time. We had a revolution when enough people realized that they could govern their own affairs for their own interests, rather than being governed for the interests of the British establishment. </p>
<p>Now white Americans are being taxed to support non-whites, our jobs are being exported to non-whites, we delay or limit or forgo reproduction because we are being forced to subsidize non-white reproduction, and our government and moneyed elite have sold us out, by turning our society into a colony of international capitalism. </p>
<p>If our race were to reestablish political control over the United States, we might be able to end non-white immigration and preferences, but we would still be stuck with a plutocracy that has sold us into debt servitude. White people deserve better than that. </p>
<p>To do better, we have to stop thinking like conservatives and think more like revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Why not figuratively liquidate the regime (or let it liquidate itself), repudiate the debt, and start from scratch? Why not seize the fortunes that have been made by dismantling the our industrial economy, and use it to recapitalize local industry? Why not create a host of new nations with greater racial homogeneity and more manageable sizes? Why not let the vast urban colonies of liberal whites and their pet non-whites fend for themselves, as independent city states? </p>
<p>I see no reason for piety over the Constitution. We can come up with a better one. White people create ordered liberty like blacks create chaos and tyranny: it is in our genes. Besides, the Constitution did nothing to prevent us from arriving at the present situation. If we were merely to turn back the clock 200 years, our descendants would be in the same mess 200 years from now. </p>

			<p>Whether it&rsquo;s secession or taking back America, there&rsquo;s an urgent call to do something NOW.  I joined the White Nationalist Movement in 1994 and the changes that have happened in the 15 years since have been astonishing.  America as a nation is in decline, our culture is almost obliterated and our economy is in shambles.  </p>

			<p>I have to say that, although I agree with Dr. Francis for the most part, I have two disagreements with him:</p>
<p>1. I, like many others on this forum, think that secession is the only feasible option. We will lose quite a bit of land and pristine country, but it&rsquo;s ultimately worth it.</p>
<p>2. I disagree with his contraception policies, as I think that they are immoral. We should not require people on welfare to be on contraception for a number of reasons, besides the moral ones.</p>
<p>Firstly, it simply wouldn&rsquo;t be feasible  &mdash;  if a woman wants to become pregnant, she can do so  &mdash;  not to mention the fact that you&rsquo;re asking a welfare woman to take her birth control pills systematically/dutifully  &mdash;  yeah right.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if you could find a way to get a woman to remain without child while she is on welfare, you&rsquo;d end up punishing whites as well as nonwhites. The Romans called their poorest citizens &#8220;proletarii,&#8221; which comes from the Latin word &#8220;proles,&#8221; which means &#8220;offspring, descendant.&#8221; Anyone care to venture a guess as to why they would so name their poorest citizens? It&rsquo;s because the proletarii&rsquo;s only attraction was that they could produce Roman babies for the state  &mdash;  that was their sole duty as poor citizens.</p>
<p>I am a fairly well-off young guy, but even I am acquainted with (very) large white families who rely on the state for certain &#8220;gimmes&#8221;  &mdash;  and, quite frankly, I&rsquo;m glad to give those gimmes to them since they&rsquo;re white. After all, they are contributing white bodies to our society.</p>
<p>Also, only considering white people, the poorer a woman is, the more likely she is to have children. Therefore, by requiring white women to be on contraception while they are on welfare would actually decrease our own fertility rate.</p>
<p>Now, someone might object to this, saying: &#8220;But there are more nonwhites on welfare than whites. Therefore, such a policy would decrease the birthrate of nonwhites more than it would that of whites.&#8221; Granted. But let&rsquo;s keep in mind that the birthrate of whites all around the world is already significantly below replacement level. This means that WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO EXTINCTION. We can&rsquo;t afford to take many more hits on our own birthrate.</p>
<p>This, of course, ties into the idea of secession. The world is plenty big enough to hold a bunch more people, despite what the liberal population control experts say. Let them have their land, and we can have ours. Let them reproduce as they wish, and let us reproduce as we should.</p>
<p>Other more militant people might also say that we could simply only require nonwhites on welfare to be on contraception. Indeed, Dr. Francis thought that we should encourage nonwhites to be on contraception.</p>
<p>With all due respect to the eminent scholar, this makes no sense  &mdash;  that is to say, it makes no sense to have such an overt policy that specifically targets the reproduction of a race, but at the same time, expect to live with (any of) them peacefully in one society. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier just to secede and not live with them in one society?</p>
<p>But, morally speaking, if we are to succeed, we have to have principles, and those principles cannot be merely mundane. We have to instill in our people a reason to go on, and that reason cannot be only aesthetic, earthly, or, as a more cynical man might say, nostalgic.</p>
<p>As for you who think that birth control is not immoral: It would do you well to consider this question: How can a (white) traditional Roman Catholic ideally live in a society that he shares with a (white) pagan? How can a (white, for the sake of argument) Muslim live harmoniously in society with a (white) quasi-liberal Protestant? I ask these questions because we have to agree on what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong before we can be successful. In other words, we have to overcome our own diversities before we can overcome things like racial diversity.</p>

			<p>To criticize other people is to invite criticism of ones self.  This fact is central to the denial we see about inter- as well as intra-racial differences.  </p>
<p>Whites however, have the most to be proud of.  If we remind the upper as well as the lower class whites of this fact, they will be less afraid to criticize others and get down to the truth of the matter.  Also, they will be less afraid to stand up for our race.</p>
<p>Present them with facts and statistics that they do not hear in the multicultural media machine.  Encourage them to confront their own fears of inadequacy so they will not be devestated when angry multiculturalists (among others) call them out.</p>
<p><br>
It is paramount that we encourage a welcoming environment for all whites, whatever class they occupy in society.</p>
<p>Also, we must either persuade controlers of the mainstream media to advocate for white nationalism or we must become the mainstream media.</p>
<p>This will help us reach a far wider audience than we currently do.</p>
<p>People with only limited experience of diversity are vulnerable to whatever they think polite society will allow them to believe.  If television advocates a point of view all the time over several decades, then many will be inclined to follow it.</p>
<p>Our efforts to convert others should first focus on influential people who can reach large audiences as well as soldiers willing to stand up and defend the white nationalist cause.</p>
<p>I believe a non-white deportation order, enforced by the military will the the only way to create a true white nationalist society!</p>
<p>This will not be an easy path but with persistance we will cast off the non-white burden imposed upon white nations by greed, force, fear and propaganda.</p>

			<p>Great article, Great idea, Great posts! Personally, I think everyone should contribute an essay, even if we can&rsquo;t write all that well, just to show our support and to bring ourselves closer to the issue at hand through direct participation. </p>
<p>First - one thing the comments have made certain is that the first question to be settled is Secession or Reconquest (I don&rsquo;t like that last word but it&rsquo;ll serve for now).</p>
<p>Second - another important point that emerges from the comments is something that, though initially a bit disturbing, could actually help us to sit up straight in our seats, so to speak and really take this thing very seriously.  And that is - it is very possible that none of this is going to end very well. That this crisis might not have a happy ending. In short, it&rsquo;s make or break time and we have got to be in to win.</p>
<p>For now though one thing is sure;<br>
We need an Organizing Principle - a very clear, unmistakable, and inspiring organizing principle. I can think of one, but I&rsquo;m going to save it for later. </p>
<p>I believe is was Steve Sailer who defined Race as an extended family.  So, then, a good question would be &#8220;What is the state of the Family today - specifically that of Whites? <br>
Like everything else, it isn&rsquo;t in very good shape. The family is the first teach-learning institution that we will go through in life. It is not producing individuals who are prepared and willing to participate in a Democratic society because their families were not democratic. Many were autocratic and violent and unloving. So to get that all important need to experience ones own value, as well as that all important need to belong (and the two go together of course) many have been running into the arms of the State, and the people who occupy that institution have turned it into one big, fat, bloated, King Baby Monster, because so many of them come from families like&hellip;the Kennedy&rsquo;s or the Clinton&rsquo;s, and not just them. Heck, no self-righteousness here, you can add me to the list, and I&rsquo;m sure most people for that matter. It is an issue that has been shamefully neglected and to our detriment.  <br>
The result is, we have a lot of people who are operating out of a rag bag of emotions, and ideas, that are unsettling mix of sentimentality, cynicism and ignorance. Our opposition can only sustain itself by force since the best it can do is make vague utopian appeals to its supporters that it can in no way make good on, and threats and attacks on those who oppose them.<br>
And those who oppose them come from all walks of life.<br>
I have often humored myself with the thought that the real reason the PC Multi-Culti&rsquo;s go on and on about Diversity is to conceal the fact that Whites are hands down the most diverse Race on the planet.<br>
What I see under attack today even more than Whites is - Reality. The Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan represents the single greatest mass movement flight from reality mankind has ever witnessed and if it plays itself out it will end as any mass does - disintegration, bringing us with it. The more Reality is attacked like this, the more the survival of the species will be in question. In short, this is an opportunity. <br>
What to do? Well that is what the essay competition seems to be asking. I&rsquo;m sure the good people at TOQ would agree that it&rsquo;s certainly going to take more than an essay, but it&rsquo;s an important start, and, you&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere.<br>

For most whites in America, the concepts of succession and white nationalism still seem strange and unnecessary. They don&rsquo;t see the writing on the wall yet.</p>
<p>I think strategic thinking should be on the question: </p>
<p>&#8220;What Can We Do To Wake Up Our Fellow Whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the essay contest I would like to see. </p>
<p>It can start with little things like tee-shirts and bumper stickers, and letters to newspaper editors. But there have to be more powerful approaches .  .  .</p>

<p>I think you are completely wrong about contraception politics.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s not just white skin which we should care about, but civilization and culture, therefore it&rsquo;s extremely important who has children and who doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Actually you hear something like &#8220;the poorer a woman is, the more likely she is to have children&#8221;  quite often, and it&rsquo;s always presented as an universal law of nature, which is completely wrong. Throughout history it was almost always the smart, rich and industrious who had the most children - that was actually the reason why we were able to get past the stone age and build civilization. </p>
<p>Only in periods of decay (and when you talk about the proletarii in Rome you talk about such a period of decay) this is reversed. And it cannot go on forever: If a couple can only survive with subsidies, it&rsquo;s pretty likely that on average their children will be similar. If those people become more in every generation, they will need more subsidies every generation - sooner or later the whole system breaks down, which is exactly what happened in Rome and which will happen in the Western world probably before 2020.</p>
<p>Second, the main reason why intelligent people have so few children is that they are forced to sacrifice themselves for the poor. The whole non-white welfarism is just an extension to this theme. Now I&rsquo;m all for welfare for those who had bad luck (a family who lost their father because he was killed in a car accident is the most typical example which is happening literally every day.) but this must be strictly voluntary, therefore strictly private.</p>
<p>Before the welfare state, intelligent Whites had enough children.</p>
<p>The welfare state has caused this period of decay we are in. It must be destroyed before it destroys us.<br>

			<p>I would love to be in a position to contribute whatever I could in order to accomplish a return to what we had and what we SHOULD have.  But the problem I see for myself, and likely also for JewAmongYou is: will us non-Christian whites be allowed? Do some of you even consider us white? </p>
<p>Or will the movement be bogged down with &#8220;who is white enough&#8221;? I say leave that nonsense to the race pimps.</p>
<p>I am both Jewish, and one other type much vilified on this site by people who pigeonhole people by what they are, not who they are.  </p>
<p>I also have a love of, and a longing for, what this country was, and would like to have it back.  A return to the low crime rates, ability to walk or drive the streets in relative safety, live in a neighborhood for the remainder of my life without it going into decline. A society of people who can articulate their thoughts without resorting to gutter language.  One where I am not told what car I will drive or how many gallons of water can flow out of the kitchen tap.</p>
<p>Will you allow my kind to help bring back what is rightfully ours? I&rsquo;m more than ready.</p>

			<p>Just a few thoughts:<br>
Secession is not a realistic option. We would face the whole establishment which happens to have control over the World&rsquo;s most powerful military, they will never give up their power. What we can do though is move individual states towards greater independence from the Federal Govt. We also need to govern those states in the real spirit and word of the Constitution. There was a Governor of Alaska who was voted in on a platform of Alaskan Independence, although he did not get far. There is definitely a cadre of States which are very definite possibilities for at least partial independence, I am thinking of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Alabama,, Arkansas, Kansas, I am sure there are others. I don&rsquo;t think we should get too hung up on race either, surely it is our culture that we are trying to preserve. Michelle Malkin is Filipina but she is as Anglo and Euro-centric in her beliefs as any of us. <br>
What we need is a new grassroots party (I am sure there are not too many of us with any faith in the Republicans) that will organise at the local and State level, perhaps initially through State referenda.<br>
Great ideas on this thread!</p>

			<p>To RdC:</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I appreciate your opinions.</p>
<p>You say: &#8220;First, it&rsquo;s not just white skin which we should care about, but civilization and culture&hellip;&#8221; What civilization? What culture? The Jonas Brothers? Sex, drugs, and rock &#8216;n roll? Modern art (which is dominated by white males, by the way)? 1.7 children per woman? Diversity of religion (which means, by definition, that there are more than one culture/civilization)? Feminism? Environmentalism? Animal Rights Movements? Because if that&rsquo;s the civilization that you want to preserve or secede to, you can count me out.</p>
<p>As for your second point, I&rsquo;m not an historian. However, it is a sociological fact that, right now, at least, women who live in America and who have little education and financial resources have more children than women who have more education and financial resources. I suggest you look into a book called &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; if you need further proof of this.</p>
<p>You say: &#8220;Only in periods of decay (and when you talk about the proletarii in Rome you talk about such a period of decay) this is reversed.&#8221; This is simply not true. The proletarii were known throughout Rome&rsquo;s existence for providing a great stock of new citizens for the state. Again, this was the case even in Rome&rsquo;s rise and peak.</p>
<p>Also, I must say that I simply disagree with your neo-liberal, capitalist mentality. The reason why a substantial number of good, hardworking (white, if you prefer) people are on welfare is because of the greedy financial elite. Ultimately, if the greedy financial elite are going to acquire a stranglehold on all the wealth, they are going to have to either kill the excess poor people, or they are going to have to provide them handouts.</p>
<p>You say: &#8220;Second, the main reason why intelligent people have so few children is that they are forced to sacrifice themselves for the poor.&#8221; Again, not true. The &#8220;main reason&#8221; why intelligent people have so few children is because they&rsquo;re selfish. Period. When I look out my apartment window and see all the luxurious cars drive by my window, I realize just how good people have it (financially, at least) in this country. When I see all the young adults with their laptops, ipods, video games, movies, etc., etc., I simply cannot help but be led to the conclusion that people simply don&rsquo;t want children. Children cut into their relaxing evenings, their expensive dinners, their toned bodies, their hopes of purchasing a nice house, nice car, boat, etc. With all due respect, I think that it&rsquo;s pretty clear why the upper-class, intelligent people don&rsquo;t have children, and the reason ain&rsquo;t what you say it is.</p>

<p>Secession is infantile idea. Anyone who thinks that secession is a serious idea is ignoring a massive amount of reality. Secession  will result in the borders of China, Mexico,Paksitan,India, the Muslim Word and Korea extending  deep inside America. This should be patently obvious. How would this make Native Born White Americans more secure is beyond my comprehension. Previous posters in this thread have pointed out some of them non-trivial complications and problems with secession.</p>
<p>There is a very deep point that you and other secessionists seem to be oblivious to and it is this:White Nationailist are suppose to encourage their fellow White Amerians to FIGHT BACK!!!! WE are suppose to set an example of uncompromising resistance. WE are not suppose to offer and encourage  surrender option. </p>
<p>In the strongest possible terms, I oppose sitting down with representaves of the chinese,muslims,hispanics,african, hindu and pakistani race-based  nation states within the borders of America having a discussion as to how far china&rsquo;s borders should extend into America. Do you not have any fightng spirit within you? </p>
<p>Resistance to post-1965 immigrants has grown significantly since 1990. To be honest,it is a night and day difference. Obviously, the level and intensity of the revolt against the invasion has a long way to go. Catastrophic events will shatter many illusions and expose the double standard in a far more powerfull  and dramatic way than all the warnings of catastrophe that have come  from the White Nationalist and immigration reform movements over the past years.</p>
<p>The combination of White Secession and a rapidly growing  non-white population in the raced -based microstaes on the boundary of the White Homelands will create an unstable and explosive situation within the borders of the former USA. Think about the different scenarios. Whites will have a smaller living space. What if the White population starts to increase in this reduced territory. There will be massive stress on ecosystems. The amenties will be lost. National and State Parks within the reduced territory of Native Born White Americans will be paved over so as to provide middle class housing for Native Born White Americans. There will be severe-there already is in the Southern states. It will eventually fell very overcrowded in the reduced living space of Nativ Born White Americans. Existence in the White Homelands will become hellish. These are the  scenarios  I hsve written many times before on this website. Sprawl is rapidly creeping out from Charlotte towards both Ashville and towards Boone. Moreover, where is the H20 to sustain a growing Native Born White population in the South suppose to come from? In the non-white areas of the former America,one can say with 100 percent certainty that there will be a massive ecological catastrophe. It is infantile to think that the White areas of the former America will be unaffected.</p>
<p>It is also treasonous to advocate- as Clyde Wilson has recently advocated- handing over American territory to Mexico,China,India,Pakistan,Korea and the Muslim world.</p>

			<p>     America is going to break up anyway no matter what we do or<br>
don&rsquo;t do. And it&rsquo;s not going to be pretty. Get out of the Cities<br>
and other Minority areas. And once in White, rural areas, what<br>
could be more natural than to work towards independence? If we<br>
fail to do so, than we are unworthy of our forbears and our whole<br>
branch of the White Race is going to die off. Take back America?<br>
How? By logical persuasion? They don&rsquo;t care. With the moral high-<br>
ground? Dream on. By force of arms? Lunacy. The time for all this<br>
was decades ago. A few good men tried and failed. And most of them were confused themselves about the ultimate nature of this<br>
struggle. For a long time the struggle was mixed up with Repub-<br>
licanism and Conservatism-both of which have shown their coward-<br>
ly natures and mixed motives. The alchemy of time has separated<br>
us from them. The struggle is clear now. The only questions left<br>
are ones of strategy and tactics.<br>
       As David Lane said, &#8220;Create a White Homeland or die try-<br>
ing. There are several locations but the best and Whitest large<br>
chunk of land is the Northwest. And the practical work on this<br>
has already begun. Just google Northwest Homeland and find out<br>
how to Come Home.</p>

<p>I used this analogy from Tolkiens great trilogy The Lord of the Rings. For it seems that we have reached a similiar point in time. This seemed appropriate to me.</p>
<p>I read great arguments here at Amren for and against the subject of seccession. Some very astute minds here!<br>
I like the idea of seccession because I truly favor the notion of a White homeland. However the devil as always will be in the details.</p>
<p>What will the central gov&rsquo;t do? I am sure that they will not allow this to happen. They need the tax base. washington also seems bent on the subjugation of our people. Any attempt at seperation will probably result in bringing the full force of the post american govt. and military to bear against us.<br>
Moreover, What about resources? What about nukes? As another poster noted. What type of gov&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>What a confused state of affairs!<br>
If we do not have a homeland we will almost certainly face slow extirpation. This will be very painfull! </p>
<p>Maybe a partial combination of seperation and reconquest, combining the most viable parts of each.<br>
One thing is clear to me. We don&rsquo;t have much more time left. I feel a sense of urgency greateer than any I have ever known.</p>
<p>Keep trying may brothers and sisters at Amren.<br>

			<p>I continue to be astonished at the number of white nationalists who claim that seccession is an unreasonable pipe dream yet claim that white&rsquo;s should &#8220;take back the country&#8221; as a whole.  <br>
America as a whole will NEVER be a white nation again.  It is demographically impossible.  Even if all immigration is stopped and all illegals are deported, there are too many blacks and browns to reverse this trend unless whites start having 4 or 5 children each.  Seccession is the only option.  </p>
<p>I, for one, am not interested in world conquest.  I simply want a nation, even a small one, were I can live out my days in peace and know that my children will grow up in a safe culture that represents their ethnic identity.  The quest for global domination is what got us into this mess to begin with.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best option currently available is an independent South.  The region already has a history of independence and most whites here are, at least implicitly, racially conscious.  After the South secedes, the blacks here will most likely flee north rather than live in a nation with no welfare state and a strict criminal justice system that reflects the will of the majority white Southern population.  <br>
Whites in the rest of the country will see the writing on the wall as the U.S. crumbles into socialism and civil unrest.  Midwestern states like Kansas and Nebraska will probably break off as well and join up with South.  Likewise, there will probably be seccessionist uprisings in the Mountain West, Alaska, and parts of New England.  </p>
<p>Unlike some posters, I think the creation of a state like Aztlan will be greatly beneficial to our cause.  Most of the nation&rsquo;s Hispanics will be isolated in the newly created nation.  There will be a corresponding crackdown on illegal immigration in the remaining U.S. which does not bode well for Hispanics because most of them outside of the Southwest are illegal.  Also, large numbers of white trapped in Aztlan will flee towards the U.S., increasing the percentage of America made up of whites.</p>
<p>Not only will seccession create new white homelands on this continent, it will also give us a chance to watch the socialists whites live with the mess they&rsquo;ve created.  When they come crawling to get into our new nations, I say seal the border.  They&rsquo;ve made their bed, now they can lay in it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;a powerful third party must be started now.</p>
<p>Is it possible?  We&rsquo;d be fighting the likes of powerful, massively funded organizations such as the SPLC, ACLU, ADL, JDL along with the Justice Department  &mdash;  those who forcefully prevent our organizing at the present time and would happily prosecute, bankrupt and destroy our lives in the name of Hate Crimes and trying to foment a Fourth Reich.</p>
<p>And the Federal Government is about to become a whole lot more powerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Reasons? Well,the federal government will have to resort to an army of Treasury Police to enforce acceptance and usage of the dollar in economic transactions&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark, I wanted to thank you for the most brilliant post of the entire week, and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>Along with the things you mentioned, I believe there will be gold confiscation, gun confiscation, enaction of the Fairness Doctrine, censorship of the Internet, federal regulations to prevent the movement of money out of the US, a new ID system requiring the government&rsquo;s permission to travel internally  &mdash;  along with coming riots and violence, lots of violence. Is it any wonder we often write here about arming ourselves while it is still possible along with the best ways to hide our gold and guns? </p>
<p>Martial law will be declared and there have been reports of an internal, government-sponsored militia being formed to deal with the coming Civil Unrest. </p>
<p>All in the name of increasing the government&rsquo;s power over our lives.  We are not emulating the failed USSR, we are becoming the USSR with all its attendant horrors.</p>

			<p>  The reason white people have this self loathing is because over the last fifty years the communists have slowly taken over the agents of change. They have taken over the media and the schools, and particularly the journalism schools. The news media is infested with self loathing whites. This is not by accident. The level of programming a young white person is subjected to in their first 22 years of life is hard to overcome, but not impossible. Most of us on this forum were probably subjected to this same propaganda, but as we became adults reality hit us in the face. We quickly decided we didn&rsquo;t want to live in the multicultural suburb, and left it at that. With years and age however, came wisdom and the idea slowly grew that race is real; and that we want to be with our own kind, and we needn&rsquo;t feel quilt about it.</p>
<p>  In the 70&rsquo;s there was a made for TV movie &#8220;Roots&#8221;, which kicked white guilt into high gear, and at the same time inspired blacks to a greater racial identity than they previously had.</p>
<p>  What we need is a sort of stealth version of &#8220;Roots&#8221; for white people. An outright racial statement would of course be ruthlessly censored, but a well done movie or book with an underlying theme of the white races&rsquo; accomplishments and likely future demise might work. </p>

			<p>Interesting, I seemed to have created some &#8220;buzz&#8221; with my Friday comments and my support for Dr. Fancis&rsquo;s position. Well, I am glad that at the very least I have stimulated some debate on this topic here at AR, if for nothing else, since it could potentially not only impact us soon, but a vast number of future generations to come. </p>
<p>To Question Diversity, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites are going to need to think of themselves as whites if they/we have any chance at the punitive ostracism strategy. To get that, I would gladly take a month, hell just a day. Anything FUBU (For Us By Us).&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you make an interesting point here and I do not disagree with it out of hand. However, I would like to ask you if might not this point have become somewhat moot, if a large majority of whites did suddenly begin to think of themselves as the collective and unquestioned dominate racial group of the USA again, as we once did barely 60 years ago? </p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>
<p>To Anonymous at 11:03 PM on February 20, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;Secession seems to be the only viable option. Force these stupid Whites to go live among their precious minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it may well be?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think that it has come to that yet, or that things are as bleak as you currently see them. Indeed, this election was an utter shock to me as well; I honestly was so upset about seeing this &#8220;magic&#8221; mulatto and his comrades in the Democratic Party win, that I threw up when the results were clear on election night. But, another hard fact is, that whites still do make up about 65% of the total population, some 200 million people. Moreover, Comrade BO has a lot of work to do and even if he does it well, it is not a given that he will reap any rewards for it. From what I have seen so far of his (and his congressional comrades&rsquo;)<br>
economic &#8220;stimulus&#8221; antics, this is not going to happen. </p>
<p>If in four years we are still: in a &#8220;deep recession,&#8221; suffering from an increasing inflation, and deeper in debt, what then?</p>
<p>Perhaps, a vast majority of whites will have a different kind of wake up call?</p>
<p>To white man, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be confused John as to whose country it actually is. That surprises me with you being from Detroit Michigan - er, used to be in Detroit Michigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not sure what you exactly meant by that WM?</p>
<p>Are you referring to the general blackness and chaos of the city, as being representative of the country as a whole; or are you questioning my cynicism as an ex-Detroiter?</p>
<p>Just wondering and sorry if I am missing something WM. </p>
<p>To Anonymous at 8:29 AM on February 21, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;At least in my eyes, 21 states have or are in the process of giving the federal govt. notice that they are sovereigns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two quick questions Anonymous,</p>
<p>1.) Just wondering which states do you see doing this? I know that: Texas, Alaska, and Hawaii all do have active independence movements, but which are the other 18 that you see as moving in this direction?</p>
<p>2.) Are you the same Anonymous 11:03 PM on February 20?</p>
<p>To Nicholas, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well thats all well and done, but that cannot happen. It is an impossibility. I am an &#8216;American&rsquo; and I hold no love for this morbid nation at all! I am for an all white nation in the Pacific Northwest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just wondering, how long do you think it would take for nonwhites to try and enter that &#8220;all white nation in the Pacific Northwest,&#8221; that you advocate? How long before what remained of this multicultural and &#8220;morbid nation,&#8221; tried to force that new &#8220;all white nation&#8221; to accept them in along with Mexico and Canada, and God only knows who else on the world stage, like the EU or that Red fools&rsquo; parde that is the UN?</p>
<p>That is just something to ponder. </p>
<p>And finally to Mr. Greg Johnson, regarding:</p>
<p>1.) &#8220;The chances of bringing together a group like that sufficient to take back the whole United States strikes me as minimal. And if it did coalesce, then it would have to face the question of where to put 100 million nonwhites, some populations of which were here before we were.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I have noted above, the USA remains about 65% white and we are entering into uncertain times to be sure, with the current jackass pack in the White House and the US Congress. It is neither &#8220;empty bravado&#8221; or unreasonable to speculate that a significant white backlash could begin to form in this country, that has had enough of the Marxist/multicultural &#8220;ideal.&#8221; With such a popular backlash, you could see a serious &#8220;restructuring&#8221; (or even the implosion) of the current rainbow: political, media, and business establishments&rsquo; triad and the beginnings of a white &#8220;Reconquest&#8221; movement.</p>
<p>Along with this, overtime, it would not be impossible to end nonwhite immigration into the USA, or establish conduct and population restrictions on the 100 million of them currently living here as well. It would also remain essentially a country based on freedom of choice and thus, a significant number of them could voluntarily leave, if they found our race&rsquo;s new standards and laws &#8220;intolerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is as equally possible as speculating that:</p>
<p>&#8220;The breakup of the United States would make help with both of these problems. Imagine that the US federal government collapsed like those of the USSR or Yugoslavia, and sovereignty reverted to the individual states. There would be a number of newly-sovereign states with virtually all-white populations&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Both of our questions/solutions ask a rather large &#8220;if&#8221; Mr. Johnson, and within that &#8220;if&#8221; are an even greater number of permutations and/or evolutions. </p>
<p>All the best to all of you,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

			<p>      Jupiter-It&rsquo;s a done deal friend. Our local Global Elite<br>
have already handed over the Southwest to Mexico. The Chinese<br>
have already created a strong beach head on the West Coast. You<br>
better hope they start fighting each other because no one is go-<br>
ing help the Whites if they don&rsquo;t help themselves. It really is<br>
much simpler to go someplace White and keep it that way than to<br>
try to turn back the clock. </p>

			<p>Again, I am pleased to see that merely announcing this contest already has people thinking and talking about the pros and cons of secession for ensuring the future of the white race on this continent. </p>
<p>I have several comments. </p>
<p>First, as to the charges that secession or taking back America as a whole are utopian pipe-dreams, I think that clearly secession is more likely to save our race than keeping the US intact and somehow taking it over and rectifying its policies. </p>
<p>But beyond that, none of us should be intimidated by the charge of utopian dreaming, since most of what happens in human affairs was first imagined or &#8220;dreamed&#8221; by someone. We are not going to save our race without imagining concrete, workable alternatives to the system that is killing us. The world is full of naysayers, so there is no need to install one in your own head, to stifle your imagination and strangle your brainchildren in the cradle.</p>
<p>Second, secession will probably not be feasible if the US Federal government is at full strength. But it might happen if the central government is paralyzed by an overwhelming crisis or series of crises. Governments fail all the time. A rather large number have failed in the past century. The most spectacular collapses in recent history are the USSR and Yugoslavia. A little further back, we have the collapse of the British, French, Portuguese, and Dutch colonial empires. Before that, we saw the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, German, and Russian empires. </p>
<p>Third, a glance at the results of the recent presidential election broken down county by county are quite remarkable. The Democratic areas of the country are far smaller than the Republican. The largest concentrations of non-whites map out almost exactly on the majority Democrat counties. If white America were simply to slough off those areas, somewhat like Malaysia simply cut loose Singapore with its Chinese majority, whites would retain the vast majority of the US landmass, including the vast majority of its natural resources and watersheds. </p>
<p>Fourth, wouldn&rsquo;t it have been a wonderful world if New England went through with its threats of secessions before the Civil War? When Bush II was re-elected, I remember Democrats whining that the Blue states should secede. My reaction was: Let them! Because the same liberals would be calling for nuclear war if the red states secede, lest they discriminate against some of their pets. If white nationalism actually begins to gain some traction in the country, perhaps the non-whites, liberals, etc. will take their toys and secede from us. A beatific vision!</p>
<p>Finally, to the charge that secession is treason: My race is my nation, not the United States. The United States is a system that is killing my race. Loyalty to that system is treason to the race. <br>

			<p>&#8220;Why not figuratively liquidate the regime (or let it liquidate itself), repudiate the debt, and start from scratch? Why not seize the fortunes that have been made by dismantling the our industrial economy, and use it to recapitalize local industry? Why not create a host of new nations with greater racial homogeneity and more manageable sizes? Why not let the vast urban colonies of liberal whites and their pet non-whites fend for themselves, as independent city states?</p>
<p>I see no reason for piety over the Constitution. We can come up with a better one. White people create ordered liberty like blacks create chaos and tyranny: it is in our genes. Besides, the Constitution did nothing to prevent us from arriving at the present situation. If we were merely to turn back the clock 200 years, our descendants would be in the same mess 200 years from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>(End quote) </p>
<p>&#8216;Next American Revolution,&rsquo; as to your first paragraph. Until we name the name and call the blame for those that gave us fractional reserve banking in the first place, we can NEVER &#8216;start from scratch&rsquo;. Strangely enough, that unwillingness to call as &#8220;Other&#8221; that first group, is guaranteed us by the second paragraph of your comment, in which you say the Constitution is not worth saving. </p>
<p>Hardly. If we had followed the proscriptions given us by the Founding Fathers over matters such as gold and silver coinage, and allowing Congress to do her job, as well as the concept (enduring) of &#8216;3/5ths a person&rsquo; before Lincoln&rsquo;s megalomania, we would never have gotten to this mess in the first place! Emancipation and a Central Bank were never features envisioned by Washington, Adams, Jefferson, etc.!</p>
<p>However, i will say, that for such tepid talking as goes on at this site, the fact that the &#8216;Obamanation&rsquo; has woken up a bunch of you sleepers, is verified by the fact that such honesty as this one entry displays, would never have been seen, before last November!</p>
<p>For that much, God bless you all, who are of the race that calls upon the name of the Lord, and His Messiah. You know who you are&hellip;.now if you can just see who are Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;handlers,&rsquo; we might be on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>Here is the blueprint for reclamation:</p>
<p>1)complete shut own of immgration,right down to 0</p>
<p>2)mass deportation of illegal aliens</p>
<p>3)Get rid of the muslims</p>
<p>4)get rid of the Indian,Chinese and Pakistan an fifth column. This includes most of the Indian,Pakistan and Chinese fifth column. If asians are perceived as working aggressively to advance their racial interests at the expense of Native Born White interests-under the right circunstances-they will be encourged to leave.</p>
<p>On 9/11, the lid of civility came off White America. The asians were terrified. They were terrified of being rounded up and deported. Their terror was justified. Native Born White Americans were in such a nasty mood that it freaked out the Bush administration. The Bush admistration acted fast to stem the massive tide of zenophobia. Right after 9/11, the Bush adminstration brought dozens of leaders from the muslim community to do photo ops with Jorge Bush. This was Bush&rsquo;s attempt to embrace the muslim community as fellow Americans. The Bush adminstration was very lucky. If one of American Airline jets had slammed into Indian point power plant along the Hudson, the backlash against muslims and asians would have been unstopable.</p>
<p>In the weeks after 9/11 there was also a  vicious backlash against asians. At tech companies, hindus were recieving vicious anonymous hate mail from their Native Born White coworkers. The hindus were so traumatized by this, that the tech companies were forced to hire clinical psychologists to counsel the traumatized hindus.</p>
<p>The lid of civility came off very briefly on 9/11. Under the right circumstances, it will impossible to put the lid back on.</p>
<p>There is enormous pent up rage and anger towards asians and muslims in America. Secession is surrunder. It is also foolish. I will not sit down repesentatives from  from the hispanic,asian,muslim and african community to dicuss the terms of surreender. I want a very large ocean between America and&hellip;china,india,pakistan,the muslim world and korea.</p>

			<p>If you have ever voted for the Republican party, you voted for the death of Native Born White America. No excuses for foolishness.</p>
<p>Both Ron Paul and the Libertarians are on on board with the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. For the kook Ron Paul and his fellow Libertarians, America is reducible to free market transactions. Very strange characters, aren&rsquo;t they.</p>
