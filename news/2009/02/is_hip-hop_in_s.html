<h1>Is Hip-Hop in Seattle Being White-Washed?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Cunningham, Seattle Weakly, February 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just like electric blues  &mdash;  another historically black art form which morphed into rock and roll  &mdash;  hip-hop reaches a vastly broader, and whiter, audience than ever before. The difference in Seattle is that some of the most recognizable figures are by and large non-black: Blue Scholars, Common Market, Jake One, Mad Rad, and the Saturday Knights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that makes rappers like Blak concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really do believe the Northwest is not going to push strong black men in hip-hop,&#8221; Blak says [Silas Blak, ne Mark Washington]. &#8220;I just don&rsquo;t believe the message is welcome, or that the image is welcome. In Washington, the darker the face gets, the taller the boundaries are [within music]. My question is: Why is so much black talent in hip-hop getting passed over right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important question, especially since it&rsquo;s not often asked in public forums. That&rsquo;s part of the reason Denee McCloud of the Central District Forum for Arts and Ideas, a community think tank for issues concerning Seattle&rsquo;s African American population, recently organized a panel discussion to open up dialogue on the subject.</p>
<p>In a two-hour symposium Thursday night entitled &#8220;The Black Face of Hip-Hop,&#8221; McCloud is bringing together key figures in the urban arts community to talk about the subject. In her eyes, it&rsquo;s something that needs to happen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because Seattle&rsquo;s hip-hop community is multiracial, there are various artists of color who gain acclaim, but at the moment the majority of them (with the exception of Dyme Def) are not black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blak, who is also one of the panelists, agrees with that. &#8220;It&rsquo;s hard to put a finger on the problem,&#8221; Blak says. &#8220;We never had a conversation when the brothers and the white guys actually sat down in one room and told the truth &hellip; about venues charging different prices for hip-hop artists to play versus rock artists &hellip; and everything. That&rsquo;s what I hope can come out of it: the truth. I know Dave Meinert, and I think he&rsquo;s a good guy. My question for Dave is: Why did you stop at Blue Scholars and say, &#8216;Here&rsquo;s my money?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meinert says that assumption isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t go out and try to manage any hip-hop group,&#8221; Meinert says. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t approach Blue Scholars or Common Market, they approached me. I&rsquo;d work with anybody, but I also can only do so much. The reason I&rsquo;ve stopped taking on other artists is to be focused.&#8221;</p>
<p>George &#8220;Geo&#8221; Quibuyen, the lead vocalist of Blue Scholars, is conscious that his ethnicity, Filipino, sets him apart from black rappers in Seattle, and doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to admit that&rsquo;s benefited his group&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quibuyen&rsquo;s musical partner, Sabzi, is of Iranian descent. Blue Scholars have toured nationally, released music videos on MTVU, and regularly get booked to play festivals like Sasquatch and Bumbershoot while local black hip-hop acts such as Spaceman, Orbitron, and D. Black are left off the bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In one way, it really misses the point to lay blame on individuals like us when it&rsquo;s a systemic problem,&#8221; Geo adds. &#8220;The mainstream expectations for hip-hop outside of Seattle are this archaic notion of an urban black face. And we don&rsquo;t fit that. So we&rsquo;re locked out too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terry Radjaw, of the all-white party-rap group Mad Rad, also has mixed feelings on the subject. After a blitzkrieg of local press  &mdash;  both good and bad, based on the group&rsquo;s controversial antics  &mdash;  Mad Rad has emerged as yet another non-black group snagging the limelight at the moment. And Radjaw knows his group has its detractors based on race alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just look at the people who are supporting [hip-hop] now versus in the past,&#8221; Radjaw says. &#8220;More so now, it seems that the white community is showing the most support, going to shows, buying records, etc. But I feel like age has more of an effect on certain shows that people go to than race does now. When I go out, I find young white kids and older black folks at hip-hop shows. Most black folks I see are the 35-year-olds &hellip; and why that is, I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This has parallels to disco   &mdash;   Most disco singers and groups were black, but if you ask the average person to associate a person or group with disco, most of them will say The Bee Gees.  And to think, the Bee Gees came to America in 1967 as a Beatles knockoff, the disco thing they fell into by happenstance.  They became the kings of Disco, over and above the black individuals and groups that dedicated themselves to the genre.</p>

			<p>Blues was not invented out of thin air by blacks. It is almost solely based on the &#8216;blues scale,&rsquo; which is a variation of the minor pentatonic scale. These are scales that are part of the musical tradition of the West, not Africa. So we&rsquo;re always lectured on the fact that &#8216;blues turned into rock n&rsquo; roll&rsquo; but we are never informed that &#8216;blues&rsquo; evolved from a black interpretation of traditional white folk music. </p>

			<p>After hair metal died in the late eighties, and grunge emerged as an emo, socially conscious art form, hip-hop and rap had the monopoly on subversive music.  That is why white kids made it popular in the nineties.</p>
<p>The last white kids who still think black music is cool must live in the Northwest.</p>

			<p> Blacks did not invent Rock &#8220;n&#8221; Roll, that is another <br>
stupid Afro-centric myth. And judging by the way they<br>
constantly must sample Rock songs for use in Rap <br>
songs, how can blacks claim Rap as black music ? As far <br>
as im concerned blacks can keep degenerate rap. It is <br>
tasteless and talentless. </p>

			<p>Why is rap even still in mainstream?  Every musical fad in the history of this nation has come and gone in the span of 3-4 years but rap has been with us since the mid 90s.  I&rsquo;ve never been a fan but I find it hard to believe that White kids don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s stale and passe by now.  </p>

			<p>I can think of a lot of things that were historically white (such as science, medicine, engineering, philanthropy, poetry, classical music, most sports, electronics, telecommunications etc. etc.) and yet, when blacks encroach on those things - the hostile elite applaud!  So, according to the hostile elite, it&rsquo;s a good thing for black things to remain black but a bad thing for white things to remain white.  A double standard if there ever was one.  As for hip hop, I agree with Dr. Caligari.  It&rsquo;s tasteless and degenerate and they can keep it.</p>

<p>It was just coming out toward the late 80s but it was something only blacks listened to.  I&rsquo;m not trying to trash black music, some of it was actually good when it sounded like 80s classic rock but rap has always been nothing but garbage.  Not to mention that all the rappers in the songs seem to have the same voice and the same beat. I think they keep promoting well past it&rsquo;s expiration date because it promotes degeneracy. Liberalism is all about fooling people.  For all we know liberals might be buying the CDs and throwing them in the trash just to keep money flowing into the business and fool the White kids.  </p>

<p>&gt; Here&rsquo;s something that will perhaps stick in your throat, it was actually Jewish influence that caused blues and Jazz.  Ashkenazi Klezmer music has all those notes, sounds and forms you mention in abundance.  Before the late 19th century Jewish immigration, popular American music was pretty much about Stephen Foster.  Vaudevile was invented by Jews in NYC.  But it was the combo of White Folk with Jewish Folk and the African rhythum infused into French Folk music that influenced all popular music in the 20th century.  The term &#8220;Rock and Roll&#8221; in fact comes from the way Blacks would &#8220;rock&#8221; while they sung and &#8220;roll&#8221; on the floor in religious frenzies in Church.  And the banjo is irrefutably an African instrument - even though it was much more developed in America. But Blacks would be nowhere musically without Western musical notation all the European invented and developed musical instruments they used.  As far as dance is concerned, Black borrowed Irish and other step-dancing and clogging, which became tap dancing for example, just as they copied the Irish/Celtic style of singing with the emotionally sustained note bending that has become so exaggerated and hackneyed in America in the past 40 years.   </p>

			<p>A quick search on the web will reveal that sales for rap dropped 30% in 2006 and 35% in 2007. Why is the media still trying to force it down white&rsquo;s collective throats as if it&rsquo;s still popular or at least more popular than it really is?  </p>

			<p>Hip-Hop is the first musical genre that was and is consciously and relentlessly promoted by the greater Entertainment-Industrial-Complex. Unlike nearly all other musical genres, Hip-Hop gained widespread acceptance because it was &#8220;popular,&#8221; rather than becoming popular because it was so widely accepted. In other words, it has been literally SOLD to America&rsquo;s youth as the cool/hip/popular music of the day, often to the exclusion of all other music. MTV almost single-handedly created so-called Hip-Hop culture(music, dance, clothing, etc.)peddling &#8220;urban&#8221; music to America&rsquo;s young people, while essentially ignoring traditionally White genres like Hard-Rock and Heavy-Metal.  <br>

			<p>Whiteplight, the Arabs claim they invented (at least forerunner to) the banjo and that the claims of W. Africans stating they invented it are as realistic as stories that purport that black Africans designed and built the pyramids. I don&rsquo;t know it the Arab&rsquo;s claim is true, but it seems possible to me given what we&rsquo;ve seen from blacks in Africa and the US.</p>

			<p>As a sideline note, I&rsquo;ll bet a lot of readers don&rsquo;t realize that paradoxically, a White group called Blondie(lead singer Deborah Harry; boy was she some nice eye candy back in the day!) sang rap - and were early to do so - in the early 80&rsquo;s with a song called &#8220;Rapture&#8221;. </p>

&#8220;Just like electric blues &mdash; another historically black art form which morphed into rock and roll&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The very first sentence, and already there are problems. </p>
<p>If electric blues are an historically black art form, does that imply that blacks invented electricity? Are we to believe that the Bushmen of the Kalahari were plugging Fender Stratocasters into Marshall amps and wailing away about &#8220;dat no-good cheatin&rsquo; woman&#8221; and &#8220;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to Chicago&#8221; and so on, before the first slave ships showed up? </p>
<p>Seems to me claims of African invention and achievement come in two types: (1) outright falsehoods (&#8220;Africa invented Democracy!&#8221;, &#8220;A black man invented Air Conditioning!&#8221; and so on); and (2) those &#8220;inventions&#8221; which could not have come about without MANY more significant white inventions preceding them. </p>
<p>You know: trivial little white inventions like electricity, amplification, stringed instruments, musical scales, musical notation, song structure, rhyme schemes, the English language, etc, etc, etc&hellip; </p>
<p>In short: blacks would be LOST without us. Completely and utterly LOST. </p>
<p>We, on the other hand, could get along just fine without them. </p>

<p>Because they want America defined by a common culture in support of multiculturalism and they don&rsquo;t want that culture to be White.  That&rsquo;s why rock and roll and pop music aren&rsquo;t promoted in the media anymore.  Just check out MTV to see what I&rsquo;m talking about.  Even though sales of rap are declining every year and the majority of Whites have never listened to rap anyhow, the power of the media is being used to promote it as mainstream.  Unless the monopoly of the entertainment industry is broken I suspect rap will still be promoted as the in thing 20 years from now.   </p>
