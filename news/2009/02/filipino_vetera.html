<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/us/politics/17vets.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1">Filipino Veterans Benefit in Stimulus Bill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bernie Becker, New York Times, Feb. 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Filipino veterans of World War II, on a six-decade quest for benefits from the federal government, have found them in an unlikely place: the stimulus package that was passed on Friday.</p>
<p>Congressional supporters and the remaining veterans  &mdash;  about 18,000 out of some 250,000  &mdash;  lauded a $198 million provision that will give lump-sum payments of $15,000 to Filipino veterans who are American citizens and $9,000 to those who are noncitizens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Filipino veterans, who had been placed under American command during World War II, had expected to receive the same pensions and benefits as American soldiers once the war ended. Instead, the government granted benefits only to a small number of them.</p>
<p>Supporters of the provision, originally inserted by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, said that they did not expect the payments to do much to stimulate the economy, but that it was a way to bypass opponents who had blocked payments in the past.</p>

			<p>I have no problem with this. They fought for America back when there was one&hellip; What I do worry about is all the artifacts and relics and talismans of American History. What happens to them when there is no more America? And what will the history books say about it after it happens?</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a big problem with Filipino Vets and health care fraud.</p>
<p>Many of them feign illnesses with crooked doctors who pad the bill then file bogus claims against the Military Tricare Health Plan. The Doctor gives a kick back to the Veteran patient and they both scam the system.   </p>
<p>The scam had gotten so out of control that Tricare had lowered medical payouts for those living in the Philippines, to less then what Veteran living in the States would receive.</p>

			<p>The real mistake was America acquiring the Phillipinnes in the first place. Had this not happened this would not have happened. I can even make a case that the war with Japan might not have happened had America not over-reached so far into the Pacific. The Spanish-American war was wrong, needless and a mistake. </p>

No problem? Take it to its logical conclusion.  In Iraq we have around 150,000 contractors &#8220;fighting&#8221; for the U.S., and many are foreigners earning considerably less than their American counterparts.  So a fews years down the road, our children and grandchildren will have to pay compensation to them because they &#8220;fought for the United States.&#8221;<br>
Filipinos are getting paid 65 years later for fighting to reclaim Their homeland from Japanese, in a U.S. bill that has nothing to do with that issue.  I have a serious problem with that, and the lack of forsight exhibited by the previous comments.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t mind seeing these men who fought for the (former) US being compensated. I don&rsquo;t think the money should be included with the idiotic (non) Stimulus Package. It should be taken from the dollars being Hoovered from taxpayers and handed over to illegals from South of our former border and everywhere else. </p>

			<p>my only objection is that its hidden in a stimulus bill. they should put it in a separate bill so the contributions of our filipino friends can be recognized. ive got big respect for the filipinos who fought alongside americans in ww2.</p>

			<p>They fought the Japanese yes, but it was America that fought for them.</p>
<p>Our troops died to liberate the Philippines.  They helped us free their country.  The blood our soldiers shed was enough payment.</p>
<p>Do we also owe the Chinese compensation, Australians, New Zealanders, how about the French Resistance fighters?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for this type of propaganda.  </p>
<p>The compensation should come from their own country&rsquo;s coffers.</p>
<p>The US does not owe the world a payoff just because they do what is right and in their own best interest.</p>

			<p>My Father was in the US Navy in 1944. He made up part of the massive US Invasion Force that<br>
chased the Japanese out of the Philippines during the hard fighting in the Pacific of that year.<br>
After the Japanese left, he did a brief spell of shore<br>
patrol in Manila. In September, 1945 he pulled shore patrol in Tokyo. My Father was an Italian guy,<br>
born in East Harlem, NYC of immigrant parents.<br>
From 1945 until his death in 2005 he received not one dime in VA benefits, except for the GI Bill payments<br>
he got at the time of his discharge.<br>
After his death, his survivors were entitled to mark his grave with a small government-issued tombstone<br>
and that was it   &mdash;  - not one dime in death benefits.<br>
What makes the Filipino Vets so special? Could it be race?<br>
Go ask Obamarama ( no US Birth Certificate in existence )<br>
and the Democrats.</p>

<p>I agree with this. Quite a lot of Philippine people are in the U.S. Navy and Marines, and I have worked with them in the field in Iraq. I came to appreciate the people and would like to visit there. They are one of the few countries in which we (white Americans) are still welcomed with no restrictions, yet they have trouble coming to the U.S. and are treated as hostile aliens!!! it&rsquo;s the muslims, Pakis, Hindis and central American riff raff that should be stopped from coming into the U.S.</p>

			<p>Our treatment of our Philipino brothers in arms has been almost as bad as how we treated the Indians and far worse than how we treated blacks. The best thing that  ever happened to African Americans was when one of their relatives sold them to the white man.<br>
     For evey US born soldier who was beaten, bayonetted, and brutalized to death on the Death March by the fiends from Tokyo, 7 Philipinos perished. When Manila was about to be liberated the Japs, murdered over 100,000 people for no reason at all.<br>
     We did turn their country into the US Navy`s cat house at Olongopo, Subic bay. We kept a continual supply of Philipino girls feeding the flesh pit for over 10 years. More than 500,000 Philipino girls were debauched by our government`s policy of providing whores. These girls were supporting entire families and more than 150,000 half castes were the end result.<br>
     We should be forced to get down on our knees and kiss everybody`s rear end on the entire 2500 Island Archepeligo.<br>
I am a bit of a fanatic on this subject, maybe it is because my uncle fought in the battle of the ball park and when the fighting was over spent three weeks burying bodies, Amercian and Philipino.<br>

<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t care to read a history book, would you? The Philippines were an American protectorate, to be sure. But the Japanese, kindly, loving, peacful people that they were&hellip; enslaved the native Filipinos. Raping, looting, butchering at will! Oops, sorry. I don&rsquo;t think Japan likes to be reminded of its own historic flaws.</p>
<p>Filipinos did not necessarily fight for America as much as for their own freedom from tyranical Japanese overlords. Given a lot of American blood was spilled for the purpose of wresting the Philippine Islands from their Japanese conquerors&hellip; that claim is at best, a half-truth!</p>
<p>I am not knocking the Filipinos. Simply pointing out they hardly deserve that hand-out given millions of Americans got no special funds for being WWII veterans other than some educational benefits. I am sorry, but I am getting damned tired of half-truths and lies posted on this site.</p>

<p> You are missing the big picture. The United States should never have been there IN THE FIRST PLACE. Had America not fought Spain in a bullying senseless war, none of the things you say would have happened to America or been its problem. </p>

			<p>The US liberated Philippines at tremendous human cost to our nation.  Yes it was in our self-interest, but it was in their even more so.  Compensating another nation&rsquo;s soldiers, or in this case its guerillas, seems madness.  It was the US that assisted to liberate them.  Further we allowed many to become full citizens after the war.  The benefits are endless and the appreciation little.</p>

<p>The Philippine Islands didn&rsquo;t HAVE a coffer for years since the Marcos&rsquo; ran off with it and WE, the U.S. helped them do so.</p>

<p> Why was that? America lived for centuries with the Dutch East Indies. Why would Japan acquiring some colonial posessions have mattered? The USA should have avoided its drive into the Pacific at the turn of the last century. War with Japan could easily have been avoided. </p>

			<p>Funny, I thought the Phillipino soldiers fought for themselves, to free there island from Japan - not for the US.  In fact, it is the US that fought for them.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re saying thaty we didn&rsquo;t help Marcos run off with the treasury when he came here in exile?</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much Marcos stole, and I don&rsquo;t doubt that he came to the U.S.  I&rsquo;m just pointing out that the Chinese minority in the Phillipines, about 2 % if I recall correctly, own the place.  Marcos money is only the amount that he could skim off the Chinese.  The fact remains, the great bulk of the wealth of the Phillipines is owned by Chinese, not by the Marcos family.  If the Filipinos want money, let them get it back from their minority masters.  </p>
