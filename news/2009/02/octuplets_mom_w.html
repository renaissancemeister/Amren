			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KTLA-TV (Los Angeles), February 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mother of the octuplets born a week ago is apparently hoping to cash in by selling her story.</p>
<p>On Friday, 33-year-old Nadya Suleman retained the Killeen Futney Group public relations firm to handle the offers for book deals, TV shows and other opportunities that the firm claims are pouring in.</p>
<p>Now, the British Newspaper &#8216;The Telegraph&rsquo; said Suleman wants to get $2 million from whoever interviews her first.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said she wants to get help from a corporate sponsor, such as a diaper company.</p>
<p>Suleman also wants to launch a new career as a television child care expert, The Telegraph reported.</p>
<p>The mother of 14 graduated from Cal State Fullerton in 2006 with a bachelor of science degree in child and adolescent development, school officials said.</p>
<p>She returned to pursue a master&rsquo;s in counseling, but last attended in the spring of 2008.</p>
<p>Kileen said Suleman is &#8220;the most sought after mom in the world right now,&#8221; but that she hasn&rsquo;t decided what she&rsquo;ll do next, other than care for her children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Their mother could be allowed to return home in a few days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She and her children live with her mother in a 1,550-square-foot home in Whittier, and her father has been working in Iraq as a translator to help support the family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be difficult,&#8221; she [Angela Suleman] said, adding that her daughter&rsquo;s father is going back to his native Iraq, where neighbors said he works as a contractor, to help support the family.</p>
<p>He told reporters that he is a former Iraqi military man.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Jessica Garrison and Kimi Yoshino, Los Angeles Times, January 31, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Nadya Suleman&rsquo;s goal in life was to be a mother, her friends and family said. That is why, even with a brood of six, including 2-year-old twins, she decided to have more embryos transferred in hopes, her mother said Friday, of getting &#8220;just one more girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And look what happened. Octuplets. Dear God,&#8221; Angela Suleman said four days after her 33-year-old daughter became the second person in the U.S. ever to give birth to eight babies at once.</p>
<p>Suleman stressed that her daughter &#8220;is not evil, but she is obsessed with children. She loves children, she is very good with children, but obviously she overdid herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela Suleman said all the children are from the same sperm donor, but she did not identify him. Her daughter is divorced, but Suleman said the ex-husband was not the father.</p>
<p>Suleman said she is caring for her six grandchildren while their mother is in the hospital recovering. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Friends and family also reported that Nadya Suleman worked as a psychiatric technician until she was injured on the job. Then she began having children and enrolled in school.</p>
<p>She graduated from Cal State Fullerton in 2006 with a bachelor of science degree in child and adolescent development, school officials said. She returned to pursue a master&rsquo;s in counseling, but last attended in the spring of 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She and her children live with her mother in a 1,550-square-foot home in Whittier, and her father has been working in Iraq as a translator to help support the family.</p>
<p>In 2008, Angela Suleman filed for bankruptcy, claiming nearly $1 million in liabilities mostly due to a bad housing investment, her bankruptcy attorney said. Suleman said Friday that she had withdrawn the filing and paid her debts.</p>

<p>I knew it. I knew that was what this would lead to. Everything in the U.S. is about smoke and mirrors. Everything is about focusing on the abnormal for fun and profit. There may be one consolation in all of this if she gets the 20million, it will come from stupid Nationa Enquirer readers and other airheads who spend their time reading gossip.</p>

			<p>Someone should carefully check the outgoing news on the Council of Conservative Citizens website each day before it is published. Almost daily, I find numerous mistakes involving spelling, grammar, and diction. </p>
<p>Terms such as &#8220;there&#8221;, &#8220;their&#8221; and &#8220;they&rsquo;re&#8221; are often interchanged. Today, &#8220;Chief&#8221; is spelled as &#8220;Cheif&#8221;. I read the page daily and find the mistakes to be routine. It is quite embarrassing for our cause, and it could fuel the &ldquo;dumb hick redneck&rdquo; fodder from our enemies and detractors.</p>
<p>I thought you should know.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br>

			<p>Of course she will be applying for benifits. I would make them contingent on her being fitted with a contraceptive device. If she continues to have children, place them in an orphanage.</p>

			<p>This whole thing is a disgrace!!! She should be ashamed of herself and the doctors who may have helped in this mess should be thrown out of the medical profession&hellip;shame on all of them. She had these children in order for US to pay for them, and for profit&hellip;.I say if she is on welfare she should be taken off immediatly&hellip;I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO PAY FOR THESE BRATS!!!

			<p>Well, needless to say, the articles don&rsquo;t tell you what race she is. So I decided to look up the city of Whittier on the Census Bureau web site. Here&rsquo;s what I found: 56.6% White, 0.8% black, 64.2% Hispanic. Considering the family name doesn&rsquo;t sound Hispanic, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re probably White (maybe somebody in California can confirm this). If so, this isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, even if the mother is obsessed. Our birth rate is too low in comparison.</p>

			<p>Why is this everybody&rsquo;s business?  I don&rsquo;t know this woman, and she is a rare one if she can handle 14 children.  That much is true.  Yet Child Protective Services has no apparent problem with her.  She couldn&rsquo;t qualify for donar sperm if she were raising these children with no means of support; right? Eight at once is extreme, but she could have ended up with 14 children with some idiot or idiots with high sex drives and low intelligence and no sense of responibility if she had conceived them in the traditional way. </p>
<p>Quite frankly I am in favor of regulating who can reproduce, even if it means that I can&rsquo;t have the children that I would like to have.  While I understand how eugenics got a bad reputation, I am in favor of laboratory conceptions because the state has an interest in stopping genetic conditions.  People cannot be counted upon to stop themselves while their hormones are jumping.  I don&rsquo;t have a problem with sterilizations before puberty and reversing them for people prepared to be responsible parents.  I just don&rsquo;t, even though I realize that I might be found to be on the wrong side of that line, which I would not like.      </p>

			<p> A friend of mine who is a retired physician and who has delivered more than 5,000 babies told me that for a doctor to implant a woman with that many eggs is the height of irresponsibility and is unethical. He suggested that the doctor or doctors responsible may face disciplinary action by the California Medical Association.</p>
<p> But take a look at the photo of the three doctors who apparently were responsible: an Indian and two American blacks, one female, one male. Can you say, &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221; if the CMA tries to sanction these three disgraces to the medical profession? Plus, the fact that the woman is apparently a Palestinian Arab will also give the bleeding hearts plenty of ammunition, too.</p>

			<p>      These new children are costing hundreds of thousands of<br>
dollars a day. And they may need special care for years-or for-<br>
ever. No one has that kind of insurance. To care for them will<br>
take not a small fortune, but a large one. Why do I get the feel-<br>
ing that we are going to be paying for her sick, selfish obses-<br>
sion? And if she gets away with it, others will do the same. <br>
Frankenstein was a benign monster compared to this women and her<br>
brood.</p>

			<p>This story is illustrates the insanity going on in California and the utter abuse of its taxpayers who have already paid for the services required by this women. In a different but essentially related story involving the abuse fo taxpayers, an illegal alien female student is going to UCLA at taxpayers expense. The abuse of California&rsquo;s legal citizenry is constant, non-stop and extreme. How many American citizen and legal students have been turned away from UCLA in the past that were easily as qualified as this foreign illegal national? A seat has been taken from a qualified citizen by an illegal foreign national. It&rsquo;s too much and it will get worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot see circumstances where any reasonable physician would transfer [so many] embryos into a woman under the age of 35 under any circumstance,&#8221; said Arthur Wisot, a fertility doctor in Redondo Beach and the author of &#8220;Conceptions and Misconceptions.&#8221;</p>

			<p>There are some mis-conceptions going on here.  Please read the article fully before commenting. If not, just as the previous commentor stated:  &#8220;it could fuel the &ldquo;dumb hick redneck&rdquo; fodder from our enemies and detractors&#8221;.  This woman is not married, she is divorced.  The man she is divorced from has a hispanic sounding surname, but NONE of the children are his.  She used a sperm donor, and a VERY un-ethical doctor.  She may very well have traveled into Mexico to have the procedures done.  That is speculation.  The mother&rsquo;s father is Iraqi, and claims to be a former Iraqi military man.  He now works as a contractor in Iraq to help support the family.  There has been no comment on the nationality of the mother&rsquo;s mother, but she claims her daughter is crazy.  She also says she will not stay in the home and help her once she comes home from the hospital.  The mother&rsquo;s parents are divorced, but live in the same home.  The mother of these 14 children is college educated, but un-employed.   </p>

<p>Wayne:</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the AA argument (although valid) the doctors in question had nothing to do with the idiocy of implanting multiple fetesus in a woman who already had six children, no husband, and no job.</p>
<p>This is all over talk radio here in California (the only source of legitimate news besides the Internet).</p>
<p>This woman was referred from another clinic to Kaiser  &mdash;  I believe she showed up on their doorstep when she was 23 weeks pregnant. Of course, Kaiser could not turn her away due to federal laws that require they treat her.  The Kaiser doctors stated that they wanted her to selectively abort but she refused.</p>
<p>She spent the next seven weeks at Kaiser (imagine the cost) until she delivered.  There were 42 doctors in the delivery room.<br>
The babies, obviously, were born very small, some weighing in the one-pound range.</p>
<p>I read that it&rsquo;s going to cost Kaiser in the area of four million dollars to provide NICU care for the eight super-preemie babies.  Do you think this single woman has enough insurance to cover all the expenses?  </p>
<p>Kaiser has already announced that they expect a rate increase of around 14% next year.  </p>
<p>As a member of Kaiser, this burns me up to no end as I am certain my insurance premiums will go up  &mdash;  all for something with which I profoundly disagree (14 children with no father, no job).</p>
<p>Callers to John &amp; Ken&rsquo;s radio show have stated that the six other children were also born through IVF and at least two or three of them have disabilities. The new children will likely be disabled as well, further burdening the schools with monstrous, life-long costs to educate and take care of them.</p>
<p>This is an outrage and I hope the doctor(s) who stupidly implanted this woman have their medical licenses revoked and are made to pay the medical bills incurred by these children.</p>

<p>This is a horrible situation.  You&rsquo;ve got 14 children living in a 3 bedroom house.  The State is always interferring in citizens business - I think the State should step in and tell this woman that there is no way she is going to be able to feed and care for 14 children and that the octuplets will be put up for adoption.  I&rsquo;ll bet there are ALOT of really nice couples out there who would rush for the chance to adopt these poor little babies.</p>

			<p>There should be laws preventing such things. Doctors should not be allowed to inseminate a woman via IVF with more than two children. <br>
But there&rsquo;s more to it. No woman could properly care for 8 children at once, I don&rsquo;t care who she is or how what kind of resources she has. It would be nearly impossible to provide the type of affection, love and care that newborns need at birth and during the first few years. The fact that she already has 6 children tells me that this woman has mental problems. <br>
This woman is like some animal who just shot out a litter  &mdash;  only she doesn&rsquo;t have enough nipples for them to suck on.  </p>

			<p>I am all for offering her the $2 million for her side of the story as long as that money is not paid to her but the hospital bill first. Next on the list is a refund of all the taxpayer money she and her family have scrounged in the past. There will not be a penny left after that, if there is use it for return tickets to<br>
Iraq. </p>

<p>She&rsquo;d still be in the hole.  They&rsquo;ve already calculated that the cost of this is over $3m.  And that&rsquo;s just the &#8220;health&#8221;; it doesn&rsquo;t include the &#8220;welfare&#8221;.<br>

			<p>    Turns out that all her children were the product of IVF treatments.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;d like to know who funded this women getting IVF 6 times and then again for this set of 8 babies?! Average IVF treatment costs $10K per month not including fertility drugs. Something rotten is involved in this scheme and demands investigation. </p>
<p>Of course many IVF mothers are well into their 40&rsquo;s.  She was 26 when she got pregnant with her first.  She&rsquo;s now 33 so it would have easier.  Still, who paid the cost.</p>
<p>Also, how did she belong to Kaiser?  Kaiser is an HMO avaliable only to those enrolled by employers.  I wonder if Kaiser&rsquo;s rates will go up for everyone to pay for the mass production cesearian and the costs of caring for these 1 pound babies for at least a month before they go home.</p>

			<p>The Suleman octuplets&rsquo; medical costs have not been disclosed, but the average cost for just one cesarean birth in 2006 was $22,762 in California. The Suleman babies were born nine weeks premature. In California, a single premature birth in 2006 led to an average hospital stay of 25 days and cost $164,273. </p>
<p>That would amount to a $1.3 million bill for eight. </p>

			<p>&#8220;But take a look at the photo of the three doctors who apparently were responsible: an Indian and two American blacks, one female, one male. Can you say, &ldquo;racial discrimination&rdquo; if the CMA tries to sanction these three disgraces to the medical profession? Plus, the fact that the woman is apparently a Palestinian Arab will also give the bleeding hearts plenty of ammunition, too.&#8221; Posted by Wayne Engle</p>
<p>Those Doctors were not the Doctor or Doctors who implanted the embryos in her.  They were the Doctors who were faced with monitoring the pregnancy and delivering the babies when she managed to get herself into the Kaiser HMO in the second month.</p>
<p>It took 42 people to deliver the babies.  Glad I wasn&rsquo;t having a baby at Kaiser that day.<br>

			<p>Bon, thanks for clarifying exactly how this woman got herself into Kaiser.  I have been wondering myself.  Normally the only way to get into Kaiser is through employer insurance.  You&rsquo;re absolutely right, everybody who belongs to Kaiser will have to pay for those babies&rsquo; extraordinary measures health care.</p>
<p>The neighbors have said that they didn&rsquo;t know how many people live in the house.</p>

			<p>The Grandmother looks like a Northern European anglo saxon type American.  She speaks native American english.  The grandfather speaks very educated excellent english with a  slight accent.</p>
<p>He has said many times that he will provide for the children.  He didn&rsquo;t say how.  He has not only provided his daughter and her 6 kids with a house, he has paid for a nanny.</p>
<p>The poster who conjectured that the Mother traveled to Mexico for the IVF treatments may very well be right.</p>

			<p>All this talk about millions of dollars!<br>
It used to be that having a baby was the most natural thing in the world. In my parent&rsquo;s time, people had their children at home. No expense, no fuss.  And they had large families too.<br>
Maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s ailing us today?</p>

			<p>She&rsquo;s also filed two worker&rsquo;s compensation claims.  So she can&rsquo;t work because she&rsquo;s injured&hellip;and, let&rsquo;s say she only wanted one or two more children to add to the six she already had, (instead of the 14 she now has) then how was she supposed to be injured, twice, and taking care of 7 or 8 children?</p>
