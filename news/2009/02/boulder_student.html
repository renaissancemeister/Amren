	<p>A trio of well-intentioned Boulder High School students said they grossly underestimated the students&rsquo; and the community&rsquo;s reactions to their proposal of renaming their school after President Barack Obama. So they withdrew the idea Thursday afternoon, just 24 hours after floating it into the media.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t anticipate how rapidly this proposal would become so controversial,&#8221; said Ben Raderstorf, a 16-year-old junior and president of the Student Worker Club at Boulder High School. &#8220;We also underestimated the pride that the alumni and faculty have in this school and its rich history.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;But this happened so quickly we didn&rsquo;t have time to give the idea a proper discussion,&#8221; Raderstorf said, adding he got the idea of using the name as a symbol of the hope and inspiration Obama brings to the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The support is clearly not as large as we would have hoped. The students and the community have spoken, and we have no desire to go against their will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meagan Mahaffy, a junior, said, &#8220;It happened so fast. We were bombarded by criticism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emma Marion, also a junior and member of the Student Worker Club, said things got a little ugly within the student body.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were tons of signs that came out, some to get rid of the Student Workers. Some called us Communists. They even held an impromptu school spirit rally,&#8221; she said, pointing to student council president Devin Kuh, standing among reporters wearing a purple and yellow &#8220;Boulder&#8221; sweatshirt.</p>

								<h2>Boulder High Students Back Off Obama Name Change</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Vanessa Miller, Colorado Daily (Boulder), February 12, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>When representatives of a Boulder High student activist group arrived at school Thursday, they were greeted with angry opposition to their proposal to rename the building after President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Many of the activists&rsquo; peers wore Boulder High gear, made posters calling for an end to the Student Worker group, and mocked the notion of a Barack Obama High. By the time of an afternoon news conference, originally called to launch a petition for the name change, Student Worker President Ben Raderstorf had dropped the proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have realized that we made a gross error in our understanding of the significance of the Boulder High School name,&#8221; Raderstorf said to a classroom packed with TV cameras, teachers, students and community members.</p>
<p>Many students said they learned about the proposal on the social networking Web site Facebook, where several people organized an impromptu spirit day Thursday. One of the Facebook pages titled, &#8220;Do NOT change the name of Boulder High School to &#8216;Barack Obama High,&rsquo;&#8221; had nearly 600 members.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is ridiculous to throw away over 100 years of tradition simply because of Obama-mania,&#8221; the group&rsquo;s organizer wrote.</p>
<p>Students chastised the student workers all Thursday  &mdash;  although Raderstorf said he doesn&rsquo;t believe any of the &#8220;threats&#8221; were legitimate. He wouldn&rsquo;t elaborate on what threats he meant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the news conference, student council representatives said their classmates appreciate Obama&rsquo;s accomplishments but oppose taking his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud of our school and feel that a name change would diminish the lengthy and rich history of our school,&#8221; said Devin Kuh, president of the student body.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the issue is tabled for now, Raderstorf encouraged future students to revisit the prospect of renaming the school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Student Worker member Meagan Mahaffy, 16, said the group might focus on getting composting at their school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senior Logan Simpson, 17, said the issue was not only a hot topic in the halls but in the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of our teachers were saying it&rsquo;s ridiculous,&#8221; Simpson said.</p>
<p>But the group&rsquo;s faculty adviser, James Vacca, said he&rsquo;s impressed by the students&rsquo; &#8220;fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shocking, that someone would think that a group with &#8220;workers&#8221; in its name might have Marxian sympathies?  Just as shocking, that anyone thinks these &#8220;student workers&#8221; are actually the latter?</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the telling paragraph excerpt from the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Language arts teacher James Vacca, the faculty sponsor of the Student Workers Club for 10 years, commended the group for trying something new.&#8221;</p>
<p>Typical. Some neo-Marxist hack with an English degree pulling the strings of gullible adolescents.</p>

			<p>These three little neophyte leftists were given an awakening.<br>
&#8220;We also underestimated the pride that the alumni and faculty have in this school and its rich history.&#8221; &#8220;The students and the community have spoken and we have no desire to go against their will.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t, in the setting their in. When they join society and become full fledged grown up leftists, and have all of that powerful backing, it won&rsquo;t be a question of going against other citizens will; just like the leftists in power at the State Capitol in Sacramento California, who today have voted against the citizenrys will, it won&rsquo;t matter a bit to them.</p>

			<p>The Student Workers Club?  This obviously sounds like a Marxist organization.  No wonder they support Obama.  I can&rsquo;t believe the school even allows a group like this.  Would they allow the Student Facists Club?</p>

			<p>About the only praise I can give the 3 students is that they learned quickly.  Here is a fine example of young whites not being properly educated by their parents.  If race is still an issue today, it will be an issue tomorrrow.  White children will be the biggest losers because their white parents are the biggest failures.<br>

<p>They deserve a a little touch of reality.  And they need it too.  I&rsquo;ll bet their parents are some real winners.</p>

<p> Well the name Student Worker group does sound quite red. Also<br>
I am quite sure judging by the photo of these kids, that their<br>
parents are quite the Liberals. Look at the kid in the center<br>
with the red,gold and green shirt and five point star. It&rsquo;s<br>
a safe bet that his parents are ultra Liberal. Also it is<br>
quite asinine to rush and name a school after Obama. Judging <br>
Obama by merit, what the hell has he done to deserve this ?</p>
<p> Besides being another plastic deity of the left.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that people were willing to speak up for their history with pride and not give into this weeks hot new trend.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It is ridiculous to throw away over 100 years of tradition simply because of Obama-mania,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Amen. And it&rsquo;s lucky the kids who proposed this were white. Had they been blacks, they could have screamed &#8216;racism&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>  Poor misinformed, ignorant children. It isn&rsquo;t completely their fault. They&rsquo;ve been bombarded from all sides all their impressionable years with the diversity poison. They just drank a little more of the obama kool-aid than most of their classmates. I just hope they don&rsquo;t end up with mixed children themselves. Thank God for smarter minds prevailing.</p>

			<p>Well, I must say I got a good laugh out of this one, particularly since it is in the People&rsquo;s Republic of Colorado, Boulder Administrative Commiserate. </p>
<p>This line by Young Pioneer Marion, pretty much says it all:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There were tons of signs that came out, some to get rid of the Student Workers. Some called us Communists. They even held an impromptu school spirit rally,&rsquo; she said, pointing to student council president Devin Kuh, standing among reporters wearing a purple and yellow &#8216;Boulder&rsquo; sweatshirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, I must say the photo of the presumptive little junior branch of the NKVD-Boulder-CO was even more amusing. How bewildered the troika of little Red swine look; don&rsquo;t worry Comrades, you will all get into Harvard or Yale when they see how oppressed you three &#8220;Student Workers&#8221; were in that &#8220;reactionary&#8221; hellhole.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

As said on this website McCain would not have been any better than Obama so I dont understand the bitterness towards Obama if the other guy was worst.</p>

			<p>Obama may be fashionable now, but what happens when he becomes unfashionable?  Changing the school&rsquo;s name would be like getting an Obama tattoo.  The naming of places after politicians should be reserved for politicians who are dead, since they can only be counted on to behave themselves post mortem.  It&rsquo;s embarrassing to go to a local stadium that has a big sign naming it after a politician who&rsquo;s just come under federal indictment.  Actually, it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time James Vacca has made the news in Colorado.  His commie club power trip over 16 year olds is well known. Back in 2004 his students were going to perform a song calling for assassination of George Bush and later he instigated a student sit in at Boulder High library after W was re-elected and quote &#8220;expressed pride in the students for staging the protest&#8221;  Gotta love those public tax payer supported schools&hellip;</p>

			<p>I see that deer caught in the headlights look in their eyes in that photo. These kids haven&rsquo;t been out in the real world very long, and they obviously don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like yet. Yet if these students had been black, though, and their school mostly black and hispanic, I&rsquo;ll bet they would have gotten the name change passed with no difficulty.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that some students have common sense.  Not a single high school tried to change its name to George W. Bush High after Shrub was first elected, but it&rsquo;s somehow controversial if we don&rsquo;t want to rush to name a school after Saint Obama.</p>
<p>During his campaign Obama promised that every piece of legislation would be placed on the web for all to see for five days before it would be voted on by Congress.  A good idea, I think.  So what happened?  His first piece of legislation was that monstrous 1000 page &#8220;stimulus bill&#8221;.  Legislators had less than 24 hours to read it, so of course they voted on it without knowing what it said, as they usually do.  The public never got to see it before it was voted on, of course.  So much for &#8220;change&#8221;.  Obama is just another politician.  How long will it take for starry eyed students to recognize that fact?</p>

			<p>After reading two more articles on this story it still wasn&rsquo;t made clear just who it was that contacted the media. Also, isn&rsquo;t it amazing how the media jumped on this story, involving a mere three students. I&rsquo;d bet that if students had wanted to change the name of their school to George Bush Jr. High School, say in 2001, these same liberal newspapers would have told them to &#8220;get lost kid, your&rsquo;e bothering me.&#8221; </p>

			<p>This is the same sort of thinking that got Russia and China into deep deep trouble,throwing the two countries into a very oppressed system of government from which they are still trying to recover.  Not enough research and deep thinking before leaping into nothingness hopefully will not become the major behavior of this country.</p>

<p>What do you mean by &#8220;you people&#8221; Anonymous ? McCain would have been much better, and Sarah Palin is the reason. Your false messiah Barry O. is creating a dangerous situation with the &#8220;stimulus&#8221; pork, pushing for racist PC laws punishing innocent, law-abiding, hard-working White citizens.<br>
He is the beneficiary of privilege, affirmative action, liberalism, $oros and $audi funding.</p>

<p>The big issue here is communist infiltration of our education system.  The public isn&rsquo;t that stupid.  These kids are being driven by their teacher to do this.  It&rsquo;s absolutely heartbreaking to see kids who probably have alot of potential get wrapped up in some loser ideology like communism or socialism for that matter.    </p>

			<p>Memphomaniac, please understand that the military philosophy you quoted was not originally devised by Mao, but by Sun Tsu, who forgot more about military and political strategy than Mao ever knew.  Even if you never read von Clausewitz, read Sun Tsu.</p>
<p>It works pretty well, doesn&rsquo;t it?  If Guderian and Manstein had been given freedom of action in 1942, Russia would never have had a chance.</p>

<p>I hope someone points out to these really dimwitted kids of the Student Workers Club that their name implies Marxist and communist sympathies if not their goals.  Just look at those dumb faces in the photos.  That kid with the dumb Jamaican/African symbols on his Tee-Shirt.  But they are White kids so completely empty of information and brimming with innocence, just trying to be cool.  I think that their parents better begin to inform them better.  </p>
<p>Also, what are they students or workers?  One is usually either one or the other, especially at sixteen.</p>

<p>There are much bigger issues than this that deal with our disposition in America. </p>

<p> You&rsquo;re wrong about that Anonymous. I and many others on this<br>
site would be against a H.S. named for &#8220;McShamnesty&#8221;. Alot<br>
of folks on here are quite aware that McCain, like Obama Is a<br>
joke. May I ask of you what Obama has actually done to deserve<br>
such an honor ? Besides being another idol of the Left.</p>
