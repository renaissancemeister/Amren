<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5754635.ece">Should I Stay or Should I Go: What Every White Zimbabwean Asks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Fletcher, Times of London, February 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At one point or another every white Zimbabwean family has had the same debate: whether to stay in the country they love, as it steadily deteriorates, or whether to cut their losses and move elsewhere.</p>
<p>The young, those concerned about their futures, have mostly chosen to go. One of the many sadnesses of Zimbabwe is that it is a land of broken families, with children and grandchildren scattered across the world, having left to start new lives in South Africa, Britain, North America, Australia or New Zealand.</p>
<p>Some middle-aged white Zimbabweans, including former farmers whose land was seized, have stayed, learnt to play the system and run reasonably successful businesses. A lot of older and retired Zimbabweans, however, chose to stay in the land where they have lived all their lives because they reasoned that genteel poverty would be easier to endure in a warm climate than in the damp, grey cold of England. What they probably underestimated was the extent of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s collapse.</p>
<p>Astronomical inflation has rendered their pensions, lifetime savings and insurance policies utterly worthless. Their last remaining wealth is tied up in their properties, and they now live off remittances from their children or whatever they have managed to stash away in foreign bank accounts.</p>
<p>That was fine until US dollar inflation also began to soar a few years ago. Provided Zimbabweans have foreign currency they can still buy most of the commodities they need, but at silly prices and many now make two- or three-day journeys to Botswana or South Africa to buy pallet-loads of cheaper food. The collapse of the health system means they now have to pay for expensive private health care in foreign currency if they fall ill. The breakdown of water and electrical supplies means they have had to sink boreholes in their gardens and invest in generators. Even The Herald, the miserable, state-controlled newspaper, now costs $1.</p>
<p>Most muddle through, somehow, though they live in constant fear of serious illness or major house repairs. They long ago stopped using their swimming pools. They have turned lawns into vegetable patches. They gave up whisky, then meat, and take their ageing cars out less and less. In extremis there are a couple of charities that offer discreet help to indigent whites.</p>
<p>The Times was told of one elderly man who committed suicide recently so that his wife would have only one mouth to feed. The only problem is that even the most modest funeral costs around $300  &mdash;  which makes the cost of dying almost as prohibitive as the cost of living.<br/>

						<p>
							<i>Peta Thornycroft, Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, February 16, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A SECRET plan has been hatched by President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s most loyal supporters to evict the last of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s white farmers from their land before his 85th birthday.</p>
<p>He is already planning to celebrate the occasion with vast quantities of champagne and caviar, even though half his country faces starvation.</p>
<p>But just in case the Bollinger does not provide enough fizz, his acolytes are preparing an extra surprise: a fresh onslaught against Zimbabwe&rsquo;s last white farmers.</p>
<p>Police, prosecutors and magistrates loyal to Mr Mugabe are understood to be co-ordinating mass summonses against the few hundred remaining white owners in an effort to bring them to court and serve eviction notices.</p>
<p>The deadline for the action is next Saturday, the day before Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s birthday and a week before his planned official birthday bash, which has already provoked criticism for its extravagance. The hospitality will reportedly include 2000 bottles of Moet &amp; Chandon and &#8216;61 Bollinger champagne, 500 bottles of Johnny Walker Blue Label whisky, 400 portions of caviar and 8000 lobsters.</p>
<p>While no official reason has been given for the eviction campaign, insiders say it is timed to hand Mr Mugabe a potent propaganda gift for his birthday celebrations, which normally feature grandstanding anti-colonial speeches.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, in contravention of justice laws, groups of law enforcement officials held a secret eviction strategy meeting in Mutare, 260 kilometres east of the capital, Harare.</p>
<p>The plan is to send out court summons to all local white farmers who have defied eviction orders, aiming for speedy trials and jail for up to two years. Meanwhile, the new occupants, mostly servicemen, will be allowed to move onto the land.</p>
<p>Among the farmers summonsed was Michael Mackersie, who will go to court on Monday for the 63rd time in three years. &#8220;If I lose this one I think that will be it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Law Society of Zimbabwe said it would expel any members involved with the action.</p>
<p>Beyond legal moves, the campaign has also involved violent harassment. Mike Odendaal, a farmer, is surrounded by a pro-Mugabe militia at his home in Chipinge, about 65 kilometres south of Mutare.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have advised him to stay inside,&#8221; said Deon Theron, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union. &#8220;If he moves outside he may be attacked, and they will take his house and then he is gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the biggest push against us in the last few years, worse than the violent weeks after the opposition [Movement for Democratic Change] won last year&rsquo;s election.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November Mr Mackersie was one of 78 farmers who won their case at the Southern African Development Community Tribunal, a court of last resort, which ruled Mr Mugabe had ethnically purged white farmers and failed to pay compensation.</p>
<p>It ordered that those white farmers who had resisted the land grab, in which more than 4000 white farming families were evicted, be left in peace.</p>
<p>Mr Mugabe, who introduced the land grab policy nine years ago as part of a campaign to redress perceived colonial injustices, has said the tribunal has no jurisdiction in Zimbabwe.<br/>

			<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand why there are any white farmers there anyway, do they think they are immune to Mugabe?</p>

			<p>I consider myself a relatively intelligent man, but these articles are a huge contrast to previous reports about this country. </p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read in the past, it&rsquo;s open season on whites in nearly every black-governed country. Therein lays my problem to wit: Why are whites having a problem deciding if they should stay or leave? This should be an easy choice, in my opinion. I&rsquo;d get the hell out, and that, right now. </p>
<p>Were previous articles regarding the wanton murdering of whites false? </p>
<p>Someone help me out, here.</p>

			<p>Do the Law Society of Zimbabwe mean they will expel members if they become become involved in actions against white farmers, or in their favour? This is quite an important point, as it raises the question of how tight Mugabe&rsquo;s hold is over non-government societies and institutions. I imagine they mean the former; I&rsquo;m training as a lawyer, and independent legal assosciations are likely to oppose government coercion which violates their principles.</p>

			<p>Why is this surprising? It was always only a matter of time. I feel no sympathy at all for the white farmers or any whites in Africa for that matter. We don&rsquo;t belong there and Africans have every right to take what is theirs. I imagine that the worst thing that can happen to the natives is that they get exactly what the ask for: a black run and ruled society. Then mother nature will take her course.<br/>

			<p>It;s a d*mn shame that the white Africans (Zimbabweans) would not qualify for landed immigrant status in our country (where they would be outstanding citizens).  Instead, the kennedy immigration act of 1965 gives preference to somalians and others of their ilk (who do not deserve to come here).</p>

			<p>When is NOW, Bill Moyers, or even 60 Minutes (or any other Western documentary show) going to present a story on this subject? Answer; Never!  Question: Why?  Answer: It upsets the impressions of previous White misrule in South Africa and Africa in general and Black hypocrisy everywhere by extension.</p>

			<p>White Africa claims it was forced to give up control, because they were being isolated economically by the West.</p>
<p>Rather than give up either Rhodesia or South Africa they would have been far better off making alliances with Russia, Eastern Europe, Cuba and China.  Better to make an alliance with white communists than give the country to blacks.</p>
<p>And, they were a nuclear power to be reckoned with, which would give any country in the West second thoughts about tryng to push them around.  Admittedly, I don&rsquo;t know the whole story there, but the white power structures seemed to be in excellent positions to carry on without worrying about sanctions from the decadent West.</p>
<p>Anything would have been better than having one&rsquo;s country run by blacks who are barely above an imbecilic level.</p>

			<p>At the rate things are going, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you leave or stay. The whole developed world is being swamped by an influx of black Africans, and they retain the same bad habits they had in Africa. Britain, western and northern Europe, Canada, America, and Australia are all slowly turning black. Detroit is the harbinger of the future of these countries, I fear. Perhaps we will once again have an iron curtain, but this time designed to keep non-whites out of eastern Europe and Russia, which could turn into the last place in the world for whites to live and thrive. Maybe, maybe not, but who would have thought of such a scenario back in the days of the cold war? </p>

			<p>I think a lot of people find it hard to understand why some might want to stay behind. I don&rsquo;t think that necessarily it is because they are stubborn but rather they have known nothing else other than their generational farm that their family has owned, lived and worked on for nearly 130 years.</p>

			<p>Ted, my sentiments exactly. Our home was constantly pillaged. We had a security alarm installed that woke us up at 3:00 AM because of attempted forced entry. The police explained that the perpetrators were testing the response time of the authorities to determine their window of opportunity. Our next defense was a pair of German shepards. The last time we alerted the police, we were told that if someone broke into our home they could sue us if harmed by our dogs. Also they wanted to know just what did we have to entice criminals to invade our home? So this means that the victim is to blame. Laws made by criminals to protect criminals! </p>

			<p>Whether they stay or go, they&rsquo;ll find no welcome from the elites of the Islamic Caliphate of Anglistan, in contrast to the never-ending flow of Somali boy-soldiers, Kosovo-Albanian pimps/drug dealers, Nigerian fraudsters, Pakistani jihadis, etc., etc., who are regularly welcomed to its shores with open arms (and generous welfare benefits, houses, white goods, cars, etc.).</p>

<p>I remember reading at the time of the South African elections when the whites voted to turn the country over to the blacks, that Clinton had put US troops in Africa on alert, presumably to intervene if the whites had voted the wrong way.  </p>

			<p>The runaway inflation reduced their savings to zero. This is why the communist dictator caused it. It is a convenient way to seize the assets of those who worked for them, and make them poor and dependent on the government. The inflation was intentional.</p>

			<p>These whites must leave. Burn their houses and destroy their crops and irrigation systems.</p>
<p>Give the Africans back their land as we whites found it.</p>
<p>Its only fair.</p>

			<p>For an interesting account of the theft of Rhodesia and the removal of President Ian Smith to make room for Mugabe and his communist cronies, which was ordained by Jimmy Carter and his racist U.N. Secretary Andrew Young, read Robin Moore&rsquo;s book &ldquo;The White Tribe&rdquo;. It was shameless then that Carter and Young were more concerned with removing Whites in control and replacing them with blacks despite their inability to govern. Now, the communist thief Mugabe and his thugs have run out or killed most of the remaining Whites, and the blacks have no idea how to feed the population, educate the children, or provide for the public safety and health. The main stream media refuses to see the current situation as a direct result of Carter&rsquo;s incompetence. For a further account of Carter&rsquo;s and Young&rsquo;s theft of Rhodesia, see http://www.africancrisis.co.za/Article.php?ID=40504 ; included is Carter&rsquo;s 2008 request for further American dollars for food, medicine and cash to support Zimbabwe. What a loser this guy is.</p>

<p>  I agree but the problem is so few white countries seem willing to take them. They have no place to go. Most Western countries favor black or brown Third World refugees. </p>

<p>Central and Eastern Europe, The Balkans, Western Turkey, Russia, Southern South America are awaiting you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read that South Africans were denied access to enter the UK. What a shame. I would prefer whites from Zimbabwe over the Kurds by 1000X!</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t leave before destroying everything what they&rsquo;ve built so far as GeoffM mentioned.</p>
<p>I am also sure that if the Whites would leave the states and emigrate to Europe or somewhere else, a civil war would break out between Blacks and Hispanics and the whole country would turn into 3rd world as the Whites had found it in the 16th century.</p>

			<p>I have read, from a few sources, there are black Zimbabweans who long for the days of when this African country was white-ruled Rhodesia.</p>
<p>I have also read that before Mugabe came to power, black Rhodesian soldiers bravely fought against the Marxists, along side of white Rhodesian soldiers.</p>
<p>To everyone reading this post, please correct me as to whether or not I am accurate, or inaccurate, with these two statements concerning Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Folksinger Clem Tholet must have died a very broken-hearted man, when he passed away in 2004, to have seen what became of what used to be his beloved Rhodesia.</p>
<p>I was first able to vote, in a Presidential Election, at the age of 20 in 1976.  Not knowing who Jimmy Carter was, I gladly voted for him back then.</p>
<p>If I was knocked unconscious and woke up back in time at the age of 20 again in 1976, I would have cast my vote for whomever was the Libertarian Presidential candidate.  I still deeply resent it that Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon.  But with the way I now know what an idiot Jimmy Carter is, I could never vote for him again, ever!</p>

Not quite, Matt. It&rsquo;s the developed <b>white nations</b> that are being swamped by an influx of low IQ third worlders, black, Amerindian, Mestizo, SE Asian, and more. This is by design. Whites in Europe, America, Australia etc need to look at the situations in SA, Zimbabwe, the destruction of California in the US and all the other ruination caused by importation or the presence of most types of non-whites. </p>

			<p>A friend of mine recently was in Dallas, Texas, at a diner.</p>
<p>He started talking with a white man next to him.  He remarked that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind emigrating from the States given the election of this new president etc.  The two of them discovered they shared similar views.  It was a brief conversation.  The other man rose and remarked to my friend as he passed him on the way to the cashier that &#8220;The world is getting to be a dangerous place for a white man&#8221;.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard that line before, but it has truth in it.</p>

			<p>Ross - yes, that&rsquo;s my understanding as well. Blacks and Whites served alongside one another. Even the vaunted Selous Scouts had both black and white operators. Rhodesia did a hell of a job feeding many countries on that continent. Carter, Young, and Kissinger all attacked Ian Smith. Of course, England pulled the rug out from under him as well. I admired Ian Smith; sad to see him pass away recently.</p>
