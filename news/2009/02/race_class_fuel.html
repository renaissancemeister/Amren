<h1>Race, Class Fuel Social Conflict on French Caribbean Islands</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, Feb. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A general strike crippling Guadeloupe and Martinique has exposed racial and class divides on the French Caribbean islands where a white elite wields power over a majority descended from African slaves.</p>
<p>Protesters on Monday stepped up their nearly month-long strike action in Guadeloupe by setting up roadblocks across the island. Police moved in to dismantle them and detained dozens of protesters.</p>
<p>The Collective Against Exploitation (LKP), a coalition of unions and leftist groups who launched the strike in January, is demanding that the state and employers to do far more to help islanders cope with the high cost of living.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the strikes on both islands, which between them have about 850,000 residents, have also taken on a racial element.</p>
<p>On both islands the economy is largely in the hands of the &#8220;Bekes,&#8221; the local name for a tiny white minority who are mostly the descendants of colonial landlords and sugar plantation slave owners of the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;A caste holds economic power and abuses it,&#8221; said Christiane Taubira, a French member of parliament for the overseas department of French Guiana on the south American continent.</p>
<p>She warned Sunday that the situation in Guadeloupe was &#8220;not far from social apartheid&#8221; but added that &#8220;the leaders of the LKP are not anti-white racists.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are exposing a reality,&#8221; she told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper.</p>
<p>Rama Yade, the only black minister in President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s right-wing government, said that over and above the problem of the cost of living, there is &#8220;a problem with the distribution of wealth&#8221; on the islands.</p>
<p>The social discord is &#8220;exacerbating&#8221; racial tensions, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guadeloupe, it&rsquo;s ours, Guadeloupe, it doesn&rsquo;t belong to them,&#8221; is the chant heard at recent protests on the island, with a similar refrain heard on Martinique, both referring to the Bekes.</p>
<p>Many people on the islands, which lie about 7,000 kilometres (4,300 miles) from the French mainland, are resentful of the rich minority who over the centuries have mostly married only other whites.</p>
<p>That antipathy was heightened by recent remarks by one of Martinique&rsquo;s richest men, Alain Huygues-Despointes, which scandalised many here.</p>
<p>Huygues-Despointes, a white, said in a documentary screened on French television late last month that one reason for avoiding inter-racial marriage was that he wanted to &#8220;preserve his race.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rich white families largely control imports to the islands, where nearly all manufactured goods come from abroad, and they own most of the supermarkets, which islanders say are charging inflated prices for basic goods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The islands have the same supermarket chains that are found on mainland France, but they charge higher prices for the same goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a monopoly problem, that of an insular economy which is the heir to colonial trading posts,&#8221; said the French minister of overseas affairs, Yves Jego.</p>

								<h2>Blacks Slam White Minority in Martinique Strike</h2>
						<p>
							<i>AP, Feb. 14, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Racial and class tensions gripped the French Caribbean island of Martinique on Friday as 2,000 protesters backing a wage strike chanted slogans against the island&rsquo;s white elite.</p>
<p>Some 2,000 mostly black protesters marched Friday through the capital, chanting slogans against &#8220;bekes&#8221;  &mdash;  the descendants of colonists and slave holders. &#8220;Martinique is ours, not theirs!&#8221; they yelled.</p>
<p>The elite group makes up an estimated 1 percent of Martinique&rsquo;s 401,000 residents, and own the majority of industries. Most of the Martinique&rsquo;s population is descended from African slaves brought to work on its colonial-era sugar plantations.</p>
<p>Many working class families are struggling to make ends meet amid a global economic crisis, exposing racial tensions 160 years after slavery ended in Martinique.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But racial sentiments were inflamed after a one-hour documentary, &#8220;The last owners of Martinique,&#8221; was shown on TV last week. The program focused on how the white minority group has dominated the economy.</p>
<p>One white business owner was quoted as saying historians should look at &#8220;the positive aspects of slavery&#8221; and that a mixed-race family lacks &#8220;harmony.&#8221; Officials in France have opened an investigation against the businessman, Alain Huygues-Despointes.</p>
<p>Martinique&rsquo;s prefect, or political leader, Ange Mancini, had been renting from Huygues-Despointes but announced he has terminated his lease and found somewhere else to live. Mancini is white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Napoleon reinstated slavery here in 1803, mostly to please the beke plantation owners among whom he found his wife, Josephine. After slavery was abolished, the bekes still owned most of the island&rsquo;s land and controlled its workforce.</p>
<p>The nine-day strike in Martinique has shuttered schools, stores and gas stations as residents continue to demand lower prices and higher salaries. Guadeloupe, another French Caribbean island, has been paralyzed by a three-week strike in which negotiations have broken down.</p>
<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Friday asked government ministers to come up with long-term measures for stimulating and modernizing the economy of the islands, including by opening it up to more competition.</p>

From the article: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The islands have the same supermarket chains that are found on mainland France, but they charge higher prices for the same goods.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Think this could have anything to do with the information presented a couple of inches above?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Many people on the islands, which lie about 7,000 kilometres (4,300 miles) from the French mainland&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s the same reason stuff costs more in Alaska and Hawaii than in the Lower 48: the distance the goods must travel to market is MUCH FURTHER. </p>
<p>Anything that has to be imported, that is   &mdash;   which, in the French Caribbean, would mean pretty much EVERYTHING beyond locally grown fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Why is is that such elemental economic reality as transportation costs   &mdash;   so basic that it&rsquo;s understood by white gradeschoolers   &mdash;   flies right over the heads of black adults? </p>

Is it time to turn the key of the island over to blacks as they did in Rhodesia and South Africa? Or will the &#8216;transition&rsquo; be more like that of Haiti? Different paths, same destination.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a city in the US or a nation in Africa, black self-rule is the race to the bottom. It&rsquo;s why I say, the best way to destroy blacks is to give them what they want and then stand back and let nature take its course.<br>

			<p>They should do what they did to other places that had a white elite.  Just take the properties owned by whites and give them to blacks.  Have the government run by blacks.  Then, ten years later watch the residents complain that their government is very very corrupt, there is no food, there is no electricity, there is no clean water, and that crime is rampant.  That is what happened to every African nation once ruled by whites, especially African island nations.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The islands have the same supermarket chains that are found on mainland France, but they charge higher prices for the same goods.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;   Of course, it would never occur to the Guadeloupe/Martinique riff raff that French supermarket chain inventories don&rsquo;t float to &#8220;their&#8221; islands for free from France and other parts of the world for free. The arguments these nimrods are advancing are tantamount to a Frenchman screaming economic injustice because he has to buy fuel for winter home heating and tropical French colonial outposts don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guadeloupe, it&rsquo;s ours, Guadeloupe, it doesn&rsquo;t belong to them,&rdquo; is the chant heard at recent protests on the island, with a similar refrain heard on Martinique, both referring to the Bekes.</p>
<p>The best argument that can be made in that vein is that the islands in question belong to the pre-Colombian indigenous peoples&rsquo; burial grounds on same. </p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not surprising. They&rsquo;re four and half thousand miles away from the mainland. What do they expect?  Prices are high in Hawaii too   &mdash;    for the same reason.<br>
It&rsquo;s a matter of  geography, not discrimination.</p>

That suggestion was addressed here a year or two ago by a former poster, in France, Ethno-Differentialist (who has gone strangely silent).   <br>
As he explained, that is not likely to happen because certain very wealthy individuals use it as a tax haven and a vacation playground, and it serves their purposes very nicely to keep things just as they are. </p>

Ooops, I forgot; the white man can&rsquo;t be an unappreciative parasite like non-Whites and non-Christians. Didn&rsquo;t the White man create these Island  colonies for their European home states and brought the blacks from their African hellhole existance and purchased them from other blacks or later Arabic Muslims ?</p>

<p>I like this guy, not just for what he has said but also for standing up and saying a point that rarely is allowed to get into the mainstream media. One advantage of being independently wealthy is that you can say whatever you like without having to worry if you can feed your family tomorrow.</p>
<p>The reality is that inter-racial marriage would destroy the white minority on those islands, that the slaves were already slaves long before the Europeans arrived in Africa and they had a much higher standard of living in the New World than back in Africa, and lastly how mixed marriages usually fail. Just look at Obama, he said he felt he had no roots and used drugs and alcohol to escape the fact he was (in his eyes) neither White nor Black. Obama&rsquo;s father ran away after being with his mother for less than 3 years.</p>

			<p>Had it not been for the shortsightedness of slavery France would now have two lovely little islands for itself in a scenic and warm part of the world. The best thing now would be to give these islands their independence so that the blacks can&rsquo;t move to mainland France. The blacks will just create another Haiti.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to mention that if the average person is charged less they would be inclined to spend more and this would result in more money going overseas then is coming in which results in a devaluation of the currency on international markets which in turn reduces the economies purchasing power and thus drives up local commodity prices (seen in your supermarket), which in turn would see the minimum wage increased so the people can afford to eat (because starvation is bad) which then increases inflation which then turns your country into the likes of Zimbabwe within a month due to the death spiral your economy has just ended up in.</p>
<p>I am quite happy to bet that the government has artificially created a situation where there are higher prices for imported goods for this very reason, quite possibly through tariffs or taxes.</p>

			<p>Saying you want to &#8216;preserve your race&rsquo;, heightens &#8216;antipathy&rsquo;, creates discord, and is a scandal, not only for the person who spoke the words, but for every other member of the speakers race; at least, if the person who says it is white. Imagine if he said whites had rights beyond just the right to exist? Perhaps it&rsquo;s best that&rsquo;s all he said. </p>

			<p>There are only 5,000 whites on all of Martinique. I thought the idea was, after whites are a smaller minority, or simply one minority among many, racial problem will disappear? It would seem they really want whites to disappear.</p>

I love how this is supposed to be a bad thing.  Shock, horror, they don&rsquo;t want to marry stupid, poor blacks with a chip on their shoulder that harbor immense hatred for them.</p>
<p>Did it every occur to anyone that whites dominate the economy because, much like the chinese in malaysia, they&rsquo;re simply far more intelligent than the other inhabitants?</p>
<p>Of course not, that would be racist!</p>

			<p>Videos (In french) of developments in the French Antilles can be seen here <a href="https://www.fdesouche.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.fdesouche.com/</a> </p>
<p>Most French would happily forego the joys of owning these caribbean islands as they cost a fortune to maintain. However the inhabitants, once they have destroyed their own economies,  will probably come back to France to further &#8216;enhance&rsquo; the diversity over here.</p>
<p>The article is also incorrect in saying that the islands belong to the blacks. They are no more native to the islancs than the whites. </p>
<p>A solution could be to send all the &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; french prisoners to this island. And in a few years time grant the islands  independence. The exprisoners of course will be able to enjoy a new life in their tropical paradise away from the evil white racists  </p>

			<p>Blacks have been in Martinique and Guadeloupe for less time than White Afrikaners have been in Southern Africa. Please, everyone, let&rsquo;s get away from the ridiculous line of argument that mobs of Blacks are some how justified in their envy and hatred of Whites and their actions of threats, murder and mayhem against Whites because they have &#8220;just causes&#8221; trying to take control of &#8220;their land&#8221;, &#8220;their country&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>This line of though has it that if Whites only give in to Blacks in what they want in &#8220;Their countries&#8221; then Whites will somehow be allowed to live in peace in &#8220;our White countries&#8221;, &#8220;White communities&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reality is that Blacks and other NW especially Muslims do not recognize national borders - they want to go and live wherever they like, wherever life is perceived as &#8220;better&#8221; and they will scream bloody murder if any Whites try to prevent them from going and living where  they want.</p>
<p>125 years ago (not a very long time ago in the course of history) there were virtually no Blacks in Detroit MIchigan. Hundreds of thousands of Blacks (mostly from the American South) moved to Detroit for the industrial jobs of World War I, World War II, the auto industry. Now Detroit is overwhelming Black African American, Black African Americans control all local politics. Blacks consider Detroit to be &#8220;Their City&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any remaining &#8220;nice&#8221; white places in the world are in danger of suffering the same fate as Detroit - as millions of Blacks will want to leave their poor, not very nice place and move to where it is better - then these places become &#8220;their place, their hood, their turf&#8221;.</p>
<p>Please everyone, support the Whites in Guadeloupe  &amp; Martinique, work that they don&rsquo;t suffer the same fate as Whites in Haiti, Zimbabwe once suffered. Our cause is international, we have to help our people wherever and whenever they need our help.</p>

			<p>Anonymous query: <i>Why is is that such elemental economic reality as transportation costs  &mdash;  so basic that it&rsquo;s understood by white gradeschoolers  &mdash;  flies right over the heads of black adults?</i></p>
<p>Well, since according to the article intermarriage is rare, that means these blacks&rsquo; median IQ is closer to the African median of 70 than the black American median of 85.</p>
<p>Another example of their low IQ: Tourism is the only real industry on these islands. Continued unrest will cause the (overwhelmingly white) tourists to stay away in droves and the economy will quickly collapse.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the articles make no mention of similar problems on St. Barts or the north side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin" rel="nofollow">St. Martin</a> (the south side is Dutch).</p>

&#8220;An ideal solution would be for whites in Guadeloupe and Martinique to move to France, and for French blacks to be repatriated back to Guadeloupe and Martinique.&#8221; <br>

However, as another poster said above:  &#8220;Blacks have been in Martinique and Guadeloupe for less time than White Afrikaners have been in Southern Africa. &#8220;</p>
<p>This is an important point to be made. Many people have no idea  that blacks are NOT native to these islands.  They were  brought there from Africa, and they are no more native to the Caribbean than Europeans are.  In fact, it was Europeans who  got there first. </p>

			<p>If Blacks do take over the administration of this island, I give it ten years before we will see them floating on makeshift liferafts to Florida and other U.S. destinations.<br>

You won&rsquo;t see them taking rafts to Haiti, that&rsquo;s for sure. You might logically think that they would be most comfortable there   &mdash;   given the linguistic  and cultural similarities. But no thanks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, before any of them get any notions of independence, they should first take a good look at Haiti which has &#8220;enjoyed&#8221; its independence for 2 centuries now. Obviously, those islanders under French rule are vastly better off. Can there be any question?  </p>
<p>Haiti, btw, poor as it is, lives on aid from France. Without that, everything would completely collapse.<br>

			<p>&#8220;Had it not been for the shortsightedness of slavery France would now have two lovely little islands for itself in a scenic and warm part of the world. &#8220;<br>

There actually is such an island in the French Caribbean:  St. Barts.   All white, as I understand. No slaves were brought there. It&rsquo;s the best-kept secret in the Caribbean, quietly  favored by celebrities and the very rich.  VERY expensive too, needless to say.  No cheap tourism there.  Not easy to get to   &mdash;   best to have your own yacht or plane. It&rsquo;s very expensive to be among white other people these days   &mdash;   although that little fact is very discretely never mentioned.  (Naturally, racism doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it! The sun just shines brighter there.)</p>

<p>As said earlier, St. Barts is white. I was in Trinidad a couple of weeks ago and the newspaper there reported on armed gangs committing robberies on St. Martin. It seems to be an on-going problem there. I forget if it was the French or Dutch side.<br>
