<h1>Racial Profiling Alleged in Trial of Staten Island Hit-and-Run Suspect</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Goldsmith and Alison Gendar, New York Daily News, February 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The hit-and-run driver accused of killing a Staten Island couple is not a reckless motorist but rather the victim of racial profiling, his lawyer stunningly claimed Monday.</p>
<p>Theodore Ricks, 24, had no license when cops say he slammed into a livery car early Saturday, killing the driver and his wife before speeding away.</p>
<p>Ricks, who callously told cops the couple should have been wearing their seat belts, was on the road despite his license having been suspended or revoked nearly two dozen times since 2005, records show.</p>
<p>His lawyer Manuel Ortega said Ricks and his passenger were being tailed by cops.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were doing nothing wrong. They were just driving on the road. It raises a serious question why two black men in a Mercedes were stopped,&#8221; he argued.</p>
<p>Police deny any chase and instead say Ricks saw cops along Cebra Ave. and floored his 1993 Mercedes-Benz, possibly because he was driving without a license and his passenger was carrying marijuana.</p>
<p>Ricks ran a red light and plowed into 50-year-old Mohamed Elnahal&rsquo;s cab, killing him and his wife, Mervat Saad Ibrahim, 52, police said. Their twin 13-year-old boys, Kareem and Omar, were left orphans.</p>

			<p>Killed someone with his car, sped away, and had no license.  If that&rsquo;s &#8220;doing nothing wrong,&#8221; I would hate to see what this lawyer considers wrong.</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s assume, for the sake of argument, that the &#8220;two black men in a Mercedes&#8221; were being followed by the police <b> solely <b> because of their race.  How on Earth could this justify them running a red light and then smashing their car into another vehicle, killing two innocent victims?</b></b></p>
<p>Does this mean every time a black man thinks paranoid thoughts about being followed that he can go rob a bank, or burglarize a home, or rape a white woman, because somehow the his being followed by the cops excuses the crime?!?</p>
<p>Only black criminals and an hispanic lawyer in New York City could arrive at such perverse logic. </p>

			<p>Everything in this country will increasingly be about race (for other ethnicities). What will it take for people to see that our future is absolutely miserable. In the future, the US will unify for nothing. Racial spoils will be the order of the day, and &#8216;justice&rsquo; meted out to whites for the audacity of having been a skilled and successful people. Would any people wish that upon their children?</p>

			<p>This might be the dumbest defense I have ever heard.  </p>
<p>The police DIDN&rsquo;T stop them.  There were merely behind them when the suspect panicked, hit the gas, and sped through a red light.  Second, even if the police had stopped them (which they didn&rsquo;t), but even if they had, that doesn&rsquo;t give the defendant the right to flee at high speed and crash through a red light and kill an innocent victim.  </p>
<p>What arrogance they have to show up in court and now act as they are a victim.  What stupidity.  If that is their defense, they are in big trouble.  If they had any sense of decency or remorse they would plead guilty and apologize.</p>

			<p>It is called the Johnnie Cochran defense.  You don&rsquo;t argue reason, facts, logic, or law.  You argue that the man (that&rsquo;s you white people for the unenlightened) was keeping these fine black gentlemen down.  You argue police misconduct caused these law-abiding men to panic.  You aregue to the black jury, the only way to stop police misconduct  in the future is to stop police misconduct now.   Then you throw in a rhyme, if shoe fits you must acquit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that makes no sense, but it isn&rsquo;t about making sense; it&rsquo;s about the man.</p>

			<p>This case falls in to the category of &#8220;Civil Wrongs&#8221; being presented as &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>We need to push the truth that dangerous actions, dangerous illegal actions that have always been considered &#8220;wrong&#8221; by (White) American society are now being excused, defended under bizarre twists that they are &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; - with this modern interpretation meaning that anything a Black African American or other protected, non White person does to get into trouble.</p>
<p>We need to use some humor and strong communication campaigns to present the truth that &#8220;civil wrongs&#8221; (violent criminal activities) are not protected &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Chris Rock video: How not to get your As* beat by the police is a good model for us.</p>

			<p>Besides the question if there was any &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; in this case, there is nothing in the Constitution or its Amendments that would prohibit suspecting a person because of his race.</p>
<p>For instance, if 80% of border violators are Mexican &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; then the only logical conclusion is to be much more suspicious about a &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; traveler in the border area than about a white blonde Swede. And if the majority of &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; in these areas are illegal aliens (which actually is the case) then this fact alone gives an officer a <i>probable cause</i> to stop and question any &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; wandering in the vicinity of the border (and in somne other areas infested by illegals, too).</p>
<p>All calls to end racial profiling are calls for self-inflicted stupidity. They seek to prohibit law enforcement from drawing obvious and statistically valid conclusions.</p>
<p>One more reason to seal the border and deport all deportable aliens. For otherwise they will flock along the ethnic and racial lines and form defense blocs, charging anyone willing to resist their breaking the law with &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;. America is well suited for immigration of whites but is completely not ready to deal with mass non-white immigration.</p>

<p>Two blacks flee police and kill two Muslims leaving two orphans. Don&rsquo;t worry, the whites will clean up the mess and take care of the orphans. This is the multi-cultural hell hole we are falling into. What will it be like in thirty years?</p>

			<p>To William Hendershot: Good heavens, man! Those two kids are left orphans and you dig down that deep to dredge up a remark about us whites being left to clean up the mess? Who&rsquo;d clean it up if they were &#8220;good white Christian&#8221; kids?  Some magic formula applies that would prevent those costs?</p>
<p>While I am certainly no fan of Muslims in general, let me say this: you know nothing about the dead mother or father, and nothing about the kids. Despite their religion or background they might be good, decent, upstanding people. The fact that they were not welfare leeches already brings them up a notch or two.</p>
