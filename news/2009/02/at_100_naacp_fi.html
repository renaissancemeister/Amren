<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29143568/">At 100, NAACP Fights to Keep Struggle Alive</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In between [1908 and 2008], wielding legal arguments and moral suasion in equal measure, the NAACP demanded that America provide liberty and justice not only for blacks, but for all. Now, its very achievements have created a daunting modern challenge as the NAACP turns 100 on Thursday: convincing people that the struggle continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was in college, I could see signs that said &#8216;white&rsquo; and &#8216;colored&rsquo; when I went to the movie theater. That was an easy target for me to aim at,&#8221; says Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP board. &#8220;Today, I don&rsquo;t see those signs, but I know that these divisions still exist .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it&rsquo;s more difficult to convince people that there&rsquo;s a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benjamin Todd Jealous, the new president and CEO of the NAACP, says his greatest obstacle is &#8220;the lack of outrage about the ways that young people and working people are routinely mistreated.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cites figures such as a 70 percent unsolved murder rate in some black communities, blacks graduating from high school at a far lower rate than whites, and studies showing that whites with criminal records get jobs easier than blacks with clean histories.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP reached a low point in the early 1990s, when it faced a $4 million deficit. Myrlie Evers-Williams was asked to run for board chairman. She worked tirelessly to raise funds  &mdash;  while not receiving any salary  &mdash;  and is credited with restoring the NAACP to prominence.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, a civil-rights backlash developed from decades of white guilt and new demands for black accountability.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP now has a $21 million annual budget and 85 full-time employees. There are 525,000 members plus another 225,000 donors; the NAACP&rsquo;s membership peaked at 625,000 paid members in 1964.</p>
<p>NAACP board member Rev. Amos Brown says that Obama&rsquo;s election should not obscure that problems still exist.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we get caught up in the euphoria of this election and fail to deal with reality,&#8221; Brown says, &#8220;it&rsquo;s going to be a short-lived victory.&#8221;<br>

			<p>And to maintain their superfluous organization, there will be more and more pretend &#8220;feuds&#8221; between they and President Obama, with the NAACP taking the leftward position.  There was a story last week about the NAACP wanting to hold BHO &#8220;accountable&#8221; (for what?   &mdash;   ed.).  I think it&rsquo;s all a runup to some show for outward consumption, where Obama pretends to veer slightly rightward on a couple of positions, and the NAACP protests, complains about &#8220;white racists pressuring the President,&#8221; and raise a lot of money   &mdash;   I could imagine Obama playing along, with the promise that the NAACP gives sinecures to his daughters when they are adults.</p>
<p>Also, the NAACP image awards are tonight, and the word is that one Chris Brown, the &#8220;man&#8221; who turned his girlfriend&rsquo;s face into a spitting image of pepperoni pizza, might get an award.  (The girlfriend, she&rsquo;s a singer too, might get one.)  That&rsquo;s so typically NAACP.  I hope Mr. Brown enjoys his award, he&rsquo;ll be so proud of it for the entirety of his prison term.  Except this is Calistupid, nobody will go to prison anymore for anything except murder, homophobia and being white.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Brown, Rihanna up for Image Awards&rsquo;<br>
https://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=751552</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Despite his recently tarnished image, crooner Chris Brown may win an <b>NAACP Image Award&#8221;</b>.</i><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
&#8216;Police: Chris Brown Beat, Choked, Threatened to Kill Rihanna&rsquo;<br>
<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2009/02/chris-brown-beat-up-threatened-to-kill-rihanna/" rel="nofollow">https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2009/02/chris-brown-beat-up-threatened-to-kill-rihanna/</a><br>
<i>Rihanna&rsquo;s right eye was blackened and badly swollen, and she had hand prints on her arms after she regained consciousness. <br>
The responding officers were so concerned about her, they drove Rihanna to the hospital in their squad car instead of waiting for an ambulance.<br>
Officers took two sets of photos of the banged-up star, one at the scene and the second after she was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for treatment.<br>
According to a source cited by TMZ, Brown allegedly hit Rihanna so hard, she could barely open her eyes - they were almost completely swollen shut.<br>
She had a fat lip, her mouth was swollen, her nose was badly bloodied, and she had contusions on her forehead and on both sides of her face.</i><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>If this is the best that they can come up with, the bar must be set pretty low.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Today, I don&rsquo;t see those signs, but I know that <b>these divisions still exist</b> &hellip; and it&rsquo;s more difficult to convince people that there&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Note: These &#8220;divisions&#8221; will <i>always</i> exist until black Americans have been &#8220;Affirmative-Actioned&#8221; into becoming America&rsquo;s new overlords.</p>
<p><i>Benjamin Todd Jealous, the new president and CEO of the NAACP, says his greatest obstacle is &ldquo;the lack of outrage about the ways that <b>young people</b> and <b>working people</b> are routinely mistreated.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Am I missing something, or did the definition of &#8220;problems of young/working-class people&#8221; become &#8220;problems of black people&#8221;?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If we get caught up in the euphoria of this election and fail to deal with reality,&rdquo; Brown says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to be a short-lived victory.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Translation: The &#8220;NAACP&#8221; has been exposed for being little more than yet <i>another</i> self-aggrandising ethnocentric organisation who - like its comrade organisations such as the SPLC - need to find another way to keep the cashflow healthy, despite the fact that what they supposedly &#8220;fought&#8221; has been dead for decades.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, this won&rsquo;t end until either:<br>
1. Black Americans become the new ruling class, or<br>
2. The coming &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; majority seize power and shut them down.</p>

<p>I cannot help it, I did burst into laughter out loud, when I read that glaring written malfeasance in relation to what the NAACP is really about!</p>
<p>What those racial terrorists consider to be &#8220;liberty and justice,&#8221; does not extend to one group of people, and that group of people is and always has been, whites. How else, could they explain their past and current connections to such homicidal groups as the: Black Panthers, Nation of Islam, or La Raza? Their only goals, along with their &#8220;rainbow&#8221; orgy of fellow travelers, is one thing and one thing only: destroying the white race in the USA! Up to that ultimate goal, is soaking that same race for every dime they can get, before we finally do self-inflict that racial apocalypse upon ourselves.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>It could be because those signs don&rsquo;t exist except in his mind.</p>
<p>BTW, when I lived in NYC in the 80&rsquo;s, I passed Mr. Bond on the street one day. He was holding hands with a white woman. Wife, girlfriend, lover? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I did find this:</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find any photos of his first wife, Alice Clapton.<br>

			<p>Justice? Liberty?  Gimme a break.  The black agenda is quotas and handouts and to be able to commit crimes against Whites with impunity.  They&rsquo;ll never have trouble selling that to blacks.  The real questions is how long they&rsquo;ll be able to convince stupid Whites that the ethereal White Privilege is the cause of black squalor.  </p>

			<p>With the election of BHO, the NAAACP has completed its mission. It is no longer needed. It is time to disolve this organization.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re not letting go of the income stream generated by White Guilt. They aren&rsquo;t capable of earning an honest living, and have to keep up the lie to justify their existence.<br>

			<p>NAACP stands for &#8216;National Association for the Advancement of <i>Colored</i> People&rsquo;. <br>
Yet if a white person used the term &#8216;colored&rsquo; to describe Sub- Saharan African DNA descended person publically, I assume that would be politically incorrect?<br>
Pratical excuses for not changing their name aside(same could be said of UNCF and others no doubt), this seems like a good metaphor for the crazy political correctness sickness that has your country by the throat.<br>
Political correctness gives minorities so much power over whites, it&rsquo;s like an invisible cage that only whites are locked in.<br>
Recently here in OZ I was reading through the local Human Rights Commission web site and what was noticeable was their strategy is based heavily on education. And that the key indicator of how bad racism is here, is based on the no. of complaints that they receive from the public. <br>
Which is always getting worst, as the no. of complaints is always rising. Which is no doubt a result of their constant education programs.<br>
Thus their own existence is justified, and more resources commandeered to fight this ever growing problem and educate more.<br>
I&rsquo;m reluctant to use this metaphor as smoke is still over my house right now, and the moon is red with recent ongoing events.<br>
But it&rsquo;s like the fireman who lights his own fires, so he/she can be the hero when fighting it.<br>
I heard, granted via a pro-marijuana documentary that the US&rsquo;s &#8216;war on drugs&rsquo; at the federal level has the same dynamic. That the agencies that fight &#8216;the drug war&rsquo;, in a sense get addicted to the massive amounts of federal funding received annually. Which they can only justify continuing to get by keeping the problem alive, keeping the definition of the problem very broad, ignoring the real growing problems and overstating the declining older problems. <br>
And as time has gone on the amounts of funding have risen dramatically, with recordable success in some areas but with the overall problem getting worst (thus more funding required next year).<br>
A few problem solving people jokingly have said to me that it&rsquo;s their professional goal to make themselves obsolete.<br>
I wonder what these race hustlers would do for a living if they did get their utopian world? as perfection is just an illusion, fleeting at best. Universal equality I do not think is any &#8216;interest groups&rsquo; real goal, it&rsquo;s just a easier ride and a bigger piece of pie for them and their &#8216;hommies&rsquo; that they are after. <br>
It seems the same with stories and comments I read about pushing Black history education on everyone as well.<br>
If Irish descended people reflected and revisted on the potato famine over and over again, there would be more fresh anger and hatred pointed at the English descended peoples too.<br>
In that way Obama being elected has actually helped white nationalists, by taking away groups like the NAACP steam somewhat.<br>
But it also means to survive that they will have to get a lot louder and put more little things under the microscope to complain about.</p>

________________________________________________________</p>
<p>As someone who grew up in a black neighborhood I can tell you the reason for that 70% is because there are usually no witnesses for the murder or by the time they get a lead on the case the suspects turn up dead or missing.</p>
<p>Also, when I was in the tenth grade I saw DEA agents pulling off raids and arrest almost every single week. That was labeled as racist and targeting the wrong group. After a few months of talking and complaining they cut back and eventually stopped. The drugs went up back into the hands of mothers, fathers and children.</p>
<p>blacks graduating from high school at a far lower rate than whites</p>
<p>__________________________________________</p>
<p>I went to a black high school, I saw alot of blacks drop out after not putting in any effort. The only people that stayed were people females and people persuing some careers. If they stopped having babies (out of wedlock) their schools wouldnt be overcrowded and it would be alot easier for them to be educated.</p>

			<p>Maybe, just maybe, the NAACP might be well-advised to stop looking for perceived discrim&rsquo;nashun under every rock and concentrate on instilling some PRACTICAL VALUES into &#8220;colored people.&#8221; Values like not only fathering children, but sticking around to SUPPORT them, and to raise them with decent values!</p>
<p>Advising Blacks to maybe take those silly boom boxes out of their hands and replace them with a real book. Demanding, not asking that their children stop being the class clowns and try to LEARN during school hours. That being a gangsta is not cool, but holding a respectable, paying job is.</p>
<p>Ah, forget it! Blacks, being Blacks, can never bring themselves to admit they&rsquo;re their own cause of poverty and despair. Bill Cosby told them the same thing. We all know how they reacted to that.</p>

<p>Yeah, and I bet they were all murdered by OTHER BLACKS. With their &#8220;don&rsquo;t snitch&#8221; culture and mentality is it any wonder?</p>

			<p>Blacks will agitate until the society in which they live falls into ruin. The Gods have cursed Blacks with the inability to think about the future, and the inability to accept their limitations. They would rather live in dismal circumstances and call it good then to allow Whites, who are far smarter and better at organizing the world to create a secure, prosperous environment for them. Every societal unit in which they predominate is destroyed.</p>
