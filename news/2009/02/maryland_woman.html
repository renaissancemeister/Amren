<h1>Maryland Woman Charged With Smuggling Sensitive Technology</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott McCabe, The Examiner (Washington), February 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Silver Spring woman has been arrested on charges of smuggling the world&rsquo;s smallest unmanned aircraft technology to members of the Chinese government, charging documents said.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said the technology requires an export permit to be sold outside the United States and cannot be shared with China because of national security concerns. The devices can be used to fly miniature military reconnaissance planes.</p>
<p>Yaming Nina Qi Hanson, 51, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. {snip}</p>
<p>Qi Hanson and her husband, Harold Hanson, arranged to buy the tiny technology from a Canadian company, MicroPilot, according to the criminal complaint. Company officials warned the Hansons they could ship autopilot technology to the United States but the couple would have to get an export permit to send the controls out of the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Qi Hanson, who told agents she had relationships with Chinese government and airline industry officials, said she contacted several former classmates in China about buying the technology and eventually collected $75,000 in seed money. Qi Hanson and her friends carried the cash to the United States in amounts less than $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Qi Hanson told federal agents that she transported the technology because she believed it would be used to help the Chinese develop unmanned planes for &#8220;humanitarian reasons&#8221; and for the flight clubs, according to the complaint.</p>

			<p>How much more technology (not to mention security) thefts by China are we going to tolerate? Don&rsquo;t our government officials give a damn about how much trade and technology data and secreats China STEALS from our industries? China even defense technology secrets from defense contractors. . which rest assured, will turn OUR technology against Americans in a possible future war.</p>

			<p>There are only two reasons that China allows its people to come to the U.S., building political influence and spying.  I have to fault the company that sold the technology too.  What did they think the woman was going to do?  <br>
     If we had a real government, spies would just have heart attacks or fall out of windows or something, after fingering all their co-conspirators.  We&rsquo;re sneaking these Arabs off to Guantanamo to put the screws to them, and allowing much more dangerous people a chance to persuade an idiot multi-cultural jury to let them go.  Will they exclude Chinese from the jury pool?  If not, the woman will likely walk.  If you choose to dabble in the black art of betrayal, you oughtn&rsquo;t be expecting Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.  American justice for Americans, Third World justice for the Third World.</p>

			<p>I would have been a much better idea to develope Native Born White American talent in places such as Appalachia for careers in engineering, computer programming and medicine than to important the  chinese fifth column.</p>
<p>I am waiting for the vdare.com collective to adovcate this policy. What do you say Peter Brimelow? Appalacia&rsquo;s youth or the youth of China and lots of chinese spies? </p>

			<p>&#8220;Chinese women says aircraft controls would be used for &#8220;humanitarian reasons&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aha. There is no reason at all to not trust Chinese in sensitive areas of American intelligence and defense, is there? But who am I to argue with the multiculturalists.</p>

			<p>Has anyone seen the number of White men with oriental women these days?  It seems everywhere I look in the big city I see White men with Chinese women.  Now I think I understand part of the reason why.  </p>
<p>The number of Chinese in this country is increasing by leaps and bounds every single day.  The people in the small towns don&rsquo;t notice it, but when you travel to the big city they&rsquo;re everywhere.   <br>
 <br>
I think it was Pat Buchanan that said that in the future there&rsquo;s going to be an Asian professional elite in this country.  I hope White folks start realizing what we&rsquo;re dealing with here in this country, because these changes will be altering our lives forever if something isn&rsquo;t done about this.</p>

			<p>I had the opportunity to work with Chinese migrants, and see how much they retain loyalty to their race. </p>
<p>In the ancient days, a Greek or Roman senator suggested all slaves wear something to identify them from the citizens. His colleague said that would not be advisable, as the slaves could then see their numbers and strength.  </p>
<p>The Chinese know they are gaining in strength and influence in the West when they look around and see growing numbers of people who look like them.  Even the ones who have lived generations in the West are &#8216;rediscovering their culture&rsquo;, now that they are reaching critical mass.   </p>
<p>The Chinese I worked with would do anything to please their homeland masters.  They could not be trusted to be loyal or honest, and had endless justifications for their deceits, involving them being the victims. </p>

			<p>Any white man who is corralled by an Asian female should know that he is the trophy.</p>
<p>White genetics are less than ten percent of the global population, compared to four-fifths being Asiatic. An Asian female is attracted to getting white genetics, so that her genetic descendants will be fairer and stronger and that much more distinct from the brown mass. Having white blood also lays claim to a part of 2000 years of white European civilization, which everyone who is not white has respect for.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why she felt she had to steal it. As soon as Obama comes up with a Sec. of Commerce we can export the technology to China.</p>

<p>Most of the Asian women who &#8220;like&#8221; white men are insecure with their ethnicity, looking for a green card and/or money - NOT because they find white guys more attractive than their own.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Will the &ldquo;Asian are smarter than whites&rdquo; crowd on this site kindly explain why China has to constantly steal Western technology instead of simply using their &ldquo;higher IQs&rdquo; and inventing it themselves?&#8221;<br>

<p><br>
This has come up frequently and here are my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>It has little to do with intelligence. China industrialized late because it only got stability after its Civil War in the 1940s. The following is an example of what they might be thinking.</p>
<p>ChiComs: &#8216;Here we have innovation X (e.g technology, science, weapon, tools etc) from source Y. It took them 6 years to make it. We could probably do it ourselves, in a similar amount of time. But, why spend 6 years when we have a good chance of stealing it in 2 years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this hypothetical example, if China is successful, they will save 4 years of R&D; for the specific item(s). To innovate requires being on the cutting edge. China isn&rsquo;t there yet, but they have found the most effective method for getting to it. What we misinterpret as a lack of creativity on their part (ie. stealing), is in fact the best thing they could be doing for themselves. Note - most Chinese researchers, scientists, companies etc, are legit and NOT engaged in espionage. It is only a minority (the same goes for all world powers who spy).</p>

			<p>When China set out in the early eighties to build its own big three auto makers, they did not reinvent the wheel. They bought modern automobile design and assembly knowledge from General Motors, for a pittance.</p>

<p>Yeah. You used that stupid (most likely fake, as most craigslist personal ads are) before. What does it prove exactly?</p>
<p>Also, the whole &#8220;Most of the Asian women who &ldquo;like&rdquo; white men are insecure with their ethnicity&#8221; argument is hilarious. God forbid they simply find evil whitey physically attractive.</p>
<p>Notice the &#8220;they are insecure with their ethnicity&#8221; argument is never used for white women who misceginate.</p>

			<p>Why should our government care about these sort of thefts?? stupid people in these same offices load up their laptops with this sort of sensitive info and leave said laptop in the front seat of their cars!!! we see these things stolen so often in doesn&rsquo;t even register anymore. The Chinese will be able to use it against the Africans, so good luck to them.</p>

			<p>Nitrana, excellent post.  Other people now:</p>
<p>&#8220;White genetics are less than ten percent of the global population, compared to four-fifths being Asiatic. An Asian female is attracted to getting white genetics, so that her genetic descendants will be fairer and stronger and that much more distinct from the brown mass.

<p>Whichever anon you may be, seems like you are missing a lot of information, history, etc.  Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>White genes as seperating someone from the brown mass?  Hmmm, wrong part of Asia first of all, second of all, the last century of genetics and biology reveal that race is biologically a moot point.  Culturally, still very much a point, but biologically moot.  Remember that.</p>
<p>Second of all, laying claim to 2000 years of European history is nice, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of pride that can be had in laying claim to 5000 years of Chinese history, 4,500 years of Korean history, 4-5,000 years of Japanese history, etc.  Sorry but if you wanna call Europe the cradle of civilization, a lot of people already beat you to the punch.  </p>
<p>Oh, and with respect, believe me, I&rsquo;m Korean, we respect many of the things Western civilization has done, but Asia has own litany of achievements.  We gave you gunpowder, early compasses, the original printing press, metal moveable type, the first ironclad ships, to name a few.  Also, we have the right to look down on some of the things the West has done, much as you can look down on things that have happened in Asia.  America has the legacy of slavery, Germany has the Holocaust, while Japan has the East-Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, Mongols have Genghis Khan&rsquo;s legacy, China&rsquo;s Sinification of the surrounding people, Korea&rsquo;s own Kim-Jong Il, but being Western doesn&rsquo;t make you special, doesn&rsquo;t make you better anymore than being Korean would make me better than you.  Yes, we are different, but you seem to equate your difference as being a better one.  Get it through your head, neither of us can be inherently better than the other anymore than either of us can be inherently inferior to the other.</p>

<p>Slavery existed throughout all of the Oriental countries and the Red Chinese slaughter of their own middle class was an ideological holocaust.</p>
<p>How can anyone compare the accomplishments of America to those of Korea and claim that both nations are equal?  Get real pal&hellip;<br>
