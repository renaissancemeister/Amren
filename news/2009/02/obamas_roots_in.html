<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Roots Inspire Kenyan Dad&rsquo;s Homeland</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Henry, AP, February 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the 17 years since Samuel Nyamwange came to New Jersey from Kenya, he&rsquo;s gotten used to his family calling about once every six weeks to check in.</p>
<p>That changed after Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan, was elected president of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, they&rsquo;re calling almost twice a week: &#8216;Has he (Obama) done anything yet?&rsquo;&#8221; Nyamwange said. &#8220;They think he&rsquo;s going to announce that everybody can come over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nyamwange said he, like many Kenyan immigrants in America, has suddenly gained near rock-star status back home since the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody wants to come over here (to America) now,&#8221; Nyamwange said. &#8220;They want to come here and see things for themselves, and to thank Obama for making Kenya great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilfred Nyakundi, the owner of Mzalendo, a Jersey City convenience store that&rsquo;s a popular gathering place for Kenyan immigrants, hears similar questions when his relatives call.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing they ask you these days is &#8216;How is Obama?&rsquo;  &mdash;  before they ask &#8216;How are you?&rsquo;&#8221; Nyakundi said with a laugh. &#8220;They are excited, and they want to know more from us. They think since we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re experiencing things directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenyans feel a special connection to Obama, and many in Jersey City, home to one of the nation&rsquo;s largest Kenyan immigrant communities, are especially proud of Obama&rsquo;s roots.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter to them that Obama is an American, born in Hawaii to an American mother and Kenyan father, and has only visited the East African nation a handful of times. Kenyans see a source of home pride in every gesture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mogoi [Jaris Mogoi of Jersey City] said while others watched the inauguration to see what Michelle Obama was wearing or which dignitaries were in attendance, he kept his eyes on Obama&rsquo;s Kenyan relatives on the dais. He was hoping to catch a glimpse of them making a dry spitting gesture into his palm  &mdash;  a Kenyan sign of blessing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wrote a book, I would not miss to say that I was a Kenyan in America when the first African-American was elected president, and he is a Kenyan,&#8221; Mogoi said. &#8220;When I saw the Americans shedding tears  &mdash;  and not being born here  &mdash;  to see Americans cry, I felt such joy I cried, too.&#8221;</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;The first thing they ask you these days is &lsquo;How is Obama?&rsquo; &mdash; before they ask &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;&rdquo; Nyakundi said with a laugh. &ldquo;They are excited, and they want to know more from us. They think since we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re experiencing things directly.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This is annoying in I don&rsquo;t know how many ways.</p>
<p>First, their expectation that in a 3.8 million square mile nation with 300 million people that somehow Americans would be experiencing his rule &#8220;firsthand&#8221; reminds me of when I was 4 and thought little men lived inside TV performing for us. The difference is that I was 4, and grew out of it.</p>
<p>Second, the deification of Obama. It&rsquo;s African Big Man syndrome, and it&rsquo;s apparently inscribed in their DNA, on multiple chromosomes, and all the versions are dominant.</p>
<p>Third, the idea that somehow their whole world is going to change because of who got elected, when copious experience shows otherwise.</p>
<p>Fourth, it bothers me because it makes me feel contempt for them, and I really don&rsquo;t want to feel that - but given the constant demands on us to correct their problems I feel I have no choice.<br>

			<p>&#8220;They want to come here and see things for themselves.&#8221; We may have not lost the war completely yet, but we are continuing to do so every day we don`t fight it. Somehow I knew that, from the moment a Jamacian lady  almost fresh off the boat told me she didn`t like the look of my five dollar bill, and that I needed to go back home and get another one before she would sell me a soda and a bag of chips&hellip; And I really, really wanted a soda and a bag of chips. Now I don`t even go to that store, especially to buy a newspaper.</p>

			<p>Obama can&rsquo;t do anything at all in this respect on his own.  Africans all still seem to disunderstand the concept of representational, consensual government, and subscribe to the &#8220;Big Man&#8221; philosophy.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Out of Africa&rsquo; used to mean the need for whites to exit the continent and leave blacks to manage their own affairs by themselves. Since blacks have proven so utterly abysmal at running their own countries, &#8216;Out of Africa&rsquo; now means the entire exodus of Africans out of their continent and into the (for now) developed world.</p>

<i>&ldquo;They think he&rsquo;s going to announce that everybody can come over here.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that ultimately the raison d&rsquo;etre of the black race? Salvation through proximity to whites?</p>
<p>Blacks know their only hope is to be with whites; in schools, in neighborhoods, in jobs etc.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much they talk about white racism, in their heart and soul, blacks know they&rsquo;re better off living with whites than living with their own.</p>

			<p>Oh how wonderful!  It&rsquo;s so multicultural for Kenyans to come to live in the US is it not?!  I just can&rsquo;t wait.  Oh the joy of it all!  The wonder!  Maybe they can bring some of their very advanced culture here so we may partake of their superior customs and traditions.  Oh to be alive in the 21st Century!</p>

			<p>Actually, the Kenyan attitude of pride towards Obama is what we&rsquo;d expect is he were a great conqueror - as in they view the US as a conquered territory, to be properly exploited.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that we&rsquo;re reminded often of what a paradise Africa is without the presence of the evil colonialism of the White Man.  Why would Kenyans want to abandon this paradise for the USA instead of staying there and adding to the already overwhelmingly long list of earth-shattering and useful inventions by Africans?  Indeed, it&rsquo;s quite possible that a cure for cancer will be announced in the very near future by some Kenyan or Zimbabwean scientist.  </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that with so much free advertisement that Kenya is now getting in the news, showing off how wonderful the people are and how beautiful the country is, that more African-Americans aren&rsquo;t inspired to move there in droves?  But that will never happen.  Blacks, regardless of where they are from, would rather live in &#8216;racist&rsquo; America than live free in their own countries.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the &#8216;swimming pool&rsquo; phenomenon here in America.  When you get a new swimming pool, all of a sudden everybody in the neighborhood, even those you&rsquo;ve never met, want to be your friend.  Well, Blacks in America with Obama&rsquo;s election, have just gotten their new swimming pool, and they can expect calls from their long-lost relatives whom they never knew they had for the next four years.</p>

			<p>Why would black people want to move to such a &#8220;racist&#8221; country as the U.S.?</p>
<p>Black people constantly complain about how they are treated here but never want to leave. Ironic when you think about it. </p>

<p>Quite right!  That is why black folks escaping the ghetto is called &#8220;integration&#8221; and why white folks escaping the ghetto is called &#8220;white flight&#8221;.</p>
<p>Black folks abandoning other violent ignorant black people is Good by definition.  White folks fleeing violent ignorant black people is Bad by definition.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering that Asians and Whites were forced out of Kenya after &#8220;independence&#8221;, but Kenyans seem to think it&rsquo;s OK for blacks to live in white countries. How odd&hellip;</p>

			<p>How can these &#8220;poor&#8221; Kenyans afford phone calls?? or find phones that work? How much does a phone call cost to or from there? When WILL they all be allowed to come here? after all the Somalis are here?</p>

			<p>Those Kenyans should know that America is crawling with wicked white racists like us folks here at Amren (the mass media certainly thinks so).  They&rsquo;ll be much better off in Kenya, where they already have the black political leadership they crave.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it probably is true that Obama will invite them all over here.  He certainly won&rsquo;t deport his illegal alien aunt.<br>
