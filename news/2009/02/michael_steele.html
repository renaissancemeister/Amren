<h1>Michael Steele Becomes First Black RNC Chairman</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Sidoti, AP, January 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Republican Party chose the first black national chairman in its history Friday, just shy of three months after the nation elected a Democrat as the first African-American president. The choice marked no less than &#8220;the dawn of a new party,&#8221; declared the new GOP chairman, former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele. Republicans chose Steele over four other candidates, including former President George W. Bush&rsquo;s hand-picked GOP chief, who bowed out declaring, &#8220;Obviously the winds of change are blowing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steele, an attorney, is a conservative, but he was considered the most moderate of the five candidates running.</p>
<p>He was also considered an outsider because he&rsquo;s not a member of the Republican National Committee. But the 168-member RNC clearly signaled it wanted a change after eight years of Bush largely dictating its every move as the party&rsquo;s standard-bearer.</p>
<p>Steele became the first black candidate elected to statewide office in Maryland in 2003, and he made an unsuccessful Senate run in 2006. Currently, he serves as chairman of GOPAC, an organization that recruits and trains Republican political candidates, and in that role he has been a frequent presence on the talk show circuit.</p>
<p>He vowed to expand the reach of the party by competing for every group, everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to say to friend and foe alike: &#8216;We want you to be a part of us, we want you to with be with us.&rsquo; And for those who wish to obstruct, get ready to get knocked over,&#8221; Steele said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not one inch of ground that we&rsquo;re going to cede to anybody,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the dawn of a new party moving in a new direction with strength and conviction.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the sixth and final round of voting, Steele went head-to-head with his only remaining opponent, South Carolina GOP chief Katon Dawson. Steele clinched the election with 91 votes; a majority of 85 committee members was needed.</p>
<p>Just eight years after Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress, the GOP finds itself out of power, without a standard-bearer and trying to figure out how to rebound while its foe seems to grow ever stronger.</p>

			<p>A &#8220;conservative&#8221;?  What&rsquo;s conservative about him?  Isn&rsquo;t he in favor of discrimination against whites?  I fail to see any meaningful difference between Democrats and Republicans so why do people continue to support them with their votes and money?</p>

<p>I can tell you one thing, this is hardly the way to do it with a pro affirmative action neoconservative who believes that more money should be given to black businesses to help them succeed. I don&rsquo;t even believe they voted on this.  Of course the only way to expand the base with nonwhites is to promise more goodies, more big government and more affirmative action.  White America, you&rsquo;ve been left out in the cold.  Do what I did and voice your displeasure by changing your voter registration to Independent and contacting the RNC at chairman@gop.com and give them a piece of your mind.  If we work together on this Steele will resign quicker than Mel Martinez did. </p>

			<p> Wake up call to any White Americans that still do not<br>
see it. Our politicians no longer represent us. If you&rsquo;re<br>
a non-White or not even legal, they&rsquo;ll go out of their<br>
way to address your grievences. The GOP just copies what<br>
the Demorats do now anyway, including sucking up to<br>
minorities while ignoring the White majority. White<br>
America basically receives taxation without representation<br>
now. How long will we allow this to be ? </p>

			<p>Michael Steele has never won a public elected office on his own accord, IIRC.  The Lieutenant Governorship of Maryland is like the Vice-Presidency of the United States, in that the candidate for chief executive (Gov. or Pres.) chooses a running mate.  Bob Ehrlich chose Michael Steele who was then Chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, as a running mate.  Steele tried for U.S. Senate in 2006, but lost to Ben Cardin (white), in a black-heavy state no less.</p>

			<p>The GOP will get no credit for this, just as they received no credit for the first black man and then black woman secretary of state.  To the MSM, it wsa yawn,yawn, yawn.  Until I read it here I was unaware that Michael Steele had been selected.  Seems it only matters if the black is a democrat.  Then they&rsquo;re a REAL black!</p>

			<p>The Republican Party&rsquo;s criminals having been straying increasingly too far to the Left for years, long before this outrage. Steele&rsquo;s selection merely confirms the RNC&rsquo;s intentions to betray America even moreso than they already have.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said many times before, if the RNC wants the Black, Brown, Red, and Yellow votes, they can have them, but they&rsquo;ll never get my White vote again.</p>
<p>Let there be no mistake&hellip; Any White person who votes for a Republican candidate is casting his/her vote against our White race.</p>
<p>Also, please note that Sean Hannity is absolutely in love with Mr. Steele. I do not know where Rush Limbaugh stands on him. I stopped listening to Rush several months ago. He compromises with our enemies too often. Frankly, he has become a liability to Traditional Conservatism.</p>
<p>I voted for Chuck Baldwin in 2008. Who should we support in 2012? Which candidate will stand up and say, &#8220;I represent the interests of Whites and I favor a White America&#8221;?</p>

			<p>They just do not get it.  Whites want lower taxes and less government and no party can keep that platform if there is a majority of non whites.  I wish we had a white party to go to like the British National Party.  Any American third party might be against immigration but they do not have the guts to state anything about racial stuff.</p>

			<p>This is a good thing.  His actions will be no different than his White rivals for power, but people with an ounce of racial awareness will now recognize that the GOP is only the right wing of the ruling anti-White multi-cultural party.  </p>

			<p>The stupid party just got stupider.  I&rsquo;ve now quit the GOP. I held on for a new Reagan, and hoped that Buchanan would take over, but now it&rsquo;s clear the GOP is dead.  It&rsquo;s full of dimwits.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t find a third party that suits my needs, I&rsquo;ll just stay independent until one comes along.</p>

			<p>If you like Republican leaders who carelessly disparage the diverse white American peoples, you&rsquo;ll love it when you learn that &#8220;white bread&#8221; is Michael S. Steele&rsquo;s favorite term to strip Euro-Americans of their diversity (national origins, regional, etc.) as well as their nationality (yes, American).</p>
<p>Check out Politico, page two, paragraph three at:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what he said last December:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Cao represents is a new face, a new opportunity, a 21st-century look for the party,&rdquo; said Steele. &ldquo;The Republican Party&rsquo;s strength comes in many forms and many hues. We have to understand now it&rsquo;s not all white bread.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>From what I have seen of Steele, he is sharp, gracious, has a great attitude, and will be an asset to the party. I read many of the posts on this site and agree with almost all. I think even Jared Taylor would not disapprove of Steele. </p>

			<p>The Republican Party will NEVER get it.  We need to form another party that will without apology represent the interests of the white majority of this country.  Every single time we vote for Republicans/Democrat Lites we are only supporting the same open borders anti-white positions that the Democrats push.  There is no real difference between the two national parties.  Lets follow the lead of the British and form an American National Party.</p>

			<p>Another diversity ploy. One would think that the Republicans would have learned their lesson with the first one- Palin.</p>
<p>Republicans are not conservative. They&rsquo;re big spenders, pro-amnesty, pro-war, corporate shepherds. They spend more time arguing about abortion and gay marriage so as to distract Americans from issues that actually affect us.</p>
<p>The majority of deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are whites. The majority of their big government spending goes to minorities. And they bailout corporations that seek to displace whites by importing cheap labor, as in the recent case of the banking industry, or outsourcing it.</p>
<p>Now I ask all of you, as white, heterosexual males: who does the Republican Party represent?</p>

			<p>It should be apparent to all that right now the &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; believe that they will get the Beast to lay off of them if only they concede a little bit more: this is why Michael Steele is now the leader of the Republican Party, but I ask you - when has concession ever been an effective strategy?</p>
<p>I think the logical implications of this mess was already written and it won&rsquo;t be a pretty story.</p>

			<p>You have to admit that it was only a matter of time before this happened. I recently got on to a website where the Republicans&rsquo; posters were celebrating and talking about the new change for the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Most of these will readily admit that this election was about race, that it was PC and white guilt and black power that put this guy in office.</p>
<p>What do they do? Elect a black to lead their party. If not, they also cheer on the half Pakistani wonder boy Jindhal.</p>
<p>If any Amreners still believe that the Republicans are the only form of resistance to Obama, think again, and know that if these traitors could have run Obama and his platforms on a Republican ticket, they probably would have&hellip; </p>

			<p>This further shows the inadequacy of our presidential system over the parliamentary way where you vote for a principled party instead of personality and get proportional representation. Realistically any third party is a waste of effort in the USA so we are doomed to only have a choice for Republicrats. Like others have said, we have NO one representing us and things look to get worse.</p>
<p>Most white males in the GOP must favor being discriminated against by affirmative racism as shown by their support of Steele who advocates it, but I&rsquo;m leaving today. </p>

			<p>Conservatives in the USA have completely lost direction. They don&rsquo;t conserve, and they&rsquo;re too easily swayed by special interests. They seem to view it as their duty to defend capitalism against socialism, but they&rsquo;re unwilling to stick up for culture.</p>
<p>Picking Steele is, while not the worst choice they could make, a non-sequitur for the Republicans. They&rsquo;re attempting to pander to a new audience but by showing that they&rsquo;re following the Democrats&rsquo; lead, they&rsquo;ve alienated the best possible support base they could have, which is realistic middle class Americans   &mdash;   who seem to generate most of the wealth this country produces, anyway.</p>

			<p>Steele is both a neo-con gun-grabber and an affirmative action Black racist.  I think this is a wonderful selection, because maybe it will get the complacent republicans off their rear ends, quit their party and start a new independent one that actually represents their interests.  </p>
<p>The republican &#8216;neo-cons&rsquo; are neither &#8216;new&rsquo; nor conservative.  They are just old Trotskyites posing as conservatives.  Like most Blacks, Steele naturally gravitates toward any Marxist ideology that will give him a job that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve.</p>

I remember when clinton appointed the cabinet that &#8216;looks like america&rsquo; (i didn;t know america was 40% jewish but that&rsquo;s a side issue)  there was outrage at &#8216;color coding&rsquo; resumes&hellip;now its the norm for BOTH parties. Who has been &#8216;winning&rsquo; since the sixties? Look at the repubilcan platform from 1964 and the dem one. Which one looks more like the other in 2009?</p>

			<p>We need a party just like the BNP in the USA.  Check out their website(http://bnp.org.uk/ for a template on how to start, run and sustain a real alternative political party. What a difference from the third parties that exist or try to exist in the USA and which can&rsquo;t even win dog catcher elections but which come on the scene every so often with a big name who then disappears.  We need to build from the ground up, just as the BNP is doing.</p>
<p>Maybe AMREN should transform itself into a political party? Hmmmm?  It does the same job as the BNP but stops short of organizing as a political party and thus we just see comments on this board, but with no place for the commentators to go to actually do something to change things.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s South Africa, not the US. Different country, different social economical situations. <br>
We had Bush(white man) for 8 years and look what happened. It all came tumbling down too. Similar parallels. <br>
The man should get a chance, if he does good, more power to him, if he doesn&rsquo;t, well you will have something to gossip about.<br>

<p>The color of his skin is a problem. The Republican party picked Steele for symbolic reasons. The message being sent by the Republican party is this:White Males&hellip;..you are history.</p>
<p>It is foolish to go out of ones way to prove that one is not racist-that is to say, that one does not have a racial preference. Democrats,blacks,asians and hispanics are all quite  open about the fact that they would prefer a White minority.</p>
<p>If Native Born White Americans do not openly express a preference against being made a racial minority via post-1965 immigration, they will have allowed blacks,asians,hispanics and muslims to define the terms of the debate.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans better start defining the terms of the debate which are:it is racist to force post-1965 immigration policy upon Native Born White Americans, for over time, post- 1965 Native Born White Americans will be reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority. Nothing else needs to be discussed.</p>

			<p>The truth about Steele is that he was a struggling political consultant when he was tapped by the desperate Maryland Republican Party in the late 1990s to lead it.  Steele was an articulate gimic a decade ago and he&rsquo;s one now.  Except as a networker and a public speaker, Steele accomplishments are few.  Of course, most politicians are no better than Steele.  </p>

			<p>The GOP remind me of a girl I once taught, &#8220;Stephanie&#8221;.  She didn&rsquo;t like &#8220;Natalie&#8221;, and was quick to criticize anything the other girl did, sometimes getting right in her face about it.  But, despite her contempt, Stephanie regularly followed Natalie&rsquo;s lead in fashion.  Natalie got a certain haircut, and three months later Stephanie got a similar cut.  Natalie dyed her bangs, and, after a grace period, Stephanie did the same.  In hair, clothes, jewelry, or make-up, Stephanie followed her enemy.  <br>
     Like Stephanie, the GOP envies its rival, and would trade places if they could.  Republicans are just politicians who are stuck living amongst conservative Whites.  They have to win the votes of their constituencies, but their hearts are with the Reds.</p>

			<p>A view from the British National Party;  As previous posters have said, European Americans are desperately in need of your own BNP, and you have an outstanding leader-in-waiting, in the form of the quite brilliant Mr Jared Taylor.  My understanding of American `democracy` is that the barriers imposed upon the formation of a third party are huge, but for ALL our sakes you really do have to try.  The utterly useless and hopeless Republican Party, like the ironically-named `Conservative` Party here in the UK, is now long past the point where it can be saved.<br>
The other thing you must do is look smart, be smart, work hard, and get rid of hate-mongering neo-nazi cranks who do the cause of saving western civilisation more harm than good.  We absolutely DO NOT tolerate people like that in the BNP, and 2 years ago I was elected for our party (in first place) onto Redbridge Council in London.<br>
We regulary win elections against the 3 `mainstream` parties here, and we are serious contenders for seats in the European Parliament this June.  Please dont give up hope America.  You guys are `can do` kind of people, and the final victory will be ours.<br>

<p>The way I see it, latte sipping liberals who force-feed the multi-cultural line are no more our friend than an MS-13 gang-banger is. </p>
<p>On the flip-side, I have more in common with a latino family man who works hard, hates big government, wants a safe, moral society, low taxes and all the other things I want &hellip; than Tom Dashel or Nacy Pelosi.</p>

You brought in Mr. Steele, a so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; that supports abortion, race based politics, and gun control. I wonder if you&rsquo;ll notice that I just slipped out of the &#8220;big tent&#8221;? How long do you think it will take the committee to realize that their token black will not bring in many third world voters, but will lose them many votes, like mine? </p>

<p>The BNP is a party for the indigenous people of England (read, white people).  We need a party in the US for the indigenous people of Europe in the European diaspora.</p>
<p>Forget about trying to start a diverse party or one that is too stridently white.  Again, just look at how the BNP is doing it, and follow suit.</p>

			<p>Who cares?  The REpublicans hate us because it was white men who invented labor unions, workplace regulations and the concept of a living wage.  They want to exterminate us as much as do the Democrats.</p>
<p>I have done a lot of research on affirmative action.  It was not Johnson but Nixon the REpublican who developed the no whites need apply policy and Reagan who outlawed most of the federal civil service exams. Nixon also created section 8 housing which has been far worse for white neighborhoods than the huge housing projects.</p>
<p>The Republicans will soon disappear as did all political parties but the Democrats during the 19th century.</p>

			<p>The main job of the RNC chairman is to raise money for the party; perhaps he will be an effective moocher (the mooch gene, 45BO469, is found in 86% of all Africans). Seriously, with the Republican Party in the pathetic state it is in, does it matter much whether Michael Steele or Michael Phelps is the RNC chairman? </p>
<p>The Dems have a solid ideological base, Liberalism. Love them or hate them, they have been consistently Liberal since the 1950&rsquo;s, when they purged the Dixiecrats. The Republicans, abandoning their &#8220;core values&#8221; of Federalism and opposing racial discrimination, anxiously took the Dixiecrats in. Since then, the Republicans have become an anti-Democratic Party coalition. A disparate coalition of groups that are often antagonistic: Neocons, Paleocons, Christocons, Libertarians, disgruntled Democrats, pragmatic Centrists (Perotists), mainstreet moderates, etc.</p>
<p>Their strategy is to wait until the swing voters become disgusted with the Dems, and then slipping back into power. It worked on a national level in 1968, 1980, 1994, and 2000. Will this strategy be effective in the future? With the Republican core vote shrinking, it will take a lot of bad news for enough voters to turn to the Republican Party.<br>

			<p>In an act of shameless pandering to blacks, the Republicans chose a liberal black to head their party. This just goes to show how worthless the GOP is. </p>
<p>At least the Democrats who know their base is, Republcians want everyone to love them. In order to make the GOP into a lovable party for minorities they have to abandon all the positions that real right wingers care about. They truly are the &#8220;stupid party&#8221; as the late Sam Francis observed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I switched to independent before this happened. To my fellow whites I ask this, please stop wasting your time on party politics. There is no major difference between the two parties. Bush supported amnesty for illegals, McCain supported amnesty for illegals, and Barack Hussein Obama supports amnesty for illegals. The differences are only superficial on the substantive issues they are all in agreement.</p>
<p>Party politics are a huge distraction and a diversion of valuable time, money and talent, into an area where we will never make any progress (at least not until a significant number of white Americans feel the way we do on the issues.) </p>
<p>To those of you who still think most whites feel the way we do about race or traditional values&hellip; Whats it going to take to convince you they dont? Barack Obama has been elected, and the Republican party just chose a black leader&hellip; Most Americans dont&rsquo; like our views. </p>
<p>If you want to make a difference, try to educate White American&rsquo;s about race, don&rsquo;t waste your time on a party that sold us out long ago. Mr. Steele even supports affirmative action, whats next? </p>

<p>We have a liberal (democratic), conservative (republican), and NDP (socialist) plus the Bloc Quebec that has only the interest of Quebec as a priority.</p>
<p>The liberal and conservative have become very similar like your democrat and republican.  They both pander to the minorities.  Just now the new federal budget is forecast for 85 billion deficit over the next four years.  What a fiasco.</p>
<p>They blabber about global warming and green house gas.  Well stop importing 250,000 minorities and all of a sudden there will be that much less green house gas emissions.</p>
<p>My point is that we have nothing to vote for, just like now there is nothing to vote for in the USA.</p>
<p>Time for revolution.</p>
<p>Time for a new party that is grass roots driven.</p>
<p>Actually we had a reform party but it was taken over by the conservatives after they were decimated in a previous election and have now come back to life to lead a minority government.</p>
<p>So you see, even setting up a new party is not without risks.</p>

			<p>I ran across this site and the words on here are quite disgusting. I am a black conservative from the North who believes in free trade, limited government, and limited social entitlement spending. My two heroes are Margaret Thatcher and Barry Goldwater. Also, you might be shocked that as a black person, I find welfare and affirmative action to be more harmful to blacks then anything else. Saying that, you guys do not represent the Republican Conservative Movement at all and am rather happy that you are exiting MY party.  I joined the Republican Party because it is a party that believes that everybody that was born here in the United States can achieve the American dream if they work hard enough, use financial prudence, and love your country.  Just because I am black doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t right to be the President of the United States?  That is flawed and dangerous thinking. I have just as much as a right to be a leader in this country just as much as you guys whom so happen to be white have.  It would be one thing if you didn&rsquo;t Michael Steele because he wasn&rsquo;t on point with your views, but it is another thing to be lamentating the fact that a black man can head the Republican Party.  I mean you guys are the reason why people aren&rsquo;t voting for the Republican Party anymore.  Your racist attitudes towards people who aren&rsquo;t of European descent is quite mind boggling.  I have a college degree, never taken one dime from the government I didn&rsquo;t earned, and I try to bring the gospel of Conservatism (in a Northern state) but yet you guys would&rsquo;nt even deal with me because if I ran for public office because I am black.  Trust me, whites will always be here in American and we as blacks are not in our trees plotting a way to destroy the white race.  America is a changed place where if you work hard, follow the law, and respect others, no matter what race you are, you are excepted and welcomed.  You guys will never win because with the destruction of Jim Crow, was the end of racial discrimination against others.  We are all God&rsquo;s children and he made us equal. When Christ died, he didn&rsquo;t just die for the white man, he died for us all.  When the Lord judges us, he is not going to go by the color of our skin but he will go by our actions.  Think about that for a second.</p>

I expected to hear alot of excitement and gushing over Michael Steele as he tries to convince his listeners that this guy is right for the Republican Party.  The timing of his absence is a little odd in that maybe he wants to avoid the discussion altogether when he comes back Monday because it might hurt his credibility. </p>

<p>The whole idea that the only good White is a craven, guilt-ridden White who agrees with everything a non-white says and loves them unconditionally, is so absurd that the fact that the promotion of this idea has been so successful does not in any way make it true.  On the contrary, what it does make clear is that - we live in ABSURD TIMES!</p>

I don&rsquo;t want to speak for the readers here, nor have they asked me to, but, I will say as someone who has visited this site off and on for a couple of years now, many of us came here from formerly liberal, even left backgrounds, and not just Conservative or Republican (there&rsquo;s a difference as I am sure you know).</p>
<p>Since the moderators here do a pretty good job of weeding out obscenities or insults I think you will a fair share of the comments to be fairly on target and loaded with lots of personal experience.  In fact, a number of us have complained that even AR is too, well, kind, and not as candid as it should be, given the extent of the mounting opposition.</p>
<p>Never the less, I am glad you posted, and I mean it.  Keep coming back. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find that your remarks will be given fair consideration, though we may not agree.  And isn&rsquo;t THAT what a democratic society is supposed to be about? </p>

			<p>One poster on here, who identifies himself as black, argues that what is important is conservative views.  Some of us, by contrast, argue that it is not our views that are subject to extinction, but our people.  Our people are white before anything else.  It is essential to our nature.  If we become black but still have conservative values, we have won nothing.  If we stay white but lose our conservative values, we will still exist and we will have won. Yes, genes are important.  In fact, they are essential to who and what we are. Political views are not essential to who and what we are.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bother with AmRen, promote your views among your own race. If enough of them change their attitudes, White men will change theirs. There is no need to tell them not to hate White men; just tell them to do what is in the longer term interest of Blacks: When White men have been destroyed, America will be a very unpleasant place for the &#8220;buthas&#8221; and &#8220;sistas&#8221; to live in.</p>

<p>With all due respect, you have no idea that you, and your race as a whole, are merely expendable pawns on the chessboard of the global elite. Blacks are pawns utilized to destroy the poor and middle class Whites, by forcing them into our schools and neighborhoods, which destroys our quality of life. Mass third world invasion serves the same purpose. </p>
<p>In time, only the elites will have a decent place to live, high quality schools to send their kids to, or have any quality of life. The rest of society will be reduced to a pitiful conglomeration of welfare dependents and wage slavers. Whites will be sorrounded by a sea of non-Whites, and our elites will look on in approval as the non-Whites rob, rape, dispossess, miscegenate, and murder us out of existence.  </p>

<p><i>Also, you might be shocked that as a black person, I find welfare and affirmative action to be more harmful to blacks then anything else.</i></p>
<p>Not really.. most posters on Amren are familiar with Larry Elders, Thomas Sowell, and Ward Connerly among other Black conservatives/libertarians who hold the same views as you about affirmative action and welfare. FWIW Mr. Steele is in favor of affirmative action:<br>

<p><i>I mean you guys are the reason why people aren&rsquo;t voting for the Republican Party anymore.</i></p>
<p>Well actually I think it was the ineptitude of George Bush that reduced the GOPs influence. The Democrats have accused the Republicans of being racists for decades..they just recently stepped up the volume. </p>
<p><i>I try to bring the gospel of Conservatism (in a Northern state)</i><br>
Good and good luck. </p>
<p><i>but yet you guys would&rsquo;nt even deal with me because if I ran for public office because I am black.</i></p>
<p>Not necessarily.. I would vote for someone like Thomas Sowell over almost White Democrat (and a number of Republicans), especially one as disgusting as Ted Kennedy. </p>
<p><i>You guys will never win because with the destruction of Jim Crow, was the end of racial discrimination against others.</i></p>
<p>I think you meant to say the end of racial discrimination enforced by law not the end of racial discrimination. But as long as affirmative action or more fashionable phrase &#8220;diversity goals&#8221; exist there is legal racial discrimination.. in this case generally against Whites. (Although Asian have lost seats in University admissions to so called under represented minorities..) </p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been involved with in-group political groups in the GOP (I have now quit the GOP) you will find the room full of lifeless nerds who are afraid of their own shadows. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly a pitiful group of testosterone challenged creeps who can&rsquo;t get dates so they turn to politics. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re forever looking for good Mr. Black or good Mr. Latino to give themselves cover.  Look at the likes of Rush Limbaugh for a well known clue as to how they operate.  </p>
<p>If they can find a black or Latino who sounds &#8220;conservative&#8221; they praise them to high heaven, only to finally be dumped on by the blacks or Latinos who understand that their real identities come from their genes, not from transient political theories and who dislike these lifeless nerds as much as I do. After you talk to some of these nerds, you want to take a shower.</p>
<p>Remember Colin Powell, &#8220;the greatest general who ever lived (LOL),&#8221; who gave the bird to Limbaugh and others and voted black instead of conservative and who thus fell from grace with the nerds and suddenly wasn&rsquo;t such a great general after all?</p>

The very next morning the posts have been removed and I can no longer login to their website. I guess, the truth in this case has been so heavy for GOPUSA that they cannot bear it. Tell me more about <b>censorship and arrogance</b>. I would hypothesize that neocons and former Democrats have already rooted themselves there - not a good prognosis for the vast majority of GOP members.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m hard right and white.</p>
<p>But I say give Michael Steele a chance. As Gov of a very liberal state, he has to water down his views when he speaks them. I&rsquo;m not sold entirely on him being anti 2nd Amendment, or squishy on Pro-life or pro-affirmative action. Give the guy a chance. Actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>People like Black conservative share our core values of living in a healthy, pro-American civilization where big government stays out and we all have a chance to live a happy prosperous life. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very amiable of non-whites who hold similar views as I do.</p>
<p>To me, latte sipping white college professors that preach nonsense are just as alien as the MS13 gang-banger.</p>

			<p>Whites are like the proverbial married couple supporting opposite parties that drive to the polls in order to nullify each other&rsquo;s vote.  Look at California, which only became a blue state after Hispanics stopped splitting their votes and started voting like blacks.  Voting as a bloc was KEY to maximizing their political power.    </p>
<p>The fact is that until whites start to vote as a bloc as well, we will become more and more marginalized politically.  I don&rsquo;t think any of us know how to make this happen.  </p>

			<p>What a wonderful way to reward all those traitorous black &#8220;Republicans&#8221; for deserting them and voting for Obama.  Steele already admitted in an interview that he didn&rsquo;t think he could get more blacks to join the party so why pick him?  Wake up America, the same people who run the Democrat Party have infiltrated the RNC.  For a party that says race doesn&rsquo;t matter, it seems to be the only determining factor here.  It sure wasn&rsquo;t based on qualifications because like Obama, this guy has never done anything and even worse, he&rsquo;s never been elected to an office.  Do what I did and protest by changing your party affiliation to Independent at the voter registration office.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;I ran across this site and the words on here are quite disgusting. I am a black conservative from the North who believes in free trade, limited government, and limited social entitlement spending. My two heroes are Margaret Thatcher and Barry Goldwater. Also, you might be shocked that as a black person, I find welfare and affirmative action to be more harmful to blacks then anything else. Saying that, you guys do not represent the Republican Conservative Movement at all and am rather happy that you are exiting MY party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Conservative Economist.</p>
<p>I agree with you completely.  Welfare, abortion, gay issues, economics, those issues have nothing to do with us.  This is a white nationalist site.  White nationalists who are interested in abortion, gay issues, labor issues and economic and foreign policy need to</p>
<p>LEARN TO SEPERATE!!!!  those issues  from the important issue of the survival of whites in the face of government enforced vicious discrimination against us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only issue.  Any white person who involves him or herself in any other issue than affirmative action discrimination is a fool and an idiot.  Do my fellow amreners think that any of the anti abortion or anti gay marriage whites are going to help us against affirmative action discrimination and black on white homicide?</p>
<p>He&& no!!!!</p>
<p>Repeat, repeat, repeat  Our only issue is white survival in the face of government sponsored slow genocide.</p>
<p>Be active in 2 amendment, anti abortion, anti tax, anti gay marriage groups if you want.  But don&rsquo;t think those so called conservatives will help us in return for our help.  They won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Always remember that the worst affirmative action Presidents were Nixon and Reagan, Nixon more than Reagan.</p>

<p>Black conservative, free trade, limited government and limited social entitlement have nothing to do with white nationalism.  Nor do abortion or any other so called conservative issues.</p>
<p>We are not a conservative website.  We are not a liberal website.<br>
We are a white nationalist website concerned only with the anti white discrimination practiced by our government for the last 70 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;free trade, limited government, and limited social entitlement spending. &#8221;  What do these issues have to do with the government enabled and encouraged out of control rates of black on white homicide and rape?  Absolutely nothing. What do these issues have to do with the fact that it is practically illegal to hire a white for any job unless she is a handicapped communist lesbian?</p>
<p>I voted for Reagan because I hoped he might reward the working class whites who put him into office by moderating affirmative action.  Instead what did he do? He eliminated most of the federal civil service exams because black college graduates, even those with master&rsquo;s and doctoral degrees could not read at the 12 grade and do basic math at the 10th grade level to pass federal civil service exams.  I haven&rsquo;t voted since.</p>
<p>Republicans are as much the enemy of whites, especially the majority of us who are lower middle class as the Democrats are.<br>
The Republicans hate whites because we invented labor unions, the concept of a living wage, safe working conditions and a social safety net.</p>
<p>Republicans are not all that much different from the 1600&rsquo;s wealthy colonial land owners who imported Africans and legalized slavery because the white indentured servants insisted on enforcing the indenture contract that stated they were to be freed after 7 years.</p>
<p>The Democrats hate us because we are White.</p>
<p>I really wish that Jared or someone would state on the home page that we are a white nationalist site and have nothing to do with other so called conservative issues such as abortion, free trade, taxes, gay issues blah blah.<br>

			<p>This is really sad.  I got an email from that Rebuildtheparty.com website I registered with.  Their goal is to remake the party with it&rsquo;s original conservative roots.  Read what it says:</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, last week Michael Steele became our new Chairman of the Republican National Committee.  It was an exciting moment for our party as this competitive race drew international attention and Republicans everywhere are energized for what is to come.  Not only did Michael Steele endorse our 10 point plan but so did the other newly elected members of the RNC.  Jan Larimer was elected Co-Chair, Sharon Day was elected Secretary, and Randy Pullen was elected Treasurer of the RNC; congratulations to all of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Either they&rsquo;re trying to put a happy face on a disastrous event or this is just a facade for raising money for neoconservative elites.  What&rsquo;s there to rebuild?  The same edifice is still standing only it&rsquo;s been given a coat of black paint. </p>

			<p>&#8220;To Black Conservative Economist: Please do stay in the Republican Party. You deserve each other. What you believe or don&rsquo;t believe is of no concern to many of us. You are not part of our people, because a people is not determined by beliefs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Race is not the overriding factor when judging one&rsquo;s character and overall goodness. There are people of your race who will rip you into a million pieces if they could. I know that because of my experiences with my own people. If you believe that race is the only factor in your survival, you are wrong. White nationalists like yourself ho believe in self determination and so forth should live together. But if you think the White Globalist Elite would extend an olive brach to you because you are White, then you are a fool. Communists, Collectivists, Socialists, and Fascists of any race couldn&rsquo;t care less if you lived or died. Quite frankly, they&rsquo;d rather you&hellip;and me, died. Stay among people of your race but more importantly, make sure they have the same BELIEFS, and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

			<p>About 8 or 10 years ago, I was cleaning out my office.  I had maybe 12 years of back issues of The American Spectator, neatly arranged in chronological order.  I took them down to the local GOP headquarters, and none of the half dozen people there had even HEARD of the magazine.  This was when the Spectator was on a jihad against Bill Clinton and his bride, and getting harassed by the IRS in return.  All the conservative writers were published in TAS.  My God, I thought, these are supposed to be politically aware people and they&rsquo;d never heard of TAS?  Just what DID they read?  The Republican Party is full of beardless, chinless, unweaned, flaccid minded, invertebrates.  The women in the party are the only ones with any guts.  </p>
