<h1>California School Spends $10G a Year to Teach AP Spanish to Kids Who Speak Spanish</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nora Zimmett, FOX News, February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A middle school in Southern California is spending $10,000 a year to teach Advanced Placement Spanish to 35 of its 650 students  &mdash;  and all but one of them are already fluent in Spanish.</p>
<p>Thirty-four of the kids in the AP class are from Mexico or are the children of Mexican immigrants. They all grew up speaking Spanish at home.</p>
<p>The program  &mdash;  the only one of its kind in California  &mdash;  has outraged some critics who say they are concerned that the AP course wastes public resources  &mdash;  including taxpayer dollars  &mdash;  to teach native Spanish speakers how to speak their native language in an American public school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But administrators at Lemon Grove Middle School, located eight miles outside San Diego, are enthusiastic about the program, which they say will help prepare the 6th- through 8th-graders for college.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is basically to provide kids with an opportunity to excel and to feel really satisfied about doing the higher level work,&#8221; Lemon Grove School District Superintendent Ernie Anastos told FOXNews.com.</p>
<p>He said the AP course goes well beyond the students&rsquo; everyday conversational skills. &#8220;This is not ordering-at-a-restaurant language. This is taking a graduate course language.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics also say Lemon Grove&rsquo;s AP class is wasting California&rsquo;s tax dollars during the severe national recession. The state&rsquo;s budget, signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last week, cut over $8 billion in educational spending. The federal stimulus package may soften the blow of the cutbacks  &mdash;  preliminary estimates show the state will receive over $8.5 billion for education  &mdash;  but that is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Advanced Placement course curriculums are provided by the College Board, a non-profit association that offers standardized testing for college-bound students, including the SAT. In most cases, AP classes are offered only in high school for high-level students who qualify based on their grades.</p>
<p>A high score on an Advanced Placement exam often allows students to be exempt from taking introductory college courses in the subject. In some cases, a good AP score in high school will fulfill a college&rsquo;s proficiency requirement in the subject.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured I&rsquo;ve got a natural asset  &mdash;  and that is, kids who are Spanish speakers  &mdash;  and this would be an opportunity for them to get a head start,&#8221; Moss [Ambler Moss, Lemon Grove principal] said.</p>
<p>But teachers in other school districts question Lemon Grove&rsquo;s motives for offering the course to middle schoolers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s behind that, but I have suspected and continue to be wary of programs in my district that are making it easy for kids to graduate from high school, and also helping to pad their GPAs (grade point averages) and their chances of getting into universities,&#8221; says Dan Kimber, a teacher in the Glendale Unified School District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another concern is that Advanced Placement classes are weighted  &mdash;  a student&rsquo;s grade in an AP class is equal to a higher grade in a non-AP class  &mdash;  and a good grade in an AP class impresses college admissions offices.</p>

		<p>You would think they would all get As in this course.  Somehow, I get the feeling that they aren&rsquo;t, as some native Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrants are illiterate in Spanish.</p>

		<p>I think anyone who speaks any language could use a refresher course every so often. I&rsquo;m taking a Business English class this semester, and it&rsquo;s the hardest class I&rsquo;ve taken since math (and at least math has rules to follow!) English grammar is ridiculously difficult and I realize that I&rsquo;m terrible at it, but I can&rsquo;t afford to be perceived as uneducated.</p>
<p>If this class is indeed &#8220;graduate level&#8221; language, then let&rsquo;s see the syllabus. Do the students have to write and produce an original play in Spanish? Is there a ten-page paper on El Cid and the Spanish Moors? Spain&rsquo;s role in the formation of the Holy Roman Empire? The Influence of the Spanish Civil War on Latin America?</p>
<p>If the students are so advanced, let them show it with their work. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got no problem with this. If you&rsquo;re going to speak Spanish, you might as well learn to speak it well. </p>

		<p><i>Do the students have to write and produce an original play in Spanish? Is there a ten-page paper on El Cid and the Spanish Moors? Spain&rsquo;s role in the formation of the Holy Roman Empire?</i></p>
<p>The answer is no, no and no.  The AP Spanish website says the goal of an AP Spanish course is to <i>&#8220;understand Spanish spoken by native speakers at a natural pace&#8221;</i> and to <i>&#8220;develop an active vocabulary sufficient for reading newspaper and magazine articles&hellip;in Spanish without dependence on a dictionary.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely not a Spanish lit class. It&rsquo;s DESIGNED for non-native speakers   &mdash;   to get them to think like a native speaker.  It would be like me moving to Mexico City and enrolling in &#8220;Advanced Ingles.&#8221;  I&rsquo;d probably get an A, but so what?</p>
<p>The teacher quoted senses what&rsquo;s going on: it&rsquo;s a way to get Mexican children an easy mark on an AP exam, even if they don&rsquo;t speak English well, by exploiting a system designed for American children learning Spanish. Native English speakers can&rsquo;t do the same thing, since AP English is designed to challenge them.</p>

		<p>This amony hundreds of other examples, proves that California is lost beyond redemption and will continue to its final collapse. It is so utterly obvious to anyone who has a history in California for a good length of time, and it is becoming obvious to those who have been here for just a short time as well. Californias politicians are a class-A example of what democracy can degenerate into. Plat put democracy low on the list of candidates for governmental systems, because he said the unwashed masses would continue to be catered to by those corrupt politicians who expected to be re-elected by those masses  &mdash;  until the system degenerates into a dictatorship. California is a dictatorship, a dictatorship of the Democratic Party.</p>

		<p>Mexicans in Mexico and Mexicans in the US are among the least educated Spanish speakers in the world.  Most Spaniards, Colombians, Argentines, and Cubans find Mexican Spanish to be extremely light on vocabulary and heavy on vulgarity.  If these kids actually learn something other than gang slang, I&rsquo;m all for it.  The Spanish language has rich literature and innovative authors.  I just hope it&rsquo;s not a Mexican or (yikes) a Mexican-American/Chicano teaching the course, for the kids&rsquo; sake.</p>

		<p>David is wrong about one major point that makes the rest of his post meaningless: in HS, any student can take AP in many languages, and many do take it in native languages other than Spanish. WHat is newsworthy about this article, is that 12 and 13 years olds are doing work that is meant to be done at 16 or 17. So, yes, the school is training its students to a higher level.</p>
<p>If 10K is problematic, do we also think that the tens of thousands is irresponsible for athletics,band, drama etc..?</p>
<p>The hispanic population has the highest drop out rate in the nation, according to some reports. AP classes are one of the best dropout prevention strategies that there is, as students who enroll in such classes almost always finish high school.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that a better question is why aren&rsquo;t we doing this more for that population group? Why not capitalize on their native fluency and turn a disadvantage into a competitiive advantage?</p>
<p>The only reason this is even in the news is because it&rsquo;s a middle school. Hispanic students are free to take AP spanish in any high school, just as speakers of numerous other languages can take AP coursework in those languages. Further most middle schools offer foreign languages anyway, so why not offer a higher level class for kids who can handle it? WOuld it be better for them to take beginner Spanish? </p>
<p>So if we are training an at risk populatiuon group upward and setting the bar higher for them at an earlier age, isn&rsquo;t this a good thing?</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re confusing cause and effect.  When you say that:</p>
<p><i>. AP classes are one of the best dropout prevention strategies that there is, as students who enroll in such classes almost always finish high school.</i></p>
<p>I suppose you think that every high school student should be made to take AP classes.  That way, they&rsquo;ll all finish high school.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an alternate explanation:  Students who take AP classes tend to be smarter to begin with, and therefore are more likely to finish high school anyway, AP classes or not.</p>

		<p>Um, they&rsquo;re not smarter to begin with, they have more academic preparation. This can be conferred by social position or can be acquired if students are properly channeled and incentivized.</p>
<p>Talk about a cause and effect snafu&hellip;taking what you say to its logical conclusion, whites are smarter than blacks to begin with, which explains why they take more AP classes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you think that&rsquo;s true, yet that&rsquo;s a logical inference one could make.</p>
<p>What getting middle school kids who come from humble origins does is give them a leg up on the playing field and teaches trains them to higher achievement and the value of hard work they might not otherwise have had the exposure to realize. I can&rsquo;t think of any way to make taking AP classes in HS more likely for this group of kids than taking AP exam when they are 12 and 13 years old.</p>

		<p>I have a friend who is Mexican by birth but came here to go to college 50+ years ago and has lived here ever since.  He is a PhD who, for many years, taught modern languages at a State College here in Chicago.</p>
<p>About 20 years he started a course of Spanish for the Spanish Speaking.  The students complained because he insisted that they use standard Spanish, rather than dialect, in class.  Eventually he was forced into early retirement.  These students wanted an easy credit; the last thing they wanted to learn was correct Spanish.</p>
