			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allan Hall, Daily Mail (London), February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Clint Eastwood {snip} says the world would be a better place if we could still laugh at inoffensive jokes about different races.</p>
<p>The Hollywood actor and director, 78, said we live in constant fear of being labelled racist for simply laughing about national stereotypes.</p>
<p>&#8216;People have lost their sense of humour,&rsquo; he told Germany&rsquo;s Der Spiegel magazine.</p>
<p>&#8216;In former times we constantly made jokes about different races.</p>
<p>&#8216;You can only tell them today with one hand over your mouth otherwise you will be insulted as a racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;It was normal that we made jokes based on our nationality or ethnicity. That was never a problem.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>&lsquo;You can only tell them today with one hand over your mouth otherwise you will be insulted as a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Way to go Mr. Eastwood, all the way; you even got the word &#8220;racist&#8221; correct. It is nothing but a petty insult, and a shut up word for the terminally stupid, and the perpetually aggrieved!</p>
<p>Again, way to go Mr. Eastwood!</p>
<p>Please all, enjoy this great Clint Eastwood clip; it is a perfect metaphor for &#8220;multicultural&#8221; life in the USA, 2009:</p>

			<p>The fact is jokes about different races have never stopped being made by people in the media.The problem is that only ones which is made fun of are white people.</p>

			<p>when I saw Eastwood&rsquo;s &#8216;Gran Torino&rsquo;, everybody in the audience was<br>
laughing as he let the racial slurs going flying. &#8220;Spooks&#8221; and &#8220;Gooks&#8221; and &#8220;Zipperheads&#8221;. (Notice I respectably capitalized the first letters). We are all different, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p>

			<p>The only programs I ever liked on BET were the stand-up comic programs.  Why?  Because the black comedians on those shows were <b>never</b> diffident about joking about race, including their fellow black people.<p>As an example, one such black comic, after assuring his &#8220;beautiful black brothers and sisters&#8221; how much he &#8220;loved&#8221; them, told them that nonetheless, &#8220;ain&rsquo;t no WAY&#8221; he would want a world run by black people.  His prime reason?  One would never get one&rsquo;s pizza delivered within any semblance of a reasonable time.  The overwhelmingly black audience roared its approval and appreciation of his insight.  Any white comic making the same joke would have ended his career the very instant he uttered those lines.</p></p>

<p>In <i>Unforgiven</i>, he cast Morgan Freeman as his best buddy and there&rsquo;s no mention of his blackness at all in the movie, from what I remember, much less any prejudice or the kind of language Clint&rsquo;s talking about.  One would think that would not be the case in Oklahoma right after the Civil War.  There&rsquo;s a scene where a Will&rsquo;s piss-n-vinegar hothead partner is cursing Freeman&rsquo;s character, and he refers to him as an SOB or somesuch.  I can think of something both less PC and more historically accurate for him to have called Freeman.  Then there&rsquo;s a scene where Freeman partakes of white prostitutes and nobody blinks, which I find unlikely at best.</p>
<p>So Eastwood insults our intelligence to be PC in at least one of his movies, but now he objects?  If so, he should come clean.  He did quite a bit of pandering with <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>, too, though it seems that was a bit of chaff so he could fly under enemy radar (TOJW is a very un-PC movie overall).</p>

			<p>Atty Gen Holder said we are &#8220;a nation of cowards&#8221; when it comes to race. He is wrong, but many white people have been shamed and cowed into a fear of being called &#8220;racist&#8221;. We must not compromise truth out of fear of the pc police.</p>

			<p> Reply to Question Diversity: You are on to something here.</p>
<p>Watch most of Eastwood&rsquo;s movies from the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s and you will see how he always had a black buddy and was very P.C. overall.</p>

			<p>Eastwood reminds me of another Hollywood &#8220;conservative&#8221;, Charlton Heston.  Heston was a raving civil rights lunatic in his youth.  He never made the connection between those social wedge issues and the ultimate growth and expansion of government into all areas of our life.  Eastwood is similar.  He may have conservative instincts, but what good does that do us this late in the game?  It would have been nice to hear this back in the seventies.  Of course, his Hollywood handlers back then would have thrown him to the lions.</p>

			<p>By making complaints or jokes about the tendencies of various races, instead of remaining silent, overall violence is eventually lessened, because people get a more accurate picture of the state of mind of their fellow men.  </p>
<p>When such statements are forbidden or socially punished to severely, it is the frustration due to a lack of understanding of each others sense of fair play and justice that causes much of the violence. At least when there are jokes and complaints made without fear, they can get a feel for each other&rsquo;s mindset, and truces and settlements tend to get made.</p>

			<p>Xenophon above: You are so correct. Heston was too stupid to realilze the assault on the Second Amendment and Right to own guns is caused by the Civil Rights he fought for while a young, vain and stupid actor.</p>
<p>The increase in crime, the protection of minorities, the special treatment of minorities and the constant demand and threats by minorities are behind the desire of the leadership to destroy the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Pre 1965 when America was naturally 95% WHITE, you could buy a gun anytime, anywhere and even through the mail. Noway today. With today&rsquo;s &#8220;equality&#8221; religion, we whites have FEWER rights in the country we founded and built. </p>
<p>Same with Eastwood. He sucked up to hollywood equality and &#8220;blacks are just like us&#8221; in his previous movies and now he wants to speak freely? We spoke FREELY in the 60&rsquo;s, as I remember.</p>
<p>Two races can not co-exist. Ever.</p>

			<p>Eastwood&rsquo;s portrayal of a black man as being completely accepted in &#8220;Unforgiven&#8221; is the only false note in an otherwise brilliant film, but it&rsquo;s so major that it almost ruins it for me.  Freeman would have been addressed as &#8220;N&#8221; throughout the story, even by people who really liked him, because that was just the way back then. I like Eastwood, but it was really spineless of him not to portray that accurately.  </p>
<p>Shame on you, Clint.<br>
 <br>
Also, Eastwood told Letterman last night that his next project will be about Nelson Mandela. Assuming it reaches completion, I&rsquo;ve already decided to give it a skip.</p>

			<p>I find it interesting that, on this website many people share their views of why liberals are wrong and that conservative/libertarian views are correct (myself included).  Yet how are we to win anyone over to our side if we don&rsquo;t allow for anyone to have made a mistake in the past?  So Heston and Eastwood were liberals back in the day and wanted government intervention in all of our social ills.  They are also people of Hollywood.  The fact that they became conservative at all is a miracle living in Hollywood!  Are we not to attain wisdom as we grow older.  As far as Eastwood not making movies anymore, have you seen Gran Torino?</p>

			<p>I recall once reading that the Soviet government, in the post-Stalin era, made it their business to keep up with the latest political jokes, because they wanted  insight into what people were really thinking.</p>

			<p> I discovered a long time ago; if you want to know the truth about what people are thinking; read ther magazines and publications.<br>
 Jet magazine opened my eyes to the truth about what the black race was thinkng. I haven&rsquo;t been surprised by anything that they&rsquo;ve done yet.<br>
 Political correctness has been a strong ally in their war on the white race. As long as we continue to bow to the false religion of &#8220;political correctness&#8221;; their power will continue to grow.<br>
 Political correctness needs to die. It will be the death knell of the white race if it does&rsquo;nt.</p>

			<p>Please let&rsquo;s not look for any leaders in Hollywood to Speak out for people, the truth.</p>
<p>Hollywood is completely alien territory. </p>
<p>At best we&rsquo;ll get some really old guy who finally feels he doesn&rsquo;t have to be PC anymore and some of his old fans will get excited, want to run him for president, want to support another old Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>No Thanks</p>
<p>We need a new start system, our stats, leaders can&rsquo;t come from Hollywood.</p>
<p>And please, let&rsquo;s not have anymore great hopes for Mel Gibson</p>

Yeah, let&rsquo;s see how heroic holder might be - let him walk through the other side of DC at night unarmed and with no SS or bodyguards to keep him from getting jacked.<br>
Sure, that&rsquo;ll happen.</p>

			<p>I agree with what Stateslave said; some people learn and grow, and there&rsquo;s no point in demonizing them. And its unfortunate that excellent, brave writers like Heather McDonald (City Journal) are bashed - they wouldn&rsquo;t be published at all if they were more outspoken than they already are.</p>

			<p>Even Clint, when talking about Gran Torino, said that he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about what he says because he was old.  Children and old people are the only groups of people that will be honest and tell you what&rsquo;s what.  It&rsquo;s the teens and adults that have to walk an eggshells because they have so much more to lose.</p>
