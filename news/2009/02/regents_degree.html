<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tough new requirements for high school diplomas could send city graduation rates plummeting, especially among poor and minority students, advocates said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Starting with this year&rsquo;s ninth graders, general education students will have to earn a Regents diploma to graduate, not the current less rigorous local degree.</p>
<p>Those requirements would have left nearly 10,000 of last year&rsquo;s graduates without a diploma, severely limiting their college and career options, according to a study by the Coalition for Educational Justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While graduation rates have risen in the past decade, only 37% of students earn a Regents degree, which requires passing five subject-specific exams with a score of 65 or higher.</p>
<p>Just 28% of African-American and 26% of Latino students earned that degree last year, while more than half of white students did. Only a third of students at high-poverty schools were awarded a Regents degree, the CEJ study showed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Department of Education is working with advocates to find ways to close the achievement gap, said Sabrina King, DOE chief academic officer.</p>

			<p>I noticed this was in the New York Times.  Not that we here at AR don&rsquo;t already realize this, but it has become even more the case that the NYT should be taken with a grain of salt.  PJB&rsquo;s latest column exposes the link between recent vitriol from the NYT about anti-invasion Patriots (even more than usual) and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim&rsquo;s purchase of a share of the Times.  Also, V-Dare exposed that the NYT and the SPLC have an interlocking directorship.  So, Slim = NYT = SPLC. </p>

			<p>As a product of the NYC school system, and recipient of a Regents scholarship many,many years ago,I am familiar with the Regents testing, etc. These requirements will not affect the graduation rate of poor and minority students, just the STUPID ones. If you choose to deal drugs on the corner or aspire to a career in rap, instead of studying and paying attention in class, you will not graduate. Not because you are poor or black.</p>

<p>Just give &#8216;em an extra X points if they are black or Y points if they are &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;, and claim that said points are to account for the &#8220;negative impact of poverty, poor parenting and white racism&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the problem:  you have to be smart to excel academically, and intelligence (like skin color, height, or lactose intolerance) is not distributed uniformly among different races. That is just the way nature is, and there is really little that we can do about it.  Some races can run and jump and other races can think and create.  </p>
<p>But, instead of simply accepting truth, our society will spend $ Billions and go through every possible contortion to maintain a lie.  </p>

			<p>wont be long before the blacks and latino&rsquo;s start crying &#8220;racism&#8221;.  The school board tries to raise the standard of education and people complain,  maybe the students actually have to attend school now, instead of out pedaling drugs.  On the other hand, arent black people magically smarter due to our new &#8220;leadership&#8221;.</p>

			<p> They&rsquo;ll just keep doing what they&rsquo;ve been doing. Since black<br>
and hispanics cannot keep up with White students. They will<br>
continue to dumb down the cirriculum, to ensure their idea<br>
of equality. An equality where all are to be equal in ignorance.</p>
<p> This is the reason why this country has become dumbed down.</p>

<p>So be it&hellip;.no more lowering standards in the name of the socialist agenda&hellip;enough is enough. Let them use their brain and make an effort to get the diploma&hellip;it is not a right or entitlement.</p>

			<p>in Europe, students are tracked by ability and given different types of training/education and correspondingly different degrees.</p>
<p>The Europeans are much less sentimental about &#8220;equality&#8221;: the result is well trained, confident, well paid workers, while the universities are less crammed with students who are bored and overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Vocational schools should be strengthened, academics are not for everyone. </p>

			<p>This article in this week&rsquo;s NY Post was more disconcerting to me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/02052009/news/regionalnews/ny_up_to_the_test_153633.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nypost.com/seven/02052009/news/regionalnews/ny_up_to_the_test_153633.htm</a></p>
<p>Note how white kids had the lowest increase. The article was cheery because all other groups increased much more but we have to nurture and support our own. No one else will.</p>

			<p>I took and passed these Regents Exams when I graduated from Poughkeepsie High School in the late 60s. I was surprised that they had stopped doing this. Standardized tests are a good idea so that we know where everyone stands. These tests won&rsquo;t be dumbed down the way high school curriculums are where they just pass unqualified students from grade to grade.</p>

			<p>To S &amp; GS:</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put much stock in those &#8220;results&#8221;. The article mentioned that the blacks and mestizos who accounted for the increase in the passing results were mostly from middle-level schools anyway. I doubt that the students in Harlem, Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant and South Bronx area schools suddenly got an educational epiphany.</p>

			<p>Instead of doing this as a collective effort, why don&rsquo;t we turn over black education to blacks and Mexican education to Mexicans?  That would free up Whites to set their own standards and allow minorities the same freedom.  Schools can be segregated by race and in places where one race is not the majority then the school could have two or three different administrations all with different curriculums and standards in the same building.  </p>
