<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D968V5VO0&amp;show_article=1">Midwife Births Raise Questions About Citizenship</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Sherman, AP, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The citizenship of hundreds, possibly thousands, of people who insist they are Americans is being called into question because they were delivered by midwives near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>The federal government&rsquo;s doubts have arisen as many people in the border region try to meet a June 1 deadline to obtain U.S. passports so they can freely cross from one country to the other.</p>
<p>The people delivered by midwives have documents such as birth certificates and medical records. But the agency that grants passports is challenging the credibility of those papers, citing a history of some midwives fraudulently registering Mexican-born babies as American.</p>
<p>The passport applications being questioned include those of children of Mexican women who crossed the border to give birth in the United States, and even employees of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency who were born on the border and now work to protect it.</p>
<p>The government has &#8220;effectively reduced to second-class citizenship status an entire swath of passport applicants based solely on their being of Mexican or Latino descent and having been delivered by midwives in nonhospital settings in Southwestern border states,&#8221; according to a federal lawsuit against the State Department filed last year in McAllen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1960, 75 Texas midwives have been convicted of fraudulently registering Mexican-born babies as American. At one point, the government assembled a list of nearly 250 &#8220;suspicious&#8221; midwives but never explained what made them suspicious.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the lawsuit is not resolved before June 1, families &#8220;will have to choose if you&rsquo;re going to live in Mexico or you&rsquo;re going to live in the U.S. You won&rsquo;t be able to cross,&#8221; said Lisa Brodyaga, another immigration attorney.</p>

			<p>Anchor babies are not US citizens no matter how you slice it.  Even if the 14th Amendment were valid, it wasn&rsquo;t mean to make anchor babies citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every Person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons.<br>
Senator Jacob Howard, Co-author of the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment, 1866.</p>

			<p>Alexandra:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so correct, the 14th is way over-interpreted.  The same Congress that did its part to ratify the 14th also made Washington DC public schools to be segregated.</p>

			<p>What you can expect from nationals of a country that is notorious for crime and corruption, who disrespect our border, culture, language, and laws?</p>
<p>They will cheat as much as they can get away with in order to avoid deportation and trick us into giving them welfare and free services.<br>
