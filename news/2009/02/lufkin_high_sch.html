<h1><a href="https://www.kltv.com/Global/story.asp?S=9829385&amp;nav=1TjD">Lufkin High School Class Sparks Concerns of Segregation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KLTV (Tyler, Texas), February 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some people say it is tailored education, but some concerned parents call it segregation. Lufkin High School is pushing for a course offered only to African American females. Despite the controversy, school authorities say that it may end up benefitting students.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all you have to be black and second of all, but equally as important, you have to be female. It&rsquo;s only for black female students&#8221; said John Mitchell, the Language Arts Facilitator of LISD. &#8220;And, it will always be only for black females.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pilot Black Female Literature Course has some questioning why other students couldn&rsquo;t benefit from the course, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re targeting certain students, trying to get them interested, trying to get them to understand their culture as they relate to it,&#8221; Mitchell explained.</p>
<p>In the past, Lufkin High School has introduced black literature in English classes, but not without problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe someday we&rsquo;ll have a black studies course that will include white children, that they can come into and learn, but right now, that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re targeting. We&rsquo;re targeting black students to give them a place in the academic system to where they can realize the the importance of their own culture.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to meet the kind of dippy parents that would want their children to take a class about literature written by black women.  Is the work of Toni Morrison that important?</p>

			<p>If blacks want to exclude anyone, let them. Just give the same right of exclusion to whites and everyone else.</p>

			<p>Awesome! The idoiocracy running the public schools doing our work for us - segregate, segregate, segregate! And then remember well the details of it and be prepared to throw it back into the face of all who cry &#8220;discrimination&#8221; at anything and everything that may not - for whatever reason - include Blacks! </p>

<p>Hmmm:<br>
Y&rsquo;know, if there are any &#8220;no-racers&#8221;, or &#8220;anti/non-racists&#8221;, reading this - can you please explain why &#8220;culture&#8221; is <b>directly</b> linked to &#8220;race&#8221; in non-whites, yet an immigrant from China can learn English, memorise Beowulf and recite 5 historical kings of England and can be declared &#8220;culturally English&#8221;?</p>
<p>But outside the blatant hypocrisy here, I can&rsquo;t really say that exclusion from this &#8220;Black Female Literature&#8221; course will be bad for non-black students.</p>

			<p>White kids should be relieved that they are not required to endure this waste of time.<br>
What I do object to is the use of taxpayer funds for this nonsense.  They can teach their &#8220;culture&#8221; on their own time and on their own dime.</p>

<b>&#8220;tailored education&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Good heavens. Whenever I think I&rsquo;ve heard it all, they come up with a new term. Now black supported educational segregation is called &#8216;tailored education&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Add this one to &#8216;strivers&rsquo;, &#8216;non-traditional learning&rsquo;, and &#8216;serial monogamy&rsquo;.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We&rsquo;re targeting black students to give them a place in the academic system to where they can realize the importance of their own culture.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Good luck with that. Get back to me in four years and show me your success rate. My guess is that it will be on par with every previous program to raise black educational standards.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with segregation? That&rsquo;s what black history month is. Well, actually, it&rsquo;s not even segregation at all since white student have Nothing.</p>

			<p>At the risk of sounding like the proverbial broken record, if the class was offered to white males or white females only the outcry would be heard from here to the white house! </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t the purpose of this class to give these black girls all A&rsquo;s for no effort and no real learning?  They can also mention this class in their application for university to define their race so they will be sure to get an AA admission.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s important about living a stone age existence for 5000 years?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it hypocritical to say we&rsquo;re all the same under the skin then try to instill in certain races the idea that their different?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a racial tiger by the tail and they&rsquo;re fighting a useless battle that is based on lies.<br>

<p>I have no problem with this Mr Mitchell. The question is do you have a problem with classes targeted towards and limited to white students? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a &#8220;no-racer,&#8221; but you&rsquo;ve got a good point: there must be millions of Asians who have learned English and adopted English given names and assimilate to various white/European cultures (from Canadian to German to Argentinian   &mdash;   the Chinese in Africa apparently do not assimilate).  </p>
<p>How many whites have moved to China, Japan or Korea, learned the native language, adopted foreign customs, and taken an Asian given name?  Drop the &#8220;David&#8221; and go by &#8220;Dai-wei&#8221;?  And called themselves &#8220;Asian&#8221;?  Maybe 3?  4?  Is anyone aware of a single one?</p>

			<p>Anytime one group is excluded from participating it is defacto segregation. Only this time it is the blacks that are closing the doors on the whites. I am struck by the fact that blacks really cannot learn at levels whites do. </p>

IF it means also: let there be classes for whites, unmolested by non-whites, to learn about their cultural heritage.  </p>

<p>Once again that is sterotyping. People here talk about blacks as if they understand every single individual person. In my first year of college I saw blacks make it on the honor roll, get academic awards, and take honors classes. They came from bad neighborhoods and bad countries. But they had a good work ethic and a good study habit that is why they were successful. Not all blacks deserve to be lumped in with the bad ones the white dont deserve to be label.</p>
<p>This article is extremely unimportant. It simply wants blacks to no about the good side of poetry and not the kind they get from rap music. This will help them understand a bigger world of poetry and not just rap music. </p>
<p>QUESTION: WOULD YOU RATHER THEM LISTEN TO TUPAC, 50CENT, JAY-Z, ICE CUBE, ICE T, DR. DRE, OR ANY OTHER GANSTER RAPPER OUT THERE?</p>

			<p>They should offer a set of courses in &#8220;Western science, mathematics, technology, philosophy, and politics&#8221; solely for white males as well, so that white males can understand and appreciate their own culture.  </p>
<p>Let the black students try to develop their own course on black versions of the above.  I would like to see that.</p>

I had a colleague who spent several years in China studying Wing Tsun from Yip Man himself (Bruce Lee´s master who fell out with him when he went commercial), and after he finished his MSc here he went back to teach. And my old Latin prof spent a decade teaching there (spanning the Cultural Revolution. The stories he told&hellip;). And he was fluent in ten Chinese dialects. But I agree this is exceedingly rare. Chinese are not very welcoming.</p>
<p>- As for those &#8220;classes&#8221;, if they agree to have them recorded and scrutinized by adult white males, I´d have little problem with them. But we know this is exactly what is not going to happen.<br>
The way I see it is something like this:<br>
They have written off black males as uneducable (duh) and now want to create an army of &#8220;community organizers&#8221; (read: shakedown artists) at taxpayers´expense. Of course, we must not be in on their schemes.</p>

this is anecdote. Sir Karl Popper taught us that stochastic statements (translation: those based on probability) are not in the strict sense falsifiable (his previous definition of &#8220;scientific&#8221;) but may nonetheless (more or less honorary) considered scientific if they are empirical (=based on observation).</p>
<p>Translation of above blather into plain English:<br>
The sentence &#8220;Ravens are black&#8221; is not rendered false, moot or worthless by the occasional white one.</p>
<p>Sorry, but unlike most of my colleagues I didn´t sleep through science theory (g).</p>
