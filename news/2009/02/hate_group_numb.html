			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, SPLC, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of hate groups operating in the United States continued to rise in 2008 and has grown by 54 percent since 2000  &mdash;  an increase fueled last year by immigration fears, a failing economy and the successful campaign of Barack Obama, according to the &#8220;Year in Hate&#8221; issue of the SPLC&rsquo;s Intelligence Report released today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two new factors were introduced to the volatile hate movement in 2008: the faltering economy and the Obama campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barack Obama&rsquo;s election has inflamed racist extremists who see it as another sign that their country is under siege by non-whites,&#8221; said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report, a quarterly investigative journal that monitors the radical right. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Extremists are also exploiting the economic crisis, spreading propaganda that blames minorities and immigrants for the subprime mortgage meltdown. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The issue examines the widespread media reporting of a false claim that undocumented immigrants held 5 million bad mortgages and were, therefore, responsible for the subprime mortgage crisis.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not that new &#8220;hate groups&#8221; started, it&rsquo;s that, over time, the SPLC has an increasingly loose definition of &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;group,&#8221; so that each year, more and more existing groups can qualify as &#8220;hate groups&#8221; in their lexicon.</p>
<p>Also, who is to say that most of these &#8220;groups&#8221; actually exist?  Be, for an example, the CEO of a major conservative national organization, especially one that deals with racial issues in a conservative way, and you&rsquo;re going to be on everyone&rsquo;s mail list, and by &#8220;everyone,&#8221; I mean everyone on the racial right wing.  Most of the organizations that the SPLC claims to exist, you&rsquo;ll never get any mail from.  How does the SPLC know they exist when right-wing professional activists have never heard of them?  Either the Center is making stuff up, or through several intermediaries they&rsquo;re having people dress up in funny uniforms.</p>
<p>We know that a certain bent cross group in Florida was led and organized by an FBI informant, including public marches and rallies.  Most of their members were probably FBI, too.  Meaning no FBI, no bent cross group.  The infamous 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black girls   &mdash;   FBI informants, dressed up in funny uniforms.  The reason is obvious   &mdash;   when LBJ wants civil rights laws, when ADL/SPLC want money, all sorts of bombs are going to go off somewhere.</p>

			<p>Well, I mean, if that icon of integrity, The Southern Poverty Law Center says that &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; are up, then who are Americans to question them? The truth is, it is exactly European Americans who should be question them, and questioning them, and questioning them more. However, as individuals it will accomplish nothing, like a fork hitting water. As a united group it would stop these abusers of basically European Americans  &mdash;  cold. That is who they are forvever focused on.</p>

			<p>This is soooo depressing. &#8220;Hate group&#8221; membership should be up by way more than 54%! 80,000%, here we come!</p>
<p>The SPLC has decided to define deviancy down. Where &#8220;hate group members&#8221; used to mean violent, ignorant thugs like Klansmen and skinheads, today they consider anyone with a valid critique of mass immigration, multiculturalism and/or affirmative action to be a member of a hate group. Gotta keep those contributions flowing in&hellip;</p>

How many groups are actually individuals?</p>
<p>We had an incident in which a &#8216;group&rsquo; sent questionable mail. When they tracked down the &#8216;group&rsquo;, it was one person.</p>
<p>These people define &#8216;hate group&rsquo; as any individual with a computer, a printer, and access to envelopes and a mailbox.</p>

			<p>i wonder if that 54% includes any new readers of hate sites like American Renaissance and VDare? i kid. seriously though, considering how groups like $PLC consider anyone who so much as criticizes minorities a hater, then we should have plenty more people who are willing to stand up for America and their white heritage when the next election comes.</p>

			<p> Behold the Gospel according to the SPLC. What is a hate group? Why, any organization that doesn&rsquo;t agree with the SPLC&rsquo;s multi-culti, extreme liberal, Whites-are-always-to-blame philosophy, of course!</p>
<p> The gall of this White-bashing, minority-loving gang is just incredible. They act as if the sun rising and sets on their opinions about what constitutes &#8220;hate.&#8221; That is one of the favorite words of the left wing in this country. It&rsquo;s greatly aided and abetted by large segments of the news media who parrot the term &#8220;hate group&#8221; without even a hint of quotes, as if all and sundry were 100 percent agreed as to what it means. </p>

			<p>A famous person once said &#8220;hate is good - as long as you&rsquo;re hating that which is hateful&#8221; or something of that nature.  I do subscribe to that philosophy.  There is nothing wrong with being a hater or a member of a &#8220;hate group&#8221; as long as your hatred is directed toward that which is worthy of being hated.</p>

			<p>By the ludicrous SPLC&rsquo;s criteria, basically the entire Western world was one enormous &#8220;Hate Group&#8221; only a couple generations ago. Americans and others should think long and hard about this, before they listen to these vile scoundrels!  </p>

			<p>I wonder if anyone at SPLC has ever sat down with anyone and had an intellectually honest conversation regarding black on white crime or illegal immigration.  I get the impression that they only communicate through press releases and articles.  As someone who has lived in California almost my entire life I have seen immigration, both legal and illegal up close.  Being southerners, I get the impression that the SPLC are newbys regarding Latino&rsquo;s and immigration.  They basically parrot the LaRaza talking points and think the rest of us are so stupid that we should swallow their story hook line and sinker.    </p>

			<p>I sometimes correct my wife when she says that she hates something, by telling her that &#8220;hate&#8221; is a very strong reaction or fear, and what she really means is that she is concerned or objects to what she is referring to. </p>
<p>The war of words is a powerful propaganda tool where words or theories repeated often cause ignorant people to have it branded on their minds and to accept it or the treatise without questioning it especially when they are afraid of being called racist by people who are in fact often racist themselves.</p>
<p>I am retired in Spain where ther are a reported 1/2 million other British people retired or working here now and far too many are the liberal fools who apout out their theorie without in most cases hving any actual experinecof te situations.</p>
<p>For example, many think tha African blacks (as opposed to African whites, Indians, etc) are wonderful people because their next door neigbours in te UK were Jamaican people who were born in the UK and are basically British in their culture.  I can see the sense in thsi but when I tell them that they are being racist forn the are saying that worldwide all black skinned people are just like the lovey Jamaicans, something even many Jamaicans will not agree with, they get very belligerent and accuse me of racist ranting.  One a reporteed university orofessor in socoila studies(that says it all) has been the worst here.  He and his silly wife) expect all around him to accept his theories as the gospel truth and will not debate the facts as being proven every day by people like Mugabe and many others on the continent where I lived for 24 years.</p>
<p>So we must keep writing to the Press as I do and I am finding others who are like myself, not fanatics but just grey haire and so have experince of life and worried about how basic rights such as freedom of (reasonable) speech are being refused by these self-professed but flawed, academics.</p>
<p>One new fact is that the local Press and English language radio stations are having to cut back due to falling advertising income and one radio statyion I have a spot on every month for my speciality. the laws on motoring in Spain, in English, is cutting out music ostensibly i believe to reduce music royalty payments, I guess, and is now converting to &#8220;talk-radio&#8221;. so I am hoping to be able to join in with discussions on these subjects of immigration and race around the world.  They will be able to be phoned via the Internet, and can be listened to by te same medium and the web site will be changing soon I guess to reflect the new programme matters.  The current station web-site is www.rem.fm.  I am hoping that they will have the courage to air fully these subjects as in the UK many are very cowardly about being non-PC, but te Spanish are not so tongue-tied.</p>
<p>God bless America, and thanks to the USA (and Britain, etc) Iraq is a far better place now as will be Afghanistan in a few years   &mdash;   we all hope.  No genocidal monsters or murdering dictators in charge.</p>

			<p>I am not impressed with most of these groups on the SPLC list, but the anti-immigrant groups look pretty straight up. I doubt is Save Our State and American Patrol are racist groups. And FAIR surely is not a racist groups. The SPLC is nuts. Any group opposing illegal immigration is actually the same as neo-Nazis! </p>
<p>Heck, I&rsquo;m about ready to join one of these anti-illegal groups right now. I&rsquo;d so love to be an official member of one of these &#8220;hate&#8221; groups. We need to take the sting out of these words. We need to print up buttons and bumper stickers that say, &#8220;Proud Member of a hate group - Save Our State.&#8221; Wear them around and dare the Hispanic traitors to kick our rear ends. It&rsquo;s like what the gays did. They didn&rsquo;t like the word &#8220;queer&#8221; so they just embraced it as their own and took the sting out.</p>

			<p>So, let me get this straight, if I point out that the economy is faltering, and I don&rsquo;t like Obama, and I point out that a large percentage of defaulting loans are from minorities (all of which is true)&hellip;. I&rsquo;m a &#8220;HATE GROUP&#8221;?  </p>
<p>hhmmm.  Maybe I should work on coming up with a cool name now that I&rsquo;m a HATE GROUP.  Something that sounds like I&rsquo;m important, but fighting for the common man, but allows me to seek money from the public trough&hellip;. I got it!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that they track them down so quickly, and there are so many, yet others they miss entirely. Could it be easier tracking them down when the hate groups themselves are run by fellow leftists who have an agenda of their own? An infiltration/control/propaganda and monitoring agenda perhaps? An agenda that&rsquo;s fully supported by the literature put out at our major universities by the way. </p>

			<p>Wow, this just get&rsquo;s more obvious everyday. Because of stuff that relatively few whites did 100+ years ago, today all white people are required to bend over backward to non-white interest, if we try to resist we are &#8216;haters&rsquo;. I have a feeling that whites will wake up to this in the next few decades.</p>

			<p>The SPLC has absolutely no credibility. They&rsquo;re nothing more than a hate organization that focuses racial hatred towards whites. The SPLC turns a blind eye to the hundreds of different gang organizations in this nation, which aren&rsquo;t white and openly attack whites.</p>

			<p>The old &#8220;joke&#8221; among radical groups in the 1960s and 1970s was &#8220;How can you tell which person in your group is the FBI agent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s always trying to get you to bomb something.&#8221;</p>
<p>The term &#8220;hate group&#8221; is every bit as silly as Shrubya&rsquo;s mythical &#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221;.  What is &#8220;evil&#8221;?  Anything the speaker doesn&rsquo;t like.  This Shrubya&rsquo;s &#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221; was an artificial agglomeration of everyone our former First Dingbat didn&rsquo;t like, whether they were actively conspiring with each other or not (I wonder what his take on drunk drivers is.  Certainly they seem overrepresented in his &#8220;Mexican family values&#8221;.  Evil?  Hmmm.)  Likewise a &#8220;hate group&#8221; is any organization that is opposed to something.  Are you a member of an organization opposed to foreigners who willingly violate our immigration laws in order to come here and force down wages?  Presto: You&rsquo;re a &#8220;hater&#8221;.  Are you a member of an organization opposed to offshore oil drilling?  Guess what?  You&rsquo;re also potentially a &#8220;hater&#8221;.  Are you a member of an organization like the SPLC and ADL that hates &#8220;hate&#8221; groups?  You&rsquo;re a hater, too. </p>
<p>I am going to create a new category of organization.  Since we already have &#8220;hate&#8221; groups, the new category will be &#8220;Chicken Little Groups&#8221;.  A Chicken Little Group is any organization that dishonestly hypes a non-existant or nearly non-existant problem as far out of proportion as possible, in order to boost donations from a gullible public.  Do we know of any organizations like this?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d sure like to see the SPLC&rsquo;s counting methods. As other posters have suggested, an org as divorced from reality as the SPLC is bound to define &#8220;hate group&#8221; in the broadest imaginable terms   &mdash;   including individuals. It&rsquo;s quite possible that Potok and his co-conspirators count every single person who posts here at AR as their very own private &#8220;group.&#8221; </p>
<p>A group of one. </p>
<p>Accordingly, I&rsquo;m not impressed by that super-scary sounding &#8220;54% increase.&#8221; I suspect that I alone represent at least 10% of it. </p>

<p>I would imagine so.  And because many reporters are left-wing anyway, they believe the SPLC and ADL at face value.  And, since some of them are lazy, they&rsquo;ll do the Ctrl-C-Alt-Ins from splcenter.org into Indesign.  More than that, VDare found that the New York Times corporation (includes the Boston Globe) and the SPLC have a Board of Director member in common.</p>

<p>No,no, a thousand times no.  He is not half-white.  He is all black.  It has to do with recessive and dominant genes.  His mother was little more than a petri dish. Her 23 chromosomes were needed to create a new human being with 46 chromosomes, but the genes on her chromosomes are lost to the white gene pool and her family line has now returned to Africa. Her line is extinct.</p>
