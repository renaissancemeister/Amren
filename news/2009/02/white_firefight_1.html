<h1>White Firefighter to Get a Trial on Bias Claim</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nancy Bartley, Seattle Times, February 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Seattle firefighter who was the top scorer on a promotional test but was denied promotion, while a lower-scoring African-American co-worker was promoted, has won his appeal and will have a trial in his case against the city.</p>
<p>Court of Appeals Division I this week reversed a King County Superior Court summary judgment and found in favor of Kevin Dumont, a white firefighter for the city of Seattle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2003 Dumont scored 99 on the Civil Service test and received an additional 6 points for in-service qualifications, for 105 out of a possible 110, highest of any candidates for promotion, according to the Court of Appeals documents.</p>
<p>But he was passed over for the job as fireboat engineer in favor of Eric Lanier. Lanier, court documents say, scored 83.9 on the test but received the maximum 10 points for in-service qualifications for a total of 93.9, which ranked him third on the promotion list.</p>
<p>Then-Fire Chief Gary Morris interviewed Lanier and Dumont, who both worked as deckhands on the fire boat, and promoted Lanier. He did so, court documents say, after Initiative 200 went into effect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to court documents, Dumont had no disciplinary complaints in his file, but Lanier&rsquo;s personnel file showed he had been subjected to official discipline 17 times during his career, including two suspensions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before Dumont filed his lawsuit, Morris made 45 promotions to competitive positions, promoting the top-scoring applicant on the Civil Service Commission list in 41 of the 45 instances.</p>
<p>In the other four instances, the promoted person was a racial or ethnic minority, while the top-scoring person was a white male, court documents say.</p>

			<p>What color is Morris.  Seems that is relevant.  Based on his &#8220;rationale&#8221; why have the tests?</p>

			<p>I hope doctors are not promoted the same way firemen get promoted in this country, or airline pilots, jeez, when I think about it I really don&rsquo;t want any profession to promote that way, especially firefighters</p>

It&rsquo;s like a friend of mine who took a civil service test and works for the county and who takes tests for promotions said &#8216;if you score high on the test, they&rsquo;re only required to interview you. They&rsquo;re not required to hire you simply because you have the highest score&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve found a way around hiring those who get the high scores.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect any justice from the courts in this matter.  The cards are stacked against the white man in today&rsquo;s America.  The only way justice and liberty can be won is the way Americans got it the first time around against the British.</p>

<p>Sounds like another professional, upstanding member of the African American community. The real question is why someone like this hasn&rsquo;t fired apart, of course, from the fact that he&rsquo;s black.</p>

<p>I should think it is because the ruling authorities are also black.</p>

			<p>This Dumont character has been disciplined 17 times in his career?! And the department wants to promote him?!</p>
<p>How did this guy ever keep his job in the first place?! Unbelieveable!</p>

			<p>Private companies will soon feel the same wrath and before long, every European will be under the thumb of a non-white who, statistically, is less intelligent, motivated and qualified.</p>
<p>And white Liberals make those laws.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve taken the postal exam for employment 5 times in 5 different regions of the country.  The first 4 times I never scored below a 95 in any of the tests.  The last time I took the test was in Louisville KY and the woman who administered the test was black.  When I got the results in the mail I was shocked to see the score was only 70.  It was pretty much the same material as in any of the other exams so it made me pretty suspicious that maybe she was erasing my answers and changing them before submitting them for grading.</p>

			<p>This is nothing new.  Twenty years ago, I applied for OCS(Officers Candidate School) while enlisted in the US military.  I had extremely strong test scores and a bachelors degree in Economics from a well known and top-ranking university.  Additionally, I scored perfect scores on my PFT(Physical Fitness Test) and was honor man(highest test scores) in all(5 total) of the military training courses which I attended. When I submitted my OCS package, the Colonel reviewing it said &#8220;This is one of the best packages I&rsquo;ve seen in some time.  You should have no problem getting a slot in OCS&#8221;.  Four months later when my application came back rejected, I went to that same officer and asked him why.  His reply?  &#8220;Son, you are just a plain old white boy.  They are looking for minorities right now&#8221;.  After seeing barely literate blacks being actively recruited and given officer training slots, I decided that I would complete my initial term of enlistment and get out. It was the best thing I ever did in my life.  </p>

			<p>Look at it this way, IF we didn&rsquo;t allow minorities especially black to move ahead although they are not qualified, almost no black would have any job where qualifications and expertise were required. All you have to do is look to the white house to prove this is a fact?</p>

<p>In NY State Civil Service they have a rule of 3, that is they have to promote from the top 3. One way to get around this and make a more &#8220;diverse&#8221; workforce is to have provisional appointments. In this case no list is used but if a person is hired or promoted a passing grade is to be earned whenever (or if) a test is given.</p>
<p>Of course another way to ensure a diverse workforce (that is where non-whites are promoted over more qualified whites) is through shear attrition due to an inhospitable work environment. Where I work the number and extent of Black History Month, Martin Luther King food drives and book drives (I should drop a copy of Color of Crime in this bin), and Obamalama calendars and posters and fawning, etc is enough to beat a proud white persons spirit.  </p>

			<p>Racial preference seeps into all governments run by liberals, it provides them bragging points to each other about being &#8220;progressive,&#8221; while also assuaging their own preposterously assumed guilt.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of illogical results inflicted on the general public whenever they empower society&rsquo;s leftist imates to run the asylum. </p>

			<p>It like this in the corporate world as well. Although we don&rsquo;t have such formal tests. But they don&rsquo;t get the best person for the job, they get whoever will help them fullfill their diversity quota.</p>

			<p>This is why many employers use a &#8220;requirement&#8221; for a &#8220;college degree&#8221; even for jobs that require &#8220;expertise&#8221;.  I can count many times that I have been denied a technical position because I lack a &#8220;college degree&#8221;.  Since &#8220;aptitude tests&#8221; have been outlawed by the so-called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws, a &#8220;college degree&#8221; is used as a &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221;.  This is actually counterproductive because it keeps out qualified individuals.<br>
The federal government is especially dependent on the use of &#8220;college degrees&#8221; to gain employment.  The funny thing is that it does not matter what field of study the &#8220;degree&#8221; is in.  They will hire the person with the &#8220;degree&#8221;.</p>

<p>I sure hope this gets heard before Obama gets a chance to appoint any Supreme Court justices.  What he&rsquo;ll do to the Supreme Court is the scariest aspect of his whole presidency.</p>

			<p>My roommate in college (beautiful tall blond girl) was mentioning one day that her paternal grandfather was from Panama. I told her she should go down to the minority affairs office; I was sure they&rsquo;d hand her some money. She didn&rsquo;t think she was &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; but went ahead anyway&hellip; and came back with a $500 grant. </p>
<p>You can be sure we all combed our backgrounds for some sort of minority blood so we could try to get some free money too. </p>

<p>This is true in the government contracting world too. Often, a requirement is to have been in the military as E-7 or above enlisted or O-5 and above for Officers and I have pointed out that this is not always the best way to get QUALIFIED and EXPERIENCED people to fill positions. I don&rsquo;t think anyone heard me!!</p>
