<h1>As U.S. Job Opportunities Fade, More Mexicans Look Homeward</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miriam Jordan, Wall Street Journal, February 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>During a decade in the U.S., Mexican immigrant Linex Rivera gave birth to three daughters, whose American citizenship offered her hope of staying in the land of opportunity. But with job prospects drying up for her husband, Ms. Rivera last week joined a phalanx of compatriots at the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles inquiring about obtaining Mexican citizenship for their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thinking of returning to Mexico and want our daughters to have all the rights of Mexican nationals,&#8221; says Ms. Rivera, whose children are nine, five and three.</p>
<p>After a historic immigration wave, many Mexicans and other Latin Americans are preparing to return to their homelands amid the deepening recession here. Mexicans who reside in the U.S. sought Mexican citizenship for their U.S.-born children in record numbers last year.</p>
<p>Unemployment Hits Hispanics</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for foreign-born Hispanics hit 8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 5.1% in the same quarter a year earlier, according to the report by the Pew Hispanic Center. Read the report.</p>
<p>The recession is hitting Hispanic immigrants especially hard, according to a new report by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization. The unemployment rate for foreign-born Hispanics hit 8% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 5.1% in the same quarter a year earlier. During the same period, the unemployment rate for all U.S. workers climbed to 6.5% from 4.6%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of people caught trying to sneak into the U.S. along the border with Mexico is at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. While some of the drop-off is the result of stricter border enforcement, the weaker U.S. economy is likely the main deterrent. Border Patrol agents apprehended 705,000 people attempting to enter the U.S. illegally in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30. That is down from 858,638 a year before and from 1.1 million two years earlier.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;We believe it is a myth that a lot of Mexicans are going back,&#8221; said a Mexican diplomat in Washington, who asked to remain anonymous. &#8220;But given the economic situation, some of them might be considering it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A host of metrics suggest they are considering it seriously. Between January and September last year, 32,517 Mexicans registered their U.S.-born children for Mexican citizenship at a Mexican consulate, compared with 28,687 for all 2007 and 20,791 in 2006. The 2008 total is likely to be more than 35,000, according to Mexican consular officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Mexican citizenship has its own benefits. Having Mexican nationality entitles U.S.-born children of immigrants to obtain health care, education and other benefits, as well as the right to vote, in Mexico. Mexican nationals also don&rsquo;t face restrictions on land and business ownership that apply to foreigners.</p>
<p>Mexican consulates also report they have experienced a spike in applications for a &#8220;personal-effects permit&#8221; that entitles its nationals to transfer their household goods to Mexico without paying import duties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, applications for the &#8220;matricula consular,&#8221; an identity card that Mexicans in the U.S. need to open bank accounts and conduct other business, such as rent an apartment, appear to be declining. Through the first nine months of 2008, 689,150 Mexican adults had applied for the identity card nationwide. That compares with 947,000 for all of 2006.</p>

		<p>Just wondering, but who paid the birthing (hospital) costs for Linex Rivera? Mr. and Mrs. Rivera or the U.S. taxpayers? Sorry for sounding cynical, but every hospital E.R. room in our area is packed with Mexican immigrants demanding and getting free healthcare.</p>
<p>I am &#8216;fed up&rsquo; with the misplaced sympathy for illegal immigrants. They never belonged in our country in the first place.  The crimes too many commit when here. The lifestyle (squallor, overcrowded dwellings, DWI caused accidents, trashing and dragging down the quality of the neighborhoods they settle in).</p>

<i>&ldquo;We are thinking of returning to Mexico and want our daughters to have all the rights of Mexican nationals,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The operative words here are &#8216;we are THINKING&rsquo; of returning to Mexico.</p>
<p>Where would these people be better off unemployed? In the US or Mexico?</p>
<p>Only a handful might leave. The rest will ride it out. There are enough social programs to get them through. Few are going to give up what they have to return to even less in Mexico. </p>

		<p> They&rsquo;re not going anywhere. Their are loads of sanctuary cities that would cater to them. They would be better off here than in Mexico. Looks like we&rsquo;re stuck with them.</p>

		<p>Article 30 of the Mexican Federal Constitution states that any person born abroad with at least ONE Mexican parent is a Mexican citizen. I suggest we recognize that fact and admit that these are by no means US Citizens, being subject to foreign jurisdiction. This anchor baby nonsense must end.</p>

		<p>How hard would it be for an American to get Mexican citizenship. I have a feeling that it would be pretty damned hard. Still. </p>
<p>And since, as La Raza asserts, Mexican&rsquo;s are a nationality, a &#8216;cosmic race,&rsquo; rather than a race, that would make me a Mexican, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t I then be able to come back to the states and get into the grad school of my choice, as a Mexican?  </p>

		<p>On a realistic note&hellip; bet the farm damned few illegals are actually returning to Mexico. They&rsquo;re here to stay, thanks to our asinine welfare hand-outs, not to mention FREE (as in paid by us, the American taxpayers) healthcare, education, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Now WHO among is is gullible enough to suggest illegals don&rsquo;t qualify for or get welfare supplements or food stamps? If you want an answer, go to your nearest welfare/social security office. Check the English language fluency of the Latinos seeking help.</p>
<p>If they can get JOBS in our country, despite being illegals, they can get welfare. Using the same techniques of fraudulent documentation, false social security numbers, and claiming as many kids as they can think of claiming. By the way, who would DARE reject illegals for welfare hand-outs? The immigration advocates and liberal do-gooders would be screaming to the local newspapers trying to elecit sympathy for poor Senora Diego&hellip; stuck with her eight ninos while papasito is nowhere to be found. Having run off with a younger woman.</p>

		<p>The problem, as always, is not the Mexicans but our damn sell-out politicians who want their votes. If somehow the Mexicans were a problem for politicians they&rsquo;d be all kinds of border fences &amp; immigration controls - all in the name of what&rsquo;s best for the USA, of course.</p>

		<p>A White boy scout, aged about 10 or 11, came to my door alone today and asked if he could put an American flag in my yard. His scout troup was conducting a drive in my neighborhood. 20 years ago, I would have said certainly and helped him plant it. I might have done the same even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Today, knowing the corruption that has seized America and the Boy Scouts, I told the lad, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, but no.&#8221; He looked dejected and I felt terrible for him. </p>
<p>I wanted to explain to him the dozen of political reasons why I wanted nothing to do with the Boy Scouts and that it was not his fault. I wanted to tell him that he is a part of an organization that embraces deviancy and homosexuals; an organization that has said that Hispanic invaders are paramount for their future! I knew he would not understand. I just closed the door.</p>
<p>What a terrible situation America faces! That boy suffers because of it. He grows up in a country that has betrayed him and his future. A country that has robbed him of the true comraderie of being a Boy Scout in a White country; one with high standards and honest family values!</p>
<p>I was a Boy Scout once. We were all White and none our leaders were real men with Christian families, not homosexuals.</p>
<p>Today, I say screw the Boy Scout &#8220;leadership&#8221; and screw the American flag! It&rsquo;s a flag that is shamed everyday by Democrats, Republicans, radicals, and every manner of egalitarians and marxists! The country is ruined!!! It will become much, much worse.</p>

		<p>No American leader talks about the implication of allowing millions of immigrants from Mexico, a country with a long record of hostility to the United States. Immigration from Mexico belongs to a category all its own. Mexico&rsquo;s elites dream of converting the southwest into a part of Greater Mexico. The recent soccer game between the US and Mexico shows that NAFTA has failed to bring the two countries closer. No amount of trade treaties and immigration can bridge the irreconcilable gulf between United States and Mexico.</p>
