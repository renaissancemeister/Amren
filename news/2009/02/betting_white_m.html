<h1>Betting White Men Can Learn</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t know what to make of [Chuck] Shelton himself. When I met him the other day, he was wearing a dark suit, his hair was short and well-groomed, very corporate. And he was talking about race.</p>
<p>[His book &#8220;Leadership 101 for White Men&#8221;] is subtitled, &#8220;How to Work Successfully with Black Colleagues and Customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He writes that white men hold 80 percent of the senior leadership positions in America, yet those white executives are just a fraction of the total work force.</p>
<p>Given what the rest of the work force looks like (and all those potential customers), it makes sense that white men ought to know how to play well with others.</p>
<p>Shelton focuses on the relationship with black people because that&rsquo;s what he knows best and because it is a particularly long and challenging relationship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He knows white men. And he told me he has spent much of his life learning about and from black people.</p>
<p>His mother was a Head Start volunteer in the early 1960s. {snip}</p>
<p>In 1967, when he was 13, he attended a racial-reconciliation workshop in Seattle and learned three important things from a black speaker, the Rev. Woodie White:</p>
<p>&#8220;Black people resent being viewed as a &#8216;problem&rsquo; when white people are often the main problem black folks have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black people tire of the expectation they should teach white people about race:</p>
<p>&#8220;White people must learn how to accept responsibility for being white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The book, which came out in January, talks about the advantages that go with being white and male, the tension between being honest and being respectful, the illusion of colorblindness.</p>

			<p>Black people really are a problem to white people because they depend on us for so much of their well being and prosperity, and not the other way around.Why cant blacks form corporations the same way whites and others do?Because developing a buisness that can stand on its own feet and make a profit requires honesty, dedication, discipline,and a good work ethic, something that blacks have never had, even if that fact is not their own fault.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to not think of the black community as a &#8220;problem to be solved&#8221; when the black community looks to Whites to solve all their problems. (Consider, for example, an article in today&rsquo;s AmRen postings about the NAACP asking what Obama will do about daddy being out of work, mommy&rsquo;s low earnings, and the kids&rsquo; embarrassing school situation.)</p>

			<p> So, Mr. Large, what are some of these things that White men can learn about working with blacks? Your column is mighty brief and rather hollow without any details. And why is it that you say Whites sometimes &#8220;view blacks&#8221; as a problem, while for blacks, Whites &#8220;are&#8221; their biggest problem? Apparently you think &#8220;perspective&#8221; only swings one way.</p>
<p> And since you seem to think that Chuck Shelton&rsquo;s spending time with black kids his own age when he was a child has made him, shall we say, more &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to black concerns, how come a more common result when Whites have to associate with blacks is a more negative view of the blacks on the part of the Whites?</p>

<i>&ldquo;How to Work Successfully with Black Colleagues and Customers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If I were to write my book titled, &#8220;How to Work Successfully with White Colleagues and Customers&#8221;, it wouldn&rsquo;t get published. Most of the stuff in it would be common sense and issues of dependability, reliability, and respect.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;ve actually done well working with blacks. The trick is to play ignorant and take everything they say as profound revelation. &#8220;No! Really? Go on. I never thought of it like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>They eat it up.</p>

			<p>We should stop being a problem for our black population.  We need not pollute them anymore with our welfare, affirmative action, and general all around pity and pandering.  You know, when those white teenagers are buying hip-hop releases (though it&rsquo;s not as much as it used to be), that&rsquo;s a real problem, we&rsquo;re really ruining them.  </p>

			<p>And all the brainwashed white apologists are crawling out of the woodwork!</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Black people resent being viewed as a &lsquo;problem&rsquo; when white people are often the main problem black folks have.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>If liberal white Americans learnt what the majority of blacks <i>really</i> think about them&hellip;</p>
<p><i>Black people tire of the expectation they should teach white people about race:</i></p>
<p>And we &#8220;tire&#8221; of being told that we whites, as a whole, are - and will always be - irredeemably &#8220;racist&#8221; at any-and-all interracial interactions.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;White people must learn how to accept responsibility for being white.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Translation: <i>Whites <b>must</b> feel guilty for the past bad actions of whites (who in most cases were&rsquo;nt even related to them), the fact that white societies are (were) highly successful, and that non-whites (except possibly Asians) are jealous of the success that whites enjoy</i>.</p>
<p><i>The book, which came out in January, talks about the advantages that go with being white and male,</i> </p>
<p>What &#8220;advantages&#8221;:<br>
The fact that most white males are <i>still</i> relatively successful in life (or even exist), in the face of Affirmative Action must really annoy this guilt-stricken white.</p>
<p><i>the tension between being honest and being respectful,</i></p>
<p>Translation: <i>Not <b>daring</b> to even consider the thought of reprimanding a black coworker/customer for reprimandable behabiour</i></p>
<p><i>the illusion of colorblindness.</i></p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s got that point down:<br>
&#8220;Colorblindness&#8221; is a lie perpetuated by white liberals to convince themselves that <i>race doesn&rsquo;t exist</i>, even in the face of black/Hispanic racial conciousness</p>

<p>I assume this book is his last chance to make some sort of career.  He should know however, that white diversity consultants<br>
pretty much have to be women.  Maybe he wants to be the next Tim Wise.</p>

			<p>Interesting book title, but what about folks like me, who are simply not remotely interested in working with black colleagues and customers?  Could Shelton write a companion volume titled &#8220;We Just Don&rsquo;t Care.  You Aren&rsquo;t Special.  Get Over It&#8221;?</p>

			<p>I live Seattle, and this author has views that are typical of liberal white Seattle residents. Mostly white Seattle has a black female head of the school district, has had a black mayor, and has black county executive on his way to DC to work for President B. Hussein Obama.  It is very fashionable today to be black in a big corporate job, but there are not enough smart blacks to fill those jobs.  The myth of white priviledge is frequently sold to anyone who will believe it. </p>

			<p>It sounds like Chuck Shelton has written a book on how to take advantage of and exploit Blacks.</p>
<p>But if you want to be a con artist, then you should learn from the best. I would highly recommend &#8220;Scam: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America&#8221; by  Jesse Lee Peterson <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scam-Black-Leadership-Exploits-America/dp/0785263314" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Scam-Black-Leadership-Exploits-America/dp/0785263314</a><br>

			<p>&ldquo;White people must learn how to accept responsibility for being white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assume that what he means by that is that Whites must take responsibility for being more intelligent and capable than Blacks by giving them their money in: tax money going to social services for Blacks and other non-Whites, giving Blacks their daughters and women, helping Blacks to get promoted beyond their capabilities, and just in general turning our society over to Blacks and other non-Whites and just otherwise committing racial suicide.  It&rsquo;s fairly obvious that Black&rsquo;s will never ever take any responsibility for not having White people&rsquo;s capabilities, and will never take responsibility for their own drug use, crime, out of wedlock births, and other niceties  of Black tribal life. </p>

			<p>Yes, we white people better start shaping up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so dumb and evil!  It just isn&rsquo;t right of us to spend every waking minute plotting against the pure and innocent black people.</p>
<p>We have so much we can learn from black people.  I say, from now on, in every way, all white people should struggle to raise themselves up to the level of the all-wise, all-intelligent, hard working, noble and good black folks.  What a wonderful world this would be if everyone behaved as they do!</p>
<p>And just think of all the wonderful scientific knowledge and technology we&rsquo;d have!</p>

			<p>The best way to turn the argument around on these &#8216;white privelege&rsquo; dolts is simply ask the person, &#8220;What obligates ME do do ANYTHING in the best interest of YOU? What, specifically, will YOU do for me that is in MY best interest at the expense of your own?&#8221;</p>
<p>You expose their passive aggressive manipulations to empower themselves at your expense and instead of the tolerant egalitarians they are shown up as typical totalitarian power mongers.</p>

			<p>The &#8216;white privelege&rsquo; logic also presupposed that American civilization &#8216;just happened&rsquo; and white people took it over.  </p>
<p>And they view America in isolation. Just point out that there are are numerous African nations for blacks only where there is no &#8216;white privelege&rsquo; to worry about and more than twenty Hispanic-only nations in Central and South America. Nobody is stuck in America and all of these countries are only a plane ride away.</p>

			<p>When the black preacher claimed that most of his people&rsquo;s problems were caused by whites did he conclude his remarks by declaring that therefore blacks should migrate to Haiti, Jamaica or Africa in order to be free of &#8220;white racism&#8221;?</p>
<p>Of course not; those places don&rsquo;t hand out enough welfare checks.</p>

<p>9,999/10,000 is a fraction. Also this sentence implies you might be surprised that executives are only a small percentage of the workforce. It is like saying emperors made up only a small percentage of the citizens of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>At least unqualified blacks don&rsquo;t seem to be underrepresented in liberal newspaper writing jobs.</p>

So if the CEO of a Fortune 500 company is white, but the woman who cleans his office bathroom is black, then the CEO should spend hours taking a class to learn how to flatter La&rsquo;Shaniqua the Toilet Scrubber?  Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll jump right on that fabulous opportunity.</p>

<p> Well of course we are the main problem they have. Every move<br>
we make and everything we do, they are obsessed if it&rsquo;s<br>
racist or not. It gets old and to the point where one no longer cares anymore. Because anything and everything Whites do<br>
is perceived as racist to them somehow.</p>
<p> blacks are always on the look out for White racism. And<br>
if they cannot find any, they make it up.</p>
<p>(Black people tire of the expectation they should teach white people about race)</p>
<p> Who exactly appointed them this &#8220;duty&#8221;. It sure wasn&rsquo;t<br>
the White race. So as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they can quit<br>
and resign from their self appointed &#8220;duty&#8221;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White people must learn how to accept responsibility for being white.&rdquo;</p>
<p> As usual, a damnation from them for being White. When<br>
might they bear some responsibility for being black ?</p>
<p> When might they stop blaming all of their failures on<br>
Whites and racism ? </p>

			<p>Holy Sominex Batman, they are SO Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>All of us have had at least one time in our life when we have bored someone, or someone has bored us - even if they or we happened to have a point about what we were talking about, a complaint for example.</p>
<p>But if it ever became a problem we were pulled back by that mechanism inside of us that helps us recognize that there is a limit.  Perhaps the limit isn&rsquo;t always clear, but it&rsquo;s there, and sooner or later that limit is reached.</p>
<p>What we are experiencing now is that with Black and other non-Whites, there IS no limit. And not just in regard to complaining.  This is what accounts for that strange feeling about the times we live in today.  Well, it&rsquo;s one of the things.  There&rsquo;s a lot more, and one could go on.  But I don&rsquo;t want to bore you.</p>

			<p>would someone please tell me what special privileges I have being white?<br>
I&rsquo;m raised by a single mother who was later disabled and we lived on welfare. Neither myself nor my siblings ever took any welfare after we were 18. <br>
I joined the military, got a GI Bill, went to school and worked quite a number jobs and some of them at the same time while being a full time student.<br>
I got my first job as the newbie.</p>
<p>What privileges do I have that no one else has?</p>
<p>I see Asians getting great scores, I see them saving money, but I never once complained that they have it any different than I do.</p>

<p>Correct and they figure that whites are better educated simply because they went to a better school. No learning, research, reading or studying involved. Whites would become better educated even if they went to the same school as blacks.</p>

			<p>Actually, he&rsquo;s spot on.  You know what we should do?  We should put the shoe on the other foot. Make white people sit in the back of the bus.  Make them drink from separate fountains. Use separate bathrooms, go to separate schools, live in separate areas.  See how <em>they</em> like it!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Black people resent being viewed as a &lsquo;problem&rsquo; when white people are often the main problem black folks have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made me reflect on the comment a black college professor made a number of years ago. He said something along the lines of, &ldquo;The world would be a better place if all the white people were exterminated.&rdquo; And then I thought about the black guy who said something like, &ldquo;If I knew I only had one hour left to live, I would like to spend it choking a white man.&rdquo; <br>

			<p>I will always opposed &#8216;diversity&rsquo; training aka re-education, as long as white culture isn&rsquo;t taught esp. to ALL immigrants who need to learn manners and transportation etiquette.</p>

			<p>I went to a black high school for four years and although I met some highly intelligent blacks and so really good law abiding blacks there was undoubtly a strong presence of ignorance. Alot of them would be into dancing, drinking, sex, basketball, football, fighting, and other proclivaties that don&rsquo;t help them progress.</p>
<p>Im not saying all, but a large portion of black community is irresponsebile and lazy. Sadly they are responsible for their own demise, just like in Africa, Haiti, and Jamaca. I remeber some of my black friends dropping out school because they got someone pregant or became pregnant. This is a sad truth that they bring all their problems on themselves.</p>
<p>If they did control their sexual habits and their violent habits, which account for 75% of all their problem, then their neighborhoods wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad and they wouldn&rsquo;t have the problems that they have.</p>

			<p>Good post, Awakened!</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>Let us take responsibility for being White and reclaim our heritage as &#8220;the Noble Ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>WE invented capitalism and economic prosperity, WE took Christianity from a cult and made it into a force, WE wrote the greatest literature, produced the greatest art,  WE conceptualized systems of philosophy and methods of scientific inquiry, WE have been, and are the greatest force of charity in the world &hellip; </p>
<p>It is time to reclaim the stern countenance of our ancestors, and deal accordingly with those who despise us.</p>

			<p>&#8220;White people must learn how to accept responsibility for being white.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This statement is so idiotic, it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
What he means, of course, is that whites should feel appropriately guilty for being white. And act upon this guilt. The same way whites should feel guilty for something called the weather now, or &#8216;Global Warming&rsquo;. The difference being Global Warming is a scientific fact.</p>
<p>It does have me wondering, since it&rsquo;s been colder than normal the last 10 years, and temperatures are projected to rise by as much as 5 degrees F by 2100, that means it&rsquo;s actually 10 degrees F below normal during our decade, taking all the other proven scientific facts into account. Surely the Earth is doomed. So, surely Mr. Shelton need not spend his time engendering whites with the proper sensitivity to blacks, going by the scientific facts.  </p>

<p>The government is forced to deal with the blacks, and thats only to keep them from rioting. </p>

I find your thinking excruciatingly convoluted and tendentious.<br>
Re &ldquo;White people must learn how to accept responsibility for being white.&rdquo;<br>
No one can be expected to have to &#8220;accept&#8221; anything about their genetic heritage.Such a statement is prime facie idiotic.<br>
Do you have to &#8220;accept responsibility&#8221; for example for Huntington&rsquo;s Disease if you were so unfortunate as to have received the gene for it, and it expressed itself ?<br>
The age of total genetic understanding is upon us, sir, and when the implications of genetic differences are worked out the social<br>
differences will be far better understood. <br>
Why don&rsquo;t you simply say it&hellip;you are a nihilist; you are uncomfortable with scientifically established truths. You want religion back, you&rsquo;re looking for a prophet, you want guidance, and you want others to have these needs, too.<br>
The age of religion has passed. </p>

<p>Well nobody is stopping blacks in America from returning to Africa anytime they feel like it. And nobody forced blacks to leave their &#8220;black world&#8221; in Jamaica, Somalia, etc, and come to White countries like Canada and Great Britain where they have to &#8220;interact&#8221; with Whites. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand you people.  You have this idea that it is possible to revert back to times where whites were dominant and people were conservative.  This will not happen because those with the power (the rockefellers and rothschilds) will not allow it.  They have their agenda and will impose it with impunity.  They own the feds and we all know the rule: he who OWNS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES.</p>

			<p>I think the author has failed to mention successful Black CEO&rsquo;s such as Franklin Raines, CEO of Freddie Mac</p>
<p>BIO<br>
Following his tenure in Democrat Bill Clinton&rsquo;s White House as Budget Director, Raines returned to Fannie Mae where he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer prior to being forced out over accounting fraud allegations that federal authorities claimed were used to pad his own pocket with tens of millions of dollars in un-earned bonuses on top of his multi-million dollar pay. Raines and other top executives drew multi-million dollar salaries at Fannie Mae for many years.</p>
<p>Although he claimed no wrong doing, Raines agreed to settle the suit with the federal government just this year and agreed to pay back a few million of the near $50 million it had been alleged he obtained illegally through bonuses not due from Fannie Mae.</p>

<p>There were, of course, a large number of Blacks in there.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m betting that white men can learn to overthrow the aracial silliness that may lead to the destruction of all whites, male and female.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting that all whites can be deprogrammed from the absurd &#8220;diversity is swell&#8221; nonsense of this age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting that whites can learn that we have among us certain whites who have genetic defects that make them want to die off and take all other whites with them.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t say that, before you know it there will be a class action lawsuit by ghetto gangsters with no knowledge of software engineering against Microsoft.  The court will demand that 15% of their workforce consist of blacks acting as office furniture sitting around all day talking to their honeys on the phone.   </p>
