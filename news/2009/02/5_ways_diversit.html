			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Frankel, DiversityInc Magazine, February 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} This is about how diversity (which means including and realizing the potential of everyone) can save your job by making you more valuable to your organization. If you are a white man, this applies to you as well. As a manager or as an employee, your willingness to appreciate innovation and talent, and your ability to relate to customers, will make you the one who survives these tough times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s [the advice of 17 chief diversity officers] on making sure your commitment to diversity makes you indispensable to your company:</p>
<p>No. 1: Don&rsquo;t be negative. Emphasize how downturns can be critical times to recruit talent.</p>
<p>Just like recessions can offer other bargains, the ability to snap up great people, especially those in demand, is an opportunity you should push at your company.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if your company is laying people off, some new positions will need to be filled. Keep your &#8220;eye on the ball to attract the best talent  &mdash;  and they are diverse,&#8221; advises Subha Barry, managing director, head of global diversity and inclusion at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. {snip}</p>
<p>And Rohini Anand, senior vice president and global chief diversity officer at Sodexo {snip} urges people to get their companies branded as diversity leaders by partnering with grassroots organizations and gaining DiversityInc Top 50 recognition because that&rsquo;s an essential way to find and reach talent.</p>
<p>No. 2: Don&rsquo;t let your panic over the economy get in the way of being truly innovative and creative.</p>
<p>At times like this, diverse perspectives  &mdash;  and solutions  &mdash;  are all the more valued. &#8220;We&rsquo;re looking for innovators. The key is that you&rsquo;ve got to have those diverse perspectives to drive the innovation,&#8221; says Robert Crumpton, director of diversity at Monsanto Co. {snip}</p>
<p>No. 3: If you are in a management position, make sure your best and brightest aren&rsquo;t the ones leaving and that they know the diversity commitment is long-term.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we want to hold on to our very best talent, this is the very time at which they are being pushed by the competition and are likely to make life decisions about whether the stress is worth staying on in the industry or not,&#8221; says Barry, whose industry certainly hasn&rsquo;t been a stable one. &#8220;The ability for us to create the right environment, especially for our diverse talent, easily spills over to the broader population. This is an indication that efforts in the diversity space have a much broader ripple effect within the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you work for a progressive company with a long history as a diversity leader, make sure your key people understand that no matter what happens, diversity remains a core value and business driver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No. 4: Use diversity to make new connections to your customers.</p>
<p>The demographics of this country are changing dramatically, with white people projected to be the minority by 2042. Even beyond that, people  &mdash;  especially younger people  &mdash;  want a work force that is inclusive of everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, orientation or disability. By relating to the evolving marketplace and devising new customer strategies, you can make yourself invaluable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Customization has never been greater, so our customers do not want one-size-fits-all approaches. Diversity becomes increasingly important to understand a whole different set of norms, lifestyles and needs,&#8221; [says Magda Yrizarry, vice president of workplace culture, diversity and compliance in corporate human resources at Verizon Communications, No. 1 in the DiversityInc Top 50.]</p>
<p><br>
This goes for business-to-business companies as well. &#8220;Increasingly, clients are talking and asking for both supplier diversity and work-force diversity, and not about what your policies are and what you&rsquo;re doing, but about diverse teams  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s not just that they want a diverse team, they want the best teams at the end of the day, and the best teams are diverse, especially in a global environment,&#8221; says Allan Mark, America&rsquo;s director, diversity strategy and involvement at Ernst &amp; Young {snip}.</p>
<p>No. 5: Join  &mdash;  and lead  &mdash;  an employee-resource group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola Co., No. 2 in the DiversityInc Top 50, now asks its employee-resource groups to put together an annual business plan, which the group members present personally to the president of North American operations every year. Steve Bucherati, chief diversity officer at Coca-Cola, tells us how the Latino employee-resource group helped launch an energy drink aimed primarily at Latinos by asking them to help position the product.</p>

			<p>2. The Coca-Cola Company<br>
There is a line in &#8220;The Magnificent Seven&#8221; that describes my personal boycott efforts. &#8220;You`ve got to fight and  keep on fighting until the reason for it is gone&#8221;. Translation, This is gonna go on so long you`ll forget why you started in the first place. Pretty much describes my boy cott of Coke. Guess it`s been over four years now&hellip; 69cents X 2 X 365 X 4= 2800.00 or so. Started back on some Rebel flag issue, now I just like the taste or RC better.<br>
  Now to my newspaper. Started to say four months but it`s been more like six. Every two months I buy one when I wait for my girl at the Doctor`s office. Still got the same old buzzwords, the same old spin and the same old agenda.  I like to think of reading it once every two months as  some sort of an innoculation. So in conclusion, 50 cents x 180.00= 90.00 Funny,  it feels so good to stop being poisoned until now I never thought about the extra ninety dollars.</p>

			<p>If all these minorities were creating innovation and prosperity, then companies would not have to be forced to hire these people.  Didn&rsquo;t these minorities complain that the tests you have to pass before you get hired was racist because they always failed those simple tests. </p>

			<p>And how many of these companies are on hard times because they&rsquo;re spending so much money to chase around the diversity unicorn?</p>
<p>#3   &mdash;   what I think they mean by that is that a black or Hispanic who can show up on time every day, well groomed and can string three words together in a coherent fashion will be very much in desire.  They&rsquo;re telling us to pay them more because they&rsquo;re going to get more from someone else if you don&rsquo;t, after all your company just can&rsquo;t do without their one half-witted insight per decade.</p>

			<p>&#8220;5 Ways Diverstiy Can Lose Your Job&#8221;</p>
<p>1)Minorities(protected classes) can gang up on you and call you racist.<br>
2)Discipling a minority(protected class)for almost anything, can get you fired.<br>
3)Blowing your top at someone in a protected class because of something they have done that is really bad, can get you fired.<br>
4)Having a simple disagreement with a protected class, might turn into racism charges against you and get you fired.<br>
5)A simple misunderstanding of any kind, with a protected class could get you fired.</p>
<p>Certainly there are an almost infinite amount of reasons a person who is not in a protected class might get fired. We need not restrict ourselves to a mere 5.</p>

			<p>I would like to know Diversity Inc.&rsquo;s bottom of the list diversity performers so that I can direct what litle business I have to direct towards them. </p>
<p>The Diversity Inc. web page is just loaded with gems, but in the five minutes I perused their homepage, (my limit of TOLERANCE for such sites and journalism) I failed to find a link to the low performers. Maybe some Amren posters can help with this.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Here&rsquo;s [the advice of 17 chief diversity officers] on making sure your commitment to diversity makes you indispensable to your company&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Two quick points:</p>
<p>1.) Whites taking the employment advice of a &#8220;chief diversity officer,&#8221; is like a suicidal individual obtaining crisis counseling from a king of the serial killers. Nothing good is going to come from it!</p>
<p>2.) Now we have &#8220;chief diversity officers?&#8221; What happened to the &#8220;good old days,&#8221; when organizations only had one &#8220;diversity officer&#8221; on the boat? With that in mind, why didn&rsquo;t the Titanic crash into a &#8220;chief iceberg&#8221; and then a few of its ice cube underlings?</p>
<p>Enjoy:</p>

			<p>It must be the job of &#8220;Diversity Officers&#8221; to blow hot air and  excess verbiage in order to confuse, befuddle and obfuscate to a point where anybody who has the slightest interest quickly loses it  &mdash;  just like the above article. For the life of me I can&rsquo;t figure out what they do or what it&rsquo;s for, but most of them get paid obscene salaries. The &#8220;Head of Diversity&#8221; for the last university I worked for got paid 275k a year, and I&rsquo;ll bet no one could figure out what the guy did besides hand out an occasional press release gushing about the virtues of multiculturalism. If you&rsquo;re really good at it, you can become like Cornel West or Michael Dyson and let your imagination run riot in confused,non-sensical, psuedo-intellectual grandstanding. It takes a lot of work to become a diversity officer or a black intellectual. </p>

			<p>If, as the article says (#4), people want diversity in the workplace, why don&rsquo;t they want diversity in their neighborhoods?  The Attorney General says much the same thing.  Why would anyone want to work with people they don&rsquo;t care to spend their free time with?  The answer is, most people don&rsquo;t want diversity, but they know better than to say so.  The State and its media allies (masters?) have manufactured so many lies that they have introduced near-dementia into the population.  Everyone lies to everyone else, fearful of being out of step.  These diversity mongers are riding a tiger, and they don&rsquo;t dare stop riding and lying.  They must stamp out every dissenting voice, for fear that a voice of honesty and reason might catch the ears of the Whites who bear all the burden of multicultural fantasies.  </p>

			<p>I was shocked to see Verizon Communications at the top of this list.  I work in the human rights field in NYC and I can assure you that Verizon is charged with discrimination almost daily.  And they often lose because they refuse to cooperate with any kind of investigation.  Rest assured Amrenners-they lose the cases while any defendent who puts up any kind of defense whatsoever manages to have their case dismissed.</p>

			<p>Has anyone ever noticed that once a Diversity gains hiring authority, the workforce quickly becomes Mono-Diverse.  Of course as long as there are no Whites this is not only acceptable, but even desirable.</p>

			<p>I agree with Diversity magazine. Surprised? I guess you should be, if you have read my comments at AmRen, but these diversity professionals are absolutely correct that diversity can help you keep your job. Diverse companies have to overhire in order to compensate for the ineptitude of the under-qualified minorites they hire from great colleges like Thurgood Marshall University, and Spellman College (where Denise Huxtable went to school). The more diverse a corporation, the better the chance that they need someone to do the mathematics, show up to meetings, and not steal the company funds. Yes we Whites can!</p>

			<p>What a pack of lies! &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is a benfit to a company the way Cancer is a benefit to the human body. </p>
<p>Of all the myriad lies surrounding the greater egalitarian/race flim-flam, this idea that &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is a strength has to be the most onerous and patently false of them all.(see most recent AR cover story for more details!)  </p>

			<p>So are we a &#8220;diverse society&#8221; or a &#8220;melting pot society?&#8221;  We can&rsquo;t be both as they are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Well, as if I need to explain it to Amren posters, this is for the other visitors.  When Blacks and other minorities want jobs and political power, it is about multiculturalism and the rap is aimed at White ears - at least no one else seems to be listening.  But when Black in particular want more intimate inroads into White society as if working to infiltrate the Whites - as apparently announced last week - in our own homes on weekends, then we are supposed to switch to the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; model for those purposes.  Just one of the hundreds of things wrong with forcing social change on people unnaturally.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;..but it&rsquo;s not just that they want a diverse team, they want the best teams at the end of the day, and the best teams are diverse, especially in a global environment,&rdquo; says Allan Mark, America&rsquo;s director, diversity strategy and involvement at Ernst &amp; Young {snip}.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say it twice every day, and three times on Sunday.  And don&rsquo;t forget to click your heels when you do.  It might just come true.</p>
<p>Drivel like this article is proof that &#8220;diversity&#8221; is nothing but an incantation - a magic word.  One could just as well have substituted the word &#8220;canteloupe&#8221; and &#8220;canteloupy&#8221; in place of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;diverse&#8221; in the above article and it would have been everybit as insightful.</p>

			<p>Notice how all of these best companies are giant companies. The have the resouces to throw money away on useless diverse employees. Just keep them busy on some makework &#8216;restructuring&rsquo; project and then when the project is almost complete several months or years later change the plans and have them start over. Giant companies also support lots of white sandbaggers who don&rsquo;t do much more than sit in a cubible all day and enter data into spreadsheets that nobody will ever look at again. Giant companies are just a replacement for state welfare. </p>

			<p>My own experience is that in any sufficiently &#8220;diverse&#8221; workplace, the focus becomes not &#8220;offending&#8221; anyone (read &#8221; avoiding giving nonwhites the excuse to pretend to be offended&#8221;) rather than on actually producing good work.  Every time I read an article like this, full of the usual newspeak buzzwords, I am happy all over again that I am self-employed.</p>

			<p>Wow - I&rsquo;m speechless!<br>
Then I had a brief look at &#8216;DiversityInc&rsquo;&hellip;just the headings were enough, I&rsquo;m not signing in and unwittingly showing my solidarity with such (not funny) clowns.</p>
<p>There was a poster at the notice board at my workplace entitled &#8216;Racism: It&rsquo;s Always Unacceptable&rsquo;, with an email address diversity@companyname.<br>
Anyway, I work at a place which is overwhelmingly white and male. A few women and a handful of Indians, and yes, no problems whatsoever at us all doing our jobs.<br>
This poster depicted a harrassed looking young Asian woman eating her bowl of rice (with chopsticks, and worth noting was that she had a lot of make-up on and was good-looking), behind her was a red-faced male yobbo with a maniacial and ugly look on his face making his eyes look slanted and to his right was another red-faced female with her face contorted in an ugly version of hilarity.<br>
This poster would have cost a fortune to make up and distribute Australia-wide (I&rsquo;m talking about a national company here) and tells the majority of its workers that you&rsquo;re a bunch of unsavoury drunken racist ba*%^%ds! </p>
