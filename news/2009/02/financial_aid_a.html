<h1>Students Protest Former Rep. Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s Speech at American U.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marissa Lang, The Diamondback (University of Maryland), February 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 400 students from universities across the Washington metropolitan area converged at American University Tuesday night in a peaceful protest, waving signs festooned with a simple message written and occasionally shouted in more than five different languages: &#8220;America is multicultural.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students from this university, American, George Washington and Georgetown sat in forced silence at American University last night, as American University police officers encircled the room, to oppose former Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s (R) stand against immigration and America&rsquo;s &#8220;cult of diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The trip was organized by the Latino Student Union&rsquo;s advocacy committee, though other students attended. They said they heard about the protest via an announcement sent out by the D.C. Latino Student Partnership, an umbrella organization that organizes and increases communication between Latino groups in the area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tancredo was invited to speak at American University by the newly established national organization Youth for Western Civilization  &mdash;  a national right-wing organization that aims to reverse policies perceived as being anti-American  &mdash;  which YWC President Kevin DeAnna said will likely attempt to establish a chapter at this university in the near future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to announce ourselves as a force,&#8221; DeAnna said. &#8220;[The turnout] shows that people have been waiting for this kind of a message: that people of the West should get off of their knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Tancredo denied being prejudiced against any group, students characterized much of the former congressman&rsquo;s ideologies as being &#8220;ignorant&#8221; and &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tancredo, who ran for president in 2008, dubbed immigrants&rsquo; tendencies to hold on to their own cultures as a destructive force in the &#8220;American fabric&#8221; that he said needs to change to preserve the union.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout history, people who are not white Anglo-Saxon have become American by adopting a white Anglo-Saxon culture,&#8221; Tancredo said. &#8220;Today, this cult of multiculturality emphasizes our differences  &mdash;  things that pull us apart instead of bringing us together.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tancredo&rsquo;s speech singled out both Latinos and Muslims as &#8220;problem&#8221; cultures that are contributing to the fragmentation of American society.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are forcing children to participate in a world that promotes Muslim sensitivities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are losing the relevance of citizenship. Being an American used to mean something. We have every right to be proud of who we are. And this is not something I think we can survive.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Interesting that Double-T would cite both Mexico and Islam as problem cultures, because they sometimes covertly participate.  After 9/11, we found that some of the radical Islamic terrorists got Mexican help to sneak across the border, as the latter can easily pass for the former in a group of them together.</p>
<p>Also, there was a short-lived news mag on the regular Fox over the air network, called &#8220;The Pulse&#8221; and hosted by Bill O&rsquo;Reilly at the Fox Cable News Channel.  It debuted not longer after 9/11, and their very first segment was done by the great lib Geraldo Rivera, and my mouth dropped to the floor when he exposed these Mexico-Islam links.</p>
<p>I asked someone I knew at the time that we know how these Islamic ne&rsquo;er-do-wells got into the U.S. from Mexico, they hid with Hispanics and snuck across   &mdash;   but how did they get into Mexico?  A country, mind you, that is mostly militarized at its own southern border, and has nativism hard-wired into its Constitution.  My theory was that the Mexican government secretly and knowingly let them in, as Mexico was covertly sponsoring terrorist attacks against the U.S. like 9/11.  However, Mexico isn&rsquo;t exactly world-renowned for being a nation of laws, the right amount of money in the right hands can make anything happen or go away.</p>

			<p>Speak up Tancredo.  If you speak up about cultural and racial differences the media will report it constantly thinking they were ruining any support you might get.  Instead, it would wake up America to the fact that we are committing suicide.  </p>

			<p>In San Francisco yesterday, a croud of hundreds of illegals and their sympathizers gathered in a school auditorium to complain about ICE raids taking away illegals. They insist that they have a god given right to live anywhere they want, and break any of our laws anytime.A City Official, the Assesor said that he doesnt want taxpayer dollars to send illegals home.He doesnt seem to object to billions  of tax payer dollars paying to educate and hospitalize millions of illegals in our state, which now running a deficit of $40 billion.If Mayor Newsom becomes our next governor, I fear that he will make California a sanctuary state,given his love for them.Sane people are a very small minority in San Francisco</p>

			<p>It is unfortunate but young people today have been indoctrinated in the public school system and in higher education.  They are not taught to think but instead they parrot the party line (whatever their professor or MTV tells them).  Hopefully they will get a taste of &#8220;diversity&#8221; without losing their life and wake up.  </p>

			<p>Sat in forced silence?  In other words they were expected to behave like a typical audience. </p>
<p>Latino Student Union&rsquo;s advocacy committee is calling Tancredo racist?  In other words, an advocacy group that is built on racial membership is calling the congressman racist.</p>

			<p>I was present, and this is a foolish and inaccurate report. Rep. Tancredo emphasized that he was not against immigration as such, but only against mass immigration without assimilation. No one &#8220;forced&#8221; the students to be silent, of course, but occasional interruptions from the audience were several times met by audible &#8220;shushing&#8221; from other students who wished to hear what the Congressman had to say. It is shameful that so many guards had to be on hand to ensure the Congressman&rsquo;s safety. It is also shameful to hear students, some of whom are no older than eighteen, presuming to call a sixty-three year old five-time US Congressmen &#8220;ignorant.&#8221; <br>
I must admit that one thing had me fooled: I kept looking around for the protesters until it suddenly dawned on me that the audience WAS the protest.<br>
The student newspaper of American University itself, by the way, produced a much better report on the event:<br>

			<p>Here is what these young hispanic and muslim &#8216;Americans&#8221; are really saying:racial politics for our people. White Americans, we will not allow you to engage in racial indentity politics.</p>
<p>When we confront non-white protesters in public, we must go to the heart of the issue from the get go. Publicly identify that these hispanic and muslim protesters are doing. That is to say, expose the double standard and then state that White Americans will from here on out will engage in race based politics.Then state  a majority of Native Born Whie Americans oppose post-1965 immigration policy because it will reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America. And&hellip;state that the young hispanic and muslim protesters are aware of this and think its a good policy.And follow up with:Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of being reduced to a racial minority within the borders of America?  </p>
<p>WE must frame the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;. Tancredo could have done this. But he didn&rsquo;t. He obviously has no idea what he is up againast.</p>

			<p>In our own country with our God given heritage we are being forced to fight for already granted rights from immigrants and oversexed youths indoctrinated by multicult faculties funded by governments.  This is truly abomination.  God bless TT for courage to speak for our culture.  The US is one nation of core beliefs derived from one culture.  We have been too tolerant and too welcoming to what appears to be offensive enemies who do not offer US any respect.   The racial/ethnics who come to offend our heritage need to be ashamed (they have none) and embarrassed.  Those who would deny US of its heritage are not here to become Americans.  They are here to destroy and take what US has built.<br>
Americans have had enough already and we are going to fight back.<br>
Foreign interests using pressure groups funded by foreigners and money laundry will have the light shined upon them. Build the fence, fill the buses and ready the ships for deportation to all the phoney foreign speaking posers devoid of any tolerance and lacking any respect. They do not represent American values. They came to continue destruction of US Constitution and take away our freedoms.  We need to demonstrate their phony ignaorance of US. Those who came to offend TT and real Americans reveal their UN American ways by their behavior. They want US to be under internaional system.<br>
Multicultism is yesterday!  All evidence points to devisive destruction of races/ethnics.  No country should be robbed of its identity to please foreigners. These posers want US to give up our culture for theirs.  NO WAY!    V</p>

			<p>I challenge any average American to distinguish a swarthy Mexican from a swarthy Arab or Pakistani. Saddam Hussein standing on any street in Juarez or Tijuana or crossing the border in a crowd of illegal could blend right in unless you heard him speak.</p>

			<p>This video by the Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders challenges the desire of Muslims to silence freedom of speech. In Europe there are now over 20 million Arabs / Muslims and the number is climbing as politicians continue import them to support the aging populations and also to ensure they have a strong voting base in the coming years. </p>
<p>This is his movie Fitna - https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3369102968312745410</p>
<p>Before it&rsquo;s too late begin pressuring your congressmen or get into politics yourself and take immigration seriously or the European cultures stand to be eliminated, followed quickly by America.</p>
<p>The video at the bottom of this paragraph, Submission, is what got Theo Van Gogh murdered – descendent of Vincent Van Gogh (https://www.vangoghgallery.com). It depicts Muslim women suffering from domestic abuse, with passages from the Koran that support abusing women. Van Gogh, an artist, was shot several times on his way to work by Mohammed Bouyeri. However he did not die instantly, he begged for his life before being nearly decapitated and having a note posted to his chest with a knife. The contents of the note: <a href="https://www.militantislammonitor.org/article/id/312" rel="nofollow">https://www.militantislammonitor.org/article/id/312</a></p>
<p>Americans and Europeans will have to give up our culture unless we wake up to this threat.</p>

			<p>TT is not a very savvy or forceful orator.  We need Theodore Roosevelt in there.  He felt that when you came to America, you needed to assimilate and BE an American!   I feel the same way.  You learn the language and respect the Constitution and laws.  What you do when you are in the privacy of your own home, speak whatever language, eat whatever foods, religion, is your OWN business.  You are an American first, an American of whatever ethnic origin.  What really aggravates me is the &#8220;African Americans&#8221;,.. they are BLACK first, always reminding us that they are the &#8220;chosen&#8221; with special privileges.  </p>

			<p>Multicuturalism means driving out Native Born White Americans out of large areas of American territory street by street,town by town,city by city, state by state and creating homogenous asian areas,homogenous muslim areas and homogenous hispanic areas. Miami is spanish speaking and foreign. LA is spanish speaking and foreign. Tancredo could have stated this obvious fact.</p>
<p>Tancredo is a fool. He is confronted by hispanic and muslim protesters with an in-your-face racial politics. And he responds with pathetic bleats about assimilation. TOM, THEY ARE WAGING A RACE WAR AGIANST OUR PEOPLE!!!</p>
<p>Here is what Tom Tancredo should have said &#8220;Here is a quote from Mario Obledo&#8221;the last gasp of White Amreica&#8221; In fact, he could have come up with at least twenty quotes from well nown hispanic racialist that indicates very strongly that hispanics are waging a race war against Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>What would Roy Beck say to these  young hispanic and muslim racialists? Somthing like this&hellip;Roy Beck:&#8221;Immigration has to be lowered because young hispanic Americans and young muslim Americans will be harmed by hispanic and muslim immigration.&#8221; Why does anyone send their $$$$$ to numbersusa.com. It seems that Peter Brimelow is as disgusted as I am with Roy Beck and numbersusa.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the headline and the article strive to obscure the fact that the &#8216;protest&rsquo; was little more than a group of hispanics objecting to the fact that WE are still allowed to object to THEM.  They, and whoever it is masterminding the destruction of America, are trying to stifle what little is left of our freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Scots-Irish &#8216;redneck&rsquo;.  I stumbled, one day, upon the story of the Highland Clearances.  Many, if not most, of my ancestors arrived in America, more or less involuntarily, because of the clearances.  Many were outright slaves.  I&rsquo;m descended from the few who were not worked to death in the fields.</p>
<p>Anyway, what&rsquo;s relevant here is the fact that in &#8216;Great&rsquo; Britain  it was forbidden to write about the Clearances.  It was a criminal act to write about the truth.  One could not even discuss what was going on.  And as soon as our right to write and speak freely here in America is supressed&hellip;.all the horrible things we all fear and know will happen, WILL HAPPEN.</p>
<p>Folks, if we lose this fight, it&rsquo;s all over.  Forever.</p>

			<p>Your typical Arab isn&rsquo;t going to pass as Mexican (eagle-beak nose and hairiness being only two of the many factors here).  A Muslim posing as Mexican should come from Turkey, northern Afghanistan, Iran, some Iraqi areas/groups, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, or (best of all) Indonesia.  </p>
<p>Though, many Mexicans do have Arab blood and may even have some Arab features (if not swamped by indigenous genes):  Spain was kicking out its Arabs during early colonization days.  One of my profs was from South America, was Spanish surnamed, and looked thoroughly Arab. <br>

			<p>The battle was lost long ago. If our less indoctrinated forefathers of the 40&rsquo;s, 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t enmass to hold congress accountable, what realistic chance do we have now? Our children have been so brain washed and the natural white strength/weakness of caring for your fellow man will forever enslave us to prioritize other races first.</p>
<p>Damage control is our only hope. </p>

			<p>Here in Canada, Islamists have been infiltrating campus student groups and forming alliances with anti-Western leftists.</p>
<p>They protest any use of Western military force, complain about rights, champion their pro-Middle Eastern causes, attack the U.S., and attempt to extort money by using white guilt.  </p>
<p>They have the stupid leftists wrapped around their fingers. </p>

<p>They look similar to each other, don&rsquo;t they. And they act similar, too. Just look at their corrupt, dysfunctional countries. Just look how little respect do they have for the laws and borders. Just look at the overpopulation, destruction, and crime that they bring with them whrerver they go.</p>
<p>God was very graceful to us that He made them look that way, so that we can recognize them right away in a crowd of well-meaning people. We just need to flatly reject the absurd calls against &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and such. We have eyes and brains in order to learn from experience what kind of people are wrecking our country.</p>

			<p>Frankly, I would rather see us as a REAL multi-cultural nation than an integrated &#8220;melting pot&#8221; variety.  The proponents of multi-culturalism only want to use this idea when it means gaining them special privileges and perks as &#8220;minorities&#8221; since there is so much to be gained.  Once that basket of neediness due to White oppression is filled, then they want to switch to the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; model of what it means to be an American so that they can take jobs, get undeserved seats at top universities, and infiltrate our families through the contact that these multiculturally driven privileges forced on Whites.</p>
<p>Well, make up your mind, are we Multi-cultural and ought we to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; that, or work to dismantle all vestiges of ethnicity, race and culture for the &#8220;good of America?,&#8221; via the oft mis-stated idea of the &#8220;melting pot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the result of a blending of all the races and cultures now present within the US borders would be hideous at the least, destructive to the national survival at the most.  That is because if the government or whatever force is in charge of this gets rid of cultural and ethnic realities, no culture is left but the one foisted on us by commerical culture a la Coca-Cola.  That is what is wrong now; most Whites only have a superficial notion of White cultures - they have forgotten who they were and so are easy prey for any other cultural influence.  That is why so many White celebrities look for meaning by going to Africa and seeking redemption by adopting a Black child or throwing some coins around.  Whites need to remember White classical literature, music and history.  And Christianity is counter productive to these ends.  That is my ferverent opinion.</p>

			<p>Tancredo was and is a great guy - on our side, not and idiot or a coward and he had/has the common touch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he fell into the trap most of our populist leaders do, he led his enablers push him in to a long shot, no shot run for the Presidency as the last hope to &#8220;SAVE AMERICA&#8221; - these always fail and the failed Presidential campaign usually means the end of the populist political leaders political career.</p>
<p>Tancredo should have kept his Congressional seat or ran for Governor of Colorado where he was well known and well liked - he might have won the powerful office of Governor. We need to WIN powerful offices and stop wasting all our time and money on failed, long shot, now shot Presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>Tancredo should be the governor of Colorado, Buchanan the Governor of New Hampshire, some pro White Southern populists should be governor of all the Southern States and then we consolidate our power at the state and local levels and challenge for national power.</p>
<p>Please, please, let&rsquo;s not have enablers ruin another promising pro White, pro Western civilization candidate&rsquo;s career by running and losing the Presidential campaign. The Presidential campaign is a horse race than is mostly fixed against us. That&rsquo;s reality. Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

			<p><i>Though Tancredo denied being prejudiced against any group, students characterized much of the former congressman&rsquo;s ideologies as being &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; and &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Oh, well, if <i>students</i> said it, it must be true, right?</p>
<p>F. Roger Devlin, you nailed it. I never could understand why so much of the print and TV media place so much wait on what &#8220;the students&#8221; have to say about, well, anything at all. Like you said, they&rsquo;re eighteen or twenty years old, give or take. For all practical purposes, they&rsquo;re children. They have little or no real world experience, and the very fact that they <i>are</i> students means they don&rsquo;t know a whole lot. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re students, they&rsquo;re learning.</p>

			<p>If Mexican culture which is based partially on Western culture is incompatible with America then so is every other nonwhite culture in the world whether it&rsquo;s the orientals, hindus or any other third world culture.  Tancredo is dead wrong on the issue.  Assimilation equals miscegenation.  Well, I suppose you can&rsquo;t go in front of a group of Hispanic militants and tell them you want them deported.  We&rsquo;re about 15 years too late for that anyhow.  Our only option is to partition the country into a White homeland and let the Mexicans, Asians and blacks fight over the remaining territory.</p>

			<p>Mexico and Mexicans in general are so hypocritical it&rsquo;s not funny.<br>
They guard their borders with military troops and have constitutional laws that make even naturalized citizens very 2ond class citizens, but they expect we give them everything their own country would not dream of giving even legal immigrants. </p>

			<p>     Students ? I remember that we had a so-called student protest at my campus during the &#8216;60&rsquo;s. Most of the demonstrators were paid bums hired off the street to augment the small numbers of real college protestors. They were given a few dollars or some Sneaky Pete for their troubles. After the demonstration most of them probably went back to their dumpsters and tied one on.</p>

<p>My theory?  A professor put them up to it.  When thousands of young men invade a foreign city, there is an old man with five stars on his helmet behind it all.  When masses of young people engage in some political theater, there&rsquo;s a professor behind it.  Politics are old people&rsquo;s games, young people do it in mass to impress a leftist prof.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Please, please, let&rsquo;s not have enablers ruin another promising pro White, pro Western civilization candidate&rsquo;s career by running and losing the Presidential campaign. The Presidential campaign is a horse race than is mostly fixed against us. That&rsquo;s reality. Let&rsquo;s move on.&#8221;<br>

Whatever are you trying to say here? Move on to what? Why can&rsquo;t you be clear and just come out and say it?</p>

			<p>hello moron students and fellow travelers: yes, America is to some extent multicultural. Immigration insures that various cultures exist here. Duh. </p>
<p>But Tancredo and others who support our nation&rsquo;s right to determine who immigrates here are not trying to get anyone fired simply because they are from a particular country or adhere to a particular culture. </p>
<p>Multiculturism, whatever it means, does not mean that anyone in the world can stay in America without proper documents, that illegal aliens can expect government funded health care, housing, welfare and education.</p>
<p>I suggest the demonstrators try to emigrate to the Peoples Republic of China and repeat their nonesensical argument. </p>
<p>I have no doubt that if we have a hispanic majority, that immigrants from Europe, Russia or Australia will not be welcome. We know what cultures multiculturalism means.</p>
