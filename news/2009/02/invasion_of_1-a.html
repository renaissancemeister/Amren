			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Groves, Daily Express (London), February 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE spectre of £1-an-hour foreign workers is coming to haunt recession-hit Britain.</p>
<p>That is the amount thousands of migrants queueing up to enter the country illegally are prepared to work for rather than having to return home.</p>
<p>Migrants living in camps at France&rsquo;s Channel ports told the Sunday Express they were determined to get to Britain and would not be dissuaded, however low the wages.</p>
<p>The revelation comes as the European Commission launches a new agency which could see thousands of asylum seekers from Africa transferred directly to the UK.</p>
<p>Brussels wants Britain to &#8220;share the burden&#8221; of dealing with 70,000 asylum seekers who cross the Mediterranean from Africa each year to countries such as Italy and Malta.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Jacqui Smith will today announce plans to &#8220;raise the bar&#8221; for foreign workers seeking permits in a bid to quell a public backlash over the impact of immigration during the recession. But critics last night said the developments made a mockery of Labour&rsquo;s claims to be getting to grips with immigration and asylum.</p>
<p>Last year the number of work permits handed out hit an all-time high of 151,000. Foreign workers now hold 3.8 million jobs in Britain, equivalent to 13 per cent of the total and almost double the number a decade ago.</p>
<p>In France, vast crowds living in makeshift camps in Channel ports made clear their determination to get to Britain. Many are seeking work in the black economy, where wages as low as £2 an hour are already undercutting British workers on the national minimum wage of £5.73.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget £2  &mdash;  most of us would certainly work for a £1 an hour. We&rsquo;d work for anything,&#8221; said Khalid, a 24-year-old from Iraq.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that Britain offers free accommodation and food, but we also want to work. We are certain we&rsquo;ll get to Britain. It&rsquo;s easy. All we have to do after that is start earning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalid, who would not reveal his surname, was with a group of friends living in a tent on wasteland opposite the port of Le Havre.</p>
<p>Each night they play a game of cat-and-mouse with police and security guards as they try to smuggle themselves on to ferries to Portsmouth.</p>
<p>If they fail, they simply wait for their next chance. The scene is replicated in up to half-a-dozen ports, with 2,000 migrants sleeping rough in the Calais region alone. Another migrant calling himself Iqbar and claiming he was 19 and from Iraq said: &#8220;We just want to get started. We have great respect for the English, but believe that in the end it is the people who are prepared to work the hardest who should get the jobs. If the British can&rsquo;t compete with £1 an hour then that&rsquo;s their problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few of the dozens of migrants spoken to by the Sunday Express have passports. While many will claim asylum when they get to Britain, others will simply disappear into the black economy.</p>
<p>All said £1-an-hour rates would not put them off working, as long as they could stay in Britain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve all suffered persecution, so a low-paid job doesn&rsquo;t bother us,&#8221; said Omhar, who said he was a 20-year-old Iranian. &#8220;Once we are established we will bring our families over. We know everybody is welcome and it&rsquo;s easy to get over if you keep trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European Commission has drawn up plans to create a European Asylum Support Office to &#8220;harmonise&#8221; asylum laws across the EU. Home Affairs Commissioner Jacques Barrot said the agency, to be set up next year, would also arrange &#8220;intra-community transfers&#8221;, shifting asylum seekers from hotspots like Italy to countries like the UK.</p>
<p>Shadow Immigration Minister Damian Green said it was wrong for Brussels to dictate how many asylum seekers we should take.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that the Government keep control over who we let in as refugees. This is a matter that must stay under the control of our Government and not be decided in Brussels.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the UK Border Agency insisted Britain would not agree to any EU proposals that would weaken our asylum controls.<br>

The question we need answered is how can people working for 3rd world wages afford to live in 1st world nations?</p>
<p>The answer is that they get a great deal of supplemental money and aid in forms of welfare, housing vouchers, food stamps, and more. This is just transferring the cost of labor from employers to the general public.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as free labor. There&rsquo;s a cost inherent somewhere in the system. If not today, then in the future. Just look at the present day cost of slavery in America. For those few in the past, it was a windfall. But that &#8216;free labor&rsquo; is now being paid by every American in both economic and social terms.</p>
<p>Economists and those who support illegal Hispanic aliens tell us that without &#8216;cheap labor&rsquo;, we&rsquo;d have to pay more for food. I&rsquo;d be willing to pay more provided it made for a secure future for the American people. Sadly, too many people no longer consider future generations.</p>

			<p>Why are these people allowed to roam free in France?  Why are they not being rounded up and deported back to Iran/Iraq/ North Africa?  </p>
<p>The EU should concern itself with repatriations of illegals, not enabling them.</p>

			<p>I just read an article that stated that 300,000 illegal aliens live in residential garages in Los Angeles County.  Even if immigrants are NOT using HUD housing, etc., they destroy the quality of life of citizens.</p>
<p>Build the wall, and build it high.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We know that Britain offers free accommodation and food, but we also want to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain is entirely at fault.  Better hope the BNP gets in soon.</p>

			<p>They are alos happy to live in appaling conditions, recreating their lifestyle where they came from.</p>
<p>We sold our last house to an old lady who then sold it to an &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; couple.</p>
<p>As anybody in the UK will know it does not matter who you inform about a change of address these days post will still go to your old address.</p>
<p>On going their to retrieve the post we found mattresses in the living room, Curtians torn down to use as blankets and junk in the yard.<br>
The house was all but destroyed in 1 month. Old neighbours estimated around 20 people living there, in what was a small 2 bedroom house. They were not happy with us, but not my fault.</p>
<p>Thats how they afford to undercut us and thats why it really annoys me when politicians tell us to get on our bikes and compete.<br>
We can&rsquo;t if we still want a decent standard of living.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We have great respect for the English, but&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this the uncoerced admiration that Albion&rsquo;s admirers are always crowing about?  As the Good War obsessives always say:  &#8220;We&rsquo;d all be speaking German by now&#8221;&hellip;in which case, this tsunami of African, South Asian and Arab immigrants would be Germany&rsquo;s problem.  Such a fitting demise.</p>

<p>These people are no different than the mexicans here in that they think they can come and continue to come and come and get some type of benefits. What they can&rsquo;t seem to grasp is that someone has to pay for these benefits and that someone is white people. When enough white people don&rsquo;t have jobs or have their wages lowered than there won&rsquo;t be enough in tax dollars to keep paying these &#8220;benefits.&#8221; In other word, these migrants will end up being the goose that killed the golden egg so to speak, just look at california, socialist policies with large amounts of mexicans on benefits. It&rsquo;s going broke.</p>

<p>Just like here in the USA, the problem isn&rsquo;t with the migrants but with GREEDY WHITES who hire them. These greedy whites care only for themselves and not for their country. If greedy white employers stopped hiring these people, be they Mexican, Iraqi or whatever, then there would be a whole lot less of a problem.<br>

			<p>The Beatles predicted this in 1969.  Believe it or not, the first version of the song &#8220;Get Back&#8221; contained the words: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t dig no Pakistanis, taking all the people&rsquo;s jobs, get back, get back to where you once belonged.&#8221;  There also words about foreigners crowding into council flats (housing projects).<br>
People have subsequently tried to argue that it was meant to be a parody of how people felt about foreigners moving into London  &mdash;  but it wasn&rsquo;t.  It was actually meant to be a straightforward political song reflecting the Beatles&rsquo; opinions regarding immigration, but they blinked and changed the words when they recorded the final version of the song, which was released on the Let It Be album.  The point of all this is that even the peace and love espousing Beatles recognized that England&rsquo;s doors should be opened to allow in people who would erode the standard of living, and that there were limits to the kindness that should be shown to would-be invaders.  Now England and the US are way, way beyond that point.  Huge swaths of the US are no-go zones, and the UK, well, it will be unrecognizable in 15 years.   </p>

			<p>They should all be rounded up and deported. They&rsquo;d stop trying to come to Europe soon enough once they saw Europeans meant business.</p>
