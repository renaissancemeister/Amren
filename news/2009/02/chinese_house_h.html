			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Calum MacLeod, USA Today, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A special Chinese tour group is heading to the United States later this month to go bargain hunting for houses at foreclosure prices.</p>
<p>More than 40 affluent house hunters from across China will begin a trip to Boston, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles on Feb. 24 in search of cheap homes to buy. Their goal: to find investment property and housing their children could use when they go to the USA to study or work. Their budget: $300,000 to $800,000 apiece.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is the first overseas buying trip for the real estate firm, whose name in Chinese means &#8220;search house&#8221; and which has organized house-hunting trips inside China. It may not be the last.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&rsquo;t force our clients to buy,&#8221; Zhao [Zhao Xinyu, a manager at Soufun.com, China&rsquo;s leading real estate website and the trip&rsquo;s organizer] says of this first group of bargain hunters, who are paying $3,600 each for the trip. &#8220;But if it&rsquo;s successful, we&rsquo;ll organize several more trips this year.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Hunting for businesses, employees, too</b></p>
<p>Cash-rich China, whose purchases of U.S. Treasury notes help prop up the federal government, is looking to recession-stricken America for more than just houses at the right price.</p>
<p>Chinese companies are on the ground looking for U.S. firms on the skids, says David Putnam, head of Asia for Houlihan Lokey, a Los Angeles-based investment bank that specializes in financial restructuring. They&rsquo;re looking for people, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the last two months, headhunters have been scouring America&rsquo;s decimated financial sector mostly for ethnic Chinese executives. Twenty banks from the Chinese financial capital of Shanghai toured in December in search of talent, the China Daily newspaper reported. Last month, the Chinese government dispatched recruiters to New York and Chicago for 1,700 people to help build the country&rsquo;s nascent financial services industry.</p>
<p>But houses are assets that individual Chinese with money can try to cash in on.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There appear to be plenty of others like [Shen Yue, a Chinese film producer]. Soufun.com&rsquo;s trip to the USA originally was planned for January, but it was delayed because the number of applicants outnumbered the spots on the tour tenfold. {snip}</p>

			<p>This is one reason why we ought to demand the halt to foreclosures.  The other is that it is in no one&rsquo;s interest to have millions of homeless, unemployed people of any race roaming the nation looking for food and shelter.  Imagine mixing them with the projected 55,000 felons that may be released from California prisons soon.  At a point, these people will just start to take what they need.  Supermarkets will require barricades and armed guards.  This is not a frivolous issue.</p>
<p>According to this article, Chinese citizens are only interested in nice homes in richer districts.  However, how long is it before many Chinese learn that the may bulk buy and become offshore &#8220;slum lords?&#8221;  </p>
<p>However, if Chinese cannot buy these homes for their &#8220;children&#8221; for study and work in the U.S., it may prompt China to stop  accumulating holding or our debt.  So we&rsquo;re done - no matter what.</p>

			<p>Before it&rsquo;s all over, I think we can expect to see more boarded up houses than we will foreign buyers, because unless they want to settle down in the midst of an ongoing conflagration, I don&rsquo;t think foreigners will be happy here for a long time.</p>

			<p>Here in Las Vegas there is a huge condo/hotel project that is being built by MGM/Mirage, but the majority of the money is coming from the Middle East. At least that is what an Indian(dot not feather)that helped design the building told me. If there is not drastic change with our economy soon the Chinese and Arabs will literally own this country.</p>

			<p>Many immigrants use that same playbook.  </p>
<p>Come to the West, buy property, and put the white race to work for you paying rent.  </p>
<p>Unless we wish to be a nation of slaves, working to pay tribute to foreign races, we must put blood ahead of money.</p>

<p>And what do we call this?</p>
<p>Is it simply the free market operating here, or invading colonists in search of theft and graft?</p>
<p>Moreover, why do Chinese need to find &#8220;cheap homes to buy,&#8221; so &#8220;their children could use when they go to the USA to study or work?&#8221; What is wrong with doing all this in China, or at the very least, North Korea?</p>
<p>We all know the answer to that, it would be a waste of time!</p>
<p>I say that we let these Asiatics invade with their currently inflated capital and endlessly ongoing excesses in humanity, and then nationalize everything they hold! Indeed: do unto them as they have done and have encouraged others to do, unto us here in the West.</p>
<p>Then of course, we can demand that China &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221; when all has completely gone full circle, through their importing of 800 million Africans and 200 million Arab Muslims into the &#8220;country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would not the Japanese, get a great laugh out of that?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>These are RICH Chinese.  They probably have intention of sticking around so they are kind of like expats.  They invest money here and send their kids to school here (paying international fees) and then they go back because they are well connected back home so the prospects are better.  </p>

			<p>Well, what did the White homeowners expect after they dumped their industrial base for an expanding Chinese industrial base, all in the name of ascending stock prices? All those shipping containers the Chinese shipped their stuff to America in are now EMPTY, with absolutely NOTHING to ship the Chinese back in return. Real Estate is all you got left to trade, right???</p>
<p>Heck, the US Congress can&rsquo;t even keep a &#8220;Buy America!&#8221; provision of any consequence in the so-called stimulous package, because some European whiners would complain.</p>

			<p>What is the exchange rate now? 1 dollar for 8 yuans? It takes several ex-pat chinese families to buy 1 US house. It takes 3-4 ex-pat chinese families to buy 1 US house. It&rsquo;s not what this article or what the mainstream media suggests, These are not vacation homes, 3-4 families living in 1 house is very tough. Plus, Most ex-pats aren&rsquo;t going back to china, so they get work for 10-20K a year jobs. This isn&rsquo;t enough to provide a good standard of living for their families. I notice alot of you and good looking chinese girls with older white guys, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing, but this suggests there aren&rsquo;t many well off chinese coming to America. The current dollar-Yuan exchange rate is so far apart&hellip;. If you want to see how well a country is doing, look at the status of their younger womenfolks. We hear alot about how china is getting rich from trade and Russia is getting rich from oil. If you look at the young chinese and russian women in the world, you&rsquo;ll see so many of them are working as prostitutes&hellip;</p>
<p>In New York City, You see young pretty chinese girls with older white guys(who don&rsquo;t look rich) everywhere.. this tells you alot about how china is really doing, and how many rich chinese are vacationing in America and buying forclosed US property..not many. Life is tough on both sides of the pacific.</p>

<p>At least in this case, if we throw the foreigners out they can&rsquo;t take the property with them, and what are they gonna do about it. After all, the Arabs did it to us in the 70s and we couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>

			<p> Chinese know what Section 8 is&hellip;and they&rsquo;re bringing it to a neighborhood near you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing&hellip;that&rsquo;s how it is. Just in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>Ever live near a Section 8 house? How about a couple of them? Ever watch a neighborhood go from good to bad because of Section 8?</p>
<p>Stick around&hellip;you&rsquo;ll get your chance. Sorry for the yet another &#8220;ugly truth&#8221; moment. But Section 8 is NOT just some boogeyman that may or may not exist. It&rsquo;s real&hellip;and it&rsquo;s spreading.</p>
<p>If you own a house, you are at risk. The only way to stop it is to pay attention and to organize. Your liberal neighbors will NOT help you. They&rsquo;re cowards with permanent blinders on. When you see the inevitable &#8220;for sale&#8221; sign go up near you, better pay attention. Especially now. Chances are the only person who can afford it is an Asian or East Indian. Possibly even an Arab.</p>
<p>They want the house for one reason. Guarenteed rent from Uncle Sam. They will usually come from out of state. Chances are they already own other properties in your area. Trust me, they&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Now, this is NOT just mindless anti this or anti that. This is what is going on, this is how it&rsquo;s happening. Where I live, in the Southwest, it is happening at an alarming rate. It really would scare you at just how fast our neighborhoods here are becoming Section 8. A dirty, ugly little secret that everyone is afarid to talk about publicly.</p>
<p>I write this in the hopes that some of our younger people will learn something. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at just how many people out there have NO idea how this system works. And as they vote more and more cowardly, sniveling liberal democrats into office, our cities and towns pay the price. Our future is comprimised all the more.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put an end to our youth learning garbage from TV. We need to teach them and show them the facts.</p>

The thing China really wants is complete rule over East and South East Asia. The ChiComs see that part of the world as THEIR turf. The USA has encroached upon that space by stationing its MILITARY in and around places like Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines. It makes no difference that those forces aren&rsquo;t actually in China. You complain about the Chinese coming to America&hellip;but you should be thankful that they don&rsquo;t bring their GUNS with them like America does.</p>
<p>China openly challenges PNAC (Project for the New American Century), the authors of who are among the most CORRUPT people in America, and therefore, the World. All America has to do to improve its relations with China is LEAVE ASIA&hellip; However, it won&rsquo;t be done because it conflicts with the &#8216;powers that be&rsquo; goal of having one world led by the USA backed up by military supremacy.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, but the Chinese are actually on the side of GOOD. Yes, that may seem counter-intuitive given all the fear-mongering, negative media portrayals, and seemingly &#8216;bad&rsquo; things they&rsquo;ve done. But it&rsquo;s the truth. I don&rsquo;t think they have any inherent animosity towards White people. If they do, it&rsquo;s because the European Eight-Nation Alliance TRIED to divide and conquer China back in 1900, and the British-Jews who forced OPIUM into their society. Luckily, China wasn&rsquo;t taken over and exists today to bring some balance to this world. God Bless China and the Chinese.</p>
<p>Those of you on AR who believe that the Chinese are the true enemy have been tricked.</p>

			<p>I know for a fact that some of those shipping containers that came to the US full of consumer goods went back full of HAY.  That&rsquo;s right, we import the products of an industrial society and export animal feed.  Well, as long as the containers are going back for a fresh load of cars and computers, we may as well send them SOMETHING they actually want to buy.  </p>

<p>A quick history lesson here Kevka; do you remember that little conflict called World War II, in which China did so well fighting off the Japanese invaders of their country? For that matter: Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines did just a smashing job of fighting off those same Japanese aggressors, with all the Chinese aid and military support they got. It is not as if the entire region would not have been reduced by the Japanese to utter slavery, had it not been for American &#8220;GUNS&#8221; and blood, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it so very strange and wicked, that the USA just waltzed right in and forced a military presence in the region, after China&rsquo;s great and patriotic victory to liberate it?</p>
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful post Kevka, I will really have to reevaluate my opinion of China now!</p>

			<p>Back in the early 90&rsquo;s the Japanese caused quite a stir with their purchase of American real estate. As I recall there was a major golf course in California and Rockerfeller Plaza in NYC. A few years later they sold these properties back to Americans at a major price reduction relative to what they paid. Who knows, these purchases might work out the same way. Nothing wrong with the Chinese giving Americans some of their money back.</p>

<p>Are they fleeing from the US dollar? And who could blame them?</p>
<p>Sure, so they&rsquo;re dumping their worthless dollars (before runaway inflation starts up and the dollar become even more worthless) into non-dollar assets.  </p>
<p>What other crown jewels in America are they buying up (and they&rsquo;re not the only foreign non-Whites doing this, BTW)?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens if they REALLY start dumping massive amounts of their counterfeit money pile (i.e. US currency).  Are you ready for hyperinflation?</p>
<p>They may also be doing this as insurance to flee China in case of massive violence due to rising unemployment from malinvestments.</p>

			<p>This is only the beginning.  With the country on a deliberate and unstoppable decline, with the majoity white population forced into third place, there&rsquo;s a fire sale going on.  The Chinese are buying up now because they know their government will be taking control later.  I&rsquo;m n ot joking.  If it isn&rsquo;t the Chinese, we will be broken up into several ethnic regions, just like the Russian said.  Something&rsquo;s got to give and it isn&rsquo;t going to be to &#8220;our&#8221; benefit.</p>

<p>Uh huh. A country of over 1 BILLION people you could see fighting a war with? I don&rsquo;t think even the Pentagon likes those odds with a regional superpower.</p>

			<p>China has approx. 1.3 billion people.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume 5% of China&rsquo;s population wants to move here. (The 5% figure is probably an understatement of epic proportions)</p>
<p>That means 65 million immigrants from China (a plane ride away).</p>

			<p>&#8220;I know for a fact that some of those shipping containers that came to the US full of consumer goods went back full of HAY. That&rsquo;s right, we import the products of an industrial society and export animal feed. Well, as long as the containers are going back for a fresh load of cars and computers, we may as well send them SOMETHING they actually want to buy.&#8221; </p>

I agree, Schoolteacher. Exporting something is better than exporting nothing, although I wish our industrial manufacturing (especially automobile) was revived!</p>
<p>I think China is the global military superpower of the future. I just hope it doesn&rsquo;t colonize the U.S./Canada!</p>

			<p>Selling a home to an Asian is a horrendous ordeal.  They will lie on every piece of paper about their income, their credit rating, their immigration status, what other properties they own, everything.</p>
<p>They may even want to use as a down payment fraudulent Deeds of Trust issued by Trust companies set up by Chinese for the sole purpose of issuing these false deeds of trust.</p>
<p>I hope the bankers enjoy dealing with the influx of Asians.  Many will not even use their own names so as to avoid criminal charges and civil suits when their chicanery and cheating is later exposed.</p>
<p>You think the illegal hispanics lied about income etc on their applications, you haven&rsquo;t seen anything until you see how the Chinese can lie, cheat and steal.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand all the talk on here about Indians and Arabs taking over us.  Unlike the Chinese, they aren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to compete with us. Go and observe the way their own societies are run. Please don&rsquo;t give them so much credit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting really tired of the Asian bashing.  Look at the facts:<br>
<a href="https://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/02/student-loan-default-rates-by-ethnicity.html" rel="nofollow">https://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/02/student-loan-default-rates-by-ethnicity.html</a>  Student default rate by race.  Whites actually have 2x the default rate of Asians.  So let&rsquo;s not dream up untruths.</p>

<p>I am getting tired of these defeatist comments.  You guys act like this is inevitable.  Why in the world do you think white countries would put up with this?  I seriously don&rsquo;t think we are that stupid or weak.  Look at what we have done in the past.  Are you saying that no matter how powerful we get in the future (if things turn around and we return to our past glory), the Chinese can still, and will, colonize us, and there is nothing we can do about it, &hellip;.. no ifs, ands, or buts about it?  If so, please explain why. How silly (and insulting).</p>

			<p>My ex-mother-in-law used to sell real estate in Palos Verdes, CA.  She said that everyone in the office tried to avoid serving the Chinese, because they would take their WHOLE family (in the realtor&rsquo;s Cadillac) to see EVERY house in town that was for sale, because the whole family would be chipping in on the investment.  They had countless questions about each and every house, that the realtor would have to research and get back to them about.  When the Chinese family finally picked a house, they would have the contract written up by a Chinese realtor in Chinatown, screwing over the realtor who had spent time, money, gas, long-distance phone calls, etc. helping them to find their &#8220;Dream Home.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I also agree with the person who posted above that the Chinese will turn in all kinds of false documents, and misrepresent everything, up to and possibly including their true identity.  A lot of foreigners are committing all kinds of fraud, including extensive welfare fraud.  If and when they are caught, they put on the dazed &amp; confused act   &mdash;   emphasizing that they are semi-literate in their own language, no-speakee-Inglee, &#8220;I sign name where lady say sign name!&#8221;  They are difficult to prosecute, and if the going gets tough, they simply leave the country with charges pending.  They can always find a way to come back under a new name.</p>

<p>Sailer is basically pro-asian Legal immigration. He keeps quiet about it because he knows that the victims of LEGAL asian immigration-such as myself and many others-would go after him unrelentingly.</p>
<p>Thousands of Native Born White American families have been severely harmed by LEGAL asian immigation. I&rsquo;ve posted about it on Sailer&rsquo;s website, American Renassaince and Taki.   Brenda Walker&rsquo;s website- immigrations human costs- has dozens of testimonials from the Native Born White American victims of LEGAL asian immigration. One horror story after another.</p>
<p>If you read Sailer, it is very clear that that he subcribes to the America is an-idea abstraction point of view. For Sailer America is basically an economic transaction. Sailer would have no problem throwing Appalachian Whites overboard in favor of asians. </p>
<p>I hold the view that America should be committed to developing the youth of Appalachia for careers in meicine,science and engineering. This  better be the White Nationalist point of view,otherwise, White Nationalism is not worth supporting.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americans survive when the asians weren&rsquo;t here? Quite well thankyou. We managed to put up to eight Native Born White Males on the moon. This apparently bothers some people including the LEGAL IMMIGRANT asian and its geneline in America.</p>
<p>When it comes the race replacment of Native Born White Americans at the hands of LEGAL immigant asians street by street,town by town and university by university and state by state: I AM A COMPLETE REJECTIONIST.</p>
<p>White Nationalism is about geneline,blood, history&hellip; all deeeply rooted in the land  of America. It is intolerant of the colonization of America by the chinese,hindu,pakistani,korean geneline.</p>

<p>By the time the majority of whites wake up and do something about it, it will be too late.  All empires and civilizations end, whether they be good or bad.  It&rsquo;s just a fact of life.  Being that liberal whites got Obama elected and basically handed the country to him, do you really think there&rsquo;s going to be any kind of resurgence anytime soon?</p>

			<p>Did you folks actually read the article? It stated a few dozen chinese were looking to buy homes in the area. That&rsquo;s hardly enough to start a colonization process. American Real estate is gold to foreigners because of the rules and laws we have. In Most nations, Foreigners aren&rsquo;t allowed to owned real estate, they can buy thru a native citizen. No matter how many properties are owned by chinese or other ex-pats or foreigners, the properties remain in the US. So it&rsquo;s not like the US is actually shipping wealth overseas. Just look at the banking/subprime mess, Foreigners brought 100s of billions of subprime mortgages. Now that the market has busted, they ended up with worthless papers, while US banks get to keep the US properties. Foreigners have lost 100s of billion of dollars in the subprime market, As the gov&rsquo;t adjust the new rules regarding forclosures they will lose more. This is something that many do not understand&hellip;. </p>

			<p>Courtney: You are right, we need to regain our self-confidence. We have dealt with these people in the past and can do so again. China has been a major economic power for most of the past two thousand years. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world if they become so again. We can still do fine. I also understand your frustration with white men and Asian women, as you have mentioned here before. But as a single, childless white male myself, I do believe that one of the reasons for this is not just because many white men find Asian women physically attractive. White women are at least as physically attractive, but it is difficult to find a nice, conservative Western woman today. Sorry, just stating the truth.</p>

<p>I really appreciate your post, but those last two lines you wrote, which I have quoted above, disturb me.  You say we are &#8220;at least as physically attractive&#8221;.   Well, gee thanks.  In the real world I would think that white men should be thinking white women are the most attractive, not &#8220;at least as physically attractive&#8221; as Asians.</p>
<p>Secondly, the excuse that &#8220;there are hardly any conservative white women&#8221; is lame.  If you marry outside your race you are a race traitor, no matter what your excuse.  If you care about finding the &#8220;perfect&#8221; (these days I don&rsquo;t know what &#8220;perfect&#8221; means) and submissive woman then marry an Asian woman.  If you care about preserving your race, marry a white woman.  </p>
<p>Guess what?  It is hard for me to find a like-minded white man as well.  But you know what?  I would never settle for a nonwhite man.  So please spare me the excuse &#8220;there just aren&rsquo;t enough decent white women&#8221;.  I am sick of hearing it, it is divisive, it is defeatest, and it is insulting to the white women who post on here.</p>
<p>And by the way, most white men still marry white women according to statistics, so if you are a white man who prefers a nonwhite woman, then you are obviously the oddball.  I am just stating the truth.<br>

			<p>This is how I see things&hellip; </p>
<p>To Courtney: I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.  It offends you to be told you&rsquo;re just on PAR with an Asian woman. You probably feel like you&rsquo;re the only one trying to repair a sinking vessel, while the men who are supposed to be your companions have already started manning the lifeboats or simply abandoning ship. You&rsquo;re right to be annoyed at white guys on here who like Asian women (or have Asian wives) and who amazingly still think they can be a White Nationalist. I agree it&rsquo;s ridiculous.  </p>
<p>To Everyone else: You should know that WN leaves very little room for compromise. You can&rsquo;t be with an Asian woman and still think you&rsquo;re truly supporting what AR stands for. It would be a delusion. You can come here, nod your heads agreeably, but at the end of the day, if you&rsquo;re with a non-white woman - what you did here would be meaningless. You would have wasted your time, because you embody exactly what AR is against. Instead of trying to defend yourselves, it&rsquo;d be easier for everyone if you just disassociated yourself from WN completely and got on with your lives.</p>
