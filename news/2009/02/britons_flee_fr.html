			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britons are among thousands of tourists fleeing Guadeloupe after full scale urban warfare erupted on the French Caribbean island.</p>
<p>Trouble broke out on the island earlier last month after protesters began rioting over high prices and low wages.</p>
<p>But the situation escalated this week after protesters began turning on rich white families as they demanded an end to colonial control of the economy.</p>
<p>The troubles come at the height of the holiday season, with thousands of mainly British, French and American tourists on the paradise tropical island.</p>
<p>Violence has escalated on the Caribbean island as protesters turn their attention to rich white families who they blame for their poor standard of living</p>
<p>Protesters were now targeting &#8216;all white people&rsquo;, with the media in mainland France describing the situation as virtual civil war&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Guadeloupe is a French overseas department ruled directly from Paris, and authorities in France have sent 300 extra riot police to the island in a bid to quell the violence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters are roaming the streets of the capital Point-a-Pitre, looting shops and restaurants, burning cars and vandalising public buildings.</p>
<p>Holiday resorts along the coast have hired extra security to protect tourists, while the airport is jammed with visitors now trying to get out of the country.</p>
<p>Union leader Jacques Bino was the first man to die in the violence when he was caught in crossfire on Tuesday while driving a car near a roadblock manned by armed youths who had opened fire at police.</p>
<p>Six members of the security forces were injured during shoot-outs with the armed youths as they tried to help emergency teams who were trying to save Mr Bino&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Dozens more police and demonstrators have also been hurt in frequent clashes on the capital&rsquo;s streets  &mdash;  which one newspaper describing it as looking like a battlefield&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Most shops, banks, schools and government offices are now shut in Guadeloupe and the neighbouring French tourist island of Martinique  &mdash;  where protests are also mounting.</p>
<p>Guadeloupe&rsquo;s socialist opposition leader Malikh Boutih said: &#8216;It is shocking to watch a police force which is almost 100 per cent white confront a population which is 100 per cent black.</p>
<p>&#8216;All the same elements of the riots on mainland France in 2005 are present here.</p>
<p>&#8216;We don&rsquo;t have the same concrete buildings, there are palm trees instead, but it&rsquo;s the same dead-end, the same &#8220;no future&#8221; for young people, with joblessness and a feeling of isolation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first protests began a month ago when the left-wing union coalition, the Collective Against Exploitation, demanded a £180 a month pay increase for low-wage earners.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy sent his minster for overseas departments to the island to meet with union leaders on response to the demands.</p>
<p>But the racial tensions which have been simmering for decades exploded into full-scale rioting, with colonial descendants who own 90 per cent of the wealth becoming the focus of the violence.</p>
<p>The unrest was further aggravated last week when wealthy white landowner Alain Huyghues-Despointes publicly criticised mixed-race marriages and said he preferred to &#8216;preserve his race&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In Paris, the violence has provoked divisions in Mr Sarkozy&rsquo;s cabinet with black minister Rachida Data acknowledging that Guadeloupe suffered from &#8216;a problem with the distribution of wealth&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Laetitia Delaprade, spokeswoman at Voyages Antillais, a Paris-based travel agency that specialises in French Caribbean, said: &#8216;People are scared. No one wants to go there and those that are there want to get out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tourism Authority chief Madeleine de Grandmaison said: &#8216;Tourism is fragile. People are not only cancelling this week, but also for all the months of February, March and April.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have a huge deficit of tourists ahead of us. At least 10,000 tourists have cancelled vacations in Martinique and Guadeloupe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Paris-based Association of Tour Operators has now classified Guadeloupe as a &#8216;red zone&rsquo;, meaning it is not endorsing it as a destination. </p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;Most holidaymakers to Guadeloupe are British, American and mainland French.</p>
<p>&#8216;None have been hurt yet but there is the threat of violence in the air and staying there no longer feels comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Guadeloupe&rsquo;s Tourism Committee said that the main airport had also been temporarily closed yesterday because of a lack of worker, but had now reopened.</p>
<p>A spokesman added: &#8216;It is very busy. Every flight leaving the island is is full.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>What will it take for Whites the world over to wake up to their own targeted genocide? We read this daily throughout the world and in America, yet the lemmings are still asleep for the most part. I have never been so ashamed of my own race as I have been for the last few decades. Not talking about the posters here, they get it, I am talking about most of the White people we run into everyday or in our own families. </p>

<p>I love this guy.  Really.  We need many, many more like him.  If all the rich white folks thought like this, the U.S. would never have passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Immigration Act of 1965, affirmative action, lowering of standards throughout society, etc., etc.<br>

			<p>Blacks have no more right to those islands than the whites.  Neither are indigenous.  But whites are to blame for importing cheap labor.  It&rsquo;s been our main problem for the past 400 years.  Will we ever learn?<br>

			<p>  Excellent.  I say all Whites leave all areas that are now or have been in the past predominantly occupied by Blacks.  Let us retreat back into our northern territories where we developed the most awe inspiring culture that the world has ever seen.<br>
  Let the Blacks have their little islands with no resources other than the revenue of the White tourist.<br>
  We all know what is going to happen next.</p>

<p>This will give us a view of the entire Western world in about 2012, maybe sooner if the economy tanks even faster than expected.  I&rsquo;m not exaggerating.   I truly believe what I write, and more and more experts are describing just exactly this scenario for the US, so I&rsquo;m far from alone.</p>
<p>Hopefully, by some miracle, we&rsquo;ll come up out of this severe crash before violence occurs, but it never has proven a bad tactic to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.  In fact it&rsquo;s really the snart thing to do. </p>
<p>And regarding these blacks attacking &#8220;rich&#8221; whites.  When is the media going to stop making excuses for them and admit that most blacks dislike whites because they&rsquo;re jealous of them and their accomplishments, because every black country on earth is a failure.  They attack whites whether they&rsquo;re rich or not.</p>
<p>Notice that the black government officials in Zimbabwe and South Africa and every other black nation are never attacked because they&rsquo;re priviliged and wealthier than the general public, but they would be if they were white.</p>
<p>Soon, Tom Chittum, Civil War II, and the many others, including Pat Buchanan and especially those of us at Amren, CofCC, plus literally 100&rsquo;s of high profile people will all be proven right, and I hope we can make the radicals eat their insults</p>

<p>So the blacks are getting more violent because Whites won&rsquo;t self exterminate?  Incredible.  Guadeloupe is part of France and blacks have no claim on it.  Time to bring in the French military and drive them into the sea.</p>

<p>Good job, people! Run off the very people who make it possible for you to have jobs in the tourist industry in the first place. They&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> come back, you know. But then I guess it&rsquo;s all Whitey&rsquo;s fault for not voluntarily submitting to torture, rape, and murder at the hands of blacks. </p>

			<p>Since the time of the French Revolution, metropolitain France has ben divided Departments instead of the traditional Provinces( Burgundy, Gascony, Brittany, et les autres). It is a fiction of the French Fifth Republic that some small remaining colonies such as Guadaloupe are Departments of the French Republic itself, as if the inhabitants were Bretons or Gascons. <br>
These overseas non-French Departments are a tremendous financial and military drain on the resources of the French people.<br>
These people in Guadaloupe are so ignorant that they do not realize how much their lifestyle is subsidized by metropolitain France. <br>
Just let them go, and leave them to their own devices.<br>
Frenchmen, let them be free. Not, of course, in our sense of freedom. Let them be free of our help and our influence. Let them be free to set up their own government. And in short order, after Guadaloupe has descended into the poverty, squalor, tyarrany, and despotism which characterize every Black-ruled country, and they come running to Paris for help, simply ask them:<br>
&#8221; But isn&rsquo;t this what you asked for?&#8221;<br>

			<p>The blacks will keep rioting until all the whites leave.  Then their island will become as impoverished as Haiti is today.  Then the blacks will cross the ocean in rickety boats to the United States, where a dwindling population of white taxpayers will fund their welfare checks.<br>

			<p>  As usual, I haven&rsquo;t heard one report about Guadeloupe from our controlled media. They are too busy either rhapsodizing over President Obama and his bogus stimulus package, or faking anger over some stupid cartoon that compares the stimmulus to a dead chimp. Yes, Obama is our messiah. Who cares about news that may conflict with that assumption?</p>

<p>Exactly right except that it&rsquo;s more likely to be Muslim mobs the native sucker-hearted British will have to flee, all because they are too cowardly &amp; foolish to elect right wing politicians who would try to save them (they just can&rsquo;t stand the thought of being called &#8220;racists&#8221; even to defend themselves).</p>

<p>Yes, surfing the internet this morning I found two dozen articles at least verifying our trend toward massive soacial unrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Growing List of Officials and Experts Warn of Depression-Induced Violence&#8221; </p>

Friday, Feb 20, 2009</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of high-level officials and experts warning that the economic crisis could lead to revolt and revolution world-wide - even in the U.S. - is growing every day:</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. Army War College in November warned in a monograph [click on Policypointers&rsquo; pdf link to see the report] titled &ldquo;Known Unknowns: Unconventional &lsquo;Strategic Shocks&rsquo; in Defense Strategy Development&rdquo; of crash-induced unrest:&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Texas Representatives Introduce Resolution Asserting Sovereignty Under Tenth Amendment&#8221; </p>
<p>Infowars<br>
Friday, Feb 20, 2009</p>
<p>&#8220;Texas has joined the states&rsquo; right and Tenth Amendment movement by introducing House Concurrent Resolution No. 50, filed earlier this week by Republican state representatives Leo Berman, Brandon Creighton, and Bryan Hughes. H.C.R. 50 cites Section 4, Article IV, of the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment, and the Ninth Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>NOTE:  I think Texas makes 21 states now who are involved in the movement to declare their states sovereign entities.  Now if that doesn&rsquo;t translate to positioning themselves for secession, I don&rsquo;t know what does.</p>
<p>And, we have a collapse coming from the other side of the Atlantic in Eastern Europe that we never read about in the MSM.  Mike Whitney says a collapse of Eastern Europe is apt to occur and that in itself will create a global meltdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Eastern Europe Primed to Explode?&#8221; <br>
By MIKE WHITNEY<br>
http://www.counterpunch.org/whitney02172009.html</p>
<p>All I can say is if we don&rsquo;t have collapse and upheaval on a tremendous level, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of influential people wrong.</p>
<p>Read the above and make up your own mind. </p>

<p>Just grant them independence. That ought to do the trick. When they&rsquo;re denied all government benefits of being a part of the Republic of France then they can turn on their own Al Sharpton-type neo-Marxist community activists/agitators who are always the white-haters behind the scenes who instigate the black &#8216;youth&rsquo; to rebel against the &#8216;white oppressors&rsquo;. I know for a fact most blacks in overseas departments of France would rather die than give up the advantages of French citizenship because without France they would be dirt-poor like Haiti and other Caribbean islands. On television a few years ago I even heard members of their Marxist party dismiss out of hand the idea of independence. Yea, they bawl that the white man is their oppressor but blacks are not too proud to take money from the white taxpayers of France while badmouthing whites at the same time. They know deep within that independence would mean an inevitable descent into a Haitian-style poverty-stricken existence.</p>
<p>Will blacks ever look at themselves as the real cause of their problems and stop blaming others? I guess never. It&rsquo;s just too easy to blame &#8216;the white man&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As usual not a word of this in the UK media. Now in the coming months the slack in the tourist market caused by these riots will be offered to unaware British tourists and others. Personally, Guadeloupe is another name I just crossed off my &#8216;places to visit&rsquo; list.</p>

<p>&gt; I have.  On CNN this morning is a ticker tape bottom screen note that Sarkozy is committing approx. 750 million (USD?) to &#8220;confront&#8221; the problem on Guadeloupe, although the place is not named in the quick blurb.  The riots had been mentioned in the same manner yesterday.  Let&rsquo;s see what all that money actually does&hellip;. ought to be interesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8221;Union leader Jacques Bino was the first man to die in the violence when he was caught in crossfire on Tuesday while driving a car near a roadblock manned by armed youths who had opened fire at police.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>There were not any policeman involved. Two syndicalists in their car were trying to get home while avoiding the roadblocks. They found one and made a turnover. One of the young criminal shot toward them.</p>
<p>The officials said later that the ammunition was a &#8220;balles à ailettes de type Brenneke&#8221; used for the boar hunting and that the criminal may have thought the men in the car were policemen.</p>
<p>And some afrocentric websites spread rumors about a french police or french military sniper.</p>
<p>Some TV reporters evoked roadblocks where the &#8220;youths&#8221; asked for a &#8220;gift&#8221; (5Euros,6.5$US) to let cars crossing.</p>

<p>Abdelmalek Boutih is a &#8220;french&#8221; politician of north african descent, member of the &#8220;Parti Socialiste&#8221;, officially the &#8220;social thinker&#8221; but has never been elected.</p>
<p>He was president of &#8220;SOS Racisme&#8221; one of the main antiracist association until 2003.</p>
<p>And he forgot to said every elected positions on the island is held by (massively corrupted) blacks.</p>

&#8220;&#8221;Will Guadeloupe be the next Haiti? Undoubtedly, the revolutionaries will be welcomed into the US, with results foreseeable to all of us AmRen regulars.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Guadeloupe and Haiti had the same History : two french prosperous colonies reluctant to the slaves emancipation decided by the french revolutionaries, who sent troops from France, wich lead to an uprising of black slaves and the massacre of the whites peoples. The surviving ones fled to North America or Cuba (with at least half of the french troops).</p>
<p>Haiti became independant. Haitians today are starving in their man made desert.</p>
<p>The French sovereignty had been restored on Guadeloupe. Guadeloupeans enjoy one of the highest standard of life amongst all the caribeans, thanks to massive welfare and public employement paid by the french taxpayers.</p>
<p>La Martinique, the next french island of the caribbean was then occupied by English troops so the whites there survived, kept their properties and later were able to reconstruct the economy in Guadeloupe.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&#8221;That&rsquo;s why the body count so far is 1. Black police would just spray the black crowd with lead.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Oh, and i forgot to mention some french TV reporter thought it would be fun to mix videos of Guadeloupe with images from Madagascar where the police don&rsquo;t hesitate to open fire. </p>

			<p>(Hopefully, by some miracle, we&rsquo;ll come up out of this severe crash before violence occurs, but it never has proven a bad tactic to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. In fact it&rsquo;s really the snart thing to do. )</p>
<p> Ranger, sad as I am to say it. Such a thing must occur<br>
for the White race as a whole to awaken. Some may think it<br>
extreme to say. But at the rate the White race is going,<br>
we will slowly become overwhelmed.Especially when a fair<br>
share of our own are empowering their own demise. And <br>
supporting non-Whites against us, by constantly vilyfiying<br>
Whites. I am among the converts of the worse is better camp. Unfortunately, but it is the only proven way it seems for <br>
Whites to pull their heads out of the sand. By the way, <br>
another good post. You know your stuff. And it is a pleasure <br>
to read your insightful posts.</p>

			<p>Why oh why, do Caucasian tourists continue to visit Caribbean islands, where the black populations are close to 100%? What do they expect to find there?</p>
<p>To me, visiting an island like Jamaica, St. Kitts, Guadeloupe or the Virgin Islands, is NO DIFFERENT from visiting Gary, IN, East St. Louis, IL, Camden, NJ, Detroit or Mound Bayou, MS, all of whom have black populations of at least 85%. If whites wanted to visit an island, why not go to Acadia National Park in Maine, which features a rugged seacoast? Or, why not go to Isle Royal National Park in Michigan? True, Isle Royal has a small (four-legged) wolf population, but I&rsquo;d rather hear them bay the moon than listen to screaming black people.<br>

			<p>This is nothing short of a race war against whites.</p>
<p><br>
It is also starting in the U.S.:</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
OBAMA&rsquo;S DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST EUROPEAN AMERICANS</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obama at one time or another has supported:</p>
<p>(A) Reparations. Redistributing money from European Americans (whites) to blacks, mestizos, and Asians.</p>
<p>(B) Criminalizing white parents who refuse to let their children practice miscegenation.</p>
<p>(C) Using &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; laws to silence any criticism from European Americans.</p>
<p>(D) Using Third World immigration to overwhelm European American majorities.</p>
<p>(E) Maintaining anti-white affirmative action programs</p>
<p>(F) Creating a mandatory &#8220;America Serves&#8221; community-service program to indoctrinate and deracinate young European Americans<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p><br>
From a sociobiology email list:  &#8220;Children of mixed, white-black, marriages identify 99.9% of the time as black and detest European Americans (whites).  Why?  They almost always look black (eye color, hair texture, nose shape, lips, skin color, etc.).  Obama wrote:  &#8220;I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother&rsquo;s white race.&#8221;&#8220;</p>

			<p>Guadeloupe&rsquo;s socialist opposition leader Malikh Boutih said: &lsquo;It is shocking to watch a police force which is almost 100 per cent white confront a population which is 100 per cent black.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Actually, according to Wikipedia, Guadeloupe is about 70% black, about 15% Asian Indian, and about 10% white. Sort of like&hellip; South Africa. I think Mr. Boutih is trying to draw a parallel to the Soweto riots in the 1980s.</p>
<p>As the other poster said, yes, it looks like they&rsquo;re trying to &#8216;Zimbabwe&rsquo; (or &#8216;South Africa&rsquo;) Whitey out of there.</p>

I guess the blacks realize the importance of black rule in order to take over the country and make it as prosperous and successful as that pearl of the Caribbean, Haiti.</p>
