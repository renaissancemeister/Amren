			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reid Wilson, The Hill, February 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and three fellow Democrats want the Department of Justice to investigate civil rights complaints against controversial sheriff Joe Arpaio.</p>
<p>The lawmakers, in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano sent Friday, are seeking a probe into reports Arpaio has used skin color as a basis to search for illegal immigrants in Arizona.</p>
<p>Conyers and Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Bobby Scott (D-Va.) want to end a federal agreement that allows the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to enforce immigration laws if the allegations turn out to be accurate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conyers and his fellow committee members accuse Arpaio of ordering deputies to search largely Hispanic neighborhoods in and around Phoenix for illegal immigrants. Those in the Hispanic community, the lawmakers wrote, &#8220;feel under siege.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Napolitano has asked for a review of the agreement, which allows local jurisdictions to enforce immigration laws, to inspect whether the program is being applied uniformally across the country.</p>

			<p>Racial profiling? Without a doubt. Why EVERYONE knows only White Europeans are illegal immigrants&hellip; that Latinos and Blacks from the Caribbean or African countries&hellip; were BORN here. Never mind their accents, inability to speak, read and comprehend English.</p>

			<p>Okay, let Arpaio send all these illegals that Conyers doesn&rsquo;t want deported to Michigan.  It&rsquo;s not as if Michigan has an abundance of jobs.  Any scant jobs there still are, the Mexicans will take from the blacks that Conyers &#8220;represents.&#8221;</p>

			<p>IMHO, John Conyers is quite possibly the most dangerous man alive. Obama is a mere piker compared to Conyers when you&rsquo;re talking about a Marxist determined to destroy America. John Conyers will not rest until every American city has been transformed into Detroit under black rule. I swear his dream is to turn Western civilization into a Mad Max movie where the Africani Criminali rule. Be afraid, be very afraid&hellip;</p>

Here&rsquo;s a coincidence. The SPLC is reporting on Sheriff Joe Arpaio on their website under the heading &#8220;HATEWATCH&#8221;:</p>

<p><br/>
And those aren&rsquo;t illegal? How do they feel? Relieved.</p>

			<p>Give me a break.  Arizona borders Mexico, which is the origin of most illegal aliens.  Or have people forgotten this?</p>

			<p>I believe you will find that congress critters will not take email or phone calls from people living outside their little district. So it is amazing that a Congressional idiot in Michigan would take a keen interest in a sheriff in Arizona, more than a thousand miles from his district. Why does he not focus on Detroit or something? Is there nothing the DOJ needs to do in Michigan?<br/>

			<p>Conyers and Lofgren. Why am I not surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Napolitano has asked for a review of the agreement, which allows local jurisdictions to enforce immigration laws, to inspect whether the program is being applied uniformally across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>uniformally?</p>
<p>If the feds and the DHS would just stop talking, and &#8216;reviewing&rsquo;, and actually get around to doing the job they are obligated to do&hellip;</p>
<p>Instead, local jurisdictions are being taxed twice to pay for the same thing. Taxed once to pay for the federal protections that never materialize, and a second time when local law enforcement must expend their resources doing someone else&rsquo;s job. Maybe taxed a third or fourth time if you count incarceration costs and all the lawyers that local jurisdictions have to contend with&hellip;both from the illegals and their supporters as well as the federal governments own lawyers, all of whom are intent upon obstructing any enforcement of immigration law. </p>
<p>So a couple of fringe democrats want Holder and Napolitano to investigate reports about Arpaio. How about some transparency on just where those &#8216;reports&rsquo; originated from, hmm? </p>

			<p>   If I were unfortunate enough to be John Conyers, I believe I would be working on trying to save the state of Michigan, instead of destroying the rest of the country. I think Conyers should live in a neighbor surrounded by members of MS-13.</p>

			<p>Memphomaniac:  That&rsquo;s because Conyers is being altruistic.  He&rsquo;s screwing over the black men and women in his own district, because all those illegal aliens will mostly take their jobs, for Conyers is thinking about Democrats nationally and in general.  He knows that those Hispanic voters will mean perpetual power for his party, in the U.S. House, when it comes to Democrats running the House forever.  Meaning Conyers gets to run whatever committees he runs for as long as he lives.</p>

			<p>Lets see now. ILLEGAL INVADERS are Mexicans so the best way to catch them is stop 80 year old white females. And most of the crime in the area is perpetrated by young black males so stopping white kids is pretty effective police work? Okay now I&rsquo;ve got it PROFILING AND STOPING PEOPLE OF THE GROUPS COMMITING THE CRIMES just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense? What&rsquo;s wrong with people today?</p>

			<p>Interesting&hellip;Just today a guy I know was telling me how he just got back from this said area and Vegas and how devastating a toll the Illegals took on the economy. Whether robbing or placing themselves in hospitals sick or pregnant or buying cars on loan and returning to El Mexico with car without paying Etc.. This friend said at least in Maricopa county there was a man up front enough to deport these law breakers,I guess he&rsquo;s considered evil for doing his job with courage and efficiancy.</p>

			<p>Conyers and all the rest of the Democrats do everything that they can possibly do, to bring about the ruination of the United States of America. With all of the problems this nation has due to the worthless slackers in Washington like Conyers, the last thing on these Congressional idiots minds, should be a sheriff of a border state doing more than his part to protect this nation against illegal aliens of all kinds, including murderers, drug dealers, and other such types. Sheriff Arpaio in fact, has arrested everyone of these type of people.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is out of control, and I have read about a State wide movement that is beginning to resist it. One area of resistance is government unfunded mandates that make the States pay, under threat of some penalty, for the medical care of people who cannot afford it, including millions of illegal aliens, which has bankrupted hospitals and emergency rooms across the nation. People like Comrade Conyers are bringing on this crisis between the States and Federal government. Perhaps it has to come to this, the slapping down of an out of control central government, something the Founding Fathers discussed in several documents. </p>

			<p>Conyers, an anti-White, anti-American ( same )biased racial bigot has the &#8221; Chutzpah &#8221; to question someone else&rsquo;s possible imperfection concerning race ? What &#8221; gall &#8221; and stupidity. Bigots that live in &#8221; glass houses &#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t be throwing stones.</p>

			<p>The Hispanics feel &#8220;under siege?&#8221; Duh?  </p>
<p>Maybe the Hispanics need to accept the idea they DO NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO SNEAK INTO OUR COUNTRY TO BEGIN WITH! Which that act of sneaking in is defined as being &#8220;illegal aliens.&#8221; I could also point out that all intelligent countries are somewhat finicky about people violating their borders. That they do not necessarily welcome illegal immigration for the obvious costs it levies on their people. A cost definable as crime, welfare (maintenance) and social problems.</p>

			<p>All the brouhaha about alleged illegality of racial profiling has been made out of thin air.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the Constitution or its Amendments that would prohibit <i>suspecting</i> a person because of his race.</p>
<p>If 80% of border violators are Mexican &#8220;Latinos&#8221; then the only logical conclusion is to be much more suspicious about a &#8220;Latino&#8221; traveler in the border area than about a white blonde Swede. And if the majority of &#8220;Latinos&#8221; in these areas are illegal aliens (which actually is the case) then this fact alone gives an officer a <i>probable</i> cause to stop and question any &#8220;Latino&#8221; wandering in the vicinity of the border (and in somne other areas infested by illegals, too).</p>
<p>All calls to end racial profiling are calls for self-inflicted stupidity. They seek to prohibit law enforcement from drawing obvious and statistically valid conclusions.</p>
<p>One more reason to seal the border and deport all deportable aliens.<br/>

			<p> The vast majority of illegals are from &#8220;hispanic&#8221; countries. Given the undeniable evidence, one doesn&rsquo;t look for Eskimos. You don&rsquo;t look for Muslims if your&rsquo;e tracking the Sicilian Mafia or Chinese Triads. <br/>
 Conyers is no better for minorities than Rangel. Conyers is a bitter multicultural clinger.</p>

			<p>Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, an outspoken critic of Arpaio&rsquo;s immigrant-bashing antics, told the Associated Press that today&rsquo;s parade was &ldquo;one of the most inhumane things I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just read the posted article, and if this parade was one of the most inhumane things this fool has seen/heard, then she has led a VERY sheltered life indeed.</p>

			<p>More idiocy.  Of course the vast majority of illegal aliens in Arizona are mestizos.  We know that, Sheriff Arpaio knows that, and John Conyers knows that.  Common sense says that if you want to find the illegals you search among the mestizos.  But in the new era of politically correct law enforcement we all have to pretend not to know what we all know perfectly well.  Double think is now as prevalent in the United States as it ever was in the Soviet Union, because the same sort of people are in charge.<br/>

			<p>I hope Arapio&rsquo;s response is to simply arrest the DOJ officials for &#8220;interference with a police officer&#8221; and lock them up in his tent jail.  If they resist arrest, tasers and pepper spray seem appropriate.<br/>
