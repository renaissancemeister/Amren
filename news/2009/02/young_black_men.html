			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roni Caryn Rabin, New York Times, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agencies surveyed 29 black men ages 17 to 25 who had tested positive for H.I.V. between 2006 and 2008 and who reported having sex with other men. Twenty reported having unprotected anal intercourse with a man during the year before their positive H.I.V. tests, and 16 reported having male sex partners who were 26 or older.</p>
<p>Having older sex partners increases the risk of infection because older men are more likely than younger men to be infected.</p>
<p>Only three of the 29 men thought it likely they would acquire H.I.V. during their lifetime. More than half thought it unlikely or very unlikely, the survey found.</p>

<p>This reminds me of that study where - despite the fact black students did worse than their white counterparts - the black participants still believed that they were &#8220;better&#8221; than the other students, so maybe the <i>it won&rsquo;t happen to me</i> mentality is just pure egoism?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering why they didn&rsquo;t factor in the black community&rsquo;s&hellip;&#8221;distaste&#8221; towards homosexuality&hellip;</p>

			<p>I have trouble imagining how anyone could really be this stupid; it just doesn&rsquo;t seem possible.  Let&rsquo;s see: HIV/AIDS has been a known, major threat to homosexuals in the USA since the early 1980s.  For a quarter-century this threat has been understood, yet we are expected to believe that 90 percent of the guys in this survey were having unprotected anal intercourse and yet NEVER THOUGHT IT LIKELY that they would contract HIV.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned these dingbats are able to function at any level at all; anyone more oblivious than these 26 guys would have to be put in a pot and watered twice a day.</p>

			<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were &#8220;unaware of the risks&#8221;, they simply didn&rsquo;t care. Poor impulse control and desire for immediate gratification are strong characteristics of blacks.</p>

			<p>Those men are lying plain and simple. As student who completed a black high school I can tell you form first hand experience that things like HIV, AIDS, STD&rsquo;s, and drugs were drilled into our heads like we were in some communist camp or something. For them to even acknowledge they have no clue about STD&rsquo;s or HIV that would mean they didnt pay attention in school, didnt go to school, or are flat out lying, plain and simple.</p>
<p>There is no possible way for them to get out of this one and I cant even think up a reasonable lie they could tell. Most of my black friends refrained from sex and they didnt catch anything.</p>

When I was working at the university, there was a photo on the front page of the student newspaper. It showed a lecture by a white college boy who was HIV positive. The posters for the event didn&rsquo;t a show his picture or single out that the lecture was by a white kid or that it was only for white college students.</p>
<p>The photo showed about 20 college students. All but one were white.</p>
<p>Last week, local news broadcast a seminar in the black community to get the message out to black youth concerning HIV. All the people in attendance were black adults.</p>
<p>How many campaigns have we seen that have specifically target minority men? Even in San Francisco, a few years back, they put up provocative posters showing black men at risk. Do any of these campaigns do any good? Even when the message is specifically directed towards them, they don&rsquo;t seem to get the message.<br>

			<p>Ironically, blacks often present themselves as being homophobic, and even like to say that far more white men are gay or bisexual. However, a large number of them are what the black community labels &#8220;down low brothers&#8221; who secretly engage in homosexual activity, while posing as straight, and even ladies men. </p>
<p>Often what happens is they pass HIV, and other STD&rsquo;s onto their women. Since women pick up HIV even easier than men, it explains why black women are the #1 HIV victim in this country, followed closely by black men. </p>
<p>Not only is there denial about their sexuality, but denial about where blacks stand today, among AIDS statistics, and further denial that it will ever effect them. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not buying this.  In this day and age, when AIDS education is ubiquitous, you would have to be either stupid or insouciant not to know.  Knowing these are black men they&rsquo;re studying, I think it&rsquo;s an equal mixture of both.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you get your &#8216;facts&rsquo; from beyond the Socialist mainstream media, but this is absolutely false.  I&rsquo;ve heard the same drivel from Leftists for a long time  &mdash;  that the most closeted gays are right-wing conservatives.  They also claim that democrats, though not closeted gays, are equally promiscuous, although straight.  Come on now.  The democrats promote and legitimize the gay agenda.  Do you really think Barney Frank is unique among the entire Congress?</p>
<p>Homosexuality among both Blacks and Hispanics is very high, probably higher than the White population.  The difference between them and Whites is that they have this code among themselves  &mdash;  it is known as being on the &#8216;D.L&rsquo;, the &#8216;down low&rsquo;.  Because both Black/Hispanic culture promotes itself as very virile, masculine and unequivocally straight, the gays within their groups are even more afraid of &#8216;coming out&rsquo;.  Whites don&rsquo;t have that pressure or stigma.</p>
<p>All reputable studies have shown that a majority of male homosexuals grow up in a situation where they had little or very distant contact with their fathers.  Homosexuals who grew up in a loving heterosexual married environment are very rare indeed, though not unheard of, compared to the general population.  That is not to say that all males without a male role model in the household will turn out gay.  I&rsquo;m talking about probabilities here.</p>
<p>Black males in this country have a 70% illegitimacy rate, meaning that these young men do not grow up in a situation with a responsible male role model around them.  Yes, most of these &#8216;macho&rsquo; gang bangers and hip hop stars were raised by single mothers, never knowing what it&rsquo;s like to have a father around.  No wonder their &#8216;machismo&rsquo; is so exaggerated.</p>
<p>Normal males who grow up with a straight heterosexual father as a role model rarely need to prove their masculinity to the world.  Blacks rarely experience that.</p>
<p>Just as children raised by gay parents are almost 30% to 40% more likely to turn out gay, as opposed to 2% raised by straight parents, Black males predominantly raised, if you want to call it that, by almost exclusively females, will naturally have more feminine proclivities, no matter how much they try to &#8216;front&rsquo; and prove otherwise to the world.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying here isn&rsquo;t just based on some academic studies, of which there are many  &mdash;  I have straight friends who grew up on the streets of New York City and have a lot of experience around these people from the &#8216;hood&rsquo;.  They all know how the gay culture in both Hispanic and Black communities is kept on the &#8216;D.L.&rsquo;  Hip Hop videos are the antithesis of normal male heterosexuality.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, read Dr. Judith Reisman on this issue.  </p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   <br>
So, because you can name a few closeted white male celebrities who came down with AIDS, you think that is proof that more White men are closet gays? How about black star Kevin Peter Hall, who died of AIDS, but was married to a Black actress? Or Black actor Gene Anthony Ray, of FAME, who&rsquo;s image was that of a street smart ladies man? Or Magic Johnson?<br>
  <br>
Rock Hudson succumbed to AIDS, back in 1985, when so little was known about the disease, that people still thought Linda Evans could be in jeopardy of catching it from him, due to a kissing scene with him on Dynasty. And not everybody was shocked when they learned he was gay! It was a secret, but not a closely guarded one. I even heard he was gay, as a child in the 70&rsquo;s. </p>
<p><br>
Back in the early 50&rsquo;s his agents did all they could to suppress the information that he was gay, because he made the perfect foil as a leading man, being 6&rsquo;4 and extremely handsome. But word later leaked out, in Hollywood gossip books and the like. </p>
<p>Either way, the stats in this country speak for themselves. Blacks are only 13% of the population, but are most likely to develop HIV and AIDS today. After all these years, they can&rsquo;t say it is due to ignorance. By now, everybody knows how AIDS is contracted, and how to prevent it. Blacks are most likely to take the gamble, and when faced with actual stats, they say no not us! It is their head in the sands approach to life, that puts them in such great jeopardy.  </p>
<p>They can continue to blame other groups, and continue on with their denial, and as long as they do, they will remain the highest risk AIDS group. Until they finally take responsibility for their own actions. But, I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath on that one.<br>

<p>I agree with you but the fact is that the manistream media has played a major part in emasculating White men.</p>
<p>White men are either portrayed as lazy bums, immature perpetual adolescents, racist crackpots, sexaul predators, effeminite wimps, deviant homosexuals, stupid dorks etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>For the most part, positive portrayals of White men are few and far in between. This is sad, but it is true. </p>

<p>Fortunately she became aware of his extra curricular proclivities when she overheard a phone conversation that was taking place between and one of his other partners. Needless to say, she dumped this perverted creep.<br>

<p>Drew:</p>
<p>The fact is that there are many White males that are closeted gays.Gina is correct. Secondly, if the examples you have provided are from Judith Reisman, the fact is that she her work has been fiercely challenged and discredited by a number of prominent psychologists as being skewed, purposely selective, and designed to marginalize, minimize and obscure the frank reality of White male homosexuality that is pervasive and rampant.</p>
<p>In short, Reisman has been accused of having an agenda.</p>

<p>While the media may play apart in such representations, the fact is that for far too long, many White men have coniunted to lose the ruggedness, masculintiy and discipline that their fathers, grandfathers and ancestors had. </p>
<p>Too many of them (not all of course)only want to spend all of their time getting laid, watching sports, playing sports, eating at all you can eat buffetts, watching porn etc&hellip; Sad to say, I count some of my relatives in this group as well. </p>

<p>As a gay White male I can tell you for a fact that homosexuality among White men is very much commonplace. </p>
<p>You would be surprised at the number of proposals I receive from MARRIED gay White men (Black, Hispanic and Asian men) too. </p>
<p>However, far more White men are married. Once I find out this fact, I rebuff them. I would never have an affair with another person&rsquo;s partner, married or unmarried. </p>
<p>Many of them realize that they have too much at stake to come out of the closet. It is a tormenting experience for many of them.<br>

			<p>For all of you on this board discussing the supposed derelict behavior of Black men being undercover gay men, the fact is that White eurocentric culture has always had its share of gay men and has largely encouraged homosexuality and bisexuality.</p>
<p>From ancient Rome, Greece, England, nazi Germany, postwar America, homoerotic and same sex behavior was common and considered normal. Even here in 2009, the number of White men who practice gay sex is tremendous. Hee in my local town we had a huge sex scandla last year where 26 men were busted for having sex in local parks, bathrooms etc&hellip; all where White, 22 were married, 19 had families!!!</p>
<p>Some of you cannot handle the truth. Brokeback Mountain is real in the White community baby!!!! </p>

			<p>if in doubt, look to africa - their motherland. <br>
it is a GIVEN that many, if not most black men are closet homosexuals. <br>
even though many have had sex with men, they are literally bisexual, and do not consider themselves gay, but instead consider themselves heterosexual.<br>
one more issue that shows the brilliance of scientifically engineering AIDS/HIV to blacks. <br>
too ignorant to use any protection, too unintelligent to think they might have anything, so they spread their disease internationally.<br>
statistically, scientifically, it&rsquo;s been proven that blacks get and transfer HIV/AIDS more frequently than any other group.</p>

			<p>Many here seem to have misunderstood the crux of my original point about homosexuality within the Black community.  I never suggested that there weren&rsquo;t closeted gays in the White community.  Nor did I suggest that there were more closeted Black gays in number that Whites.</p>
<p>Black males comprise about 6% of our entire country.  White males comprise about 30% of the population.  Of course, just by shear numbers, White gays will outnumber Black gays.  And because of that, just by shear numbers, more White females, like &#8216;Rachel&rsquo; will have bad experiences with closeted gay men, along with gay men getting propositioned by White married closeted gay men.  I&rsquo;m sure that very few white females or gay men venture into black neighborhoods where they would be more likely to be exposed to Black men who are on the &#8216;down low&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To Frank:<br>
I didn&rsquo;t realize that Daniel Radosh has been elevated to &#8216;scholar&rsquo; level.  His father was a member of the U.S. Communist Party, and Daniel himself is clearly cut from the same cloth  &mdash;  a left-leaning idealogue.  It should come as no surprise that a man who wrote a book ridiculing Christians would come out in strong opposition to someone such as Dr. Judith Reisman.  </p>
<p>And yes, I am aware that Reisman has been attacked, and many attempts to discredit her research continue to this day.  She dared to expose the bisexual pedophile Alfred Kinsey to be the fraud that he was, especially in his fictitious statistics concerning the rates of bisexuality and use of prostitutes among married men.  The NAMBLA website praises Kinsey and his research for being instrumental in promoting their &#8216;cause&rsquo;, which tells you a lot about Kinsey&rsquo;s real agenda.</p>
<p>Reisman&rsquo;s even greater, unpardonable sin, however, was to show how homosexual activists, without any scientific research to support their claim, pressured and intimidated the American Psychiatric Association 1973 to officially change homosexuality from being a mental and emotional disorder to a &#8216;lifestyle choice&rsquo; that is equally normal as heterosexuality.    </p>
<p>Heterosexual transmission of HIV in this country is very low.  The fact that it is 50% higher among Black males tells you a lot about how many of them, percentage-wise,  must be on the &#8216;down low&rsquo;, compared to the general White population.  Also, the rates of prison rape in this country are astronomical, much higher than the general population.  And a high percentage of those prison rapes are inter-racial, Black on White.  HIV infection in prison is a major problem.  And we know, of course, that Blacks comprise the majority of the prison population.</p>
<p>No one can deny that today the media and Hollywood love to portray White males as neutered, inept, ineffectual, androgynous, closested  &mdash;  anything but the way they were when I was a child, which was more like Lee Marvin or John Wayne.  I&rsquo;m sure that Hollywood waited until John Wayne was long dead before they dared to make a movie like &#8216;Brokeback Mountain&#8221;.  He personally would not have let them get away with such a perversion of one of the great icons of the American male.</p>

			<p>&#8220;For all of you on this board discussing the supposed derelict behavior of Black men being undercover gay men, the fact is that White eurocentric culture has always had its share of gay men and has largely encouraged homosexuality and bisexuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kindly provide actual data in support of the contention that whites are more promiscuous than blacks in any venue, homosexual or otherwise. A vague claim about &#8220;eurocentric culture&#8221; having &#8220;its fair share [what percentage is that, exactly?]&#8221; of gays does not address the question at all. Many black pathologies  &mdash;  intercourse with infants and goats as an AIDS cure, for instance  &mdash;  have no counterpart whatsoever among non-blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;From ancient Rome, Greece, England, nazi Germany, postwar America, homoerotic and same sex behavior was common and considered normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is so gross a distortion as to amount to a lie. Even the allegedly &#8220;gay friendly&#8221; Greeks condemned homosexual contact between grown men. You ought to read a serious book at some point in your life if you want to comment upon serious matters.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ironically, blacks often present themselves as being homophobic, and even like to say that far more white men are gay or bisexual.  <br>
However, a large number of them are what the black community labels &ldquo;down low brothers&rdquo; who secretly engage in homosexual activity, while posing as straight, and even ladies men. <br>
Not only is there denial about their sexuality, but denial about where blacks stand today, among AIDS statistics, and further denial that it will ever effect them.&#8221;<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.  Blacks and Latins are amazingly hypocritical   &mdash;   even with themselves.  They have a weird, distorted sort of logic.  They love to dabble where sex is concerned, but then they act super-macho, go out of their way to badmouth gays, and go  through mental contortions to convince themselves that they are not &#8220;that way&#8221;.  They&rsquo;ll even beat up a &#8220;fag&#8221; now and then, just to make themselves feel better about it and convince themselves that they are not &#8220;like that&#8221;.    They all think the OTHER guy is &#8220;gay&#8221;, but not them; they&rsquo;re just taking advantage of an opportunity.  It&rsquo;s always the other person.  No doubt the other guy is thinking  the same thing too,  but  in reverse.   </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting parallel to this hypocrisy in their attitude towards women.  They&rsquo;ll gladly take advantage of a  woman who sleeps around, but behind her back they&rsquo;ll disparage her as a tramp, a slut.  They fail to see that they are exactly the same.  Where is the difference?  After all, it takes two.  But no, it&rsquo;s always the other person who is slutty.   Or the other person who is carrying disease.  Never them.  They&rsquo;re masters at self-deception.</p>
<p>So of course they don&rsquo;t  think they could ever catch AIDS. They&rsquo;re not gay!  They don&rsquo;t do that  sort of thing&hellip;. (except just now and then!!!)</p>
<p>And Gina:  Anonymous was not talking about white men who like to cross the line occasionally; he was talking about black men who are IN DENIAL and cannot be honest with THEMSELVES.

			<p>To Cassiodorus:<br>
I completely agree with you  &mdash;  there are no objective statistics that show Whites to be as sexually promiscuous as Blacks.  In fact, the opposite is true.  If you consult Arthur Hu&rsquo;s &#8220;Index of Diversity&#8221; for rates of gonorrhea by race, based on CDC statistics, you will find that Blacks have a much higher incidence of infection than Whites, which would be consistent with other findings showing Blacks having higher blood testosterone levels, which would predict a higher level of sexual aggressiveness and thus promiscuity.  And as these criteria would predict, Asians, have the lowest incidence of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Promiscuity rates among homosexuals are extremely high compared to heterosexuals, which accounts for their high rates of a multitude of STD infections.  And their life expectancy is at least 20 years shorter than heterosexuals, regardless of HIV infection.</p>
<p>And you are also correct  &mdash;  homosexuality, despite the efforts of homosexual advocates trying to rewrite history, was never considered &#8216;normal&rsquo; by any of the societies cited here by other posters.</p>

			<p>&#8220;All reputable studies have shown that a majority of male homosexuals grow up in a situation where they had little or very distant contact with their fathers. Homosexuals who grew up in a loving heterosexual married environment are very rare indeed, though not unheard of, compared to the general population. That is not to say that all males without a male role model in the household will turn out gay. I&rsquo;m talking about probabilities here.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is total nonsense.  Studies have shown there is no correlation between homosexuality and family structure.  That idea came from Freud and is about as scientific as his other theories.  </p>

			<p>As an openly gay Black man who is attractive and in good shape, I can attest to the fact that there are many closeted White gay men.</p>
<p>While it is true that a number of men of color are on the down low, it is considerably smaller than the number of White men. I hae had numeorus White men (many of them married)approach me for sex.  Like another poster on this board mentioned, I do not knowingly engage in sexual realtionships with married men. Although, a number of gay men of all races do so. </p>
<p>Drew:</p>
<p>Please explain how you can differentiate between White men who &#8220;every now and then&#8221; have sex with other men and Black and Hispanic men who are &#8220;in denial&#8221; about thier sexaulity.</p>
<p>To me, (and I would say most rational people would agree), both type of men are either gay or bisexual. You can&rsquo;t choose to be gay or bisexual parttime and be devoutly heterosexual.</p>
<p>This sounds like the Ted Haggard explanation of sexuality.      </p>

<p>You clearly didn&rsquo;t understand what I wrote. I said nothing about hetero/homosexual rates. I said that &#8220;theo&rsquo;s&#8221; claim that whites are more promicuous than blacks and that homosexuality is a central part of white culture is simply false.

<p>Well, Rebecca, the common image contemporaries have of homosexuality among the Greeks and Roman IS false, something you&rsquo;d know if you&rsquo;d ever troubled yourself with learning about something before talking about it. What some Greeks had in some places was an acceptance of pederasty, though even that assertion has to be seriously qualified. They did not generally approve of homosexual contact, especially sodomy, between adult men. In extreme cases punishment could include the loss of citizenship, which was prized above virtually everything among the Greeks. If you would like a reading list, which is something you clearly need, I would be happy to provide a few standard scholarly titles. </p>

<p>Congratulations.  You repeated almost every cliche about homosexuality that the Marxist programmers have put out there for people to take on as their own thoughts.  You, and many other posters on this thread, have completely missed the original point that set off the disagreement, and instead have focussed on this canard that you are now falsely suggesting, which is &#8216;homophobia&rsquo;, though you didn&rsquo;t mention it by name.</p>
<p>The real issue is  &mdash;  have Black homosexuals on the &#8216;down low&rsquo; been protected much more than their White counterparts?  And that should be obvious to anyone who turns on the T.V.  </p>
<p>Every other day a Black man is arrested for some kind of sexual impropriety, including homosexual child molestation and prostitution, yet these stories never get beyond the local police blotters or local news stations.  When a White man is caught committing these crimes, it makes national news.  And that is why you think, compounded with your own limited experiences, that Black men are less likely to be &#8216;closeted&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>And if it weren&rsquo;t for the media constantly promoting these misleading images of sexually ambiguous White men, such as Tom Cruise, as &#8216;real men,&rsquo; I seriously doubt that you would have fallen for two closeted homosexuals yourself.  White heterosexual males are under attack, and even Blacks who are on the &#8216;down low&rsquo; are still being promoted as the &#8216;real men&rsquo;, the epitome of male virility.  Don&rsquo;t you get it yet?  The &#8216;race card&rsquo; has made it into your bedroom.<br>

			<p>Homosexuality is a sexual addiction that results in negative consequences for those that engage in it and society in my opinion. To see the government attempt to create a class system with homosexuals and feminists on top and everyone else on the bottom is disturbing. Surf on over and look at the white house website under The Agenda and see the new feminist and homosexual bully laws coming to corporate America. Is this the beginning of a federal government sponsored bias for the practice of homosexuality and feminism in this country to the detriment of straight traditional people?</p>

<p>Nice try, but your argument is flawed and false. As a former secretary who used to work in a police station in a very upscale New England town, I can tell you firsthand that there were a number of men from prominent families (almost all White, a few Asians and minorites from time to time)who would get arrested for participating in gay activity in parks, cars, bathrooms etc&hellip; </p>
<p>More than often, When the perpertrators were White men, these crimes were never prosecuted or officers would look the other way or the participants (especially if they were from prominent families) would get a stern warning to keep their behavior behind closed doors. Asian, Black and Latino men (regardless of economic background)were far more likely to get arrested, even if they were involved with White partners. Their names would be published in the local newspaper in the police beat and they faced all sorts of public humiliation. Women of all races faced similar public disgrace. </p>

<p>However, if you&rsquo;re telling the truth in full, then it makes that town look bad in this way:  You said it&rsquo;s in New England, so this town probably has a body politic that&rsquo;s liberal on race all the way, at least when it comes to opposing &#8220;white racism&#8221; in Mississippi   &mdash;   this would make them hypocrites.
