<h1><a href="https://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/02/04/america/NA-US-Obama-School.php">NY School Officially Renamed for President Obama</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>HEMPSTEAD, New York: Students got their wish Wednesday as their school was officially renamed Barack Obama Elementary School.</p>
<p>School officials believe it is the first in America to be renamed for the 44th president, and they said the idea to change the name of Ludlum Elementary School came from the children themselves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}[When] the president was inaugurated last month all 460 students were given navy blue sweatshirts emblazoned with &#8220;Barack Obama Elementary School  &mdash;  Yes We Can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s enrollment is 62 percent Hispanic and 36 percent black.</p>
<p>Nine-year-old Emily Philbert, who dreams of becoming a doctor, says her classmates felt it was important to honor Obama &#8220;because now we finally have our first African-American president. Since I&rsquo;m an African-American girl myself, that&rsquo;s a huge honor.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Last night I saw a segment on the news on Channel 4 (NBC)in New York about this and the news commentator stated that at one time the school was only for Whites!  I could not believe what I heard.  There&rsquo;s no school in New York or any place north of the Mason-Dixon line that has ever had a policy of &#8216;Whites only&rsquo;.  And the way he said it tended to make one think that the alleged &#8216;policy&rsquo; was recent.  It&rsquo;s incredible the lies that media can tell and get away with it.  </p>

			<p>This is New York, and the east coast, so I imagine that most of these Hispanics are Afro-Caribbean or Mulatto-Caribbean of heritage, not Chicano/Mestizos of the west.</p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t we just read about a college that killed off its longtime cartoon mascot because he dared to wear a coonskin cap and so wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;inclusive&#8221; enough? This was done over the protests of the vast majority of the students. And yet the students of this grade school ask for their entire school to be renamed and their request is instantly granted? Why do these grade school students know what is best for their school and yet the college students at the university do not? What about the (admittedly small) minority of students at this school who might actually come from conservative families and resent this school renaming? I thought we were supposed to be sensitive to the wishes of the minority. Also notice that the news writer  obliquely notes that the percentage of students at this school who aren&rsquo;t black are almost all hispanic and who seems to feel that no other explanation is necessary &mdash; a tacit admission that hispanics tend to vote as a bloc.</p>

<p>Precisely. I thought the same. As they are themselves mulattoes, they can identify with him very well.  Therefore the  62% who are &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; (ie. Caribbean-mulatto) and the 36% who are &#8220;black&#8221;  make a grand total of 98% who ALL can identify with Obama.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;the news commentator stated that at one time the school was only for Whites!  I could not believe what I heard. There&rsquo;s no school in New York or any place north of the Mason-Dixon line that has ever had a policy of &lsquo;Whites only&rsquo;. &#8220;</i>  &mdash;    White NY.</p>
<p>Certainly not in living memory.  I suspect that what he meant (but deliberately omitted saying) was that (just perhaps) at one time, long ago when Long Island was white, there were only white students attending there.   That would be true of many schools all over the North, but not because they ever  &#8220;had a policy of whites only.&rsquo;&#8221;    Talk about slanted reporting!</p>

My prediction:  There will be a steady trickle of events like this in 2009 and 2010.  But then the mood will die out and people will start to get bored of hearing the name &#8220;Obama&#8221; fifteen times a day. </p>
<p>Also, more and more left-wing groups will start to feel betrayed by him, and so there will be resistance to treating him as the Savior that he is now considered to be.</p>

			<p>The decision to name a school after obama, who&rsquo;s been in office less than a month and done nothing of greatness so far is so utterly stupid. enough said./</p>

<p>No, these Hispanics in Nassau County are mostly those who fled the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>Mestizos, not mulattos. Overwhelmingly illegal, too (I&rsquo;m sure that they have produced many anchor babies since I lived in Hempstead 20 years ago.)</p>
<p>Not quite as bad as the African-descended Puerto Rican and Dominican mulattos of NYC, but no bargain themselves. They do not get along with the native blacks of Hempstead, unlike the Afro-mulatto Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, who usually get along reasonably well with American blacks.</p>

			<p>I still find the ludicrously overblown(if typical)symbolism Blacks place upon the Obama presidency somewhat comical. What none of them seem to comprehend is this - they are all STILL BLACK! Thus, all the attendant Black &#8220;issues&#8221; we hear so much about are all still there. No magical messiah has changed this fact. 99% of these Black &#8220;issues&#8221; have little if anything to do with Whites or anyone else for that matter. And their magical messiah president isn&rsquo;t going to stop rampant Black murder, wide-spread drug use and sales, indigence and indolence, scandalously high out-of-wedlock birthrates, etc.  </p>
<p>Re-name every other school in America, go ahead. But Blacks are still Blacks&hellip;and in the end, that is all that matters. </p>

			<p>I hope the Nobel committees are preparing the prizes students in this school are now sure to win. No doubt the place has been a miserable, wretched failure to date, but now the juju magic of the Awaited One&rsquo;s name will exercise its mighty power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine-year-old Emily Philbert, who dreams of becoming a doctor, &hellip;&#8221; Don&rsquo;t they all? Try getting through basic chemistry and biology first, dear.</p>

<p>Precisely.  These children are being led into hopeless expectations. Many hearts are going to be broken; many dreams are going to be dashed. And there will be much bitterness when fairy tales don&rsquo;t come true.</p>
<p>Does every black child nowadays want to be a doctor? Hey, somebody has to do the heavy work. Who&rsquo;s going to man the assembly lines? This country needs more cooks and bus drivers than doctors. They should be given realistic expectations, not false dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can be anything you want to be.&#8221;  <br>
Sorry, not unless you&rsquo;re equipped for it.  That siren song just isn&rsquo;t true. </p>
