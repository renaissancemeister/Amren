<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5796953.ece">Met Police Hit by Claim It Operated Segregated Vans for Black and White Officers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean O&rsquo;Neill, Times of London, February 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An &#8220;apartheid&#8221; system of discrimination and racist bullying operated at a London police station, according to claims made yesterday on the tenth anniversary of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report.</p>
<p>An Asian police community support officer alleged that he and other ethnic minority officers were made to travel separately from white officers.</p>
<p>Asad Saeed, who will make his claims at an employment tribunal tomorrow, told in legal documents how one officer ordered a black woman colleague to get out of his patrol vehicle and into &#8220;the black van&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Saeed said that ethnic minority officers were subjected to threats of violence and that he was the target of &#8220;malicious allegations&#8221; that led to disciplinary action after complaining of racist behaviour by two white colleagues. One, he claimed, &#8220;would regularly boast that his family members were part of the British National Party&#8221;.</p>
<p>The emergence of Mr Saeed&rsquo;s allegations forced Sir Paul Stephenson to make last-minute changes to his first public speech as Metropolitan Police Commissioner.</p>
<p>Sir Paul&rsquo;s address had been billed as a trenchant defence of progress and change in the Met. But he had to concede that there were &#8220;remaining pockets of stupidity and bigotry&#8221;.</p>
<p>Met sources confirmed that the passage had not been inserted until after Sir Paul became aware of Mr Saeed&rsquo;s claims yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Mr Saeed&rsquo;s claims are contained in papers submitted to the Central London Employment Tribunal. The documents recount how Mr Saeed, a British Muslim, began his community support training in January 2007 with the intention of becoming a full police officer after 12 months.</p>
<p>In February that year he was posted to Belgravia police station in Central London and assigned to a team. He alleges that on joining the team other black and ethnic minority officers told him that two white community support officers were openly racist.</p>
<p>Ten days later Mr Saeed reported the behaviour of the two officers to his inspector and named one as a racist.</p>
<p>He specified an incident the previous day when he claimed that a black woman officer had been ordered to get out of one patrol van and into &#8220;the black van&#8221;, in which were the claimant and another black colleague. After the woman&rsquo;s ejection the van contained only white officers. The claimant reported that there was an &#8220;apartheid&#8221; culture among the community support officers at Belgravia.</p>
<p>Mr Saeed&rsquo;s complaints coincided with allegations against him by the two officers named in his complaint. They claimed that he had mistreated a vagrant who had been causing trouble at a McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant in Victoria Street, close to the Met&rsquo;s headquarters at New Scotland Yard.</p>
<p>A white inspector who investigated the allegations against Mr Saeed noted that &#8220;he appears to be putting forward that this is a racist matter against him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in my opinion this is a smokescreen but I am sure it is a matter he will try and exploit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Saeed was suspended after the allegations against him and subjected to a disciplinary interview in July 2007. He repeated his claims of racism at the interview and claimed that he was a whistleblower but that his complaints had been &#8220;abruptly dismissed&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to his claims of racist threats and intimidation, Mr Saeed&rsquo;s complaints also included allegations against colleagues gambling in the station common room, the sale of counterfeit merchandise, assaults on homeless people and falsification of &#8220;stop and account&#8221; forms.</p>
<p>At a full disciplinary hearing in February last year, three community support officers testified that the officers who had accused Mr Saeed had displayed racist behaviour towards them.</p>
<p>The Public and Commercial Services union supported Mr Saeed and warned the Met the case against him seemed to be racially motivated and that there was a &#8220;potential miscarriage of justice&#8221;. Brian Simmons, a union official, wrote that the disciplinary proceedings were &#8220;short-sighted&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite those warnings Mr Saeed was dismissed from the force. But the senior officer conducting the hearing also noted in a confidential e-mail that there was some credence to his allegations of racist behaviour.</p>
<p>The disciplinary panel was alarmed that other ethnic minority officers had experienced racism but did not report it as they did not believe that their concerns would be investigated properly.</p>
<p>It noted: &#8220;The panel found this quite disturbing and it appeared the lessons of &#8216;Lawrence&rsquo; were in need of re-learning, particularly for members of the organisation who did not live through the changes made by the Met in the wake of the Lawrence inquiry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Saeed was reinstated after an appeal. But he is concerned that official reprimands on his service record will prevent him from progressing to become a full police officer. He is seeking a declaration from the tribunal that he has been subjected to unlawful race discrimination and a review of the disciplinary action against him.</p>
<p>The two white officers he complained about have since resigned after being charged with offences of gross misconduct, a police source said.</p>
<p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said it intended to defend itself against Mr Saeed&rsquo;s claims of race discrimination.<br>

			<p>I have my doubts   &mdash;   British police and the justice system in general are notoriously lenient toward non-white criminality and vicious toward whites who express conservative views on race.</p>
<p>My contention is that the more liberal and pandering you are, the more likely it is that blacks will read you as weak and &#8220;chumps,&#8221; so the more likely it is that they&rsquo;ll accuse you and make up stuff like this (if it is false), i.e. they&rsquo;re playing the ghetto lottery, and they think their odds are better with lib whites.</p>

			<p>Was this a problem before Britain began allowing aliens to immigrate?</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism,&#8221; yet another &#8220;problem&#8221; the left creates with its policies, so that it can provide the &#8220;solution&#8221; (more leftism, more alien immigration, more statism, etc.).</p>

			<p>This senario reminds me of the classic scene from many a (Cowboy)Western movie. Where the bully gunfighter is shooting at some poor hapless victims feet, yelling &#8220;dance, dance&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this case though on one foot it&rsquo;s&hellip;. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d prefer to work together with my people&#8221;&hellip;&hellip; <br>
Self segregation, people who look the same, speak the same, eat the same food, or who are even from similar situations i.e. 1st or 2nd  generation immigrants or who come from similar geographical area&rsquo;s like to be together i.e. even Korans and Japanese (see Amren 02/24/09 story), or Pakistani&rsquo;s and Indian&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve seen the latter here often with my own eyes, granted to my surprise. </p>
<p>And on the other foot it&rsquo;s&hellip;..</p>
<p>&#8220;You racist&rsquo;s made us seperate&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
&#8220;Denying us non-whites the opportunity to assimilate into our well defined Western culture to learn your ways and traditions and to learn your language and customs. And of course we only treasure the opportunity to contribute, never take. As respect and gratitude are our only feelings towards you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bang, Bang</b>&hellip;&#8221;Dance, Dance!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Racism, racism, racism&hellip;..mmmmmmmmmmmmm, I sure do love that topic.  Every day on TV, all-night discussions on the radio, whatever did we do before racism popped up in 1950&rsquo;s Britain.<br>
Look in the papers - racism. Muslims, racism, black, police, institional, muslims, human rights, racism, lawrence inquiry, racism, race, multiculturalism, slavery, muslims, British muslims, muslim British, Muslims with British passports.<br>
If I were not an educated man I could be drawn into thinking that an excercise in brainwashing is being undertaken by the NuLabour government. <br>
(Still, it takes our mind off the fact that the UK is in real and imminent danger of going bankcrupt, I suppose).<br>

			<p>The problem is that in many areas the serious, especially violent and drug crime is carried out by non-whites and we have the anomoly where the black police have a black policeman&rsquo;s association to look after their needs like a union, but a white one is illegal.  The same applies to black lawyers so there is undestandable animostiy where non-whites are privileg latter being called racist and then fired.     Again the cry is that many more blacks are being stopped and searchd for weapons out of p`roportion to the numbers opf them compared with whites but as the police say, by far tHe grEAter amount of crime, especially violent crime, is committed by blacks so there is the reason.</p>
<p>A recent one was where a woman in a shopping mall allegedly objected to a man pushing into a short queue for cigarettes, and she phoned her partner on mher mobile (they never seem to be married) and he rushed to the mall and punched the wrong man who hit the floor and died due to head injuries.  He was not expecting the blow and was totally innocent.  It was all captured on cctv and the woman can be seen telling the killer that he had hit the wrong man who could be seen leaving the area quickly.  She has been found guilty of manslaughter (accidental killing) and the verdict for the killer is yet to be given but in my thoughts it has to be murder as it was premeditated.  I am retired in Spain where such evets are rae, but if I had to live in te Uk again, I would have to consider carrying a gun for self protection.  Five years in jail for carrying is better that eternity, early in the ground.</p>

			<p>Wow! What a tsunami of problems the British could have avoided if they had just not let these people into their country in the first place.</p>

			<p>Often derided as the &#8216;plastic police&rsquo; the Metropolitan Police&rsquo;s &#8216;community support officers&rsquo; are a singularly unmpressive bunch of men and women, seemingly recruited from deadbeats and duffers and who seem to do little more than walk in pairs up and dfown main streets (a case in point is a recent incident when a young boy drowned to death in 2 feet of water and PCSOs who witnessed the whole incident stood by like lemons not wishing to get their feet wet and literally watched the child struggle to death and die as passive spectators).<br>
  Anyhow, it is very likely that these useless duffers (and burden on taxpayers) were created specifically not to &#8216;fight crime&rsquo; but as a convoluted response from HM Government to inject &#8216;more diversity&rsquo; into the Met. as the force has been in a virtual state of mental breakdown over the &#8216;race&rsquo; issue (much worse than the self-flagellation seen in any US institution), for the past 15 years due mainly to the &#8216;Stephen Lawrence&rsquo; affair that was exploited to the uttmost hilt by profesional race agitators and lefties, mainly the East Indian Suresh Grover (let that be a warning to you Americans about the cunning and medacity of this ethnicity that you, extremely foolishly, are importing by the million).</p>
