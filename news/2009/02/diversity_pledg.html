<h1>Diversity Pledge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karin Agness, National Review Online, February 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At the University of Virginia&rsquo;s law school, the Student Bar Association is encouraging students to sign the &#8220;2009 Diversity Pledge.&#8221; The first 500 students even get a free T-shirt.</p>
<p>The pledge is not enforceable as of yet. {snip}<blockquote><b>2009 Diversity Pledge</b></p>
<p>As a community, we believe that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Every person has worth as an individual. Every person is entitled to dignity and respect, regardless of class, color, disability, gender, nationality, race, or sexual orientation. Thoughts and acts of prejudice have no place in the UVA Law community.</p>
<p>Therefore, we pledge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>To treat all people with dignity and respect, to discourage others&rsquo; prejudice in all its forms, and to strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding;</p>
<p>And from this day forward,</p>
<p>Knowing that both the UVA Law community and the world will be a better place because of our efforts, we will incorporate this pledge into our daily lives.</blockquote><br>

			<p>Is this supposed to replace the Pledge of Allegiance?  No longer are we to look on someone as a fellow American but we are all equal as citizens of the world, where our culture must not be seen as superior or even preferable but all cultures and all life styles must be seen as being equal. If someone in fact does better than one of their fellow classmates it must therefore be due to ignorance and hattred towards the other members of the class. </p>

			<p>They do the same thing every year.   When I was a student there the controversy related to the fact that they wanted to publish the names of those who signed it and, thus, harass, ostracize, etc.,  those who hadn&rsquo;t &#8220;seen the light.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I once attended a day-long legal seminar in Washington State in which I had to swear an allegance to promote something called &#8220;proportionality&#8221; in the workplace.  I never did figure out what exactly it was that I promising to do.  It was sprung on us during the last half hour of the day, and in the best communistic fashion, we couldn&rsquo;t leave until we publicly affixed our signatures to a pre-prepared document.  That was 10 years ago and I&rsquo;m still angry about it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the White Pledge:<br>
<i>We pledge to &#8220;represent&#8221; ourselves with minorities that loathe us, in the name of &#8220;equality&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221;. We pledge our jobs to less-qualified non-whites, as it&rsquo;s &#8220;unfair&#8221; and &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; if they do not outnumber whites in said jobs. And lastly, we pledge to keep our heads firmly in the sand, as we are demographically replaced from our towns, cities, counties, states, regions, provinces and homelands in the face by an unending brown tide - Hail St. Obama, Patron Saint of Diversity and Multiculturalism!</i></p>

<p>But who defines what is and is not prejudice?</p>
<p>Would admitting a lower scoring black student over a higher scoring white student be a form of prejudice?</p>
<p>Would preferring to live in a community that represents one&rsquo;s ethnic and racial background be a form of prejudice?</p>
<p>Would stating a statistical fact  &mdash;  that blacks are much more likely to commit an act of violence and therefore much more likely to be incarcerated  &mdash;  be a form of prejudice?</p>

			<p>I was asked to sign a similar pledge at an Ivy League graduate business school a few years back.  I simply refused to do so and so did a few others (in particular those getting concurrent law degrees). The wording was similarly vague that I knew if anyone ever took offense to something that I said I would be found in violation of the pledge and potentially subject to disciplinary proceedings.  I figured at the time there was no need to give the school administration any ammo to use against me. Fortuntately, like the the UVA pledge, ours was not mandatory.</p>

			<p>Too funny.  Hahaha.</p>
<p>The way they stab each other in the back, gossip unmercifully about one another, and crush many knuckles on their desperate climb trying to get higher on the ladder, this pledge is a meaningless piece of drivel that will be cast aside the first time it interferes with their underhanded ambitions.  I mean, if it is given any serious consideration at all.</p>
<p>Besides whoever heard of a lawyer with morals and ethics?  That&rsquo;s like bigfoot.  You hear a lot about them, but no one has ever seen one.</p>

			<p>When people purge religion from their life, this is the sort of nonsense they replace it with.  Humans just seem to need to inflict beliefs on each other.  Even without a god, you still have heresy, but it&rsquo;s now a secular heresy, that of not being sufficiently devoted to Diversity. </p>
<p>Those of us who know this is Extremely Silly need to say so often &amp; loud, for the sake of those who haven&rsquo;t yet figured it out. </p>

			<p>As the pledge is entered into under duress - i.e. you can&rsquo;t leave until you sign - then the contract/pledge is unenforceable on its face.  Its void.  You didn&rsquo;t sign under your own free will.  Basic business/contract law.  You signed under threat, duress and coercion.</p>

<p>This is a particularly disturbing clause. According to the pledge, even a thought of prejudice, whatever that entails, has no place on campus.  So much for diversity of opinion.  I suppose - according to the pledge - the only racial inference that would be tolerated is that blacks and latinos are inherently disadvantaged and whites are responsible.  </p>

			<p>This all reminds me that Michelle Obama&rsquo;s (highly paid) job was as &#8220;director of diversity&#8221; or somesuch. In this job, I suppose, she could Stick it to the Man and get paid for it! What a country. This &#8220;diversity&#8221; is just a sort of legal way to perpetuate quotas. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;To treat all people with dignity and respect, to discourage others&rsquo; prejudice in all its forms, and to strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would like to see some of that high sounding mutual respect given to Jared Taylor.  It is important that the college students, especially law students, understand his ideas and his position on American culture and race relations.</p>
<p>Of course their objection to him will conveniently fall outside their special classes of people, limited to class, color, disability, gender, nationality, race, or sexual orientation.  <br>
But if Taylor were a penniless, blind, black albino cross dressing male lesbian from Togo they would still not want to hear what he had to say.  </p>
<p>What they mean by respect really is proper respect.  When they say respect what the student thinks is proper respect; a respect that is earned.  But what the activist wants is to obligate the pledge taker to give respect beyond what is deserving.  You can treat a homosexual with dignity and respect him, but you don&rsquo;t want him any where near your grand sons.  That is the proper respect.  </p>
<p>You can give a person of a different color or race the proper respect, but want him living no where near you or your family.</p>
<p>Every one has prejudices.  No one wants a blind taxi driver, a woman priest, a man for a wife, a homeless man as financial advisor, a Mexican for President of the USA.  It is our prejudices that keep us from harm.</p>
<p>These are all classes of people.  What the pledge is saying is don&rsquo;t classify people and treat them in the way that people have been successfully treating them for at least the last 5,000 years.  We are alive and successful today because our ancestors were wisely prejudiced.  Give your prejudices their proper respect.<br>

			<p>&#8220;that was ten years ago and I`m still angry about it.&#8221;-Anon<br>
Thanks for making me realize I was right to refuse to swear a diversity oath. In my case I simply and steadfastly announced to the class that I would only swear an oath of ANY kind for either military induction or before giving court testimony. A few students came up to me after the confrontation, all were supportive, even the ones who signed and the diverse ones. <br>
 This whole set up/knock down reminds me of working at an Applebee`s of all places. We were opening a new store and had to attend a Corporate Apple Boot Camp for two weeks to earn the job. When ever a trainer or manager  had a request or announcement, he would shout out &#8220;Cool?!?&#8221; In response we had to reply in Marine Corps fashion, &#8220;Way Cool!&#8221;  For example the trainer would announce, &#8220;Today we learn how to make  our signature ice cream drinks&hellip; Cool?!?&#8221;  Our top of our lungs reply, &#8220;Way cool!&#8221; Finally one night after eight hours of this our trainer announced, &#8220;Tonight no ones going home. We`re gonna punch out but stay overnight off the clock and clean the entire restraunt till daybreak&hellip;Cool?!?&#8221;  That was My THEY GOT ME moment. But it was my buddy Terry who picked up on and tied in the extra layer of sleep deprivation with the whole obedience factor&hellip;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a fabulous idea.  As long as it includes white people as deserving of dignity and respect.  If white people are also classified as a &#8220;protected, preferred race&#8221; along with all the other races, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>I took a post-graduate course in post-secondary education and had to read a &#8220;bell hooks&#8221; virulent anti-white screed as one of the assigned textbooks.  Talk about creating a confrontational, disrespectful environment for white students.  Yes, I complained to the university.</p>

			<p>It should read like this.</p>
<p>Every person has worth as an individual unless you are white. Every person is entitled to dignity and respect, regardless of class, color, disability, gender, nationality, race, or sexual orientation, with white heterosexual males being the exception.</p>
<p>To treat all people with dignity and respect, to discourage others&rsquo; prejudice in all its forms, and to strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding; knowing that white people are inherently evil.</p>

			<p>When I was a young guy ( still am young), I recall now how diversity gave me a really creepy feeling. </p>
<p>I started to experience diversity around the age of 12 and 13. It felt so weird for me being around nonwhites. It was profoundly alienating, even though it took me years to realize what was making me feel this way. Working or going to school with them felt &#8220;wrong&#8221; like unnatural for me. It took awhile for this subconscious feeling to come through into my conscious mind, but I realized it was the diversity that was freaking me out. All the while I was an anti-racist being indoctrinated from the system, but being around non-whites alarms me on a level that goes deeper than any conscious response. I respond to it like it were atmospheric pressure, something you sense deeply but aren&rsquo;t sure what it means. I just begin to dislike the place itself and the work I am doing there, and feel like I have to get away from this. It becomes imperative for me to get away from diverse places just because of this gut feeling - which I suspect 80%+ of white people also have. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s written by juvenile reasoners. One is in violation of the code simply by reading it - he has a &#8220;thought&#8221; of &#8220;prejudice&#8221; when pledging against it. </p>
