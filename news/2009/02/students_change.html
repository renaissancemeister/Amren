<h1>Students: Change Boulder High name to Barack Obama High</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Gathright, Rocky Mountain News, February 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Boulder High student group is pushing to rename the school after a hot new historic figure: Barack Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;We initiate this campaign in order to honor the momentous achievement of his election as an African-American, inspire the community with his ideals of unity and hope, and reflect the progressive spirit that is shared by both Barack Obama and our school environment,&#8221; the Student Worker Club said in a press release today.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s president, Ben Raderstorf, stressed in the statement that it scheduled a campus press conference to pitch the Obama High plan on Thursday, &#8220;the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s birth to commemorate both the role he had in making the election of Barack Obama possible and the social progress that has been made since he issued the emancipation proclamation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Principal Bud Jenkins doesn&rsquo;t anticipate a rush to rename Colorado&rsquo;s oldest established high school, founded in 1875.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, it would take approval by the Boulder Valley School District Board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;With all due respect to the president,&#8221; the principal added, &#8220;of all the things in the world that need to be changed, Boulder High School&rsquo;s name is probably way down the list.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;But we also see that names and symbolism are really a lot more important than just a name,&#8221; the club president [Raderstorf] added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really will serve to inspire the community, inspire the students and really make much more of a difference than just putting up a new sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A longtime social protest group, Student Worker&rsquo;s members made headlines in September 2007 by protesting the school&rsquo;s daily ritual of students voluntarily saying the Pledge of Allegiance when it&rsquo;s broadcast on the intercom.</p>

			<p>Three weeks on the job is more than enough to declare his presidency an smashing success. Are there any real &#8216;workers&rsquo; in Boulder? Or do children of Marxist professors now count as &#8216;workers&rsquo;?</p>

			<p>You cannot blame these children unfortunately. They have literally been brainwashed from birth with all things egalitarian. I do blame the adults for not stepping in and suggesting they wait until HeWhoCanDoNoWrong is in office for at least a whole term before the unprecedented renamings and such commence!   </p>

			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to change your school&rsquo;s name to Obama High if you were a high school student?  That way, you&rsquo;d get to a be a perennial benchwarmer on the basketball team, smoke weed and snort coke with impunity, ditch most of your classes, and still graduate with a high enough GPA to get into the Ivy League.  That&rsquo;s change you can believe in.</p>

			<p>As a Barack Obama supporter, I am opposed to naming schools, streets, building, or highways after BARACK OBAMA. He hasnt been in office for atleast four years for it to count. What if he dies tomorrow or becomes an oppresor?</p>
<p>These people need to think before they rename something.</p>

 Reminds me of the &#8220;Mr. M Commandos&#8221;. Mr. M`s was the name of  the Quicky-Mart store and video game parlor across  from our  High School.  Mr. M Commandos was the coaches name for the anti-social kids in Vietnam  era surplus jackets  who smoked pot before class. They would  would rejoin the pep rally in time to give our school song their own unique inflection,<br>

<p>As for the &#8220;student&#8221; effort, being young myself, at least for a little while longer, I have come to an acute understanding of young people and political involvement.  Mark me, there&rsquo;s a teacher behind this.</p>

			<p>It might be a good idea for the high school to be named for &#8220;The Messiah&#8221;.  When the economy goes into a depression, and Blacks start &#8220;wilding&#8221; and rioting, and King Obama is forced to invade Iran by the usual suspects, while all this is going on, it will not contribute to his image.  But something is troubling; these people are so out of touch with reality that it appears no matter how bad things will get, somehow King Obama will be made to look like it&rsquo;s not his fault, that it&rsquo;s all the fault of the evil Bush administration and that Hussein Obama can do no wrong.  Gonna be an interestin&rsquo; time one way or another.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;It really will serve to inspire the community, inspire the students .  .  . &#8220;</i></p>
<p>Note the magic word, &#8220;inspire.&#8221; This word is getting a lot of use, because Obama hasn&rsquo;t actually accomplished anything to refer to. Instead, his great achievement is to &#8220;inspire&#8221; anyone who is so inclined. </p>
<p>Doubltess, years after his time as president is over, people will mold the story about him using this same word. He &#8220;inspired&#8221; every good thing that happened while he was around, and &#8220;struggled against&#8221; every bad thing that happened. Niether of these verbs require actual achievements on Obama&rsquo;s part.<br>

There are, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, laws against stamps and even license plates honoring LIVING individuals   &mdash;   no matter how distinguished they might be. This is because, as long as a person is alive, there remains the chance that they could CHANGE (there&rsquo;s that word again!) and disgrace themselves. They could turn out to be not the person everyone thought they were. They could be charged with crimes, they could go to prison, they could do ALL KINDS of things that make them fall from grace. To put it bluntly: the only people GUARANTEED not to screw up are DEAD people! </p>
<p>I remember this because at the height of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s popularity there were people in his birth state of Indiana making noises about getting him on the license plates (if only as an optional, &#8220;vanity&#8221; type plate) saying something like &#8220;Indiana, Birthplace of Michael Jackson.&#8221; This never came to pass   &mdash;   which was a darned lucky thing considering the horrific behaviors Jackson was being investigated for a few years later!</p>
<p>The same should apply to naming schools, public buildings, etc, after Obama   &mdash;   or any other living, working politician, for that matter. He&rsquo;s popular NOW, yes   &mdash;   but before his four years are up, WHO KNOWS how he&rsquo;ll be regarded? Between now and 2012, ANYTHING could happen! (And my guess is, it probably WILL!) </p>

<p>I agree with the above poster that there&rsquo;s a teacher behind this.  Most are brainwashed zombies.</p>
<p>But the biggest influence is years of mind controil and indoctrination from textbooks and curriculum filled with blad face lies.</p>
<p>The text books in the community college in my area states that blacks haven&rsquo;t reached the level of whites because of slavery, of course not mentioning that every other foreign student that comes to this country outperforms them.</p>
<p>Putting these spoiled brats in a black environment would straighten them out in record time.<br>

			<p>People say that Ronald Reagan was unduly glorified by the right-wingers&hellip;yet where were all the calls for school renamings when he was elected? I never heard of any.</p>
<p>Of course, Obama has shown us that &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; and that&rsquo;s why his election is so significant. The fact that a &#8220;black&#8221; man has gotten elected matters soooo much, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter at the same time. Have you got that? It&rsquo;s one of the many contradictions of multiculturalism, otherwise known as &#8220;doublethink.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as far as this &#8220;Student Worker&rsquo;s&#8221; union, their name sounds uncomfortably communist.</p>

<p>Several years ago, I read an e-zine whose name I can&rsquo;t remember.  The article&rsquo;s point was the with the rise of the ubiquitous internet, for some people, there is no specific need to live anywhere.  So they move to where they&rsquo;re most comfortable politically.</p>
<p>The article cited Boulder   &mdash;   it was already somewhat liberal because of the U., so it attracted white liberals fleeing California and the problems they created.  Those new libs made Boulder even more liberal, which attracted even crazier liberals, which made it even crazier liberal, which attracted even more extreme liberals&hellip;a dynamo effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that every place is becoming more like everywhere else, it&rsquo;s that every place is becoming more and more of a ridiculous caricature of itself.</p>

And as far as BHO and MLK are concerned, MLK wanted his people to be recognized by the content of their character, not the color of there skin.  I am sure he has rolled in his grave many many times.  Other than being dark in color, the two have/had very different ideas.  American needs a President.    </p>

			<p>Colorado is now made up of many fruits and nuts that fled California, so Colorado will more and more have silly ideas thus mirroring the fruits and nuts in California. Not many people away from the area know this, but the surrounding states to Colorado refer to people from Colorado as &#8220;greeners&#8221; which is not a compliment!  Their reputation is the same as that of California, nothing to be taken serious and a state made up of fruits and nuts!</p>

I spent a lot of time in Colorado.<br>
These kids are naive, they have no idea what it&rsquo;s like to live around blacks and mexicans.<br>
I&rsquo;d like to say I hope they never do, but I&rsquo;m sure reality will catch up to them eventually.</p>

			<p>  Boulder is the Berkeley of Colorado  &mdash;  the last stop for flakes from both coasts. Colorado used to be a rock solid conservative state like much like Vermont, but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s heading the same way as Vermont: to a false Eco-Multicultural brand of  Liberalism. Alas, they sow the seeds of their own destruction.  </p>

			<p><i>Mostly-white school eager to inspire community with president&rsquo;s &ldquo;ideals of unity and hope.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>As always, out greatest ideological struggle is against many of our fellow Whites who are weak-minded. Remember, nearly half of all Whites voters in 2008 voted for the illegal alien Black marxist, Barack Hussein Obama.</p>
<p>For this reason alone, our race is increasingly in very serious peril.</p>

			<p>I was not in favor of naming a Navy aircraft carrier after George H. W. Bush (Sr.), especially when he is still involved in politics. I cannot hardly wait till they name the next Navy aircraft carrier after Barack Obama. (Would be a lot cheaper to just re-commission the USS George Bush with a new name.)</p>
<p>Or maybe they will just put his face on the money. I suggest the thousand dollar bill. After the inflation hits from running the printing presses the next few years, you will need a thousand dollar bill to buy a hamburger.</p>

			<p> Most of Boulder,as well as many Cities and towns out west are where many California and west coast Socialists and Liberals from the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s and their children settled in after their idiotic policies and Government programs led to the complete ruin of their own communities where they orininally came from and now they want to destroy ours.<br>
 I guess they discovered they didn&rsquo;t believe in &#8220;equality&#8221; and &#8220;being close to the people&#8221;as much as they thought they did.<br>
I went to Boulder several times back in the early 1970&rsquo;s and it was an unspoiled and beautiful place to live and raise a family but when I went back about 3 years ago,it had totally changed and from what I could see,not for the better which is happening to so many other once nice places in America these days.<br>
 Liberal/ Socialist dreamers (especially Black ones) get into local Government and get a foothold where they begin implimenting their goofy policies,usually designed to give Blacks and other freeloaders a free ride in life and the whole community goes to hell in about 10 years,if that long.<br>
 Crime,Drug use,High School drop out rates,teen pregnancy,failing buisnesses,unemployment,declining real estate values,Etc.<br>
 When will we start getting tired of it enough to say no to it ?</p>

			<p>I love Boulder, wonderful place, mostly because it&rsquo;s WHITE. (civil, clean, ecologically aware, artistic&hellip;..)<br>
I spent a lot of time in Colorado.These kids are naive, they have no idea what it&rsquo;s like to live around blacks and mexicans.I&rsquo;d like to say I hope they never do, but I&rsquo;m sure reality will catch up to them eventually.<br>

<p>Their not naive, they not live around blacks and mexicans because they watch movies and t.v. I went to an all white elementary school and ever now and then the teachers would remind us not go into areas that predominately minorty.</p>
<p>Like you said,Steve,if these kids had to live around blacks,they would soon feel differently.<br>

<p>I lived around blacks in my high school years I dont have any animosity towards them or feel they are bad people. Although I dont think they should name a school after him thougH, because if America fails I think we will regret it. </p>

			<p>I am opposed to naming anything that taxpayers funded after an individual on principle, but if you are, at least wait until the person has been dead for about 50 years.</p>

<p>So were you up in arms when stuff was named after Kennedy, Reagan, Carter, J Edar Hoover, Jimmy Carter or anyone else. I dont think so.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And as far as BHO and MLK are concerned, MLK wanted his people to be recognized by the content of their character, not the color of there skin.</p>

<p>Not really.  He is thought to have believed that by some whites because he once said it (in his &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech).  Since when to public personages sincerely believe something, just because they once said it?  The evidence of King&rsquo;s subsequent political advocacy indicate that he just wanted a racial spoils system.  Which in fact is what we got.</p>

			<p>Hold on, my brainwashed self-hating white liberal youngsters&hellip;the man hasn&rsquo;t even been in office for a month yet, okay?  I know you white liberals hate yourselves, all white people, this country, our culture, and like to arrogantly and smugly and self-rightously show how much you&rsquo;re &#8220;not a racist!&#8221; at the expense of others, but let&rsquo;s wait until he&rsquo;s at least served a term before you break out the cyanide-laced kool-aid..excuse me.  I meant champagne.</p>

<p>America needs a ruthless dictator, A WHITE ONE!!!</p>

			<p>This reminds me of Obama winning two grammies for &#8220;Best Spoken Word&#8221; in 2006 and 2008.<br>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Spoken_Word_Album#2000s" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Spoken_Word_Album#2000s</a></p>
<p>Looking at the past winners in this very liberal, pro-black,  anti right-wing category over the last decade at least. Obama is the only &#8216;pre&rsquo; presidential candidate to win. Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton.<br>
Hollywood liberal all the way. And when you&rsquo;re black you get the accolades before you do anything.<br>

			<p>Question diversity, you certainly nailed it when you wrote,&#8221;&hellip;so it attracted white liberals fleeing California and the problems &#8220;they&#8221;(quotes mine)created.&#8221;</p>
<p>These so called &#8220;liberal progressives&#8221; go from city to city, and State to State, unimpeded, and visit their cultural destruction on traditinal America everywhere they go. </p>

			<p>I grew up in Boulder, and graduated from BHS in 1982.<br>
I personally witnessed the fall of Boulder.<br>
In 1980, we would have beat that kid for daring to suggest changing our school&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>RIP my beloved home town.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As always, our greatest ideological struggle is against many of our fellow Whites who are weak-minded&#8221;. </p>
<p>posted by Anonymous</p>
<p>Very well put. I myself, on an almost daily basis, encounter whites who mistreat or even abuse me (as well as other whites in general), at every opportunity. And this can be very disheartening and spirtually depressing. </p>
<p>Sometimes i think, we whites, are our own worst enemy. </p>

			<p>This shows how unbelievably immature and naïve America is today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unthinkable that this is considered appropriate 3 weeks into a presidency. </p>

			<p>Memphomaniac, you are dead right.  Naming ships after these slugs is disgusting.  Real naval heroes are lucky to get a destroyer named after them.  If a US aircraft carrier is sunk, I hope it&rsquo;s the USS Carl Vinson, named after the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, or some such thing.  Isn&rsquo;t there also one named after John Stennis, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee?  Once, carriers were named after great battles or distinguished historic ships.  Lexington, Yorktown, Enterprise, and Constitution.  Now we honor timeservers and functionaries.  The admirals are simply whoring themselves for bigger budgets.  </p>
