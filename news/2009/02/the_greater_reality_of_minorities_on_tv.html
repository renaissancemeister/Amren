<p>Despite decades of public pressure on the major networks to diversify, the lead characters in all but a few of prime-time scripted shows this season are still white  &mdash;  and usually young and affluent. In contrast, reality programs consistently feature a much broader range of people when it comes to race, age, class and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>For example, CBS&rsquo; &#8220;The Amazing Race&#8221; includes an Asian American brother-and-sister team and two African American sisters in its 14th season, which premiered Sunday. Three African Americans are in the current cast of CBS&rsquo; &#8220;Survivor.&#8221; Four African Americans and two Tongan Americans have been featured on the current season of NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;The Biggest Loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>By contrast, a report released last year by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, titled &#8220;Out of Focus  &mdash;  Out of Sync,&#8221; accused the networks of perpetuating a view of the nation that recalls &#8220;America&rsquo;s segregated past.&#8221; The 40-page report charged that non-whites are underrepresented in almost every aspect of the television industry  &mdash;  except for reality programming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no accident, according to reality TV producers and creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re looking to create shows that everyday people can relate to, and for that you really need a true representation of the population,&#8221; said Dave Broome, executive producer of NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;The Biggest Loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of seasons ago, there was an over-the-top character who was white that we could have cast, but we sacrificed that for a Latino. That&rsquo;s how important that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The culture mix is driven by more than just political correctness. Although reality shows aren&rsquo;t directly in the business of bringing racial and ethnic enlightenment to America, they are in business. For shows that thrive on conflict and drama, a collection of cast members from varied backgrounds often serves that goal. Unresolved issues surrounding race, class and sexual orientation can either quietly fuel tension on programs or generate outright emotional explosions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though the issue of race is often secondary to unscripted series&rsquo; story lines, it does at times directly fuel the drama. William &#8220;Mega&#8221; Collins, an outspoken African American houseguest on the first edition of CBS&rsquo; &#8220;Big Brother,&#8221; was the first evicted from the show after he angrily confronted his predominantly white fellow participants about race. CBS&rsquo; &#8220;Survivor&#8221; in 2006 sparked a furor when the series initially divided tribes along racial and ethnic lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority contestants have often done well in competition shows, such as ABC&rsquo;s &#8220;Dancing With the Stars&#8221; and Fox&rsquo;s &#8220;Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen.&#8221; By winning week after week, these contestants in effect become some of the programs&rsquo; leading characters.</p>
<p>(Two notable exceptions in which a reality program has yet to spotlight a person of color are ABC&rsquo;s dating franchise shows &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and &#8220;The Bachelorette.&#8221; In 17 total seasons, neither show&rsquo;s main role has ever been filled with a person of color. ABC representatives say they are &#8220;exploring&#8221; the issue for upcoming seasons.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s seldom the case with scripted comedies and dramas. Though the major networks  &mdash;  ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC  &mdash;  have in recent years made noticeable strides in assembling multicultural casts in ensemble shows such as &#8220;Heroes,&#8221; &#8220;ER,&#8221; &#8220;Lost&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy,&#8221; there are still only five network shows with a minority actor playing a clear central character: {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;re casting for an unscripted show, it&rsquo;s a much bigger universe and a whole different talent base,&#8221; said Nina Tassler, president of CBS Entertainment. &#8220;It&rsquo;s real people versus actors.</p>

								<h2>O.C. Immigration Groups to Clash Over Reality TV Show</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Cindy Carcamo, Orange County Register, February 13, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Orange County residents on both sides of the illegal immigration debate will square off in front of ABC Disney studios in Burbank on Sunday, one group in protest and another in support of the network&rsquo;s television program &#8220;Homeland Security USA.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reality TV show has sparked a torrent of both disdain and cheers in immigration Web chat rooms and the blogosphere, setting off petitions and e-mails in protest and support for the show, which first aired in January</p>
<p>A few hundred people are expected to show up at Sunday&rsquo;s rallies. The Southern California Immigration Coalition, an immigrant-rights group, is scheduled to protest across from counterprotesters organized by Save Our State, an anti-illegal immigration organization.</p>
<p>The show gives a glimpse at the daily work life of federal workers, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who are responsible for protecting the nation&rsquo;s ports. They are portrayed as heroes who encounter and turn away or apprehend a variety of suspected culprits  &mdash;  from a Swiss woman looking to belly dance in the U.S. to suspected drug smugglers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics of the show, however, have called the series government propaganda, saying that it only portrays one side of a complex and controversial issue, especially regarding illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Series executive producer Arnold Shapiro has said that the show does not have a political point of view, according to an Associated Press story in December.<br>

			<p>What this article really says is that a &#8220;reality show&#8221; (inasmuch as one of them has any reality) tends to expose the weaknesses of blacks, that can be covered up in fictional sitcoms and dramas.</p>

			<p>I wish that writers would stop citing the &#8220;groundbreaking&#8221; season of Survivor where the teams were split along racial lines. I&rsquo;m a big Survivor fan myself, but that was nothing but a cheap publicity stunt. The &#8220;experiment&#8221; lasted a whole two episodes before they desegregated the teams, shuffling everybody up. </p>
<p>And what happened during those first two episodes, before the producers decided that they had done enough experimenting? The White and Asian teams had pulled significantly ahead of the Black and Hispanic teams, sweeping the episode challenges. </p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;Survivor&rdquo; in 2006 sparked a furor when the series initially divided tribes along racial and ethnic lines.</i></p>
<p>I remember that. Within the first ten minutes of the first episode, the blacks were complaining that it wasn&rsquo;t fair because it was too hard for them to compete with other races. In other words, they were used to always being mixed in with other racial groups so they could hide their basic incompetence and laziness.</p>

			<p>For years, blacks and hispanics have been well-represented in the reality show &#8220;COPS.&#8221;  It just depends what type of &#8220;reality&#8221; is being filmed.</p>

I don&rsquo;t make time to watch any particular program. I turn to tv to get a broad view of topics on the national agenda which mirror on-line content. Everyone seems to be on the same page in regards to issues. Only the definition of problem and solution differ.</p>
<p>When it first started, I used to plan my Thursday to watch Survivor. Out of all the reality programs which have turned out to be scripted, Survivor had an air of unmanipulated reality; people were clawing and scheming their way to the top. And on the first few seasons, the casts were overwhelmingly white. It was refreshing to watch white groups and individuals fight it out.</p>
<p>However, Survivor has succumb to the pressure of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;inclusion&rsquo; and that has changed the focus.</p>
<p>Many of the black players talk openly about &#8216;representing&rsquo; blacks and express a keen sense of racial consciousness that whites don&rsquo;t express. Blacks, asians, and hispanics all speak of themselves as distinct groups and as individuals out to prove something for their racial group. As in the larger world, in the world of Survivor, blacks see themselves as black but whites fail to see their racial identity and fail to form racial groups.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t set time to watch Survivor much anymore but when I do, I&rsquo;m always treated to a racially aware minority speaking in term of racial consciousness. Blacks, asians, and hispanics all know what the big picture is. Whites are clueless or at least feign ignorance of race as an issue.<br>

<p>And all of this unequivocally reveals the constant turmoil of multiracial societies.  The bickering and squabbling never stop, because no matter how much we&rsquo;re bombarded with brainwashing and mind control regarding race, ethnicity and the like, trying to effect a particular mindset in people, it doesn&rsquo;t work on non-whites.  They&rsquo;re just too cliquish and will never change.  Race, ethnicity and national origen will ALWAYS be first with them.</p>
<p>Only mind-numbed whites fall in line and at least mouth the nonsense they&rsquo;re programmed with and are intimidated into cowardly submission.  </p>
<p>Multiculturalism will collapse from the weight of it&rsquo;s own stupidity, even if this economic freight train doesn&rsquo;t destroy the concept.</p>

			<p>Not enough minorities on TV? Dont make me laugh. Just abouit every show on network shows blacks or other minorities lecturing whites about just about everything.  Not to mention the disgusting commercials like the vulgar credit card piece with the white barbarians. I have no doubt that blacks would not be depicted as African tribespeople in the modern world. I wrote the company and complained.</p>

<p>Laughing Out Loud, In Utter Abject Disgust!</p>
<p>So what does the perversity of diversity do for a society as a whole, regardless if you call it &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; or Balkanization, but &#8220;quietly fuel tension&#8221; or &#8220;generate outright emotional explosions?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again, the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; ones&rsquo; own words betray them!</p>
<p>Or put another way, if I were in the &#8220;business&#8221; of building and running a country, diversity in: race, class, and sexual orientation, would not be that which I deified. </p>
<p>Quite the contrary, to be exact!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>BTW if you&rsquo;re ever in search of a &#8220;whites only&#8221; station, Turner Classic Movies comes very close. </p>

			<p>Interesting observation, I think. Blacks certainly prefer television shows that exclusively depict their own race. &#8220;Black folk&#8221;, as it were. Tyler Perry feels no obligation to represent life outside of black homes, black neighborhoods, and black culture. The Cosby show rarely portrayed Whites as anything other than buffoonish, un-hip irritations. Why is it that blacks demand their own shows, which exclusively cater to their image, likeness, and interests, AND insist upon being unrealistically portrayed on shows about Whites?</p>
<p>I would really enjoy an explanation from a Marxist troll or one of our African monitors. I have no problem with BET, no problem if Cosby wants to pretend that all black people live in stable two-parent homes and that all blacks are medical professionals who have White cleaning ladies. Somehow, blacks have the ability to become enraged about stories that don&rsquo;t concern them. It seems to me that the only thought an African has upon reading Hamlet is &#8220;Hey! There aren&rsquo;t any black people in this story!&#8221;</p>

			<p>There are 40 million blacks in the USA (13.4%), out of a total population of 300 million people (2006).</p>
<p>I am certainly willing to share this great country, and will even fudge a little bit and say they can have one part in seven (14.2%)&hellip;.but no more.</p>
<p>This would mean&hellip;.<br>
For every seven basketball players in the NBA, one can be black. For every seven football players in the SEC, one can be black. For every seven songs on the radio, one can be by a black musician. For every seven Cadillacs, one can be reserved for a black customer. For every seven homes, one we will save for a black buyer. Same with public housing. For every seven units, one can be occupied by a black family. Do the same for prison, for every seven inmates, only one can be black. (The rest will stay in the black neighborhood and terrorize/victimize their neighbors.) </p>
<p>I think you get the idea. Quotas are a two-edged sword.<br>

			<p>Once again, I wonder what planet the author of these kinds of articles is writing from. I&rsquo;d come to believe through personal observation that there was some kind of federal law mandating that anytime four or more individuals appear similtaneously on a TV screen, one of them HAS to be black. It certainly works that way in advertising on the medium.</p>

			<p>Some of the top soap operas (daytime TV) are way down in ratings, even getting rid of top stars who have anchored the shows.  More and more latinos, blacks and whatevers are filling it up and whites are shutting off their television sets. </p>

			<p>I think the greatest moments in so-called &#8220;Reality TV&#8221; were the Donald Trump show in which the black contestant Omarosa showed us what Blacks really think about the work ethic of Blacks and the Survivor episode where the Chinese engineer gave the Black male contestant a car with the expectation that the Black man might give him the Immunity Idol; the Black Man showed his true colors when he failed to give the Chinese guy the Idol and as a result was voted off the island.</p>

<p>I certainly do, but sometimes blacks and other non-whites are almost unavoidable on my television screen. That&rsquo;s why i don&rsquo;t really watch much TV anymore. I also try to avoid doing business with companies whose TV and print adverts are obsessed with portraying diversity as the greatest thing since buttered bread. Some of those companies and products include Home Depot, Bank of America, Campbell&rsquo;s soup, Orea cookies, Splenda artificial sweetner, Allstate insurance, Target, State Farm insurance, listerine mouth wash, Best Buy&hellip; Perhaps someone else can add some more company and product names whose ads are a diversity mongerer&rsquo;s delight. I&rsquo;ll try to ad them to my &#8216;avoidance&rsquo; list.</p>

That&rsquo;s how important that is!&#8221; Well isn&rsquo;t it nice that &#8220;MR&#8221; Dave Broome thinks it&rsquo;s &#8220;important&#8221; to &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; a White person for a Latino. Well why doesn&rsquo;t he lead by example! Come on Dave what do ya say- - You &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; YOUR job for a nice Latino! You show us just how REALLY important diversity is to YOU!

			<p>What television programs are these people viewing exactly? Unless you stumble upon a hockey game, old black and white film, or perhaps a Jane Austin period flick, you cannot watch TV for two minutes - commercials and all - without seeing blacks in number. Indeed, the over-representation of Blacks on TV and in film is as overwhelming as it is obvious, &#8220;reality&#8221; shows or not! These people are delusional.   </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d watch it, even though I have never watched any reality show, not even once ..partly because it seems trashy. People w/ too much time on their hands. I could never relate.</p>

<p>All they do is preach black solidarity.But according to<br>
the politically correct Commissars, that isn&rsquo;t racist if<br>
blacks do it. It is only the greatest of horrors if Whites<br>
do, and had a WET to boot. Yeah, I watch it occaisionally to <br>
see what they&rsquo;re up to. It was the stuff of a comedy and a <br>
horror movie during the Inaguration. Stuttering &#8220;News&#8221; <br>
anchors and blacks thinking they now rule the cosmos.</p>

			<p>The worse is a Miller commercial where a fat black guy, talking in heavy Ebnomics, invades some area to take back the Miller Beer, because the white people are acting too white. I cannot think of a worse way to present your product. <br>
   Since these commercials started, I stopped drinking Miller beer. </p>

			<p>I am getting rid of my cable TV, because it&rsquo;s a waste of time and money.  I just have basic, so no Turner Classic Movies, which I also gave up because I am not willing to pay the rip off prices, and with commercials, too!  Why are we paying to watch commercials?</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the reasons why I don&rsquo;t watch TV anymore is because every channel you turn to has something about Black History month.  I want to puke every time I have to listen to the smarmy, groveling that goes on about how great blacks are.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if everyone gave up their TV? </p>
<p>Of course, I have a bunch of DVDs that I watch, and I occasionally will rent a movie.  But even the movies coming out these days are trash.  I like watching anything that portrays Whites as dignified heroes - Master and Commander, the Bourne movies, period pieces in which there are no blacks.  </p>
<p>Speaking of which, if anyone watches PBS Masterpiece Theatre, has anyone noticed that they are re-making all of the old Classics that are perfectly good and making them overly sexual, unrealistic historically, and with basically annoying characters that have none of the redeeming features of the originals from the actual books.  The latest one is Oliver Twist, in which they have placed a black actress as Nancy.  At least that&rsquo;s fitting, as she&rsquo;s a prostitute.  But really, were Black women living with Whites as equals in Victorian England?  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the show ( I rarely watch TV at all) but what about &#8220;Survivor: Detroit&#8221; or &#8220;Survivor: Juarez, Mexico.&#8221;  Let&rsquo;s showcase other ethnic groups in their natural habitat. How about an unscripted, unedited reality show where a white kid tries to make it in a predominately black school.  If he graduates (and lives) he gets a million dollars.  </p>

			<p>All they do is preach black solidarity.But according to<br>
the politically correct Commissars, that isn&rsquo;t racist if<br>
blacks do it. It is only the greatest of horrors if Whites<br>
do, and had a WET to boot. Yeah, I watch it occaisionally to <br>
see what they&rsquo;re up to. It was the stuff of a comedy and a <br>
horror movie during the Inaguration. Stuttering &ldquo;News&rdquo; <br>
anchors and blacks thinking they now rule the cosmos.</p>

<p>Are you out of your mind, it doesnt do that. It generally perpetuates black sterotypes. Girls dressed as sluts shaking their butts, black males speaking ignorant, rap videos that perpetuate sterotypes. Most of the movies involve ignorant blacks killing each other. Most blacks on BET can barely speak proper ENGLISH and they are simply killing each other. Every sterotype of blacks imagenable is shown in full force on BET and any other black tv stations. Every now and then they will show someone in a positive manner. Their comedy shows do nothing but insult the black way of life in AMERICA and in AFRICA.</p>
<p>Do you even watch that t.v. channel or do just make statements on a whim.</p>

			<p>Try watching TV without the sound. The indoctrination is overwhelmingly transparent. Better yet, turn off TV and take a stroll through your inner city. Now that&rsquo;s what I call entertainment, if you survive!</p>

			<p>The shows that truly show blacks as they are, is COPS, America&rsquo;s Most Wanted, Cold Case Files, Cheaters, Maury and The First 48 Hours.  The rest is pure fiction.</p>

			<p>I see minorities all the time on TV.</p>
<p>They are usually</p>
<p>* Judges in courtroom<br>
* Black cops tracking down white criminals<br>
* Doctors saving the lives of white patients</p>
<p>But my favorite is the sacrosanct black family (with the ever present smiling, benevolent father) on commercials. I feel like I have to genuflect everytime these faultless black people appear on screen.<br>

			<p>On the one hand, it is good for whites to become conscious that they are just 10 percent of the global population.  Not seeing white faces in the pantheon of TV stars might wake them up to their minority status.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whites may become complacent and resigned to being a minority, when they can say: this does not hurt so much&hellip;</p>

			<p>What gets me are all those CSI crime shows where they always seem to have some &#8220;brilliant&#8221; black scientist solving the crime, which of course in Hollywood, is always committed by a White. Probably the exact reveral of real life. </p>

			<p>&#8220;How many white folks, like me, change the channel as soon as they see a black face? Enough to make a difference? I suspect not, but even so it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d really like to know.</p>
<p>BTW if you&rsquo;re ever in search of a &ldquo;whites only&rdquo; station, Turner Classic Movies comes very close. &#8220;</p>

<p>&gt; Great question; When I view I always click past the Black faces and they really do dominate nearly all networks.  It has been very difficult to not click past presidential events lately, although I know I need the information, but it was easy to miss the entire inaugaration ceremony and other social events - as I always have done - although these last ones were the most obnoxious in American history.  I pass by the reality shows instantly, although I have occassionally noticed really poor integrity/values of its characters.  I stopped watching CSI and the other one when I noticed the preponderence of White perpetrators and non-White prosecutors/law enforcement.  In that case, I have concluded that the producers fear to show the reality of crime, but wish to continue to dumb down Whites to that reality through their programs.  </p>
<p>When I watch TV, it is mostly for news.  I sample all views and arguments.  I watch The McLaughlin Group on PBS because I like to listen to political debate and draw my own conclusions.  I sometimes watch the History Channel to hear the latest mispronunciations of names, places and other historical ommissions/mistakes they make by the semi-literates that produce those shows.  I like the Great Planes shows and some of the military channel shows.  Aside from that, I watch TCM and love the old movies where one might get a reminder of how beautiful a people we once were and how wonderful a nation we once were.  TCM almost always makes me sad, too.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s another of those White Folks who boycott a great deal of television to add to the list.  Judging by the scramble for ratings, we have a lot of company.<br>

			<p>For years, blacks and hispanics have been well-represented in the reality show &ldquo;COPS.&rdquo; It just depends what type of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; is being filmed.</p>
<p>Posted by Kevin at 7:11 PM on February 17</p>
<p><br>
Yes, that&rsquo;s so spot on! I remember watching the show enthusiastically for the first time many years ago from my own country&rsquo;s TV channel. It seems the show gives quite an uncensored image of the life in the &#8216;inner cities&rsquo;. Not much politically correct distortion there. </p>
<p>At the time I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it, but there was some obvious disprepancy in the racial composition of the suspects vs. rest of the population. At least a third were Black, another third Hispanic, and the rest White. For some strange twist of coincidence, almost NONE of the suspects were ever Asian. Gives you a sense of the &#8216;enrichment&rsquo; posed by multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>As far as the TV show &#8220;Homeland Security USA,&#8221; I have watched every episode so far, and all it is is a like &#8220;COPS&#8221; but focusing on ICE/CBP.  In my opinion, &#8220;HLS USA&#8221; whitewashes the immigration situation, by promulgating the notion that the immigration authorities (both CBP and ICE) always catch their man, always catch every prohibited person and contraband item that comes into the country, and that there are really very few illegal crossings and entries and residence because of their diligent work.</p>
<p>We know the reality is far different.</p>
<p>I think this is ABC&rsquo;s attempt to make white right-wingers think the immigration issue is far more under control than it is.  The open borders left should be happy with this show.</p>

			<p> rational thinker, I said they promote black solidarity. I<br>
didn&rsquo;t say a thing about them doing It in a positive light.</p>
<p> Besides the majority of black america must approve of BET&rsquo;s<br>
message. If not, I doubt it would be on the air. Also the<br>
same with rap videos, black movies and sitcoms. Perhaps you<br>
should enlighten fellow blacks to the pitfalls of BET.</p>

<p>Beautifully said.I love those old movies,too;and I feel that same sense of sadness when I&rsquo;m watchng TCM. Besides TCM, there isn&rsquo;t much I watch on television anymore. I&rsquo;ve been relying on dvds more and more for my home entertainment.</p>
<p>I used to be sort of a cable news junkie;but now I can hardly stand to watch CNN  &mdash;  they are so obviously biased in their reporting.And Fox News has always been a joke.I get my news now from the internet, especially AMREN. </p>
