<h1><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/portal/breakingnews/ci_11726150?_loopback=1">Mullen Students Given Empathy Lesson</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Overland High School administrators told a group of Mullen High School students Tuesday about the impact that racially tinged remarks they hurled at a basketball game had on the black Overland players.</p>
<p>After the meeting at Mullen, principals for the two schools said they believe the students now realize how insensitive and hurtful the remarks were.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group of about 37 Mullen students will write apologies to the Overland team and may meet with them sometime in the future. Not all of the students engaged in the harassment, but none tried to stop it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Overland personnel said Mullen students come across as arrogant, said Mullen principal Greg Gotchey. Overland is an Aurora public high school with a student body that is 38 percent African-American, 34 percent white and 22 percent Latino. Mullen is a private Catholic school. The student body is 75 percent white, 3.9 percent black and 11.3 percent Latino.</p>
<p>The Mullen students chanted &#8220;Buckwheat&#8221; and other terms in unison as African-American Overland students stepped to the foul line during last Wednesday&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The kids chanting &#8220;Buckwheat&#8221; were referring to the hairstyle of one of the Overland players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their intention was to poke fun at somebody&rsquo;s hairstyle to get them off of their game,&#8221; Gotchey said.</p>
<p>The player wore a hairstyle similar to that worn by a black child character in the &#8220;Little Rascals&#8221; comedies of the 1930s and &rsquo;40s.</p>
<p>The Buckwheat character is widely considered a demeaning racial stereotype.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he said he thought the schools were handling it well by using the incident to teach students about racial intolerance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Borgmann [Bert Borgmann, assistant commissioner of the Colorado High School Activities Association] said Gotchey missed a chance to teach the teens that their behavior was inappropriate by not making them leave the game.</p>

			<p>I saw the video the white kids got roughed up pretty well. I know they&rsquo;ll think twice next time  before behaving foolishly. Seeing that the supposed offenders come from a lily white school and it can be assumed a lily white community also they are unaware of typical tribal black behavior. These are probably the same white kids who listen to rap music  and wear hip hop gear on the weekends. </p>

Overland is an Aurora public high school with a student body that is 38 percent African-American, 34 percent white and 22 percent Latino.</p>
<p>Wow!!!! How could whites be in a school where they&rsquo;re the minority. The only schools I know that are like this are inner city magnet schools that students  must test into or suburban schools that are in the early stages of white flight.</p>

<p>If my kid did not do it, there is no way he/she would be writing an apology for anything or meeting with anyone. So, basically they are teaching these kids that they are responsible for other people&rsquo;s behavior. Blacks teach their kids irresponsibility via &#8220;Stop Snitching&#8221; and whites make their kids responsible for others behavior. </p>

			<p> Little do they know, the more they preach, the less<br>
anyone cares. This gets so repetitive and old. They<br>
were having a bit of adolescent fun. Then as usual<br>
the Libtards have to make a race issue out of it. <br>

			<p>I like the old &#8220;Our Gang&#8221; serials.  Buckwheat was funny.  They were ahead of their time.  How many modern &#8220;gangs&#8221; are interracial?</p>
<p>As we all know if blacks had hurled racial insults at Whites, or even assaulted some, it would still be Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p> Oh, the poor, poor African-American students! Their feelings were hurt! Maybe the best defense students from that school could have mounted was to come up with some mocking chants directed at the White kids who were doing the chanting. Gee, why didn&rsquo;t anyone think of that?</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t these knuckleheaded school administrators realize that calling in one set of students for lectures about things said in the heat of competition about another set of students simply breeds resentment against the students who seem to be getting &#8220;special protection&#8221; against the robust debate we all should expect to face occasionally as we grow and (hopefully) mature into adulthood?</p>

<p>Assigning them to read &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; would help them a lot more to learn about racial intolerance, especially the part that describes that 37,500 black on white rapes occur every year and hardly any at all the other way around.</p>

			<p>The association is right.  These are serious crimes.  Why if action is not taken these White students may grow up to be murderers, rapists, tax cheats, etc.</p>

			<p> An indication of where political correctness is heading is the sentence: &#8220;Not all of the students engaged in the harassment, but none tried to stop it.&#8221; It is no longer enough merely to be politically correct - you are now guilty if you do not help enforce political correctness.<br>

<p>Since when is it students&rsquo; job to &#8220;stop&#8221; something/anything? They make it sound as though the kids stood around and let a murder happen, and even then I wouldn&rsquo;t have blamed anyone for not coming to the rescue. Why be a dead &#8220;hero&#8221;? This entire incident is stupid and I just wish the students in question would simply tell their apologists to go stick it!<br>

			<p>Note: Mullen is a private Catholic H.S. That means that parents of the White students are paying big money for their children&rsquo;s tuition (in addition to school taxes). The student&rsquo;s probably get better educational opportunities than at a public school, but they get the same massive injection of White guilt as they would get in Public schooling. </p>

<p>Then why is a black kid wearing his hair that way?  Sounds like he was inviting the comparison.</p>

			<p>And at other times whites are insulted, not in fun, and even assaulted and sometimes killed. No apologies are made. They&rsquo;d prefer no one know about it at all, outside the victim. Then they&rsquo;d prefer we not discuss it among ourselves (intolerance) in the hopes we don&rsquo;t bring up our real experiences. They are willing to use force and coercion to achieve these goals, and not just out and out lies or lies of ommission. </p>

			<p>Are the Black students being required to write &#8220;apology letters&#8221; to the students they injured with their violent reaction?</p>
<p>How ludicrous is this?  I call you a name, you punch me in the face, and I&rsquo;m the one who has to apologize?</p>

			<p>Also in the paper here (Denver) it was reported the word <br>
&#8220;marshmallow&#8221; and the equally terrible insult &#8220;shrimp boat&#8221;<br>
was hurled. Shrimp boat sent the blacks into a spasm of hurt feelings? Oh my. Wonder what the next word or words they will decide are unusable for Whites.</p>

			<p>Let me get this straight, some students yell out &#8220;Buckwheat&#8221; and get assaulted for it and they must apologize to those that did them bodily harm?  Liberalism is a disease of the mind that has reached epidemic proportions. The only &#8220;intolerance &#8221; I see here is that of the school administration and the blacks that started the fighting.  While yelling &#8220;Buckwheat&#8221; may have been in bad taste, assault is a criminal matter and I see no arrests or charges filed against the Overland team. It is indeed troubled times when people can get beat for saying a simple word and the school administration and local law enforcement has no problem with that.          </p>

<p>I see this happening recently: Punishment by Essay.  My guess is no one will read those silly essays, which means the students could probably write whatever they want. </p>
<p>If someone tried to punish me this way&hellip; the stuff I would write.  &#8220;The white folks of the world apologize for bringing civilization to blacks who were living in the stone-age, for giving them brick houses, medicine, plumbing, literacy, the rule of law&hellip;.&#8221;  Actually there&rsquo;s a nice essay on this topic already but I couldn&rsquo;t locate it.</p>

			<p>To Question Diversity @5:54:</p>
<p>thanks for the link.  Looks like just another typical day in da hood.  Maybe we should send it to Eric Holder to remind him why Saturdays and Sundays are still so darn segregated! </p>
<p> As for me and my white family, we will continue to steer clear of predominently black sporting events (and any other event where we&rsquo;d be in the minority).</p>

			<p>If I were black I would be embarrassed and ashamed that I needed Special Hep to compete with other races. Even now years later without Special Hep they don&rsquo;t seem to do that well. Well at least they can thank the powers above that the Government has an never ending supply of well paying jobs for college graduates who can barely read?</p>
