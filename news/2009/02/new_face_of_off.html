<h1>New Face of Offender in Federal Courts Is Hispanic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Gamboa, AP, February 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics outnumber other ethnic groups among criminal offenders in the federal courts due in part to the crackdown on illegal immigration, according to a study released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic Center, which analyzed federal sentencing data, found that in 2007, 40 percent of the offenders were Hispanic, compared with 27 percent white, 23 percent black and 10 percent from other groups. In 1991, whites comprised 43 percent of those sentenced in federal courts and 24 percent were Hispanic.</p>
<p>The Hispanic offenders were more likely to be non-citizens and nearly half of the crimes were immigration-related. Three-quarters of the crimes were for re-entering or remaining in the country illegally, while about a fifth were for smuggling, transporting or harboring an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lopez linked the increase to a 1995 federal program dubbed Operation Gatekeeper, which stopped undocumented immigrants at the border. Also, a 1996 immigration law that designated certain crimes as &#8220;aggravated felonies&#8221; has led to increasing caseloads in federal courts.</p>
<p>Immigration prosecutions have quadrupled since 2001 as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of the Homeland Security Department, has deployed fugitive operations teams to arrest illegal immigrants and those who have committed crimes.</p>
<p>In 2007, 10,824 people were sentenced in federal courts for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data on the most recent numbers available. Of those, about 80 percent received enhanced sentences for prior convictions for other crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The numbers change significantly when Hispanic offenders are separated by citizenship status. Hispanics who are U.S. citizens were only 11 percent of all sentenced federal offenders in 2007 and 8 percent in 1991.</p>

			<p>Even if you take out the immigration offenses, this means that Hispanics are still very much overrepresented among the population of Federal criminal defendants.</p>

			<p>Hispanics are not getting a fair trial in the border states. The juries are overwhelmingly Hispanic (or totally Hispanic) and they refuse to convict fellow Hispanics. These trials need to be moved to another venue&hellip;..maybe Montana or Wyoming, so they can get a fair trial.</p>
<p>This was exactly the same problem the two Border Patrolmen ran into when they were tried by a Hispanic prosecutor, and a totally Hispanic jury. They were not convicted of shooting a drug smuggler, they were convicted of &#8220;turning on their own kind&#8221;, as the prosecutor put it to the jury.</p>

			<p>I notice in our online postings of those arrested each day that Hispanics are classified as WHITE yet when they need a Special Loan or other Special Help they are classified as Hispanic? Why is this?</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t Forget: If you NOTICE a large percentage of those in the lineup are (They Only Come To Work) Hispanic, and make any Reference or Referral to that (fact) in America Today, that is called RACISM </p>

<p>This is an indication of how many illegals there are in the country. The numbers are staggering.</p>

			<p>     Here in Lake County, Florida, we have a half hour program showing our local court system in operation. Many of the defendants are Hispanic and many cannot speak English. I do not believe there is any effort made to determine if these defendants are illegal aliens. Why ?</p>
