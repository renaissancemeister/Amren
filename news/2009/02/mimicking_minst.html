	<p>With his face coated in black paint and his mouth encircled in red lipstick, Omari Daniels harkens back to an often-forgotten and racist practice in American history.</p>
<p>As of late, the black freshman has made his presence known on campus by dressing in blackface for the entirety of Black History Month to spread awareness about the minstrel shows of the 1800s.</p>

			<p>Gee! Another diciple for Jesse and Al. I know if I came back 100 years from now, African-Americans would still be whining about being victims. They should be quiet - who knows, some day they might elect a black President, a black AJ, a black Sec. of State, replace all sports teams with blacks, have the richest black woman in the world with her own TV program and have afirmative action. Naw! that couldn&rsquo;t happen, so keep complaining.</p>

			<p>He is fighting a phantom imgage.  He has to create it because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  Meanwhile, BET and MTV routinely show black rappers and wannabe gangstas, which is far more damaging and negative than a caricature in a minstrel show.</p>

			<p>White people have the right to their perception of other groups. Here we see the current attitude that if something is not completely flattering to blacks then it is racist. If people in the 1800s were entertained by minstrel shows, that&rsquo;s fine with me. If blacks today are upset about it, I do not care. </p>

<p>Then get a job at BET. Be a standup comedian for BET or one of the cable channels if you really must subject people to ugly racism. It&rsquo;s always good to give the people a reminder. How quickly we forget. </p>

			<p> If you want to hear and see a REAL, genuine, black-face minstrel, instead of all the mindless drivel about &#8220;ugly racism,&#8221; ad nauseum, in this article, google &#8220;Emmett Miller,&#8221; also known as &#8220;The Minstrel Man From Dixieland.&#8221; He was a White man from Georgia who sang in minstrel shows through the 1920s and &rsquo;30s, and recorded a number of songs in the late 1920s. His unique talent and singing style, which sounded just like a black &#8220;mammy&#8221; singer, influenced Hank Williams Sr., Leon Redbone, Bob Wills the &#8220;King of Western Swing,&#8221; and a number of other, more modern White performers. YouTube has several brief videos of his singing or of his minstrel performances. </p>

			<p>I have a 100 year-old book on magic that has ads in the back for books on how to conduct and run minstrel shows. The sad fact is, that whites have always had a perverse fascination with blacks. From slavery, to fiction like Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin, to old-time race hustlers like W.E.B. Dubois, to minstrel shows, to &#8220;Amos &#8216;n&rsquo; Andy,&#8221; to the current white fascination with rap music and ghetto culture, to black athletes, even to the current Obamania, whites just can&rsquo;t seem to leave blacks alone. Whites, especially Americans, have always found blacks fascinating, and it&rsquo;s going to lead to their own ultimate demise.</p>

<p>-You should care since they&rsquo;re accusing Whites of being racist when the real reality of the situation is that Blacks are benefiting from reverse racism against Whites in all aspects of life from work to housing.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Day in and day out, Daniels roams campus in this ensemble, half-waiting and half-hoping that someone will question him about his motives and inspirations.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a good laugh.  Sounds like he is miffed because he isn&rsquo;t noticed as much and as he thinks he should be.  No surprise here.  Just one more freak in a sea of freaks. Many may think he is homeless.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Trachtenberg scholarship is awarded annually to a number of students from D.C. who demonstrate academic and extracurricular excellence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the answer as to how this future astrophysicist landed at this school.  Academic and extracurricular excellence?  Yeah, maybe among all the other home boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to embody this ugly form of racism,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People had to endure this ugly racism for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Whereas today people have to endure a DIFFERENT ugly form of racism. The difference is that now the ugly racism is directed entirely at WHITE PEOPLE. </p>
<p>Which, I guess, makes us the new minstrels. </p>

			<p>The fact that Blacks must consistently harken back to events that predate virtually any living human, or at least go back generations, in order to demonstrate how much wicked &#8220;racism&#8221; and oppression they must contend with, speaks volumes for how empty all their accusations really are. Whatever may or may not have happened in the past&hellip;it is in the past! For goodness sake already, move on!!  </p>

			<p>&#8220;He said he has been surprised by how little GW students and community members seem to know about the history of minstrelsy and that the majority of those who do know are black.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the images our country has had to overcome,&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Marisa Kabas, GW Hatchet (George Washington University), February 23, 2009</p>
<p>Let me see if I&rsquo;ve got this straight. We have got to be reminded of things that we forgot or learn about things we never knew so that we can overcome the negative images that we couldn&rsquo;t have had because we didn&rsquo;t know about them.</p>
<p>No. We&rsquo;ve got to learn about things so that we can then have negative images that we will then have to overcome?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. Do you suppose Marisa is black? Oh, now I understand.</p>

Any excuse to wear lipstick.<br>
<i>Minstrel shows reached the height of their popularity in the pre-Civil War era</i> <br>
Does the statute of limitations ever run out on black whining and white guilt? <br>
<i>even plans on doing it annually</i><br>
He needs to get a life.</p>

			<p>Minstrel shows are alive and well in popular culture. You can see shucking and jiving any time you want by rappers on MTV. They look so ridiculous they make me giggle every time. (Imagine writing down the lyrics to a rap song on your resume.) It&rsquo;s too funny the way a twenty-something black male thinks its cool to dress and babble like a toddler, with his sneakers untied, his pants falling down, and his baseball cap turned sideways. Our Gang chic, I suppose. Who would have guessed Stymie and Buckwheat would play such a seminal role in black entertainment history.</p>

Apart from the overt sexual content, I consider many rap videos to be little more than an extension of minstrel performers sans black face.</p>
<p>You see the same shuffling, the same hand gestures all updated with contemporary exaggerated and goofy outfits. The difference now is that blacks &#8216;own it&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>Why do I get the feeling these minstrel shows were using humor to properly &#8216;sensitize&rsquo; whites to the black experience? Just more diversity training.</p>

			<p>    Has this kid ever watched a football game? All the dancing, miming, chest-pounding, and mugging after a black player scores&hellip; Hell, the only things missing are a banjo and white gloves! They will do anything to be the center of attention. And those moronic antics are the reason I have quit watching sports. </p>

			<p>That rap music its lyrics, movements and dress only perpetutate and confirm the low grade of blacks. It does nothing in boosting their stereotype. It only makes me, along with all other intelligent people with morals and a drop of class, form an ugly negative idea of who these black people are. The rare decent black folk should be apalled at what rappers are perpetuating out there in the mainstream world. These white people who &#8220;act&#8221; black and look up to that black gangster role-modeling, what kind of white people are these??? They must be either single mother children, have none to little formal eduaction or socioecolomically on the bottom rungs. I cannot fathom anything else, although I know the unspeakable is happening and is true. <br>
