<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A probationary firefighter who died at a training session was the victim of an FDNY effort to keep blacks out of the department, a lawyer for his widow charged Thursday.</p>
<p>Jamel Sears, who collapsed Nov. 10 at the Fire Academy, died after he was subjected to a more strenuous physical regimen than FDNY hopefuls  &mdash;  most of them white  &mdash;  had undergone in the past, lawyer Ken Thompson said.</p>
<p>Sears&rsquo; widow, Sherita, filed a notice of claim Feb. 6 informing the city and the FDNY she plans to bring a $10 million wrongful death suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the largest class of blacks and Latinos in Fire Department history,&#8221; Thompson said. &#8220;Why did the department decide for the first time to implement this particular training?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re saying we believe there was a racial motivation there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the racial component, the Sears filing claimed an FDNY instructor ordered other trainees not to help Sears as he died before their eyes. It took EMS more than 15 minutes to reach the Fire Academy on Randalls Island, the court papers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Sears&rsquo;s] wife is a city police officer. {snip}</p>

			<p>My first awakening that blacks were lazy despite being more physically stronger came from watching the first series of Survivor.  Two teams had to compete in a relay race.  Everyone on one team said their chances of winning was good because one team member ( a black male ) was a very physically fit coach. All team members started running and continued running, exhausting  themselves even when out of sight from their team members. Well except for the black who was much more fit than the others. As soon as he was out of sight he started walking.  Now after studying black behavior I realize that the Survivor incident was the norm.</p>

The article doesn&rsquo;t make it clear that more strenuous drills were used. This seems to be the claim made by the lawyer.</p>
<p>If more strenuous physical tests were used, were they only required for minorities? If it&rsquo;s true and can be proven, they have a case. If whites and minorities had to undergo the same challenges, then the charge is groundless.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;FDNY instructor ordered other trainees not to help Sears as he died before their eyes.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>These types of deaths are all too common in rigorous physical challenges. There should be better oversight of people who collapse during such drills to see if they&rsquo;re simply exhausted or if they&rsquo;re in life-threatening distress.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, this doesn&rsquo;t pass the smell test. With NYC&rsquo;s commitment to diversity, it seems they would relax the standards so more minorities could pass, not make them more stringent. Could it be they relaxed the medical entrance standards and he wasn&rsquo;t in fact medically qualified to perform the prescribed physical fitness tests?</p>

			<p>What must it be like to go through your whole life in a state of utter paranoia regarding your race? When every incident in life can be attributed to some manner of discrimination, seen or unseen, like some sort of dark-age belief in evil &#8220;spirits&#8221; and demons? I suppose it is convenient in many ways to have this built-in excuse for every misfortune that may befall one. But the neurosis of that constant paranois must also take its toll in various ways. No wonder Blacks are such dysfunctional and often unhealthy people.   </p>

			<p> Of all the preposterous claims I&rsquo;ve ever seen made in a lawsuit, those made here have to be the most nonsensical.</p>
<p> For one thing, if &#8220;more than one-third&#8221; of the recruits were black, Hispanic, Asian or female, that still leaves nearly two thirds White males   &mdash;   unless there&rsquo;s some third category we&rsquo;re not being made aware of. Presumably the White males have to do the same training exercises all the others do   &mdash;   including carrying 100 pounds a given distance in a short period of time. As a matter of fact, if FDNY didn&rsquo;t have that exercise before this year, it certainly should have. I find it hard to believe that the department didn&rsquo;t have the carrying training before; I believe it&rsquo;s SOP in firefighter training, world-wide.</p>
<p> Claiming that a training instructor &#8220;ordered the other recruits not to assist Sears as he died before their eyes&#8221; sounds to me like a stretching of the truth to the breaking point by the wife&rsquo;s lawyer. And besides, is she suggesting that the instructor has the power of life and death over these recruits? If they could have helped him, doesn&rsquo;t she think that some of them at least would have defied the instructor&rsquo;s order and done so? As to the EMTs taking &#8220;more than 15 minutes to reach the Fire Academy on Randalls Island,&#8221; the academy may have been negligent in not having emergency personnel on hand just in case of sudden injury or illness. But wouldn&rsquo;t the White male recruits have been just as vulnerable in their absence as the others?</p>
<p> Sounds to me like Sears&rsquo; wife has hired one dumb lawyer.  </p>

			<p>First, the aptitude tests are too difficult, now the physical tests are discriminatory, too. Black firefighters just can&rsquo;t catch a break. What exactly are on these tests, anyway? In St. Louis, part of the Fire Department aptitude test was leaked. A sample question went something like this: a fire hydrant is 90 feet from a fire. If hoses come in 30 foot sections, how many sections are needed to reach from the hydrant to the fire?  This was not a trick question. The answer was 3 {90 divided by 30 is 3}. I think if the requirements were widely known, these plaintiffs would be laughingstocks. Or maybe this is just wishful thinking.</p>

			<p>My favorite &#8220;Survivor&#8221; episode was the one where this Northeast Asian engineer gave a car he had won to a Black male contestant, in the hope that the Black would give him the &#8220;Immunity Idol&#8221; when he needed it.</p>
<p>When the time came for the Black to return the favor, he chose NOT to give the Idol to the engineer. That one episode totally reflected what Blacks do America.</p>
<p>Contrast that to &#8220;The Amazing Race&#8221; where these Korean guys attempted to keep as many of the contestants in the running.</p>

			<p>It seems that some Blacks and all Liberals will stop at nothing until every single public service is degraded to the lowest common denominator, simply to allow unqualified Minorities in. God help those in Cities who bend to the will of these groups, for their lives truly will be in danger whenever the Fire Department or EMT&rsquo;s are needed.</p>

<p>That is one of many stupid sterotypes that have been passed around in America.

			<p>This is the opening of the final assault on the NYC Fire Dept. It is the last standing institution that drives the elite left (almost all white) totally nuts. This is due to the fact that the Dept remains 90% plus WHITE MALE after campaign after campaign to diversify the Dept has been an utter failure. I believe the answer to this is that WHITE MALES are the ones who are most interested in this job. In NYC police, correction, and transit departments have almost all become multicult and diversity paradises. Just walk down 5th Ave at the height of the Christmas season when the area is flooded with cops and the collection of stumble bums and misfits dressed in police uniforms will astound you.</p>

			<p>I guess if the recruits in New York only have to drag 100 pounds, they are not as strong as the police and fire recruits in Birmingham, who have to drag about 150 pounds for a short distance.  This is to simulate getting a person away from danger.  If you can&rsquo;t do that, then you are out.  I mean fire hoses and people are heavy, and the weak recruits have to be weeded out, because who wants to think the guy supposedly coming to save your life can&rsquo;t even pull you out of a burning building?</p>

			<p>The article did not say the exercises were more stringent for minorities; it only said the exercises were more stringent than in the past.  That sounds like a weak argument for racism, since in each case minorities and whites took the same test.</p>
<p>I know in the past some fire departments had relaxed the physical exercises to a point that they became a joke.  They had lowered the standards so women could pass the test in greater numbers, and they lowered the written tests so more minorities could pass.</p>

<p>As much as I could care less about NASCAR, when we see affirmative action taking hold in NASCAR, expect the death rate to go up as well. Driving fast vs. driving fast with skill are two different concepts. If the laws of nature have anything to say about it, there will be mayhem.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight, working out, staying focused, and having steady diet have nothing to do with being strong. There are plenty of whites who can compete with blacks in many sports so dont tell me about differences. </p>
<p>What are trying to say blacks woke up one morning with muscles, fast speed, and really good at certain sports? Give me a break.</p>

			<p>I guess the woman will get a settlement out of the case, I think that&rsquo;s the way the city handles these things. I don&rsquo;t think these cases go to trial often.</p>
<p>The bigger issue i think is that Sears was 33 yrs old and just going to the academy. It&rsquo;s my opinion that a guy who is that age shouldn&rsquo;t even be in the academy in the first place. He&rsquo;s too old. his best years are behind him. The taxpayer is really getting a beating when a man that age is allowed to try to be a &#8220;firemen.&#8221; I guess with everything being as crazy as things are, you can&rsquo;t even have a reasonable age cutoof. I remember in my Union, it was twenty seven. Anyone older than that isn&rsquo;t going to give the taxpayer his moneys worth. </p>

			<p>Regardless if this was (as they claim) a new training procedure, I fail to see how there was any racial component, or discrimination involved   &mdash;   if EVERYBODY was taking the same test. The  racial percentages are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Procedures and training methods change all the time. That means absolutely NOTHING, if everyone is treated equally.  Some people will always find something to gripe about.  Or to sue about.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I do notice that his wife is a city police officer. She knows the game. I wonder what sort of  &#8220;police work&#8221; she does.</p>

			<p>Victor Gerhard,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I competed with blacks in sports. however, during my extremely physical career, I never saw one who could keep up with White or Red men physically speaking. The thing with our work was it was a combination of physical and mental agility and i think the mental aspect of the work was probably the difference maker. That&rsquo;s why in my work (Structural Ironworker), to this day, there are no black connectors. That work is far out of their reach.</p>

<p>This is coming from somebody who, if given an average physical standards test, would fail miserably.  She has no business being a cop. </p>
<p>Give her an assignment to wrestle an average size guy to the ground and she&rsquo;d get her head whipped badly.  In fact her and another female would get their heads whipped badly.</p>
<p>What she wants out of the FD and the PD is a physical test that favors all blacks and when they can&rsquo;t do the work they&rsquo;re paid to do, she&rsquo;ll be screaming discrimination, because she&rsquo;ll want more people to do what only one or two have always done in the past.</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t had to take anyone on by herself, but when she does and winds up being trounced and humiliated it will all be because the higher ups are racist and didn&rsquo;t provide enough help for her.</p>

			<p>To Rational Thinker,</p>
<p>I can understand your hesitance to believe that blacks have a physiological edge in athletic endeavors. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the focus on their race that makes you uncomfortable. </p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s a very plausible concept. Consider if you will the anatomical differences discovered in the Sherpas, a race of people of Asian descent in the Nepal/Tibet areas. </p>
<p>The Sherpas (as a people) have never lived below an altitude of 12,000 feet. They live and work in the Himalayas, most notably as porters and guides on Mt. Everest. </p>
<p>Modern medicine has discovered that they have larger hearts than other people. Their lungs possess a capacity to extract oxygen from the ambient air (VO2 max) that no other people have. These medical facts explain their awesome power to perform physically at otherwise unsurvivable altitudes without supplemental oxygen.</p>
<p>Also consider similar medical discoveries made about Polynesian pearl divers. They can obtain and hold incredible depths while free-diving in the open ocean, at a point where other divers would exhaust their lung capacity and/or suffer &#8220;the bends.&#8221; </p>
<p>Closer to home, look at Lance Armstrong. Dozens of medical tests (and plenty of doping accusations) have simply confirmed that his lungs are literally larger than the average person&rsquo;s. He can deliver more oxygen to his working muscles than anyone else under identical athletic demands. </p>
<p>Plenty of professional literature in the field of sports physiology has confirmed over the years that great sprinters are great sprinters because of a genetic predisposition to fast-twitch muscle fibers. Similarily, great marathoners have a more abundant supply of slow-twitch muscle fibers. </p>
<p>The medical groundwork has, in my opinion, been laid. I certainly find it plausible that certain physiological differences could exist that make blacks better prepared for athletic competition. </p>
<p>I hope this information gives more credence to what you might think is simply a racial sterotype. </p>

			<p>This incident is eerily reminiscent of a tragic event that occurred some years ago in Baltimore City. A black female firefighter trainee died in a training fire set in an abandoned row home. </p>
<p>Several federal investigations determined that a number of safety regulations had been violated during the fire. However, the fire department&rsquo;s own records revealed that the trainee had been &#8220;passed&#8221; on certain physical fitness tests when she actually lacked the required physical ability. When danger showed itself, many professionals believe her unprepared body &#8220;red-lined&#8221; and she was unable to physically lift herself through a window to escape. </p>
<p>I think this FDNY recruit&rsquo;s death is a tragedy. However, training deaths do occur - public service is a life-and-death profession and those brave souls entrusted to protect us should indeed be trained in as near to real circumstances as possible. </p>
<p>Perhaps the real tragedy might be a matter of &#8220;PC&#8221; over professional aptitude. I find it completely believable that a physically unfit minority candidate, kept in place solely due to his race, was then subjected to demanding training that his body simply wasn&rsquo;t ready for. A blind adherence to foolish (and technically unlawful) racial preference may have cost this young man his life. </p>
