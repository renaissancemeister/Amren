			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ralph Z. Hallow, Washington Times, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newly elected Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele plans an &#8220;off the hook&#8221; public relations offensive to attract younger voters, especially blacks and Hispanics, by applying the party&rsquo;s principles to &#8220;urban-suburban hip-hop settings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The RNC&rsquo;s first black chairman will &#8220;surprise everyone&#8221; when updating the party&rsquo;s image using the Internet and advertisements on radio, on television and in print, he told The Washington Times.</p>
<p>Having been elected to the job that the Bush White House and its political guru, Karl Rove, once denied him, Mr. Steele is running the show his way. To those who claimed he can&rsquo;t make the trains run on time, he has this message: &#8220;Stuff it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stiff-armed an attempt to get him to elaborate on his public relations effort, saying he would be an idiot to give his opponents too much information, but indicated the Republican Party needs to break out of being considered a regional party.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was underlying concerns we had become too regionalized and the party needed to reach beyond our comfort&#8221; zones, he said, citing defeats in such states as Virginia and North Carolina. &#8220;We need messengers to really capture that region   &mdash;   young, Hispanic, black, a cross section &hellip; We want to convey that the modern-day GOP looks like the conservative party that stands on principles. But we want to apply them to urban-surburban hip-hop settings.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We missed the mark in the past, which is why we are in the crapper now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had the White House, the Senate and the House and were not building a farm team over the last years. We could have been ahead of Democrats and their 50-state strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Top party officials and officeholders have suggested that Mr. Steele name as deputy chairman someone who can run the national committee&rsquo;s vast operations in fundraising, communications, candidate recruitment and training, and voter identification and targeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t do &#8216;cutting-edge,&rsquo;&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s what Democrats are doing. We&rsquo;re going beyond cutting-edge.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Steele speaks of North Carolina, and Obama&rsquo;s surprise victory there.  NC and Indiana stumped me for months, why they flipped Democrat after years of being reliable Republican votes.  I can rationalize VA   &mdash;   liberal bureaucrats living near D.C., and Ohio because of the economy, CO because of Calikooks running away from the consequences of their actions in CA plus Hispanics moving into CO, and NM because of Hispanics.</p>
<p>However, IN and NC were the most perplexing until I read a Sports Illustrated article while in the doctor&rsquo;s office waiting room several weeks ago.  The answer to the riddle is basketball, Obama plays it regularly and both those states are obsessed with the sport.</p>

			<p> Yes the GOP does need a more relevant makeover. As they are<br>
a boring collecetion of liberal lites. That constantly tap <br>
dance around the true problems that ail our nation. But <br>
they do not need a &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; makeover. That would cause <br>
them to go from liberal lite, to full fledged liberal <br>
Democrat. And in the end, it would do naught to increase <br>
their votes with minorities anyway. They wouldn&rsquo;t be<br>
perceiveied of as having enough &#8220;street cred&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Good luck to him&hellip;. pandering to a class that mocks and riducles conservatives on a daily basis, and ignoring the base that has almost nowhere else to go. </p>
<p>  Every republican solicitaition for funds sent to me is returned to them, with an explanation on why I will no longer contribute. The wild spending, the scandals, the abandonment of the right wing and conservative ideas they touted to get elected in 1994 are why I wont give them a dime. They have cheerfully squandered the peoples support in the past 16 years! They are given my name and  my phone number and an invitation to call me. They never do. </p>
<p> Trying to widen the base by appealing to the hip hop crowd only serves to keep the base at home, feeling no one gives a damn about them. This is a strategy? Prying the hip hop crowd from lord obama will be near impossible and a waste of resources. They would be better served by returning to their conservative, lower taxes, less government interference theme than trying to sell their act to the &#8220;whatcha gonna gimme?&#8221; crowd that has never earned anything in their young lives.  Yawn. </p>

			<p>     The &rsquo; Stupid Party &rsquo; is at it again. After being clobbered in the last two national elections, they want to turn further to the left. Anything you can do I can do better. They put up a doddering old fool for the nation&rsquo;s highest office, hoping that he could capture the Hispanic and moderate vote, and it didn&rsquo;t work. The only way the Republican Party can ever win again is to get back to its common sense conservative ways. Obama is certainly giving them enough ammunition to use. Ronald Reagan must be turning over in his grave seeing that what he taught them is being ignored.</p>

			<p>Mr. Steele makes it clear that the Republican Party in the Old South is no longer welcome nor are they part of the future of the party. </p>
<p>Now do you believe me when I say the South needs to BE the first deliberately regional party. With a third of the US population, no Federal election could be won without their support. Make a new regional party now.</p>

<p>Not much.<br>

			<p>Well, I thought the GOP might finally wake up due to McCain&rsquo;s humiliating defeat in the last election and finally give up chasing the unicorn of multiculturalism, but I now see they haven&rsquo;t learned a thing. To borrow an old phrase from Clarence Pendleton, this is the looniest idea since Looney Tunes! Clearly, even eight years of Obama won&rsquo;t wake the GOP from it&rsquo;s multicultural trance.</p>

<p>im sorry.. one can&rsquo;t help but laugh and i implore you all to do so as well. The GOP is so persistent on alienating their white base, im starting to think it&rsquo;ll be surprising if a third party doesn&rsquo;t suddenly start gaining alot of ground. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve put a black clown in as the chairman, who will make the GOP look even MORE foolish than it has previously. Steele will ensure that when we snickered and giggled at the GOP&rsquo;s weak idle-minded attempts at pandering before, that it will pale in comparison to the gut laughing that will ensue, as he puts things into high gear. </p>
<p>the Republican party is finished. Period. Many of us knew for quite awhile that it was doomed, some knew it was gone eons ago. But its worth noting now, for the GOP has decided to make it no secret to anyone who hasn&rsquo;t gotten the hints. </p>
<p>The GOP and hip-hop.. hand in hand.</p>

<p><br>
So this is the republican party&rsquo;s new great black hope?&hellip;..And how successful has the gop been in attracting nonwhites over the years. His targets are not interested in becoming conservatives or even republicans. To them that would be &#8220;acting white&#8221;. All Steele is going to do is further alienate the republicans white base. But since when has that ever stopped the gop, who apparently is still clueless. Like others have stated here for years, we need a nationalist White party to look out for our interests. </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether the Republicans or Democrats win another election.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that can be donw to straighten out this dysfunctional nation.</p>
<p>Complete disintegration and a rebuilding along racial and political lines is the only thing that I desire right now, and, so far, it looks like I&rsquo;ll get what I want.  We&rsquo;re just at the beginning of an implosion right now, and like the sub-prime crash, we owe it all to multiracialism and the fools behind it who have been in favor of it all along.</p>
<p>Talking about how to improve the Republican party is like talking about redecorating the ball room in the Titanic as it is in the process of sinking.</p>

			<p>After B. Hussein&rsquo;s win, the election of Steele was so utterly predictable it made me want to dry heave.  The GOP is gasping its last breath and they elect this clown as the chairman!?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no huge fan of the Republicans but at least the GOP is not as emphatically anti-White as its counterpart.  Guess they&rsquo;re trying to catch up&hellip;  <br>

			<p>The GOP leadership can always be relied upon to draw exactly the wrong conclusions. The Dems have a Magic African and they won, the Repubs reason, therefore WE need a Magic African too. They&rsquo;re merely alienating more and more of their natural constituency; their vain and stupid attempts at ghetto fabulousness will never make up for the voters they&rsquo;ve lost and will lose as Steele ebonifies the &#8220;conservative&#8221; party. (Question for GOP leadership: when will that mestizo landslide in your favor actually happen? Why hasn&rsquo;t it happened yet?)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of choosing between two virtually indistinguishable parties whose goal seems to be pandering to non-whites, and blacks in particular?</p>

			<p>Without mentioning names, I had the feeling that this post was going to bring out some Reagan idolatry.  On the Presidential level, Reagan&rsquo;s party will never win Reagan&rsquo;s state again because of Reagan&rsquo;s amnesty for illegal aliens.  That the selection of Michael Steele to run the RNC is a measure of GOP PC is right, but don&rsquo;t forget that the very first Presidential campaign ad for a major party candidate was in 1984 for the Reagan campaign.</p>

			<p>If there really is a coherent conservative movement in this country(and I&rsquo;m not at all sure there is), it simply MUST break all ties to this ridiculous party once and for all! The GOP&rsquo;s contempt for its own base is fragrant - and it has been this way for ages! If conservatives have any self-respect and/or any hope of having their ideas represented in the US Government, they will abandon the GOP post haste!</p>

			<p>This guy must be a Demorat mole.  The Stupid Party is hard at work ignoring the coming catastrophe of the 2010 census.  The CPUSA, er, I mean the Democrats, will discover millions of hitherto uncounted minorities.  Then they will scientifically gerrymander the congressional districts so that the House of Representatives will be a one-party entity forever.  More senators will turn RINO, and we will have a de facto one-party system, perfection by the standards of the Democrats.  The Republicans have only one more shot at getting it right in Nov 2010.  It is obvious that will not happen.  The USA as you knew it is over.</p>
<p>I wonder if Russia will someday confront the USSofA to save us from our own government as we once did for them.</p>

			<p>No one at AR needs to be convinced that the Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan does not want Whites to organize as Whites, as a group interested in defednding the West&rsquo;s basic principles of free speech and association under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Steele is simply a part of this. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for a third party or a new country, or, something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>What form it will take, and how it will come about, is another matter, and not at all so simple.</p>

			<p>In 1967 the Beatles released an innovative record called Sgt. Pepper.  Six months later the Rolling Stones abandoned their strength (blues-based music) released an embarassing, half-baked, pallid imitation of Sgt. Pepper called Her Satanic Majesties Request.  Steele is the RNC&rsquo;s version of Satanic Majesties Request.</p>

			<p>At the next Republican hoop-tee-doo, the reps can wear their pants around their knees in deference to gangsta fashion, but unless they start preaching resentment against imaginary slights to blacks and hispanics, they&rsquo;ll look like fools.  </p>
<p>On top of it, they&rsquo;ll have to preach &#8220;gubmint handout for the oh-press peoples&#8221; which is counter to the so-called conservative philosophy. </p>
<p>Still want to go ahead with this fruitless pandering, Mr. Steele?<br>
I&rsquo;d take a pass right now and in a hurry.</p>
<p>I do, however, wish Mr. Steele all the luck.</p>

			<p>If the Stupid Party thinks it will win black votes by putting a stuffed shirt as its party head, it is beyond stupid.</p>
<p>If it thinks that supporting open borders will enable mestizos from south of the border to come here and vote for them, it is beyond stupid. The mestizos will flock to California and Texas, one of whom is already lost to the Stupid party (in an electoral sense), the other one headed that way.</p>
<p>Finally, if anyone here thinks that if the Stupid Party nominates a rock-ribbed conservative in the Goldwater or Reagan mode, they&rsquo;ll be swept into the presidency, well, then you need a reality check.</p>
<p>Count up the electoral votes of California, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Florida. You have well over 150 votes right there. You can&rsquo;t expect a conservative to carry these states nowadays. Heck, Ronald Reagan could not be elected governor of California today, given the state&rsquo;s racial make-up.</p>
<p>If Texas starts voting Democratic in national elections, the Stupid Party can bend over backwards and kiss itself goodbye.</p>

			<p>I was a life long Republican, but I&rsquo;ve now left the party and am looking for a new home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only type of party I could support would be an American version of the BNP  &mdash;  one that is reasonable but which is just for White people  &mdash;  and so far I haven&rsquo;t found one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just stay independent until a proper party comes along.</p>

			<p>Party officials like this Steele guy, and the previous Ken Mehlman, are quick to cast off conservative principles in order to appeal to new voters, because they have no principles (and in the end, they won&rsquo;t get the new voters either).  It&rsquo;s become clear to me that neither does the Republican party any longer.  It is merely a vehicle for the getting and wielding of power.  It believes in nothing certainly and does not represent our interests.</p>
<p>I am a conservative precisely because I loathe the foul pestilence that is hip-hop &#8220;culture&#8221; (a culture only in the sense that a colony of bacteria in agar is a culture).  Now Steele wants to appeal to that?  Well, to hell with him and his party.</p>

			<p>Well said, Old Soldier. I hadn&rsquo;t even considered the connection between minorities, the 2010 census, and redistricting until you brought it up. With that in mind, do you think we ever really stood a chance? &#8220;Demographics are destiny&#8221; and all of that&hellip;</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s quite hard to escape your conclusion that the USA as we knew it is quite dead. We have stepped off the slow boat to socialism and are now on the speed boat to banana republic status. Political connections and identity politics will now rule our destiny and economy in the stead of merit. The fruits of the multicult are finally coming home.</p>

			<p>Selecting Steele sends the message that the GOP doesn&rsquo;t care about the masses of Whites as long as it might gain a miniscule of Blacks and Hispanics. I don&rsquo;t like Ron Paul, but only his &#8220;live and let live&#8221; freedom of association principle and fiscal conservatism might save the party.</p>

			<p>Well there goes the neighborhood.  Steele&rsquo;s dreamy plans to turn the GOP into gangsta rap central will fail.  Even if he is moderately successful it will have the effect of driving away rank and file whites, so it&rsquo;s a strategy that could sink the GOP.  The out of touch, globalist, minority coddling, wine and cheese elites within the party don&rsquo;t count and are the reason for the party&rsquo;s current state of disarray.  </p>
<p>The million dollar question following the election was if the GOP would turn right or left.  I think we have our answer.  </p>

			<p>This is exactly what&rsquo;s happened in once-Great Britain.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;Conservative Party&#8221; (a.k.a. Tory Party) are falling over themselves trying to appeal to blacks and muslims, in a futile attempt to win them over from the communist (Za)Nu Labour Party who are currently in &#8220;government&#8221;. The &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; are, of course, alienating their base support in the process.</p>
<p>This is actually a good thing, as it&rsquo;s driving the disaffected to the British National Party (http://www.bnp.org.uk).</p>
<p>&#8216;Only problem with this scenario in the USA, is that there isn&rsquo;t a viable third party that conservatives can vote for.</p>
<p>Not yet anyway&hellip;</p>

			<p>The GOP nevers fails to astonish me.  You would think that its leaders - regardless of their views on race - would realize that they are never going to accomplish any of their goals without a white America.  Do you honestly think that Jamal or Jose can ever be convinced of the superiority of free market capitalism or constitutional liberty when the Democratic Party is promising them free stuff?</p>

			<p>  The time has come for the republican party to go the way of the whig party. The republican party has lost it&rsquo;s way. It no longer represents conservatives. When the neo-cons took center stage in the party, I knew it was over. Allow the party to end. Pull the plug. We must erect in its place, a nationalist party of our white people. ALL minorities flock to the democratic party anyway. This is our chance to do the right thing for our people. The fine details can be worked out by brighter minds than mine. I just want to see it represent the white people in this country. We are totally ignored even now. Wait until we are a minority in this country, then things will really get interesting. Start a new nationalist party and secure a land for our people, before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Newly elected Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele plans an &ldquo;off the hook&rdquo; public relations offensive to attract younger voters, especially blacks and Hispanics, by applying the party&rsquo;s principles to &ldquo;urban-suburban hip-hop settings.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
DANG&hellip;&hellip;listening to Michael Steele I thought he had a different mindset but I was wrong&hellip;.from reading this it seems that he also believes that winning an election is the only thing that matters&hellip;.I guess he teamed up with Russell Simmons to come up with such clap-trap. In 2005 I gave my unsolicited advise to Ken Melhman to change the course of pandering and predicted that they were going to lose in 2006&hellip;and bang they got wiped out because they compromised the party principles for power&hellip;.now Michael Steele is planning to do the same with his &#8220;off the hook&#8221; hip-hop offensive&hellip;now go ahead and see how far you&rsquo;ll get with that. America needs leadership that has the courage to steer it back to its creed and not the multicultural hogwash that is dividing it&hellip;..we have enough of that non-sense&hellip;..leave it alone.</p>
<p>AMERICA NEEDS PRINCIPAL OVER POWER LEADERSHIP&hellip;not more tribalism!<br>

			<p>What always fascinates me about blacks is that regardless of their education and social standing, they all have pretty much the same vocabulary and mindset.  Steele uses the same terms and expressions (&#8220;hip hop&#8221;, &#8220;off the hook,&#8221;) as blacks you would meet at work or in the grocery store.  Blacks all seem to have  a single &#8220;factory pre-set personality,&#8221; whereas whites have a remarkably wide range of personality traits.   </p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for Indiana but the reason North Carolina went for Obama is not because of Basketball. Its because of an invasion of Yankees and foreigners. That plus our already high black population means demographics has caught up with the old North State. Thus is the fate of Virgina and North Carolina.</p>

			<p>I am in a quandary, trying to figure out when and if it will be necessary to move to Europe.  My mother was a first-generation European immigrant and I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have legal status as a citizen back there.  The only thing standing in my way is loyalty to the USA, but this country seems increasingly on the brink of collapse.  As much as I&rsquo;d love to be part of the solution, I&rsquo;m tired of feeling like a second-class citizen because of my White skin, and I&rsquo;m especially sick of my self-loathing White brethren.  In some strange way, I&rsquo;d rather be a &#8220;minority&#8221; in a successful, nationalist country than a &#8220;majority&#8221; in the self-hating United Socialist States of America.</p>

			<p>About four or five years ago, C-SPAN interviewed Michael Steele who was at that time Lt. Governor of Maryland.  At one point he said words to the effect that - Europeans need to open up more to third world immigration - as if this would in some way benefit Europe.  As an individual, Michael Steele is a decent guy, but at the end of the day, he&rsquo;s simply promoting the Stupid Party&rsquo;s on-going, failed pandering-to-minorities policy.  Why would a true conservative vote GOP when there is essentially no difference in the outcome for the country, no matter what party wins?  Maybe a true geographic homeland for whites is the only answer.  Otherwise, the liberties granted to us by the Founders will be crashed on the rocks of political correctness.</p>

			<p>How did we get here&hellip;.in a country where BOTH major parties have spite and contempt for economic and political conservatives?</p>
<p>I can remember in my lifetime when the DEMOCRATIC party was the conservative party, and the Solid Democrat South was a safe assumption at every election. Now even the Republipuke Party candidate spits in the faces of their own political base.</p>
<p>The South left the Democrat Party in a relatively short period of time because they did not want to be in the same party with ethnic minorities, leftists, feminists, gays, labor unions, liberals, anti-war activists, atheists, environmentalists, drug advocates, and traitors. For decades now, they have been trapped in the Republican Party, which has treated them like adopted pets and not as full members of the party. Now it has become so bad in the Republican party, that our sanctuary has become a prison&hellip;..more like a torture chamber.</p>
<p>We got to where we are today by voting in every election for the LESSER OF TWO EVILS. We compromised everything we thought and believed to vote the candidate we knew to be not quite as bad as the other one. And the Republican party has run RINO presidential candidate after RINO presidential candidate, who are imposters and phoneys. They only seem conservative because they are not as liberal as their opponent. We need to stop compromising. We need to stop voting for the lesser of two evils. We need to withhold our vote and our money until we can have what WE WANT.</p>
<p>In short, boys and girls, we need to STAND UP for what we believe in and stop playing along with the devil because we like the music. We need to STAND UP and say&hellip;&hellip;NO MORE.<br>

<p>In fact I think America has had enough hip hop as a matter of fact. If this is the most genius thing they can come up with, to drag in minorities then I think they should go back to the drawing board. I think at best they can drag in a good 60% of whites, Asian, some Hispanics, and intellectual high class blacks. </p>
<p>I think thats our best bet to take back America in 2012. Thats if people dont have the sour taste of BUSH in their mouths.</p>

			<p>In an article on such a horse-poopey theme, I knew I&rsquo;d find a pony somewhere, and here it is:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we have fallen down in delivering a message is in having something to say,&#8221;</p>
<p>Brilliant. (And for blacks, it could mark a major evolutionary step forward in mental functioning.)</p>
<p>I was also bemused by Steele&rsquo;s statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who said I can&rsquo;t make the trains run on time never gave a reason. I say to them, &#8216;Stuff it.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
<p>One thing I DO appreciate about blacks is that they haven&rsquo;t had their brains stewed as much as whites have on every single thing that has to do with the man whom popular tradition claims DID make the trains run on time! (blacks are too caught up in their OWN victimhood narrative to care about any other)</p>
<p>But remarks that imply that one has the ability to &#8220;make the trains run on time&#8221; do seem particularly obtuse!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;move to Europe&hellip;The only thing standing in my way is loyalty to the USA,..&#8221; (Anonymous at 5:30 PM on February 21)</p>
<p>Some white leaders are recommending we begin to shift our loyalty a little more from our country to our race. (Surely that will inevitably happen, as conditions in the U.S. continue at least for awhile on their present course?)</p>
<p>I can feel myself beginning to make the shift slightly.</p>
<p>It puts the struggle here in a slightly different perspective  &mdash;  one just happens to be fighting on this particular battleground, the ground that was once hallowed (and may become so again) and which one knows the best.</p>

			<p>I may not have been very clear in my last post  &mdash;  there is of course white resistance in white areas all over the world now, stronger in some ways in some places, and stronger in other ways in other places.</p>
<p>Moscow is reported to still be almost totally a white city, and Russia and other parts of the old Soviet Union have movements with high white consciousness.</p>
<p>When one feels a part of a worldwide struggle (instead of just isolated here alone in a crumbling country), one may feel a little better.</p>

Both Peter Brimelow and Steve Sailer at VDare.com are recommending the OPPOSITE of the Steele approach, i.e. rather than &#8220;outreach&#8221; to nonwhites, the GOP should finally start practising &#8220;INREACH&#8221; to whites. If the Republican Party is only going to be supported by whites   &mdash;   and the election of Obama shows that&rsquo;s now undeniably the case   &mdash;   then let the Republican Party SERVE whites. </p>
<p>Well, either that or fall on their sword and make room for a REAL white conservative party. Either way, conservative American whites NEED a party to represent us. </p>

			<p>Chairman Steele should expand his reach out. I am a supporter of NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association. We supported the party for generations and they helped us in many ways. Our congressman, Mark Foley, was protected and allowed to pursue our agenda of lowering the age of consent to an ancient 10.Our senator Larry Craig was allowed to keep on the down low by the Grand Old party.<br>
     The Hip Hoppers, or rough trade as we call them, are far to Philistine to accept the party`s overtures. We, however, need to be brought back home. The Puritanical democrats have actually put a lock on the page`s dorm front door and confiscated the kid`s dope and booze stash.<br>
     Learning about the joys of sex by a mature sophisticated man will make it easier for the party to screw them when adults If they squeal like little pigs when young, they can take anything from the GOP.<br>

<p>I am willing to give the guy a shot. I have seen enough of him to think he has convictions and not just some token guy up there. The Republicans need to stand for something. Look, if the guy can help pull in some more blacks or Hispanics without being a La Raza type or a Sharpton type, so be it. The past leader of the party imploded. Where was the strategy? And 2010 gives Repubs. a real shot at winning some seats back. Grassroots wins.</p>

			<p>I am no longer a Republican having left the party sick of its hypocrisy. Most of our freedoms and most of the debt is a result of Reagan and both Bushs presidencies. The GOP is a broken record. Pretend to be fiscially conservative and then as soon as you get power spend all you can just like a sailor in Subic Bay on a Friday night. I have no respect left for the GOP. I never had any for the leftards. My point is they have become irrelevant to me. They might as well have run Obama for president.</p>

<p>Whites are actually starting to wake up to a new understanding of race and reality that is shorn of the old less than bright ideas about the subject that left some of us, who do know the importance of race, wanting no part of the ignorance once spewed about the subject.</p>
