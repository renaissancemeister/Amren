<h1><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/29161589?__source=RSS*blog*&amp;par=RSS">NEWBOs: The Rise of the New Black Overclass</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Dauble, CNBC, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;NEWBOs: The Rise of America&rsquo;s New Black Overclass,&#8221; is an original one-hour primetime documentary about the growing wave of young black multimillionaires coming out of the sports, media and entertainment industries. This project examines the rise of &#8220;Newbos,&#8221;  &mdash;  young black athletes, entertainers, and creative entrepreneurs  &mdash;  who, with the right amount of financial literacy, collaboration, intergenerational mentorship and social awareness, could have a profound, positive impact on black America. The special, hosted by Wall Street Journal reporter and CNBC correspondent Lee Hawkins, who coined the term &#8220;Newbo,&#8221; is based on Hawkins&rsquo; forthcoming book of the same title.</p>
<p>Newbos captures the pressures and prominence of the fascinating Newbo class and includes data about the wealth and financial impact of black athletes and entrepreneurial black music moguls in America. Contradicting old-guard leaders who assert that Newbos offer little to the black community as a whole, Hawkins puts the spotlight on the entrepreneurial, social and charitable efforts of several Newbos and their contagious financial power. The documentary offers behind-the-marquee stories on several high-profile Newbos, including NBA superstar LeBron James, Major League All-Star Torii Hunter, The Williams brothers of Cash Money Records, Dallas Cowboy star Terrell Owens, billionaire entrepreneur and Newbo pioneer Bob Johnson and musician, Multiplatinum gospel star Kirk Franklin, and television network owner Wyclef Jean.</p>
<p>There are more black multimillionaires and potential billionaires in the United States than ever before, and a startling new black overclass has emerged out of these three industries, generating billions of dollars of income per year. While there is no shortage of coverage of the unfortunate realities of black America  &mdash;  such as crime, incarceration rates, and wealth disparities  &mdash;  this is the first analysis of the growing number of self-made young black multimillionaires and the impact fast-wealth has on them and others that surround them.</p>
<p>Newbos exposes and chronicles the experiences and insights of these men and women as they move from relative poverty to fantastic wealth at a very young age. Hawkins examines how the Newbos&rsquo; unconventional paths to success have become blueprints for broader independence and entrepreneurship, and how this segment of black society has a disproportionately heavy influence over millions of people.</p>
<p>In a post-Obama victory era that has widened the range of role models for African-American youth, Hawkins turns the spotlight on some of the nation&rsquo;s highest profile athletes and entertainers and asks them poignant questions they are rarely asked. How exactly have they built their brands and their businesses? Does their fame and status insulate them from the problems of the broader black community? Do they feel they have a responsibility to the rest of black America? How important are social awareness and charitable involvement? What do they think about Barack Obama? Will they rise to the challenges and opportunities that accompany their wealth and fame or will they squander their clout in frivolity?<br>

			<p>This list is mostly athletes and musicians (if you want to call most of what they do music).  What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that for every one that started out with nothing and gets the big money, then parlays that into more wealth and power, there are many who wind up squandering their first real paydays on the stereotypical usual trappings of the &#8220;bling&#8221; culture, and go broke.</p>
<p>Other than sports, music and media, the only one I see is Sean John, and that&rsquo;s P. Diddy&rsquo;s clothing line, based on his initial music contracts and royalties.  I don&rsquo;t find Sean John particularly profound, I think most people buy it because of P. Diddy.  No music, and no Sean John, end of story.  Note that &#8220;Sean&#8221; is Irish for &#8220;John,&#8221; so the name is actually redundant.<br>

<p>*Sports* *Media* *Entertainment*. I would comment but I&rsquo;d be accused of making a racial stereotype. I will note that conspicuously absent are Nobel prizing winning physicists and others in science industries.</p>

			<p>Oh what fun!</p>
<p>1.) &#8220;Does their fame and status insulate them from the problems of the broader black community?&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes indeed, until they get some gin and crack in their systems, then all bets (BETs) are off!</p>
<p>2.)&#8221;Do they feel they have a responsibility to the rest of black America?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe, unless it involves marriage; then some whorish blond &#8220;Playboy&#8221; heifer with fake udders, is the order of the day!</p>
<p>3.)&#8221;How important are social awareness and charitable involvement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not as &#8220;important&#8221; as kicking a white member of the opposing team in the face or gonads, be sure of that!</p>
<p>4.)&#8221;What do they think about Barack Obama?&#8221;</p>
<p>The real question here is, can they &#8220;think&#8221; at all?</p>
<p>5.) &#8220;Will they rise to the challenges and opportunities that accompany their wealth and fame or will they squander their clout in frivolity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or will they squander it OJ style, with the slaughtering of their whorish blond &#8220;Playboy&#8221; heifers with fake udders?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>The ONLY reason there are so many &#8220;self made&#8221; black millionaires is because they live among Whites that made it possible. None of them could have made it without White people backing them. Look at Opray for instance.  Did she start her career out of her garage with a black base, or did she go from one White radio/t.v. station to another with a White fan base? I&rsquo;ve watched a show on the story of her life and I KNOW it was the latter. The same goes for the rest of these &#8220;self made&#8221; black millionaires, NONE of them could have done it without White backing and know-how. Except for a few black dictators that stole foreign aid money or assets, how many &#8220;self made&#8221; millionaires are there in Africa?  </p>

			<p>I know of few wealthy blacks in the South here.They make their money in privatized homes that cater to wayward girls, violent boys.My problem with their wealth is that the community that starts the fires of despair and neglect are getting paid to put out their own fires they started.</p>

			<p>These men behave very foolishly,instead of taking their wealth and trying to build up their own communities and pouring resources into them they flock to lilly white neighborhoods that are overly wealthy. These neighborhoods don&rsquo;t need them and will do just fine without them. There are nice black uppermiddle class black communties they can live in with homes as high as 2Million and great private and magnet schools, and low crime. I know because I live here with my wife. They flock to women who are already secure in life and offer her more while their own women suffer raising children alone.They marry outside of their race at a disproportionate rate giving black women few options for mates as many many other races aren&rsquo;t attracted to them. If they weren&rsquo;t rich there was no way  they could have gotten the women they got. The women don&rsquo;t truly love them and the divorce rate is extremely high. They indirectly increase the incarceration of young males and violence in black communities by  leaving the women with irresponsible, immature, and unreliable men. There are very few succesful and hardworking men for our sistas, and very few role models for young black men  and these men only exacerbate the problem.  I laugh at their silliness because they think they&rsquo;re actually helping. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much charity work they do for the black community it is minuscule in comparison to the great damage they cause us.  They don&rsquo;t care about racial solidarity or ethnic pride. They are selfish disloyal traitors. </p>

			<p>Note how they all come from either athletics or entertainment mediums like music, movies etc. These are the only areas where blacks excel. Neither of these areas requires a great deal of intelligence.</p>

			<p>The real question is how many of them will KEEP their wealth. How many of these &#8220;NEWBO&rsquo;S&#8221; will stay be rich 10, 15 or 20 years from now? Given black spending habits and their propensity towards &#8220;bling&#8221; I bet a lot of them won&rsquo;t hang on to their coin.</p>

<p>Some people may not like it but it is a fact&hellip;it would be interesting to know what impact this fast-wealth has on them and others that surround them and on society at large&hellip;money talks and all the rest walks!</p>

			<p>I remember perhaps seven or eight years ago now, I found a copy of a magazine on the newsstand proudly celebrating some milestone(a century perhaps) of &#8220;African-American&#8221; achievemnt. I distincly recall that I impulsively purchased it because I was struck immediately by the cover which was a collage of many photos - virtually every one was a celebrity of some sort. Sure enough, the cover was indeed indicative of what the magazine was &#8220;celebrating.&#8221; With precious few exceptions, the whole periodical was packed with actors, singers/entertainers, professional sports figures, political officials, and of course &#8220;civil-rights&#8221; icons&hellip;and essentially nothing else! </p>
<p>This was Black &#8220;achievment&#8221; wrapped-up in neat little package. <br>
Entertainers, athletes, and activists. But what have these people really achived? What have they done to better the world, or even their own communities? Where were the life-giving medical discoveries? the surgeons, the inventors, the engineers, the visionaries, the technological poineers, the global explorers, the scientists, the&hellip;? Well, you get the idea!! </p>

			<p>Overclass?  You mean to opine that they have education, taste, care for the less fortunate, treat weaker members of society (women and children) with chivalric regard, give to charities, etc.?</p>
<p>The little help they do give to greater society is countered by the thug culture, selfish lifestyles that they exude.  &#8220;Rich Black Underclass&#8221; is a better descriptor.</p>

			<p>A huge percentage of black millionaires are athletes or entertainers.  With an economic depression coming, you have to wonder how salaries will drop for athletes.  Baseball has already had a major contraction of salaries with basketball salaries expected to be reined in over the next few years.  As an example, will the Detroit Pistons be able to fill its 20,000 seat arena any longer with the auto companies and the city of Detroit virtually bankrupt?  Poor Allen Iverson!!!</p>
<p>A caveat for wealthy black athletes is that most are careless with their money and don&rsquo;t think of their futures after their abilities don&rsquo;t bring home the big salaries any longer.  More black athletes are like Shawn Kemp, who is a father of eight illegitimate children and has gone through most of his earnings, than they are like Karl Malone, who has lived a settled life and saved and invested well.</p>

<p>If they have any sense or value their wealth they do.</p>
<p>Look at P Diddy (the most notably successful black entepreneur) All his key personel are white, otherwise he&rsquo;d be out of business and bankrupt in five minutes, and he knows it.</p>
<p>Same goes for Oprah, Chris Rock and all the rest.</p>
<p>They may all have a whole bunch of blacks working in visible positions. For instance most of their security is probably black but I guarantee each of them have a white Head-Of-Security, Chief publicist, and white any other key role.</p>

			<p>Take away athletics, entertainment and AA and (legally) successful rich blacks are as rare as snow in the Sahara. You will also observe that being a successful basketball player, boxer or rap singer requires virtually nothing in the way of character, moral fiber or intelligence. Where is the black Donald Trump or Warren Buffet? </p>

			<p>Again, modern America, unlike the Founders&rsquo; America, tends to reward extravagantly those who merely entertain. In this case, this is not a racial statement. In recent decades white and black entertainers and sports figures alike have received monetary rewards hugely disproportionate to their actual contribution to the prosperity of the nation.</p>
<p>While the country is bankrupt, morally and financially, the hard-working people who actually pay the bills and keep the country running are being bled dry through confiscatory taxation and the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, as well as opportunities lost to the Affirmative Action racket.</p>

			<p>For the negative responders:Everyone have opinons about young black multi-millions .Wheather they made it by dribbling a ball or making senseless lyrics in a rap song,the accomplishment of success is enough to be praised,not ridiculed.I can guranteed that not one of you tried to pull a young black millionare to the side and educated them on how to properly conduct themselves or support the communities they come from.The education process never ends.Its too many JUDGES and not enough TEACHERS.You want to diagnose a problem,first examine the symptoms,what i mean is,if you dont know what you are talking about keep your moronic opinions.Building wealth has no color code because when you&rsquo;re poor,it dont matter if you&rsquo;re black,white,blue,or high yellow you&rsquo;re just poor.Become a servant of a the community and help out instead of pointing your money grubbing fingers and remaining ridiculously enthnocentric.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Overclass&#8221; in this sense should relate to the tendency for new-money black folks to overcompensate for the lack of wealth in previous generations. Spending disproportionate amounts of cash on luxury cars, jewelry, clothes&hellip;all that &#8220;bling&#8221;, while not saving, piling up debt and failing to fulfill basic financial obligations. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for you &#8220;Dwayne&#8221;. I&rsquo;m sure I speak for for all my WHITE brothers and sisters here at Amren when I say that we Whites are under NO obligation to be SERVANTS to YOUR community. We&rsquo;ve driven that road for decades now, and look were we&rsquo;re at.  The truth of the matter is that the reason blacks are where they are today is because they&rsquo;ve received TOO MUCH help from guilt ridden White folks. Go to most any charitable or. and the people volunteering their time and money working there are WHITE and the people in line to get the &#8220;free stuff&#8221; aren&rsquo;t. All we get in return is a slap across the face [sometimes literally] from the people we were trying to &#8220;understand&#8221;. I have a friend that volunteered his time for the Katrina &#8220;refugees&#8221; at the Astro dome in Houston. The stories of lack of gratitude and out right hostility toward the Whites working there by the black &#8220;refugees&#8221; even surprized me [and I&rsquo;m seasoned]. It took less than a week to convert him from liberal to realist working in that place. Years of me trying to tell him &#8220;the ways of life&#8221; did no good. Less than a week at the Dome, and now he&rsquo;s on &#8220;real time&#8221;. </p>
