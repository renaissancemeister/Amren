			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Sowell, Creators Syndicate, February 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 directed federal regulatory agencies to &#8220;encourage&#8221; banks and other lending institutions &#8220;to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The real potential of that premise became apparent in the 1990s, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) imposed a requirement that mortgage lenders demonstrate with hard data that they were meeting their responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act.</p>
<p>What HUD wanted were numbers showing that mortgage loans were being made to low-income and moderate-income people on a scale that HUD expected, even if this required &#8220;innovative or flexible&#8221; mortgage eligibility standards.</p>
<p>In other words, quotas were imposed  &mdash;  and if some people didn&rsquo;t meet the standards, then the standards need to be changed.</p>
<p>Both HUD and the Department of Justice began bringing lawsuits against mortgage bakers when a higher percentage of minority applicants than white applicants were turned down for mortgage loans.</p>
<p>A substantial majority of both black and white mortgage loan applicants had their loans approved but a statistical difference was enough to get a bank sued.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the same statistical sources from which data on blacks and whites were obtained usually contained data on Asian Americans as well.</p>
<p>But those data on Asian Americans were almost never mentioned.</p>
<p>Whites were turned down for mortgage loans more often than Asian Americans. But saying that would undermine the reasoning on which the whole moral melodrama and political crusades were based.</p>
<p>Lawsuits were only part of the pressures put on lenders by government officials. Banks and other lenders are overseen by regulatory agencies and must go to those agencies for approval of many business decisions that other businesses make without needing anyone else&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>Government regulators refused to approve such decisions when a lender was under investigation for not producing satisfactory statistics on loans to low-income people or minorities.</p>
<p>Under growing pressures from both the Clinton administration and later the George W. Bush administration, banks began to lower their lending standards.</p>
<p>Mortgage loans with no down payment, no income verification and other &#8220;creative&#8221; financial arrangements abounded. Although this was done under pressures begun in the name of the poor and minorities, people who were neither could also get these mortgage loans.</p>
<p>With mortgage loans widely available to people with questionable prospects of being able to keep up the payments, it was an open invitation to financial disaster.</p>

		<p>We bought our home in 2005 for $600,000, it was new and each weekend we had to wait in line and get on the waiting list, there were 60-80 people inline ahead of us, each 2 weeks the builder raised prices 20-40 thousand but we finally got to the front of the line only to find out the home we wanted was now $100,000 more than when we started the process. Now our neighborhood is a ghost town, every third home is vacant or for sale and our home is now valued at $350,000 and still sinking. I now understand why there were long lines to buy homes, anyone who could sign their name could get a loan and they were pre-approved, and now I understand what drove the housing bubble, the govt. policy that required banks to lend to who ever applied, this policy created the demand that drove up home prices. So Mr. Obama, since you and your party are responsible for the housing bubble and subsequent housing collapse because of the the CRA, an act that is after your own heart, and since you and your party could have prevented the collapse way back in 2004 but refused to, I feel you and your party are obligated to make me whole by absorbing the difference in the inflated price I paid in 2005 and today.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m one of those irresponsible buyers who got in over their heads, or refinanced and took out all the equity Mr. Obama, we put 20% down and got a good mortage and have made every payment. no Mr. Obama we just resent being screwed by you and your party because you put your constituents above americans</p>

		<p>The order to cater to minorities by giving them a mortgage even though they couldn&rsquo;t meet loan qualifications by first Carter, then Clinton, then carried forward by Maxine Waters, Barney Frank and Chris Dodd, was the reason for the entire global house of cards to collapse.</p>
<p>It can be said that greedy loan brokers were at fault also, and, of course, they were.</p>
<p>But if there were no minority sub-primes there would have been no crash.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism and diversity brought this global empire down as many knew it would.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an addendum to that:  The pro-black/non-white spending bills of Obama&rsquo;s will be the last diversity touch that will cause the final destruction.</p>
<p>And all along they told us that &#8220;Diversity is our strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some strength, eh?</p>

		<p>Sowell is one of the few high profile scholars who is allowed to tell the truth without being anihilated by the &#8220;Liberal&#8221; thought police. (They can&rsquo;s silence him by calling him a &#8220;racist&#8221;, I suppose.)</p>
<p>Here is a link to a less theoretic analysis that leads to the same conclusion as Sowell&rsquo;s:</p>
