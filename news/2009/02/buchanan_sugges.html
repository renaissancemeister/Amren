<h1>Buchanan Suggests Obama Have a Real Conversation With America</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick J. Buchanan, Catholic Citizens of Illinois, February 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America . Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to. This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:</p>
<p>First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. {snip}</p>
<p>Second, no people anywhere have done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the &rsquo;60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks  &mdash;  with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas  &mdash;  to advance black applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.</p>
<p>We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???</p>
<p>Barack talks about new &#8216;ladders of opportunity&rsquo; for blacks. Let him go to Altoona. And Johnstown Pa, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for &#8216;deserving&rsquo; white kids. Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America? Is it really white America&rsquo;s fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?</p>
<p>Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t remember Buchanan ever being this direct!!! Good for him. I think that our attitudes and opinions here at AR are percolating down to the general populace, slowly but surely. In these hard economic times, I think Whites are fed up with people who take and demand, but rarely give.</p>

		<p>Since AG Holder&rsquo;s first announcement that he wants a dialogue on race, neither he nor anyone else in the Obama Administration has said a peep about it.  Methinks they don&rsquo;t like some of the conversation they&rsquo;re receiving, I suppose they thought that whites with brains were too afraid to speak their mind because of the ascension of The Messiah.</p>

		<p> This will never happen! The Supreme Court, Congress, Senate and the Executive Branch will never take another path. They have almost succeeded in thier goal of total domination of the white race on behalf of the minorities and they will never surrender now.<br>
 The white race will continue to be subordinated to the other races forver. As more blacks move into positions of authority, they will surround themselves with ever more &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; types and shut the door in the face of any white person looking for a job.<br>
 The task began by President Eisenhower on Sep.24, 1957 is rapidly approaching a conclusion. Only the hand of God can stop it now.</p>

I watched the video of Buchanan and Dyson where Dyson simply ran off a list of &#8216;black history&rsquo; that he believes is important for racial healing. What possible good will it do to incessantly repeat the name Emmett Till?</p>
<p>(Incidentally, CBS 60 Minutes reported that 5 black men were implicated in the death of Emmett Till: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/de3rw3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/de3rw3</a> . Is this something Mr. Dyson is willing to talk about in regards to Emmett Till?)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly being told that for blacks to achieve anything, blacks and whites need to know the &#8216;black experience&rsquo; in America.</p>
<p>Has Martin Luther King JRs national birthday done anything to improve blacks? Has black history month done anything to improve blacks? What is this missing magic piece of history that once revealed to everyone will transform blacks into high achievers? </p>
<p>Is it invoking the name Emmett Till or Rosa Parks or Malcolm X? And just how is this transformation to happen?</p>
<p>If blacks want a future, they need to leave the past. It&rsquo;s one thing to know the past. It&rsquo;s another thing to live.</p>
<p>Picking at a scab only means the wound will never heal.</p>

		<p>I watched the video linked on this page where Pat Buchanan debates a black professor and mentions the above statistics. All the professor did was blame white people for black problems such as disproportionate crime and shockingly high illegitimacy rates. One would expect such drivel to be coming out of a black high school drop-out, but for some reason I&rsquo;m not really surprised to hear the same garbage articulated better from a black professor.</p>
<p>When will black Americans take responsibility for their failures and acknowledge that white people have done all they can to help? Actually, a better way of asking that question would be: When are most white people going to realize that they&rsquo;re not responsible for black failure and to stop helping because it&rsquo;s futile?</p>

		<p>Dyson might have opened his mouth once too often, because he&rsquo;s prompted Buchanan to address the inabilities and failings of blacks, and his column, I&rsquo;m told, is read by many in Congress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written Buchanan thanking him for sticking up for us, when no others in the MSM or those in political office will do the same.  I also added a lot of other black patologies that deserve to be pointed out.</p>
<p>I received a response back from his assistant, Linda Muller, asking me to post on the web site&rsquo;s forum, because Pat reads the comments from his readers.</p>
<p>Does anybody but me think it might be a good idea to have several Amrenners post on his forum with an eye towards concentrating on subjects we feel need to be addressed?</p>
<p>I think his column was good, but there are far more black issues that could have been raised which are raised on this web site.  </p>
<p>Most of his info came from the Color of Crime, so I suspect he reads Jared Taylor as do several other right leaning writers and politicians, and it appears as if he&rsquo;s read Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions,&#8221; as well, so the above column and his debate with Dyson more than likely came from Taylor&rsquo;s publications and writings.  </p>
<p>If anybody here wants a point addressed in one of Buchanan&rsquo;s columns, it&rsquo;s possible a person harping enough about a particular subject on his web site just might get his points aired nationally.</p>

		<p>Mr. Buchanan asks:</p>
<p>&#8220;We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope that is meant to be ironic?</p>
<p>We will never, ever, have a word of &#8220;gratitude&#8221; from blacks as a group in this country; they are our enemies, in every sense of the word! That is simply a hard fact of life. They hate us because they wish they were us. Moreover, I believe they hate us all the more for all the good turns we have done them in the last 60 years, because it has not &#8220;magically&#8221; transformed them into whites.</p>
<p>They scream for an &#8220;equality&#8221; that can never be, and they act out violently in frustration over this reality endlessly. The more we cater to them, only throws fuel on that churning Red hot hate of their&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>Enough is enough!</p>
<p>As a group, whites need not have a &#8220;real conversation&#8221; with these predatory black interlopers about racial issues at all; we need to have that conversation among ourselves only. We need to ask the simple question, &#8216;what do we get out of fostering this false sense of entitled &#8220;equality&#8221; amongst them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The answer to that is even more simple, we get nothing but sorrow and bleeding out of that.</p>
<p>With that simple answer, comes an even more basic solution to the black problem: Unapologetic Apartheid!</p>
<p>End of story!!!<br>

		<p>Here is an interesting clip on youtube.  The black Republican strategist wants the Republicans to be more like the Democrats and reach out (or pander) specifically to blacks.  Buchanan wants the Republicans to stand for what conservatives believe in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnuWHdWLWQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnuWHdWLWQ</a></p>
<p>At the end of the clip, Mike Paul thinks Pat Buchanan personally insulted him and is angry.  Pat is bewildered.  It shows just how difficult it is to discuss race even tangentially.</p>

		<p>I watched the video and I think that if every white in this country had a chance to watch it, the general opinion of Buchanan would go up 500%. Maybe there would be a call for him to run for president again. </p>
<p>Also, I find it rather humorous that despite Dyson&rsquo;s claim that we need an &#8220;honest dialog&#8221; about race, he showed himself unable to speak agreeably about the subject even for the brief interview (technical difficulties aside). </p>
<p>Although Buchanan did get a little heated in the debate, Dyson showed the typical black tendency to try to filibuster and to concede nothing, claiming the Jesse Jackson has already covered the ground of black responsibility! Not Bill Cosby, mind you, but Jesse Jackson! That would have been laughable if it weren&rsquo;t so pathetic. Even if Jackson ever did address the issue, the idea that one man addressing this subject constitutes a nationwide dialog shows just what kind of &#8220;dialog&#8221; blacks really want.</p>

		<p> Bravo, Mr. Buchanan! You hit the nail right on the head! Whatever &#8220;sins&#8221; a minority of White people may have committed against blacks, they have long ago been paid back, many times over.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s time that blacks started taking responsibility for their own shortcomings. We don&rsquo;t owe them special advantages forever and ever amen. But until we elect some White politicians   &mdash;   make that STATESMEN   &mdash;   with enough backbone to stand up to the Jesses and the Als and SAY that, and then make it stick, we&rsquo;ll continue to be led around by the nose by the Africans in our midst.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Buchanan for years and voted for him when he twice ran for president. He is a patriot and probably the most enlightened political commentator alive today. I look forward to his writings on Vdare and other places. We&rsquo;d have a teriffic country today if Pat were president. Look what we get instead and people wonder why the country is in such poor shape. </p>

		<p>What game is the Attorney General playing?  He can&rsquo;t possibly want a real airing of White grievances.  Once Whites no longer need fear for their jobs, a tsunami of anger could sweep the multi-cultis away.  Just as the Soviet Union was destroyed by &#8220;glastnost&#8221;, the Diverse Empire cannot bear honest, open discussion.  Why is the AG goading Whitey?  Is he delusional?  <br>
     I sometimes wonder if there are powers behind the powers that be, encouraging the unfit to reveal themselves so as to make The Great Culling easier.  I would surely hate to be a disarmed White leftist explaining to other Whites why affirmative action is good.</p>

		<p>Buchanon is of course right and he is right that &#8220;reparations&#8221; have been paid. But, it&rsquo;s nothing blacks will agree with or admit to because keeping whitey under their thumb by playing &#8220;victim&#8221; and grievance hustling has paid off handsomely for them and they have no intention of ending the hustle. This extortion has worked so well that every other racial group along with muslims have jumped on the grievance bandwagon looking for their pound of flesh.</p>

		<p>Pat never ceases to amaze me. I love this guy to death, I think he had the right idea. I think that he has what it takes to debate blacks. I went to a black school and I remember simular stats being read when I was in class and blacks kids would take it with a grain of salt. They need this drilled into their heads from the first grade.</p>
<p>He can also tackle immigration. We no longer need it and he can take it on for  the greater good of our people. It is hurting our nation.</p>

		<p>I think that AG Holder&rsquo;s statement about us being &#8220;a nation of cowards&#8221; is true in a sense.  We are cowards because we (whites) don&rsquo;t have the courage to openly tell people like Holder to go **** themselves.  But maybe this is now beginning to change. If whites now start refusing to apologize and hitting back at the Holders in this country, then we will have begun to regain our courage as a nation.</p>

		<p>That was a most enlightening video.  Of course, Pat Buchanan is 100% right about all that he was saying. Dyson&rsquo;s only response was the usual attempt to take over the debate.  I&rsquo;m wondering if Dyson might try to claim that the technical difficulties were due to racism.  As others have stated here and in comments <br>
on the first article about Holder&rsquo;s calling us cowards, it is impossible to have a dialog about race with blacks.  Blacks have never been famous for confusing themselves with facts.  In many cases, any attempt at &#8220;debate&#8221; would lead to greater and greater anger on both sides to the point that violence may seem to be<br>
an acceptable alternative. Who wants to carry on a prolonged conversation with someone who starts spewing lies in an &#8220;in your face&#8221; stance?  </p>
<p>It has been my pleasure, indeed honor, to know many of those &#8220;cowards&#8221; who went off to war in WWII, and we AMRENers know just how they, as well as many who came before them, have secured the freedoms we cherish with their tenacity, bravery, blood and their lives.  I daresay that there are still <br>
some young-at-heart, not to mention young in vitality, WWII vets whom I would love to see Dyson call &#8220;cowards&#8221; to their faces!!!  Alas, I don&rsquo;t have the answers to America&rsquo;s dilemma.  As others have stated here, maybe by continually writing and speaking the facts we will eventually open more eyes to the truth.  Perhaps we can derail the leftie-commie-multicultis&rsquo; obvious drive to take over the minds of our youth. Whether or not we can undo the damage done by 50+ years of brainwashing remains to be seen.  It sickens me to know that history about our &#8220;mistreatment&#8221; of Japanese in America is being rewritten by the Reds.  It sickens and saddens me deeply to know that young people are being taught<br>
to condemn Confederate soldiers as villains who wanted nothing more than to perpetuate slavery. </p>

<p>The rest of the post is worth reading, though pretty gloomy. And the poster may be right. I mention family often here at AR, and for a reason. It is the first teaching-learning institution any of us pass through and that is still the case though the Marxists are doing what they can to erase that forever. But until they do it still is of prime importance. <br>
And yet, when the subject comes up people suddenly sound like their tongues were cut in half. <br>
I&rsquo;m not here to absolutize Family, but it&rsquo;s importance is creating people willing and able to live in a Democratic society is central and should be included in the conversation beyond the usual platitudes. <br>
In my family and others (that of friends and relatives, etc) the family system was anything but democratic and it was often very violent. And yet, many of those people today, principley the Offenders, like to consider themselves part of what I refer to as the Liberal-Left-Neocon Leviathan. But you&rsquo;ll certainly find them on the Right too.<br>
My point is ANY talk of what we should do that does not include this subject is whistling in the wind. Every little bit helps, and you know that if pressed, most people would have a lot to say on the subject. That way we would have a much better idea of just how it relates to the bigger picture. I think it would be enormously helpful for us.<br>

		<p>As Buchanan rather obliquely points out, American blacks should fall to their knees every day of their lives and thank the God that made them that their ancestors were imported from Africa and brought to the Americas (particularly to the USA).

		<p>One only needs to be around blacks to realize what they are.  I am in a community college class right now.  One of the two teachers is black, and she is great and very professional. She doesn&rsquo;t speak ebonics and is married with a family.  We also have one black student.  She is an obnoxious, loud-mouthed trouble-maker.  This is a very basic nursing course and both teachers are RNs.  As soon as the other teacher chimes in with another thought, the black &#8220;student&#8221; starts to roll her eyes and starts muttering how it &#8220;confuses&#8221; her.  She needs to be spoon-fed.  She was getting low test scores and moaned how she is not good at taking tests.  Then the teacher told her what material to &#8220;specifically&#8221; study and she got a good grade.  She gave that fact away because that morning, before class started, a few of us were going over the material and she started shouting to &#8220;shut up! you are confusing me!  That&rsquo;s not what the teacher told me to study!&#8221;.  Have I got it wrong, or is that a round-about way of giving her the test answers?  The rest of us had quite a bit of material to cover over 3 chapters.  I am SO aware that I am in a liberal environment.  </p>

<p>I believe you are asking the relevant question here. If there is one thing I immediately noticed about the Obama Administration it would be a tendency its officials have for the message behind the message. Even and especially Pres. Obama, is constantly making some point, which after a short while, gets seen as something different altogether. This administration is going to engage in the same or even greater stealth with Americans interests, as the Bush Administration did. Americans have got to wake up, join those people who have their best interests at heart and start to become pro-active with the elites in this nation or we will most likely be destroyed by them.</p>

		<p>This article explains why I voted for Mr. Buchanan for President.  We shall rue the day that America turned it&rsquo;s back on Pat&rsquo;s no-nonsense approach to our nation.  He had the answers back in 2000, no one wanted to hear them.  We instead got the &#8220;moderate&#8221; GW Bush, who wanted to &#8220;reach across the aisle&#8221; to the leftists, who spit in his face on a weekly basis, bashed him with false accusations on a daily basis and with the help of the main stream media and lots of George Soros&rsquo; cash  gave us our first socialist President. B. Hussein Obama.  As always, God Help Us!!!</p>

		<p>This is so Orwellian.  Bill Clinton pushed for a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; about race, but it was just a liberal establishment monologue, honking out the same old platitudes, and false ones at that.</p>
<p>The establishment and the black people themselves fear, consciously or subconsciously the actual, genuine, awful TRUTH.  It is a dangerous thing, it can&rsquo;t be unleashed because it would unravel all the ill-gotten gains of the liberal-minority overlords.</p>
<p>About the only way to impress falsehoods on the people is for powerful authority figures to keep repeating it over and over and over again.  I suspect many people know the diversity and equality mantras are false, but they do know there are real penalties to be paid, legally, financially and socially, by sticking one&rsquo;s neck out and telling the truth.  There are few social rewards for upstart white racial realists to challenge the status quo.  It is perceived to be safer to keep one&rsquo;s head low and one&rsquo;s mouth shut.</p>

		<p>This topic brings to mind the following situation.  </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was a secular, thuggish dictator who brutally treated his political enemies and ruled the rival Kurd, Shia and Sunni religious, ethnic and tribal factions in Iraq with an iron fist.(*)</p>
<p>So just as Saddam could only keep his fractious country under control by using terror and other forms of intimidation, the U.S. government and society at large use white race guilt and the legal system as tools of intimidation to, among other things (like anti-white job discrimination) keep whites from expressing their honest opinions about other races, epecially blacks and hispanics.  Except when it comes to protecting whites from black (and illegal alien hispanic) predations, the Federal government and &#8220;progressive&#8221; elites couldn&rsquo;t care less. The iron fist in the velvet glove is how our rulers keep the lid on all out racial conflict in the US, with whites bearing the brunt of this tyrannical control. </p>
<p><br>
(*)[I&rsquo;m not defending the US attack on Iraq here; just drawing a parallel. Iraqi society was one of the more civilized, Western-friendly Arab countries in the Middle East (the others being Jordan, Syria and Lebanon).  Under the Baathist regime, a Western visitor could go into a Baghdad bar and drink liquor.  The women could get college educations and didn&rsquo;t have to cover themselves in Islamic garb if they didn&rsquo;t want to.  On its surface, one could say US society displays similar features.  A foreigner briefly visiting the US and not knowing much about its racial/ethnic friction beforehand would likely be none the wiser.] </p>

		<p>I really like Pat Buchanan. He&rsquo;s one of the few people in the public eye to have any backbone at all. My concern, though, is that the few people who will speak out about various issues of importance to Americans are older. I think Pat Buchanan is in his 70&rsquo;s and so is Ron Paul with Tom Tancredo in his 60&rsquo;s. <br>
   What will happen when we no longer have these men? Are there any younger men out here who will carry the ball? I know Lou Barletta is a good man with backbone but are there any others?</p>

		<p>Great White Observer makes a good point about O&rsquo;Reilly.  He sucks up to Sharpton and Mark Lamont Hill on his show.  On both radio and TV, he has stated that whites and blacks are the same and that there is no difference between them.(If that&rsquo;s the case, why are their cultures so different?).  O&rsquo;Reilly also stated on the radio one day, that the Bell Curve is wrong and has been proven so by others.  He never went on to state who it was that showed it to be false.  Yeah, he&rsquo;s really looking out for us.</p>

<p>So true.  Obama is an amoral liar.  Almost everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie.  It&rsquo;s astounding to me that his low black admixture has managed to guarantee his thoroughgoing blackness in this regard.  In most ways he&rsquo;s white, but this is an exception.</p>

		<p>Dyson was the one, near the end, who brought up the specific case of a black being attacked by whites but when Patrick Buchanan countered with the incredibly horrifying statistics of black-against-white violent crime that&rsquo;s when Dyson started to talk over Buchanan, attempting to drown out facts that are undeniable. Perhaps these facts and this behaviour are the reason for a lack of dialogue. Blacks are bullies but Buchanan is not a man who will be easily bullied.</p>

		<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>The black student who couldn&rsquo;t make the grade FINALLY dropped out of class.  One of her white buddies called her to see why she was running late to class.  Her response was that she was offered a job in another medical field and that they were going to train her and stated what she would be making which is a good dollar for this area.   What the stupid idiot didn&rsquo;t realize was that the job she claims to have been hired for, requires that you already have a certification in the class she failed out of.   So, obviously, it was just a BIG LIE.  Boy are we glad she is GONE.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I am the biggest fan of Blacks, but your story sounds very suspect. As somoeone who taught at a regional state university for 30 years, most students, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian etc&hellip; do not make a ruckus in class, especially if they do not know what they are talking about or are unsure of the material. </p>
<p>If anything, they are more likely to be very quiet, sit in the back, keep their heads down and take notes. They usually will not ask questions either. Rather, it is the students who are well prepared and knowlegable who tend to engage in class discussion. They also tend to sit in the front on the class or in the first three rows. The student in question that you are talking about probably either left school period, transferred to another insitution or changed majors. The fact is that no reputable employers would have hired any person in such a technical related field without a college degree.</p>
<p>For some reason, it seems that every now and then we get some posters who tend to exaggerate or fabricate stories in an effort to satisfy some need of theirs or vent some frustrations. My apologies to you if you story is accurate, however it does not seem to pass the reality test. </p>
<p>One final note, while Jamal&rsquo;s comment was juvenile and ignorant, telling people to &#8220;go back to Africa&#8221; in big, bold print is hardly constructive, it&rsquo;s old school, outmoded rhetoric, and it does nothing but give our critics ammunition to portray us as a bunch of insane, crazed bigots who are deeply mired in the past.</p>

<p>Very sound advice Soprano Fan!</p>
<p>Glad you enjoyed my original post and thanks for very succinctly reaffirming, one of my basic philosophies of life. Personal Apartheid and hyperactive-vigilance with the blacks, really is a must.</p>
<p>When I still lived in Detroit, I made a point of never going into the city unless I had to. At age 22, the year 1994, I made the mistake of listening to some friends and going to an auto show at Cobo Hall; we all almost got shot, at that extravaganza of blacks on their rampages.</p>
<p>A cheap lesson, and one I never, ever, will forget!</p>
<p>All the best to you Soprano Fan,</p>

<p>I cannot understand why you would question the veracity of CY&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>She is probably correct.</p>
<p>As someone who also attended a community college, I can attest first hand to attending classes with just such a student. Also, it IS entirely possible this student did seek and gain employment as a nurses aide, phlebotomist or some similar type employment which does not require a traditional 4 year degree, but does require certification.  (These type of occupations are often taught under the Continuing Ed dept. and are frequented by black students.)</p>

Pat Buchanan is either totally blind to race (as many so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; really are) and only concerned with religious or economic issues (which are permissible),  or else  he is carefully dancing around the entire dangerous subject of race.  It is a hot potato. It is political poison.</p>
<p>Hard to tell which he&rsquo;s doing, but one thing is for sure:  if he came out openly with a clear racial policy, his respected  position as a national figure and his air time on the media would vanish in an instant, and he would become another nobody   &mdash;    reviled, forgotten, and never seen or heard in the public forum again.  </p>
<p>He would be regarded with shock and horror, and denounced by all &#8220;reputable&#8221; politicians and media figures as at least morally defective or even mentally ill. Perhaps the kinder ones would try to excuse him by saying he had merely gone senile. (His age would allow that saving excuse.)  At any rate, he and his opinions would be dismissed as no longer worth hearing.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens to those wicked heretics called &#8220;racists&#8221; in our new multi-cultural USA.  If you disagree with the New York Times-Harvard axis who are now in full control, you are not sent to the gulag or burned at the stake; you are merely pitied as mentally-ill and  quietly forgotten.</p>

		<p>For years I just thought Buchanan was a hopelessly backward &#8220;conservative.&#8221; The MSM did its usual number on him, I guess, misrepresenting him. But now I&rsquo;m in awe of him  &mdash;  that he can, at his age, respond so cogently and to the point to this motor-mouth who just kept repeating the usual cliches about how no one can face the problem of race. This whole thing was hilarious  &mdash;  Dyson proving that is indeed blacks who can&rsquo;t face it.</p>

		<p>Buchanan is a real clever man, and a good writer.  If you can, read his autobiography of his youth, &#8220;Right From the Beginning&#8221;.  Even some liberals praised it as a good story, well told.  <br>
     I don&rsquo;t doubt that he knows everything that we do, but knows how much he can get away with saying in public.  Sometimes he has hinted coyly at some forbidden truth, goading his enemies to spill the beans themselves, while standing back and saying, &#8220;I never said that, you did&#8221;.  He is not Richard the Lionheart, but Niccolo Machiavelli.  So what, how many posters here have OBAMA BACK TO AFRICA stickers on our cars?  He&rsquo;s on our side and his words get a lot more exposure than Jared Taylor&rsquo;s. </p>
