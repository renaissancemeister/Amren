<h1>Immigration Is Hot-Ticket Item for Texas Legislature</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcus Funk, Dallas Morning News, February 16, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Jim Jackson of Dallas wants to declare English the official language of Texas and require all government employees  &mdash;  from high-ranking officers to park rangers  &mdash;  to prove citizenship or legal residency.</p>
<p>To Jackson, a Republican, it makes perfect sense: &#8220;If you&rsquo;re going to have a law, then the first people that ought to obey the law is government.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, 35 bills aimed at illegal immigrants have been filed in the Legislature. Lawmakers say that for most, the future is uncertain at best. But because they are poised to stir passions, the bills serve as a distraction from traditional fiscal priorities  &mdash;  just as they did two years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most opponents also point out that immigration is a federal issue, and most legislators say Congress should handle it  &mdash;  Texas has a budget to pass, jobs to create and public schools to monitor, all in less than five months.</p>
<p>Many of this year&rsquo;s bills are unsuccessful repeats from the last session, when only three immigration bills  &mdash;  out of 72  &mdash;  ultimately passed. Supporters acknowledge that most were kept at arm&rsquo;s length even by devout conservatives such as former House Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland, who felt they belonged in Congress. And the measures face even longer odds under a moderate speaker and a House that is almost evenly divided now among Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But bipartisan proponents say they hope state action will spark greater federal efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t just sit back and say, &#8216;Well, it&rsquo;s the federal government&rsquo;s business,&rsquo; and hope that someday they will step up and help us out,&#8221; said Rep. Betty Brown, R-Terrell. &#8220;We have to do the best we can to try to get our border under control, or at least protect our citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even the GOP is divided. While some Republicans embrace strong immigration enforcement, others worry about opposition from the pro-business groups that have traditionally been their backers. Others still are influenced by demographic shifts. Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic group in Texas, and lawmakers such as Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, say many feel the rhetoric has become anti-Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like-minded conservatives also dispute the allegations of racism. They argue that many Hispanics vote for Republicans promising fair wages and safe borders, and that national security is a universal concern. &#8220;I think if we handle it properly, I&rsquo;m not sure we should have that much to argue over,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;I think most Hispanics want to follow the law, and I think we&rsquo;re OK when we don&rsquo;t make it about race and heritage. It shouldn&rsquo;t be, on either side.&#8221;<br>

<p>It is the fastest growing precisely BECAUSE of illegal aliens!!<br>

			<p>&gt;also point out that immigration is a federal issue,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the Feds say. And then they refuse to police the border and arrest the border patrol who do their job! Isn&rsquo;t government corruption a wonderful thing?</p>
<p>America has been on a steady downhill slide every since lincoln the dictator won his war against freedom.</p>

			<p>I live in Texas and have for years. The Democratic Party in Texas is mostly Hispanic, the few whites in the Democratic Party in Texas are either ACORN radical liberals or Obama-maniacs.</p>
<p>They have managed to tighten up on the driver&rsquo;s licenses and squeeze out the illegal aliens from getting photo-IDs with little or no documentation. That has been very good.</p>
<p>There are many things that are a Federal matter. It is a Federal crime to rob a bank or a post office, but there is no one who suggests that local police should not be called when one occurs. National defense is a purely Federal matter, yet half the troops in Iraq are state National Guard units. When Mexican troops cross over the border armed to the teeth, local Texas sheriffs are the first line of defense to this invasion. Where is the Federal presence on the border? About twenty miles from the border, there is a checkpoint on the highway of guys with guns. They ask if you are an American citizen, but they do not search or ask for identification.</p>
<p>Can the invasion be stopped in Texas? Sure! Just look the other way and we will have them out of here in a few days.<br>

			<p>Our only hope is that the unfolding economic crash changes the political winds down here. Our &#8220;conservative&#8221; Texas Governor, Rick Perry OPPOSES such common sense measures as the border fence and denying birthright citizenship to the US born children of illegal aliens (aka anchor babies). Thus, I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope our RINO Governor will do what is right.</p>
<p>More ominously, whites have already dropped below 50% of the Texas population according to the US census-and that&rsquo;s counting middle easterners, north Africans, Turks, etc as &#8220;white&#8221;. </p>
<p>https://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html</p>
<p>Worse still, the Texas Education Agency reports 130,000 fewer white children than 10 years ago. Meanwhile, &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are now 50.2% of ALL first graders in Texas public schools-with a whoping 1/4 of them the children of illegal aliens.</p>

			<p>The only way to stop this whining about racism is to tell these crybabies that it is they who are the racists, not whites, because they work constantly tring to get their own kind into this country, and once they&rsquo;re here, all they concern themselves with are matters directly related to their own tribesmen.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t hear that of course because it just isn&rsquo;t the white leaders who are cowards, it&rsquo;s the general white public who is spineless wimps themselves.  The&rsquo;re going to get what they deserve, which is a country where they&rsquo;ll either have to move to a remote area or relocate overseas somewhere where the white percentage is greater.</p>
<p>Nothing will improve unless the country goes into survival mode and even then a good number of whites will be apologizing and wanting to hug someone non-white.  If there is a race of people who has such a large number of wimps I&rsquo;d like to see it.</p>

			<p>The Obama administration is going to help on the illegal immigration problem.  They are going to allow the most effective tool in the box to expire..That is the E-VERIFY program that is 99.6% effective.  <br>
So this apparently indicates to the good REPUBS in the legislature that Obama and the feds will handle the problem???????</p>

			<p>Memphomaniac:</p>
<p>It is because the Federal government has mostly removed immigration from the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies underneath it (states, localities).  I say &#8220;mostly&#8221; because there is 287g (?), which somewhat allows for it.  The article here in AR today about Joe Arpaio is an example, his Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has that 287g authorization, but the libs want to take it away from him because he hasn&rsquo;t rounded up enough illegal Norwegians in the Valley.  (Duh.)  It just so happens Obama is there today blabbering on about home foreclosures (giving illegal alien cherry pickers $720,000 mortgages and wonder why they can&rsquo;t make the payments, Duh).  Plus the SPLC has come out against Arpaio, calling him a &#8220;hater.&#8221;  It seems like that city and state are getting it from all directions.</p>
<p>The National Guards are legally appendages of the U.S. Armed Forces.  They&rsquo;re trained by them and paid by them.  The only thing &#8220;state&#8221; about them is that the Federal government so graciously gives State Governors temporary custody of their use, when they&rsquo;re not being used for anything else.  I wish the states did have their own armed forces, though, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
