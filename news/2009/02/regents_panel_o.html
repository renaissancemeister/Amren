			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patricia Yollin, San Francisco Chronicle, February 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A lot more young people will have a shot at getting into the University of California under new eligibility rules, approved by a UC Board of Regents committee on Wednesday, that represent the most sweeping changes in admission standards in almost 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that it will be more diverse and more fair,&#8221; said UC President Mark Yudof.</p>
<p>The full board is expected to approve these changes today:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  SAT subject tests would no longer be necessary.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The pool of applicants who would be considered would widen, but the number guaranteed entry into one of the university&rsquo;s nine undergraduate campuses would shrink.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The top 9 percent of high school graduates statewide would be assured entry, compared with 12.5 percent previously, as well as those in the top 9 percent of their graduating class  &mdash;  up from 4 percent in the past.</p>
<p>Taken together, the two groups would constitute 10.1 percent of California&rsquo;s graduating class, based on projections by the university.</p>
<p>The revised requirements would affect the freshman class of 2012.</p>
<p>The changes would allow high school students to be considered  &mdash;  and granted a full review of their application  &mdash;  who complete by the end of junior year at least 11 of 15 college prep courses required by UC, achieve a weighted 3.0 grade-point average and take either the ACT Plus Writing or SAT Reasoning Test.</p>
<p>UC was the only public education system in the country that made students take two SAT subject tests. The result: 22,000 high school graduates in California who otherwise would have been eligible were disqualified in 2007 from applying to the university.</p>
<p><b>Figures based on &#8216;07 data</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some people saw the shift  &mdash;  endorsed by the University of California Student Association  &mdash;  as a way to get around Proposition 209, which was approved by voters in 1996 and ended race- and gender-based anti-discrimination programs in state, county and city hiring, contracting and school admissions.</p>
<p>Yudof said he supported affirmative action but would obey Prop. 209 because it is the law. He was sure the new rules would increase diversity, but said it was too early to know the specific impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the changes dominated the meeting, few members of the public addressed them. Most, instead, were angry about soon having to contribute to their retirement fund without being represented on the pension board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One protester was Ellie Corley, 72, an administrative assistant in the UC controller&rsquo;s office who has worked at the university for 33 years and makes $35,000 a year.</p>
<p>She got laid off in January and will leave in March.</p>
<p>&#8220;The university talks about equity and inclusion,&#8221; Corley said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never seen it.&#8221;<br>

			<p>California, and its school-system, were rightly written off as total losses many years ago. </p>
<p>Instead of trying to fix California, or worrying over what liberal nonsense (such as these new rules) Californians are embracing now, true patriotic Americans who want to protect our borders, our culture, and our values should instead point to it as a perfect example of the horrors that can engulf a State when open-borders, easy immigration, and rampant liberalism take a firm hold. The message should be: &#8216;California- Never let it happen again.&rsquo;</p>

			<p>Whoever this &#8220;Yudof&#8221; is who claims that the UC system will obey the law on Prop 209 must think we&rsquo;re stupid.  I think that there have been a lot of people in the UC system who have been working for years to come up with an admissions plan that is square with the letter of the law but violates the spirit, in that it&rsquo;s not affirmative action de jure but it is de facto.</p>

			<p>Oh boy. Top 9% in some of LA&rsquo;s high schools. That means you can read Goodnight Moon.</p>

This is an imitation of the system they came up with in Texas.</p>
<p>It hinges on a trick:<br>
(a) Being at the top of some high schools requires much less talent than beeing at the top of other high schools. <br>
(b) When a high schools is almost all minorities, the top 9% (or any percentage) will almost definitely be minorities. They might be barely able to read, but they will still be in the top 9%.</p>

			<p>A large number of these revelations are probably incidence of racism, against whites. Even acts of racism against whites are seen as racism against people of color. Racism really does hurt the perpetrator&hellip;</p>

<p>does &#8216;young people&rsquo; mean black? Because a lot of &#8216;young people who are smart, worked hard and got good grades and board scores won&rsquo;t be &#8216;getting a shot&rsquo;</p>

			<p>The racial dispossesson of Ntive Born White Americans continues a pace. Always frame the presumed benefits of post-1965 hispanic,african,asian and muslim in terms of Native Born White American interests. Is it in the interests of Native Born White Americans to be reduced to a racial minority in California and the nation as whole? Obviously not.</p>
<p>For anyone who goes out to publicly debate immigration, the debate should begin and end with this question and answer. </p>
<p>I despise the liberal even handedness of numbersusa.com</p>

			<p>  The state of Kalifornia is the poster child of failure. Due to lax immigration, liberal politics, and affirmative action; the state is going down the tubes very, very quickly. The governor is begging the feds for more money. I am afraid Kalifornia is lost. I really don&rsquo;t think it could be saved. Let&rsquo;s be honest, it would cost far too much to try and save Kalifornia from itself and the results would be inconclusive at best. It is time to cut our losses and let Mexico have it. Maybe we can save the rest of the west. I hope so, but Kalifornia is too far gone. In medical terms, it has flat-lined. The amount of money needed to keep Kalifornia afloat deems it a total loss. Too bad, when it was California, it was a beautiful state. The past 44+ years of unregulated socialism/communism has destroyed any vestiges of the former state. It is now a landfill, at least the southern half of the state. Crime, drugs, disease, unemployment, affirmative action, illegal immigration, have all taken a fatal toll on this once great state. It really is the poster child of disaster. The rest of the country can look at it and see where not to go.</p>

			<p>Roller, 10:29 AM on February6 is actually understating the case, hard as it is to believe. California is so disfuntional, that where it once stood as the eight largest economic power in the world, it now has the lowest bond rating of any state in the United States. If California wants to borrow money, which it does and a lot of it, it will have to pay the highest interest rate, so little faith have the banks in California. I don&rsquo;t know about letting Mexico have it, but I know one thing, unless the Democratic Party is completely destroyed in California as a political force, then Roller is right, it&rsquo;s doomed for good.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Proposition 209, which was approved by voters in 1996 and ended race- and gender-based anti-discrimination programs &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>Notice how the preface &#8220;anti-&#8221; completely reverses the actual purpose of the 1996 vote, which was to end race- and gender-based discrimination.</p>
<p>Nice media bias there.<br>

			<p>The UC system never obeyed Prop 209.  </p>
<p>For the first 10 years they simply discriminated against whites by accepting somewhat less qualified asians on the basis of the &#8220;poor, poor pitiful me&#8221; essay included in the application packet.</p>
<p>Now they are back to accepting grossly, grossly unqualified hispanics and blacks instead of superbly qualified whites.</p>
<p>Prop 209 was never, never enforced in California.  So don&rsquo;t get your hopes up about those anti affirmative action propositions on the ballots of many states.</p>
<p>Remember, federal law trumps state law and federal law mandates discrimination against whites backed up by the EEOC and Departments of Education and Justice gestapos.</p>
<p>California is already part of the third world.  For 150 years the Colleges and Universities of California made their reputation because of their white male professors and researchers. </p>
<p>They have banned white male researchers and profs in favor of unqualified non whites and vicious feminazis.  Soon the UC system will be the equivalent of the University of Paraguay.</p>
<p>All I can do is sit back and enjoy the self destruction of CAlifornia.</p>

			<p>BAck in the 1950&rsquo;s when California was about 90 percent white and 10 percent black and asian, the K-12 system was always in the top 5 of the entire country.  </p>
<p>By the 1980&rsquo;s California always came in either 48 or 49 of the 50 states.</p>
<p>As the K-12 system went, so will the University system.</p>
<p>Who cares? Just as nothing can save corrupt Mexico, nothing can save California.</p>
<p>We whites created working class paradise.  The liberals and non whites destroyed intin a mere 20 year, 1970 to 1990. </p>
