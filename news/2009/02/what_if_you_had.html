<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7879169.stm">What If You Had a Racist Friend?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What do you say when a friend or colleague utters a remark that could be regarded as racist? Whether or not Carol Thatcher&rsquo;s use of the word &#8220;golliwog&#8221; was racist, comedian Jo Brand found it so offensive she walked out of the room.</p>
<p>It is an awkward conversation to have. One minute you are chatting away to an associate when out of nowhere they make a comment you find offensive. Knowing what to say in response, and how to behave towards them in future is not simple. So, what to do about it?</p>
<p>The reaction of comedian Jo Brand to just such a situation led to a slew of headlines last week. After an edition of the BBC&rsquo;s One Show, in which Brand had appeared, she was unwinding with crew members who included Carol Thatcher  &mdash;  an occasional reporter for the programme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reported that Brand stormed out of the room after challenging Thatcher.</p>
<p>The flood of complaints over the decision to sack Thatcher from the show suggests that many think Brand&rsquo;s reaction, and the BBC&rsquo;s later response, was over the top. Nevertheless, many others will have found themselves in a similar quandary at some time in their life  &mdash;  unsure how to challenge an offensive remark, if at all.</p>
<p>One such person is Jerry Dammers, once the lead songwriter in the 1980s pop group The Specials and then The Special AKA. It was under this second incarnation that Dammers performed one of his best-known songs, Racist Friend.</p>
<p><b>Cut him loose</b></p>
<p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Broadcasting House, Dammers says the song was his way of dealing with a friend who &#8220;just suddenly used to come out with racist comments&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apart from that he was a really nice guy  &mdash;  it was just really out of character. It didn&rsquo;t make any sense,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Apart from penning the song, Dammers also stopped seeing this &#8220;friend&#8221;  &mdash;  an approach echoed in the song&rsquo;s chorus: &#8220;If you have a racist friend/ Now is the time, now is the time/ For your friendship to end.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for Dammers, who confesses he is &#8220;not a confrontational person&#8221;, the song was substitute for a more direct challenge. He never actually got to tell the person why he had broken off contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;He actually died a few years ago. I didn&rsquo;t see him for years and years afterwards. When I heard that he&rsquo;d died, I felt terrible that I hadn&rsquo;t told him that the song was about him, and why I&rsquo;d cut myself off from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>This tactic might work sometimes, but for others the idea of cutting adrift someone dear to them is understandably extreme.</p>
<p>Professor Roger Crisp, fellow of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, says in the case of friends you should make the most of your relationship with them to try to change their views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some philosophers have had some pretty implausible views on friendship. Aristotle thought that only virtuous people could be friends. A racist couldn&rsquo;t be your friend according to him.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Us and them&#8221;</b></p>
<p>But musician Tom Robinson, who, like Dammers, was known for his activism, is wary of the motives of so-called racist friends. When someone shares a racist remark with you, it is a form of conspiracy, says Robinson; a way of them seeing it as &#8220;us&#8221; talking about &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are involving you, trying to make you collude by saying it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if the associate in question has very extreme views then it would seem unlikely a firm friendship could have been formed without this opinion having been apparent early on and causing difficulties.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the person is a virulent racist, disliking black people perhaps, then there is a difficulty for the non-racist friend,&#8221; says Professor Crisp. &#8220;Then you think &#8216;imagine I was black&rsquo; then this person wouldn&rsquo;t like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although racism in the UK is less overt than it once was, it still exists. People&rsquo;s views are shaped by those around us, and those that we are aware of  &mdash;  celebrities, politicians and others in the public eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;A minor racist joke or comment that seems innocuous filters down, especially if it&rsquo;s made by a powerful person. It goes much further and influences much more people,&#8221; says Dammers.</p>
<p>There is no obvious response to hearing a friend&rsquo;s racist comments, but from Jerry Dammers&rsquo; experience it is a good idea to share your feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&rsquo;t confront it, you will regret it, I can assure you that much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Except Aristotle was the &#8220;philosopher of common sense&#8221;. He had enough sense to know &#8220;racism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t immoral, it&rsquo;s human nature.<br>

			<p>This is how the multicults operate.  They get the followers to attack racists on all fronts, by taking their jobs, ostracizing them from their friends and girlfriends/boyfriends/spouses etc.  A lot of white people do recognize the truth of things but are simply afraid of losing their social contacts and their job.  This is intimidation, pure and simple, and it is what we&rsquo;re up against.</p>
<p>I read something similar to this, a poll asking if you found out your spouse was racist, would you leave them.  Half of the people said yes.  Disgusting. </p>

			<p>After reading this I would have to assume only white people can (and do) say things that are offensive. Why is it people of color can&rsquo;t say anything offensive, and that people use the term &#8216;redneck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in order to prove to everyone how enlightened they are?</p>

<p>Can they just outlaw two white people talking to each other? Or do white people pretty much not really talk to each other as it is?</p>

			<p>  I will admit that I am a racialist, I believe in my people first and foremost, as would any mentally healthy person. All my friends are white, and they will stay white. They have no problem with me being a racialist. I have no use what-so-ever for ANYBODY outside my race. My live in just fine. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;Some philosophers have had some pretty implausible views on friendship. Aristotle thought that only virtuous people could be friends. A racist couldn&rsquo;t be your friend according to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What rubbish.  Aristotle understood diversity better than any of these dopes.  Aristotle taught that love, affection, and trust among citizens is predicated upon them sharing a language, values, and culture.  Read Politics.  Where does Aristotle praise anything resembling the multi-cultural, cosmopolitan society these clowns praise?  I can understand why the left-wing educational establishment fails to encourage the study of latin or classics in public schools.  God forbid any material be introduced students which describes a common heritage among whites.  Contrary to popular belief, ignorance more likely leads to the uncritical acceptance of an oft repeated idea, not the other way around.  </p>
<p>As for the divide and conquer tactic devised to get me to cut loose my &#8220;racist&#8221; friends - no thanks.  Old friends are often irreplaceable, as life is too short to find many new ones.  </p>

<p>I would do what Ms. Brand did:<br>
Despite the fact that this was a <i>private conversation</i>, presumably held with some pretext to <i>confidentiality</i> report it to my superiors - until the Thought Police are up and running.</p>
<p><i>Aristotle thought that only virtuous people could be friends. A racist couldn&rsquo;t be your friend according to him.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So&hellip;did Aristotle find &#8220;racism&#8221; distasteful, or are we applying 21st Century beliefs to ancient Greek ones?</p>

			<p>Well since I consider all non-whites to racist I guess I would have to avoid being friend with anyone who was not white. See problem solved.Wait by saying that I think all non-whites are racist is it not a racist thing to say.</p>

			<p>I would never reject one of my liberal friends simply because they were anti-racist.  One need not focus on our disagreements.  How will they ever come around if good Rightists don&rsquo;t bring them around?</p>
<p>Dignified people can discuss their views without being labelled &#8220;racists.&#8221;  If what I&rsquo;m saying is logically defensible and not simply empty insult, then there&rsquo;s no reason to stop being my friend.</p>
<p>There is no place for more &#8220;colorful&#8221; jokes around your liberal friends.  Save them for the Right time.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Whether or not Carol Thatcher&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;golliwog&rdquo; was racist, comedian Jo Brand found it so offensive she walked out of the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming she left to go see her analyst, because no one who is not afflicted with a mental disorder would do that.</p>
<p>A recent statement by a top psychiatrist declared that 41 million Americans are beset with some form of mental illness to one degree or another.  Is it any wonder when nowadays from cradle to grave the population is hammered 1984 style everywhere to regard diversity as a sacred religion, more important than all other things?</p>
<p>I read a post from another site from a woman that said: &#8220;From the time I get up every morning to the time I go to bed, my one goal is to fight racism wherever it exists.&#8221;  Such a poor miguided, miserable fool.</p>
<p>Is this mindset as dangerous as a sect or a cult?  Without doubt it is.  Was communism or Nazism more prevalent and as intense among true believers than this type of racial perversion?  I think not. </p>
<p>The people afflicted like the one in this story have serious mental problems, and they should be avoided.  But if that isn&rsquo;t possible what they do and say should be completely ignored the same as the ravings and ludicrous behavior from any other lunatic.</p>

			<p>Carol Thatcher is a real lady and in the UK, golliwogs are looked upon as loved dolls as many midle-aged women had them when they were children before the current crazy political correctness became the norm.</p>
<p>Jo Brand is a foul-mouthed fat woman (she boasts about her obesity on stage) who uses on stage such words as f&hellip;, c&hellip; and other words that shock us older UK citizens who when young if we ever dared to use such words would get a clip around the ear from parents or other nearby adults for using such language in public.  I will never watch her again for her treachery.  Many British expats living here in Spain (retired) are ashamed to be British when they see what is happening in their country.</p>
<p>But the pendulum is about to swing back the other way soon.</p>

			<p> Notice the unwarranted assumptions made here: Remarks which conflict with political correctness are, by definition, &#8220;racist&#8221; and therefore &#8220;evil&#8221;; Aristotle would define a &#8220;virtuous person&#8221; as someone who holds only such politically correct views on race; friends can&rsquo;t be friends without agreeing on everything   &mdash;   especially a definition of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p> And by the way, who defines that word, and how? In such news stories written by people of an obviously liberal persuasion, the word &#8220;racism&#8221; is always bandied about as if everyone reading the article knows exactly what it means, and that it is simply another word for &#8220;evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those who understand the importance of race should be trying to educate the brain dead ones who are so brainwashed that they&rsquo;re walking happily to their own extinction.</p>
<p>And, if you can&rsquo;t break through to the brain dead ones to deprogram them from their neurotic aracialness, then you should break off the friendly relationship.</p>

			<p>Follow Comrades:</p>
<p>You are not to associate with anyone expressing or privately holding reactionary views or any opinion contrary to the Revolution.  Ideology must trump all bonds of friendship.  Your private lives are Political - everything is Political.  If your friends, family members or co-workers express anti-Revolutionary views, your job is to quietly distance yourself and report them to the proper Authorities.  The character of a man or women is to be determined strictly by their adherence to Revolutionary Principles.  Whether a man or woman is a &#8220;good&#8221; husband, wife, son, daughter, friend or worker is of no consequence.  This is likely only a veneer hiding reactionary opinions.  What must matter to you above all else is Correct Opinion on Revolutionary Principles and adherence to the Ideology of Anti-Discrimination.  Act Now!  Take a stand, Comrades, and sever your ties with the remnants of Reaction.  This is your Duty.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A racist couldn&rsquo;t be your friend according to him [Aristotle].&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may be the single stupidest sentence every republished on AR. I will donate $1,000 to the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza if anyone can point out so much as a mention of &#8220;racism&#8221; in any authentic work of Aristotle. There&rsquo;s little more appalling than ignorance allied with preening leftist politics.</p>

These people will twist and contort any sound reasoning to fit a square peg into a round hole. When the facts don&rsquo;t fit, rewrite the facts.</p>
<p>Aristotle was an intelligent man. He would likely have recognized the differences between peoples. I suspect it&rsquo;s unlikely he would have considered seeing people as being different as evil or immoral.</p>
<p>As for Carol Thatcher, as Oscar Wilde said, &#8216;if you don&rsquo;t have anything nice to say about someone, come and sit by me&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If anyone of my friends or family want to reject me for my &#8216;racist&rsquo; views, they&rsquo;re free to do so. Neither one of us would enjoy each others company and I won&rsquo;t lose sleep over the matter.</p>
<p>All us &#8216;rejects&rsquo; would be more than happy to live away from these people. Unfortunately, they demand to live with us. I only WISH they would leave us alone&hellip;</p>

			<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about Aristotle himself, but I do know that his mentor Plato believed in Eugenics (which, while not quite &#8220;racism&#8221;, is another politically incorrect and arguably related concept). </p>
<p>And the ancient Greeks in general considered most other peoples barbarians, just like so many other civilizations over the ages. They were most definitely racist by the standards the subversive crooks who own our media would like us to have. </p>
<p>The term &#8220;Racism&#8221; itself originated in France in the late 19th century. <br>
Ridiculous to assume Aristotle - or any other great thinker - would have shared liberal views on an issue that was pretty much unheard of until the post WWII propagandistic onslaught on the West. </p>

			<p>How is this different from life during the worst days of Communism in Russia?  For that matter, the article reminds me of what I&rsquo;ve read about the social climate during the Third Reich.  People were encouraged to denounce each other for any utterance that betrayed a mindset not totally conforming to the party line.  Many denounced friends and relatives for personal gain.  How is this different?  This whole article feels like something that would come out of a Stalinist or Nazi office of propaganda.</p>

			<p>In the 1960&rsquo;s, White men used to make jokes about the Chinese Political Correctness mania which was then rampant. Vast resources were expended to route out inCorrect  thought, not actions, just thoughts. Nothing that crazy could ever occur in any Western nation, or so most of us thought. Guess what! We were wrong!</p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s get rid of the PARADIGM altogether:</p>
<p>there are a wealth of opinions on racial difference, and  ALL the non-hating ones should be discussed openly without censorship and without labels like racist, race realist, etc.</p>
<p>I have shocked friends with my views, but I NEVER go on the defensive. I just brush off the accusation of racism and go on to SUBSTANCE.</p>
<p>Many people are dying for frank discussion, but are afraid. After going through the boring ritual of denoucning you, they may perk up and get curious about the FANTASTIC WEALTH of topics that are closeed off by censorship.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: Hateful and spiteful and degrading and insulting talk is and will always be just that, there is no excuse for it.</p>
<p>It may be protected by the 1st amendment to make an ass and a boor of yourself, but don&rsquo;t expect your enlightened friends to like it.</p>
<p>What amazes me is how &#8220;race realists&#8221; will spew the most vile stew of nastiness and then act AMAZED!!!! that no one can see they are just being &#8220;objective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks like a golliwog&#8221; or &#8220;Michelle looks like a monkey&#8221; are excellent ways to close off debate and offend any decent human being.</p>
<p>Start by cleaning up your own acts.</p>

			<p>What the liberals don&rsquo;t want you to think about or realize&hellip; the reality being a &#8220;racist&#8221; simply means you have rejected the liberal dogma and regained the right to think for yourself. That by observation and learning, you have formulated the conclusion minorities are EMPHATICALLY NOT as good, generally, as Whites. That they are an unfair burden dumped on White citizens, White taxpayers to support.</p>

			<p>Speaking of philosophers, it was Plato who once said that the beginning of wisdom starts with the definition of terms.  So, then, what is racism?  Let&rsquo;s define racism before we accuse people of it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What do you say when a friend or colleague utters a remark that could be regarded as racist? &#8220;</p>
<p>Like you say lets go for coffee into the middle of South Central LA.  Your friend says you can&rsquo;t because you are white.</p>
<p>&#8221; comedian Jo Brand found it so offensive she walked out of the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>But not to South Central.  Wonder why?</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an awkward conversation to have. One minute you are chatting away to an associate when out of nowhere they make a comment you find offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>You suggest going into the Muslim zone in Birmingham and are persistent.    Your friend is worried you mean it and really starts getting nervous and shouts at you that you are a PC fool and you will get killed if you go there.</p>
<p>Can the BBC PC explain how to deal with this situation?</p>

I personally refuse to acknowledge or use the terms &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;racism&rsquo;.  They were coined and promulgated by a communist, Trotsky, intentionally to shut down any discussion of the true nature of communism  &mdash;  that it was being brutally imposed on the Russian people by an alien ethnic group.  </p>
<p>When you use those terms, or allow anyone in your presence to use them without challenge, you are implicitly agreeing to their validity and power.  &#8216;Racism&rsquo; is a bogeyman that doesn&rsquo;t exist unless you agree that it does, but if you do, game over  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s no way out of the argument.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;But musician Tom Robinson, who, like Dammers, was known for his activism, is wary of the motives of so-called racist friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The musician, Tom Robinson, is a dyed-in-the-wool Socialist.  His albums have all kinds of communist iconography printed on them.  What a shock that he&rsquo;s a spokesman for political correctness.</p>

			<p>Since the PC is always directed at whites, then we must assume these enforcers of PC are anti-white and not anti-racist as they proclaim.  If anyone would use that to launch a counter attack after a Mau Mauing they would probably save themselves.</p>

			<p>Guess it all depends on what you consider &#8220;racism&#8221; to be. My definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; is vastly different from the average brainwashed politically correct White person.</p>

			<p>What I find is, if you couch your race realism in &#8220;moderate&#8221; language, you can get away with what would otherwise be considered &#8220;racist&#8221; statements. The horrible bogeyman that the left-wingers have built around the word &#8220;racist&#8221; can actually work in our favor. The left has painted such a horrible image of &#8220;racists&#8221; that I suspect most people think of &#8220;racists&#8221; as sporting horns and pointed teeth, or at least spewing out the &#8220;n-word&#8221; a lot and advocating lynchings. Therefore, if you avoid intemperate language, you can get away with saying a lot in private that would get you hounded out of a job by the media if you were to say it in public. </p>
<p>For example, &#8220;That area is turning black, you want to stay away from there&#8221; would most certainly get you tarred and feathered by the MSM if you said it as a public figure, but you can say it in private and you will find that most whites will agree with you, and not think you are a racist at all.</p>

			<p><em>&ldquo;If the person is a virulent racist, disliking black people perhaps, then there is a difficulty for the non-racist friend,&rdquo; says Professor Crisp. &ldquo;Then you think &lsquo;imagine I was black&rsquo; then this person wouldn&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>What utter nonsense! It&rsquo;s at the point now where you cannot have a personal and original thought without the thought police storming through the ramparts of your individualism. I agree whole heartedly with B J Deller. Golliwogs were a black version of the raggedy Anne dolls and were part of the Noddy series of childrens books. What is so offensive about a doll? Who cares what Jo Brand thinks anyway? She is, &#8220;a foul-mouthed fat woman,&#8221; to quote Deller, who seems to think her liberal, Marxist multicult rhetoric is smart and witty.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Aristotle thought that only virtuous people could be friends. A racist couldn&rsquo;t be your friend according to him&#8221;</p>
<p>Racial survival is &#8220;virtuous&#8221;. A love of ones own tribe is &#8220;virtuous&#8221;. Accepting facts is &#8220;virtuous&#8221;. Rejecting truth and embracing lies is shameful and despicable. </p>

			<p>On the contrary, I wouldn&rsquo;t want a friend who was NOT a race-realist.  The &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; crowd consists of the most arrogant, narcissistic, self-deluded folks I&rsquo;ve ever met.  They&rsquo;re hard enough to tolerate even casually - there&rsquo;s no way on earth I&rsquo;d go out of my way to socialize with one or allow one into my home.</p>

			<p>Lol.  Everyone I befriend ends up a racist.  Scratch a man and you find a racist.  It&rsquo;s like shooting fish in a barrel; a few weeks of logic and facts, and it&rsquo;s curtains for the homogeneous diversity and intolerant tolerance (AKA PC AKA liberalism AKA progressivism).</p>

			<p>Notice how the politically correct suffer from a serious lack of intellectual curiousity.  Whenever a friend of mine has a contrary or bizarre opinion, I always ask them &#8220;Why..?&#8221;   &mdash;   and if their answer is coherent, I learn a little more about the world.  </p>
<p>I wish I could have a frank discussion about race with the white folks I work with, but we&rsquo;re all obliged to dance carefully around the issue, in order to keep our jobs. Just one more tiny thing to be seethingly resentful about.</p>

<p>Me too, regardless of color or ethnicity, in moments of candor, all people, even unintentionally, will admit to their &#8216;racial realism&rsquo;  I allow them to be themselves, even Black people.  As &#8216;Drew&rsquo; wrote above, &#8216;racism&rsquo; is simply a Marxist canard for anyone who disagrees with their destructive agenda.<br>

			<p>Instead of &#8220;not being friends with a racist&#8221;, wouldn&rsquo;t a true liberal be intersted and ask why a &#8220;racist&#8221; has the opinions and views they do about certain groups of people?</p>

			<p>If &#8220;racist&#8221; means one who realizes that races are different and wants to keep them that way, then we need millions more like that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t accept any as friends who do not think that way.</p>

			<p>Aristotle made observations on the peoples he knew, seeing that the Egyptians produced far more children than the Greeks but he never suggested that the Greeks take in vast numbers of foreigners as the multiculturalists do. He opined that &#8216;the character of the citizens should be a mean between that of the Asiatics and that of the northern races: intelligence and high spirit should be harmoniously blended as they are in some Greek races&rsquo;. He said &#8216;slavery is natural&rsquo; and defended it, which noone today outside the Muslim world would do.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that the writer in this report is a professor of philosophy as he takes one reference from Aristotle to justify in a specious way his belief in multiracialism.He seems to fall into logical error by appealing to the authority of a great philosopher (e.g.&rsquo;Einstein said X (on a subject outside his discipline), therefore X must be true). This man took Aristotle out of context, what would he make of the philosopher&rsquo;s  statement &#8216;slavery is natural&rsquo;?</p>
