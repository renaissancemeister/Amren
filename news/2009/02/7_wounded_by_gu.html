<h1>7 Wounded by Gunfire on Mardi Gras Parade Route</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Kunzelman, AP, February 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The shootings of seven people, including a toddler, marred Fat Tuesday partying as ear-piercing gunfire sent revelers ducking for cover and brought Mardi Gras&rsquo; final stream of truck floats to a horrifying halt.</p>
<p>The 20-month-old child was grazed by a bullet and wasn&rsquo;t seriously injured. Two suspects were in custody, police said.</p>
<p>Gunshots erupted near the Garden District about 1:40 p.m. as a stream of truck floats passed by after the last major parade, Rex, had ended. Thousands of people partied in the streets on the last day of Carnival before the violence broke out along the oak-lined Uptown streetcar line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police spokesman Bob Young said the victims  &mdash;  three men ages 50, 33 and 20, two young women ages 20 and 17, and a 15-year-old boy  &mdash;  were taken to area hospitals. Young said the 20-month-old baby was grazed by a bullet and not seriously hurt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police believe the victims were bystanders hit at random, though a motive for the shooting hasn&rsquo;t been determined, Valencia said. Their names weren&rsquo;t released.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m off to Afghanistan this summer. Damn, this is more dangerous than Afghanistan,&#8221; said [Dr. Jim] Parry, an Air Force reservist.</p>
<p>Two men, 19-year-old Mark Brooks and 18-year-old Louis Lazone, both of New Orleans, were each booked with seven counts of attempted first-degree murder. Brooks also faces a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Young said. It was not immediately known if the men had attorneys.</p>
<p>Three weapons believed used in the shooting were recovered, Young said.</p>
<p>Two other shootings were reported in the midst of Mardi Gras celebrations. {snip}<br>

			<p>A few years ago, someone held up a sign in New Orleans that proclaimed the city to be &#8220;America&rsquo;s Baghdad.&#8221;  I thought that someone in Baghdad could hold up a sign reading &#8220;Iraq&rsquo;s New Orleans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the salient point of this story:  <i>Even in the obvious presence of police<i>, with at least six in the plain view of these thugs, they shot up at people anyway.  </i></i></p>
<p>Think about this when you hear a lib Democrat mouth off about how we need the Federal government to pay for more police on the streets, to stop crime.  The black thugs are getting more and more brazen, (Gee, I wonder why?  Gee, I wonder who&rsquo;s been trying to tell you this all along that this would be a consequence of electing Obama), some have lost their fear of police.  And, Federally-funded local cops will have all sorts of civil rights handcuffs holding them back.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch version of this story showed a middle aged white man who had taken off his shirt to use it to heal the wounds of one of the victims (black).  Three and a half years ago, people like this victim would have shot at people like this good samaritan in the aftermath of Katrina.  Whoever this man is, he should realize that the more compassionate he is, the more likely it&rsquo;ll be that he is a victim of a violent crime at the hands of one of them.  What we call compassion they call chumps.<br>

			<p>Something very similar to this happened in the San Francisco Bay Area several years ago. Some black gangbangers fired a bunch of shots at each other, wounding about the same number of victims.They were caught, thanks to a very brave man who tailed them as they were trying to escape.One of them got 18 years of Federal prision time.</p>

<p>Should be good for 7 years or so in the pen&hellip;..No picture of these thugs. Makes a person wonder??? Coulda been white thugs? Or maybe a couple of visiting Eskimos? </p>

			<p>Were the shooters black? I don&rsquo;t mean that question as naively as it may sound. Note how there were no photos of the shooters. I did an internet search and saw no identifying photos or video evidence to say one way or the other. Of course, i&rsquo;m assuming they are black, but the MSM will never go out of its way to tell you so.</p>

			<p>Just wondering, were the people involved Japanese or were they of Scandanavian descent? As there was no mention of their backgrounds in the article I can&rsquo;t figure out who they might be, maybe somebody could venture a guess on this.</p>

			<p>Fear not. When the weather gets warmer, Chicago will start shooting up the place. We had a bad winter, so we had a slow start.<br>
   Note to any visitors: Stay away from any schools. They are the favorite target of gangster shooters.</p>

			<p>Only seven wounded? Wait until our annual blackfest in Notting Hill, London, UK, it too is called a carnival. We civilians are not permitted to own firearms in UK, even to defend our homes and property, but africans seem to have truck-loads. However, most blacks carry knives or machetes when attending these afro-carribean family friendly affairs. This year will have the added zest of the ongoing war between somalis and afghans who have &#8216;fled&rsquo; to UK as asylum seekers. We can stay safe at home and watch the mayhem on TV, we even have three police choppers beaming live close-up shots of the hooded &#8216;children&rsquo; in close fighting formation. Just one more reason to support the BNP and bring this disgusting alien affair to an end. I just saw the recently launched ANP on the web. No prizes for figuring out the acronym!</p>

			<p>If some mentally disturbed white youth had done this, it would be the biggest story in America right now.  I wonder why this story isn&rsquo;t getting very much coverage?</p>

			<p>Ah, the ineffable joys of living in a multicultural society. Just think how utterly dull and vapid Mardi Gras would be sans NOLA&rsquo;s Black culture.</p>

<p>I doubt they&rsquo;re really Phillies and Cardinals fans.  Methinks they shot at people wearing blue clothing.</p>

			<p>The controlled liberal governmedia will record this incident as &#8220;gun violence&#8221; and use the statistics to &#8220;prove&#8221; that we need to keep White people from owning Evil Guns.</p>
<p>There is never any such thing as <i>black</i> violence.  To suggest otherwise is Racism, and will not be tolerated.</p>
