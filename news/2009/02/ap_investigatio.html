<h1>AP Investigation: Banks Sought Foreign Workers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Bass and Rita Beamish, AP, February 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Major U.S. banks sought government permission to bring thousands of foreign workers into the country for high-paying jobs even as the system was melting down last year and Americans were getting laid off, according to an Associated Press review of visa applications.</p>
<p>The dozen banks now receiving the biggest rescue packages, totaling more than $150 billion, requested visas for more than 21,800 foreign workers over the past six years for positions that included senior vice presidents, corporate lawyers, junior investment analysts and human resources specialists. The average annual salary for those jobs was $90,721, nearly twice the median income for all American households.</p>
<p>As the economic collapse worsened last year  &mdash;  with huge numbers of bank employees laid off  &mdash;  the numbers of visas sought by the dozen banks in AP&rsquo;s analysis increased by nearly one-third, from 3,258 in the 2007 budget year to 4,163 in fiscal 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is unclear how many foreign workers the banks actually hired; the government does not release those details. The actual number is likely a fraction of the 21,800 foreign workers the banks sought to hire because the government only grants 85,000 such visas each year among all U.S. employers.</p>
<p>During the last three months of 2008, the largest banks that received taxpayer loans announced more than 100,000 layoffs. The number of foreign workers included among those laid off is unknown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Companies are required to pay foreign workers a prevailing wage based on the job&rsquo;s description. But they can use the lower end of government wage scales even for highly skilled workers; hire younger foreigners with lower salary demands; and hire foreigners with higher levels of education or advanced degrees for jobs for which similarly educated American workers would be considered overqualified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beyond seeking approval for visas from the government, banks that accepted federal bailout money also enlisted uncounted foreign workers, often in technology jobs, through intermediary companies known as &#8220;body shops.&#8221; Such businesses are the top recipients of the H-1B visas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Banks turned to foreign workers before the current economic crisis, said Diane Casey-Landry, chief operating officer for the American Bankers Association. The group said a year ago that demand exceeded the pool of qualified workers in areas like sales, lending and bank administration. Now with massive layoffs, the situation is different, Casey-Landry said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re using taxpayer dollars and there&rsquo;s an expectation that there are benefits to the U.S.,&#8221; said Ron Hira, a national expert on foreign employment and assistant public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. &#8220;What you&rsquo;re really doing is leaking away those jobs and benefits that should accrue to the taxpayers.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I orginally read this story on another source. I was going to state my views on it, but Mr. Taylor beat me to it and so very concisely in his subheading to the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks lay off Americans, hire foreigners, get bail out money&#8221;</p>
<p>How can it be possible, that some Americans still can&rsquo;t understand how useless, how traitorous and how corrupt our elected officials are in allowing this criminality against the citizenry. The subtitle explains very clearly that CRIMINALITY, is what it is. It is frightening to believe that this nation, has come this far  &mdash;  down.</p>

			<p>What can you say about this? They ran themselves into the ground chasing easy profits, stole our wealth, then bludgeoned/bribed our Congress into bailing them out with our money. Next, they bought each other up and gave themselves bonuses with the stolen money. Now, to top it off, they want to replace the Americans they laid-off with foreigners who will work for less. </p>

			<p>This is just another reason why the greed mongers in charge of the banks should be allowed to fail, and it is just another reason why many of us want to see them collapse, because the enterprises rising up out of the ashes just might revoke those kinds of policies.</p>
<p>The corporate greed merchants and the corrupt leftist politicians have not only sold out this nation, they have sold out the white citizens here as well.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I&rsquo;m all for collapse in order to get the multicults out of our lives.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be true justice to have the unwashed third world masses these people helped to bring into the country rioting at the front of their gated communities, tearing down the barriers in order to get at their assets and food?</p>

			<p>To be fair, if I went to a top notch Indian college I too would want to leave for America as soon as possible. Western countries offer cushy jobs, albeit at a lower wage, to people whose countries are filthy and backwards. There is a high incentive for exceptionally smart people to leave their less gifted peers in South Asia behind(Rushton&rsquo;s argument).</p>
<p>If corporations were really interested in attracting the absolute best they would look for talent in countries that score exceptionally well in international math and science examinations. However the standard of living and career oportunities are already high for Japanese, Korean, or Scandinavian students so their is little incentive to leave.</p>
<p>Its understandable immigration from south America or south Asia is fueled by the desire for a better life but the white middle class has interests of its own to take care of.</p>

I guess we can add these to the growing list of &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;. Then again maybe when the white collar workers start losing their jobs to foreigners like blue collar workers have been doing for years there will finally be an outcry to stop the madness and a call to get the immigration system under control.</p>

			<p>2009 will be a watershed year.</p>
<p>If our government still feels even vaguely concerned about the welfare of the American people during this unprecedented financial crisis, it will declare a moratorium on guest-worker visas and make a sincere effort to secure the border and deport illegal aliens.</p>
<p>But if our government has finally grown so powerful, so entrenched, and so controlled by international interests that it no longer feels it necessary to even PRETEND to care, then we&rsquo;ll see more guest workers and amnesty for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>At least we won&rsquo;t have to argue with our family &amp; friends any more.  Even the dimmest will finally be able to understand what is happening.</p>

			<p>I really would like to know what&rsquo;s behind all this. This is not isolated. Why are so many &#8220;American&#8221; companies rejecting Americans for jobs but running overseas and bringing in non-Americans?</p>

<p>Other industries, even now, keep sending jobs to India and China, even as they lay off Americans by the thousands.</p>

			<p>Call this what it is&hellip; ANOTHER MORAL OUTRAGE! We taxpayers are required to bail out corporations (banks) who are actively screwing Americans by outsourcing as much work as possible! Sorry, banks trying to &#8220;save&#8221; on labor costs, in this case, is NOT, EMPHATICALLY NOT, a legitimate excuse, given we taxpayers are required to support these corporate entities.</p>
<p>Read my many posts about the harm of those twin crimes   &mdash;   illegal immigration and outsourcing of jobs (to out-of-the-country locales, OR to H1b visa holders).</p>

			<p>I stopped using my Citibank credit card because of this.  We also dropped Qwest as our telephone service provider because of this.  When a company does not hire Americans, we do not use their services.</p>

			<p>After Bank of America acquired LaSalle Bank in Chicago, they also got the building at 540 W. Madison. On the 22nd floor is a bulletin board with leftover notes posted. One of the notes is for Inforsys, Inc. advising the LaSalle Bank workers that HR was putting in for eight &#8220;Technical Analysts&#8221; Hindu-1Bs in the $66-87K salary range that dates back January 2008.</p>
<p>Now, this is a bank building within walking distance of DePaul &amp; Roosevelt Universities downtown. Within a few miles are the Illinois Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Circle and Loyola University. Yet the Bank DELIBERATELY chose NOT TO HIRE any number of US graduates in CS, Math, Physics, Chemistry or EEs that they could have gotten through a simple advertisement directed at American citizens.</p>
<p>And to further add insult to injury, BoA is moving 22 MILLION keystrokes that are currently being done to India; I overheard young Black girls who are really afraid for their jobs at BoA. Yet, all that B. Hussein Obama can do is scream about the bonuses that some Wall Street dudes got when he could actually be doing something by telling Bank of America that giving them money so they can EXPORT American jobs is TREASONOUS.</p>
<p>Is BHO even an American with America&rsquo;s interest at heart?</p>
<p>You decide.</p>
