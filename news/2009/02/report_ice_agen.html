<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090219/Ice.Raids/">Report: ICE Agents Pressured to Meet Arrest Quotas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 24 Hispanics at a convenience store in Baltimore two years ago after their supervisor told them to &#8220;bring more bodies&#8221; because they were behind their annual quota of 1,000 arrests per team, according to an ICE report released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The immigration rights group CASA de Maryland, which has accused ICE of racial profiling in the 2007 raid, released the agency&rsquo;s internal investigation report and said it shows that the agents acted improperly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CASA officials have charged that ICE agents ignored blacks and whites at the 7-Eleven store as they rounded up all of the Hispanics, even crossing the street to detain Hispanics waiting at a bus stop.</p>
<p>Soon after the raid, Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) asked for an investigation into whether the ICE officers racially profiled the people they arrested. ICE&rsquo;s internal probe found the allegations to be unsubstantiated, Fobbs said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have confidence that the new Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will fairly address this and other immigration issues,&#8221; Mikulski said in an e-mailed statement in response to Wednesday&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>Of the 24 men arrested in the raid, one proved that he was in the country legally, 19 were deported or voluntarily returned to their native countries and four remain in immigration proceedings, said Justin Cox, an attorney with CASA representing some of the men.</p>
<p>The ICE agents involved in the raid are part of the agency&rsquo;s fugitive operations program, which tracks down violent criminals living in the country illegally. Agency records from the program show that beginning in 2004, the teams were assigned to arrest at least 125 fugitive immigrants. In 2006, each team&rsquo;s quota was increased to 1,000 fugitive arrests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The debate over the raid centers on whether the agents had probably cause to detain the men or whether agents targeted them simply because they were Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that this validates all the concerns that the immigrant rights community has been expressing for the past couple of years,&#8221; Cox said.<br>

			<p>This is really a story in The Onion, right?</p>
<p>Baltimore?  Hello?  You&rsquo;re only rarely going to run into a black or white person who is in country illegally.</p>
<p>Of these men that were &#8220;deported,&#8221; that means that they were ordered to return to their country of origin.  That doesn&rsquo;t actually mean they were physically deported, as another story here in AR today demonstrates.</p>
<p>That would be like saying that someone on the lam from a prison term is incarcerated.</p>

			<p>It was the bank-robber Willie Sutton, who when asked why he robbed banks replied, &#8220;Because that&rsquo;s where the money is.&#8221;  Hispanics comprise about 85% of illegals.  Hence, the best way to catch illegals is to look among Hispanics.</p>

			<p>The idiocy of bans on racial profiling is that everybody pretends to believe something they all know is false.  We all know that young black men are more crime prone than just about any other group.  We also know that the great majority of illegal immigrants are Hispanic.  </p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple test: talk to a person. If they speak no English at all, or have an accent, then there&rsquo;s a high likelihood they&rsquo;re illegal. If they&rsquo;re Hispanic or, to some lesser degree, Asian, then there&rsquo;s a strong likelihood they&rsquo;re illegal. It&rsquo;s just math, damnit.</p>
<p>Simple fact is that &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; is just another way to say &#8220;using your brain.&#8221; You can&rsquo;t ban that.</p>

			<p>One of the benefits of race is that it&rsquo;s an easy way to identify somebody as being one of your own or a foreigner - one of your own usually being more trustworthy and carrying more of your own genes.  One of the flaws of &#8220;diversity&#8221; is that there is now no way to identify locals vs. invaders at a glance.  Instead you must depend on government papers.  As long as we have borders and immigration law, there is no way to honor them in the presence of &#8220;diversity&#8221; without imposing draconian measures upon the population as a whole.  This means each and every one of us will be expected to show &#8220;our papers&#8221; on demand.</p>

			<p>When most people think of illegal immigrants, the first group that comes to mind is Latinos.  However, there are a lot of people coming in from other parts of the world too such as Africa (especially from East African countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, Egypt, etc.) and Asia (particularly China, India and the Philippines).<br><br>  <br>
In some areas of the country (Washington DC, New York, Atlanta, etc.) up to 1/4 to 1/3 of the black population are African-born immigrants.  <i>(Source: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/anqgb6)" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/anqgb6)</a></i></p>

			<p>The absurd &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; charge is a sign of times. So many morons were hired by various governemtnal entities over past few decades that it must surprise no one how idiotic the current policies are.</p>
<p>The majority of Mexicans in the U.S. are illegal aliens and the majority of illegal aliens in the U.S. are Mexicans. This gives the law enforcement personnel the probable cause to inquire the Mexicans for their immigration status. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only logical to suspect every Mexican of violating the law of the land, and expect that the majority of those lawfully arrested will be Mexicans. Any other outcome would strongly suggest that there is something fundamentally wrong with the enforcement.<br>

<p>Evidently &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; is pretty effective, the results speak for themselves.</p>

			<p>Lots of the non-Hispanic illegals are relatively hard to pick out; they&rsquo;re often students who have spent enough time in the US to have polished the rough edges off their accents, and who simply overstayed their visas.  If ICE is looking to boost their numbers, then going after Hispanics is the most logical approach.</p>

			<p>Regardless of whether or not it was racial profiling, it worked! So one out of twenty-five are inconvenienced, big deal! Most methods of catching crooks aren&rsquo;t this effective and result in far more arrests without conviction.</p>

			<p>About 1 in 4 Hispanics is in the US illegally; about 1 in 10 Asians are here illegally. For whites and blacks the ratios are far, far lower. It makes sense to target the groups with the highest likelihood of illegality. You cannot oulaw the use of statistics in law enforcement. To do so would render the nation ungovernable - but then we almost are, anyway.</p>
