<p>Most whites know modern Africa, if they know it all, either through television nature programs, or through luxury vacations at exclusive game lodges. The tourists play at going on safari and dining on marinated gazelle, washed down with a South African Cabernet. It&rsquo;s all very comfortable, and the sunsets are beautiful, but it is hardly the real Africa. For a brutally honest depiction of the 95 percent that is dangerous and dirty and decrepit  &mdash;  though often still beautiful  &mdash;  we turn to <cite>Dark Star Safari,</cite> a chronicle of a journey through the heart of a continent of failure.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Paul Theroux, who is known for his brilliant travel writings, traveled overland from Cairo to Cape Town. For months, he rode on buses that reeked of body odor, rumbled across axle-breaking roads in the back of a truck through bandit-filled deserts, slept on filthy mattresses in insect-infested hotel rooms, warded off packs of beggars and thieves, turned down prostitutes and meals of rancid goat meat, sweated under a scorching and merciless sun, and met hard-working Africans who had long-since despaired of their continent and whose only hope was to emigrate.</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux had worked as a Peace Corps teacher in Malawi from 1963-64, and as an instructor at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, from 1965-68. These were the years immediately after independence, when hopes were high, and the colonial patterns of life had not yet succumbed to African leadership. He knew that &#8220;all news out of Africa is bad,&#8221; but this only made him want to see for himself. Moreover, he wanted again to taste and feel Africa. This is what he found:</p>
<p>&#8220;Africa is materially more decrepit than it was when I first knew it  &mdash;  hungrier, poorer, less educated, more pessimistic, more corrupt, and you can&rsquo;t tell the politicians from the witch doctors. Africans, less esteemed than ever, seemed to me the most lied to people on earth  &mdash;  manipulated by their governments, burned by foreign experts, befooled by charities, and cheated at every turn. To be an African leader was to be a thief, but evangelists stole people&rsquo;s innocence, and self-serving aid agencies gave them false hope, which seemed worse. In reply, Africans dragged their feet or tried to emigrate, they begged, they pleaded, and they demanded money and gifts with a rude, weird sense of entitlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux does not expect things to improve. Often the only things that seemed to work were left over from European colonists. The ferry he took across Lake Victoria was built by the British in 1962; its original engines, boilers, and generators were still running.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Theroux, the worst part of Africa is the cities. &#8220;Whenever I arrived in an African city, I wanted to leave.&#8221; &#8220;Urban life is nasty all over the world, but it is nastiest in Africa.&#8221; &#8220;None of the African cities I had so far seen, from Cairo southward, seemed fit for human habitation.&#8221; &#8220;African cities became more awful  &mdash;  more desperate and dangerous as they grew larger.&#8221; &#8220;Even at their best, African cities seemed to me miserable improvised anthills, attracting the poor and the desperate from the bush and turning them into thieves and devisers of cruel scams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Egypt, every wall attracts dumpers, litterers, shitters and pissers, dogs and cats, and the noisiest children.&#8221; &#8220;The heat in Khartoum, with its sky specks of rotating hawks, left me gasping.&#8221; Khartoum was so dangerous that the American counsel general did not even live there, but flew in from Cairo during the week. Addis Ababa was &#8220;dirty and falling apart, stinking horribly of unwashed people and sick animals, every wall reeking with urine, every alley blocked with garbage,&#8221; the streets &#8220;full of loud music, car horns, diesel fumes, and pestering urchins.&#8221; Hyenas stalked the streets of Harar, Ethiopia, at night, and people howled at foreigners. Djibouti&rsquo;s &#8220;oppressive heat was not relieved by the scorching breezes off the Gulf of Aden, nor was there any terrain except the landfill look of reclaimed swamp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nairobi was huge and dangerous and ugly.&#8221; There was a palpable sense of &#8220;desperation&#8221; which was &#8220;not the dark side, or a patch of urban blight, but the mood of the place itself.&#8221; He did not go out at night, for even &#8220;the wariest people were robbed.&#8221; Three FBI agents investigating the 1998 embassy bombing were robbed of their wallets and pistols and then mocked and jeered by a large crowd. Even the wild birds stole from people. Kampala was an improvement by comparison but decrepit and in decline. While there, he visited Makerere University, where he had taught, and found it a ruin  &mdash;  the buildings falling apart, the trees cut down, the library an empty shell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mozambique,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;was not a country in decline  &mdash;  this part of it, anyway, could not fall any further.&#8221; Of its capital city, &#8220;It was hard to imagine how much worse a place had to be for a broken-down city like Maputo to seem like an improvement.&#8221; Even once prosperous and orderly Johannesburg was crime-ridden and increasingly ringed with teeming and angry slums. &#8220;That&rsquo;s what happened in Africa: things fell apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux tells story after story that demonstrate the hopeless passivity of so many Africans. In the &#8220;sun-baked emptiness&#8221; of the Wagago Plains in Tanzania, he spotted a single mango tree &#8220;of modest size but leafy with dense boughs. There was a circle of shade beneath it. Within that shade were thirty people, pressed against one another to keep in the shade, watched by a miserable goat tethered in the sunshine.&#8221; He wondered why &#8220;no one in this hot, exposed place had thought to plant more mango trees for the shade they offered. It was simple enough to plant a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux rode with a cattle truck on the desert road linking Ethiopia and Kenya. He described the road as &#8220;spectacularly bad,&#8221; full of &#8220;wheel-swallowing potholes,&#8221; deep ruts, and enormous razor-sharp boulders. One of the tires ripped open. &#8220;That was to be expected here  &mdash;  by me, anyway,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;Apparently not by Mustafa and the others, for they had no spare. They shook out junk from a burlap sack &hellip; and began amateurishly to whack the wheel, as though they had never been in this fix before.&#8221; Mr. Theroux sums up the situation: &#8220;This is not good  &mdash;  a breakdown in the desert where no one cares whether I live or die. I am stranded among the most incompetent and unresourceful mechanics I have ever seen.&#8221; Luckily, another cattle truck rumbled by and Mr. Theroux was able to catch a ride.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe, he visited a farm run by a charming hard-working white family $22 million in debt and assailed by squatters. He spoke to one of the latter, who was from neighboring Zambia. He was furious because the government had not helped him. He needed seed, fertilizer, and a tractor. He now expected the owner of the farm to give him supplies and plow his fields. &#8220;Having invaded the land and staked his claim and put up four big huts, he now wanted free seed, free fertilizer, and the fields plowed at his bidding, his victim working the tractor. It was like a thief who, having stolen a coat, insisted that his victim have the coat dry-cleaned and tailored to fit.&#8221; When Mr. Theroux asked him what he would do if people came and squatted on <em>his</em> land, he exploded in rage. He would drive them off.</p>
<p>While in Malawi, Mr. Theroux visited his old school, hoping it had been modernized and improved. &#8220;The school was almost unrecognizable,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;What had been a group of school buildings in a large grove of trees was a compound of battered buildings in a muddy open field. The trees had been cut down and the grass was chest high. At first glance the place was so poorly maintained as to seem abandoned: broken windows, doors ajar, mildewed walls, gashes in the roofs, and only a few people standing around, empty-handed, doing nothing but gaping at me.&#8221; It seemed as if the failure of post-colonial Africa was all here, as if deliberately staged.</p>
<p>Also in Malawi, he visited the old Zomba Gymkhana Club, which had once been the social center for resident Europeans, mainly British. In the early &rsquo;60s, Mr. Theroux had heard members complain that if Africans were let in, they would ruin the club: They would get drunk, tear up the billiard table, women would nurse babies in the game room. At the time, Mr. Theroux considered such thoughts &#8220;rude and racist,&#8221; yet seeing the club today he realized they were &#8220;fairly prescient, for the rowdy teenagers at the billiard table were stabbing their cues at the torn felt, the bar was full of drunks, and a woman was breast feeding her baby under the dart board.&#8221; Many writers would have left out this story, as it vindicates &#8220;racist&#8221; predictions, but Mr. Theroux is too truthful and thorough a writer for that.</p>
<p>He asked a Malawian official to explain why the government had chased the Indian shopkeepers out of the country in the 1970s. The official explained that the Africans deserved a chance to run the shops, so they took them over; but soon the stores all failed. Twenty-seven years later, the town still had no shops. When Mr. Theroux pointed out that expropriation had backfired, another African interrupted and began mocking the way the Indians did business: &#8220;They sit there, you see, and they have these little pieces of paper, and have these columns of numbers. And one Indian is running the calculator, and another is counting the sacks of flour and the tins of condensed milk. One two three. One two three.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux explains: &#8220;What this educated African with his plummy voice intended as mockery  &mdash;  the apparent absurdity of all this counting  &mdash;  was the description of people doing a simple inventory of goods in a shop.&#8221; When he pointed this out, the African replied that his people had neither the aptitude nor the desire to run businesses. &#8220;What do we care about shops and counting? We have a much freer existence. We have no interest in this  &mdash;  shops are not our strong point.&#8221; Mr. Theroux, growing exasperated, asked why then had they taken over the shops. The answer was that the Africans might find a use for them some day (most were still empty, but a few had become beer bars). Mr. Theroux&rsquo;s conclusion: &#8220;I had never heard such bullshit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux does not say this, but the real answer to his question was envy. The Africans could not stand to see successful small businesses run by foreigners, so they kicked them out and took them over. Envy of non-Africans continues to motivate Africa. The land seizures in Zimbabwe, the murders of white farmers in South Africa, and the urban crime wave in Johannesburg and Cape Town, are obvious examples (see next article for a complementary view of African thinking).</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux fits most Westerners in Africa into one of three categories. First, there are the tourists, usually on safari. Mr. Theroux dismisses them as &#8220;fantasists.&#8221; Then there are the &#8220;agents of virtue&#8221;  &mdash;  the international aid workers, whom Mr. Theroux describes as haughty, aloof, ineffective jerks who rarely stay in Africa long enough to realize the extent of their failure; and the altruists, missionaries and others, who are there to save Africa and Africans.</p>
<p>He met a young, attractive Finnish woman working on an AIDS project in Zambia. She had been in Africa only a short time, but was already disillusioned. &#8220;It is horrible. There is no sex education. No one will talk about sex, but everyone does it. No one will talk about AIDS, and everyone is infected. We were sent an anti-AIDS film and we showed it. But people in the village said it was shameful  &mdash;  too indecent  &mdash;  and so it was withdrawn.&#8221; Mr. Theroux asked if she had talked to them. She had. The result? &#8220;They wanted to have sex with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Mozambique, he met a naive female missionary who was running a shelter designed to get prostitutes and boys off the streets. One night she was robbed by a group of boys. She recognized them as boys she had bathed, fed, and clothed; what&rsquo;s worse, they recognized her. Mr. Theroux recalled that Christian missionaries had been at work here since 1508: &#8220;Five centuries of this!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux was victim of only one crime in Africa, and it came at the very end. Before taking a four-day side trip to the coast, he left his valuables (watch, wallet, cash, air tickets, African artifacts) for safekeeping in a Johannesburg hotel strong room. He returned to find everything stolen. &#8220;That&rsquo;s very Janiceburg, very Jozi,&#8221; one resident later told him.</p>
<p>Mr. Theroux does not absolve Africans of responsibility for their own plight, but the only Africans he singles out for blame are the corrupt and thieving leaders. His book makes it clear that sloth, lack of planning, and envy are to blame for much of Africa&rsquo;s plight, but he never says this directly nor does he consider the possibility Africans may be of lower intelligence than whites.</p>
<p>What is to be done with the place? Mr. Theroux condemns Western governments, international organizations, and private aid agencies for making the continent&rsquo;s problems worse. He believes the only solution is to pull out the whole apparatus of Western relief and development, and let <em>Africans</em> define their problems, work out solutions, and live according to their habits and customs. He does not doubt that by Western standards the continent will remain undeveloped and primitive, will perhaps become much more so, but it may be able to sustain itself and create a life that is livable for Africans. He seems to think that if left alone, Africans will drift slowly back to their ancestral villages and turn once again to labor-intensive agriculture. Africa would not revert entirely back to a pre-contact state, but it might go halfway.</p>
<p>This may be an overly romantic view. The slaughter in Rwanda/Burundi, the double amputees in Sierra Leone, the witch-burnings and black magic common throughout black Africa, and the cannibalism that has come to light in the Congo are chilling examples of what Africans can do when left to themselves. Perhaps a return to old-fashioned European colonialism is the best solution. Short of that, a policy of leaving Africa alone, with all its potential perils, may be the best realistic choice we have.

								<h2><a href="/ar/2003/12/index.html#article2 ">Africa and the Cult of Development</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>American Renaissance, December 2003</i></font>
						</p>
						<p> <i>The following is adapted from the Sept -Oct. 1993 review of a book about Africa by Gedahlia Braun called </i>Racism, Guilt and Self-Deceit<i> (<b>to order, send e-mail to gene@global.co.za</b>). It throws light on what the Malawians may have been thinking when they expelled the Indian shopkeepers and took over their stores. It may also explain why blacks in Zimbabwe who know nothing about running a modern farm seize white farms and expect wealth to follow.</i></p>
<p>How the vast majority of Africans think must be understood in light of how poorly they grasp how the world works. Dr. Braun reminds us that belief in magic is deeply rooted among Africans. He reports that when a European magician came to Ibadan, Nigeria, and &#8220;sawed a woman in half,&#8221; the audience assumed he had actually cut her in two. After all, if African witch doctors can fly through the air and turn people into alligators, the least a white man can do is cut people in two and put them back together.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun reports that many Africans see Western technology and high standards of living as a kind of magic. Many think a college diploma is not an indication of a certain level of knowledge but a talisman that can magically make a big house and a Mercedes appear. Even the blacks who run African schools have superstitious beliefs in the <em>forms</em> of education; if white schools have a study period at 2:00 p.m., black schools must have one at the same time even if it is inconvenient. Many blacks think whites get their money simply by walking around in a suit with a briefcase and going into banks, where they get as much as they want. Whites have selfishly denied the benefits of this magic to Africans.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun quotes extensively from a brilliant article that likens the African attitude towards economic development to the cargo cults of the Pacific islanders. Some of these islands had been ignored by the modern world until the Second World War, during which the Allies used them as staging areas. To the wonderment of the natives, giant metal birds flew down from the sky, in response to various ceremonies such as the building of long flat clearings in the jungle. Out of the bellies of the giant metal birds came marvelous things like flash lights and round metal boxes filled with food.</p>
<p>When the war was over and the Allies left, the islanders decided to take over the rituals themselves. They built their own flat clearings in the jungle, and set upon them giant birds made of boxes and coconut trees so as to coax their great metal cousins down from the sky. They pretended to be soldiers, marching in formation around the flat clearings and waving strips of cloth stuck on sticks. Somehow the magic did not work; the giant metal birds never came back.</p>
<p>Just as the cargo cultists believed that by manipulating some of the <em>forms</em> of 20th century commerce they could reap 20th century rewards, Africans believe that a paved highway here and a parking lot there will bring the magical cargo of development.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun quotes further:</p>
<p>&#8220;When the first spurt of national infrastructure building failed to produce the desired cargo of development, additional rituals were invented. A ritual of North-South dialogue was started to persuade the guardian spirits of development to bring aid, to transfer technology, and to grant better terms of trade. When this ritual also failed, Third-World spokesmen resorted to blaming the West for holding up Third-World Development.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Africans continue to believe that development is a form of magic they will never achieve it.</p>

			<p>This was one of the very first articles I read from AR, and it&rsquo;s a bewildering piece. One can only imagine what Africa will be like now that Euro-American investment into the continent seems likely to decline. South Africa looks troubled with the boorish Zuma about to come to power, although Zimbabwe will hopefully be at least less brutal now that Tsvangarai is part of a power sharing deal.</p>
<p>I agree with Theroux&rsquo;s conclusion that a complete withdrawal of finance, infrastructure and diaspora populations from Africa would be the best course of action. Without Western finance to back themselves up, the continent&rsquo;s thuggish leaders will be less able to exert power over their people, and Western nations will benefit hugely from the lack of an African diaspora in their midst.</p>

Another refreshingly honest book on Africa I would recommend is:</p>
<p><b>Out of America: A Black Man Confronts Africa</b> by Keith Richburg</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as brutal but it confirms similar observations from the perspective of a black American who also can&rsquo;t grasp what he&rsquo;s seeing all around him.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ask.com/bar?q=out+of+america+a+black+man+confronts+Africa&amp;page=1&amp;qsrc=0&amp;zoom=&amp;ab=2&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capmag.com%2Farticle.asp%3FID%3D799" rel="nofollow">https://www.ask.com/bar?q=out+of+america+a+black+man+confronts+Africa&page;=1&qsrc;=0&zoom;=&ab;=2&u;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capmag.com%2Farticle.asp%3FID%3D799</a><br>

&#8220;He asked a Malawian official to explain why the government had chased the Indian shopkeepers out of the country in the 1970s. The official explained that the Africans deserved a chance to run the shops, so they took them over; but soon the stores all failed. Twenty-seven years later, the town still had no shops.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I knew an Indian fellow in Canada whose family had been in the shopkeeping class in Tanzania during the same period. I don&rsquo;t recall whether his famiy had been driven out of Africa like in Malawi (and Uganda and any number of other sub-Saharan hot-spots) or had left voluntarily   &mdash;   but in light of his bitterness toward Africans it was likely the former. Because the things this Indian-Canadian had to say about &#8220;the blacks&#8221; in Tanzania were just about the most vicious and &#8220;racist&#8221;   &mdash;   though I&rsquo;m certain entirely TRUE   &mdash;   criticisms I have EVER heard from a person of one race about people of another race. </p>
<p>So hostile, in fact, that they&rsquo;d never get past the moderators here at AmRen! </p>
<p>I often think of this otherwise pleasant and mild-mannered Hindu when I hear white liberals blast their fellow whites as &#8220;the most racist people on earth&#8221; or other such self-hating nonsense. Needless to say, those white liberals almost NEVER have as much direct experience with blacks as this Indian had. Unlike pampered and deluded white liberals of the West, this Indian actually knew what he was talking about! </p>
<p>Excellent article BTW, thanks for reprinting! </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like phrases like this one.  It&rsquo;s the sort of thing an equalitarian would say.  How has Africa failed, unless one defines success as being white?  Africa, Africans, African-Americans, are not &#8220;failures&#8221; and have not &#8220;failed&#8221;, except to be Europe, Europeans, and European-Americans, respectively.</p>

			<p>If I didn&rsquo;t know better I would think he were describing LA, Detroit, Tijuana or Juarez.</p>
<p>America is degenerating rapidly now and could well reach such levels in twenty five years if separation doesn&rsquo;t come about.  If it does, the non-white areas will be like that.</p>
<p>Where Africans go so go failure.  It&rsquo;s been that way for 5000 years.  Why would anyone expect anything different?</p>

			<p>Africa has made much progress economically and socially but its not good enough. They have to up their game on their own. As someone who has been there and worked with the people I can safely say with out prejuidice that Africans do cling to magic, drink alot, have no clue about how the world functions, are very over sexed, sing and dance to much, poorly educated (do to poor parenting, laziness, or poor government), and most dont understand right from wrong or punctuality.</p>
<p>I think we should cut our funding (our losses that we need) to that content and just send different advisors to Africa to help them out some.</p>

<p>I agree.  It&rsquo;s the same sort of mindset that assumes education is a magic cure-all, and a person with an IQ of 90 can succeed at electrical engineering if he could only start preschool early enough.  Africa is what it is.</p>

			<p>Why should we assume that we need to help any african nation, why is it our responsibility? they live on the richest continent on earth, with plenty of people and energy, and yet the whole world has to care for them.  Nothing will change that, just read Dr Albert Schweitzers writings, he will attest to it, and who knows better.  Blacks will only improve when there are harsher standards put on them, and enforced.</p>

<p>I have felt this for a long time but I could not have said it better. Most of the blacks in this country have the same sort of thinking. They think that if only they went to the &#8216;white&rsquo; school success would follow. They don&rsquo;t seem to understand that they would actually have to learn something and then go out into the world and apply that knowledge. Success would just follow attendance at the &#8216;white&rsquo; school as if by magic.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Africa has made much progress economically and socially but its not good enough.&#8221; Posted by rational thinker at 8:39 PM on February 13 </p>
<p>r:  Where do you get your information?  Africa is reverting back to villages and tribes, as the infrastructure the white man built crumbles to ruin, because of a black inability to maintain and build.  Blacks will forever be the world&rsquo;s failures.  Having an anomaly occassionally where one might have a little intelligence is overshadowed by the fact he is one out of thousands, but worse yet, he is rendered useless because of his other inabilities, like organization, thrift, looking ahead, etc., all traits that are absent from blacks.</p>
<p>RT:  &#8220;They have to up their game on their own.&#8221; </p>
<p>RT:  &#8220;As someone who has been there and worked with the people I can safely say with out prejuidice that Africans do cling to magic, drink alot, have no clue about how the world functions, are very over sexed, sing and dance to much, poorly educated (do to poor parenting, laziness, or poor government), and most dont understand right from wrong or punctuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>r:  With such handicaps, how can they &#8220;up&#8221; their game on their own?</p>
<p>RT:  &#8220;I think we should cut our funding (our losses that we need) to that content and just send different advisors to Africa to help them out some.&#8221;</p>
<p>r:  You just wrote above that they have to, &#8220;Up their game on their own.&#8221;  Isn&rsquo;t it contradictory to say we should offer help?</p>

<i>&#8220;Many blacks think whites get their money simply by walking around in a suit with a briefcase and going into banks, where they get as much as they want. Whites have selfishly denied the benefits of this magic to Africans.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This article is filled with simple observations about blacks that are witnessed in any society.</p>
<p>Yes, blacks believe there is this pool of money that exists that only whites have access to. That&rsquo;s one reason they want to get into a wide variety of positions of power and influence so they can redistribute this wealth. What they fail to understand is that wealth just doesn&rsquo;t exist. It has to be generated. And if you fail to generate wealth, the cash stops flowing.</p>
<p>So when they get control of a group, business, or government, the results are always the same. They take from the source without any regards to where the money came from and how to keep the source of the money flowing. In short order, the system collapses.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t see themselves as the cause. They simply believe the pool of money is still really locked in the hands of racist whites. More demands for more power and more money.</p>
<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s a metiphorical &#8216;black hole&rsquo;. The black way of doing things is only to take, not give or create.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point. Whites keep propping up a culture that is incapable of sustaining itself. Let Africans find their own equilibrium. There are far too many Africans alive for the infrastructure they have built. White people need to get out of the black people&rsquo;s realm once and for all and visa versa. Diversity doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

			<p>Well, I have some mixed feelings regarding this review, as well as the subject matter.</p>
<p>I fail to see anything wrong with blacks trying to drive whites out of Africa. I also don&rsquo;t share the reviewer&rsquo;s and the author&rsquo;s summary disapproval of the current (miserable) state of affairs there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blacks&rsquo; natural right to try to build their primitive societies the way they see it fit. Why anyone at his right mind would expect them to welcome white civilization in which they could not compete with smarter businesmen, merchants, and professionals? Questioning validity of blacks&rsquo; natural resistance against alien culture equals to denying them their basic right to a nation state.</p>
<p>Here is a more rational perspective on these issues.</p>
<p>Let blacks build whatever societies they want and - except for bona fide trading - let&rsquo;s not interfere with their &#8220;internal&#8221; matters. If they want to behave naturally, let them do that. With one proviso: hands off. If they fail they fail, and that&rsquo;s their right. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compete with their nation-states economically, for the land they have and for the natural resources of that land. And let them compete for ours. That is their right as well as our right, and it&rsquo;s only fair thing to do. The countries and societies that are more successful (fit, as you will), be it ours or theirs, will replace, eventually, the ones that are not. The most successful peoples will populate the lands of the less successful ones, and utilize these lands to their fullest extent. Any interference with that process amounts to reckless (and stupid) manipulation of healthy evolution.</p>
<p>We need to re-learn one thing from blacks in Africa. Like them, we should reject alien cultures that are being imposed on us and demand our basic right to a nation-state. If we are wrong we will fail and other peoples will replace us. If we are right we will prevail. And let&rsquo;s kick all those who try to deny us this basic right kick out from our country right away.</p>

<p>An Amren Reader wrote</p>
<p>But the reality - facts on the ground in 2008 are that many/most Black Americans with college diplomas are leveraging this piece of paper into successful programs to get - those expensive things listed above.</p>
<p>Look at Michelle and Barack Obama - Michelle leveraged her college education of racial resentment studying to land a $350,000 a year job as get this:</p>
<p>Director of Diversity with the University of Chicago paying her for this.</p>
<p>She reportedly did not have to work any more than 15 hours a week. And the U of C would save more money if she worked less than 5 hours a week as her work is just pressuring to create more Diversity jobs for her people.</p>
<p>Amren readers too often make the mistake of thinking that Blacks are &#8220;stupid&#8221; have lower IQs than White Western peoples. Though Blacks have on average lower IQs, it is our White people who are being stupid for ignoring, or denying the successful racial warfare tactics Blacks throughout the world use against us - and they are effective.</p>
<p>As opposed to our White side that makes the mistake over and over again of trying to be &#8220;nice&#8221;, &#8220;fair&#8221;, not racist and work for a just, merit society where individuals are just as individuals, not part of a group.</p>
<p>Ignoring racial realities is like ignoring Winter in Chicago - global warming will not save you from freezing to death if you ignore the brutal realities of Winter in Chicago or racial/crime realities. </p>

			<p>I agree that the term &#8220;continent of failure&#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t be applied, because it is judged by a Western standard.  However, it is fair to state Africa is a continent of misery, death, and despair, with no apparent solid hopes for the future.  That&rsquo;s true and that&rsquo;s a fair assessment.</p>
<p>We should also realize importing that misery serves negative purpose only in our futures.</p>

<p>I think you are missing the original poster&rsquo;s point.  Africa is what it is.  Saying Africa &#8220;failed&#8221; implies  that their was some strategy available to them through which they could have attained comparable levels of prosperity as European and Asian countries; and that is unlikely to be true.</p>
<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s American and European expectations for Africa&rsquo;s development that have failed.  Africans, understandably, want to emigrate to white countries to share in the prosperity that whites have created.  Those aspirations should never have been encouraged by the leadership of American and European countries to begin with.      </p>

<p>Your country has raked up a debt of over 60 trillion dollars. Now if all the other countries were to collect their debt and we had nothing to show for it are dollar would drop below what the GERMANS had after WWI.</p>
<p>Get a grip, I love how point the finger at people that are by your standards inferior, yet your country is going down the drain due to debt. It would be a lie to blame it on welfare because thats only one percent of our overall budget.</p>

<p>Africa is GREAT at being Africa.  It&rsquo;s horrible at being Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be a relativist here.  I&rsquo;m just trying to point out that the only thing Africa has failed at is living up to white standards.  Who in his right mind thinks white standards are applicable to blacks?  This question goes double for race realists; we of all people should know that &#8220;black failure&#8221; only exists insofar as liberal nutcases <b>assume</b> blacks can and should be judged by white standards, and that there&rsquo;s a problem when they do not.</p>

			<p>Basically this is an issue of survival of the fittest.  If we couldn&rsquo;t travel to Africa and they were isolated, then their failure would be their own.  </p>
<p>However, seeing the Western society made them realize there was a greater civilization, but they don&rsquo;t know how to obtain on their own&hellip;  Many of the advances in Europe were from the East, they brought back with them&hellip; Societies learn from others, but you have to have the ability to learn in a social environment.   </p>
<p>If their lack of advancement is from the governments, then they need to deal with it, more aid won&rsquo;t help.  There is allot of genocide in Africa, they kill their own.. And some just over &#8220;skin color&#8221; as there are light and dark Africans.  I know that isn&rsquo;t being nice, but they need a change of philosophy before they go into the 21st century. </p>
<p>I had two teachers in community college, both were from Kenya, and they were definately intelligent, warm, wonderful gentlemen. They taught Anthropology and Sociology and I enjoyed their classes immensely.   They had to work hard to become Professors at a PhD level.. It isn&rsquo;t handed to you.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know who designed the animation or who is going to actually build those buildings and create the landscape, but as you said, it&rsquo;ll probably involve European and Japanese companies, much like the building boom in Abu Dhabi did.<br>

			<p>aid to countries like africa is like throwing it into a hole. i commend countries like australia, who are actually cutting off the native aborigines fro mall government aid, since it is leading to their speedy demise. now, without the aid, they are getting jobs, going back to some of their old cultural habits for survival, etc. the west is far too ignorant to learn this lesson.<br>
yes, these countries - including all of the middle east, are not &#8216;developing&rsquo; for the past 1,000 years, they are truly regressing. after all, if africa is so wonderful, why is everyone trying to get out ? - to europe, the usa, anywhere BUT africa.<br>
when i was younger, i thought it would be fun to go to an african safari, but as i&rsquo;ve grown physically and in intelligence, that trip would be worthless and unacceptably dangerous. no thanks.<br>
most of the africans i&rsquo;ve known in the USA have been whoremongers, liars, cheats, theives, secret polygamists, cheaters, many sexual perverts, and few that had any idea how to wear deodorant or even take wash daily.<br>
even in america, we can easily see the perils of giving aid to blacks/ african americans. <br>
it is, in my opinion, very cruel to continue to give any aid to them. today, we even are lowering educational standards to make them feel more intelligent, while intelligent whites are leaving those same schools in droves, home schooling, doing anything to escape the dangers of public schooling. <br>
same issue with &#8216;integrated&rsquo; neighborhoods. </p>

<p>This is literally true. A few years ago I was waiting to be served in a bank in Hammersmith, West London. It was open plan, as is now the fashion, and I was so fascinated by the conversation at a nearby desk that I lingered just to be sure of what I was hearing. An African man had clearly just opened an account at the branch and did not understand why his first attempt to withdraw cash had failed. The extremely patient bank employee was explaining to him that he had to deposit money in the account; it did not come with cash already in it!</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably an affirmative CEO by now.</p>

The African continent is much too valuable a resource to be left in the hands of Africans. It is in the interests of both whites and blacks to develop the continent but we shouldn&rsquo;t kid ourselves that anything will happen without Whites being put in charge. Of course this would require a revolution in the mindset of whites who presently think throwing good money at Africans will solve their problems. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;.it is our White people who are being stupid for ignoring, or denying the successful racial warfare tactics Blacks throughout the world use against us - and they are effective&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, blacks are neither organized nor smart enough to use &#8216;successful racial warfare tactics&rsquo; against Whites.</p>
<p>Blacks are used by Marxist elitists, enemies of Whites, as a battering ram against Whites and Western Civilization. The Marxists founded black organizations, used their vast funds, their glib, skillful lawyers, their self-created PC gestapo to destroy Whites (threatening their jobs, neighborhoods, reputations, and lives if they refuse to accept their second-class citizenship).</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Marcus Garvey stormed out of NAACP headquarters exclaiming it was a White organization.</p>
<p><a href="/ar/1999/03.html#article3" rel="nofollow">/ar/1999/03/#article3</a></p>
<p>These are the tactics that work.  And they didn&rsquo;t come from blacks.  </p>

			<p>But the West is supposed to continue to pour billions of their money, even in a deep recession, into Africa because we must help the poor population survive and increase even at a greater rate &amp; then need much more of our billions. I suspect mostly what billions in aid to Africa will improve is the Swiss bank accounts of Africa&rsquo;s klepto-rulers. </p>

			<p>I firmly believe that sub saharan Africa should have been left in its tribal state (like it is in many parts of Papua New Guinea) and ignored by the rest of the world. That would have been best for the black man and other humans too. The black man would not have to be competing with more capable races in a medieval or technological setting.</p>

			<p>Guys, while were busy arguing about what to do with Africa, China is busy gobbling the continent up.  China was behind the Rowandan genocide (getting the smart Tutsis out of the way, and also as a practice run for destabilizing other nations).  I suspect that Africa will be for China what Chrysler was for Mercedes.  But let the Chinese find that out for themselves.  And let them assume the burden of ministering to the Africans.</p>
<p>In any event, Africa&rsquo;s problem is Africans.  Maybe enough Chinese will impregnate enough native women to raise the collective IQ.  Personally, I think the continent is hopeless.  And it is like a tumor that has spawned other tumors everywhere but Aisia.  Think of Detroit and New Orleans as little Africa tumors.</p>

Ethiopia isn&rsquo;t considered Sub-Sahara Africa.  Sahara refers to the Saharan Desert, and Sub-Sahara Africa is what used to be called &#8220;Black Africa&#8221;.  Ethiopia and Sudan are traditionally considered North African because of their Arab influence and Mediterranian trade connections.  </p>
<p>Ethiopians certainly don&rsquo;t consider themselves Sub-Sahara African!  They&rsquo;re proud of their Middle-Eastern roots and many consider themselves to have Arab or Jewish heritage - they often have prominent thin noses like Arabs.  Ethiopia is much more civilized that Sub-Sahara Africa, although it&rsquo;s still a starving mess&hellip;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Many think a college diploma is not an indication of a certain level of knowledge but a talisman that can magically make a big house and a Mercedes appear. &hellip; Many blacks think whites get their money simply by walking around in a suit with a briefcase and going into banks, where they get as much as they want. Whites have selfishly denied the benefits of this magic to Africans.&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
<i>I have felt this for a long time but could not have said it better. Most of the blacks in this country have the same sort of thinking. They think that if only they went to the &lsquo;white&rsquo; school, success would just follow attendance at the &lsquo;white&rsquo; school as if by magic.  <br>
They don&rsquo;t understand that they would actually have to learn something and then go out into the world and apply that knowledge. </i></p>
<p>- Realist in Atlanta<br>
  &mdash;   -   &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   <br>
So very true!  The same basic kind of thinking is rampant here. It underlies all our educational programs and government attempts at imposed integration. And it costs us billions.<br>
 <br>
Whites are hoarding all the knowledge in the white schools    &mdash;  -  that explains black failure. Whites are hoarding all the nicest homes in white neighborhoods   &mdash;    that&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t want blacks coming in.  </p>
<p>They even belive that whites have the best foods in white supermarkets   &mdash;   even though they are all part of the same chain!   They belive that white workers get the best medical care   &mdash;   even though they&rsquo;re all part of the same medical plan.  That white kids get the best teachers, favored treatment, etc.  You get a promotion or raise at work&hellip;. it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re WHITE, that&rsquo;s why!  It&rsquo;s all unfair.  It&rsquo;s all because of discrimination.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, whites have all the best because they won&rsquo;t let blacks have any. Stingy whites keep it all for themselves.  No wonder blacks have a grudge.   And yes, they all think that whites have a secret money tree hidden somewhere in the back yard.   Why else are you not in credit card debt up to your eyebrows, the way they are?  Why wasn&rsquo;t your car repossessed like theirs was?   It&rsquo;s discrimination!   You must have some special secret that you refuse to share.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Well, an obelisk is not a &#8220;buildihg&#8221;, but anyway &hellip;.  you can thank Saint Frumentius, a Greek,  for that.  (He wasn&rsquo;t a black man.)</p>
<p>- - - - - - - - - - -  <br>
<i>Saint Frumentius was the first Bishop of Axum, and he is credited with bringing Christianity to Aksumite Kingdom.   He was a Syro-Phoenician Greek born in Tyre.<br>
 <br>
As a boy, Frumentious and his brother accompanied their uncle on a voyage. When their ship stopped at one of the harbors of the Red Sea, people of the neighborhood massacred the whole crew, with the exception of the two boys who were taken as slaves to the King of Axum. The boys soon gained the favour of the king, who raised them to positions of trust, and shortly before his death, gave them their liberty. The became tutors to the heir, Ezana.<br>
 <br>
Frumentius  [later became a priest and] returned to Ethiopia, erected his episcopal see at Axum, baptized King Ezana, who had meanwhile succeeded to the throne, built many churches, and spread Christianity throughout Ethiopia. </i></p>
<p>Just look at the picture of Frumentius.  Was he (even remotely) &#8220;black&#8221;?<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Frumentius" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Frumentius</a></p>
<p>The obelisk, found  lying in ruin and in pieces by Italian troops in 1937, was taken to Italy by those wicked, evil fascists and erected in Rome.   It has now (just last year) been returned, after being repaired and reinforced, and is being erected by an Italian crew of engineers headed by engineer Giorgio Croci  (hint: not an Ethiopian).</p>
<p>The operation is costing Italy an estimated 6m euros ($7.7m).  According to the BBC, it is the largest, heaviest object ever transported by air.  Just have a good look at <i><b> who  </b></i>is doing this work (hint: not a black man).<br>

			<p>One one hand, every nation or country on earth has the right to be left alone. Just take your hands off Africa. Stop aiding food, health care, etc..</p>
<p>One the other hand, every nation or country on earth has the right to determine who are eligible to come to work or live. </p>
<p>Developed nations such as Western Europe need to implement strictest immigration rules and deport non-assimilable &amp; social parasites.</p>
<p>If the Europeans left Africa, Africans could leave Europe -at least could stop coming to Europe-.</p>
