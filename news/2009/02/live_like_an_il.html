<h1><a href="https://www.abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=6757835&amp;page=1">Live Like an Illegal Immigrant in Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Barnier, ABC News, February 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They walked through the cold night for hours with just a flashlight, led by a trained guide, or coyote, as they are known, through the thick woods.</p>
<p>They tried to escape the &#8220;migra,&#8221; slang for border patrol, to make it to their dreamland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody tried to cross the line?&#8221; a migra officer asked while browsing through the bush. &#8220;If you hear me, please show up or surrender. Please return to Mexico or come here; we can take you back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the patrol, the loud sirens and the gunshots, what took place that night in the woods of Parque Eco Alberto, in the Hidalgo State of Mexico, was just a game, a theme attraction called &#8220;Caminata Nocturna,&#8221; or the &#8220;Night Hike.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event was organized by members of the indigenous Notomi tribe to show people what it&rsquo;s like to cross the Rio Grande illegally.</p>
<p>While the group of young people that ABC News followed that night was hiding in the bush, half a dozen fake border patrol officers stormed in on four illegal immigrants, who were played by actors.</p>
<p>The migra grabbed them violently, pushed them to the ground and handcuffed them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The four men were then hauled onto the platform of a pickup truck and &#8220;deported.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Caminata is not exactly what most people would want for a weekend out in Mexico; temperatures were in the low 40s in Parque Eco Alberto that night, the ride takes four hours and the path is slippery. Still, about 40 young people that night paid around $10 for the hike.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then, to escape the migra, the group hid inside a dark narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t listen to those coyotes,&#8221; a migra officer said through a bullhorn. &#8220;Those people don&rsquo;t care about you, they only care about your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Training camp for illegal immigrants?</b></p>
<p>Critics of the game say this is really a training camp for illegal immigrants, but one of the coyotes that night said it&rsquo;s the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Asked what his message was to the participants that night, he said: &#8220;That they should not do it for real. It shows them how dangerous it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the Caminata coyotes have actually crossed the Mexican-U.S. border without documents in the past.</p>

			<p>The Mexican Government has long supported illegal immigration into this Country, and shame on them. </p>
<p>Currently, American tax-dollars, and American men and women under arms (a literal Army of DEA and Special Forces operatives are in Mexico keeping their drug-lords from taking over completely), prop up the Mexican Government, and as long as illegals stream into this Country, that is simply criminal. </p>
<p>Were SouthernJew President, here would by my quick fix:<br>
1) Withdraw all United States drug enforcement and Special Forces troops out of Mexico.<br>
2) Immediately cut all Federal aid to Mexico.<br>
3) Place National Guard troops on the border, and use the money saved from Steps 1 &amp; 2 to fund their presence. <br>
4) Insist that Mexico cut the number of illegals by 1/4 in six months, and by 1/2 in twelve months and all together in 24 months, before these restrictions are removed. </p>
<p>Mexico cannot exist without American tax-dollars and American agents and troops. The fact that we allow them to actively undermine our National Security by allowing illegal immigration is simply astounding. </p>

			<p>A sure sign of a nation mired in poverty that such an amusement park can operate at a profit.</p>

			<p>I can hardly wait until they begin another game called the Failed State.</p>
<p>It goes something like this:  A group of Mexicans occupies a plush villa by the sea, wining and dining on fine food, living a life of luxury, and a group of peons outside try to get a job there by persuading the host to hire them, without getting kicked out on their butts, but no one is ever successfully employed.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about trying to survive in a narco state that has untold wealth from natural resources and drug money, but the elites are so corrupt and stupid they don&rsquo;t have any jobs to offer, so they give the peons directions on how to cross the border into another country.  That&rsquo;s called diverting crime and poverty, and a free pass to Gringoland is issued to each one.  The peon players are penalized 5 points, and the elites get 100 points and an AK47. </p>
<p>Then, after the peons get settled across the border, they put their Mexican flag on the wall to show how proud they are of their country. And that&rsquo;s called stupidity. And they get 100 points for that, so they lose by 5 points.</p>

			<p>These could be the first rough performances of the central ritual of another secular religion in the making.</p>
<p>U.S. blacks have their slavery/segregation/MLK Jr. cult with its mythologized narratives, Jews have the reverence in which their WWII experiences are held, and now the Mexicans will have this allegory of suffering and eventual attainment of the promised land (for some).</p>
<p>Jews may stick to what they have, but what could the rest of us whites come up with in the great secular-religion contest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see ours include crucifixes with different sorts of whites nailed up there in the place of the Savior: a professional engineering looking type with pocket protector, a working man with hard hat, etc.etc.</p>
