<h1>California May Have to Cut Prison Population by 40 Percent</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal judges tentatively ruled on Monday that California must reduce the number of inmates in its overcrowded prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>California state officials, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, immediately promised to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor and I strongly disagree with this ruling,&#8221; said Matthew Cate, California&rsquo;s corrections and rehabilitation secretary. Implementing the court&rsquo;s ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released, Cate said, describing it as a threat to public safety.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In court documents, the judges said the state&rsquo;s prison system was at about 200 percent of capacity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The judges said their ruling is tentative so that the parties involved can plan accordingly, essentially giving them an opportunity to work things out themselves before an official ruling is rendered. The court suggests a two- to three-year window for reducing the number of prisoners in the system.</p>
<p>Those who would be released would be very low risk, according to Don Specter, director of the Prison Law Office, a group that provides free legal services to California prisoners. He said the ruling would affect those in jail for three or four months because of parole violations, those getting early release dates, and those who might qualify for early release for taking part in rehabilitation programs.</p>
<p>A final ruling also probably would reduce the number of people entering the prison system, with many being diverted through the courts and into rehabilitation programs instead of going to jail, Specter said.<br>

			<p>This would be pure insanity.  They are criminals, they put themselves there by their criminal acts.  They deserve just what they get, and if the prisons are too crowded, just do what Joe Arapio does and put up tents.  No air conditioning, no cable TV, no canteen call, no hot meals and no hot showers.  Just another example of liberal judges ruining the country. If they think so much of the criminals&rsquo; rights, may I suggest they share they own homes with them.  </p>

			<p>California is a State that some person who has writing skills should write a book about. It could be called, &#8220;How NOT to run a State.&#8221; I mean, just about everything the state and city governments do in California is criminally wrong. It would be a best seller, I&rsquo;m sure.     </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that these judges value the &#8220;rights&#8221; of criminals over that of the rest of the population:<br>
Then again, it&rsquo;s probably easy to do that when you live in a gated neighbourhood, right?</p>

<p>Anyone got any statistics on the recidivism rates of participants in these &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; programs?

			<p>The perfect solution for over-crowded California prison? Immediately deport each and every illegal immigrant in the prison system. And continue to deport each and every illegal immigrant arrested throughout that State. </p>
<p>Of course, such a sound and decent proposal would immediately be called racist by liberals and their media, and so instead of reducing prison numbers by deporting illegals, California shall decrease prison numbers by releasing felons into society. Tragic, indeed, for the many people (likely White) who will be victimised by these violent offenders.</p>

			<p>The three-judge panel made the suggestion that the state should grant parole more generously.  And it looks like that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll have to do.</p>
<p>What they so conveniently forget is that the only reason parole (and probation) has any effectiveness is the fear of returning (or going) to prison.  If they&rsquo;re let out on parole because of overcrowding, and they know they won&rsquo;t go back, what good will parole be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to become the case in California that the only convicts that even go to prison those convicted of murder, rape, homophobia or being white.</p>

			<p>It has taken two years to get to this point. If it takes another 2-3 years, those in prison with medical and mental health issues will continue to be neglected. 5 years can cause a lot of deaths and injuries. The stories I have heard are horrendous. One person I talked to told me about their son being told they have constipation when really having cancerous tumors. Once released, he found out about the tumor and had surgery. What if he would have had a longer sentance? Seeing a doctor can take weeks to months. Getting treatment, longer. I have a friend in prison that after 7 months will get a liver biopsy. If it&rsquo;s not cancelled again. He should have been placed in a drug rehab program, instead received 3 years. There are many stories like this if it were investigated. Unfortunately, because these individuals are prisoners and &#8220;justly placed&#8221; much of society believes that whatever they get (negatively) is just deserved. </p>

			<p>I doubt the higher courts will prevent the release of these people, so this is just one more important degradation of Californian society.</p>
<p>The state is almost defunct monitarily, and it is totally defunct as a bastion of free thought, so it might as well secede as Hawaii wants to do, so we can get rid of 30 million flakes, oddballs, and misfits, minus the decent whites who live there and will relocate to another state.</p>

			<p>&hellip;.And all at a time when we could increase the prison population by 40% if they&rsquo;d just enforce the laws.  Oh, and I totally trust them when they say that the million or so criminals that they&rsquo;d like to release are &#8216;non-violent&rsquo;.  But then again, I&rsquo;m sure that the members of the Prison Board live comfortably at a distance from anywhere that these &#8216;rehabilitated, non-violent&rsquo; criminals will be roaming the streets.</p>

			<p>There are many signs of a society in very sharp decline; one with severely eroded standards. This is one of those signs.</p>
<p>A strong, desirable nation has healthy, high standards and morals. A weak, undesirable nation defines down deviancy to the norms. The USA has gradually become the latter over the past 40 to 50 years. The decline has greatly accelerated in the last decade. Today, the nation resembles Africa more than it resembles the USA, circa 1950.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Implementing the court&rsquo;s ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released&hellip;a threat to public safety&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If this is not a call for arming oneself with deadly force I don&rsquo;t know what is. If the government refuses to protect me and my loved ones who will?</p>
<p>As Frosty Wooldridge reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;loss of the rule-of-law that strangles most Third World countries is now moving methodically into the United States&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No mention of the percentage of prisoners in California who are illegal immigrants and should be immediately deported  &mdash;  this is CNN, the Communist News Network, after all.</p>
<p>From Vdare.com&rsquo;s Brenda Walker:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The numbers can look staggering. Nearly 20,000 inmates in California&rsquo;s state prison system have ICE holds on them, meaning there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;re illegal immigrants. More than 3,000 of those inmates are serving time for murder&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frosty also writes:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Illegal alien criminals fill a whopping 29 percent of America&rsquo;s state and federal prisons&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is the USG allowing this?  Is it one more way to bring down and destroy Whites?  I can&rsquo;t come up with any other reason for the USG to put the rights of illegal aliens ahead and above that of native US citizens.</p>

			<p>Of course, incarceration is a very expensive business - an expense that eats a lot of tax but gives nothing back in return.<br>
 America&rsquo;s current social model calls for a very high rate of incarceration to somehow keep the lid on the pressure cooker - this is now unfinanciable.<br>
 The underlying cause is deeper than policy can reach, therefore the dilemma is insoluble.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve proposed this before and they dont do it simply because their governments wont take them back. Think about would take back thieves, murders, rapist, drug dealers, and uneducated folks back into your country. Especially if they are being dumped off in a country you dislike and know they will drag it down.<br>

I&rsquo;m not against releasing &#8216;non-violent&rsquo; offenders per say, on the condition that they live in the communities of the people demanding their release.</p>
<p>If blacks believe there are too many black males in prison, release them and let them live their &#8216;non-violent&rsquo; criminal lives in black neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>Yet another proof that all Liberals should be completely separated from power in a civilized society.</p>
<p>Here you see the Liberal &#8220;axiom&#8221; of co-existence of the law abiding with criminal elements at work.</p>
<p>Rather than punish criminals harshly, which measure typically leads to decline in population of those whose genetic composition predisposes them to the lawbreaking (remember how Sweden eradicated theft in the medieval times?), they invented such absurd ideas like &#8220;paying debth to the society&#8221; makes a good guy out of lawbreaker (as if raping someone equalled to taking a social loan) or that education should replace punishment. (The above are but two examples of many.)</p>
<p>Now the incoherent system built on false dogmata is collapsing. And that is the way it always has been with the Liberal ideology.</p>
<p>I know some of you, ladies and gentlemen of this forum, are Liberals, but Liberalism is a deadly disease of the American society. Our country will become a specimen of oppression if we don&rsquo;t stop Liberalism from its progress (towards our death) now.<br>

<p><i>Posted by Kenelm Digby at 5:12 AM on February 11</i></p>
<p>This is flawed argument: the conclusion doesn&rsquo;t follow from the premise.</p>
<p>If incarceration becomes impractical for whatever reason, more draconnian means should be implemented. </p>
<p>Mind you that there is no credible evidence to the Liberal claim that solving &#8220;social problems&#8221; will eliminate (or significanltly reduce) crime. Certainly, giving thieves free money will keep them from stealing for a while, but eventually they will either lose them or expect more than the society can afford, and then they will resort back to stealing.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not an &#8220;imperfect&#8221; society that is the &#8220;root cause&#8221; of crime; it&rsquo;s the genetically and sub-culturally predetermined nature of those who weren&rsquo;t born to obey the law. And as long as enough of these individuals live with us, a disaster (like the one described in this article) is waithing to happen.<br>

			<p>A Reader&rsquo;s comment above got me to thinking.</p>
<p>It used to be that we got by with a relatively low prison population.  How was it that a state like Mississippi could have the lowest murder rate in the country in 1900 and have the highest in 2000?  When there are probably more prisoners in raw numbers and per capita, and more prisons, in 2000 than 1900.  What is relatively constant is the percentage of the population that is black.  My theory is that the segregationist system created such fear in the minds of the state&rsquo;s black population, that the punishment for misbehaving was the sure and steady beatdown from an angry white cop who had no fear of civil rights lawsuits, poverty centers or defamation leagues, that they behaved fairly well.  Therefore, there wasn&rsquo;t that much need for formal incarceration.</p>
<p>The 13th Amendment to the Const. allows for slavery as a punishment for crime.  I suggest we do just that   &mdash;   certain convicts who might be sent to jail or prison, who wouldn&rsquo;t be a risk to hurt anyone or steal anything, should be made to serve someone, e.g. infirmed elderly people.</p>

<p><i>Posted by sbuffalonative at 11:02 AM on February 11 </i></p>
<p>I see a major problem here (which pertains to letting the convicts out on parole, too): once they are out of jail they can multiply as they please, thus passing their presumably crime-ridden genes on their offspring.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the only rational way to rid a civilized society of crime is to make criminal behavior maladaptive (to reduce chances for criminals to have kids, that is). The current dealing with crime (I credit mostly Liberals for it) does the opposite: by means of social services and benefits they make (at least some) lawbreaking adaptive.</p>
<p>And this is as absurd as it gets.</p>
<p>(I hope this adds to points makes by <i>Question Diversity at 3:15 PM on February 11</i> as well.)</p>

			<p>Personally, I believe all prisoners should be released and elected to public office all across the nation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way we&rsquo;re going to improve the quality of our representation, because decent people won&rsquo;t run for office.</p>
<p>This way there would be a slight improvement at least.</p>

			<p>Part of the problem here is the mandatory minimum sentences California has for non-violent drug offenses.  These pack the prisons by making it impossible for judges to prioritize who should be locked up and for how long.</p>
<p>Another part of the problem are the &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221;, like San Francisco.  These make it impossible for illegal aliens arrested for minor offenses to be deported.  Instead, they&rsquo;re put right back into circulation until they&rsquo;re arrested for major crimes, which they commit at sky-high rates, judging by the fact that 29% of the US state and federal prison population consists of illegal aliens.</p>

			<p> In Japan, all prisoners do their time in solitary. They are not allowed to read newspapers, watch television, or even talk to others. The recidivism rate is less than ten percent. Why can&rsquo;t California at least try to emulate what Sheriff Joe Arpaio is doing in Arizona ? </p>

<p>Never happen. The damned liberals (fools) would fight it tooth and nail! Imagine the nerve of common people. . Expecting, DEMANDING that convicts repay society not just for their crime, but for the cost of their incarceration.</p>
<p>Seriously, I suggested this many times in posts. That convicts be allowed to work (under guard) for business and agriculture. Earning a day OFF their sentence for each day worked. But that is far too sensible for our braindead (liberal) politicians. Of course the NAACP and La Raza would have foam-at-the-mouth fits, as well. Given Blacks and Hispanics form so much of the prison population.</p>

			<p>We are flooded with blacks and latino gangmembers that cost too much to incarcerate. So it&rsquo;s back to the revolving door policy of the 70&rsquo;s I guess. You remember, the policy that brought us the gangster 80&rsquo;s.</p>
