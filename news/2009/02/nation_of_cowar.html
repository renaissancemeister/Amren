			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Mac Donald, City Journal, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder &hellip; recently told his Justice Department employees that the United States was a &#8220;nation of cowards&#8221; for not talking more about race. {snip}</p>
<p>Is he nuts? Leave aside for a moment Holder&rsquo;s purely decorative call for a &#8220;frank&#8221; conversation about race. The Clinton-era Conversation also purported to be frank, and we know what that meant: a one-sided litany of white injustices. {snip}</p>
<p>Not only do colleges, law schools, almost all of the nation&rsquo;s elite public and private high schools, and the mainstream media, among others, have &#8220;conversations about &hellip; racial matters&#8221;; they never stop talking about them. Any student who graduates from a moderately selective college without hearing that its black students are victims of institutional racism  &mdash;  notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of black students there will have been deliberately admitted with radically lower SAT scores than their white and Asian comrades  &mdash;  has been in a coma throughout his time there.</p>
<p>Education bureaucrats maintain an incessant harangue on white racism because they see the writing on the wall: most students are indifferent to race and just want to get along. If left to themselves, they would go about their business perfectly happily and color-blindly, and the race industry would wither on the vine. Thus the institutional imperative to remind black students constantly about their victimization and the white students about their guilt. Last month, the elite Phillips Academy at Andover proudly announced a student presentation on White Privilege: A History and Its Role in Education. Would the student have come up with such a topic on her own without the school&rsquo;s educators deliberately immersing her in such trivial matters? Of course not.</p>
<p>But if Attorney General Holder is really sincere about wanting a &#8220;frank&#8221; conversation about race, he should put the following items on the agenda:</p>
<p>The American electorate. The country just elected its first black president. And it actually didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about Barack Obama&rsquo;s race during the election, thank heavens, because most Americans were more interested in the candidate&rsquo;s ideas than in his skin color. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crime. Holder told his Justice Department employees that they had a special responsibility to advance racial understanding, according to the Associated Press. Uh-oh. Before and during Holder&rsquo;s first stint at Justice, when he served as Clinton&rsquo;s deputy attorney general, the department&rsquo;s civil rights division specialized in slapping onerous federal consent decrees on police departments. Its assumption was that racial disparities in cops&rsquo; stop-and-arrest rates reflected police racism, not racial disparities in crime rates.</p>
<p>Before Holder and his attorneys revive that practice, they should study certain facts that remain taboo in the mainstream media. For instance, the homicide rate for black men between the ages of 18 and 24 is well over ten times that of whites. {snip} In New York City, one of the nation&rsquo;s safest large cities, 83 percent of all gun assailants were black during the first six months of 2008, according to victims and witnesses, though blacks make up only 24 percent of the city&rsquo;s population. Add Hispanic perps, and you account for 98 percent of all shootings in New York City. The face of violent crime in cities is almost exclusively black or brown. {snip}</p>
<p>Education. Commentators on NPR&rsquo;s &#8220;black&#8221; show, News and Notes, recently groused about the lack of black policy experts on the Sunday talk shows but ignored the possibility that the education gap might have something to do with it. {snip} The black high school drop-out rate approaches 50 percent. On the 2006 SAT, the average score in the critical-reading section was 434 for blacks, 527 for whites, and 510 for Asians; in the math section, 429 for blacks, 536 for whites, and 587 for Asians; and in the writing section, 428 for blacks, 519 for whites, and 512 for Asians. America&rsquo;s lousy showing in international math, science, and reading tests compared with Japan and Western Europe is influenced in large part by the low scores of blacks and Hispanics. {snip}</p>
<p>Likewise, after their first year of legal education, 51 percent of blacks labor in the bottom tenth of their class; two-thirds reside in the bottom fifth. Blacks are four times as likely as whites to fail the bar exam on the first try. {snip} Perhaps Holder could confront the stigma against academic achievement among many black youth, who deride studying and staying out of trouble as &#8220;acting white.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family. Closing the educational achievement gap will be difficult as long as the black illegitimacy rate is nearly 71 percent, compared with a white rate of 26 percent. Taxpayers foot the bill for this family breakdown  &mdash;  when fatherless children who never learned self-control and self-discipline disrupt classrooms and prevent other children from learning, and when the same fatherless children get sucked up into gang life and fail to connect with the world of work and responsibility. Many poor single mothers work heroically to raise law-abiding sons, but the odds are against them.</p>
<p>When communities resist an influx of Section 8 housing-voucher holders from the inner city, say, they are reacting overwhelmingly to behavior. Skin color is a proxy for that behavior. If inner-city blacks behaved like Asians  &mdash;  cramming as much knowledge into their kids as they can possibly fit into their skulls  &mdash;  the lingering wariness towards lower-income blacks that many Americans unquestionably harbor would disappear. {snip} If Eric Holder wants to crank up our racial preoccupations even further, let him at least do so with a full airing of the facts.</p>

<p>I slightly disagree with this part.  I don&rsquo;t think that &#8220;educational bureaucrats&#8221; do this because most students &#8220;want to get along,&#8221; it&rsquo;s because white nationalism and/or race realism is the biggest threat to plutocratic universalism.  In other words, rich people might make a little less money.</p>

			<p> The only way race can be discussed with other races is for the white man to keep his mouth shut, accept all abuse from the other races and beg forgiveness for all the sins committed by whites against blacks. Any word of protest and he is instantly labeled a racist, loses his job and is placed under intense investigation by every branch of the government at all levels.<br>

			<p>Memo to mr. holder:</p>
<p><br>
1) to be perfectly honest, you are an incompetent afirmative action attorney general.</p>
<p>2) it is not in your job description as attorney general to discuss who people want to hang around with.</p>
<p>3) and to be perfectly honest about race, let me say the following: I deeply dislike blacks such as yourself, who never cease to be the victim, even as you stand in front of the country as attorney general, and proceed to make a complete fool of yourself.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Add Hispanic perps [to blacks], and you account for 98 percent of all shootings in New York City.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This is probably the national average.  So the next time the militant Gun Abolitionist quote some data to make it difficult to own a gun, tell them to just collect from blacks and Hispanics.<br>

			<p>Mr. Holder is mistaken.</p>
<p>We do not need a dialog on the subject of &#8220;race&#8221;. I have already heard what &#8220;they&#8221; have to say many times&hellip;.and I am totally convinced they do not want to hear what I have to say.<br>

			<p>My experience is that blacks consider a discussion about race to be &#8220;frank&#8221; when they can hold the floor throughout about how evil and &#8220;racist&#8221; white folks are while the white folks hang their heads in shame and keep their mouths shut (oh, maybe every once in a while looking up guiltily and whispering, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; So sorry&hellip;&#8221;).  <p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more of such &#8220;frank&#8221; discussions, and I sure won&rsquo;t be listening to any.</p></p>

			<p>As usual, Heather McDonald tells it like it is&hellip;&hellip;at least as much as she can.  </p>
<p>You know, I really believe that nearly all blacks sincerely believe they have to be twice as qualified as a white to get a position, and the reason for it is their inability to reason in logical terms and their lack of intellect, both supported by black arrogance which is quite common among the entire population.</p>
<p>I further believe that they think that they could do any job a white has right now.  All they need to do is look the part.  FOr example if they wore a suit and tie, carried a briefcase and sometimes wore spectacles, that&rsquo;s all that is necessary to be a lawyer or another type of professional person.</p>
<p>Jesse and Al want to get blacks in every position that whites are in right now in every field, thinking they are denied positions simply because their black. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s important to constantly point out that it isn&rsquo;t just whites blacks can&rsquo;t measure up to it&rsquo;s all races.  Everytime they talk about the black white racial gap they should be reminded there is also a black/Hispanic gap too, as well as a black and everybody else besides white gap.  Whites are too spineless to point this out.  It needs to be repeated again and again and again and again, until it is known by every person in the world.</p>
<p>And Holder should be reminded that there is a far greater conflict and &#8220;gap&#8221; between blacks and mestizos because they don&rsquo;t allow each other into their neighborhoods, and murders occur quite often, and their gangs are all about the racial divide, which obviously is an extension of how both communities feel about each other racially.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out repeatedly that blacks need a dialogue between blacks and everybody else, especially Hispanics, much more than one is needed with whites.</p>
<p>But to get this across to them, we need high profile whites who aren&rsquo;t too spineless to point all this out.</p>

			<p>Here we go again,  &#8220;all blacks are victims or love to practice &#8220;victimology&#8221;, even the very rich blacks.</p>
<p>Rep. Clyburn, the highest ranking black in congress is in full agreement with Holder. And if  Mr.Holder doesn&rsquo;t like this then please &#8220;pardon me&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I really don&rsquo;t think Mr. Holder would like to hear what whites really have to say about race relations, starting with crime and ending with the abject failure of blaks  despite the endless amount of aid and attention and their complete lack of personal responsibility, it would be a very bleak and depressing conversation.</p>

			<p>So the &#8220;black leadership&#8221; of this country would like a &#8220;frank discussion&#8221; about race?</p>
<p>Well, last night on &#8220;Hardball&#8221; Professor Michael E. Dyson, got his head handed to him by Mr. Patrick J. Buchanan on this topic. It was so obvious who had won the debate, that even Chris Matthews&rsquo; sorry surrogate Mike Barnacle, could not prop up Comrade Dyson.</p>
<p>View for yourselves, and draw your own conclusions, as to where both the cowardice and outright lies are to be found:</p>

			<p>     Ms McDonald is only begining her journey to Realization. <br>
There was no need to talk about race during the Campaign because<br>
the whole thing was about race; a fish can&rsquo;t see water because <br>
the water is everywhere. His ideas? What ideas? He&rsquo;s Black-he<br>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s some honest discussion for you Mr. Holder about racial divides. Stop shouting racism when we point out the truth about blacks. Stop the drug dealing and gang banging and get a real job. Stop passing down the poverty and illegitimacy, this is 2009 not 1950.. you have the same opportunties as whites. Stop pretending there is not a seriuos AIDS epidimic in the black commuinty, and for God sakes stop having children you neither want nor can afford. And if you DO have children, step up and take care of them. Are you sure you want to have this conversation Mr. Holder?</p>

			<p>I wish Mr. Holder could have been with me and my wife the night we were surrounded by two carloads of black gangsters in the parking lot of Krogers in Brentwood TN. I left my vehicle and confronted these predators single handed. Fortunately, my wife was on her cell phone summoning the police. With that act, the barbarians scurried away and we were free. Call me fool Mr. Holders but never a coward!</p>

			<p>Holder is from Barbados, Obama is Kenyan, both were nurtured in the afrocentric hate American education of the 80s and 90s stewed in cultural relativity gobbledygook and critical legal theory and oppression studies. African mulattoes of of that generation are complete ideologues, Marxist zealots, and with the melanin added afromarxist anti white European bigots.</p>

<p>When is the next conference? I think Jared Taylor should make Eric Holder the keynote speaker. Then Jared can open up the floor to questions and Eric Holder will get an honest discussion on race beyond his wildest dreams.</p>

			<p>On CNN last night a short discussion featuring one man in three, Roland Martin made it extremely clear why we Whites have already shrugged our shoulders and walked away from the conversation.  When the only White man of the three mentioned Borak Obama without his royal title &#8220;president&#8221; - Martin demanded curtly that he say it and say it clearly &#8220;President Borak Obama.&#8221;  Martin and the other forgettable Black expert were so in your face with their projected expectations of what their view of the racial conversation ought to be that I have little doubt it put the seal on any discussion that might have been.  Who wants to talk to a beligerant, demanding, in-your-face Black racist who can&rsquo;t see his own racism?</p>

			<p>I grew up in and around Civil War battlefields, memorials and National Cemeteries. I am literally steeped in the Civil War. Although a proud, unrepentant secessionist (getting out from under the District&rsquo;s insanity is as wise today as it was then) let me remind Mr. Holder that America spent the blood and treasure of 600,000 of it&rsquo;s best in a WAR that decided the issue of race. That number &hellip; 600,000 doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe the actual cost &hellip; the women, wives, children, homes, farms and businesses that were ruined, destroyed and dislocated is exponentially greater. And the number of hideously wounded, disfigured and maimed is greater still.</p>
<p>Cowards???</p>
<p>COWARDS???</p>
<p>You should be thanking Almighty God you live in a nation where it&rsquo;s citizens willfully paid such a price for your freedom. How about a thank you, instead of calling us cowards?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m appalled at the stupendous depths of ignorance, hostility, self-absorption and twisted psychosis Mr. Holder has achieved. But then, I may have to forgive him if he wuz edicated in our federaly dunded pubic skrools.</p>

			<p>There is no such thing as a &#8220;dialogue about race&#8221;. There is only chastisement and the making of demands.  Progressively making society  more inhospitable to us over time by manipulating public and private policies.  Progressive socio-econnomic degradation system for whites an America with the very intention of becoming worse over time as the various ethnic groups grow in size and power.  </p>

			<p>You know, many Americans might be cowards about a variety of issues, but discussing racism with black folks isn&rsquo;t one of them.<br>
What not discussing racism with black folks is, is common sense and forsight. Touch the stove, you get burned, go out in the rain without and umbrella, you get wet,etc.etc. </p>

			<p>John PM thanks for that link.  That was interesting.  Pat is a very effective speaker.  Dyson uses a lot of cant speech.  Dyson doesn&rsquo;t follow the conversation; instead, he just rolls into a trite speech.  When Pat asserted whites are not the cause of a 70% illegitamacy rate, and pointed out black leadership failed to address the 70% illegitamacy rate, Dyson responded Jesse Jackson is addressing it.  What!  That is preposterous. Jesse Jackson has never addressed that issue.  In fact, Jackson attacks anyone, including Obama, that even slightly addresses the issue.  Dyson, as usual, offered no substantive rebuttal, only empty platitudes.   </p>

			<p>I watched that Pat Buchanan/Michael Dyson video link that John PM posted.  Good stuff.  I wonder though, how many Whites are actually aware of those kinds of statistics on crime and other pathologies?  The only places I see these things mentioned are hard right and racialist magazines and websites.  Are they common knowledge on talk stations?  I don&rsquo;t listen to the radio and I quit reading newspapers, so I am wholly ignorant of what passes for conservative thought these days.  Of course, everybody except medical researchers in Atlanta know that Blacks commit a lot of mayhem, but do Whites know the actual numbers?  </p>

<p>Folks, the blacks in law school are those who voluntarily went to college and graduated then voluntarily went to law school. Even if they were &#8216;helped&rsquo; with their college studies, these are not the blacks who view education as a &#8216;white&rsquo; thing. This is the cream-of-the-crop of the black community. Granted this is also a high level white sample. We have the best of the white and black populations and we find most of the blacks (67%) at the bottom of the class.</p>
<p>So &hellip; care to comment Mr. Holder?</p>

			<p>Being more familiar with the subject and agenda of the &ldquo;Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism&rdquo; than the average white individual that one might encounter on the street, it is clearly obvious to me that this Barack Obama fellow was carefully groomed by the hidden Cultural Marxist string pullers, and now symbolizes the ultimate conquest of an entire White dominant nation by these evil forces.</p>
<p>His genealogy is not just a coincidence; nor is it an insignificant or minor detail. </p>
<p>Consider this, fellow AR readers:  Had a white female had not chosen to betray her own race and get sexually involved with a black man, this half-white, half-black fellow would not have existed, and our Cultural Marxist enemies would not have had him to install into our White House.    I contend that this is part of the sick, twisted, sense of perverted humor of these Cultural Marxists.   Placing a black man into a position of power over an entire white dominant nation – wasn&rsquo;t enough.  It had to be a guy who was the product of one of our women going to bed with a black, because this increases the symbolism that these Cultural Marxists revel in most – which is to rub the hated white man&rsquo;s nose in his own subjugation and defeat.</p>
<p>Therefore, what Mr. Holder and his fan club are really saying when they call America (Make that White America) a nation of cowards – this is merely an extension of the gloating of the Cultural Marxist ideologues, because of how easily they were able to steal both the women and the nation of the White Man.  They  pulled this off, not by force of arms on a field of battle, but with simple words – like &lsquo;racist&rsquo; and &lsquo;bigot&rsquo; and the usual collection of racial intimidation expressions.  </p>
<p>Symbolism is important to these people, friends.  As is boasting about how they stomped our cowardly hiney&rsquo;s and stole our country from us.<br>

<p>Whites are cowards.  They will not speak out or oppose what has been done to our nation by BLACKS.  They fear loosing their jobs or white friends for speaking the truth.  Like German Jews, the White Guilt Cowards will remain silent as they climb up into the Box Cars.  WHITE COWARDS ALL.</p>

			<p>I would be interested in seeing a genetic analysis of inheritance of some of these &#8220;black&#8221; leaders.  It is obvious by the appearance of these individuals that their ancestry is diluted by a great deal of caucasian blood, but almost none from the other races of mankind.  It&rsquo;s my contention that these nouveau blacks suffer from a psychological neurosis wrought by an inability to identify with either group.  </p>

			<p>I agree that Ms McDonald is &#8220;only begining her journey to (racial) realization&#8221;. At this juncture along her path she is not a race realist but a variety of conservative who seems to believes that anyone is capable of being a rocket scientist with the virtues of a saint by exercising their freewill. She apparently believes the only thing that separates the races is melanin. In any case, it&rsquo;s refreshing to hear so much of the dialogue Holder undoubtedly ignores in the war between truth and PC. Of course, PC is meant to say only what doesn&rsquo;t hurt people&rsquo;s feeling where the truth is subsidiary. I heard Ms. McDonald on the radio and she is quite an articulate woman. </p>

			<p>Holder&rsquo;s absolutely right, we should have a dialogue on race that frankly addresses the irrefutable facts of black criminality (eight times the level of whites and Hispanics combined), black illegitimacy, one-parent black households, and most unmentionable of all, low average levels of black intelligence as clearly established by a century of IQ testing in all parts of the world.</p>
<p>These issues should be central to any discussion of race in this country.  They&rsquo;re in fact the core issues in any discussion of race.</p>

<p>This Dyson on the video is a typical example of black inability to use adequate logic for problem solving.  </p>
<p>Like ALL blacks I see on T.V. debating a point, he thinks the way to debate is to talk more and over the other person and whoever pushes the most words across his lips is the winner, like in a basketball or baseball game.</p>
<p>This character did far more harm to his cause by ignorantly refusing to do anything but attack all whites for every ill of blacks, even crime and out of wedlock births. </p>
<p>Anybody that has him on their program for debate surely must do so purposely in order to make blacks look even worse than they already do.</p>
<p>He has a rapid fire verbal approach on race that has been rattled off thousands of times before, and with all the practice he has had trashing whitey he knows his script by memory.  I have no doubt he would sound even more like an assinine fool if he were forced to debate any other subject or ideas.</p>
<p>His is the ugly face of black hate and unreasonable ideas that reveal the impossibility in trying to get blacks to confront the race issue honestly.  In addition to his unreasonable hatred, I think he&rsquo;s too dense to understand anything beyond a basic level and has, like all blacks, a problem with abstract thought.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the perfect black example to reveal to white Americans the folly of including blacks in anything.  I&rsquo;d like to see him do more interviews on the T.V. talk shows.</p>

			<p>This is true we need an open discussion. But not with the likes of people on this website. They are over critical and have suddle racism towards blacks. We need people like Pat Buchanan who will tell the truth using researched facts and not biased sterotypes. Most blacks are extremely critical of the actions of their fellow blacks. Most will speak of the many problems that blacks are causing. Most dont ride the victim train. Most importantly most dont commit crimes. Blacks are just more prone to but it is not a representation of the majority of them. I&rsquo;d know I grew up in a black neighborhood.</p>

Perhaps we can have a frank discussion on race if Attorney General Holder takes the gun from our heads.  Until then he&rsquo;s merely engaging in race baiting and his &#8220;invitation&#8221; is merely an invitation to destruction.</p>

			<p>Attorney General Eric Holder must be replaced because of his insulting and shortsighted remarks concerning race. </p>
<p>Insulting, because the descendants of the several hundred thousand white Americans who died in the Civil War to eliminate bondage and to set free all slaves are not cowards; nor are they descended from cowards.</p>
<p>Insulting, because the brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of the millions of white American soldiers who fought and died to eliminate racism in World War 2 are not cowards; nor were their fallen loved ones cowards.</p>
<p>Shortsighted, because Eric Holder states:  &ldquo;&hellip; the workplace is largely integrated, but Americans still self-segregate on the weekends and in their private lives.&rdquo;  (self-segregate in private at home, as opposed to government forced integration at work)  Apparently, Holder is unable to grasp the obvious meaning of such behavior, which speaks volumes about the intelligence of Holder and therefore about his fitness for the public service job of Attorney General.<br>

<p>What you say is wrong. Most blacks are extremely critical of other blacks? Hardly. They always rationalize and make excuses for themselves and rally to the tribal call. Look how black jurors engage in acquittals and nullification all the time. You say you grew up in a black neighbourhood? Unless you are yourself black I doubt that very much. I think you are a fabricator.</p>

			<p>Message to rational thinker: Your post has it completley backwards. The main problem I see in the black community is their propensity to Circle The Wagons. By this I mean the vast majority of the black community from the lowest underclass bum in the street to the highest earning best educated black executive will rally around a black criminal who has committed a most heinous crime, even if it is against another black. This is all the more true if there is widespread popular outrage or the victims are non blacks.You rarely if ever see this amongst other racial groups.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We did have a national dialogue on race &mdash; it was called Gettysberg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry if this is off-topic, but I&rsquo;ve got to point out that the War Between The States was not about slavery. The only side fighting for &#8220;emancipation&#8221; was the South  &mdash;  their own emancipation from Federal tyranny. Slavery was one of many precipitating factors in the SECESSION, but Lincoln INVADED the South in order to force them back into the Union, not to free the slaves. Race had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>As for Gettysburg, it was a disaster  &mdash;  perhaps the most important battle in the history of the American Republic. The defeat of the South led directly to the rise of the predatory capitalist system and the corrupt, incompetent Federal government we see today  &mdash;  a government typified by characters like Eric Holder. If Lee had borrowed some of Nathan Bedford Forrest&rsquo;s guerrilla tactics instead of marching his soldiers across a field against an entrenched opponent, the Republic might have survived and we wouldn&rsquo;t be listening to Holder today.</p>

<p>The one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about your posts is that they&rsquo;re irrational&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;usually always.</p>
<p>And, there&rsquo;s nothing subtle about the anti-black bias on here, my friend.  People come right out and announce certain black pathologies, lack of intelligence, and they also reveal openly they think even less of black propensity for crime and violence.  If you think anyone is being subtle, I would suggest you take a course in reading comprehension.  The people here couldn&rsquo;t be more straight forward and honest.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like blacks for very good reasons, and we say so pointedly.  &#8220;Overly critical&#8221; of blacks is something that doesn&rsquo;t exist here either.  Every word written or uttered that reveals the many outrageousness by blacks if anything is understated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need people like Pat Buchanan who will tell the truth using researched facts and not biased sterotypes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan would agree with everything written on here also, and it&rsquo;s the proven truth when it comes to blacks. Here&rsquo;s a question for you, though.  When you say &#8220;we,&#8221; are you trying to get us to believe you&rsquo;re not black?  It&rsquo;s pretty obvious you are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most blacks are extremely critical of the actions of their fellow blacks. Most will speak of the many problems that blacks are causing. Most dont ride the victim train.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most all blacks refuse to admit to the truth, and none of them will agree that blacks are at fault in anything they do, no matter how heinous, including assault, rape and murder.  Most all blacks try to excuse their criminal behavior, and that of other blacks. Most all blacks claim themselves to be victims and look to blame whites for every ill they have that is nobody&rsquo;s fault but their own.  It&rsquo;s truly disgusting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most importantly most dont commit crimes. Blacks are just more prone to but it is not a representation of the majority of them. I&rsquo;d know I grew up in a black neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody on here said all blacks commit crimes.  However, FBI statistics reveal that 58% of all violent crime is committed by blacks.  And as a black person, it would be expected that you grew up in a black neighborhood.  But even if you were white, what you say doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.   Any white who grows up in a black neighborhood and likes it is one who likes getting his head beat on and harrassed and bullied to the nth degree, because that&rsquo;s EXACTLY what occurs to whites living in black neighborhoods.</p>

His speeches can be divided in two. One part, the &#8216;Great Black Civilizations&rsquo;, and the other part, &#8216;Evil Whites&rsquo;.

			<p>The last thing Mr. Holder and his ilk want to have is a frank discussion on race relations. They&rsquo;d have to confront the inconvenient facts Miss MacDonald pointed out in this piece, as well as those posted above by others. You may remember Clinton also wanted a &#8220;frank discussion on race&#8221; near the end of his term, but anyone with a different opinion from the doctrinaire was not invited   &mdash;   even black intellectuals such as Tom Sowell, Walter Williams, etc. were not welcomed. What Holder and his type want is Whitey to whine and grovel and have over everything in reparation. It&rsquo;s going to be a very long four years if you were born with white skin.</p>

You cannot reason with blacks, and most of them, especially the women, will get right up in your face about it. Whites like to have civilized discussions, you cannot do this with blacks, therefore we simply ignore the subject as best we can when blacks are around. </p>

We hand our country over to INVADERS on a silver platter, we allow blacks (through subversive organizations and white fools) to demand far more than they deserve or have earned. Most of their claims to greatness are easily disproved, even the dictionary has changed the meaning of words to accommodate this wicked agenda (see racism, it used to mean unwarranted dislike of a group we knew little of - Today it&rsquo;s dictionary definition is ANY negative comment regarding blacks no matter how true or verifiable).

			<p>So many black bloviators appear in the media and decry the United States as a &#8220;racist&#8221; country.  What pray tell do they think their people&rsquo;s chances would be if they never left Africa, or if they were to return today to live in Africa?  In the latter case, the Africans wouldn&rsquo;t even want them as American blacks have a reputation of being so full of themselves and are seen in quite a negative light among native Africans.</p>
<p>Other observations:</p>
<p>Ajax writes: &#8220;Americans who died in the Civil War to eliminate bondage and to set free all slaves &hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a recurring myth reinforced by our public indoctrination (&#8220;education&#8221;) establishment. The Union under Lincoln didn&rsquo;t invade the South and fight that war to free slaves.  Lincoln couldn&rsquo;t have cared less about blacks and often said as much.  That war was fought to consolidate power in the Federal government in Washington - in violation of the Constitution.  The South was fighting for the rights of the individual states to secede, an act that was certainly not prohibited by the Constitution.</p>
<p>Ajax also writes: &#8220;&hellip; the millions of white American soldiers who fought and died to eliminate racism in World War 2 &hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just wrong.  The Americans who fought in WWII did so because their government under the interventionist-socialist FDR did everything it could to goad the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor (e.g. cutting off their oil, a violation of the Neutrality Act).  FDR was in addition to being a philanderer and economic ignoramus, was also an arrogant warmonger and friend of Josef Stalin.  Japan&rsquo;s attack was FDR&rsquo;s ticket to getting into a fight with Nazi Germany, even though Nazi Germany was no threat to the United States (contrary to what we&rsquo;re told by the  Bolshevist myth-makers in the US media).  </p>
<p>How does a war &#8220;eliminate racism&#8221;?  The same way that a &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; eliminates drug use?  (Drugs will always be with us.)  Can a global &#8220;war on terror&#8221; eliminate terror? (Terror is a tactic.)</p>

			<p>The black&rsquo;s position on the sad state of their race is so weak that it will not stand-up to debate or &#8216;conversation.&rsquo;  Therefore, their common recourse is one of constant interruption or a refusal to acknowledge any factual point concerning their propensity for crime or pervasive lack of personal responsibility.  (This is clearly evident in Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s video.) In other words, conversation with them would be pointless to an intelligent person.   </p>

			<p>Most whites are cowards! It comes with a very organized agenda.The frankfurt school being just a part of it.A hundred years of beating whitey by these same people has been very successfull.It was also very easy to brainwash the minorities with the propaganda machine to instill a hate there is no cure for against whites. Also,the reason for the civil war had nothing to do with blacks.Just more proff of people who are still victims of this propaganda machine that think they have been awakened!</p>

<p>Good point. The answer is almost none. </p>
<p>How do I know? I had been a cops and courts reporter at a community newspaper. I had seen a lot of information that had made me very, very wary, but when I saw the numbers I was dumbstruck. </p>
<p>The numbers on foreclosures, wellfare, and illegitimacy were also far worse than I expected. </p>
<p>IN short, these facts are not widely known, even though we live with them every day in this country. </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Closing the educational achievement gap will be difficult as long as the black illegitimacy rate is nearly 71 percent, compared with a white rate of 26 percent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The achievement gap is not predicated on black illegitimacy; it is what it is because of average black IQs of 85 as compared to average White IQs of 100. Closing the achievement gap is not &#8216;difficult&rsquo;, it is not possible.  </p>
<p>No amount of money, no educational program will close this gap as it is intractable.  </p>
<p>I am a huge fan of Heather McDonald&rsquo;s writings.  Her best piece IMO is the one she wrote on homelessness, &#8220;The Reclamation of Skid Row.&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;But not with the likes of people on this website. We need people like Pat Buchanan who will tell the truth using researched facts and not biased sterotypes [sic]&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do you post here?  You present NO researched facts of your own, just your own opinions, which you believe to be facts, yet you pontificate to us that we use &#8216;biased stereotypes&rsquo; even though many of us cite researchers such as Arthur Jensen and Professors Ruston and Lynn, who have each made it his life&rsquo;s work to research and explain black/white differences. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few researched-based facts you may not like:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Despite widespread claims that the gap is closing between Blacks and Whites in educational achievement and intelligence test scores, new research shows the 15-point IQ difference is as large today as it was 100 years ago. A study published in the October 2006 issue of Psychological Science showed the same Black-White IQ difference in large standardization samples for four major IQ tests&hellip;The Black-White gap was also shown in 2001 in an analysis of 6,246,729 individuals from military, corporate, and higher education samples&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>The black version of racial &#8220;dialogue&#8221; is what we can see and hear from the racist Dyson on the above referenced video by John P.M.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/29287466#29287466" rel="nofollow">https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/29287466#29287466</a></p>
<p>And what Holder has to say is a pitiful attempt at using feeble black psychology to goad people into feeling as if they should feel pressed to overlook the many negative black traits, inabilities, bad behavior, and lack of intelligence in order to try once again to mainstream blacks by accepting them now as they are.  </p>
<p>Miscreants like Holder I&rsquo;m pretty sure knows that blacks are not going to improve, so the next best thing he can do is to utilize what he believes is a clever ploy to goad whites down to the black level, just as blacks and radical leftists do in education, as a dumbing down process.  For years they&rsquo;ve failed at elevating blacks academically, so they finally had to dumb down the curriculum and tests to reduce the number of blacks who always fail.</p>
<p>The black psychology he is forced to employ is so silly it fools only the most gullible, but he believes it will work, because he&rsquo;s beset with the same problem most blacks have which is black arrogance.   What Holder has accomplished is just the opposite with whites, because it has angered them and made them remember all the reasons they have a great deal of legitimate aversion to blacks. These people are above the average and not easily taken in by some ignorant black flim flam wannabe. </p>
<p>Next on the Holder agenda in the near future?  </p>
<p>Reversal of the second amendment.  And, it will be done in increments, first compelling licensing of all weapons; then banning &#8220;assault&#8221; weapons, which could be anything; then complete confiscation, all over time, performed in varying degrees, using that same kind of brilliant psychological ploy he did in calling people cowards who won&rsquo;t discuss race. </p>
<p>The result?  My guess is that he&rsquo;s going to learn the hard way that most whites are not so stupid as to disarm themselves under the control of a black power structure, as in South Africa, and I can&rsquo;t go into detail as to why this won&rsquo;t happen, because it won&rsquo;t meet the guidelines for discussion here, but I can offer the below video as just one example most white people know full well that the second amendment doesn&rsquo;t have a damned thing to do with hunting, and aren&rsquo;t about to give up their weapons.</p>

			<p>To: Anonymous, Schoolteacher, ice, Risorgimento II, and everyone else who enjoyed that MSNBC link, I am glad to see that you saw the merit in my putting it up. </p>
<p>Your further insights through your comments, were all excellent and very thought provoking as well. To me that exchange between Mr. Buchanan and Comrade Dyson was so atypical of what &#8220;frank racial conversations&#8221; have devolved into in this country, that I just had to put it up; normally, it all boils down to a torrent of anti-white abuse and accusations by some grievance-terrorist &#8220;of color,&#8221; with some squirming white fool groveling and then apologizing for these hateful lies. Mr. Buchanan of course did not do this. He not only stood up to this anti-white propaganda blitz by Comrade Dyson, but also had the guts to reduce it to the absurdity that it is, and laugh at him while doing it.</p>
<p>That is the only way to handle the multicultural freaks and Red fools on the other side of this so-called debate; rip there maudlin platitudes to shreds and then jocundly mock them, when they degenerate into an inarticulate or even profane tirade of sanctimony. </p>
<p>All the best to you four good people and all,</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any white who grows up in a black neighborhood and likes it is one who likes getting his head beat on and harrassed and bullied to the nth degree, because that&rsquo;s EXACTLY what occurs to whites living in black neighborhoods.&#8221; -Posted by q</p>
<p>Well said Q! Since &#8220;Rational Thinker&#8221; first made his appearance not too long ago, I&rsquo;ve wondered where they got this mole! What other facts do we need aside from every criminal and standardized test statistic ever devised! Furthermore, we have our own two eyes to see that the experiment called Multiculturalism is an abject failure.</p>
<p>Much like most people here, I had the misfortune of growing up in an all black neighborhood in Washington DC. Being the token white is NOT the same as being the token black, and there was nothing more searing than having my childhood and adolescence stripped away from me because of two stupid liberals I had the misfortune of being born into! There are few more disheartening then when I would hear other whites preach the evils of racism, but the only time you saw them in my neighborhood was when they were either lost, or they were police officers. </p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;re here for a reason, and the reason is because this is where we can have a frank and open discussion about race. Most of you are like me which means you learned through bitter first hand experience. Yes, property values DO decline, schools DO worsen, crime DOES go up &hellip;</p>
<p>Even more importantly: during my 20 years around blacks, I knew maybe two dozen that were exceptional. Otherwise, I learned that no matter how nice his clothes, car, house, or job are, black is STILL black! </p>

			<p>Ajax, my father did not enlist in the Navy in 1941 in order to fight racism.  He enlisted because Japan attacked us.  When he returned to the US, his liberal bretheren turned on him and accused HIM of being a racist.  They took his schools and local government away from him and ridiculed him in print and film.  They said his ancestors were no good and that he was ignorant.  That was the thanks my father got for enlisting to fight in World War II.  He should have stayed home.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Dyson&hellip;Like ALL blacks I see on T.V. debating a point, he thinks the way to debate is to talk more and over the other person and whoever pushes the most words across his lips is the winner, like in a basketball or baseball game&hellip;.the impossibility in trying to get blacks to confront the race issue honestly&hellip;has, like all blacks, a problem with abstract thought. (Posted by ice at 9:25 AM on February 21)</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, but I think I disagree with your view that most whites will recognize all this when they see him on TV.</p>
<p>I think most of us have been so conditioned over the years to that form of black &#8220;debate&#8221; that we don&rsquo;t even notice it  &mdash;  most of us don&rsquo;t even notice that the black man is behaving differently from the white man!</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve been hanging around Amren for a few years now, I doubt I might have noticed it except that I&rsquo;ve been having a debate EXACTLY like that one with a black lady on knoxnews.com. I&rsquo;d been noticing all those elements in her, as I&rsquo;ve noticed them in other blacks I&rsquo;ve debated online, and then when I watched the marvelous Buchanan/Dyson &#8220;debate,&#8221; I saw clearly for the first time what I was looking at and hearing when these black leaders strut their stuff  &mdash;  the same thing I hear when debating almost ANY black  &mdash;  arrogant stupidity!</p>
<p>My own perceptions are possibly a little sluggish, but in my experience with whites, most of us don&rsquo;t see ANYthing! (But I&rsquo;ve lived in Berkeley, Ca. for 35 years). We become accustomed to black behavior and don&rsquo;t see it as exceptional.</p>
<p>But a smart liberal friend of mine has begun asking herself, &#8220;How would I feel if a WHITE person had behaved that way with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes are beginning to open.</p>

			<p>Any conversation about race between whites and blacks like this is automatically a win for the blacks. If you agree that white racism is at the root of blacks problems, then their worldview is validated. But if you openly dare to say that the root of blacks problems is their own destructive behavior, then they have also won  &mdash;  because you have just done them the favor of validating their white conspiracist fantasies. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s futile either way, especially when you consider that any conversation about race with blacks will always turn into a loud, vicious, head-bobbing shouting match  &mdash;  at best. At worst, you get physically attacked, and/or fired.<br>

			<p>Why are all of you disrespecting Attorney General Holder and Professor Dyson?  A fact that all of you need to very, very seriously consider is that these men represent the ELITE, the Best and the Brightest that Blacks can achieve in America.  Both Holder and Dyson are educated &hellip;what? J.D. and PhD?&hellip;. and despite what many of you think, no sorry, these aren&rsquo;t simply handed out if those pursuing them coincidentally happen to be BLACK, and for what it&rsquo;s worth, these men had to WORK to get where they are;  Holder as AG, and Dyson as Professor at Georgetown.  They are both fairly articulate, and these men are the Zenith of Achievement and Education for Black America.  And like the rest of you, I noticed, that if these men represent all of these things&hellip; that all too rare Black with an IQ in the triple digits, educated, articulate, professional&hellip; and both are obviously absolutely and totally clueless about the Racial Realism, but instead fall back on the now well worn-out cliche of simply &#8220;Blame Whitey!&#8221; then friends, if these men DO represent that zenith, that pinnacle, that paragon of excellence for Black America, then Black America is even more hopelessly doomed, doomed, doomed and lost than the worst of us could have ever imagined in our darkest hour.  If someone brings up reparations with either of these two, does any one of you honestly think for a second that these educated, articulate, professional individuals&hellip; along with what? &#8220;96%?&#8221; of the rest of Black America is not absolutely for it&hellip; YOUR Money&hellip; for basically what amounts to their own collective inability to function in any kind of civilized society?  Let&rsquo;s take the statistic that Pat Buchanan mentioned, are you willing to pay Reparations to accommodate&hellip;nay, even encourage!&hellip; a 70% illegitimacy rate in Black America?  Are you willing to pay Reparations to support and accommodate even more Black-on-White crime?  Sadly, however, when all is considered, I got to agree with Mr. Holder.  By and large, the vast, vast majority of White America collectively ARE absolutely cowards.  Sure, Pat Buchanan stood up and put himself on the firing line for White America again as he has so very many times before, but how many of the rest of us REALLY would do this aside from anonymous postings on websites such as this?  How many of us are willing to stand up in the workplace, NO MATTER THE CONSEQUENCES!!! and defend our race?  How many of us are willing to get up in front of the media, NO MATTER THE CONSEQUENCES, and talk about the things that apparently only Pat Buchanan and a select very few others (we all know who they are&hellip;) are willing to pay the price to do?  How many of us are willing to go to our child&rsquo;s school and demand to know why special allowances are made for the education of disruptive, IQ-challenged Black thugs at the expense of the White Students?  How many of us?</p>
<p>How many of us?</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; Mr. Holder was right.  We ARE Cowards!  As another man much, much wiser than myself once said, &hellip; &#8220;what presents itself as political wisdom today is actually a spirit of voluntary subjugation, of unprincipled renunciation of any resistance   &mdash;   yes, of the shameless persecution of those who dare to think of such resistance and whose work could clearly serve the renewal of their people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Criticism is easy.  Solutions more difficult.  The solution?  Until Absolute and Total Separation becomes a realistic option, then unfortunately, the only solution is as another man much wiser than myself once admonished our grandfathers two generations ago, &#8220;STAND UP AND FIGHT  &mdash;  WHITE MEN!&#8221;  Otherwise, we are ultimately just wasting our time&hellip; even being here and making these anonymous comments on this website.  Perhaps it is well past time for AR to truly move out of cyberspace and into the local communities.  Perhaps it is time for AR to become a true &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; on the streets of the cities and towns all across the nation.  Are you a member of your local chapter?  If no, then I am simply curious as to why you are not?</p>
<p>Is it because Holder is right?</p>
<p>If there is no local chapter of AR in your area, then why haven&rsquo;t you begun one yourself?</p>
<p>Is it because Holder is right?</p>
<p>Are you willing to do WHATEVER IS NECESSARY to save your people, save your country, somehow stop and then reverse what is very obviously the End of America?</p>
<p>If you are not, then yes, Holder is right, we are all Cowards.  Even those of us who might think of ourselves as &#8220;Racial Realists&#8221; here.  Are we here too nothing more than Internet Commandos&hellip; and nothing more?  </p>
<p>So I ask you again, is Holder right?<br>

			<p>As a holder of a Ph.D. myself, I can guarantee the anonymous poster above that 1)standards in graduate programs are indeed lowered for blacks and mestizos, both with regards to admissions and to the quality of work that is expected of them and that 2)Dyson did not have to &#8220;stuggle&#8221; for anything. His post at Georgetown is merely the latest in a string of prestigious jobs, and that sort of career trajectory  &mdash;  DePaul, UNC, Columbia, Brown  &mdash;  would be virtually impossible for any white scholar in the humanities. But because Holder is black, he moves easily from one of these jobs to the next. A quick look at his publications (he is supposed to be a scholar in theology) tells you all you need to know about him. Show me the white scholar who has built a career like Dyson&rsquo;s on the strength of &#8220;books&#8221; like &#8220;Holla if You Hear Me: In Search of Tupac Shakur&#8221; or &#8220;Why I Love Black Women.&#8221; If Dyson is the &#8220;best&#8221; black America has to offer, that fact is a serious indictment of black America and of the academy itself.</p>

			<p>Simply, the only way Whites will ever satisfy the racial animosity of Blacks is to become extinct.  Regardless, even if extinct, Blacks will spend the next hundred years in their declining, primative society continuing to blame Whitey.  With the election of Obama, it has become clear that Blacks are becoming MORE confrontational and demanding.  A Black commentator recently said, regarding the NY Post cartoon, that what newspapers need is more Blacks to watch for such &#8220;mistakes.&#8221;  What he is saying is that we need Blacks in the news to censor what Whites read or hear.</p>

			<p>Yes we are a nation of cowards and yes we do need to have a frank conversation about race&hellip; but not the type that Holder has in mind. Holder would have us talk about how guilty whites are for alleged racism against blacks and for alleged past mistreatment. </p>
<p>What we really need to talk about is white cowardice in the face of black racism against whites. Whites are walking on egg shells afraid to say even the slightest thing that might offend blacks. Whites even cover up and ignore the fact that blacks commit a hugely disproportionate amount of crime against whites, and have much lower IQs on average. Whites make all kinds of excuses in order to avoid holding Blacks accountable for their own behavior.</p>
<p>Whites are cowards because most of us are afraid to tell the truth about race and we allow foreigners who despise us to come here, and we give them money and pay for their anchor babies! Of course we are nation of cowards. Not only are we a nation of cowards, worse than that we are really a nation of ignoramuses about race! </p>
<p>Yes, a frank discussion about race is long overdue. Let&rsquo;s talk about the massive cost to our country and our security by allowing violent blacks and Mexicans to live among us. Expelling these violent hateful non-whites to other countries would be a good place to start! </p>
<p>Unfortunately I believe it will have to get much worse before whites are prepared to discuss real solutions to the race problem.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Eric Holder states: &ldquo;&hellip; the workplace is largely integrated, but Americans still self-segregate on the weekends and in their private lives.&rdquo; (self-segregate in private at home, as opposed to government forced integration at work) &#8220;</p>
<p>Oh, so now that we&rsquo;ve had 50 years of forced integration in schools and the workplace, that&rsquo;s still  not enough to satisfy mr. holder.   Now we have to get integrated even in our own homes and in our private lives!  </p>
<p>What kind of lunacy is this coming to?</p>

			<p>In that Hardcopy video I saw Pat Buchanan debating with one mulatto (Professor Dyson), about something another mulatto (Attorney General Holder) said whilst making reference to the grand mulatto (Hussein).<br>
US racial politics is a quagmire for whites, all you can do is withdraw with as much of your dignity intact as possible.</p>
<p>This talk of cowardice, looks like this Eric Holder is baiting whites to spend more time with blacks by calling you chicken &ldquo;cluck, cluck&rdquo;. Disturbing that this is one of the first statements comming from the highest ranking representative in US law enforcement and the first African American to hold the post.<br>
What, it&rsquo;s not enough to have the top posts in the country?<br>
Their 13% of ther population are <b>owed</b> at least the same amount of statistical representation throughout all administrative bodies based on skin color not merit, &#8220;but lets be post racial too&#8221;(lots of mixed messages).</p>
<p>The Government wants you working together with *Affirmative Action, living together with section eight housing (and a side affect of AA is economic equality) and they want you playing together over the weekends, leading to the eventual laying together (as miscegenation is their ultimate goal). </p>
<p>If you think about miscegenation from the Governments point of view, it solves a lot of problems for them.</p>
<p>In elevating the IQ of one group while lowering the IQ of another.</p>
<p>You make racial seperatism harder with numerous family trees being infiltrated, more and more capable mulattos running around representing blacks which make our racial arguements weaker.<br>
Plus they become easier on the eye like Tyra banks, Alicia Keyes, Holly Berry and so (not my cup of tea, but you get the point).<br>
Add to that you have created a large pool of tailor made democrat voters (to the already targeted felons, illegal&rsquo;s, the deceased and children). </p>
<p>People who post at Amren are not their ideal citizens at all, they want you citizens to be just smart enough to go to work and pay your taxes while not question anything.<br>
Big business is colorblind and cares nothing for our &lsquo;quaint notions&rsquo; of ethno-nationalism. <br>
In fact according to what I&rsquo;ve read on local immigration web sites, Countries like Australia and America holding onto our national identities actually slows down the assimulation process for immigrants because it makes the immigrants feel alien.<br>
Hence our white icons disappearing.</p>
<p>Our national identity (Australia) which was previousily marketed as being a colonial, tough, frontiers men and woman,<br>
fighting together at Gallipoli (WW1), getting the job done type of country. Has now been rebranded and as a land of immigrants who all come together from around the world to work together for the united goal, with our nightly news full of recent immigrants doing well type stories. <br>
And in the same newscast any 15 year old white kid who shows any ethno-nationalistic pride gets labelled as a Neo-nazi (though I doubt they even really know the difference between a national socialist nazi and a neo nazi).</p>
<p>And to be big business we&rsquo;re all just numbers not people, consumers.<br>
When they need a large group of trained, intelligent and cheap people for any new emerging specialized technology. India and China have proven themselves good at mobilizing it&rsquo;s main strength &#8216;people&rsquo;, look at how they&rsquo;ve dominated I.T. globally (apparently they&rsquo;re now focusing on biotech and medicine for their next boom).<br>
And from what I read about (Western) generation Y in the workforce, they are described as being talented and technological, but they expect instant financial and promotional recognition/gratification and they lack the patience to commit to a employer. So employers are holding on to the baby boomers to have some consistency, current economic situation willing.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
But back to the mulatto issue. In South Africa mulatto&rsquo;s are classified as the third category &#8216;colored&rsquo;.<br>
The way I thought about mulattos in the past was that they should go into the binary &#8216;black&rsquo; category as opposed to white as a sort of a punishment to their white parent for creating them.<br>
But with the way the tables have turned, their lost white genes are doing us nothing but harm while helping the other team.</p>
<p>In South Africa their Affirmative Action favors ethnic blacks first (I guess the rational is that they need&hellip;..maybe deserve it the most). <br>
A right wing solution to diffuse the mulatto power grab would be to concede on AA and offer more assistance, but with the qualifier that you have to quantify your DNA as being minimum 51% African ancestory. Because too much of our DNA is being used against us.</p>
<p><br>
If they can work out the genetic backgrounds of&hellip;.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/dexxwy" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/dexxwy</a><br>
Whoopi Goldberg   &mdash;   Sierra Leone, Liberia<br>
Taraji P. Henson - Cameroon Russ Parr - Niger<br>
Oprah Winfrey - Liberia</p>
<p>Surely they can quantify genetic percentages.<br>
But I do fear that by the time science gets to where it needs to be to help us, it will be too late for us if not already.</p>

_____________________________________</p>
<p>I think most of us are.  Not a shot fired and the conquest is virutally complete.   </p>
<p>As disgusted as I am by black pathology and illegal immigration, I am equally disgusted by liberaltard whites who were the brains behind the decimation of the U.S.  The rest of white America lacked the intestinal fortitude to stand up for what is right and stop this from happening.  Instead we allowed ourselves to be kowtowed into submission by federal judges, racist black opportunists, and the marxist U.S. dept of education. Our complacency was insured by a leftist media who quickly offered up such goodies as &#8220;monday night football&#8221;, &#8220;dancing with the stars&#8221; and all the other mind numbing tripe offered to us 24/7 via the boob tube. After all, who can be bothered with the destruction of one&rsquo;s country when American Idol is on?</p>
<p>Is is too late for us?  Are we cowards?  Probably, but I still hold out hope for the Pat Buchanans, Glenn Becks, Jared Taylors, Heather Macdonalds, Larry Elders and Thomas Sowells to fire up our communities at the local level.  </p>

			<p>A very unrealistic, utopian proposal.  First of all, which states would secede?  Many of the states in which the whites seem to be most disenfranchised from secular blue state America are also states that have large black populations   &mdash;   you&rsquo;re hardly going to get South Carolina to secede and become &#8220;all white.&#8221;  Secondly, why would one part of USA allow another part to secede?  How would it be in their interest?  </p>
<p>No, we need to stop dreaming about impossible fantasies.  We should concentrate on smaller but more realistic and more measurable goals: end immigration, end affirmative action, reduce white guilt, build white culture, find a way to get whites to stop splitting their votes so much and vote as a bloc instead, and most important, keep having babies.  </p>
<p>I think Jared has the right idea when he says he only recommends two goals: end immigration and repeal anti-discrimination laws.  Although I think I disagree with him on repealing anti-discrimination laws.  If we did repeal them, it is likely that whites would be discriminated against much more blatantly in institutions of higher education than they are now.  Better to try to stop reverse discrimination against whites.  </p>
