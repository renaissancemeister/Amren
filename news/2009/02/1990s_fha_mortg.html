<h1>1990s FHA Mortgage Default Rates by Ethnicity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Sailer, VDARE.com, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thanks to reader Tino, who found this [2] HUD document [see below], here are the mortgage default rates by ethnicity for three vintages of 1990s FHA-insured mortgages. The sample size is 240,901 loans.</p>
<p>The [3] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Housing_Administration" rel="external">Federal Housing Administration</a> insures smaller-sized mortgages of low and moderate income folks upon appraisal, so this is roughly an apples to apples comparison of fairly similar borrowers. In other words, we&rsquo;re not comparing rich whites to poor minorities, at least not as much as if we were looking at the population as a whole.</p>
<p>Moreover, the FHA seems to have been somewhat more responsibly managed than most other sectors of the mortgage industry. And this data is from the 1990s when housing was a more boring sector of the economy than in the 2000s.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re looking at representative, long term ethnic differences.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll recall, late 1992 was when the Boston Fed, under the leadership of [4] Richard Syron, published a warmly welcomed study claiming that mortgage lenders discriminated against minorities and should be loaning more to minorities. As Peter Brimelow asked in [5] <i>Forbes</i> at the time, doesn&rsquo;t that mean minorities should have <i>lower</i>default rates?</p>
<p>But nobody in politics cared, and the study helped Syron get the top job at Freddie Mac, where he earned $38 million while piloting Freddie onto the rocks.</p>
<p>Default rates for 1992 vintage FHA-insured mortgages after 7 years:<br>
White: 4.27%<br>
Black: 10.81%<br>
Hispanic: 13.18%</p>
<p>Default rates for 1992 vintage FHA-insured mortgages after 5 years:<br>
White: 4.10%<br>
Black: 9.14%<br>
Hispanic: 9.47%</p>
<p>Default rates for 1996 vintage FHA-insured mortgages after 3 years:<br>
White: 3.34%<br>
Black: 6.93%<br>
Hispanic: 6.99%</p>
<p>The source is<blockquote>[2] Analysis of FHA Single-Family Default and Loss Rates<br>
Prepared for:<br>
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development<br>
Office of Policy Development and Research<br>
Prepared by:<br>
Robert F. Cotterman<br>
Unicon Research Corporation<br>
March 2004<br>
</blockquote>Even when adjusted for FICO scores and other objective factors related to credit risk, minority default rates still look worse. Cotterman concludes:<blockquote>Blacks, Hispanics, and those in judicial foreclosure states and underserved areas have higher conditional loss rates, other things the same.<br>
</blockquote>So, the changes in policy and worldview that led to the gigantic increases in mortgage lending to minorities seen over the last decade (with total mortgage dollars written per year increasing [6] 691% for Hispanics and 397% for blacks from 1999 to the peak of the Housing Bubble in 2006) unsurprisingly led to world-historical levels of mortgage defaults in 2007&#150;2009. After all, blacks and Hispanics were still defaulting at very high levels when they weren&rsquo;t getting as much mortgage lending. The law of diminishing marginal returns suggests that throwing more mortgage money at them wasn&rsquo;t going to improve their credit worthiness.</p>
<p>In 2004&#150;2007, minorities received half of subprime mortgage dollars handed out. A [7] <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/01/we-finally-have-first-admittedly-small.html" rel="external">new 2008 Boston Fed study</a> shows minorities in Massachusetts getting foreclosed on subprime loans at twice the race of whites, suggesting that minorities accounted for a sizable majority of subprime dollars defaulted.</p>
<p>To the extent that we&rsquo;ve had a debate over minority mortgage lending policy in the 18 months since the cratering of the subprime market (which we&rsquo;ve barely had at all), it&rsquo;s been along the ideological lines of More Regulation vs. Less Regulation.</p>
<p>And yet, when we look at the federal policy over the last four Presidential terms, what we see is more aptly explained by a different paradigm than Regulation vs. Deregulation:</p>
<p><b>Who? Whom?</b></p>
<p>The Clinton Administration both strengthened some mortgage regulations and loosened others, all in the name of increasing minority homeownership. In complete contrast, The Bush Administration loosened some regulations and strengthened others, all with the intention of closing the racial homeownership gap.</p>
<p>The results of all this &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; social engineering was to first make housing unaffordable, and then, when the world finally woke up to the fact that it wouldn&rsquo;t be getting paid back on its mortgage lending, to smash the global economy.</p>

			<p>So we find out that there are racial differences in default rates, even adjusting for credit scores.  Should this mean that lenders should use race as a factor?  They should, but the world will fall on their shoulders if they try.</p>

			<p>The su-prime crash was the first domino to fall and took the others with it world wide.</p>
<p>Both globalism and catering to diversity were the main causes for what amounted to a near total collapse of nations worldwide, but don&rsquo;t hold your breath.  It isn&rsquo;t over yet, not by a long shot.  In fact we&rsquo;re just beginning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots more to come which is even worse than what we&rsquo;ve had so far, so it could well be that diversity will not only prove that it&rsquo;s dangerous, it will prove it is ultra lethal as well.</p>
<p>So, in the final analysis, it probably can be accurately stated that diversity destroyed the world as we know it.</p>

			<p>This comes as no shock at all. It has long been established that the cause of the sub-prime melt-down was the insistence by Liberals that banks give mortgages to minorities who were too poor to afford them. Shame on the Liberals, of course, but shame on &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; in Congress too for allowing them to do it.</p>

<p>Are you serious, where have been for the past 4 months. Do you read the papers or watch the news. The banks mishanled the money plain and simple. Do realize that they tried to buy extravagant unneccassary stuff. Such as airplanes, giving themselves bonuses, going on expense vactions, expensive trash cans, and remodling their offices with expensive furniture all with your tax dollars.</p>
<p>These white men testified Feb 11 and couldnt give on viable answer to anything that was asked. They only pleaded the fifth. They are mishandling the money right now as we speak and you want to talk bad about minorities. You are a hypocrite. If these men were black the readers would go crazy about how bad blacks are for the world and how inferior they are. Then talk about the double standards in the media.</p>
<p>THAT IS THE TYPE OF CHESS POUNDING RHEOTRIC CONSERVATIVES DONT WANT TO HEAR. ITS ALREADY BAD ENOUGH TO EXPRESS OUR IDEAS IN PRIVATE.</p>

			<p>The truth where I live at least, is that anyone who was paying attention understood that all of the Mexicans moving into neighborhoods, by the  millions in Southern California,  were illegal aliens and could not afford the mortagages that were given to them. How could adults that worked minimum wage jobs in many cases, who had 3 or 4 kids, sometimes more, afford the mortagage on a 2 story house? The answer was that they couldn&rsquo;t,and now the Obama adminstration is planning to keep many in those houses by mortagaging the future of American youths, who will have to pay for this of the Democrats many years down the road.</p>

			<p>Excuse me? This problem was caused by the government forcing banks to make bad loans not by banks buying airplanes. If the banks were making only good loans, they could afford the airplane. In fact, the airplane seems like a good investment when compared to the prospect of that or throwing the money down a rat hole. At least the airplane money could be recovered by selling the plane, which is only partially true with these mortgage loans. At least the bankers won&rsquo;t trash the airplane when they have to sell it, like the mortgage non payer does when he gets foreclosed opon. This is nothing more than a red herring thrown in to deflect criticism of the true cause of the problem.</p>

			<p>rational thinker, you are proving beyond doubt that you cannot think, rationally or otherwise. Please read the article for solid evidence that mortgage default rates are 3 times higher for blacks than whites. These statistics come from the government, not the banks. </p>
<p>You are confusing several stories about bankers, by the way. In one case, it turned out the funds used for the office remodel were personal funds, in others there is some culpability, but let me explain the banking business to you in very simple terms. Banks loan money at interest to people or institutions that are likely to repay. There are objective measures to determine the likelihood of repayment, they are race-blind and usually numerical. Blacks and other minorities started agitating to force the banks to lend to them regardless of risk, and in the 1990&rsquo;s, they found a friend in the Clinton Whitehouse. Clinton gave the banks a choice, lend to uncreditworthy minorities, or lose your business license. Well, the piper has to be paid sometime, and since minorites default at a rate 3 times that of White borrowers, we now have a banking crisis which is destroying the world financial markets. </p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics will not pay unless there is the threat of a big man or jefe throwing them out (like a landlord). Once a minority moves into a home, they simply believe they own it by divine right and do not have to pay the mortgage to the bank. As usual, Whites will now pick up the tab for black and brown irresponsibility, and since the &#8220;Big Man&#8221; is the President, we will see blacks default at record rates because they believe their &#8220;Chief&#8221; will provide for them. Blacks are proving they cannot live in a Liberal, Western Democratic society. Our entire way of life depends on everyone working to take care of themselves and their own and meeting their financial obligations. We now have 100 million who refuse to do any such thing, they are dead weight. This financial crisis is just the first bill we are getting for allowing their reprehensible behavior.</p>

			<p>&#8220;rational thinker&#8221; strikes again. With his pointing to high salaries, unnecessary purchases like executive jets, and other fiscal irresponsibilities by the upper management echelon&hellip; while overlooking the obvious:</p>
<p>That QUESTIONABLE LOANS (TO BLACKS, TO HISPANICS) INVARIABLY LED TO DEFAULT! That enough defaults by Blacks, by Hispanics, had a way of adding up&hellip; when you consider the MILLIONS of questionable mortgages, the millions of credit cards issued, NEITHER LOAN TYPES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO BLACKS OR HISPANICES&hellip; UNLESS the wage earning ability and repayment history of individuals of either race amply justified the making of such loans beyond reasonable doubt!</p>
<p>I am hardly excusing the fiscal irresponsibility of the banking CEOs, but the simple reality is, there was NO JUSTIFIABLE REASON, other than liberal stupidity, pandering by politicians for purpose of buying future votes from these two minorities.</p>
<p>That the lending institutions also made questionable loans to White buyers is also inarguable. Nor any less justified than the liberal nonsense that even &#8220;illegals deserve a piece of the American dream.&#8221; The losses incurred due to bad lending practices (multiple-millions of bad mortgages) far outweigh the losses caused by that nonsense bleated by &#8220;rational thinker&#8221; in his current irrational diatribe.</p>
<p>NO ONE deserves a mortgage simply for belonging to a racial minority group. Unless, of course, that person is a legitimate U.S. resident, has a good credit history and that person&rsquo;s earnings capability justifies making such a mortgage loan. The damned liberal fools, the traitorous, pandering politicians ultimately deserve the blame for the current financial debacle bad mortgage loans caused!</p>

Santa Teresa High School is a den of thieves, waiting for unwarry victims to rob. I see them walking by my street every day, smoking pot, glarring at me like I do not belong in my own home. I&rsquo;m sick of it. These so-called students are nothing more than X-paroles or worse, with nothing better to do but capitalize on the innocent.  I wish I stayed in New Hampshire. Mexifornia is that, a den of thieves, built by liberal elitist who, in their &#8220;Gated Communities&#8221;, decide for us. Put Pelosi, Obama &amp; his kids in L.A. public schools and their gripes will seem comical. Hypocrites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Are you serious, where have been for the past 4 months. Do you read the papers or watch the news. The banks mishanled the money plain and simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sub-prime crash started this falling domino around the entire globe, because Clinton, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Maxine Waters and other pro-black and Hispanic misfits forced the banks to reduce their requirements for loan qualification.</p>
<p>It is non-whites who are responsible for bringing the world to ruin, and there&rsquo;s too many people who have written of it to try to claim otherwise.</p>
<p>It will be in the history books as the &#8220;diversity crash.&#8221;  Non-whites have not only brought our country to ruin, they are responsible for collapsing economies all around the world.</p>
<p>Yes, the banksters cheated and are rats themselves, but if it weren&rsquo;t for being forced to give loans to people who couldn&rsquo;t pay for them, the cheating and gouging would never have had an opportunity to begin.</p>
<p>Giving you people freebies has brought on this entire situation, and how apropos, because it was the rainbow crowd who is behind pushing for those who couldn&rsquo;t pay their mortgages.</p>
<p>You admonished another poster on being wrong, when you&rsquo;re so badly misinformed, my friend, with each post you reveal an inability to think rationally, coherently, and, most of all, logically. But your big problem here is that you don&rsquo;t understand the problem at all.<br>

			<p>If you recall, the statement from the press was always that minorities were being unfairly kept from loans because they were being held to higher standards.  If that were true, the minorities would show a lower default rate since the minorities receiving the loans were more creditworthy than a comparable white.  If fact, their default rate was higher, which proves they were receiving preferential treatment, and it was whites who were held to the higher standard.<br>
