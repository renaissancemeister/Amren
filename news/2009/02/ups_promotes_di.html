	<p>Press Release<br>
UPS<br>
Natalie Sinclair, 404-828-4250<br>

<p>UPS (NYSE: UPS) is helping five minority students learn what it takes to work &#8220;under the hood&#8221; by awarding $15,000 scholarships to attend the NASCAR Technical Institute in Mooresville, N.C.</p>
<p>Since 2002, The UPS Racing Technical Edge Scholarship has awarded a total of $525,000 in scholarships to 35 minority students seeking careers in the automotive or motorsports industries who demonstrate strong academic performance, leadership and community involvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;UPS&rsquo;s commitment to diversity extends to everything we do, including our involvement in motorsports,&#8221; said Ron Rogowski, UPS director of sponsorships and events. &#8220;We&rsquo;re proud to support the passion and career goals of these talented individuals while helping NASCAR develop a more diverse workforce and fan base.&#8221;</p>
<p>NASCAR Tech combines an automotive technology curriculum with NASCAR-specific courses. Its hands-on learning environment equips students with the knowledge and experience to become leaders in the field.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s recipients of the UPS Racing Technical Edge Scholarship include:</p>
<p>Raphael Diaz, Durham, N.C.</p>
<p>Raphael Diaz started working in his uncle&rsquo;s auto shop when he was a teenager. He hopes to continue learning about every aspect of the automotive engineering field, from designing body styles to building engines. His professional goal is to be part of a racing team, like his role model and Sprint Car Series driver Juan Pablo Montoya, the first Latino driver in NASCAR.</p>
<p>Evrin Fletcher, Concord, N.C.</p>
<p>Evrin Fletcher has been around racing most of his life. His uncle introduced him to the sport as a kid and he has been fascinated by cars ever since. Fletcher worked as a certified mechanic for five years before coming to NASCAR Tech to pursue his dream of working with a professional racing team.</p>
<p>Mohammad Jawad, Elmont, N.Y.</p>
<p>Since he was a child, Mohammad Jawad has been enthralled with taking things apart and putting them back together. After his graduation from NASCAR Tech in December, he hopes to pursue a career in NASCAR so he can work with some of the most technologically advanced vehicles in the world.</p>
<p>Andre Perry, Mooresville, N.C.</p>
<p>Andre Perry learned quickly what it takes to be an auto technician. After graduating from high school, his father gave him his first car and told him that he had to learn how to keep it running. Since enrolling at NASCAR Tech, Perry&rsquo;s passion for cars has only increased and he&rsquo;s now a leader in the NASCAR Tech community. Perry&rsquo;s future plans include working with alternative fuel vehicles.</p>
<p>Joshua Weston, Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>An exceptional student, Joshua Weston has received various academic honors at NASCAR Tech. But his passion for cars extends beyond the classroom. Weston&rsquo;s favorite ride on the road is anything Audi and he hopes to eventually work for an Audi dealership as a Master Certified Technician.</p>
<p>NASCAR Technical Institute, a division of Universal Technical Institute, Inc. (NYSE: UTI), has an exclusive educational alliance with NASCAR. Located in Mooresville, N.C., NASCAR Tech is the only school of its kind that combines automotive training and a NASCAR-approved technologies curriculum into one program. For more information, visit www.uti.edu.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Atlanta, Ga., UPS (NYSE: UPS) is the world&rsquo;s largest package delivery company and a global leader in supply chain services. Each day, the UPS pit crew of more than 425,000 dedicated employees delivers to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. In 2009, UPS begins its 10th year as the Official Delivery Company of NASCAR and its ninth consecutive year of primary sponsorship in the league&rsquo;s top-ranked Sprint Cup Series.

			<p>UPS is a company very deserving of a boycott. Do not ship anything via UPS and do not have something shipped to you via UPS. Everyone focus on *NOT* engaging in any form of commerce with UPS, even if it costs you a few dollars more.</p>
<p>Never buy anything from Tyson Foods either.</p>

If these five have what it takes to make the cut and can prove themselves in the heat of battle, fine.</p>
<p>This is an issue where the rubber meets the road. With thousands of dollars and lives at stake, these guys aren&rsquo;t going to get an affirmative action pass.</p>

			<p>Wait until UPS announces major layoffs, as shipping will undoubtedly be negatively impacted by an ever more strained global economic situation. They squander money on feel-good nonsense like this at a time when many businesses are facing bankruptcy or already closing the doors. What crazy times we live in!</p>

			<p>If you go to the UPS website, you&rsquo;ll see that they brag about their work force being 40% minority.  Since thast&rsquo;s way over minority representation in the population it&rsquo;s a disgraceful admnission to make.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping we can do what is necessary to see that UPS suffers maximum business loss during this depression, with the hope that the company will fold altogether.</p>
<p>UPS is one of the corporate enemies of all whites everywhere and should be boycotted, using another service with the exception of FEDX which is every bit as bad as UPS.</p>
<p>They both need to go.  They&rsquo;ve outlived their usefulness to this society.  Maybe NASCAR attendees can help by boycotting events where UPS minorities are awarded freebies that whites have to work for.</p>

			<p>I hate to say it but us whites are to blame.  How many of us speak out against diversity?  It&rsquo;s certainly not the majority.  How many of these companies even hear from us?  All they see in the Board Room is whites stepping aside for the next majority to take control.  They still get out dollars and our loyalty.</p>

			<p>Almost all UPS drivers in my area are black or mexican. Even the mailmen are. IMO, they were all affirmative action hires, period. John Jay was right! Too bad we do not have a POTUS such as John Jay. He knew why and for whom this country was founded. </p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be one of the White NASCAR drivers, driving at 200 mph with no room for error, who has had my car serviced by one of those UPS affirmative action black mechanics.  If you&rsquo;ve ever seen the safety record of African airlines, you&rsquo;ll know what I mean.</p>

			<p>NASCAR just settled out of court..for millions no doubt&hellip;with a black female who sued because of, what else?  Racism!  Putting minorities in NASCAR is a recipe for disaster and I will bet you a dollar that one of these 5 comes out complaining that they were subjected to racism.</p>
<p>NASCAR sold its soul years ago and is nothing but wrestling on wheels now.  The France family cares only about money and desperately wants blacks involved.  For what, I have no idea.  Blacks will never embrace Nascar.  Whites are becoming disinterested in droves!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Since he was a child, Mohammad Jawad has been enthralled with taking things apart and putting them back together.&#8221;  You mean, like explosive devices (IED&rsquo;s)?</p>
<p>&#8220;Perry&rsquo;s future plans include working with alternative fuel vehicles.&#8221;  Gotta give the kid credit on this one.  He is smart enough to realize the feds will be dishing out mucho subsidies for the farce of developing so-called alternative fuels, thus keeping the public chasing their tails, and away from any viable development of efficient alternatives to oil.<br>

			<p>This is simply another nail in the coffin of NASCAR as a sport for Southerners. Long ago, NASCAR decided to sell out its fanbase and its traditional supporters in the name of multiculturalism and in the pursuit of cash. Races in Southern cities were shut down and replaced by ones in the West and North&hellip; this is when I stopped watching. I hope that more and more people heed that advice; NASCAR is no longer worthy of our entertainment dollar. </p>

			<p>I have always despised UPS&hellip;now even more so.<br>
Not only have they lost many of my packages, but their hiring practices and pay are as a result of stupid, gullible ignoramus mexicans who will stay out there delivering until 9 pm just because someone told them that this is a great company to work for.<br>
As a result the wages are driven way down. Didn&rsquo;t used to be low wages.<br>
In fact most delivery /service positions in so.cal are young hispanics who put in long days for a pittance.Fools!<br>

I wonder if that 40% is on a world-wide basis. I don&rsquo;t see how their workforce could be comprised of 40% minorities in just the United States alone.<br>

</i><br>
<p><br>
Agreed. But it isn&rsquo;t just anti European-American policies it is also their support for radical feminism (lesbianism) and homosexualtiy, and other far left programs (e.g. globalism).<br>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t see how both UPS and FedEx both survive this depression.  &hellip; real economic numbers point this out.  &#8220;Real&#8221; unemployment is between 13% and 17%.</p>
<p>I mean with global trade collapsing who needs overnight shipping?  </p>

			<p>It would only make sense to do this because its nothing more than a buissness ploy, thats all. This company is hurting and by having a few people of color could drag in more people of color to watch it and increase their revenue.</p>
<p>This is an issue hardly worth ranting and critizing. But I think the Arizona man who was arrest and charge for protecting his property from illegals is more important. He is now being sued by illegal mexican aliens.</p>

			<p>I personally Do Not Watch major sports events since I have very little interest in what blacks can do. If someone else wants to watch I am fine with that I have no interest in telling you how to live or enjoy Your Life. BUT if TURNABOUT is Fair Play and since whites make up the major portion of our population I wonder why they are not equally represented on say a Basketball Team where 13.5% of the population make up 90% of the players? The reason in many cases is they MIGHT not be as skillful BUT in the world of the black this should not matter it is Not Diversity In Action and maybe the white boys were denied the opportunity to practice all night because the had to WORK the next day? So for Diversities Sake and Non Discrimination the law according to THEIR thinking should force teams to use 75% white players? I say IF blacks are interested in INVADING auto racing let them do it on their own not some phony Diversity System? </p>

			<p>James:</p>
<p>Not only do I agree with you, but I can give you an example to show how bad it is, and something that can be easily remediated:</p>
<p>Back when I was living in St. Louis, I occasionally watched the prep sports highlights (mainly football and basketball) on the local news.  Because St. Louis is a big metropolitan area, there are way too many irons in the fire (sports and otherwise) to focus too much on high school games, so they&rsquo;re relegated mostly to weekend newscasts, and only for a few minutes.  (In contrast, they&rsquo;re covered far more in the Cape Girardeau-Carbondale-Paducah market in which I now live, as SEMO, SIUC, Murray State and the junior colleges are at the top of the heap).  What gets me is that there are several school in suburban St. Louis that are mostly white and rich in terms of population, but the libs who run their school boards just love their deseg.  So they bus in blacks from the city, and, what a surprise, they wind up predominating the football team and taking up almost all spots on the basketball team.  Here you go, the rich white parents and communities pay all these taxes for these pretty good schools and facilities, and especially with basketball, their kids are shut out of hoops.</p>
<p>If anyone thinks that some of this deseg isn&rsquo;t illegal athletic recruiting, they they&rsquo;re naive.</p>

			<p>If UPS&rsquo;s work force is 40% minority in a country that is approximately 30% minority, UPS has obviously been discriminating against whites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but it means they also clearly do not need white customers.</p>

<p>Blacks practice more than most groups, plain and simple. When I went to high school blacks would be on the courts almost all the time no matter what. They would also spend at least 4hrs a day  in the school GYM lefting weights. </p>
<p>If jews read more than blacks do then who do you think would dominate in reading scores and competitions jews or blacks?</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>

<p>Jews are on average significantly more intelligent than blacks, a brute fact which reading (or &#8220;practice&#8221;) will not change. Blacks do not and will not dominate anything requiring abstract intelligence.</p>

We will also have aa doctors, pilots, nuclear physicists, miners etc.<br>
I use these examples for only difficult or dangerous occupations as we already have an aa president, general (colin powel), police and teachers.<br>
When will Americans wake up? <br>
The average nascar fan would not approve of this. Most are conservative. I don&rsquo;t think the drivers will want these aa simpletons under the hoods of their cars either. What a waste.<br>

i wish they wwould make it a law that any company that brags about the percentage of minorities, would have to get that percentage up to say 80 to 90 percent. ups overnite? hell you wouldn&rsquo;t even know where your package is, let alone getting it delivered. let them kill themselve with diversity, meamwhile it will be an opportunity for a white delivery service to knock their socks off, and put them out of business. another entity ruined.</p>

			<p>Nobody in my family both immediate &amp; extended will buy a Tyson product. This is because of their operation in Noel, Mo. which attracts, hires &amp; succors many hispanics. They have replaced the jobs once held by locals because they work for less than the locals did.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Blacks practice more than most groups, plain and simple. When I went to high school blacks would be on the courts almost all the time no matter what. They would also spend at least 4hrs a day in the school GYM lefting weights. </p>
<p>If jews read more than blacks do then who do you think would dominate in reading scores and competitions jews or blacks?</p>
<p>I rest my case.&#8221;<br>
- rational thinker</p>
<p>No. Blacks do better in sports because they are better athletes. Whites and Jews in particular do better in reading because they are more intelligent.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>
