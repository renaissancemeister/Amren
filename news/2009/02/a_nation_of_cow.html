<h1>A Nation of Cowards</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter E. Williams, Creators Syndicate, February 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder said the United States is &#8220;a nation of cowards&#8221; when it comes to race relations. In one sense, he is absolutely right. Many whites, from university administrators and professors, schoolteachers to employers and public officials accept behavior from black people that they wouldn&rsquo;t begin to accept from whites. For example, some of the nation&rsquo;s most elite universities, such as Vanderbilt, Stanford University and the University of California, have yielded to black student demands for separate graduation ceremonies and separate &#8220;celebratory events.&#8221; Universities such as Stanford, Cornell, MIT, and Cal Berkeley have, or have had, segregated dorms. If white students demanded whites-only graduation ceremonies or whites-only dorms, administrators would have labeled their demands as intolerable racism. When black students demand the same thing, these administrators cowardly capitulate. Calling these university administrators cowards is the most flattering characterization of their behavior. They might actually be stupid enough to believe nonsense taught by their some of sociology and psychology professors that blacks can&rsquo;t be racists because they don&rsquo;t have power.</p>
<p>What about Holder&rsquo;s statement that America is &#8220;voluntarily segregated&#8221;? I say, so what. According to the census, in 2007, 4.6 percent of married blacks were married to a white; less than 1 percent of married whites were married to a black. While blacks are 13 percent of the population, they are 80 percent of professional basketball players and 65 percent of professional football players. Mere casual observance of audiences at ice hockey games or opera performances would reveal gross voluntary segregation. What would Holder propose the U.S. Justice Department do about these and other instances of voluntary segregation?</p>
<p>{snip} Just because some activity is not racially integrated does not mean that it is racially segregated.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the civil rights struggle is over and it is won. {snip} That does not mean that there are not major problems that confront a large segment of the black community, but they are not civil rights problems nor can they be solved through a &#8220;conversation on race.&#8221; {snip} Such pathology, I think much of it precipitated by family breakdown, is entirely new among blacks. In 1940, black illegitimacy was 19 percent; in 1950, only 18 percent of black households were female-headed compared with today&rsquo;s 70 percent. Both during slavery and as late as 1920, a teenage girl raising a child without a man present was rare among blacks.</p>
<p>If black people continue to accept the corrupt blame game agenda of liberal whites, black politicians and assorted hustlers, as opposed to accepting personal responsibility, the future for many black Americans will remain bleak.</p>

			<p>The cowardice here is not in whites demanding to dismantle black-only enclaves and institutions, Dr. Williams.  It&rsquo;s that whites are too scared to demand these things for themselves.  Frankly, a white doing the former is a far easier row to hoe than doing the latter, in this PC world.</p>

			<p> Of course Mr. Williams makes some very valid points. The separate graduation ceremonies and like events for blacks at majority-White colleges came about because college administrators as a group are spineless; they fear both being labeled &#8220;racists,&#8221; and physical intimidation by blacks, if they refuse.</p>
<p> The part about professional sports, or certain ones, anyway, being totally dominated by blacks, I have been bringing up for years. If you told many young people nowadays that the NBA was once heavily White, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t believe you. But it was. Ditto the NFL. There are many, many black athletes being paid salaries that would make a typical CEO look poverty stricken. But you never hear about that when Jesse, Al and their ilk begin the &#8220;we been victims of discrimination and White racism&#8221; song and dance.</p>

			<p>Excellent points by Walter Williams, one of the few blacks I respect.</p>
<p>But I think his entire piece is a moot point.  We&rsquo;re heading down, down down, and it won&rsquo;t matter in a little while what the policies are, because the elites are going to be fighting for bare survival.</p>
<p>Hallelejah.  It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t speak for anyone here, nor have they asked me to. So, speaking for myself, I personally could careless if their future is bleak. And if it happens, and I certainly have no reason to doubt it, they only have it coming to them. It would be impossible to imagine a more ignoble and cowardly life than crying for what you refuse to earn on your own merit. And to justify this based on an extremely one-sided view of history, one that paints another race with an extraordinarly broad brush and distorts all of the complexities of life reducing it to something more akin to a Saturday morning cartoon, only considerably less intelligent. <br>
Actually, it is possible to live a lesser life. The only thing more cowardly and ignoble than being a complete dependent is being a dedicated enabler. But isn&rsquo;t funny? Holder himself is the result of such enabling, and look at the thanks they get! Ya gotta laugh. There is some bizarre sort of justice to the whole thing. And Holder certainly has a point, though he thought he was talking about something else.<br>

			<p>As an aside, I&rsquo;m always puzzled to see so many whites following basketball and football. The professional teams are almost all black and when the players are interviewed they are literally straight from the ghetto. When I was a child, sports players were role models similar to people in my community.</p>

<p>Wow this sentence just says it all. It really shows the lack of knowledge whites have of blacks. When blacks protest in the streets about rap music or any other problem that they face (at the hands of their own) it gets no attention at all. But when they protest something similar to the recent monkey picture in the NEW YORK papers it gets all the attention in the world. </p>
<p>If blacks attempt to make in roads or improve it never gets any attention. This just shows AMERICAS obession with focusing on black failure. Even if they attempt to make changes. Ive seen many give up gang life complete high school with honors, just in time to go to college and make something of themselves. Now all they have to do teach their fellow brethern to do the same. Remember all stories are different so lumping blacks into a group would be wrong.</p>

Posted by elitist at 5:33 PM on February 25 </p>
<p>The word RACIST (in todays world) means ANYTHING said in a negative way regarding a non white is RACIST, no matter how true or verifiable. Until we come to our senses and understand the word has been hijacked and distorted in meaning these black thugs will continue to beat us with it, like a brick in the hand of a rioter. When someone calls you a RACIST, say I think you meant Racial-ist, someone who recognizes and spreaks of differences that are plainly seen. That is a big difference than hating as they say, someone strictly because of their race. I feel few people in America feel that way, it&rsquo;s behaviors not people they are against.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better thing for White students than to have separate dorms. It&rsquo;s too bad that they can&rsquo;t be miles apart as well. The number of rapes and other assaults should decrease drastically. Who in their right mind would want to associate with those people and to have to abide their pathologies?</p>

			<p>I know this is true from even as far back as 50 years ago.  My Father in-law worked for Pacific Power and Light (PP&L;) as a Lineman for 35 years. He said PP&L; was forced, through Affirmative Action, to hire a black man who worked with my in-law. The black man was lazy, but was at least easy to get along with, so he kept his job.</p>
<p>This black man went on vacation for one week and was due back on a Monday. On the day he was to return to work, he called his boss from 2000 miles away to demand another week of vacation, which was granted. My Father in-law and the other crew members found out about this and went to the boss in protest.  They told him that anyone else who would do this would be fired on the spot, so why does the black man get away with it?  The boss point blank told them that this black man, if fired, would need to be replaced by another black man due to Affirmative Action policies which were dictated to PP&L; by our government.  Since this was the 3rd black man hired to replace the others who did not work out, the boss decided to keep him since he was by FAR the best one of all the others, even though he was lazy and was frequently late for work, at least he wasn&rsquo;t arrogant and was easy to get along with. </p>
<p>The fact is, the White race has been forced to accept, not only the descendants of the black slaves, but also 100 million more minorities who have immigrated and had children in the past 50 years.  We were never cowards in the past, but 50 years of forced integration, along with threats of job loss and violence by the minorities while enforced by the government, we have been conditioned to accept anything the government forces upon us until we can no longer flee.  Our country has reached a boiling point that will end in massive civil unrest as the White man can no longer feed his family or protect them from the violence.  </p>
<p>We are now entering the most precarious times in the history of the United States, and we will witness unbelievable changes in our country in the next couple years that will horrify even the most hardened realists of our kind. <br>

			<p>Native Born White Americans have internalized their oppression. Get over your Christian guilt trip.  Be a complete rejectionist to the program of race replacement. If Native Born White Americans become an ever dwindling racial minority within the border of America&hellip;expect the&hellip;enslavement and extermination. Non-whites will have the numbers and power to do it.</p>
<p>White Males, get over your emascualtion. Stay the hell out of  football stadiums and basketball arenas. Real White Men do not sit in football stadiums watching young black multimillionaires named Anquan,Kareem and Tyrell in tight spandex chasing a piece of dead pig skin. Think of the message you are sending to your wives and daughters. </p>

<p>Yes, I agree. The most important fight we have now is to beat back the proposed Federal Hate Crimes/Thought crimes bill - which will implement EU/Canadian style restrictions on the rights of Whites to say or think anything critical of NW, Muslims, Third Word Immigrants, Gays &amp; lesbians anyone PC protected or just the political/media elites.</p>
<p>Get active locally and try to use the same successful techniques we used to beat back the last mass illegal alien amnesty.</p>

<p>There have been thousands of comments on hundreds of blogs, already, over comrade Holder&rsquo;s comments, that everyone knows are directed against white folks. Why is this stuff a surprise. Why? Afterall, European Americans have been leaving themselves open to this kind of abuse started by the leftists many years ago. Since then, the instigation against European Americans has only increased, become bolder, and will not stop, unless European Americans defend themselves against it. What is the best defense? Easy. European Americans have to act the same as the protected classes and band together to defend themselves and look after their own interests. There is no other way. In America today, only those people who are organized to act together have any power. The left has made it that way. The concept of individuals determining their own destiny has been a pipe dream for the last 150 years and will not return. Not in the U.S. anyway.</p>

<p>Lumping blacks into a group can&rsquo;t be avoided, because by and large they are the worst group of people in the US.  They cause so much trouble, violence, crime, and they haven&rsquo;t accomplished a single noteworthy thing to help the country out as a whole. They&rsquo;re our worst imaginable group to content with.  I imagine you are familiar with Miami.  </p>
<p>Now, if one in a great while does something positive.  Fine.  Good for him/her.  But it doesn&rsquo;t change a thing in evaluating the group as a whole. A few black exceptions aren&rsquo;t going to make a bit of difference to the vast majority who are rife with pathologies.</p>

			<p>To Jupiter:</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. Everything you said was exactly on point. </p>
<p>I was born and raised in Baltimore City, Maryland. Johnny Unitas and Brooks Robinson were the sports heroes when I was very young. </p>
<p>Looking back, I realize they embodied both athletic prowess and good character - you couldn&rsquo;t imagine either of them being involved in a shooting at a ghetto nightclub, or fighting dogs, or dealing drugs, or convicted of murder, or whatever other social atrocities that people have come to expect from modern black athletes. </p>
<p>However, to add to your post, I reluctantly say that the average white man must also reacquire his own masculinity, and by doing so, refuse to allow blacks to determine what&rsquo;s acceptable behavior. </p>
<p>Blacks today know that the average white man will back down in the face of their obnoxious bluster. Blacks have mastered the raised voice and dirty look, and they use them with great success against most white people. </p>
<p>White people must also learn to stand up for one another. In my job I often deal with white crime victims who were assaulted by blacks&hellip;in the presence of several other white people who stood idly by, or simply ignored the violence taking place. </p>
<p>I could go on and on. I hate to see anyone get something they don&rsquo;t deserve, and I personally feel that blacks enjoy a level of &#8220;bullying&#8221; against whites that they can&rsquo;t back up. </p>
<p>All of us need to reach down, find our personal strength, and stand up to them. </p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t agree with you. Does America have an obsession with white success? I think not. </p>
<p>Other than the crime report that is normally buried on the back of many papers most &#8220;human interest&#8221; stories about blacks focus on black achievement or celebrate black cultural or athletic contributions. Just last night I saw a news report on a young black man who was shot in McDonalds trying to save a women from a savage beating by another black. Why didn&rsquo;t the story focus on the black perpetrator, or violent crime and spouse abuse in the black community? Instead, it focused on the heroic young black man.  In this case, I believe rightly so.<br>

<p><i><b>&ldquo;If black people continue to accept the corrupt blame game agenda of liberal whites, black politicians and assorted hustlers, as opposed to accepting personal responsibility, the future for many black Americans will remain bleak.&rdquo;</b></i></p>
<p>Wow this sentence just says it all. It really shows the lack of knowledge whites have of blacks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you are aware of this, but the writer of this piece is a black man.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;When blacks protest in the streets about rap music or any other problem that they face (at the hands of their own) it gets no attention at all.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it doesn&rsquo;t happen with any real frequency or with any significant support from the black population. I&rsquo;ve been to black neighborhoods in nearly every major city in America, as well as quite a few you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of, and the &#8220;problems they face at the hands of their own,&#8221; are nearly uniform. If there was some significant resistance to these things, in any portion of the black population, this would not be the case. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;But when they protest something similar to the recent monkey picture in the NEW YORK papers it gets all the attention in the world.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a hell of a lot more vocal about trivial garbage like that than they are about any real serious problems facing them. So are white liberals who like to feign indignation at every chance they get.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If blacks attempt to make in roads or improve it never gets any attention. This just shows AMERICAS obession with focusing on black failure. Even if they attempt to make changes.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Focusing on black failure? Every major media outlet bends over backwards to focus on any black success story they can find, even though very few of them come from fields of any more substance than entertainment. Ironically, the writer of this piece definitely qualifies as one of those few, and he is hated and berated by most of both the black and mainstream media.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ive seen many give up gang life complete high school with honors, just in time to go to college and make something of themselves.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Apparently, not enough. I guarantee that for every one you&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;ve seen ten who did not, most of them when I was living in Baltimore.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Now all they have to do teach their fellow brethern to do the same.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Best of luck with that. Seriously. Ask Dr. Williams, or Bill Cosby, or Jesse Lee Peterson, or Thomas Sowell, or [insert name of black public figure with half a lick of sense here], just how well it&rsquo;s been working for them.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Remember all stories are different so lumping blacks into a group would be wrong.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Perhaps, but the vast majority of them do share certain characteristics which, when left unchecked, appear to invariably lead to the problems which plague them and, ultimately, us. </p>

			<p>To Cuban Woman:</p>
<p>I disagree with you wholeheartedly. Blacks enjoy a level of &#8220;group success&#8221; unknown to practically any other ethnic community in this country, including Hispanics. </p>
<p>Surely you&rsquo;ll agree there&rsquo;s no Cuban history month; however, every February we&rsquo;re deluged with afrocentrism. An entire month of politically correct, historically revised, wholly overstated &#8220;accomplishments,&#8221; &#8220;successes,&#8221; and &#8220;contributions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presidents&rsquo; Day essentially &#8220;lumps&#8221; together, in hamhanded fashion, the likes of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, men who literally shaped the world as we know it today. Yet Martin Luther King, Jr., a known philanderer and plagiarist, is the only American &#8220;honored&#8221; with an individual Federal holiday. </p>
<p>You posted that America is obsessed with black failure, yet I don&rsquo;t think you could be any farther from the truth. If anything, those who guide American cultural imperatives see to it that everyone knows: The heroics of the &#8220;saintly&#8221; Rosa Parks; the &#8220;savior&#8221; Ben Cardin; the &#8220;genius&#8221; George Washington Carver; the &#8220;heroic&#8221; Tuskegee Airmen; on and on, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>However, do you think the average black American could identify any of these noteworthy Cubans: Arnaldo Tamayo Mendez (first Cuban cosmonaut in space)? Luis Alvarez (Nobel Prize winner for physics)? Jose Raul Capablanca (the &#8220;Mozart of Chess&#8221;)?</p>
<p>Not likely&hellip;as a matter of fact, very few Americans could identify these Cubans. Why not? Because the only ethnocentric history that gets any attention in this country is that of blacks, however limited their contributions may actually have been. </p>
<p>Yes, all stories are different. Yes, assumptions about a group can often be wrong. However, no one deserves what they haven&rsquo;t earned, and you want blacks - as a group - put in a position of prominence they don&rsquo;t rightly deserve. <br>

<p>Umm&hellip; Okay so lets analyse this, why is the black middle class on the rise, why is the black population going to be at a stand still. Why are the majority of blacks middle class (+60%)?<br>
Violence will go down long with time. Some stories are different, some blacks were forced into gang life by their peers and some need it for protection. </p>

<p>If some of them get into the gang scene &#8220;because of their peers,&#8221; then who are their peers?  They&rsquo;re also black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the bromide I used to hear a lot from black mothers whose teenage sons get arrested for murder   &mdash;   &#8220;He was a good boy, who just happened to get caught up in the wrong crowd.&#8221;  I heard it so often that I started to wonder if they all just got caught up in the wrong crowd, who was the wrong crowd?  The most obvious solution is that they were the wrong crowd.  And these mothers just sat back as their sons got closer and closer to gang life without a serious moment of discipline.</p>
