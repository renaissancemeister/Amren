<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6279722.html">Legislator: Rodeo Needs to Hire Minorities, Open Books</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Murphy, Houston Chronicle, February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State Sen. Mario Gallegos said he will be filing a bill Friday that would require the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo to contract with more minority-owned businesses, include minorities on its board and comply with open records requests.</p>
<p>Gallegos said he and other minority leaders urged action on the same issues during a meeting last week with rodeo officials but were told that the rodeo could not address their demands  &mdash;  it has a show to put on starting next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s time they break the good ole boy system and start doing what&rsquo;s right, period,&#8221; said Johnny Mata, the former head of the local chapter of League of United Latin American Citizens, who attended the meeting. &#8220;I am a firm believer that we can meet halfway.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They just told the DOJ they thought it was pointless,&#8221; Gallegos [a Houston Democrat] said. &#8220;I want to know what they do with their money. They are the largest cash cow in Houston.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rodeo generates more than $80 million in revenues annually.</p>
<p>Leroy Shafer, the rodeo&rsquo;s chief operating officer, said the nonprofit organization would not comment on the bill because officials have not seen it. The rodeo&rsquo;s lobbyist was rebuffed when he tried to meet with Gallegos or his aides in the past three weeks to discuss the legislation, Shafer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shafer said the rodeo continues to encourage minorities to attend the show, secure contracts from the rodeo, seek scholarships and rise to leadership posts.</p>
<p>He said the rodeo has a strong record on issues of diversity. It is one of the leading providers of college scholarships to minorities in the area, Shafer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No minorities or women serve on the rodeo&rsquo;s 19-member executive committee, but those posts are filled in part based on years of volunteer service at the show, Shafer said. The average years of service for committee members is 37.5, and minorities, he said, haven&rsquo;t yet worked their way onto the committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The legislation appears to fit only the rodeo, which leases space at Reliant Park from the Harris County Sports &amp; Convention Corp.</p>
<p>It would require the rodeo&rsquo;s executive committee to reflect the county&rsquo;s ethnic and racial demographics and that the rodeo &#8220;make a reasonable effort&#8221; to award contracts to minority-owned firms.</p>
<p>When the Super Bowl was held in Houston in 2004, the NFL tried to make sure some minority- and women-owned businesses were awarded contracts related to the game and its festivities through a small-business program.</p>

			<p>You folk are in danger of losing your all constitutional rights .</p>
<p>Freedom of speech has all but disapeared under the guise of PC.<br>
Now freedom of association is under threat. I wonder what other rights have slowly been eroded that you&rsquo;re not even aware of. When are you going to do something about it???</p>

			<p>Gallegos is involved in the same game of GOVERNMENT forcing &#8220;protected classes&#8221; into businesses that most have no experience with, and many are not even interested in. But it serves the Mexican ethnic interest groups agenda, which is all that Gallegos cares about. Listen to this piece of arrogance  &mdash;  &#8220;it&rsquo;s time they break the good ole boy system and start doing what&rsquo;s right,period&#8221;, said Johnny Mata, the former head of the local chapter of, ARE YOU READY FOLKS?, LEAGUE OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS, surprise, surprise, LULAC. Can&rsquo;t you just feel the arrogance exuding out of this clown, Johnny Mata?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t there be a good ole boys system Senor Mata? Why can&rsquo;t people prefer to deal with their friends and family, in their businesses etc. The Mexicans in business certainly do. Some would say that is why LULAC, THE LEAGUE OF LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS EXISTS, WOULDN&rsquo;T THEY MR. MATA? The article goes on, the rodeos lobbyist was rebuffed when he tried to meet with Gallegos, etc. etc&hellip; Can you feel the arrogance and the entitlement of Gallegos and Company??</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep myself from telling Gallegos to mind his own business, and continue to do what he does best, look out for the best interests of illegal aliens from Mexico. Then I&rsquo;d like to ask him why he thinks they should have such a great interest in American rodeo. Afterall, it isn&rsquo;t horse tripping, bullfighting, cock fighting, or any other bloody sport that so many of these folks enjoy. Yeah, this article and the arrogance of another representative of a &#8220;protected class&#8221;, using his government position to bully private citizens, tees me off.</p>

			<p>The average member of the executive committee has 37.5 years of volunteer service.  Yes, that&rsquo;s a good old boy network, and what of it?  How many Hispanics and Blacks give a couple hundred hours of their time every year to some unpaid public service?  In Pasadena, California, the Tournament of Roses was similarly attacked, and forced to put Blacks on their Board of Directors.  Of course, the intelligent Whites who organize the Rose Parade have managed to work around the minority millstones, but for how long?  The Blacks on the  board will raise a stink sooner or later, the politicians will back them, and real control will gradually shift to the incompetent.  The people at the Houston Rodeo must refuse to back down.  Better to dissolve the organization than hand it over, so that everyone will know what happened.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all you need to know.</p>
<p>Whites, through their own work and efforts have generated wealth and the upstarts and interlopers want what they can&rsquo;t produce themselves.</p>

			<p>nice to see our hispanic brothers are able to climb aboard the Oppressed Minority Shakedown Express. I wonder if jesse and al will make them sit at the back of the train?</p>

			<p>I note that Gallegos sayts the rodeo is the &#8220;largest cash cow&#8221; in Houston, TX with revenues of $ 80 million. If I interpret that correctly, then what does the petroleum industry generate in Houston? The aerospace industry? The entertainment industry?</p>
<p>Does Gallegos know about the Professional Bull Riders Association? Does he know about the Brazilian bull riders who have made their mark on the sport since its inception? Or does he not consider Brazilians to be Hispanics?</p>
<p>Somebody should introduce Gallegos to PBR stock contractor Julio Moreno, one of the top men in the field.</p>

			<p>I would like to see some more diversity in Rodeo.  How about we put Gallegos and Mata up on ol&rsquo; Bonebuster the killer Brahman bull and let them go.  Maybe we could put a couple of them in for rodeo clowns&hellip;..oh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&hellip;. I just realized, they don&rsquo;t want to be part of the rodeo, they are seeking money for nothing.  What a shock.</p>

			<p>Mario Gallegos is importing Mexican cultural practices. In Mexico it is commonplace for politicians to use the power of the state to blackmail and extort money from businesses.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ve been busy at work trying to multi-culturalize golf, hockey, NASCAR, country music and now this.  The message is clear - they believe whites don&rsquo;t have a right to festivals, celebrations or events where their demographic dominate. Yet, you won&rsquo;t see pushes for diversity for a black celebration, but wait, the whites that do show up are the ones who think having token black friends makes them enlightened.</p>

			<p>Mark, You have that EXACTLY right!! </p>
<p>I agree, better to dissolve it to give in and then see how the people of Houston howl about losing all the tourist money that the rodeo attracts.  </p>
<p>Mexicans are extremely cruel to animals and rodeo animals in particular.  Do I have my facts wrong, or is it their culture that will put two stallions in a pen with a mare and watch them fight?   </p>

			<p>To Brigand:</p>
<p>To be a bull fighter (as the erstwhile &#8220;rodeo clowns&#8221; are now called) takes a certain kamikaze type attitude, one that I sorely find lacking in Hispanics like Gallegos and Mata. A bull fighter has to get his body between an animal that weighs the equivalent of six 300-pound football players, and a cowboy who either rides the bull for 8 seconds or gets bucked off.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, USA Today ran a series of articles on the most dangerous sports-related occupations. They said a bull fighter was No. 3. They profiled the PBR&rsquo;s Rob Smets (now retired).</p>

			<p>To Soprano Fan:<br>
     I didn&rsquo;t mean to insinuate in any way that Gallegos, Mata, or any other hispanic I know has the guts or bravery to actually ride a bull or act as a rodeo clown (which I do consider to be the most dangerous job).  I have all the respect in the world for those men.  I have less than zero respect for these south-of-the-unenforced-border holdup scoundrels.  If you truly want to be part of the upper echelons of the rodeo, they should start by cleaning out pens and work their way up over many years just like the whites do.</p>

			<p>To BRIGAND:</p>
<p>I realize the sarcasm in your earlier post. Gallegos wants a free hand-out. Drill him and the horse he rode in on. He is blind to the fact that several Brazilians have done quite well in the bull riding tournaments. Those guys came into the series like every other cowboy, asking for no special favors. Gallegos and Mata can suck eggs. </p>

<p>This is simply code for &#8220;I&rsquo;m willing to settle for only half of the money someone else worked to earn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is Gallegos aware that extortion is a felony?</p>
