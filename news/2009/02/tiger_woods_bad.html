<h1>Tiger Woods&rsquo; Bad Tip</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roger Singer, New York Post, February 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Waitstaff of the world, be warned: When Tiger Woods walks into your eatery, don&rsquo;t expect a gratuity after the meal is over. While he may have a golden grip on his golf clubs, he has a pretty firm grasp on his wallet, too. &#8220;Whenever Tiger was in Las Vegas, there was a woman who would hang out with his group, sort of as a local guide,&#8221; says our source. &#8220;They would have a great time but Tiger never tips. Ever. She had to stop going out with him because it would cost her three or four hundred bucks every time they went out, since she had to keep tipping for him. Even though he paid the bill, people knew her, so [to not leave a gratuity] would reflect badly on her.&#8221; Here&rsquo;s a tip for Tiger: Even 10 percent is better than nothing!</p>

			<p>What gets me is that he made the vast bulk of his money through endorsements. Do people really believe I&rsquo;m going to buy a car because Woods is in a commercial saying he&rsquo;s &#8220;not Igor&#8221;? I&rsquo;ve never understood this. As for his not tipping, this mean-spiritedness is typical of blacks. I know a lot of waitresses and they all say blacks are the worst customers to have.</p>

			<p>Food servers will say that blacks are notoriously bad tippers. When people are not anxious to wait on them, blacks will say it is racism. They always fail to see that it is their behavior that turns people off, rather than their color.</p>

			<p>Heard Fred Mc Murray was the same way. Would leave a dime he would. Some of the better tips I have had thru 25 years standing behind the formica&hellip; $500 on 35.00 from two business executives who then arranged a job transfer for me from a downtown  bus station bar near their  favorite hotel  to a Houlihan`s so they could have a better place to drink. Then there was  $200.00 twice weekly from a Denver Oil Company Owner who  instructed me to start and pay for a bowling league for my kitchen staff to build esprit de corps. (He  then handed the head cook the private number of his Lear Jet pilot in front of me so the $6.75 an hour employee could be flown to Colorado Corporate HQ. to snitch me off if I ever went cheapo!) But the best was Gene, A Death of a Salesman/Willy Loman type who would leave 65 cents on a piece of pie and coffee and all the off color jokes you could take in while glancing  over at the rest of your customers till they needed something. All three guys were the type you begged not to leave a tip or pay the bill period because they made you feel like one of them. <br>
  Honorable mention also goes to Phil. He was a 75 year old  man who had  supported a family selling Your Name Here on keychains and Pencils etc. His only son was born when Phil was 52. On College graduation day he confided in me proudly that in four years of college his son had only made two B`s. I took a sip of Pepsi, a drag off a cigerette and countered boldly, &#8220;So What?!? In four years of College I only made two B`s also!&#8221; The glint  of embarressment in his eye and the look of fatherly humility when he got my meaning was priceless. Next day I showed up and there was a  rusty $65 BBQ smoker padlocked to the dumpster with a ribbon around it with My Name There on a key chain and a fistful of pencils&hellip;</p>

			<p>In college I waited tables. This is absolutely true. I remember one hostess who had it in for me and seated my section entirely with blacks. I let it happen and the manager was gracious enough to fire her when I asked him to take a look and if he noticed anything odd. And when dining with blacks and they pick up the check, I have had to fix the tip frequently- even when they were on expense accounts. </p>
<p>I also had a friend who owned a limo company years back, and I would moonlight on busy occasions. Conversely, blacks were overall better tippers than whites or any other race if you drove them around in a long car. Go figure.</p>

			<p>Oh that big Tiger smile!  Looks likes he&rsquo;s sooo generous!  No tips fo da White man though! Or the White woman.  That should tell us how much he likes White people.  Oh wait a minute!  The story didn&rsquo;t say if it was only White people that he wasn&rsquo;t tipping!  I stand corrected.  Knowing who takes waiter, waitress, and busboy jobs today (just look south) it would appear that Tiger boy (No racial slur intended) does not particularly care for Hispanics.  But that&rsquo;s okay.  Only White people can be racist.  Everyone knows that.</p>

			<p>I work a tip based job in Las Vegas and most blacks do not tip. The best tippers are White-Americans from California or the east coast. New Yorkers and Chicagoans tip well. Mexicans are worst than blacks as far as tipping goes. Asians are really bad too. Europeans are bad, but not as bad as Asians or Mexicans. </p>
<p>If not for White Americans I would not be able to leave a comment. My new computer was bought from money I win betting   on sports. That money comes from my tips. Thank you White America.</p>

			<p>I briefly worked as a waitress about 34 years ago, and found this to be true, although it wasn&rsquo;t a fancy place  &mdash;  just a Bob&rsquo;s Big Boy.  One night there was a group of at least a dozen blacks, all of whom ordered a dinner and most of whom ordered a dessert.  They really ran us around getting things for them. </p>
<p>They left 75 cents to split between two of us waitresses. </p>

			<p>I agree with Tiger.  He&rsquo;d be critised more unless he gave really generous tips.  Where will that end.  He&rsquo;d be expected to give bigger &amp; bigger tips every time he ventured out.</p>
<p>Give no tips &amp; every one will know where they stand.</p>

When the subject of tipping came up in a previous Amren story, there was an enormous number of comments from people who had worked as waiters and waitresses.  The consistency of their views  &mdash;   that blacks generally are very stingy with tips  &mdash;   was surprising. I became convinced that it is a fair generalization.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, Tiger Woods is just one guy. And he is not an &#8220;African-American.&#8221;)</p>

			<p>Blacks are weird about tipping.  After 10 years in restaurants, I can say I would prefer to never wait on another one because they seem to use service establishments as a place to assert themselves as if they are petty tyrants.  But occasionally, you will get a ridiculously generous tip when you would feel it is uncalled for. Not often mind you, but it does happen.  </p>
<p>Whites are generally more consistent and Asians generally a little cheaper.  Blacks are generally the ones that run you ragged, have a lousy attitude, and want you to know that you are there to &#8220;serve them.&#8221;  I will give good service but I won&rsquo;t kiss you butt, I don&rsquo;t care who you are.   Blacks seem to want their butts kissed to make up for perceived &#8220;wrongs.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Sorry, but theres nothing wrong with not tipping. Id rather blame the people who DO tip and thereby make the staff think they have a god-given right to more money just for doing their jobs.</p>

			<p>About twenty years ago when I was young and (very) foolish, I went out to dinner with a black male friend. He paid the tab and when the waiter brought the change, which was less than a dollar, he took all the coins. As we got ready to leave the table, I asked if he was going to leave a tip, and he said no. I then said I would leave it hoping to shame him, but much to my surprise, he didnt seem embarrassed by what I did (and knowing what I know now, he probably thought I was an idiot for wasting my money on a tip). At any rate, it was an eye opener and I wasnt friends with him much longer and good riddance too. </p>

			<p>DO AWAY WITH TIPPING ALTOGETHER, AND HAVE THESE EXPLOITING RESTAURANTS PAY THEIR PEOPLE AN APPROPRIATE WAGE. IF THEY HAVE TO CHARGE MORE FOR THE FOOD, SO BE IT. AT LEAST NOBODY GETS LEFT OUT, AND NOTHING IS OPTIONAL. BLACKS WILL THEN HAVE TO PAY THEIR SHARE.</p>

			<p>Well Graham, lets let Tiger know where he stands by giving him the service he deservers. Bad service. </p>
<p>Tipping is a custom in the US, true. It&rsquo;s not necessary, but it&rsquo;s a custom that most whites follow, while blacks and mexicans do not, never mind these two groups trying to run out on the bill more than any other ethnic group. Asians are generally bad, with Chinese and Koreans being the worst. Most Japanese were actually ok during my time as a waiter while attending college. The most demanding customers by far were blacks who were generally rude, loud, messy along with trying not to pay and almost never leaving tips. The waiters and waitresses would do a coin toss or stone - paper -scissors when black customers came in, and this included two black waitresses. No one wanted to serve blacks. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they really aren&rsquo;t.  The wait staff is paid minimum wage, or sometimes less, to do a job that in similar circumstances would pay a much higher wage.  The ten to fifteen percent gratuity is basically deducted from their wages, as it&rsquo;s expected that they will make up at least the difference in tips.  BTW  &mdash;  do you have anything else in common with Tiger Woods, since you don&rsquo;t see the point in tipping?</p>

			<p>First, this guy is mostly of something other than black. </p>
<p>Second, blacks don&rsquo;t tip if they get bad service or don&rsquo;t have the money (especially in this crisis)</p>
<p>Third, he&rsquo;s married to a white woman and doesn&rsquo;t like being called black nor does he have it in for whites.</p>
<p>And finally, he built a private school in a white neighborhood so I guess he&rsquo;s even, or at least in my book he is.</p>

			<p>Tiger Woods is only a quarter Black. His dad was half Black, half Chinese/Indian. Tiger Woods hates being lumped in with Black people. Tiger Woods is not like most Black people in his manners or actions, though he may have picked up his tipping habits from his half Black dad. </p>

<p>   Yes, waiters are paid - about $2.13 an hour.  At least that&rsquo;s what I made when I waited tables in college a couple of years ago.  I can concur with several of the other posters here about how terrible it was to wait on black people.  Black customers were generally rude, overly demanding, loud and obnoxious, complained about their food and the prices, and took about ten times as long to order as a typical white family. <br>
   I could literally write a book about my encounters with black customers.  I saw black customers get in fistfights with other customers.  I saw a black customer rip up money in front of a waitress because he was made about his bill.  I saw security having to be called on a black customer because he refused to stop groping a white waitress.  I saw numerous black customers run out on their bill.  I had several black female customers offer to have sex with me in the bathroom just minutes after meeting them.  I was called every racial slur in the book.  I even had customers threaten to kill me for no apparent reason.  And all of this was at a &#8220;family&#8221; restaraunt. The list could go on and on.<br>
   It took about as much effort to wait on one table of blacks as it did to wait on about three or four tables of whites.  One of my black co-workers even said to me once, &#8220;I feel ashamed that when the hostess tells me I&rsquo;ve got a new table and go out there and see someone with my own skin color that I know I&rsquo;m in trouble.&#8221;  I lived in town that was about half-black, half-lower middle class white, so my customer base was pretty evenly split.  One weekend I decided to do an experiment - I kept track of the tips I got from blacks and whites based on the percentage of their bills.  At the end of the weekend, I calculated that the average white family left me a tip of about 16-17%; the average black family left me 4-5%.</p>

			<p>I have worked in several fine dining establishments, the sort of places where Tiger Woods is likely to hang out. At places like this, the server is on the hook for a certain percentage of &#8220;tip-out&#8221;, money paid to the bartenders, sommelier, back waiters, bussers. How this generally works is that for every $100 dollars sold by a waiter, he or she OWES between 3 and 10 dollars to the house. Better establishments expect their staff to earn 20% tips or better on every check, so that tip-out is usually required rather than being optional. </p>
<p>This means that the richest athlete in history, black or white, is taking money out of the pockets of the working class Whites who wait on him. </p>

			<p>To the New Zealander -</p>
<p>Waitstaff and bartenders in the United States are not paid even the official minimum wage.  They are paid a small amount per hour (typically between $2 - $4) that essentially covers about 50-70% of their taxes.  Most do not receive a paycheck, and must cover the shortfall in their tax obligation out-of-pocket.  I worked as a waiter/bartender for years and made $2.38 per hour.  The legal minimum wage at the time was just under $8/hour.</p>
<p>This is legal in the U.S. because it is accepted and EXPECTED that customers will tip.  The industry standard for competent service is 15-20%.  My establishment would add a 17% gratuity to a bill for parties of five or more to ensure that the waiter would be paid.  When a customer does not tip, or tips a pitifully small amount, the waiter is not only not making any money - he or she is actually losing money.  Taxes at the end of the fiscal year are compiled by the total gross sales of a waiter (not their reported earning in tips) as it is assumed the waiter is netting at least 10% of their sales in tip earnings.  Waiters must &#8216;tip out&rsquo; at the end of each night, meaning they must pay their busboys and service bartender a small percentage of their earnings (again determined by their gross sales regardless of their actual tip income.)  Clearly, when a patron then does not tip, the waiter is still responsible to the government (taxes) and fellow employees (tip out) for the assumed revenue.</p>
<p>This is why waiters are loathe to wait on blacks and, usually, Europeans.  The blacks tend not to tip out of selfishness, while those from other countries (understandably) do not recognize that the waiter isn&rsquo;t &#8216;a paid employee&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Hope that clears it up.</p>

			<p>I lived in the USA in the late 1960s working on a 2-year contract so I am familiar with the US tipping culture.  But here in Europe, tipping is merely leaving any loose change which then usually goes into a jar for all the waiters to share.  On business visits to New Zealand many years ago, the menus (or on notices prominently displayed) used have printed in them,  &#8220;Please do not tip as it can offend&#8221;. and the staff there received good wages and did not have to rely on tips which is as it should be: but each to their own.  But tourists to the USA from such countries as in Europe can find it quite expensive to be expected to tip and as we found on a recent holiday to New York, the expectd percentage now is 20%, not the 10& of old.   It is a culture shock and here in Spain, no one is upset if you do not tip as they are paid reasonable wages so any tip is purely for good service, not out of any automatic expectations by the staff which makes la propina that much nicer.</p>

			<p>The restaurant should reserve the right to add the gratuity where needed.  </p>
<p>I went to a club meeting at Sagebrush recently and the tip was added, and still I heard many members tell her to &#8220;keep the change&#8221; when the bills on average were $17.00 WITH tip, and they handed her a $20.  uh,,.. WHITE PEOPLE.</p>

			<p>I have never been a big fan of tipping. A meal at a restaurant is usually expensive enough without having to pay the waitstaff twice for the same service. Why don&rsquo;t American business owners just put it in the price and pay their staff more?</p>
<p>I believe a smile and a thank you sound be suffice at the end of a good meal.</p>

<p> Do you personally KNOW him? This just shows you how a carefully crafted P.R. image is created about so-called celebrities and people buy into it. How many Americans thought O.J. Simpson was a really swell guy BEFORE his ex-wife was murdered. Americans are way too gullible and buy into way too much hype and P.R. nonsense about Athletes and actors. It&rsquo;s really ridiculous.</p>

I always tip although my main problem is that the rules are nebulous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to leave 15% BUT you&rsquo;re also supposed to tip based on the quality of service. While I&rsquo;ve never gotten service that was so horrible I withheld a tip, I&rsquo;m always confused about the standards I&rsquo;m supposed go by.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve never eaten at a restaurant before and never had this server, how can I know if I&rsquo;m getting standard service or exceptional service? Is smiling a lot and being overly friendly exceptional service?</p>
<p>I would like to see tipping done away with just because it&rsquo;s subjective. Add it to the bill and pay the staff more.</p>
<p>Until then, it&rsquo;s part of our culture. So I always leave the minimum 15% but if I have the odd change, I&rsquo;ll add more.</p>
<p>If you use a service industry that historically requires tipping, you should tip.<br>

<p>Why yes - you&rsquo;ve discovered my secret:<br>
I AM A NON-WHITE DISINFO AGENT!<br>
Actually, no - it&rsquo;s just that New Zealanders have never had any informal requirement for tipping - we do tip for good service, but NZ staff are paid a good wage anyway.</p>
<p>Seriously, you guys <i>do</i> know that by tipping - or the expectation of <i>mandatory</i> tipping - you&rsquo;re really harming the servers, right?<br>
If tipping was not required, servers would then agitate for higher wages - the only guys that win are the managers or business owners, as they have to pay less for staff wages.</p>

<p>Can you name a favorable characteristic where blacks are better than whites? Name one. Are they more patriotic, law abiding, charitable, harder working, better parents etc.)?</p>
<p>About the only thing I can think of is in athletics where blacks have more fleeting glory than whites. Never mind that over 99% of blacks are has-beens in sports by the time they are 22 years old.</p>
<p>They use to be more musically-inclined than whites but rap music dstroyed that.</p>

			<p>I worked as a host for a year in a nice restaurant and everyone of the employees from waitresses to managers even the blacks all knew and talked openly about the racial hierarchy of good customers. Of course whites and asians at top and persians and black and the bottom. All the in between ethnics were variable meaning it depended on how much you were like them whether you spoke there language or looked like them. And everyone was always upset when they got one of the tables that they &#8216;knew&rsquo; werent going to tip. </p>

<p>No, not true.  Here in the US, servers are paid a different way than they are in Europe etc.. American servers get most of their wages from tips whereas servers in other countries get theirs from a straight salary. Often, american servers can do quite well and can make much more in tips rather than if they got a straight salary, which is why many prefer the tip system. Most americans like the tipping system and it&rsquo;s the one area of custom service that you can actually do something about if the service is poor. I find europe and other non-tipping places expensive because the price of meal is higher due to the higher wages the servers get as well as the higher taxes.</p>

<p> American servers, most of them, do not want to agitate for higher wages because they  make more with tips. Many of the non-americans on here are judging this custom by their own country&rsquo;s  customs. Tipping is an ingrained custom here in the USA just like non-tipping is in your country. Anybody who applies for a waiter job in the US knows how they will be paid, mainly in tips, just like some sales staff are paid only in commission. While some of the non-americans on here find this unfair, many americans would find your system of not tipping equally unfair. Here in America, most of us have no desire to change our way of paying waiters. If a waiter here gives lousy service or is surly, I don&rsquo;t have to pay for it. This is why I find service usually, not always but usually,  better in the US than in non-tipping countries. In America, tipping is very important in our culture and not doing it is a big no-no.<br>

<p>Well, they just want to keep up with inflation.  The higher the rate of inflation, the larger the tip.</p>

			<p>Bob&rsquo;s Big Boy&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of years ago.  I have no idea why that chain flamed out.  I happened to be searching on the internet one time for Bob&rsquo;s Big Boy.  Found a photo posted showing a Bob&rsquo;s Big Boy plastic character still surviving all by itself out in the California desert.  I guess it was the last of the last.  A West Coast icon.  Maybe it will end up in a museum.</p>
<p>I also liked a restaurant chain called Hobo Joe&rsquo;s.  They&rsquo;re gone, too.  I don&rsquo;t know its flame out story either.</p>

			<p>First off, tips means &#8216;to insure prompt service&rsquo;. </p>
<p>That is the acronym I was taught some years ago (back when I was in college, and started eating out). So, tipping is a MEASURE OF THE SERVICE you have received via the waitstaff, the cook, and the restaurant.</p>
<p>I feel very little sympathy for those who work in restaurants. Mom and Pop joints are different; I would patronize them on a regular basis, IF there were any LEFT.</p>
<p>But the big chains serve food that is GMO, laden with high fructose corn syrup, modified food starch, MSG (call it what you will, it is THIS chemical) and a whole host of other chemicals, rather than REAL FOOD. Eating at anything less than a $25.00 a person plate establishment, often gets me physically ill from the chemicals. I&rsquo;ve developed this sensitivity precisely BECAUSE restaurants are CHEAP- one meal for one person at a local Big Boy, Dennys, or Perkins costs (on average) the same as almost a week&rsquo;s worth of groceries! </p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not the server&rsquo;s fault, but the management. My family rarely eats out anymore, unless it is trying to fit in a busy schedule with kids, and their dance, sports, and music classes. But, even here, we are coming to the conclusion in this economy, that PB&J; sandwiches on a whole-grain bread, thermoses of cold raw milk, and organically grown fruit are better for our kids than the latest &#8216;[cr]Happy Meal&rsquo; that will merely make my kids obese before they are 12.</p>
<p>As for &#8216;the Woods&rsquo;? I stopped thinking golf was a civilized sport, years ago, when that visage began to appear. Sorry, but as a Celt, I am not interested in minorities invading my culture. THat he is being &#8216;frugal&rsquo; may be a virtue, but only when it comes to MY people.<br>
Part of the reason</p>

			<p>here I&rsquo;m not going to dump on Tiger because he is &#8220;black&#8221;. He isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s quite a mixture as you all know. Are Asians great tippers? I don&rsquo;t know but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they weren&rsquo;t. Tipping is a Euro-American custom. A good custom. </p>
<p>In practically every other activity, Tiger seems quite &#8220;white&#8221; from a cultural view and he has done tangible charitable giving, something blacks with money often do NOT do.  I could be wrong and would be interested in other informatiion about Tiger, but for now I think it&rsquo;s fair to say he&rsquo;s cheap on tipping, and that negative could apply to many folks of many backgrounds. </p>
<p>Blacks are screwing up our culture and liberty, but not because of Tiger Woods, IMO.</p>

			<p>Its not about Tiger   &mdash;   who is a far better golfer than I will ever be. Rather, it is about the black race in general who regard their position in life as one of entitlement! That is, whitey is expected to pay them for wrongs allegedly committed against their ancestors over one hundred and forty years ago. They are the privileged class and therefore everything in life is expected to be free [at least for them]!</p>
<p>There is an all white, all night, pizza, uppy guppy bar, replete with polo button down shirts, khaki pants, and &#8220;gator sweaters&#8221;  that I regularly enjoy. There is exactly one attractive, well educated, black waitress in the whole place. Knowing how politically correct I am, it should come as no surprise to the regulars here, that I would take it upon myself to ask her directly one night why she would choose to work in an &#8220;all white, all night, pizza joint&#8221;? </p>
<p>She replied: &#8220;You think I&rsquo;m crazy? Whites tip, blacks don&rsquo;t! I usually make over three hundred dollars a week in tips working four nights a week. If this were a black bar, I would rarely make over thirty dollars a week plus I would have to put up with all of the gang bangers waiting to have sex with me since they  left me a tip!&#8221;  </p>
<p>Moral: Blacks know that blacks act black even with respect to dealing with blacks!</p>

			<p>The IRS TAXES!! wait staff as if they make more than minimum wage, whether they do in fact or not. Employers usually pay waitstaff LESS than minimum wage, and the staff is assumed to make up the difference in tips to bring the total to or greater than minimum wage. This is seldom the case, but the wait staff STILL!!!! must pay the taxes as if they were making at least minimum wages. My former wife did this for a while and I have many friends who still do it and it is a sad way to make a living putting up with the disrespect and outright rudness in many cases. I tip well, and I will continue to do so.</p>

I HATE it!<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I hate it too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t stiff anyone for a tip, if I&rsquo;m in such a place. I cough up what is expected. But I rarely go back.<br>
Ordinarily, I just don&rsquo;t go to places that require tipping. I avoid waiter service if possible.  Thus, they&rsquo;re cutting their own throats. They&rsquo;re losing both my tip and my business too. I take my money elsewhere.</p>
<p>As Europeans and others believe, tipping is degrading to the server and embarassing to the tipper. It is merely a disguised form of begging. Master patronizing servant. I dislike it and try to avoid it. Many other countries have abolished it and we should do the same. Some Americans on this site have practically boasted that it is a superior system. It is not!  It is an embarassment to us.  Foreigners see it as a form of servility and backwardness. And I agree.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m in a restaurant with others, I am happy to pick up the full tab, and usually do. But I make it clear that while I&rsquo;m paying the bill, I&rsquo;m not leaving a tip. So, if the others wish, it&rsquo;s up to them if they care to leave a tip on their own. (They always do, and that&rsquo;s OK with me. But that&rsquo;s strictly their own business.)<br>
