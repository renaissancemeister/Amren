<h1>Black and Blue: Gang Cops Say It&rsquo;s OK to Profile. Others Call It Harassment.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Pitkin, Willamette Week (Portland, Oregon), January 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corno and Mahuna [Russ Corno and Pete Mahuna] are part of &#8220;Operation Cool Down,&#8221; an effort by City Hall to halt escalating violence between the Crips and Bloods after a slaying in a North Portland church Dec. 12.</p>
<p>Their new mission is straightforward: to contact the kind of people involved in the shootings and make a police presence felt.</p>
<p>Corno is frank about who they&rsquo;re targeting: young black men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statistics don&rsquo;t lie,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You gotta go where the numbers go.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Corno and Mahuna, the numbers go where an exercise in community policing means walking a racial divide. Because it is, in fact, young black men who have been pulling triggers and taking bullets for the past six weeks. But Corno and Mahuna are a white guy and a Pacific Islander, respectively, whose perceptions are formed by 12 years as Portland gang cops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Their tactics at first drew anger and disbelief from the people they met. That reaction often dissolved after they explained their mission and traded a little street banter. But the encounter clearly left many people rattled  &mdash;  which police say is precisely the point.</p>
<p>Driving down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard at 7 pm, Corno and Mahuna spot a 15-year-old black boy in a hoodie at the intersection of North Morgan Street. They&rsquo;ve already passed two groups of white people without stopping. But a week ago, police had busted three gang members carrying guns two blocks away.</p>
<p>Corno and Mahuna pull over, get out of the car and ask the boy what he&rsquo;s doing. He says he was on his way to a bus stop and is shocked when Mahuna asks him to put his hands behind his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I do?&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Mahuna pats him down for weapons, checks his ID, and asks him to show his forearms and stomach for gang tattoos. With no guns or tats, they send him on his way after a brief chat about the latest violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Corno and Mahuna were doing surveillance in North Portland&rsquo;s New Columbia villa when gunfire erupted just a block away. To protect their own safety and take weapons off the street, Corno says the patdowns make sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kids are comfortable standing on the streets holding guns because they&rsquo;re not afraid of the police,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If they know every time they stand on a street corner a police car is going to drive by and talk to them, then when they get in a fight all they&rsquo;ll have is fists, not guns.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact it&rsquo;s mainly black men they&rsquo;re approaching is not a problem, Corno says. They also frisk two Latino men that night. If the mission were suppressing meth in Southeast Portland, he says, they&rsquo;d target a different set of people altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;Profiling  &mdash;  to me, I&rsquo;m not scared of that word,&#8221; Corno says. &#8220;If you&rsquo;re profiling people based just on their race, that is an issue. We&rsquo;re profiling people based on crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Isaac Nobles is drinking Milwaukee&rsquo;s Best Ice with three friends outside an apartment building on North Haight Street. Just around the corner on North Killingsworth Street, there&rsquo;d been shots fired the night before.</p>
<p>As Mahuna pats him down, Nobles, 23, says it&rsquo;s the second time that day they&rsquo;ve been questioned by police.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re prisoners in our own neighborhood,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I understand what you&rsquo;re trying to do, but I&rsquo;m getting tired of the interviews.&#8221;</p>
<p>His friend, L.B. Anderson, notes Barack Obama just became president.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&rsquo;re getting harassed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What is going on in this world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Corno asks Nobles why he&rsquo;s wearing a blue Chicago Cubs cap  &mdash;  a sign of the Crips  &mdash;  after a shooting just happened. Nobles denies he&rsquo;s involved in gangs and accuses Corno of stereotyping. Another friend accuses Corno and Mahuna of denying young blacks jobs.</p>
<p>After five minutes of conversation, the cops resolve the tension. They leave after shaking hands, with no arrests or citations. In the end, Nobles even admits he comes from a Crip family.</p>

			<p>The fact of the matter is that young whites are also profiled racially while they&rsquo;re in black neighborhoods, especially at night.  The reason is that the main reason for young whites to be in black neighborhoods is to buy drugs.</p>
<p>Someone I know who used to live in a majority black neighborhood in St. Louis city, one that started white when he bought there, but has been &#8220;in transition&#8221; for years, has been mysteriously pulled over by city cops on several occasions in his own neighborhood at night.  When he presented his photo ID with his address showing he lived in the neighborhood, they let him go.  It&rsquo;s obvious   &mdash;   they thought he was there to buy dope.</p>

			<p>Profiling is a very important part of police work. A pickup leaving a quick stop with loud exhaust and a confederat flag in the rear window- probably has an open beer a few blocks down the road. (Profiling)  A young black teenager dressed as a gang banger in a very expensive car- probably stolen. (Profiling) A wealthy looking white girl sitting in a BMW at a stop light who will not look at you while waiting at the light- probably does not have a driver license. (Profiling) A skinny punk with open sores in a junker car twitching around like they are covered with bugs- probably has meth in the car. (Profiling)  Get the point? </p>

<p>Are the two gang officers also involved in the hiring of police? NO? <br>
Were you questioned at your place of employment?<br>
NO?<br>
Were you detained on your way to a job or job interview?<br>
NO?<br>
Huh, maybe your accusation is baseless?</p>

			<p>In 1995, I was in a day rehab hospital program with a hopeful member of the Bloods in Atlanta. Somehow 7 was chosen as his &#8216;lucky&rsquo; number. In iniation, the members beat him for 7 minutes. I don&rsquo;t know if the 7 minutes were finished or how he was turned over to the hospital. But he was in the day rehab, intimidating all of the patients, recovering from a severe head injury. I told him to quit picking on a younger girl(he had to have been under 18) and he thought he could threaten me. <br>
With the life I&rsquo;ve live, he don&rsquo;t want none of me!</p>
<p>Gangs, for members and non-members alike!</p>

			<p>Why do police get the authority to hassle and assault (frisk) people going peacably about their business?  Call me old fashion, but I&rsquo;d prefer not to have strangers fondle my thighs, groin and chest without a warrant.</p>
<p>It would be foolish not to increase police presence in a neighborhood riddled with gang violence. So walk the beat, talk with the teenage boys who appear to be in gangs, let them know police are there, just don&rsquo;t abolish the 4th ammendment. </p>

While I&rsquo;m not claiming for a second that whites are innocent of any and every crime, when I listen to local black talk radio, you&rsquo;d think white boys being caught in the park drinking beer should be treated the same as a black boys stabbing and shooting each other.</p>
<p>Blacks talk about all the crime committed by white boys in the white suburbs that aren&rsquo;t arrested and prosecuted. If white boys in the suburbs are murdering each other at the same rates as black boy, it&rsquo;s not making the local news and black have a legitimate point. Unfortunately under-age drinking is not the same as murder and it&rsquo;s not the white boys committing the murders.</p>
<p>Maybe these black boys should take up drinking beer. Then, just like the white boys, they too can get away with murder.</p>

<p>The siege of Portland has begun. And I don&rsquo;t mean gang bangers shooting at one another, I mean the liberals&rsquo; drive to push out the White people. </p>

<p>I call this the &#8216;what&rsquo;s that got to do with the price of tea in China&rsquo; syndrome or &#8216;black logic&rsquo; for short. I see this ALL the time. A black will come back with an argument and my first thought is, &#8220;&hellip; and your point is?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no point. That is the point. No logic. No reasoning. Dumb as dirt.</p>

<p>You are forgetting prostitition, and general mad-killer syndrome, where cops failed to check up on one Jeffrey Dahlmer, when they had the chance. There&rsquo;s no real fear of checking up on white citizens, either fear of the citizen or fear of the watchdogs. I once lived in a black neighborhood myself. <br>

<p>Went to a party where blacks were drinking a listening to music. Fist, insults, and knives began to fly. I left because of the atmosphere and as I was driving by the police had shown up with five squad cars.<br>

			<p>Sounds like decent, real world police work. Decent people of all races should approve of police work that, well works.</p>
<p>But remember the race riot (Black riot) in Detroit Michigan in 1968 that destroyed the city FOR EVER started when police were doing just regular police work, arresting Blacks caught in an illegal gambling den at 3 in the morning. The police didn&rsquo;t shoot anyone or serious beat down anyone, they just took out lots of Blacks accused of real criminal behavior and mobs formed and got all bent out of shape that THE PO-LEEEEECE were disrespecting some Black Brothers and soon the rioting and looting were on.</p>
<p>Unless these street wise cops in Portland have some back up plan about what to do in Black riots - not &#8220;race riots&#8221; but Black riots, they shouldn&rsquo;t be too confident their program that reduces crime in Black neighborhoods will work.</p>

			<p>Profiling goes on all the time.  A red car is more likely to be pulled over than a white car, for example.  Why?  Because typically the driver of a red car tends to be the type to want to show off.</p>

<p>Well, what race comprises the majority of the entire prison population?<br>
I&rsquo;ll give you a hint: It&rsquo;s not the white race!<br>
Or maybe you&rsquo;d like it if we let the blacks loose on the streets? Then these people can instill peace and prosperity in our neighborhoods? I DON&rsquo;T THINK SO.</p>
