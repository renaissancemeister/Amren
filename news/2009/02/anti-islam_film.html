<h1>Anti-Islam Film&rsquo;s Maker Blasts UK Over Ban</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Allen Greene and Melissa Gray, CNN, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Controversial Dutch filmmaker Geert Wilders condemned as &#8220;crazy and cowardly&#8221; Britain&rsquo;s refusal to let him enter the country Thursday.</p>
<p>Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker who produced a much-criticized film about Islam last year, flew to London for a screening of the movie despite being told a day earlier he would not be admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still believed and hoped that they would change their tune,&#8221; he told CNN by telephone, saying he was speaking from a detention room at London&rsquo;s Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>He said he was met by customs officers as soon as he left the plane.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took me to a detention center,&#8221; Wilders said, and there he was interviewed &#8220;for 45 seconds&#8221; before they took his passport and left. VideoWatch Wilders condemn British government »</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders had been invited to screen his film, &#8220;Fitna,&#8221; at the House of Lords on Thursday evening. {snip}</p>
<p>The British ambassador to the Netherlands told him Wednesday that he would be refused entry into Britain because the beliefs expressed in the film would threaten public security. </p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Home Office said barring Wilders is allowed under European Union law, which permits states to refuse entry on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government opposes extremism in all its forms,&#8221; said a Home Office spokesman, who would not be identified, in line with policy. &#8220;It will stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Caroline Cox, a member of Britain&rsquo;s House of Lords who is not affiliated with a political party, invited Wilders to screen his film at a private session in parliament. She told CNN that she wanted lawmakers to see the film to provoke discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re showing it on the basis of freedom of speech,&#8221; said Cox, who has been a free speech advocate throughout her career. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a serious showing, with serious concerns and serious consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s appalling,&#8221; she told CNN. &#8220;(For) the British government to prevent a European parliamentarian coming to speak to parliamentarians over here is very disturbing. I think it will be ready by many people as a sign of appeasement to threat and intimidation.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I read another version of this story, and you would think that Geert Wilders is Satan, Antichrist, the False Prophet and Adolph H. all rolled into one.  Of course, I can see the virtue in not letting him into the country, he might use Britain as a base from which to plot terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the London Subway System, and others.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s like the inmates calling the doctors crazy and cowardly.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything that slithers the earth that is more cowardly than a leftist wimp, I&rsquo;d be really interested in taking a look at it, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get a chance, because nothing lacks courage like leftist oddballs who insist on bringing people into the country who bomb buses and kill the natives.  Nothing. </p>

Neville Chamberlain was condemned for his appeasement overtures to Germany. Today, the British government does nothing but appease their new Muslim overlords.</p>

			<p>In all so-called Western nations, we&rsquo;ve put people in charge of our instutitions who are stupid and cowardly if not down right evil.  Britain is no different.  The cowards in charge of the government over there are a bunch of limp wristed weak sisters.</p>
<p>No wonder England is being invaded by Muslims.  The Muslims are just taking the path of least resistance and they know that they can control the wine and cheese wimps in charge of government as easily as a grown man or grown woman can control children in first grade.</p>

<p>Actually, the uncivilized and violent reaction by certain Muslims to those beliefs is what would threaten public security.  Yet those are the ones who are invited to stay in Britain.</p>

<p>i wonder who comes up with these &#8220;public policies&#8221;, and what defines &#8220;public security&#8221;.  sounds about right, the muslims over there can protest and hold signs that say &#8220;kill christians&#8221; but a white guy cant enter England to watch his own movie that is said to be &#8220;anti-islamic&#8221;.  </p>

			<p>Why does Britain fear Geert Wilders? Simple! He challenges Islam, and everyone knows what that means&hellip; riots, rampages, looting, and much, much more. If white children behaved like Muslims, throwing a fit when something doesn&rsquo;t go exactly their way, we&rsquo;d punish them, we&rsquo;d ground them, we&rsquo;d even spank them, but if we&rsquo;re decent parents, we won&rsquo;t let them get away with that type of behavior. Because we know it doesn&rsquo;t make for a civilized society, and you don&rsquo;t want your kids to grow up as jerks. Yet these same people who&rsquo;d punish their own children for behaving like that condone that behavior from Muslims. It&rsquo;s called the double standard.</p>

This is an absolute lie, if this were the truth Britain would be deporting those muslims who were demanding &#8220;beheadings&#8221; and &#8220;death&#8221; to the people who had the audacity to draw cartoons of Muhammed.</p>

			<p>Where can we all buy a copy of the DVD so we can exercise our freedom of speech and view the facts.   It is a crazy modern world where we can buy hard pornographic films, even watch them on public TV now, but cannot watch warnings about the future.  After all, much of the video is actal recordings of Imans, not actor, spreaching hate in mosques.   The time must be coming when we all in the West demand with our votes that the PC fools be consigned to the wilderness where they all belong.</p>

			<p>Britain has a Unitarian form of government.  It really is pretty totalitarian.  You have a crooked cartel of people in power and there is nothing they cannot do in terms of changing laws and rules.  Criminalizing speech, thought and political party affiliations.  I wish the people would realize this and do whatever it takes to get rid of the current crowd in power. </p>

			<p>What is especially shocking to me is that he had an invitation from the House of Lords!  He wasn&rsquo;t just coming in on his own to show his film in some squalid little movie theatre in the red light district.  </p>
<p>This surely reveals to us the power of the Moslem lobby in Britain. The British government, and even the royal family, live in terror of them.  The guests who were allowed into the house thirty years ago have taken over the house and the owners cower in fear.</p>

			<p>Britain does not fear him. The leadership class fears him. </p>
<p>They fear him because he speaks the truth. They also fear what the country&rsquo;s huge and rapidly burgeoning Muslim population might do, so they brand Mr Wilders as a &#8220;far-right extremist&#8221; - &#8220;extremism&#8221;, of course, is defined as anything opposed by the ruling class. The fact that the CIA has said that the UK is the single greatest threat to US security due to the huge and increasingly radicalised Pakistani colonist population has simply been ignored.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord&#8221; Ahmed, a Labour placeman in the so-called (and wholly unelected) &#8220;House of Lords&#8221; threatened to mobilise 10,000 Muslims if Mr Wilders was allowed to attend a screening of the film. THAT was an incitement to civil insurrection by his Muslim brothers if ever there was one. </p>
<p>In Britistan, the terrible face of our dhimmi future becomes more apparent with each passing day. There is nothing we can do about it, either. </p>
<p>We have no longer any right to freedom of speech. The real opposition party, the BNP, is tiny and handicapped by the country&rsquo;s electoral system. There is a constant barrage of anti-BNP propaganda in all forms of mass media. </p>
<p>The severity of the economic slump, which will likely become a depression in the UK at least, is bringing the globalist ambitions of the leadership class into sharp focus. They are deeply worried that the BNP are at last poised to make electoral headway. I expect every dirty &#8220;black ops&#8221; trick in the book to be used against them in the May 2009 local council and European Parliament elections and the general election, which must be held no later than May 2010 (the government gets to choose the timing). </p>
<p>Should the BNP start to do too well, they will be banned, just like Vlaams Blok were in Belgium. The liberal-left elites are doubtless working on plausible reasons to ban them even as I write.  </p>
<p>It is often said that when a political solution is made impossible then there must be a paramilitary solution. But not in Britistan, as the common people have been disarmed. </p>
<p>This country is finished. The people have stood by and done nothing as the country has been systematically gang-raped by the leadership class since WWII. Very shortly, we shall reap the whirlwind, as we descend into utter social and economic chaos, and suffer ever more repression by the cowards, charlatans and outright traitors who infest the corridors of power.</p>
<p>How can we fight back?</p>

			<p>Please sign the above petition to help Geert Wilders as 32,000 people already have as of noon today. In the UK the Lib/Lab/Con establishment parties are crumbling as their House of lies collapses due to the Internet. More and more people every day are awakening to their lies and the brainwashing no longer works, every single thing the New Labour government does turns to dust. This is no ordinary collapse of a disliked government, this a popular movement of people who have realised that the neo-Marxist British Establishment have been lying to them for decades and have used mass immigration to destroy their culture and traditions and the so-called free trade association, the Common Market, has now morphed into the EU Federal superstate (USSR Mark II) which was the plan all along to destroy European nation-states in this European plank of the One-World government agenda. </p>
<p>In the &#8221;British Jobs for British Workers&#8221; dispute the UK government, due to the EU law of free movement of labour throughout the EU, are helpless to stop British engineering contracts for refineries, power plants etc., being given to companies from outwith the UK and they are employing workers from other EU states, and in this climate of economic recession, British workers are remaining unemployed. This means that the EU nation-states are already redundant as the power lies with the EU. The EU chickens have come home to roost as the walkouts are organised by the ordinary workers who have bypassed the neo-Marxist triumvirate of (1) bosses of the trade unions, who are the financial backers of (2) the New Labour government who are wedded to (3) the neo-Marxist Establishment of the EU Federal superstate. </p>
<p>Nick Griffin, the BNP leader has already been taken to court (twice) by the totalitarian UK government in a trumped-up charge after stating that Islam was &#8216;a wicked and vicious faith&rsquo; but was found innocent by a jury. Geert Wilders is now the latest nationalist to be hung out to dry by the neo-Marxist EU/Muslim alliance but nothing they do fools the public as it used to and the short 16-min film &#8216;Fitna&rsquo; is being watched by the masses on the Internet and this story is big big news all over Europe. The neo-Marxists of the EU and the Dutch government have most definitely shot themselves in the foot. In short, they are demonising this man as &#8221;racist&#8221;, &#8221;right-wing&#8221; and the next Adolf Hitler but it is laughable and nobody believes their lies. The EU neo-Marxist liars are in total disarray with lots more to come.<br>

			<p>When simply speaking the truth, or what is a commonly held opinion becomes a crime you know that the government is one that is in defiance of human nature. A government in defiance of human nature must become increasingly authoritarian to maintain power.</p>
<p>Like administering a poison, the Western elite seem to know just the amount to keep the host from over reacting, just enough to kill him a little more</p>

			<p>Perhaps Mr. Wilders should enter the UK illegally and immediately apply for asylum. He would be safely in the country for years before his asylum was denied and his removal order could safely be ignored until he was joined by his wife and they could reapply later for asylum. It would be years later before they were both denied asylum and a removal order issued. When the enforcement authorities finally arrived and detained them, they could say they were traumatized and demand 150,000 pounds for their suffering.<br>

			<p>So Lord Ahmed can threaten to mobilize 10,000 muslims for the purposes of whatever they might do if mobilized and the same crooked underlings in government in Britain who saw to it that Geert Wilders not be allowed to enter into the UK do nothing.  There does not seem to be anyone to call the government on this sort of behavior either does there.  The media usually calls anyone with a pro traditional and patriotic stance who comes out against the literal social engineering schemes in respective western nations to destroy what was and reengineer what is to be but they certainly ignore this kind of suspicious government behavior with regards to Geert Wilders.  It ought to be a wake up call to a lot of people that the government does not have the majorities best interest at heart and that you have a gang of thugs running the government who are beholden only to a certain set of semi subversive special interests before their constituents.  I was never against some aspects of liberalization but the inevitable growth of ethnic identity politics with the growth of ethnic populations and so called &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221;  were simply too much. How do you British like &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221;  in these hard economic times?  How much do you like the politicians who push it?  Do something about it! </p>

			<p>This is the Great Britain so many good men died for in two wars? If only those Tommies going over the top had known what was to become of their country. Would they have even bothered? If Churchill and Hitler were to magically come back and spend a few days in London and Berlin respectively, it is Churchill who would feel more out of place. What did Britain really gain from its foolish wars with Germany?</p>

			<p>&#8220;What did Britain really gain from its foolish wars with Germany?&#8221;</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve started to wonder this too: So Britain fought two wars against Germany  &mdash;   a very closely related cultural cousin, Protestant Germanic, splendid in literature and the sciences and even ethnically almost identical (the Anglo-Saxons came from northern Germany)  &mdash;   for what?  So that England would have the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of becoming a pathetic PC state, perishing as a white nation just a few decades later?  </p>
<p>Whatever the debate on World War II, fighting World War I was just stupid and totally unnecessary, with England having nothing to gain from WWI but losing dearly  &mdash;   all England had to do was to just avoid WWI or exit it early.  Then, whatever happened on the Continent, Britain would have actually enhanced its position as Europe and the world&rsquo;s dominant power, gained a role as a neutral broker, founded a continental union, begun the major international institutions of the world, maintained its control over the seas and its centrality in international trade, even extended its power in East and Southeast Asia.  The Germans had no interest at all in invading or even causing minor damage to Britain  &mdash;   in fact, all the war plans of WWI were done expressly with an interest in not having Britain in the war at all, not even threatening Britain&rsquo;s colonial position.  And there was no neo-Bonaparte among the Central Powers to impose a broad rule, it was a dumb war fought over, in general, rather trivial matters.  Instead, England bled itself white at the Somme and Gallipoli, went into debt, and destroyed its own empire and confidence, draining its manpower away so much that it had to recruit overseas to rebuild  &mdash;   leading directly to its demise as a white nation today, which Enoch Powell saw long ago.  Even the conventional historians now agree that engaging like that in WWI (and dragging the USA into it) was a terrible, disastrous mistake for the British.  </p>
<p>Also, it was WWI after all, that made WWII possible and which created the Nazis and the fascist leaders (as well as the Bolshevik totalitarians in Russia) in the first place  &mdash;   a reaction to Versailles in Germany.  (And even then, the Nazis never got more than about 30% of the vote.)  A brief WWI with a Wilhelmine Peace would have probably been the single most conservative result for Europe, as the Central Powers didn&rsquo;t really want a lot more than a buffer zone in the east with Russia, and control over inter-European economic matters (which they wound up getting anyway!).  Most of all  &mdash;   by avoiding WWI or exiting it early, Britain would have gained tremendously, they&rsquo;d probably be ruling the world and the seas today.  Instead, they entered in 1914 against their German cousin and foolishly threw two centuries&rsquo; worth of imperial gains away, and in the process, delivered themselves a mortal wound that is killing Britain as a Western nation today.</p>

			<p>At the anonymous person who attacked me: </p>
<p>Firstly, Labour have been in power only sporadically. From 1951-1964 they were out of power, out of power again from 1971-1974 and again from 1979-1997. Hardly continuous power, is it?</p>
<p>Secondly, the Labour Party&rsquo;s ideological base has changed beyond recognition. As late as their 1983 manifesto, they had a quasi-Marxist (and, in some ways, almost nationalist) economic agenda with full nationalisation of strategic industries, unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Union (or EEC as it then was). </p>
<p>By 1997, they had undergone an ideological revolution, conforming entirely to the Bilderberg Group agenda - desrestricted laissez-faire economics, free-markets, borderless globalised capitalism, low tax for the wealthy, aggressive military intervention in foreign countries&rsquo; affairs (Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Serbia), embraced unrestricted mass immigration (immediately quadrupled) and, most strikingly, launched an all-out war on the indigenous culture.  </p>
<p>Thirdly, you should know that the UK&rsquo;s ramshackle UNWRITTEN constitution has permitted Labour&rsquo;s assaults on freedom, and the UK&rsquo;s antiquated electoral system tends to deliver govermnments with unassailable parliamentary majorities with only a minority of the actual vote. </p>
<p>So, my anonymous critic, next time you put your fingers to your keyboard, you might like to know what you are talking about first.</p>

			<p>Reply to the Fox: (Who took my post too personally)</p>
<p> Wasn&rsquo;t the British commonwealth citizenship act passed by a majority Labour government? Didn&rsquo;t the Empire Windrush arrive in 1948 while Labour was in power? Isn&rsquo;t it true that this all happened on Labour&rsquo;s watch? Wasn&rsquo;t it the Labour party that got the ball rolling? That started this whole mess for Britain? Didn&rsquo;t all this happen when Labour got its very first parliamentary majority? Didn&rsquo;t Labour fiercely oppose the immigration restriction acts of 1962? Didn&rsquo;t Labour play a key role in creating Britain&rsquo;s notorious and outrageous race and discrimination laws? Hasn&rsquo;t Labour just flooded Britain with foreigners since 1997? They won the last three elctions so somebody must be voting for them? What you have to realize is that it was Labour that started Britain down the road to its current multi-racial madness. Once you start these things they very quickly take on a life of their own and soon become almost unstoppable. By the late 50&rsquo;s or early 60&rsquo;s it was too late. Churchill reconized the dangers in the last yaers of his political life but was too old, tired and worn out to do anything about it. Most Britons were then clueless about the disaster that was unfolding ahead of them. Tell me this if you don&rsquo;t hold Labour responsible for the demise of White Britain then who do you hold responsible - the BNP?</p>

			<p>&#8220;What did Britain gain from its foolish wars with Germany&#8221;,,</p>
<p>Britain entered the Great War (known as WW1 after 1939) because of an obscure pledge to Belgium - in 1839(!) - and Belgium isn&rsquo;t even a real country. It entered WW2 because of an even crazier pledge to Poland, which had only been a country for 20 years, was only two-thirds Polish, contained 2,000,000 Germans and its territory bisected Germany. Yet hypocritically it didn&rsquo;t even do anything in 1939 or 1945 when the USSR annexed 100,000 square miles of Poland. Britain should have remained neutral in WW1 like Switzerland and Sweden. It would have been better off. The war or wars would have ended sooner and been less ruinous for Europe. Britain made a fatal mistake in 1906 when it decided to abandon the policy of &#8220;splendid isolation&#8221; and hook up with France and Russia. Just eight years later this ill-conceived decision (about which the British people knew nothing) would drag Britain into the worst war it ever fought after enjoying (general) peace since 1815. It was a very fatal mistake.</p>

<p>Since Fox is apparently exhonerating the Labour Party from blame(or full blame), I would like to know just who is the culprit behind this?  On whose shoulders DOES the guilt fall?</p>
