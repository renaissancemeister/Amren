<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Tardiness Sets Him Apart From Bush</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Clark, FOX News, February 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s a new time zone in the nation&rsquo;s capital: Obama Time.</p>
<p>Barely two weeks into his presidency, Barack Obama has made a clean break from George W. Bush in several high-profile moves, including reversing a number of the 43rd president&rsquo;s policies.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also reversed an unwritten but much-noticed Bush policy: Be on time, all the time.</p>
<p>Obama has been routinely late to events and news conferences, including the ones at which he reversed Bush&rsquo;s orders. This has led to an already familiar refrain from the Obama camp: &#8220;He&rsquo;s running late.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president was 45 minutes late Friday for a ceremony in which he introduced a team of outside economic advisers. He was 10 minutes late Thursday to a memo signing at the Energy Department. He was nearly 30 minutes late Wednesday for the ceremony at which he signed a bill to expand children&rsquo;s health care.</p>
<p>Even before the inauguration, Obama wasn&rsquo;t a punctual sort; he arrived late to a Jan. 8 news conference on the economy that was aired live by broadcast and cable networks.</p>
<p>When it comes to following the clock, Obama closely resembles Bill Clinton, who was famously late to events when he was president. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, being tardy, it&rsquo;s got to be one of two things,&#8221; said presidential historian Doug Wead, who advised both Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush. &#8220;Bad organization that can be corrected, or it&rsquo;s arrogance. It sounds to me like this is arrogance.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama was habitually late to events on the campaign trail and to meetings as a U.S. senator. In fact, there&rsquo;s a montage on YouTube of him offering apologies for missing testimony and presentations because of his late arrivals to meetings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He even apologized in advance for asking questions that might be repetitive.</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s tardiness already appears to have spread to others in his administration. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs has been routinely late for daily news briefings, sometimes by more than an hour.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>This White House is more like an episode of &#8220;The Goof Troop&#8221; than a cohesive group pursuing a common interest, which is fine by me considering what they want to do.  I always knew that people like Nancy Pelosi chose Obama over HRC in the primaries because Pelosi wanted to remain the most powerful woman in America, Queen Bee Syndrome and all that.  But another reason, as Rush speculated today, is that Obama is such an empty suit that Pelosi knew that she could roll him meaning she would be effectively running the country. </p>

			<p>Oprah has a problem being on time. Her protege Dr. Phil has claimed this also, that habitually being late is a sign of arrogance. It&rsquo;s quite possible, however, that this is instead sign of a deep seated personality problem. One that afflicts Barack Obama.  </p>

<p>How dare you racist whites expect him to conform to white standards! You wouldn&rsquo;t do this if McCain&hellip;</p>
<p><i>He&rsquo;s also reversed an unwritten but much-noticed Bush policy: Be on time, all the time.</i></p>
<p>And the Media Machine will compare <br>
Bush&rsquo;s &#8220;cold, strict, uncool desire to be on-time with Obama&rsquo;s hip, cool, trendy &#8220;laid-back&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>Bush had a lot of faults, but at least he was on-time I suppose</p>

<p>So this article is about comparing Republicans to Democrats as opposed to whites vs. blacks.  We all know blacks have atrocious tardiness records, but I am not sure if this article fully makes a case for us.  Of course it is from &#8220;Fox News&#8221; so what should we expect?  So is it true that Clinton had the same type of record, or is this article over emphasizing it?</p>

<p>Arrogance is a natural black trait that affects a very large percentage of the black population.  </p>
<p>Mark&hellip;my&hellip;.words.  As this man gets frustrated for not getting his way as time goes by look for other black traits to expose themselves, like trash talking anger, and many other black failings and inabilities will surface periodically as well.</p>
<p>As he gets more wrapped up in complications, his &#8220;cool&#8221; will be replaced with anger and impatience.</p>

			<p>Having lived in Africa for 24 years, it is common there amongst the black tribes-peoples for the last one to arrive at any meeting is thought to be the most imptortant so arrival times get later and later until at one important meeting held by the old Apartheid govt., with many black South African leaders attending, after many were over an hour late, the meeting was called off and the latecomers told later that they had been thought of as not attending and so they lost out on finacially benefitting from important decisions.</p>
<p>You have to know the people and this is something that many ignorant people in the West do not understand and in fact those in the West who think that the African black (as opposed to the African whites and Indians) generally thinks like us in the West are being very racist for assuming such foolishness.</p>
<p>I have already predicted that Pres. B.O. will prove to have feet-of-clay as the misplaced idolatry is shown to be just that, but we must wait and see.  I hope for the sake of the USA that I am wrong but sadly over the last 15 years my predictions on Africa, and the current credit crisis, based on experience (I am 71 years old), knowledge and logic have all proven to be correct as my recorded writings would show.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s arrogance!  Duh!  What else could it be?  Does Oprah do live TV?  I bet when or if she does, she&rsquo;s on time, because she has to be.  It&rsquo;s not like Oprah has more conscientious subordinates.</p>
<p>My point is, there are legions of white folks ensuring Oprah and Obama&rsquo;s success, and if Obama isn&rsquo;t on time, it&rsquo;s by choice.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s arrogance, Mr. Wead.  Black time is just another example of disrespect toward &#8220;THE MAN.&#8221;  And THE MAN no longer includes the President.</p>
<p>When the economy tanks (it&rsquo;s coming) and it&rsquo;s every man for himself (it might not be that bad for white folks), I wonder how may blacks will be late for the looting and arson?  None.  They&rsquo;re never late for freebies and they&rsquo;re always first when it comes to destruction.<br>

			<p>I fail to see the problem here. Obama is just operating on &#8220;black time&#8221;. This is part of his race and culture. To suggest that he should adhere to human rules of etiquette or protocol is just racist. </p>

			<p>Tardiness could also be attributed to not being able to &#8220;face the day&#8221; due to overstress, personal issues, mental issues, etc.  By being President, Obama has very likely bitten off more than he could chew.<br>

He doesn&rsquo;t like life in the fish bowl either. He went to Camp David this past weekend to &#8216;get away&rsquo;; no other reason was given.</p>
<p>This guy is going to burn out quickly under under watchful eye of the ever present media looking for a photo op or a quote.</p>
<p>I predict a public melt down with blacks calling for the harassment to end.</p>
<p>And if you listen to black talk radio, you&rsquo;ll aways hear an annoyed black host complaining his black guest is late because he runs on &#8216;black time&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>It just goes to show how shallow and immature this guy is, and always was.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a clown.</p>
<p>I worked for years with VIP&rsquo;s in NYC before I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, and one thing I noticed was the difference between the self-assurance (yes, sometimes arrogance) of the REALLY talented (mostly Musicians whose talent in my book was unquestionable, whether I liked their music or not) and those who were just Pop stars, and then their respective staffs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in most cases, the WORST were the wives of these people, or the big time Models - all of whom possessed NO appreciable talent, at all. Though they did seem to have a genius for making pests of themselves.</p>
<p>But this punk, he takes the cake. He&rsquo;s an arrogant nothing that his Enablers/Handlers have spoiled rotten, and it shows. <br>
In short, the source of his arrogance is not some talent that could benefit humanity, its the empty conceit of a man who is full of himself and who is incapable of knowing his limits, which are great, and even less capable of feeling any shame.</p>
<p>In other words - He&rsquo;s a clown. </p>

			<p>Oh, and another thing.</p>
<p>Earlier today I was talking to someone who asked me what I thought of Obama.  Long story short, I said that I would love to hear a story of how Putin or Mevedev put this guy in his place for pulling something like that on them.<br>
He is going to end up looking like such an amature&hellip;a child.<br>
They just do NOT know how to act. And I am convinced that the world is not going to behave like many White Americans who go through life with a &#8220;Kick Me&#8221; sign on their back.  </p>
<p>Heck, in our own country there are probably more people than we think who can stand this guy, and AR is an American institution, as in AMERICAN Renaissance.  So for sure Russia and China are probably going to look at his behavior as another reason to sign us off for good.</p>
<p>Besides - look at how this punk is acting while our country and economy and everything else circles the drain.  Read this article http://www.vdare.com/roberts/090208_fools.htm<br>
and then consider Obama&rsquo;s childish behavior and see if it doesn&rsquo;t make you sick to your stomach with disgust.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with many of the people posting here. Liberals tend not to be very good at punctuality. It&rsquo;s more a liberal trait than a black one. Tardiness is also a Latin European trait. When a friend of mine was going to school in France, she was always gently teased for her &#8220;anglo saxon&#8221;  attitudes about being on time. Italians and Spaniards also share this attitude. You&rsquo;d have to offer them a million dollars to be punctual. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bush had a lot of faults, but at least he was on-time, I suppose&#8221;   Posted by Obscuratus at 6:34PM on February 9</p>
<p>True I suppose, but when Bush got to the press conference on time, he arrived poorly prepared and used poor grammar. It&rsquo;s six of this and a half dozen of that.</p>

			<p>This is great news! Because the U.S. federal government has been on a nonstop mission over the last 50 years or more to destroy the founding people of the country, anything that slows down this fatal disease is welcome news. Way to go Obama! Why not go ahead and take a couple *years* off for vacation and do your part to help save the country? That &#8220;plan&#8221; certainly would have worked wonders for the Bush administration. Feel like a war? Just go bowling. Want to print more money? Take a cruise. Got the urge to increase Mexican mortgages? Just take a nap till sanity returns.</p>

			<p>My sister works as an engineer for one of the Big Three automakers.  They had an important meeting one day and the boss wanted them there on time.  Twenty minutes into the meeting, a black female walked in and sat down.  After the meeting the supervisor asked her why she was late.  She told him &#8221; it&rsquo;s a black thing, you would&rsquo;nt understand&#8221;.  It would have been nice if he had told her &#8221; you&rsquo;re fired, it&rsquo;s a white thing, you would&rsquo;nt understand&rsquo;.  As a police supervisor, I have seen black police officers constantly coming in late for their shift and have had to write them up.  </p>

			<p>Is it just me, or does it feel like this plane we are on is set to autopilot for the next four years (and the crew has jumped out the back some time ago) and we are left here in our seats looking at the screen which keeps showing us images of hot young athletes confessing to doing drugs, with the sound of the tiny bubbles of a bong playing to soothe us on our journey to God knows where!?</p>
<p>Cause, from where I&rsquo;m sitting it sounds about right&hellip;</p>
<p>And, that wistful looking black man who sounds like he is talking with marbles in his mouth, I don&rsquo;t care what he has to say at all&hellip;</p>
<p>Honestly, even I thought he would HAVE to drop the platitudes once he was elected. But here we are and what can we do about any of it?<br>

<p>The only reason he is President is because his &#8220;father&#8221; was black. </p>
<p>If Obama&rsquo;s father was white no one would know or care who he is. And I strongly suspect he would not have been accepted into Harvard. </p>

			<p>If Gibbs, the press secretary, is an hour late, I urge  reporters to get up and leave. They have jobs too. I&rsquo;d love to see that chubby little face if he walked into an empty room. As far as the President, are his flunkies too afraid to say, &#8220;Mr. President, it&rsquo;s the height of bad manner to keep others waiting?&#8221; They have jobs and lives too.&#8221; He seems to say no one is above reproach. Does that include him? Or is he above the ordinary &#8220;folks?&#8221;</p>

Honestly, Obama is constantly running late because his coaches and handlers are having to spend an inordinant amount of time prepping him for every appearance.  Sure, Bush had his handlers, but I&rsquo;m sure he brushed them off more often than not, as we saw from his faux pas at the podium.  Obama cares what his image is to a fault.  And despite all his prepping, he still screws up every time he opens his mouth.  He is a rank amateur, and everyone knows it.</p>

			<p>Ask yourself the following:</p>
<p>1) You have a court appearance. Would you show up late and risk alienating the judge and jury?</p>
<p>2) You are going for a job interview. Would you show up late and P***-off the potential employer? </p>
<p>3) You are going to meet your significant others&rsquo; family. Do you show up late and make a bad first impresison?</p>
<p>People only show up habitually late when they feel they are above it all and can treat others with disdain. Yes, IT&rsquo;S ARROGANCE.</p>

They didn&rsquo;t used to call it &#8220;CP Time&#8221; for nothin&rsquo;, ya know. </p>
<p>Arrogance? Quite possibly. But equally possible is that BHO   &mdash;   like the African side of his genetic makeup generally   &mdash;   has less regard for timeliness and punctuality than white people. Even poor and working-class people have respect for time   &mdash;   and consideration for others   &mdash;   than our new &#8220;black-identifying&#8221; Commander in Chief apparently has. </p>
<p>But this is just another manifestation of blacks&rsquo; lack-of-forethought problem, isn&rsquo;t it? If you&rsquo;re doing an adequate amount of thinking-ahead, you PLAN to ALLOW yourself enough time to get to a place at the time you said you&rsquo;d be there. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a disorganized, live-for-the-moment, &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; kind of person, however, you don&rsquo;t. You just wing it. You say things like, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll get there when I get there.&#8221; And, as a consequence, you&rsquo;re frequently LATE   &mdash;   to events both trivial and important. </p>
<p>Also, let&rsquo;s not forget those reports during the campaign that said O&rsquo;s plane was smelly and dirty and disorganized. Again: all part of the same problem   &mdash;   and all traceable to the same (racial) source.</p>

			<p>To Courtney, regarding:</p>
<p>&#8220;So is it true that Clinton had the same type of record, or is this article over emphasizing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the article was not exaggerating General Secretary Clinton&rsquo;s poor concept of time; remember, he was our &#8220;first black president,&#8221; after all. Comrade BO is an openly acknowledged mulatto and thus, must be held to even greater standards than the fully &#8220;black&#8221; Bill Clinton!</p>
<p>Oh, the multicultural madness never ends, particularly in the &#8220;rainbow&#8221; people&rsquo;s time  &mdash;  LOL!!!</p>

			<p>He grew up in Hawaii.  Hawiians and everyone else who has lived there for very long have always made jokes about being on Hawaiian time.  No one cares there and everyone is late as it is considered fashionable.  I am just amazed that this well known (at least to us on the West Coast) item about Hawaii never came up during the campaign.  </p>

			<p>I have to disagree with many of the people posting here. Liberals tend not to be very good at punctuality. It&rsquo;s more a liberal trait than a black one. Tardiness is also a Latin European trait. When a friend of mine was going to school in France, she was always gently teased for her &ldquo;anglo saxon&rdquo; attitudes about being on time. Italians and Spaniards also share this attitude. You&rsquo;d have to offer them a million dollars to be punctual.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the world as we know did&rsquo;nt come to an end? how European!</p>

<p>You are only looking at the facts you want to look at.  I would say Northern European whites as well as Northern Asians are the only punctual people in the world, so how can you totally eliminate that it IS NOT a black thing, just because this article is focusing on the Democrat vs. Republican issue?  You could also say that LIBERAL Northern Europeans have generated a culture that allows for tardiness more than those who lean right, but what do you expect from a political way of thinking that caters to third world people?</p>
<p>&#8220;True I suppose, but when Bush got to the press conference on time, he arrived poorly prepared and used poor grammar. It&rsquo;s six of this and a half dozen of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if Obama uses proper and intelligent grammar? I fully understand why most people on here don&rsquo;t like Bush.  I don&rsquo;t have too high of a viewpoint of him myself.  But I am really getting tired of people on here saying Bush is dumber than Obama. What evidence do you have for that, and what media outlet are you getting that nonsense from?  Bush may not be &#8220;smart&#8221; by white standards, but how in the world can anyone on here who is truly racially aware say that a black affirmative action product president is smarter than Bush?  Enough of this nonsense.</p>

			<p>His chief of staff or the event organizer could fix this.  Tell BHO that there will be a cover charge imposed at &#8220;the club&#8221; after the start time.  He&rsquo;ll be beating his feet like an Olympic sprinter to avoid any personal costs&hellip;.</p>
<p>Oh yeah - they&rsquo;re not &#8220;personal costs&#8221; anymore.  The taxpayer is picking up the tab&hellip;.</p>
