<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On February 2, 2009, NumbersUSA with the Coalition for the Future American Worker launched <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/resources/video/commercials/elevator-commercial.html?jid=83591&amp;lid=9&amp;rid=928&amp;tid=479680" target="elevator" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">the above [see below] &#8220;elevator ad&#8221;</a> in an extended nationwide educational campaign on cable TV.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ad is to inform the public of two government statistics that, when placed together, show an outrageous participation of our federal government in increasing the numbers of unemployed Americans.</p>
<p>The two statistics from last year?</p>
<p>* 2.5 million Americans lost jobs</p>
<p>* The federal government brought in 1.5 million new foreign workers to take jobs</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fact is that U.S. immigration policies are on automatic pilot. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how terrible the economy becomes  &mdash;  it doesn&rsquo;t matter that more than 11 million Americans are looking for a job and can&rsquo;t find one. No matter what, businesses can still seek to cut their labor costs by bringing in as many foreign workers as they did when the economy was booming.</p>
<p>The feds will keep cranking out 138,000 new work permits and green cards EACH MONTH to working-age foreign adults unless Congress and the President decide to change current policies so that they serve the interests of American workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barbara Jordan [chairman of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform] found that even during healthy economic times, our level of foreign labor importation was significantly harming the most vulnerable members of our national community. In near-depression times, the effect is devastating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elevator Ad&#8221; Script</p>
<p>Another American has lost his job.</p>
<p>Another breadwinner going home with the bad news.</p>
<p>Last year, two and a half million Americans lost jobs.</p>
<p>High-tech, construction and auto workers; engineers.</p>
<p>Yet, with millions of Americans jobless, our government is still bringing in a million and a half foreign workers a year to take American jobs.</p>
<p>Could your job be next?</p>

<p>But not as lazy as the workers I saw while living in Europe and traveling in the Islamic world.  Americans have statistically been putting in more hours than anyone in the world and increasingly falling behind financially for years.  Now that third world countries, including China no longer have Americans to buy their worthless junk, they are going back to their fallow farms - 20 million in China just today.  If America falls the rest of the world falls too as we are seeing now - don&rsquo;t be so smug.  The rest of the world has been leaning on the U.S. since WW2 and never more than now.</p>

			<p>Amazing they get it coming and going - they claim to be globalist corporations with a global world view but then ask Uncle Sam for bailout money. At the same time they are swindling the American taxpayer they bring in foreign workers to put him out of work. Such blind, hypocritical greed is mind blowing.</p>

<p>You are correct. A black president cannot save anybody. Fortunately, the US does not need saving.</p>

			<p>Excuse me, Mr./Ms. Anonymous. From what statistics are you quoting? I remember hearing somewhere that within recent years Americans worked more overtime compared to any other developed nation. It ceases to amaze me that (white) American workers are considered lazier than their cousins in nanny-state Western Europe, who without a doubt must have the most pampered and lazy populace within the First World nations. <br>
We may agree on one point though, (white) Americans will not accept slave wages or harmful working conditions, nor are they willing to see their environment and physical health destroyed for the sake of corporate profits.<br>
We have dealt with those things before, and at some point you and your ideological brethren will run out of globalist plantations to rape and ruin. Asia&rsquo;s industry is already destroying the health and environment of it&rsquo;s populace. Your days are numbered, Anonymous.      </p>

			<p>Let my guess Anonymous - Indian PhD super genius computer programmer?   No matter, you are taking on the part of the anti-American foreigner so you get the bullseye on your back.  It is so funny how foreigners gloat over their &#8220;superiority&#8221; to the stupid, lazy American.  What they don&rsquo;t realize is that capital is hiring them because they are dumb enough to work for a fraction of the real value of the work.  Oh well, things come full circle.  The cost of labor is going up in India and combined with the lingering quality issues of the product coming back many companies are beginning to rethink offshoring.  Gloat while you can Anonymous.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m an American worker.  I work 50 - 60 hour weeks.  I&rsquo;m smart, fast and use technology to problem-solve and maximize production.<br>
We care about quality and our workmanship standards are high.<br>
My co-workers and I can compete w/ anyone.<br>
And, let me tell you, I&rsquo;ve no union and our pay and benefits are slipping fast. For instance, a married man with a family in my shop pays over $240 a week for lousy health insurance.<br>
The problem isn&rsquo;t the workers.  The problem is the essentially raceless and international capitalists who import cheap labor, move work offshore and/or import Chinese junk to enrich themselves at the expense of Americans. Their partners in crime are the sell-out senators and congress whores of both parties who enable this through legislation and backdoor deals.<br>

			<p>Anonymous&rsquo; post above is at best a PARTIAL truth. Yes, many workers are lazy, do demand top salary while seeing nothing wrong with underperforming. But still that hardly decribes ALL American workers with accuracy. Even Union Workers are not all like that.</p>
<p>The truth is not that Americans won&rsquo;t work; but that immigrant workers will gladly accept wages the average American cannot AFFORD to work for! After all, we can&rsquo;t count on welfare supplements, food stamps, free health care&hellip; unlike the illegal Hispanic immigrants flooding our nation. NPR Radio aired a story two years back, about how the Silicon Valley computer and software corporations FIRED American engineers en-masse, replacing them with cheap working Pakistani and Indian engineers fresh off the planes.</p>
<p>Americans WILL work. Something proven so many times over it hardly requires defending that statement. But we also are used to and require a higher standard of living. Which explains the need for a fair wage. Would YOU pick veggies all day, mop floors and wipe toilets and urinals at minimal (or even sub-minimal) wage, if you could instead qualify for a higher paying office, manufacturing or middle-management job? Anonymous needs to look at the whole picture, not just one unsavory aspect of a comparatively small number of American workers.</p>

<p>The truth is that foreign workers work cheaper.</p>
<p>Would any of you hire an American to put up sheet rock for $40 an hour, when Pedro can do just as good a job for $15 (or less) an hour?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>When union dock workers, in America, make as much as doctors, something is wrong. </p>
<p>A market correction is long overdue.</p>
<p>The danger is that Obama and the democrats are interfering with the self-correcting processes of the market.</p>

			<p>I saw this video. The usual numbersusa liberal even handedness. Include an equal number of blacks in the video&hellip;even though blacks just imposed an anti-white open borders Kenyan bigot on White America.</p>
<p>The larger issue is the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans. OUR enemy is making the case that the economic health of America requires an immigration policy that will reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America  over time. This is the big lie that must be exposed. Numbersusa and Roy Beck will never expose this big lie for PC reasons. It is really disgusting at this point in time. Probability that Roy Beck will come to the defense of John Tanton:0</p>

			<p>To Ivan(AM)</p>
<p>You can always count on a Libertarian to make a argument for wage slavery and slavery. Libertarians shouldn&rsquo;t be shocked that they are a very minor party in America.</p>
<p>The dry wall workers in California are an intertsting case. Union officials made the exact same argument as Ivan. They claimed that the White dry wall workers made to much therfore Mexcians who would work for less should be imnported. The Mexicans were imported. The White workers were diven out of the dry wall occupation.  California is now severely bankrupt;California is now a Democratic State;California is now a non-white state fast becomming an extension of Mexico;California is experinceing a severe water shortage-worst in 500 hndred years!!!!!!!   And&hellip;California&rsquo;s wildlife is highly threatened by its exploding high fertility hispanic,asian and muslim post-1965 population. These are the blessings of Ivan&rsquo;s market corrections.</p>
<p>The pursuit of cheap immigrant labor has brought about the destruction of California. Republican-Democratic cheap labor policies will result in the complete racial and economic dispossession of Native Born White American.</p>
<p>Unlike Republican and Democratic politicians, the crude Libertarians are very open about the fact that a high wage labor policy only applies to Bill Gates and the immigration lawyers. For the majority of Native Born White Americans, it will be a very low wage labor policy.</p>

			<p>The Federal Government is the single largest affirmative action employer in the USA.  </p>
<p>The government can run up massive budget deficits, and print money at will, and so it will only get larger as the economy continues to decline.  </p>
<p>If the illegal aliens are given amnesty, the problems of Americans losing jobs, prosperity and prestige to non-whites and foreigners will only get more pronounced.</p>
<p>If we really want to change things in America, we have to file lawsuits to eliminate affirmative action hiring by the Federal Government.</p>

			<p>To the many people who bought houses built by Mexican immigrant labor the last twenty-five years&hellip; far too many really are cheaply, shoddily built. As the owners find out to their eventual dismay. But just call this a side-benefit of saving money on all that &#8220;cheap labor&#8221;&hellip; savings which I&rsquo;m confident the builders passed on to the buyer.</p>

			<p>The reason immigration is kept at these levels is because the levers of power are in the hands of those who sell food, diapers, clothing, electricity, and housewares, and those who collect rents, speculate on land, and handle the loans and financial transactions.</p>
<p>Growth in population means growth for their bank accounts and asset portfolios. This country is being given away to foreigners, for the financial gain of a few.</p>

			<p>Al in AR hasn&rsquo;t seen the quality of work performed by latin immigrants if he is really claiming &#8220;Pedro&#8221; will do just as good a job for less than half the price. For instance, K&B; Homes in CA is buried in lawsuits the last decade. Why? Because of their reliance on illegal and latino workers. The houses are falling apart, the shoddy workmanship is a sight to behold, the cutting corners mirrors business practices in Mexico and parts of the Middle East where you&rsquo;ll see roofs cave in from light rain or floors collapse during parties because they can&rsquo;t handle the weight of more than 3 people. </p>
<p>I can tell you in IT the H1B Indians are generally horrible. Their coding skills are elementary and when you go in to clean things up you get the impression a lot of others have - the Indians and others would use a hammer to try and stop an ant invasion. </p>

If I had to count on any group for defense, shelter, food, education, or tech/medical care it is still white American..  or is this why everyone else other races/ethnics/power mongers comes to USA to take what we have built.   Get a grip; USA removed of government encumbrances (discrimination, human rights laws,etc), can hold their own anytime!

			<p>To Jupiter, Al, et al:</p>
<p>There is no excuse for anyone hiring a craftsman who is incompetent. I mean, there are such a things as standards,references,  rational choice, and free will.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for anyone hiring a craftsman who is an illegal alien. I do not hire them, or use them. I am firmly opposed to illegals sponging off our system, and the disgusting politicians, including the previous Moron, who let this happen. But the market correcting itself, in the Austrain economic sense, has nothing to do with illegals. It has only to do with skilled craftsmen who are willing to do just as good or better work than unions. UNIONS HAVE RUINED THIS COUNTRY, not Ricardo or Pedro, or, for that matter, Gustoff or Junghans. Also, WHITE PEOPLE HAVE RUINED THIS COUNTRY BY NOT REPRODUCING, getting their jollies, fiddling about.  </p>
<p>There is no excuse for dock workers making as much as doctors.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for me to pay a union laborer, of any race or nationality, $40 an hour to put up sheetrock, $120 an hour to put in the plumbing, $140 an hour to run the wiring, etc. </p>
<p>I can find skilled craftsmen who are not union who will do the job, and do it well.  Then, the money I save is spent or invested by me, my wife, or my children (stimulating the economy)  &mdash;  so what&rsquo;s the problem? </p>
<p>These things take some effort, but what worthwhile endeavor doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>But maybe that is what it takes to prosper in a free-market?</p>

			<p>A world of truth in that comment above, by a reader linking SUPPORT of immigration to profits on rent, sales of consumer items, etc. It nearly always are the people making money, fat profits off immigrants screaming the loudest about having to share, having to be charitable, having to &#8216;help&rsquo; people in poorer nations come here for a better life. (Local Houston used car dealers would go under, but for the hundreds of thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants buying their shoddy cars, trucks and SUVs that no rational White man would buy, after test driving them a block or two.)</p>
<p>Those many Americans having first-hand experience LIVING among or even near immigrants (regardless of nationality) are against immigration&hellip; is because of their alien lifestyle and alien mentality. The stench of their cooking (Somalis), the slovenly habits of illegal Mexicans, urinating in the yard (isn&rsquo;t that why so many homes have front, side and back yards?). The trashing of the neighborhoods where the immigrant foreigners move to. The noise and disruption of a decent life for their American neighbors.</p>

<p>The curent meltdown of the American economy and possibly world economy is a powerfull indictment of the Australian-Ayn Randian-extreme free market economics. In fact,unregulated capitailsm was discreted with the onset of the Great Depression. The vast majority of Americans and human beings in general find it to be repellent and evil.</p>
<p>Unions were and are a response to the a brutal economic system that was imposed on them by the likes of Carniege-Frick and other sociopatheic Robber Baron Capitalists.</p>
<p>You are just parroting lies and complete nonsense from the Cato institute and Fox News.</p>
<p>It is because of Unions that American workers were able to have a eight hour work day and that this nation is free of child labor. The greedy rich and the psychopathic CEOs have been fighting back relentlessly for years. And the weapons that they have been using agianst American White workers has been foreign scab labor and right to work laws in the American Southern states.</p>
<p>What is fundamentally absurd about your &#8220;argument&#8221; is that the real wage has been stagnant and then declining since 1973!!!! </p>
<p>Native Born White American workers-the male ones in particular- need to earn enough money to support a wife and children. If the open-borders Libertarians deny Native Born White Males this opportunity, the Native Born White population will collapse. This  happened in Russian recently.What you and other Libertarians are advocating is a low wage economy for White American males.</p>
<p>The cost of living is going up for Native Born White families because of the cost of both LEGAl and illegal immigration. To be more specific, it is the interaction of post-1965 immigration policy and the scarce resources of the US that is pushing up the cost of living. Now toss in millions of high fetility post-1965 non-whites and there is extreme downward pressure on wages. So naturally, there is going to a demand for higher wages on the part of Native Born White workers. </p>
<p>Go back to WW2 and the period up to 1973- the year that wages declined for unskilled workers and the year that the real wage began to stagnate for White Workers in general. Unions were growing in strength and in membership-and they were largely white- and the real wage was increasing. The size of the middle class expanded enormously. America was a much more equal society-economically&hellip;.AND LEGAL IMMIGRATION was very low. This fact completely refutes the Libertarian-Austrian school claims about the blessings of globalizing US labor markets  through immported scab labor,anti-protectionist laws and outsourcing.</p>
<p>On a more fundamental level, what you are advocating-maintaining high levels of legal immigration-will result in the racial dispossession of Native Born White Americans street by street,state by state and the country as a whole. This fact alone requires a complete rejection of you what are advocating. I prefer a California State University  system that is largely Native Born White. The labor policy that you advocate has been in practice since 1965. And it has resulted in Native Born White Americans becoming a racial minority in two of the largest staes in the Union. It is the low wage strategy of the Republican-Democratic and Libertarian parties that is rapidly bringing about the complete racial dospossesson of Native Born White Americans withn the borders of America.</p>

<p>Had I been around during the &#8220;robber baron&#8221; era, I would have joined or organized a union. That is what freedom offers. </p>
<p>But that time has passed. All things are constantly changing, and unions have had too much power, for far too long.</p>
<p>Their tactics have also been immoral. They have literally ruined many companies, with their greedy demands, and refusal to even consider the management&rsquo;s point of view. </p>
<p>They must adapt, or die. Time waits for no man.</p>
<p>Many people would have you believe that the current economic crisis is an indictment of capitalism. They have created this crisis by their meddling, then they point to the thing which they themselves have ruined, and talk about how it is broken and needs to be fixed, by them, of course!</p>
<p>And I never have been an advocate of the immigration act of 1965. </p>
<p>Politicians are like unions  &mdash;  imposing on the people things that they do not want, and shaking-down the middle-class. They have far too much power, and their tactics are immoral.</p>

<p>Unions didn&rsquo;t ruin any companies. The big Auto companies werent&rsquo; runed by high wage union workers. They were ruined by stupid corprate CEOs who made the decision to buid and sell gas guzzling SUVs.</p>
<p>Greed is seen as a very high moral virtue by Libertarians. This is the morality of Hell itself. Sometimes I think Libertarianism is the poltical equivalent of Aspergers syndrome.</p>

Years ago, I had a friend who worked on the NY docks. Well, a job indirectly associated with that. He made incredible money for the very ordinary work he did. That company folded and those jobs are all long gone now. In fact, the whole NY/Brooklyn waterfront, once very busy, is now closed with the shipping having moved to Baltimore and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Those were wonderful, fabulous, jobs, pay-wise, while they lasted. But they didn&rsquo;t last.  In their greed, they priced themselves right out of the market.</p>

			<p>With all due respect, Jupiter, if you want to talk about greed, talk about unions.</p>
<p>Unions are the political equivalent of leukemia  &mdash;  they used to be good, but they got out of control, and eventually destroy the very body that gave it life.</p>
<p>SOME CEOs are greedy too, I&rsquo;ll grant you that.</p>
<p>They are the political equivalent of an egomaniacal, narcissistic personality disorder.</p>
<p>A pox on both their houses  &mdash;  greedy unions and egocentric CEOs. </p>
<p>Immoral people are a blot on the free-market.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t consider greed a &#8220;virtue.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet your spelling teacher was a member of a teachers&rsquo; union.  </p>
