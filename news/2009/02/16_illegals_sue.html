<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/09/16-illegals-sue-arizona-rancher/">16 Illegals Sue Arizona Rancher</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Arizona man who has waged a 10-year campaign to stop a flood of illegal immigrants from crossing his property is being sued by 16 Mexican nationals who accuse him of conspiring to violate their civil rights when he stopped them at gunpoint on his ranch on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Roger Barnett, 64, began rounding up illegal immigrants in 1998 and turning them over to the U.S. Border Patrol, he said, after they destroyed his property, killed his calves and broke into his home.</p>
<p>His Cross Rail Ranch near Douglas, Ariz., is known by federal and county law enforcement authorities as &#8220;the avenue of choice&#8221; for immigrants seeking to enter the United States illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit is based on a March 7, 2004, incident in a dry wash on the 22,000-acre ranch, when he approached a group of illegal immigrants while carrying a gun and accompanied by a large dog.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the immigrants  &mdash;  five women and 11 men who were trying to cross illegally into the United States  &mdash;  have accused Mr. Barnett of holding the group captive at gunpoint, threatening to turn his dog loose on them and saying he would shoot anyone who tried to escape.</p>
<p>The immigrants are represented at trial by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), which also charged that Sheriff Dever did nothing to prevent Mr. Barnett from holding their clients at &#8220;gunpoint, yelling obscenities at them and kicking one of the women.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Barnett told The Washington Times in a 2002 interview that he began rounding up illegal immigrants after they started to vandalize his property, northeast of Douglas along Arizona Highway 80. He said the immigrants tore up water pumps, killed calves, destroyed fences and gates, stole trucks and broke into his home.</p>
<p>Some of his cattle died from ingesting the plastic bottles left behind by the immigrants, he said, adding that he installed a faucet on an 8,000-gallon water tank so the immigrants would stop damaging the tank to get water.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnett said some of the ranch´s established immigrant trails were littered with trash 10 inches deep, including human waste, used toilet paper, soiled diapers, cigarette packs, clothes, backpacks, empty 1-gallon water bottles, chewing-gum wrappers and aluminum foil  &mdash;  which supposedly is used to pack the drugs the immigrant smugglers give their &#8220;clients&#8221; to keep them running.</p>
<p>He said he carried a pistol during his searches for the immigrants and had a rifle in his truck &#8220;for protection&#8221; against immigrant and drug smugglers, who often are armed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His sprawling ranch became an illegal-immigration highway when the Border Patrol diverted its attention to several border towns in an effort to take control of the established ports of entry. That effort moved the illegal immigrants to the remote areas of the border, including the Cross Rail Ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my land. I´m the victim here,&#8221; Mr. Barnett said. &#8220;When someone´s home and loved ones are in jeopardy and the government seemingly can´t do anything about it, I feel justified in taking matters into my own hands. And I always watch my back.&#8221;<br>

			<p>MALDEF LARAZA means Ford Foundations tens of billion dollars against this rancher.  It&rsquo;s probably another Ramos Compean set up by the feds and the tax payer funded anti white non profits.</p>
<p>Expect to see both the rancher and the sheriff imprisoned for violating the illegals civil rights.</p>
<p>This will be a signal that any one who tries to protect himself, his or her family or property from illegal invaders will go to prison, just as the Ramos Compean case was a signal to Border Patrol officers that any attempt to enforce the law and protect our borders from mexican criminals would result in imprisonment.</p>
<p>The case will end up with the local Sheriff&rsquo;s and Police departments under federal court orders and DOJ monitoring to facilitate the movement of illegals and severely punish any American citizens who try to stop the home invasions, thefts, robberies and destruction of fences and other property.</p>

<p>What &#8220;civil rights&#8221;? The &#8220;civil right&#8221; of continuing to commit a <b>crime</b> (illegal immigration <i>is</i> still <b>illegal</b>- you haven&rsquo;t won yet!) ?</p>
<p>As the decline of the white majority of the U.S. accelerates, expect whites to be further prosecuted by insane, and expanding, definitions of what is a &#8220;civil right&#8221; (to non-whites/Muslims anyway):<br>
<i>White male that injured a &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; attempting to mug you?</i> You are violating the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of Juan Rodriguez.<br>
<i>White Christian that refused to convert and join the local mosque?</i> You are violating the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of Akbar al-Ankara. <i>White girl that refused to date a black male?</i> You are violating the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of D&rsquo;trell Lawayne Johnson.</p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m insane? <i>How many decades ago</i> would these &#8220;Mexican nationals&#8221; simply be arrested and deported?</p>

			<p>The individuals bringing suit against Mr. Barnett are nothing more than law breaking parasites.  I am no lawyer, but IMHO they should have NO RIGHT to bring suit for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) they were breaking the laws of the U.S. by entering our country illegally,<br>
2) they were trespassing on private property,<br>
3) given these non citizens were in the act of breaking the law while this occurred, they should be barred from using the US court system.  All criminal non-citizens should not be able to avail themselves of the U.S. courts.<br>
4)  their actions were the proximate cause in bringing about their purported &#8220;injuries&#8221;.</p>
<p>If MALDEF succeeds in this case, woe be unto the citizens of the U.S., as this will be the final nail in the coffin for anyone supporting an end to illegal immigration.  </p>

			<p>Like most illegals, these Mexicans are probably illiterate, so they are obviously being represented by semi-literate lawyers. The rancher violated their &#8220;civil rights.&#8221; How so? Their culture doesn&rsquo;t even have a history of rights; the rancher comes from a 1000 year old British tradition of private property. The lawyers or their parents were probably &#8220;naturalized&#8221; during a previous amnesty and should themselves be deported to the Aztec, human-sacrificing culture they are part of</p>

			<p>Apparently he has managed to capture and turn over to the Border Patrol 12,000 illegals in the last 10 years.  I think the pro illegal groups have been watching him for some time.</p>
<p>This is another Ramos Compean set up.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would almost be comedic in its audacity if it weren&rsquo;t so contrary to all that America stands for. 16 felonious, lawbreaking, illegal immigrants are suing an Arizona rancher who has captured 12,000 trespassing illegal immigrants on his property over the last decade. The illegals seek $32 million for &#8220;conspiring to violate their civil rights when he stopped them at gunpoint on his ranch on the U.S.-Mexico border.&#8221; Roger Barnett, 64, began rounding up illegal immigrants in 1998 and turning them over to the U.S. Border Patrol&#8221;</p>

			<p>What has the Border Patrol been doing while this man captured 12,000 illegals.</p>
<p>It would appear that a more or less permanent post should be established on this man&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>I suppose since the two Border Patrol agents were sent to jail they just sit in their cars and collect paychecks.</p>
<p>It takes a slimy tort lawyer to even accept a case like this one. It should be thrown out Post haste.<br>

			<p>For more information on these unspeakable anti white racists </p>
<p>MALDEF (financial and developmental help from the Ford foundation)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ford Foundation has spent many millions to promote racial agitation and possible civil war in America, completely polarizing the races. In this effort, it is simply carrying on the plan inaugurated by the Rothschilds in 1865 with the Peabody Fund, the Slater Fund, and later the General Education Board, which is now the Rockefeller Foundation. It takes money to promote a civil war. Ford Foundation entered the Hispanic field by giving $600,000 to the openly revolutionary Southwest Council of La Raza in 1968, and an additional $545,717 in 1969. Congressman Henry Gonzalez, himself a Hispanic, denounced La Raza as fomenting &ldquo;blind, stupid hatred.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Who is backing them? The rancher should counter-sue for expenses.)))<br>
Surely there&rsquo; a way he can sue for what are called &#8220;intentional torts&#8221;  &mdash;  which are really crimes instead of torts, at least to the non-lawyer&rsquo;s way of understanding.</p>
<p>Trespassing is a crime, but it is also a tort. As is destruction of property and probably another dozen complaints. You may not be able to get your local LE to prosecute for a crime like trespass, but you can sue the trespassers.</p>
<p>You can also sue for conspiracy to aid in trespass. </p>

			<p>I have followed the story of, rancher, Roger Barnett,for a couple of years now. As time has passed it has become increasingly clear to me that MALDEF, a so-called Mexican American legal defense organization, is nothing more than an arm of the Mexican government, that facilitates the invasion of the U.S. by illegal alien Mexican foreign nationals. They have full representation by fifth columnist MALDEF, while American citizen Roger Barnett, has none, from his own Congress, or American legal system. So the question is, who has more rights in the U.S., a guy protecting his own land, or foreign nationals that have over run his ranch for years, and damaged his property and stolen some of it?  As one web site warned concerning this story and the illegal alien invasion from Mexico,,&#8221; Ask not for whom the bell tolls  &mdash;  it tolls for thee.</p>

			<p>Mr. Barnett had probable cause to execute a citizens arrest of these people.  Citizens arrest has long been legal in this country.  If not, I didn&rsquo;t get the memo saying otherwise.</p>
<p>Under Texas State law, a rancher or cattleman or landowner CAN SHOOT YOU DEAD merely for being on his land without permission.  Where did I learn that?  Texas Police Academy years ago.  Perfectly lawful and legal.</p>
<p>You arrest someone via citizens arrest, but if you move them from that location, that may be considered to be kidnapping.  I see Barnett awaited the arrival of Sheriff/Border Patrol.</p>
<p>Maybe P are alleging that illegal entry is a misdemeanor and not a felony.  And that a citizens arrest is limited to felonies only.  If so, they want to change English Common Law which is well settled.</p>
<p>22,000 acres is equal to 34.375 square miles.  Big place&hellip;</p>
<p>I can see that MALDEF wants to win a big one, force Barnett to sell the Cross Rail Ranch to pay a judgment, take ownership of the ranch if he can&rsquo;t pay.  Then MALDEF - through the illegals - will own the ranch forever, and just let all of Mexico cross over the ranch land into the USA unopposed.  I expect the D to lose, but will they win on appeal?</p>

			<p>Here is a similar story.<br>
http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=597</p>
<p>First, federal law does not allow citizens&rsquo; arrests in cases dealing with the transport of undocumented immigrants. The relevant federal provision specifies that &#8220;no officer or person shall have authority to make any arrests&#8221; pursuant to the statute, other than officers and employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and &#8220;all other officers whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws.&#8221; [See 8 U.S.C. section 1324 (3)(B)(c).] Haab was neither an INS &#8220;officer&#8221; nor an &#8220;officer&#8221; with any other law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>Second, under section 8 U.S.C. section 1324, an undocumented person cannot be prosecuted for conspiring to transport him- or herself within the United States; only the person who is responsible for the transportation   &mdash;   the coyote   &mdash;   can be charged with a felony. [See Campbell v. U.S., 47 F.2d 70, 71-72 (5th Cir. 1931); Emmanuel v. U.S., 24 F.2d 905, 906 (5th Cir. 1928).] Because the men Haab detained were not violating federal law, he had no grounds to &#8220;arrest&#8221; them.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Thomas has already signaled that he&rsquo;ll take an expansive view of a new Arizona statute. The Arizona legislature recently enacted a state law that makes it a felony to &#8220;intentionally engage in the smuggling of human beings for profit.&#8221; Thomas interprets the statute to authorize the prosecution of immigrants who agree to be transported as conspirators, ignoring the fact that federal law comes to the opposite conclusion. [See A.R.S. section 13-2319; Maricopa County Attorney News Release, Opinion # 2005-002.] Although Haab cannot invoke section 13-2319 to legitimize his conduct because the statute did not go into effect until August 2005, other citizens may use it to justify detaining individuals they suspect are undocumented immigrants. </p>
<p>My guess is he will loose his ranch. Either to the illegals or he will have to sell it to pay his legal fees if he does win.<br>
Either way, it&rsquo;s a sad day for America. <br>

			<p>Has our Constitution been rescinded? Have we legislated the right of controlling usage of one&rsquo;s property away from the property owner? Do criminal illegal aliens now have the Constitutional right to tell a rancher they may legally TRESPASS on his land, whether the owner approves or not?</p>
<p>We need to get a class-action suit AGAINST MALDEF. For advocating and supporting deliberate tresspassing on private property! For aiding and abetting illegal immigration! For the crimes and problems, not to mention the wasted tax dollars illegal immigrants are responsible for.</p>

As an American, I am tired of our greedy politicians caving in to the special interest groups. While our working middle-class American people PAY THE PRICE!

<p>To think that a bunch of illegal invaders would have &#8220;civil rights&#8221; over and above those of an American citizen (ex-Sheriff) protecting his home, his family and his land?</p>
<p>This whole Mexican invasion thing is getting so out of control, that more and more utter insanity such as this will only continue and get worse&hellip;</p>
<p>It is time to STOP this never-ending Mexican invasion!  How about some of that so-called $1 trillion &#8220;economic stimulus&#8221; bill going towards the completion of the border fence?  Heck!  If we can afford a whole new Department of Homeland Security Headquarters, then we can certainly afford to complete the fence!<br>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s urge MALDEF and LA RAZA to go argue the &#8220;rights&#8221; of illegal aliens in their own countries. This is the biggest insanity of all. Should we go to France and ask that they give Americans rights they do not deserve? After all, we roll out the red carpet for illegals. Their own countries treat them so badly, they think they have a better chance here. So, you anti-American organizations&hellip;head south where is really counts!</p>

			<p>Citizens of another country do not have American civil rights. These lawyers and judges need to check their lawbooks again. Civil rights of any country are accrued only to the legal citizens of that country. Illegals are only entitled to human rights, and their human rights weren&rsquo;t violated even if the &#8216;big, bad doggies&rsquo; scared some of them. Poor babies. They shouldn&rsquo;t have been committing the crimes of breaking and entering the (supposedly) sovreign Republic of the United States, and trespassing on the private property of a United States citizen. Deport them. Naturally this will only give them the oppurtunity to turn around and try again, but it&rsquo;s all we have at the moment. </p>

			<p>Every now and then something happens that signals a defining moment in a nation&rsquo;s history. Nothing shows the decline of America more clearly then this story. It reminds me of the British PM in an area of London who was told to &#8220;get out&#8221; of the muslim area! Imagine that in Churchill&rsquo;s time! Imagine this in Eisenhower&rsquo;s time! Once a nation loses it&rsquo;s ethnic and racial consciousness and confidence its all over.</p>

			<p>The mere fact that the U.S. court would entertain a lawsuit on behalf of bunch of illegals, based on an argument that their so-called &#8220;constitutional rights&#8221; were violated is an outrage that calls for impeachment of the judges that allow for that.</p>
<p>Following that flawed &#8220;logic&#8221;, an invading army may warn us not to defend ourselves against the invasion or else we will violate our own constitution, which would allow them to use our federal justice system to imprison us for any meaningful resistance to their invasion.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a thorough argument that proves unconstutionality of such nonsense:</p>

			<p>&#8220;An Arizona man who has waged a 10-year campaign to stop a flood of illegal immigrants from crossing his property is being sued by 16 Mexican nationals who accuse him of conspiring to violate their civil rights when he stopped them at gunpoint on his ranch on the U.S.-Mexico border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds exactly like the first step of what happened to disposessed white farmers in Zimbabwe. One day not far off, illegals will sue to own the farm itself.</p>
<p>What do honest citizens do when they are systematically betrayed by both government and the courts?</p>
<p>Washington, Adams, and Jefferson knew&hellip;. </p>

			<p>I hope this story inspires volunteers to help patrol this man´s property.  It sounds like more manpower would make a difference. </p>

The individuals bringing suit against Mr. Barnett are nothing more thadsn law breaking parasites. I am no lawyer, but IMHO they should have NO RIGHT to bring suit for the following reasons:<br>

<p>Those of you who have never been sued for anything substantial have zero idea what is going on.</p>
<p>White lawyers, white judges and a white jury of retards will strip Mr. Barret of everything he owns.  </p>

			<p>This story came up on &#8220;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&#8221; last night.He was discussing the matter with two white women, who were supposedly legal experts. They all agreed that there was&rsquo;nt much of a case for the mexicans in as far as there cival rights being violated. But then one of the women asserted that Mr. Parsons was allegedly a &#8220;racist&#8221;, which might then give the mexicans some sort of a case. Can you imagine! As if these mexicans aren&rsquo;nt racist themselves! </p>
<p>And if you are a racist, does this mean that others of another race are allowed to rape, rob and steal-with impunity?  </p>
