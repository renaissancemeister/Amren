<h1>Police: &#8216;Brazen&rsquo; Suspect Returned to Scene of Midtown Slaying</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Morris and Tim Eberly, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Their fateful meeting at the high-rise Midtown condo complex  &mdash;  the prominent cancer researcher and the young man described by police as a two-bit criminal  &mdash;  was nothing but chance.</p>
<p>Eugenia &#8220;Jeanne&#8221; Calle, who had a condo on the Aqua building&rsquo;s 20th floor, was walking her gray poodle.</p>
<p>Shamal Thompson, 22, fresh off a meal at a nearby Checkers fast-food restaurant, wandered in under the pretense of shopping for condos in the luxury building that boasts private elevators, around-the-clock security and skyline-view homes that cost as much as $2.5 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just two weeks into retirement, Calle wanted to sell her condo so she could move in with her fiance.</p>
<p>While crossing through Aqua&rsquo;s lobby, she overheard Thompson and a real-estate agent chatting about taking a tour of two condos that were for sale, Meadows said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said, &#8216;Don&rsquo;t forget about mine. It&rsquo;s for sale, also,&rsquo;&#8221; Meadows said.</p>
<p>Thompson didn&rsquo;t. After the tour, a security guard called Calle and said that Thompson was in the lobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like for me to escort him up?&#8221; the guard asked Calle, according to Meadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&rsquo;ll be fine,&#8221; Calle responded. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want him to think that we don&rsquo;t trust him.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Thompson, who also goes by Jamal Thompson, headed up on his own around 2 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>He spent 20 to 30 minutes in the unit before hitting Calle on the back of the head with an unknown object in the kitchen, Meadows said.</p>
<p>Thompson told a police detective after his arrest that he pushed Calle and that she hit her head on the kitchen counter. He told police he didn&rsquo;t know she had died, Meadows said.</p>
<p>He dragged her into the pantry, took a diamond ring off her finger, about $68 in cash, her credit cards and her condo electronic swipe card before leaving, Meadows said. She died from blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>Calle&rsquo;s body was discovered about nine hours later, around 11 p.m. Tuesday, by her fiance, an Atlanta tax attorney whose name has not been released.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detectives had already identified Thompson as the suspect and were actively looking for him when he returned late Wednesday night with two unwitting friends to the Aqua building, located at the corner of West Peachtree and 10th streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thompson, who has been arrested previously for burglary, is charged with murder and robbery by force. At his first court appearance Thursday he was ordered held without bond. A preliminary hearing has been set for March 6.</p>
<p>Court and arrest records indicate Thompson has several prior arrests, stretching back to his high school days in Gwinnett County.</p>
<p>Records listed Thompson as a student at Meadowcreek High School when he was arrested in Gwinnett in May 2005 for theft by taking and theft by receiving, in connection with a stolen Toyota Corolla. He pleaded guilty to one count of theft by receiving and was sentenced to five years of probation.</p>
<p>DeKalb County jail records show at least two arrests, one of which resulted in conviction.</p>
<p>In 2006, Thompson was arrested by DeKalb police on burglary charges. He was sentenced last April to 10 years in prison, with six months to serve. He was credited with about two months&rsquo; time served and the sentence was reduced to time served, court records show.</p>
<p>A renowned epidemiologist, Calle retired last month from her post as vice president of the epidemiology department at the Atlanta-based American Cancer Society. Her research in epidemiology, which is the study of disease, helped establish the link between cancer and obesity, and cancer and diet.</p>

			<p>Only a MSM Obama brain washed white person would be this stupid.  How on earth would she ever think a 22 year old black man would have even a remote chance on qualifying to buy her condo?  It&rsquo;s sad, but part thinks if this is what it takes for white people to wake up, so be it. Too bad most whites will never hear about it. </p>

			<p>Another White woman sacrificed in the name of diversity, even if it was of her own doing.</p>
<p>How foolish of her, but, then again, it is almost illegal in our society to warn her of such dangers.</p>
<p>I just sent this story to my daughters.  They will not end up like this doctor or this newscaster:</p>

			<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Calle responded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to think that we don&rsquo;t trust him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The statement above in a nutshell shows what liberalism can do to an otherwise brilliant mind.  She hoped he could be trusted and didn&rsquo;t want to seem &#8220;racist&#8221; and the cost for this folly was her life.  This woman lived in Atlanta, she knew that black males are responsible for damn near every crime in that city and still she had rather take an enormous risk than offend a black.  </p>

			<p>They must be putting something in the water, because this goes beyond liberalism and naivete - clinical psychosis. </p>
<p>I lived in Manhattan in the 90s, and a black kid you don&rsquo;t know well in your building on any pretext whatsoever means your life is in imminent danger. </p>

			<p>&#8220;theft by receiving and was sentenced to five years of probation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Auto theft is reduced to &#8216;theft by receiving&rsquo; and a sentence of probation. If you&rsquo;re black and living in &#8216;unjust&rsquo; America. <br>

			<p>What a sad ending to a very full life for this woman. My heart goes out to her family and fiance. But, although this woman was highly educated, she was obviously lacking common sence. But sadly, most Whites in this country are just like her. They have no racial &#8220;compass&#8221; and bend over backward [and sometimes forward] to show they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racisss&#8221;. And it ends up costing them their lives. I can&rsquo;t believe this thug had the nerve to show up the very next day trying to get into the penthouse.Unbelievable! And he said he pushed her and didn&rsquo;t realize she died. Even if that is what happened, why did he push her! I&rsquo;ve looked at alot of properties in my day and not once did I ever push any of the owners down while they showed me around. </p>

			<p>A number of people have commented that she was foolish for showing him the condo.</p>
<p>  But remember: under the so-called civil rights laws, it would have been ILLEGAL for her not to show him the condo if he requested it and her decision was based on his race, age and gender.  Of course, she&rsquo;s still foolish for showing him the condo   &mdash;   better to break the law than seriously put oneself in danger.  But it&rsquo;s a sad commentary on our society that if she had done the smart thing and ignored him, she could have faced legal liability.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want him to think I don&rsquo;t trust him&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Why not? There is nothing irrational in being cautious and wary and prudent when dealing with a complete and total stranger. She doesn&rsquo;t know the guy. She should be wary. Even if the guy had been White she still should have had some kind of security or at least someone else there with her. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how liberalism - the desperate desire to avoid the appearance of &#8220;offending&#8221; blacks, not that they think anymore of you for the effort - causes so many otherwise very intelligent people to do such foolish things. </p>

			<p>Thank God for the internet. And thank God for Amren. I had just found out about the race riot in Augusta Georgia at the time my wife was returning from Atlanta to our home in Tennessee. Of course this was not on the news, but I contacted her and warned her not to stop for anything until she was way outside of Atlanta. The only news I seek comes from the Internet and not the indoctrination of television. Of course, as long as it is available.</p>

			<p>And we continue to suffer under the Double Standard. </p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t receive national attention. The SPLC will ignore it. Another long line of idiot black defendants will continue with ludicrous &#8220;All I did was push her&#8221; excuses. </p>
<p>Uninformed, or perhaps willfully blind, most white people will continue to ignore what their instincts scream at them. </p>
<p>Why is it that if a white person observed another white person acting rudely or suspiciously, especially in the close confines of a condominium, words might quickly be exchanged? So why not confront blacks with the same aggressive interest, especially when statistics bear out their predisposition to violent, criminal behavior? </p>
<p>Tell me, what is it about blacks that whites need to be so intimidated about?</p>

			<p>Many posters have  blamed this on a lack of common sense.</p>
<p>I would suggest another alternative: Arrogance, lack of humility.</p>
<p>After all, it is White people who go about &#8220;saving&#8221; everyone and everything on the planet.</p>
<p>We think we have such power! </p>
<p>We can save the pagan from his darkness, we can save the earth from global warming, we can save people from aids, we can save inner city wretches from their lifestyle, we can save the oppressed by militarily imposing &#8220;democracy&#8221; &hellip; if they will accept our benevolent ministrations!</p>
<p>I believe this woman thought she could save this miscreant from his bad self image, or at least not contribute to it, by showing him acceptance. </p>
<p>If I could fault the entire White race for an endemic sin, it would be that of arrogance.</p>
<p>May the gods save ME from my arrogance, and grant me the humility of the great Greek philosophers!   </p>

<p><br>
No. They will not.</p>
<p>We need to come up with imaginative names for all these crimes that &#8220;are not hate crimes&#8221; - the implication meaning that these Black on White crimes must be either ignored, excused, explained away as something else = &#8220;a cry for help, understanding&#8221;.</p>
<p>My term I would like to submit is:</p>
<p>&#8220;Love crimes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since they can&rsquo;t be &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; - all these murders must be &#8220;love crimes&#8221;. So could our elected officials please do something about the exploding number of &#8220;love crimes&#8221; which are about 99.9 % of violent crimes compared to .1% of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;.</p>

			<p>I disagree with the statements that most whites would have allowed this predator for fear of being called a racist. Over 90% of whites would have the common sense to send this obvious thief and murderer packing. Perhaps the most evil aspect of political correctness is how it overrides basic survival instinct in whites. Political correctness is not silly - it is a matter of life and death.</p>

			<p>This poor woman was the victim of a culture of lies. The truth is revolution, nowadays. The television shows us images of cruel, racist Whites who must be shown the way of kindness and noble behavior by blacks. If not for Africans, we would all be a bunch of silly squares who couldn&rsquo;t dance, rap, or perform open heart surgery. With all of that cultural baggage mitigating against common sense, the solitary surprise here is that this doesn&rsquo;t happen every single day. Perhaps it does, the media will never tell. </p>
<p>How many &#8220;copdramas&#8221; present the following formula every other show; murder occurs. Racist cops have black suspect. Black suspect refuses to talk, cops think he is guilty. Turns out, Black suspect was busy in his laboratory doing cancer research or inventing a solar powered rocket ship. Cops are taught a lesson about the nobility of the black man. In the end, the guilty party is the White businessman/lawyer/police officer/professor. </p>
<p>Historically, the stories we tell enlighten and educate. Cultures develop mythologies, plays, parables in order to illuminate truths. American culture has been poisoned, and now performs just the opposite service, it lies to us. It causes us to feel that which we should not, and do that which we ought not. This poor White Genius was lied to by everything she should have been able to trust, and in the end that took her life. Either turn the TV off, of make sure your children understand that they are being lied to!</p>

			<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. PC is the killer of the White race. Just ask any nonwhite.</p>
<p> These types of ignorant, gullible Whites almost deserve what they get. Didn&rsquo;t the parents of Christian/Newsome &#8220;forgive&#8221; their child&rsquo;s killers? The same with Amy Biehl&rsquo;s parents and don&rsquo;t forget that Reginald Denny who forgave his black assaulters during the Rodney King riots. These types of people disgusts me to no end because they leave a message that to forgive is what it is all about! Do they really think that nonwhites suffer from any guilt or appeciate their &#8220;forgiveness&#8221;? NO!!!</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, what is it about blacks that Whites need to be so intimidated about&#8221;,,,,</p>
<p>Excellent point. So what if they call us &#8220;racist&#8221;. Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me. Out of the mouths of babes&hellip;and its so true. Whites have nothing really to gain from going out of their way for blacks. They won&rsquo;t think anything more of us for it. Black hatred of Whites is pathological and ineradicable. Trying to &#8220;be nice&#8221; to blacks simply makes them all the more aggressive and demanding. Your much better to draw a line in the sand and not budge from it. There is no point in trying to win them over and appeasement is a self-defeating strategy. I really couldn&rsquo;t care less what blacks think about me at all. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m not a crime statistic.</p>

<p>It actually happens every 15 minutes - and that is just rape (37,000 black on white rapes a year).</p>
<p>Thrown altogether, a white is probably victimized by a black, in some manner, every 10 minutes - but our politicians talk about &#8220;nooses&#8221; and rebel flags.</p>

<p>The story says she heard him talking to a realtorna and POINTED OUT that her condo was for sale too.</p>
<p>She must have been a bit socially retarded to honestly think a 22 year old thug could afford a place like that. <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely true Kevin (read his post). She was not obliged in that moment to show him anything. He was a walk-in, so to speak. He had no appointment. <br>
If she had asked him to make an appointment and then said, &#8220;that way my husband and I and a repersentative from the real estate agency can show you the place and discuss particulars.&#8221;  He would never have shown and she&rsquo;d still be alive. <br>
I know because something very similar happened to my ex and I. She is a beautiful petite Japanese woman who despite her appearance is smart as a whip and as tough as nails, with a deep, aggressive and unapologetic disdain for blacks. She owned a small apartment and when we moved into something bigger she wanted to rent. It was a live and learn thing. Long story short, she got a call from &#8220;a black&#8221; was what she said to me. &#8220;He sounds stupid&#8221; she said, bluntly, with her hand over the phone. &#8220;What should I do.&#8221;  Apparently, he told my ex he was in the neighborhood (which I don&rsquo;t doubt - these guys DO this, it&rsquo;s their whole scam) and wanted to come over now if possible (well of course!). <br>
So I got on the phone and spoke to him in a friendly manner and made an appointment and told him he&rsquo;d have to wait a couple of days because the realtor would have to be there with us, plus they are painting the place, so, as long as you don&rsquo;t mind, it&rsquo;s a bit crowded here. He said it was ok, so we made an appointment and that was that.  Never heard from him again. I was just winging it. Of course the realtor doesn&rsquo;t have to be there, she owned the place. But that&rsquo;s how we handled it, best we could, in the moment, to avoid problems and get rid of the guy cause he stunk from high heavens even over the phone.</p>
<p>This woman precipitated, and it cost her her life. </p>

Civilwrongs,</p>
<p>Good job.  Whenever a black commits a crime against a white, it is to be called a &#8220;love crime.&#8221;  As in, &#8220;I love white people so much it just makes me go crazy and attack them.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then we can have:  <i>The jury ruled not guilty because the crime was a love crime, caused by an excess of love for all mankind. The defendent was set free. </i></p>

			<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Calle responded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to think that we don&rsquo;t trust him.&rsquo; &ldquo; </p>
<p>Blacks have spent years continuously trying to put whites on guilt trips for not trusting them. They forever whine about how racist white clerks, will eye them suspiciously when they are in stores. Or will, complain about white women clutching their purses tightly in hand, when they step in an elevator. Whites are expected to ignore the grim stats on black on white crime, because a few of them could be trustworthy, and this continuous assault of white-guilt, has placed whites in peril. Even Oprah tried the same when she was in Paris, by crying racism, because a shopkeeper wouldn&rsquo;t allow her in at closing time. The honest truth is, stereotypes are based on reality. It&rsquo;s a shame, she didn&rsquo;t ignore him, and keep walking, once she saw who was asking for a tour.</p>

			<p>BTW, this guy wasn&rsquo;t being &#8220;brazen&#8221; returning to the scene.  He probably wanted to appear to be innocent.</p>
<p>If only this woman would have read the Atlanta papers from over 15 years ago, she might not have made this mistake.</p>
<p>My grandmother was brutally murdered in her home by a 21 year old black man.  He, too, returned to the neighborhood, after the murder and after the trial, before being run off.</p>
<p>In spite of the jury having his signed confession, fingerprints in the house and his roommate testifying that &#8220;he told me he killed an old woman that night,&#8221; the jury found him &#8220;not guilty.&#8221;  His black lawyer said &#8220;I was surprised by the verdict, the evidence was overwhelming.&#8221; </p>
<p>That truth didn&rsquo;t keep him, at the reading of the verdict, from high-fiving with the murderer in front of my family and my grief-stricken mother, my grandmother&rsquo;s only child.</p>

			<p>The &#8220;alleged&#8221; murderer said he didn&rsquo;t even know she was dead.  Makes no sense then why he would return and try to access the apartment again.  If he just wounded her, wouldn&rsquo;t he be scared that the police would be there waiting for him?  That she would have notified the police by now?  I mean he wasn&rsquo;t a first time criminal, but more like on his way to a life of crime.  He knows how it works, you commit a crime - the victim calls the police.  A reasonable expectation that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go back to the apartment.  My conclusion - of course the liar knew he killed her.  I hope he gets everything he deserves and then some.</p>

			<p>Only a MSM Obama brain washed white person would be this stupid. How on earth would she ever think a 22 year old black man would have even a remote chance on qualifying to buy her condo?</p>
<p>ACORN would see that he could get it, why not after all ACORN has done for other blacks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;But remember: under the so-called civil rights laws, it would have been ILLEGAL for her not to show him the condo if he requested it and her decision was based on his race, age and gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have a strange man of any race alone with me in my apartment, &amp; I&rsquo;d make that real clear up-front to everyone involved.  Even white guys sometimes make me nervous.  A third party should be there, for safety, just on principle.  </p>

			<p>Perhaps there is some benefit to whites attending integrated public schools after all. Once having been beaten, robbed, and verbally insulted by their diverse schoolmates, their attitudes toward minorities usually set hard like concrete; they become wary of and wholly unsympathetic toward &#8220;people of color.&#8221; I have one Ivy League friend with a PhD in Computer Science whose brilliant faculty parents thought it would be a wonderful idea to enroll him in a Detroit public high school. After one vicious bloody assault he decided to continue his education in a nearby public library (his school didn&rsquo;t notice), where it was safer (though smellier because of the homeless people). To this day he still mutters the &#8216;N&rsquo; word and tells some of the most wickedly funny ethnic jokes I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>In my opinion, he has the right.</p>

			<p>Another stupid white liberal woman. They never learn. Even as she was dying, she likely was hoping that whites would not respond to her murder with &#8216;racism.&rsquo; If she is like most of them, she would choose to prosecute me for &#8216;racist thinking&rsquo; than to have her murderer pay the price fo his crimes with his worthless life.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Would you like for me to escort him up?&rdquo; the guard asked Calle, according to Meadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Calle responded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to think that we don&rsquo;t trust him.&#8221; </p>
<p>Classic.</p>
<p>It reminds me of another Amren news article about a rape:</p>
<p>&#8220;Connors speculates that she might have run away in the awkward moments before David Francis attacked her had it not been for the fear that she&rsquo;d appear racist.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&amp;aid=143231" rel="nofollow">http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=58&aid;=143231</a></p>
<p>When will white people learn the best advice I&rsquo;ve gotten from posts at Amren: </p>
<p>AVOID BLACKS!</p>
<p>I must have been reading that advice on this site for two years before it finally occurred to me to TAKE it.</p>
<p>Since then, my daily life here in Berkeley, Ca. is noticeably more pleasant  &mdash;  I always talk to the white clerk, not the black clerk, etc, etc. etc, and so I no longer get &#8216;tude and insults. And worse.</p>
<p>Some few blacks that I&rsquo;ve come to know over the years, I enjoy talking to, but ALL unknown blacks, I try to avoid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just part of keeping life simple.</p>

			<p>This would never happen to my fiance, because she knows how to use a 9mm. Thats why I never worry about her when she is alone with minorities or any other men, because they tried this with her they would get dealt with because she&rsquo;s quick on the draw.</p>
<p>She carries a 9mm or a 22mm in her purse all the time. She also use to be in the US ARMY. Some one tried to break in to my house back when I single, I didnt hesitate to let off a few rounds in his direction. I lived around blacks and hispanics and I dont fear them at all. I go into gang related neighborhoods hoping someone would start drama with me.</p>

			<p>As the late science-fiction author Robert Heinlein once said, &#8220;Stupidity is a crime that carries the death penalty, and it mercilessly enforces its own punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidents like this offer continuing proof that Political Correctness really is like a religion to its adherents.  Not only are the basic assumptions not subject to debate - which clearly classes them as dogma, not only do its adherents regard rational arguments against their claims with confusion and eventual hostility, and not only do its adherents treat &#8220;racist&#8221; non-believers with the shock and loathing early Christians once reserved for witches, but the beliefs are retained no matter how completely nonsensical or life-threateningly dangerous they may be.</p>
<p>This is not a rational ideology.  This is a religion, a collective delusion, a mass-hysteria.</p>

			<p>Just AVOID blacks, people. I can&rsquo;t say that my life would in any way have been any worse If I had never seen, spoken or interacted with any black. I can&rsquo;t see how having blacks around me in any way &#8220;enriched&#8221; or &#8220;improved&#8221; my life. (It&rsquo;s not like a black ever saved my life or gave me a million dollars or something). In fact my life would probably have been better if I had never laid eyes on any black. I don&rsquo;t see how anything positive can come from any interaction with them. </p>
