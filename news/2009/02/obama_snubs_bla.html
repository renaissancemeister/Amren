			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Curl, Washington Times, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After the first black president completed his first prime-time press conference, the black press was red hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were window dressing,&#8221; said Hazel Edney, a reporter with the National Newspaper Publishers Association, also known as the Black Press of America. &#8220;We were nothing more than window dressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the media filed into the stately White House East Room on Monday night, the reporter was shocked to find herself in the front row. Alongside her were the top news agencies, Associated Press, Reuters; also up front, 86-year-old Helen Thomas, who started covering presidents 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Alongside the most prominent journalists in America was Tiffany Cross from Black Entertainment Television. Like Miss Edney, she didn&rsquo;t know why she was in first-class while all the television networks  &mdash;  every single one  &mdash;  was exiled to the steerage compartment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While most on the front row got to pose a question to President Obama, the two reporters from the black press did not. Nor did any other black-press reporter, for that matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was like Reagan, when he&rsquo;d put all the blacks up front,&#8221; said another prominent but visibly peeved black-press reporter who asked to remain anonymous. &#8220;He oughta&rsquo; be ashamed.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Obama knows which side his bread is buttered on.  Somehow that little piece of news is not going to make mainstream headlines.  Mulatto Blacks sometimes look down on other Blacks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost funny when you realise that the black reporters interviewed are <i>light years</i> away from the conclusion that government mandated-and-enforced &#8220;diversity&#8221; - whether it&rsquo;s in the university, the office or the hospital - is <b>just window dressing</b> - the same <a href="/news/2009/02/commentary_obam.html" rel="nofollow">&#8220;window-dressing&#8221; other blacks are clamouring for!</a>.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This was like Reagan, when he&rsquo;d put all the blacks up <br>
front,&rdquo; said another prominent but visibly peeved black-press reporter who asked to remain anonymous. &ldquo;<b>He oughta&rsquo; be ashamed</b>.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, well, well - &#8220;ashamed&#8221;?:<br>
I suppose this scenario is already running through the minds of those reading this story on American Renaissance, but Obama would be called <i>a lot</i> worse things if he was white.</p>

Blacks support black politicians because they believe everything is going to change in a heartbeat. Blacks are the first ones disappointed by their choices and complain bitterly that they&rsquo;re getting the short end of the stick.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;change&#8221; standing on it&rsquo;s own is ambiguous. More people should have asked &#8216;what are the changes you&rsquo;re going to implement?&rsquo;<br>

<p>Laughing Out Loud, with the greatest of ironic mirth!</p>
<p>Maybe Comrade BO, isn&rsquo;t quite as foolish as he looks?</p>
<p>Why on God&rsquo;s great green earth, would he ask any of the truculently arrogant buffoons of the &#8220;black-press&#8221; anything? His point last night was not to incite a riot, or spin demented conspiracy rants into something even remotely articulate; his point last night, was to sell a bill dedicated to &#8220;stimulating&#8221; the economy through the excessive printing and devaluing of our currency to the country as a whole. Or put another way, he wanted to place party-patronage based Zimbabwean style aristocratic Marxism, over ghetto street theater.</p>
<p>Not the best 4-year-plan for &#8220;change&#8221; without a doubt, but far better than instant hip-hopeless chaos and carnage to be sure.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>The Black reporters shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad.  Obama is &#8216;window dressing&rsquo; too.  I guess sitting in the front of the bus, a la Rosa Parks, aint all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about.  He called upon two black reporters during the press conference, and one of them, a black male reporter asked him an inane question (when we have all of these economic problems) about what he thought about Alex Rodriquez using steroids.  He should call on black reporters more often so we can find out more important and intriguing information about Obama such as: who is Obama&rsquo;s favorite NBA basketball team, who he thinks is the better player LeBron or Kobe, who is his favorite rapper, did he catch BET the night before, what is his favorite barbecue sauce, and so forth.  </p>

			<p>Obama&rsquo;s advisors have explained that all questions for him are from individuals who have been pre-designated, because they&rsquo;re part of his cheer leading team with a few exceptions, who might not be as brazen as the others, but certainly they&rsquo;re radical leftists, including the lovely Helen Thomas, who marches to an entirely different drummer than the rest of the civilized world.</p>
<p>But I must say for a president to constantly predict emminent catastrope and a possible total destruction in the world economy, he certainly has appeared quite jovial at times, joking, smiling and seeming to be completely unconcerned.</p>
<p>If I truly believed the country was on the edge of collapse, I think my demeanor would be very serious and grave, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure most other presidents would be the same way with the possible exception of Clinton, who would not hesitate one second to order and anchovie pizza if a comet were headed on a direct path to the earth and could not be avoided.</p>
<p>That kind of attitude I&rsquo;m pretty sure is typical of those who have had their personalities altered to a significant degree from taking drugs so many times in their youth.  It permanently alters the brain in various ways.  </p>

			<p>What did they expect?  A volley just between him and them?  Oh, just wait.  Black folks are gonna be up in arms with this brutha.  I hate to be the first one to tell them but he has only one loyalty and that is to himself.  He uses people as he goes along and it&rsquo;s worked very well so far.  Let&rsquo;s see how long the love affair lasts.  My crystal ball says&hellip;.. less than six months for black folks and an entire generation or two for white Pinkos and Commies.<br>

			<p>Did anyone catch the question a black woman asked him when he met with the folks down in Florida? She was complaining about her personal situation. She was out of work and her house was being foreclosed. She was wondering what Obama was going to do for her personally. Perhaps pay her mortgage and pay for gasoline for her car a la Peggy Joseph. Then they wonder why he is reluctant to call on blacks.</p>

			<p>I highly doubt he did this intentionally if you notice he was reading of a list or looking at people he new from different sources such as CNN. This is very strange but who cares this wont fix our economy or our military problem. They should have asked him about NEW ORLEANS instead of baseball questions.</p>
<p>We have three wars ( two in the middle east and one at our borders) were fighting right now and we are bickering about this very unimportant subject. I want to here about what he is going to do about the displacement of AMERICANS in their own country, by illegals and HB-1 visas all of whom the tax payer is responsible for.</p>

			<p>Maybe Obama was smart enough to figure the Black &#8216;reporters&rsquo; got their jobs through Affirmative Action rather than knowlege and capability. Like that clown with the steroids question.</p>

			<p>Too funny, Ranger, and an excellent point!</p>
<p>If our economic situation is so catastrophically dire, why is Barack Obama so calm?  </p>
<p>Also, I absolutely love the fact that blacks are already complaining about their beloved messiah!  First, black designers were complaining about Michelle; and now black reporters are complaining about Barack&hellip;  </p>
<p>Next thing we know, we&rsquo;ll see Al Sharpton and his gang dancing at the doors!</p>
<p>Too much!</p>

			<p>The sad reality is that the majority of blacks will never overcome their own sense of inferiority, regardless of what positions they occupy in society.  </p>
<p>It is precisely because one must EARN one&rsquo;s place in the world through hard-work, cooperation and talent.  (OK, connections don&rsquo;t hurt, either).  The more concessions we make and the more society does to create parity, the worse it will get, as blacks delude themselves and the rest of us are forced to partake of the delusion.  NOT a good recipe for peaceful living.  </p>
<p>Until blacks as a group become honest about their own self-limiting behaviors and corruption; and until these can be discussed openly and rationally by EVERYONE, American society will only get worse.</p>

<p>Drew has got the right idea. Obama was not discovered, groomed, managed, packaged, and put into office by blacks. Hence his  first loyalty is not to them but to his &#8220;creators&#8221;, the people who did make him what he is today.  It&rsquo;s not blacks.  They&rsquo;re very mistaken if they think they are.<br>

			<p>Any black person who is shocked by this is either a deluded Obamamaniac or an idiot. 0bama has about as much loyalty to those of his own skin color as a car has to it&rsquo;s owner; all he cares about is getting a regular supply of &#8216;gas&rsquo; (the green kind) in his &#8216;engine&rsquo;. The only improvement (if you can call it that) that black people will see from him is even more welfare handouts, as if their work ethic weren&rsquo;t already cut off at the knees.</p>
<p>If you voted for this con man of your own free will, know this: Obama is playing you like a DVD. If there&rsquo;s one thing he does know how to do well it is to fool people!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve said from the beinning that Obama&rsquo;s in this for himself. It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s indifferent to the &#8220;woes&#8221; of blacks, it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s more interested in basking in the glory of being the first black president and the savior of the world from her woes, and he knows that he can&rsquo;t be the world-famous celebrity he is now if he becomes too associated with the real black community.</p>
