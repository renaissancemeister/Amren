<h1><a href="https://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i25/25a01201.htm">A Fresh Look at the Lives of Civil War Soldiers Reveals the High Price of Diversity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Glenn, Chronicle of Higher Education, February 27, 2009, </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In <cite>Heroes and Cowards: The Social Face of War</cite> (Princeton University Press), Dora L. Costa and Matthew E. Kahn report that military units were more cohesive if they were composed of men who looked, voted, and worshiped like one another. Diverse units, meanwhile, did not fare as well.</p>
<p>The book is likely to draw attention from a wide variety of scholars  &mdash;  historians, political scientists, sociologists  &mdash;  because it brings a new kind of evidence to a longstanding debate about diversity and social cohesion that goes far beyond the Civil War. Scholars of education finance, for example, sometimes talk about a &#8220;Florida effect&#8221;: The typical property-tax payer in Florida is elderly and white, but the typical public-school student is Latino. In states where taxpayers are more similar to students, citizens tend to be more willing to invest public dollars in education. Ms. Costa and Mr. Kahn say that they do not support segregation of any kind  &mdash;  but that it is crucial to understand the costs associated with heterogeneity.</p>
<p><b>The Cost of Diversity</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the book&rsquo;s central questions is why more Union Army soldiers didn&rsquo;t desert. (The Union Army&rsquo;s desertion rate was about 9 percent.) More than 300,000 of them died during the Civil War  &mdash;  a fatality rate far higher, per capita, than in any other American war. Given that high risk of death, many historians have wondered why more soldiers didn&rsquo;t flee.</p>
<p>The answer was almost certainly not the legal risk: Fewer than 400 Union soldiers were executed for desertion, and nearly half of the captured deserters were not formally punished at all.</p>
<p>In their statistical analyses, which cover more than 35,000 white soldiers and more than 5,000 black soldiers, Ms. Costa and Mr. Kahn demonstrate that certain individual traits were linked to desertion. All else equal, soldiers were less likely to desert if they were born in the United States or Germany than if they were born in Ireland, England, or elsewhere. Soldiers were less likely to desert if they were literate and had high incomes. And soldiers were less likely to desert if they were farmers than if they were artisans or laborers.</p>
<p>But Ms. Costa and Mr. Kahn also propose  &mdash;  and this is the heart of their book&rsquo;s argument  &mdash;  that the soldiers&rsquo; social environments had effects above and beyond those personal characteristics. Holding all of the individual traits constant, white soldiers were less likely to desert if they fought alongside soldiers who were similar to them in terms of occupation, region, ethnicity, and religion. In African-American companies, soldiers were less likely to desert if they fought alongside soldiers from the same region. (Over all, black soldiers were slightly less likely to desert than were whites.) After the war, deserters were less likely to go home if their home counties were strongly pro-war (as measured by votes in the 1864 presidential election).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A Broad Scope of Data</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he [Thomas E. Rodgers, an instructor of history at the University of Southern Indiana] isn&rsquo;t sure that the authors fully understand the context of Civil War recruitment. For one thing, he says, they might be too quick to assume that new soldiers actually had roots in the county where they enlisted and shared its general opinion of the war. &#8220;When you look at the 19th century in general,&#8221; he says, &#8220;young men moved all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the two economists insist that on its own terms, their Civil War study tells a powerful story: Social networks matter. In a forthcoming paper in the journal Demography, they report that in Union veterans&rsquo; old age, their health was worse if they had experienced a high amount of battle stress during the war. That isn&rsquo;t surprising. The paper&rsquo;s startling finding is that among veterans whose military companies had been highly cohesive, the effect disappeared. Something about the experience of close kinship appears to have insulated the men from some of the long-term costs of warfare.</p>
<p><b>Lifetime Benefits</b></p>
<p>Not all the news about diversity in <em>Heroes and Cowards</em> is negative. Among African-American soldiers, recently freed slaves seem to have experienced long-term benefits if they served in diverse units with large numbers of Northern black freemen. The higher the proportion of freemen, the more likely the former slaves were to move north and become literate later in life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a previous paper on economic diversity and community life, Ms. Costa and Mr. Kahn criticized the political scientist Robert D. Putnam&rsquo;s much-debated 2000 book, <cite>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.</cite> Mr. Putnam, they said, had exaggerated the decline of American civic life and had looked in the wrong places for explanations. According to Ms. Costa and Mr. Kahn, we shouldn&rsquo;t blame television or overwork or urban design. The real explanation is the rise in social heterogeneity, which makes people slower to form bonds of trust.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For good or ill, the instant trust that comes from regional and ethnic ties can be a powerful force. In the Andersonville prison camp in South Carolina in 1864, imprisoned Union soldiers tried desperately to find unity against &#8220;raiders&#8221;  &mdash;  marauding bands of fellow prisoners who stole food and brutalized their victims.</p>
<p>According to a war memoir quoted by Ms. Costa and Mr. Kahn, the raiders were finally defeated by men from the Midwest who &#8220;spoke the same dialect, read the same newspapers, had studied McGuffey&rsquo;s Readers, Mitchell&rsquo;s Geography, and Ray&rsquo;s Arithmetics at school, admired the same men and generally held the same opinions on any given subject. It was never difficult to get them to act in unison.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Princeton University Press published this book? A mainstream outlet would do this? </p>
<p>//<br>
The Left&rsquo;s response to this will be interracial marriage. Remember the awful Sarkozy lecture on the future of France depending on half-breed children? Even the most stubborn Whites realize something is amiss. Diversity is dead. Get ready for a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; society with no reliable stats on crime or SAT/standardized test scores and lots &#8220;attractive&#8221; mixed celebrities. They&rsquo;re not done destroying Whites yet.</p>

			<p>This is why the elites want diversity. More diversity means fewer people mad at the government for any particular reason, and that keeps the elites permanently entrenched.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old saying: Democracy, Multiculturalism, Diversity - pick any two. Our masters have selected the latter two for us.</p>

			<p>&#8220;In the Andersonville prison camp in South Carolina in 1864,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Andersonville prison (properly known as Fort Sumter) was 10 miles north of Americus, Georgia. Not far from Alabama, but by no means anywhere near South Carolina.</p>

			<p>All I wish to say is that Andersonville was in south Georgia. Diversity breeds conflict, tension and violence, we all know that. The shame is that we actually have to prove it. The white man arose over a hundred thousand years apart from the black man, and according to some it was a terrible thing to have happened. The idea that we could go on another one hundred thousand years without interbreeding with the blacks is completely unacceptable to most Americans. What harm would come to these poor blacks if we had returned them to Mother Africa in 1865 and kept our own Constitution and racial character intact? Where would have been the harm to mankind?</p>

			<p>The down side of this, from a military view, was that a town would see hundreds of names on a casualty list. Mind you, the armies were large and at a battle there might be few casualties, but if one unit was hit hard, the people of the home town would think the war was being lost.<br>
   Starting in WWI, the US army would send people to the units needed. Since casualties would be spread out throughout the nation, it had a lesser effect on national morale.<br>
   The military is the only organization in the US that can make diversity work. Oddly enough the supporters of diversity are so anti-military, that they are not encouraging this.</p>

			<p>The price of increasing diversity in this country is probably far greater than we can even imagine.  A white couple wishing to start a family is far more constrained in its choices today than 50 years ago, and must pay huge premiums to live in &#8220;safe,&#8221; i.e. white, neighborhoods, and send their children to &#8220;good,&#8221; i.e. expensive private, schools.</p>
<p>This is exacerbated by the fact that there are no white advocacy organizations, and little or no racial/ethnic consciousness among most white groups.  This means that whites no longer can defend their own neighborhoods, or establish conditions by which they can preserve an environment suitable for families, save for one   &mdash;   exorbitant home values, which incidentally keep out blacks and Hispanics, but poorer whites, too.</p>
<p>As commenters on this site have observed, this phenomenon explains a fair bit of the whole movement to the suburbs and &#8220;white flight&#8221; in general since the 1950s.  Denied the legal right to freely associate by the courts, and deprived of an ethnic consciousness by a state-run education system, whites flee farther and farther from the center, seeking but never really finding.  The increased financial burden of doing so leads them to reduce their number of children, which in turn worsens the demographic picture, leaving the next generation with ever-diminishing options.</p>
<p>The solution can&rsquo;t be to keep running.  Whites must face down the cities, even if it means a temporarily reduced standard of living.  Organization is the key.  Individuals, even rugged ones, are at the mercy of changing currents and population shifts.  A group of motivated people could begin to consciously carve out and reclaim an urban realm designed to be a nurturing place for white families.  Call it strategic gentrification   &mdash;   a process far faster and more effective than the gradual and patchwork natural process of gentrification.</p>
<p>Ok, way past Civil War soldiers here   &mdash;   but I think this sort of story gets to the heart of what Amren is all about! </p>

			<p>What a terrible mistake slavery was. Such a foolish, short-sighted policy. The abolitionists were right to oppose the slave trade, but for the wrong reasons.</p>

			<p> Diverse units, meanwhile, did not fare as well.</p>
<p>This is true in modern military units too, and the U.S. military command structure knows it.</p>
