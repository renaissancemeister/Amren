<h1>Iowa Trooper Suspended for Obama E-Mail</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KETV (Omaha), February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Iowa State trooper who was investigated after it was shown that he forwarded an e-mail showing mug shots of people wearing Obama t-shirts has been suspended for 30 days.</p>
<p>Sgt. Rodney Hicok was at home and off-duty when he forwarded the e-mails, said an official with the Iowa Department of Public Safety Bureau and Professional Standards.</p>
<p>The e-mail made disparaging remarks about 15 people in the photos and referred to Obama as having &#8220;quite a fan base.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement, Hicok said, &#8220;I am deeply sorry for my actions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I apologize to anyone this e-mail may have offended, as well as my family, citizens in my community and Iowa taxpayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret what happened and wish I could take it back,&#8221; Hicok said in the statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 27-year veteran, who has no prior offense on his record, will also attend DPS training on policies and procedures.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten this pic e-mailed to me five times, plus I&rsquo;ve seen it on a number of blogs.</p>
<p>My current state of Illinois is considering issuing an Obama license plate.  Somehow I think it&rsquo;ll serve the cops of Illinois very well, sorta like these T-shirts do.  What actually interests me more are the two white guys in this pic.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s 1984 folks.  Big Brother is here.  You have to watch what you say, to whom you say it to, or else your job and life can be ruined.  I read the novel when I was in high school back in the 1970&rsquo;s.  It made no sense back then, but I recently re-read the book and thirty years later it&rsquo;s all coming true.</p>

			<p>wow, haha is all i can say. We all already knew this all to be the case however he should known better than to actually say it, and the fact that it was a private letter only makes it that more horrible. You cross a line once you actually talk about the obvious.</p>

			<p>Tell the truth, make a joke or in any way offend the sensibilities of the delicate First family, or their liberal supporters and you must publicly abase yourself and apologize. Then you must take mandated re-education classes (usually called &#8220;sensitivity training&#8221; or &#8220;diversity awareness&#8221;)if you have any hope of retaining your livlihood. This is what living in a free country looks like 3 weeks into the term of the Magic Mulatto. As one reader puts it, &#8220;God help us all.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Free speech; especially pertaining to non-whites or non-Christians,hasn&rsquo;t existed for a very long time in this &#8220;veneer&#8221; of itself country.Free speech does, howerever, belong to all the diverse peoples already mentioned.What a &#8221; farce &#8221; America has become the last 55 years.</p>

			<p>Genius! Pictures really do say more than a 1000 words. And I know his apology is insincere and forced - as it should be. Keep tabs on this guy and make him attorney general when the Empty Suit is out of office.</p>

			<p>Oh my god, its said but true. Every gang banger in my neighborhood that has been arrested had this shirt on. Thats a scary thought. I voted for OBAMA but I find myself wanting to jump off a really high building when ever he talks or passes a bill. Does anyone else feel this way?</p>
<p>Its only been a few weeks so I will give him a chance. </p>

 <br>
 This pretty much means he will be forced to attend a <br>
reeducation class. The Marxists no longer use camps for<br>
this. Now they&rsquo;re known as diversity and sensitivity<br>
classes. Remember these are the same people always whining<br>
for civil rights and free speech. But only if you adhere<br>
to their politically correct dogmas. If you don&rsquo;t, they<br>
quickly reveal how hostile they truly are to civil rights<br>
and free speech. Yes as an above poster said, it is 1984.</p>

			<p>The trooper should just sue the living **** out of the state of Iowa for harassing him and creating a hostile work environment, or he should at least begin the process so THEY become the grovellers.  In Iowa at least he has a chance of getting a less-melanin loaded jury and winning, so I believe the state would back down first and in a big way.</p>
<p>For crying out loud, not only was he off duty in his private home and so on, the facts about the subjects in the email speak for themselves.  There is nothing in his employment policies and procedures, I&rsquo;m certain, that forbids him from engaging in political activity or speech outside of his official role/duties.</p>
<p>Personally I have found that in the workplace we must often be dhimmis when dealing with the anti-white, anti-conservative diversity gestapo, however there ARE circumstances when it is entirely tactically called for to go nuclear on the bastards and utterly scorch the earth they crawl around upon&hellip;they ALWAYS back down when you hit them with righteous and full-fisted legal force. </p>

			<p>Where&rsquo;s Obama picture? Is this his new White House staff or his cabinet?</p>
<p>If he had shot any of these in the line of duty, he probably would have gotten less time off and with pay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the ACLU won&rsquo;t come to his defense. This is just another example of over zealous Obama supporters defending their demigod. The same thing probably would have happened to him if he had sent around mug shots of people wearing Dr. King T-shirts.</p>
<p>If these people had been wearing Bush T-shirts, then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem.</p>

			<p>1984 - You&rsquo;ve got that right, friend. &#8220;Thought crime is so insidious. It just creeps up on you&#8221;. It&rsquo;s getting late in the game. If a stand is not taken, there will be nowhere to go - look at what is happening to Europe, especially England. </p>

			<p>From a link in the original story:</p>
<p>&#8220;The e-mail has a photo that was originally posted on TheSmokingGun.com, according to the ISP, and it was forwarded by Hicok to colleagues inside and outside the department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most LE agencies have policies that forbid E-mailing into the system from outside sources, to prevent, er, virus attacks (a thought in itself). So they won&rsquo;t stick this guy for &#8220;felony hatecrime,&#8221; but violation of department computer system policy. The content of the outside E-mail is irrelevant to this charge.</p>
<p>I say we still send him $20, care of his department. If we don&rsquo;t hear of him getting the checks, we go after the department for interfering with Sgt. Hicok&rsquo;s mail.</p>

			<p>To note that Obama&rsquo;s constituents are far more likely to be criminals may be offensive to the professionally sensitive.  Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a completely valid observation.  Blacks commit crimes at over eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined (The Color of Crime, Jared Taylor), which is to say that they commit nearly half the crime in the country, though accounting for only 13% of the population. Almost all blacks voted for Obama.  Thus, a large portion of Obama&rsquo;s constituency belongs to the criminal class in this country.  And this cop gets suspended for merely forwarding an e-mail which states the obvious?  He should sue the state of Iowa for infringement of his 1st Amendment rights.</p>

			<p>The new, Black, U.S. Attorney General just today said that America was a &#8220;nation of cowards&#8221; on racial issues.  Well, when a man has his job threatened for forwarding an E-mail on his own computer and his own time, it&rsquo;s only prudent to keep quiet.  The leftists and multiculturalists are the cowards.  They would be terrified at the prospect of an honest, open discussion of racial issues, which is exactly why they always try to shut down or shout down Jared Taylor wherever he speaks.  </p>

			<p>Instead of criminals it should say future supporters of a Marixist, Socialist, and facist government. These people make are probably dope heads as well. The officer didnt need to be placed in trouble for his comments. It&rsquo;s like when I went to high school and the teachers said he couldnt wear blue or read baseball caps because of the gang violence. I guess they should have been repremanded as well.</p>
<p>In my neighborhood everyone I&rsquo;ve seen being pulled over or arrested had OBAMA t shirts, parphenilla, or bumper stickers. Same goes for the local gang bangers, they wear red obama parapenilla and some wear blue to conceal the fact that they are in a gang.</p>

And for that, a 30 day suspension, a public groveling, and &#8220;retraining&#8221;?  <br>
I think he ought to play the &#8220;cornfield lottery&#8221;, and sue the State of Iowa for every penny he can get.  Let our enemies be as afraid of lawsuits as a ladder manufacturer.</p>
