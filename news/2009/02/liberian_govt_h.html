			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liberian Journal (Brooklyn Park, Minnesota), February 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Liberian Government says it is in discussions with US Government officials to address the threat of deportation hanging over Liberians residing in the United States of America. {snip}</p>
<p>In support of the continuing discussions between Liberian and US Government officials to consider an extension in the status of Liberians legally residing in the United States, more than 30 members of the United States Congress have signed a letter, requesting the administration of President Obama for an extension of the Temporary Protective Status for Liberians or grant Deferred Enforced Departure (DED). The request which has a bipartisan support was contained in a letter dated December 19, 2008, expressing deep concern that if TPS for Liberians in the United States were terminated, the country&rsquo;s recovery could be damaged severely and thousands of families separated and uprooted due to forced repatriation.</p>
<p>The leadership of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Congressional members noted, has put Liberia on a pathway to reform by rooting out corruption in the highest level of government, but pointed out, however, that the country&rsquo;s restoration remains a very difficult process. With high unemployment and an infrastructure that is still badly damaged, the US lawmakers argued, Liberia is in no place to welcome home its refugees. An influx of refugees the lawmakers agreed could have a destabilizing effect on the country&rsquo;s fledgling economic and social structures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The statement was signed by Congressmen Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Chicago; New Jersey Congressman Donald Payne and Sheila Jackson Lee of California, among others. A similar letter was also addressed to the outgoing administration of President George W. Bush in December last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Translation: America, and the West, are just dumping grounds for the &#8220;excess&#8221; populations of the Third World - who needs birth control or a lower birth rate when you can just export the increase to another country?</p>

			<p>Of course there is some lame excuse. How about them de-stabilizing our country? How about most of the immigrants, refugees and illegals since the 1965 Immigration Act de-stabilizing America and bringing it to balkanization? Does that count? </p>

			<p>My word, after 200 years Liberia&rsquo;s economy is still a fledgling.</p>
<p>What a load of nonsense.  Australia is now 200 years old.  Come &amp; have a look at this economy, the strongest in the world at the moment, Have a look at the infrastructure &amp; social programmes.</p>
<p>But there again we are not running around shooting one another.</p>
<p>Wake up Mr J Jackson &amp; Co.  Liberia will always be as it is now, a total shambles. Send those Liberians home before they infest your country &amp; reduce it to what they are trying to hide from.</p>

			<p>Why do Africans need to travel across entire oceans in order to feel safe outside their national boundaries? Even more importantly, where is all this &#8220;African Solidariety&#8221; I hear when the Brothas talk when it comes to taking in so-called &#8220;refugees?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or do the Africans know something about fellow Africans such that they conviently ignore their so-called &#8220;plight?&#8221;</p>

			<p> As usual American liberals are more worried about another<br/>
countries stability. But as usual could careless about<br/>
stability at home in America. As usual liberals are concerned with another 3rd world nations people &#8220;of color&#8221;. While as<br/>
usual ignoring the concerns of native born American Whites.</p>

			<p>There are 52 other countries in Africa, yet somehow Liberians must come to the United States.  Obama will never send them back.  His illegal Kenyan aunt is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  </p>

As I said, ain&rsquo;t no one gonna be sent back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more likely that after these talks the number of Liberian refugees to the US will increase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one-way street.</p>
<p>By black logic, it should be a humanitarian crime against Liberians to send them to a &#8216;racist&rsquo; country like America.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an Australian, I suggest that you know very little of the goings on in the North of your own country, you should learn to speak Indonesian.</p>
