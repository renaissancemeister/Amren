<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After practically vanishing from the presidential campaign in its waning days, the immigration reform issue is again the topic du jour among anti-immigration fire-breathers.</p>
<p>Trying to regroup after their loss, some Republicans wasted no time and just one week after the inauguration of President Obama met in Washington to argue that pandering to pro-amnesty Latino voters is not the way to go forward.</p>
<p>A press release listing their topics of discussion, includes this: &#8220;Whatever gains, if any, pandering to Hispanics gives is greatly outweighed by loss of the White Vote, which is more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Driving immigrants out and sealing the border are the best arguments to win future elections, according to the report &#8220;Immigration and the 2008 Republican Defeat,&#8221; also discussed at the Washington gathering, issued by the group American Cause and authored by Marcus Epstein.</p>
<p>The larger pool of white voters they&rsquo;re after get, in sizable numbers, their world view from conservative talk radio and Internet publications, where hate-mongering thrives, unchecked and unchallenged.</p>
<p>To their ears, the words &#8220;immigrant&#8221; and &#8220;Latino&#8221; are usually followed or preceded by adjectives such as &#8220;criminal,&#8221; &#8220;illegal,&#8221; &#8220;drug smuggler&#8221; or even &#8220;potential terrorist,&#8221; as well as accusations of refusing to learn English or assimilate.</p>
<p>Immigration reform advocates, particularly Latino activists, are falsely characterized as advocating &#8220;open borders&#8221; and &#8220;blanket amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>These comments constitute &#8220;hate speech,&#8221; as defined in a preliminary report on a pilot study conducted by UCLA&rsquo;s Chicano Studies Research Center.</p>
<p>Hate speech leads to hate crimes. No argument about that. {snip}</p>
<p>Based on this and other reports, the National Hispanic Media Coalition has filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine the extent, nature and effects of hate speech, the role of the media and possible options to counterbalance its negative impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hate speech should have no place in a nation of immigrants that pays a lot of lip service to its racial and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Neither should other kinds of speech that, though perhaps not be categorized as &#8220;hate speech,&#8221; certainly qualify as &#8220;ignorant speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The aforementioned Mr. Epstein, writing in an anti-immigration blog and quoted in a recent New York Times editorial, said: &#8220;Diversity can be good in moderation  &mdash;  if what&rsquo;s brought in is desirable. Most Americans don&rsquo;t mind a little ethnic food, some Asian math whizzes or a few mariachi dancers  &mdash;  as long as these trends do not overwhelm the dominant culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Epstein, assimilate this: There&rsquo;s no one American &#8220;dominant&#8221; culture. {snip}</p>

								<h2><h2>What Marcus Epstein Really Said</h2></h2>
						<p>&#8220;My basic point was merely that a white vote is just as important as a Hispanic vote, [VDARE.com note: actually far more important.] and that no thanks to current immigration trends, whites still make up 13 times more of the electorate than Hispanics. Therefore, it is stupid to alienate millions of white voters with a pro-Amnesty Martinez with the hope of gaining a few extra points of the Hispanic Vote.&#8221;</p>

			<p>All talk, both parties.  Nothing but.  They have no intention of attempting to close our borders, none whatsoever.  It&rsquo;s just talk, nothing more.  We just got through a Presidential campaign and one of the most important topics, if not the most important topic for a campaign for the Presidency was totally ignored by both candidates.</p>
<p>They talk about alienating millions of White voters??  Who did these White voters vote for?  Either one of two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>A Hispanic writer from New York City writing about &#8220;Hate speech leads to Hate Crimes??  The vast majority of hate crimes are perpetrated by Blacks and Hispanics on Whites.  Everything seems to be in reverse here.  Black is White and White is Black.  Up is down and down is up.  We are truly through the &#8216;looking glass&rsquo; here.</p>

			<p>Dolores Prida,Recoquista Queen, if you want speech that you consider to be hate speech banned,then start a campaign to pass a constitutional amendment repealing the First Amendmant.I would like to see how far you get with that.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;argue that pandering to pro-amnesty Latino voters is not the way to go forward.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I agree. It isn&rsquo;t the way to go forward.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has been hijacked by the notion of the Cuban-American. When Reagan got tough with Castro, there was a surge in Cuban votes in Florida. It is primarily this model that the Republicans have used as their argument to go after the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p>But this is one small group on one issue. As I understand it, the children of Cubans haven&rsquo;t supported Republicans and support for Republicans in general by Cubans has fallen below 50% and continues to drop. So much for an Hispanic strategy.</p>
<p>Promising, or worse, delivery amnesty would only cause a temporary rise in Hispanic votes for Republics. In the long run, their children will be brainwashed by the same &#8216;Republicans are racist&rsquo; rhetoric. It&rsquo;s a short term gain for a long term disaster.</p>
<p>What turns me off and others to supporting Republicans is the way they pander to Hispanics. If Hispanics want to support Republican, they should do so by supporting Republican ideals.<br>

			<p>   Democrats/Republicans; there is no difference other than the spelling. Both are Hell-bent on the destruction of this country. Neither party cares about white people or what they think. The only way to save our country is start a party along the lines of the British National Party. A strong nationalist party is the only answer and hope to combat the two criminal parties in power now. Without it, hope is lost. Democrats and republicans alike would throw their own families into the flames of Hell to stay in power. There is no pride or integrity in those two parties. They are both criminal organizations. Amerika, without divine intervention of some sort, is dead. We must build a strong nationalist party NOW, or lose everything.</p>

<p>Oh, how I wish the Republicans would heed this advice - just once.  Then at least White America will have the chance to make a responsible choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;To their ears, the words &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; are usually followed or preceded by adjectives such as &ldquo;criminal,&rdquo; &ldquo;illegal,&rdquo; &ldquo;drug smuggler&rdquo; or even &ldquo;potential terrorist,&rdquo; as well as accusations of refusing to learn English or assimilate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sort of like cigarettes being associated with bronchitis, COPD, and lung cancer?  Maybe Phillip Morris should sue Google for hate speech, since not everyone who enjoys the occasional cigarette becomes ill or dies young.  My Great-Aunt is 90 and she still smokes - and she sounds terrific for a women her age.  Are the studies done on the harmful effects of illegal immigration any less reliable than those done on smoking?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity can be good in moderation &mdash; if what&rsquo;s brought in is desirable. Most Americans don&rsquo;t mind a little ethnic food, some Asian math whizzes or a few mariachi dancers &mdash; as long as these trends do not overwhelm the dominant culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can anyone apart from Hispanics and Liberal nutjobs be genuinely outraged by this?  I&rsquo;m not even a conservative, and I agree with this.  This statement is about as moderate and mainstream as you can find.  And somehow this is &#8220;hate speech&#8221; that nobody may say in public without fear of tarnishing their reputation or worse?  Something is wrong here.</p>

<p>The familiar irony: &#8220;diversity&#8221; demands censorship and intellectual conformity. The US also pays lip service to &#8220;democracy;&#8221; aren&rsquo;t citizens of a democracy supposed to express their political views and vote in accord with them, even if mestizos don&rsquo;t like their views and votes?</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate speech leads to hate crimes. No argument about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really? Then why can&rsquo;t these imbecile outfits point to a single real &#8220;hate crime&#8221; to make their case?</p>
<p>Note that not one assertion of the Epstein report is even challenged here. We&rsquo;re merely told that it&rsquo;s wrong, for mostly unspecified reasons, to oppose the current third-world invasion.</p>

			<p><i>The larger pool of white voters they&rsquo;re after get, in sizable numbers, their world view from conservative talk radio and Internet publications, where hate-mongering thrives, <b>unchecked and unchallenged</b>.</i></p>
<p>THIS IS LIBERAL CODE.  A normal person reads this and fills in the blanks with the incorrect assumption that the author wants liberals to debate/denounce &#8220;hate-mongers.&#8221;  No, what the code means is that men in black robes must use force of government to &#8220;check&#8221; and &#8220;challenge&#8221; dissent by outlawing it.</p>
<p>How do I know?  Because liberals do everything they possibly can to avoid debate and discussion with &#8220;hate-mongers.&#8221;  They like to tell themselves they&rsquo;re open-minded, but that&rsquo;s just a cozy lie.  It&rsquo;s just as believable as anything chanted by a crowd in North Korea.</p>
<p>I wish liberals would come swarming all over us for debate and discussion.  It&rsquo;d be wonderful; I can&rsquo;t get them to even start a conversation without them reaching for their favorite tool, the ban/delete button.  We&rsquo;d send half of them home &#8220;hate-mongers,&#8221; and leave the other half hiding under their beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unchecked and unchallenged&#8221;.  Pfah!  It is to laugh.  I&rsquo;m begging you guys, please come and check/challenge us.  Get ready to lose.  You&rsquo;re intellectual lightweights and nothing more than finger food.  </p>

<p>Well, seeing as the &#8220;base voters&#8221; for the Republican Party <i>are</i> (were) whites&hellip;</p>
<p><i>Driving immigrants out and sealing the border are the best arguments to win future elections, according to the report &ldquo;Immigration and the 2008 Republican Defeat,&rdquo; also discussed at the Washington gathering, issued by the group American Cause and authored by Marcus Epstein.</i></p>

<p><i>The larger pool of white voters they&rsquo;re after get, in sizable numbers, their world view from conservative talk radio and Internet publications, where hate-mongering thrives, unchecked and unchallenged.</i></p>
<p>Yes:<br>
Can&rsquo;t let us nasty &#8220;racists&#8221; give other whites views that conflict with your own - here comes the &#8220;Fairness Doctrine&#8221;!</p>
<p><i>To their ears, the words &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; are usually followed or preceded by adjectives such as &ldquo;criminal,&rdquo; &ldquo;illegal,&rdquo; &ldquo;drug smuggler&rdquo; or even &ldquo;potential terrorist,&rdquo; as well as accusations of refusing to learn English or assimilate.</i></p>
<p>Well, where I&rsquo;m from we&rsquo;d call that statement <i>sticking your head in the sand</i>:<br>
It must be British/French/German/Polish immigrants to the United States clamouring for &#8220;recognition of Spanish&#8221; as a language, am I right?</p>
<p><i>Immigration reform advocates, particularly Latino activists, are falsely characterized as advocating &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; and &ldquo;blanket amnesty.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>These comments constitute &ldquo;hate speech,&rdquo; as defined in a preliminary report on a pilot study conducted by UCLA&rsquo;s Chicano Studies Research Center.</i></p>
<p>Expect the definition of what constitutes &#8220;hate speech&#8221; to expand to virtually any criticism of persons that aren&rsquo;t white, by a white person.<br>
But yes, I always go to the &#8220;Chicano Studies Research Center&#8221; to find out about &#8220;hate speech&#8221; by &#8220;anti-immigration activists&#8221; - no conflict of interest <i>there</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hate speech leads to hate crimes. No argument about that.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Crystal Magnum agrees too.</p>
<p><i>Hate speech should have no place in a nation of immigrants that pays a lot of lip service to its racial and cultural diversity.</i></p>
<p>This comes up a lot, <i>despite</i> the fact that - until the &rsquo;60s&rsquo;, and the &#8220;1965 Immigration Act&#8221; - immigration to America was almost-entirely comprised of white Europeans, and in the &rsquo;20s&rsquo; was almost-entirely comprised of Northern Europeans at that.</p>
<p><i>Neither should other kinds of speech that, though perhaps not be categorized as &ldquo;hate speech,&rdquo; certainly qualify as &ldquo;ignorant speech.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, if anyone disagrees with my statement about the expansion of what a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; is defined as&hellip;</p>
<p>That was some &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; journalism there, Ms. Prida (though I like the other story on VDare where a journalist for the New York Times attempted to get a VDare writer <i>fired</i> for disagreeing with her better).</p>

			<p>Pardon me, but didn&rsquo;t the New York Times already have this story?  I suppose Carlos Slim bought a share of the Daily News as well.</p>
<p>Peejay in Frisco:</p>
<p>I think I know what you&rsquo;re saying.  I think we all know the author of this article in the NYDN knows that there are no such things as &#8220;hate speech&#8221; laws, but s/he would like you to think they are, to grease the skids for there really to be such laws.</p>
<p>The popular media do it all the time   &mdash;   I wish I had a dime for everyone who thought that you have to register your guns, simply because so many TV crime dramas put on like you do.  There is not one jurisdiction in America that has formal registration requirement.  But the libs want registration, as a prelude to confiscation, which they also want.  So it&rsquo;s just fine and dandy if every TV show promulgates the notion that there is gun registration.  That way, when lib politician proposes it where there was none before, most people won&rsquo;t flinch.</p>

<p>Yes, there is. EVERY country has a dominant culture, a nation can&rsquo;t survive without one, for without one, you don&rsquo;t have a unified people,culture or country but just different balkanized tribes living on the same soil. The bottom line is the USA belongs to the American citizen, it is our home just as Mexico belongs to the Mexican citizen and Mexico is their home. In my home, I have the right to refuse anyone to enter for whatever reason. Same goes for the USA. Most American people don&rsquo;t want mass immigration, legal or illegal, and being that this is OUR home, we have the right to refuse immigration for any reason. Mexicans or other Latin American countries do not allow mass immigration and don&rsquo;t want it and neither do we.</p>

			<p>The tired ploy of racism and hate mongering is just used to silence legitamate debate. If Whites are hate mongers because they don&rsquo;t want mass immigration, than  mexicans and others must also be hate mongers and racist because mexico etc. has very strict anti-immgration policies. Mexico allows very little legal immigration and tolerates no illegal immigration.</p>

			<p>This person is right about one thing, the term &#8220;open borders&#8221; is not correct. What leftists, hispanic rabble rousers and the Mexican government want is a border that is only open one way and that is into America. The Mexican government will continue to enforce it&rsquo;s immigration laws. As for the term &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, this is just ridiculous. Hispanic rabble rousers want to tag anything that encourages the US to enforce it&rsquo;s immigration laws as &#8220;hate speech&#8221;.</p>

			<p>When they say anti-immigration is racist, it&rsquo;s just an admission that there must be a racial component to immigration itself and that immigration itself must be along racial lines, or in fact racist. </p>

			<p>We had a faculty inservice today and one of the topics was &#8220;Gang awareness&#8221; presented by our local police force.  <br>
I was already &#8220;aware&#8221; but the presentation was a wake up call for a majority of our faculty who have no clue.  There was video of Crips and Bloods with emphasis on the number of chapters and subdivisions across the country along with  MS13 ( one of the most violent groups around who engage in the beheading of potential witnesses), Gangsta Disciples, Latin Kings, Sureños, Norteños and a host of other street gangs including some Asian ones.  There was frightening  surveillance camera footage of the shooting of two police officers by an Hispanic Marine in California who had enlisted in the Corps in order to get the free military training. Images from Iraq and Afghanistan showing gang grafitti on walls and military vehicles attested to the alarming number of gang members who are in our armed forces including the Navy and USAF.<br>
The entire presentation lasted a little more than an hour, ninety percent of which was taken up by an endless parade of Blacks and Hispanics. There was also footage depicting the number of &#8220;celebrities&#8221; like Snoop Dog, Ice Cube, Shoog Night and a host of others.  There were professional and college athletes many of whom openly displayed gang tats and flags while wearing their uniforms. The faculty was shocked to learn the number of gangs operating in our Township and all over New Jersey including beautiful, Victorian Cape May. There were also pictures of students in our elementary schools displaying gang signs. Of course there was the obligatory mention of Skinheads and Neo- Nazis operating in and around the Atlantic City area but that whole segment amounted to less than five minutes. I think that most people got their education today as to what constitutes the greatest threat to our future and at one point the police officers stated that &#8220;They aren&rsquo;t afraid of us.&#8221; <br>
I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder about the years and resources spent crushing La Cosa Nostra who, in comparison to these mutants, were a &#8220;gentleman&rsquo;s club&#8221;.<br>
It was very sobering to the majority of the faculty especially when the police acknowledged that they were at a serious disadvantage both in manpower and in weaponry.</p>

			<p>Anyone else notice that the way Prida talks about white Americans, about republicans, and about conservatives exactly fits her loose definition of hate speech?  I mean, if associating something negative, say crime, with Latinos is hate speech, then what, exactly, is it when you say conservative whites are the cause of violent crimes? (paragraphs 6-9).  At this point everything she accuses whites and especially conservatives of, is, in fact, what virtually every minority/liberal/leftist group is guilty of with reference to the white populace of this country (and anybody who disagrees with them).</p>

Posted by KC</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. And it&rsquo;s the height of hypocrisy for Mexicans to be demanding entry into the USA, when at the same time they have very strict laws virtually prohibiting immigration into Mexico.</p>
<p>In other words, they want our door to be wide open while their dor is closed and locked shut. </p>

<p>Yes, there is. EVERY country has a dominant culture, a nation can&rsquo;t survive without one, for without one, you don&rsquo;t have a unified people,culture or country but just different balkanized tribes living on the same soil. <br>

<p>The Globalists want to destroy the dominant culture of every country. In Turkey, they are trying to undermine the secular, nationalist Turkish Republic, and replace it with an Islamist, non-nationalist (globalist), Kurdish or other minority dominated, Balkanized country. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen how Iraq has been Balkanized under the US forces, who are the de facto shocktroops of the Globalists.</p>
<p>Globalism is against nationalism of any kind and for one world, non-nationalist, &#8220;we are all one in the Ummah/Body of Christ&#8221; type Borg-like administration. That&rsquo;s why they love Islam so much, it&rsquo;s anti-nationalist. (well it&rsquo;s pro-Arab nationalist, but that&rsquo;s conveniently overlooked)</p>

			<p>Anyone advocating an immigration policy that over time will reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority is guilty of hate speech.</p>
<p>Deloes Prida, tell us what you think of this :Hispanics because they breed at an incredibly high rate within the borders of  America-a nation founded by Europeans and with a Native Born White majority- contribute significantly to the population explosion in the US at  time when thousands of animal and plant  species are endangered. The obvious conclusion is that high fertility Hispanic immigrants pose a very significant threat to America&rsquo;s wildlife and biodiversity in general.</p>
<p>Do you like this Delores Prida? Maybe you like Mario Obledo&rsquo;s quote:&#8221;The last gasp of White America.&#8221; For some reason, I don&rsquo;t think Mario Obledo will ever have his right to free speech crimnalized.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of heresy for all thinkers&hellip;</p>
<p>We, that is America, DOES NOT NEED any more immigrants! Because there simply are not that many available jobs. Proof of which are those &#8220;hiring points&#8221; found on certain street corners and parking lots in every city and town with even a smathering of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Most illegal immigrants are simply not interested in learning OUR language, adapting to OUR culture. Why? Because they simply see America to be used&hellip; for their benefit. Their loyalty is and always will be with Mexico.</p>
<p>Most immigrants, thanks to the all-pervasive crime culture, the &#8220;anything goes&#8221; mentality pervading the Mexican population&hellip; see nothing wrong with pulling off the occasional theft, burglary or car break-in. Kind of like, &#8220;If no one gets hurt, what&rsquo;ts the big deal about a little stealing, right?&#8221; Nor do Mexicans have any qualms about rape, even child molestation. Witness those all-too-numerous stories of Mexican rapists, Mexican pedophiles in our local news here in Houston. (Unless those foul perps are White men careful to masquerade as Mexicans and adopt Mexican names. But then why so often the tag line on CRIMESTOPPER segments&hellip; &#8220;Believed to have fled back to Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe La Raza and its clones would also like to DEMAND that no perps who are of Hispanic background&hellip; be described or shown in connection with a crime? I can recall a Mexican spokeman interviewed in Calif. by NPR Radio some years back. The gentleman was ranting and railing at the media for &#8220;spotlighting all those Mexican criminals.&#8221; It never occurred to him, the media would not spotlight those Mexican criminals if they were not indeed Mexicans AND criminals. His attitude throughout the interview seemed to say: &#8220;Sure, we Mexicans commit a lot of crimes. But why do you have to tell the world about it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they keep calling it immigration in past centuries when millions of people moved from one country to the other and refused to assimilate it was called colonization. </p>
<p>Most of North American history is one of colonization rather than immigration. If we had been immigrants we would have adopted the culture of the natives. People didn&rsquo;t immigrate to the American west they colonized the territory and pretty much drove out the original inhabitants much like what&rsquo;s happening today. This time it&rsquo;s white Europeans that are being replaced. </p>
<p>Immigration is nothing more these days than colonization by deception. If you had an english speaking colony in China they would know the difference. </p>

Wars of aggression can be waged in many ways. They are not always out in the open.  In the struggle for power and territory, there are many strategies.    </p>
<p>The accusation of &#8220;racism&#8221; is merely an effective ploy for disarming their victim   &mdash;    which is YOU!   It&rsquo;s an ultimatum that you must give up and submit.  You must cease your resistance and allow then to do anything they want. You must back down and let them invade your territory.  It&rsquo;s just their strategy for shutting you up  and silencing all opposition to their take-over.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Immigration reform advocates, particularly Latino activists, are falsely characterized as advocating &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; and &ldquo;blanket amnesty.&rdquo; These comments constitute &ldquo;hate speech,&rdquo; as defined in a preliminary report on a pilot study conducted by UCLA&rsquo;s Chicano Studies Research Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we have free political opinions spuriously characterized as hate speech&hellip;. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the National Hispanic Media Coalition has filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission, asking it to examine the extent, nature and effects of [this kind of] hate speech, the role of the media and possible options to counterbalance its negative impact.&#8221;</p>

<p>The UCLA Chicano Center thinks criticizing illegal aliens is hate speech?  What a surprise!  I can&rsquo;t imagine how a California far left elitist institution&rsquo;s &#8220;Chicano&#8221; center would come up with an idea like this.  I&rsquo;m sure they are equally outraged when people criticize whites, and I&rsquo;m sure the professors from this institution praise white people and America in their classes.</p>
<p>Finally, if America has no dominant culture how come every one of the Founders was white and up until the 1950&rsquo;s 90% of Americans were white?</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have to give the author some credit for not labeling Epstein a &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221;, as New York Times did recently. It was totally laughable since Epstein is of Korean/Jewish descent. (I think the article was posted on this site too?)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to see how the major players in the MSM have come around to embrace this point of view, which now seems to have become the official Establishment Point of View. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Wall street Journal&hellip;. all unanimously concur on this matter. </p>
<p>I can remember when, 30 years ago (maybe even 20), this point of view was what you would come across in small, radical, left-wing publications and outright Communist newspapers, the sort you might find being distributed on campuses    &mdash;   but NOT in the major press.  Now, it is!  Suddenly, it&rsquo;s everywhere.  It&rsquo;s now regarded as the only acceptable point of view. And if you don&rsquo;t agree with it, you&rsquo;re an out-of-touch,  far-right, racist wacko.  You deserve nothing but contempt and need to be silenced.</p>
<p>What has happened?  Is it because those old-time campus hippies have grown up and are now in charge?</p>
<p>Whatever happened, it appears that the inmates have taken over the asylum and are now running it.</p>
