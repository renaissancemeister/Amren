			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Federation for American Immigration Reform, FAIR Legislative Update, February 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This week, as a guest on a Spanish language radio show, President Obama stated his continued support for giving amnesty to 12 million illegal immigrants, which would force Americans looking for a job to compete with amnestied aliens for work. (El Piolin Interview, February 18, 2009 and CBS4  &mdash;  South Florida).</p>
<p>During the radio interview, President Obama said: &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to start by really trying to work on how to improve the current [immigration] system so that people who want to be naturalized, who want to become citizens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are able to do it; that it&rsquo;s cheaper, that it&rsquo;s faster, that they have an easier time in terms of sponsoring family members.&#8221; Following that, President Obama acknowledged what legal American workers already know intuitively  &mdash;  that amnesty is not in their best interest  &mdash;  but then endorsed amnesty anyway. President Obama said: &#8220;And then we&rsquo;ve got to have comprehensive immigration reform.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Politically it&rsquo;s going to be tough. It&rsquo;s probably tougher now than it was, partly because of the fact that the economy has gotten worse.&#8221; (El Piolin).</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, over 11.6 million Americans are currently unemployed and the number of unemployed Americans has increased by 4.1 million over the past year. (Bureau of Labor Statistics, January 2009). Millions more have simply stopped looking for work. Just last month, 598,000 Americans lost their jobs. Particularly troubling among the unemployment data is the fact that certain minorities such as African-Americans are experiencing greater unemployment (12.6 percent) than the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>President Obama also said his staff was working on amnesty already, stating: &#8220;we&rsquo;ve got some wonderful people on my White House staff who are working on this issue on an ongoing basis.&#8221; Earlier this week, open-borders advocates suggested that they expect that Congress will debate amnesty legislation in the fall of 2009. (NDN, February 20, 2009). Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid&rsquo;s director of Hispanic media has confirmed the likely timing for debate as well. (O Jornal, January 30, 2009).<br/>

			<p>In Obama&rsquo;s mind and the Democrats&rsquo; minds, the economy doesn&rsquo;t matter.  All that matters is more Democrat votes, that will always vote Democrat no matter the state of the economy.  Any amnesty bill will probably make such voters the majority in the country.</p>

			<p>There you have it. Obama, The President and leader of the administration of &#8220;Change&#8221;, is talking with and promising amnesty to a guy, who advocates and instigates illegal immmigration on the radio, and was himself an illegal alien, before the &#8220;great&#8221; Ronald Reagan gave him and other border criminals, amnesty. We have not had an honest administration against illegal immigration for at least 40 or more years. Obama and the Democrats are going to round out that forty years of treason with another amnesty, the biggest ever.</p>

			<p>Illegal immigration is Economic Genocide against low-skilled African Americans.  </p>
<p>Currently only about 1/2 of African-Americans finish high school, and relatively few graduate from college.  This means that there are millions and millions of under-educated African Americans who can only find work in low-skilled, non-professional jobs.  But these jobs do not pay a living wage, because there are millions of poor and desperate illegal aliens from Mexico, who will work for virtually nothing, and hence drive down salaries.  Why would anyone hire an African-American at $15/hr, when they can hire an immigrant at $7/hr?  The surest way to keep USA Blacks unemployed is to bring in an endless supply of Mexican wage slaves.  </p>
<p>Imagine if all the illegals were suddenly sent home.  Agricultural, construction, meat-plants, carpet mills, restaurants, hotels, factories, custodial services, landscaping business, etc. by the thousands would now be desperate to hire people, and at nearly any cost.  Salaries for low-skilled workers would skyrocket, allowing even high school dropouts to earn a good wage.  </p>
<p>The millions of Black kids who fail to graduate from high school are healthy, energetic, strong, and can work, if given a livable salary.  However Obama would rather keep millions of African-Americans unemployed for life than protect our borders.  Obama loves Mexicans more than American citizens. Obama&rsquo;s change: JOBS FOR MEXICANS   &mdash;   UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS!</p>

			<p>An absurd thought just hit me viewing today&rsquo;s immigrant related posts and other Afro related postings here. That is, on the one hand blacks and their white liberal supporters keep describing the US as such a historically (and currently) hotbed of hatred and racism and all sorts of horribleness. On the other hand it seems the rest of the world all wants to be here from poor lowly skilled Mexicans to supposedly braniac Asians(and the same liberal pieces of trash wish they could all be here). Isn&rsquo;t there a contradiction somewhere? </p>
<p>In regard to this article, Obamalama is just a phony politician Hispandering. He would rather get re-elected than stop the current economic malaise.<br/>

			<p>St. Obama is going to take us to the precipice.  Instead of having these illegals deported, he&rsquo;s going to welcome them into society.  &#8216;Here take some more of our jobs.  You want welfare?  Sure.  No problem.  You want social services?  Sure, the White man &#8216;ll just foot the bill.  Oh and by the way, We really have to start having some frank discussions on race.  Can&rsquo;t you see &#8220;Americans (White) are cowards&#8221;?</p>

			<p>I am absolutely flabberghasted that this man is so arrogant to go forward with this.   Who was it, John PM, who always said, worse is better?  At what point do we need to get before the pendulum swings back over to the right?  What is going to be the straw to break the camel&rsquo;s back? Are all these obama-lovers seeing what their messiah is doing to them?  And did anyone notice ophra&rsquo;s letting her true feelings show through since her candidate got in?  Don&rsquo;t all her loyal stupid white women followers see that she is a seething, arrogant racist under a false front?   Every white person I talk to, behind closed doors of course, is fed up, and a good thing has come about because now more are becoming brave enough to speak out and finding that we all feel the same.  </p>

			<p>RE: Anonymous at 6:30 PM </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to defend the interests of third world wage helots in this country (and there are plenty of them from landscapers to IT professionals) or their greedy employers. But the fact of the matter is, that as a group, Blacks have long lost whatever work ethic they may have had in the past and the capacity to be productive in this nation no matter what salary level they are employed at. I&rsquo;d be hard put to organize a day&rsquo;s safe, simple, measurable and honorable labor and employ a black youf to do it at $15.00 per hour cash tax free in a way that would yield an economic benefit that exceeded the cost of supervision and exposure to crime and lawsuits.</p>

			<p>Lately, I have taken anecdotal notice of a curious thing in my small Southern city:  The Obama for President bumper stickers are rapidly disappearing from the cars in my town. (75 per cent White, 14 per cent Black, 10 per cent mostly IA or anchor baby Hispanic, and 1 per cent other)  &mdash;    &mdash;   Buyer&rsquo;s remorse?? </p>
<p>Tip from Yankee Household Fix It Guide:  To remove stubborn adhesive residues from stickers, apply mayonnaise to affected area and allow to stand for 30 minutes before scrubbing with plastic fiber pad. Repeat if neccessary. The acetic acid laden gel dissolves most gummy adhesive compounds found on bumper stickers.</p>

			<p>Whatever. Our government won&rsquo;t enforce the borders, you can&rsquo;t make a living wage with unskilled labor. Hey, that&rsquo;s just the start of our problems. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re heading towards collapse. It&rsquo;s time to plan, prepare, keep cool, and group up with reliable people who see this coming. </p>

			<p>more and more immigrants mean more and more democratic voters, ending in a one party system, turning obama into a dictator because the constitution will be suspended and a david axelrod led administration will increase hate crime legislation to include thought, will eliminate our guns, increase our taxes to about 90 percent and have constant money flowing to blacks, and eliminate taxes for blacks, and then they can complete their grand plan of revenge on white people for slavery, the driving force behind all of this. am i the only one that sees this?</p>

			<p>As a Spanish guy from Puerto Rico living in mainland USA - it seems hypocritical for Obama and all the other presidents to give amnesty and &#8220;rights&#8221; to illegals when Puerto Ricans, who, by the way, are AMERICAN CITIZENS also are displaced by illegals.</p>
<p>In addtion, my wife is a white born-in-America woman who was displaced by African-Americans for administrative assistant work for years.  Now that the African-Americans are being displaced by illegals, we hear about it.  My wife is caught in a trap.  Has a BA, can&rsquo;t afford to get an MA or MFA because of student loan bills and so is displaced, overqualified, underqualified, not able to get rewards of affirmative action - basically unemployable.  And so am I.</p>
<p>Nice country.  Keep the illegals out.  California is bankrupt because of the how many billions spent on illegals?</p>

			<p>Time to forget all this stuff and work on protecting our immediate families. We need to talk about ways to insure we provide food, shelter, transportation, and security for ourselves and our families in a radically different world, and that we work with like minded folks in our immediate region to meet those goals, locally. </p>

			<p>We haven&rsquo;t had a President who believes in enforcing immigration law since Eisenhower.  Unfortunately, with Democratic majorities in both houses Obama will almost certainly get his amnesty.  We&rsquo;re doomed.</p>

			<p>Amnesty won&rsquo;t happen (except in the Bush-style, &#8220;don&rsquo;t enforce the laws&#8221; sense). Obama&rsquo;s stock is already falling. The economy is still sick and, alleged improvements aside, the dominos are still falling all over the world, especially in Europe. It may stop getting worse - possibly, maybe, though not likely - but it won&rsquo;t get <i>better</i> anytime in the near future. People are fed up with his porkulus bill. They&rsquo;re fed up with the kleptocracy this administration is becoming. Tea Parties are popping up all over the place. If he pushes amnesty then the wheels will really fall off. There are 435 House members up for re-election every two years and enough of them are smart enough to know that an amnesty can&rsquo;t pay off at the ballot box quickly enought to save their hides. If an amnesty happens at a time of high and rising unemployment <i>there will be riots</i> and <i>I will be there</i>.</p>

			<p>Amnesty will never happen.  America is facing an economic crisis of epic proportions, millions are becoming unemployed, states (especially sanctuary states) are flat broke, and we&rsquo;re drowning in debt&hellip;  </p>
<p>Obama can &#8220;say&#8221; all he wants to &#8220;please&#8221; the open-border mob, but he knows only too well that he and his Democratic party could never get away with this!</p>
<p>Anti-Illegal Alien groups such as NumbersUSA, FAIR, CIIS and CAPS are joining up; and this bigger and better coalition has just put out not one, but two great commercials all over CNN and FOX concerning our traitorous government, wide open borders and our never-ending onslaught of legal and illegal immigration.  </p>
<p>Our patriotic groups are growing and getting stronger by the day&hellip;</p>

			<p>  This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least. Both McCain and Obama, being certified members of our privileged liberal elite, are rabid supporters of shamnasty. Their belief in open borders is almost a religious conviction. They are social engineers who want to remake America into a multicultural socialist/corporatist wage slave paradise.  In other words, transform America into a grim Soviet-style Brazil  &mdash;  a politically correct Brazil without the fun.</p>

			<p>This will come as a surprise to many Americans, but Mexicans actually have their own country.  It&rsquo;s called Mexico, and it is a large country sitting just to the south of the USA.  It is a land exceedingly rich in natural resources, including rich soils, valuable ores, plentiful fisheries, oil, and, in the south, abundant rain, hydroelectric potential, and timber. From north Mexico to south Mexico, and to the higher elevations, virtually any crop known to man can be grown.  With its scenic beauty, charming colonial cities, sunny beaches, tasty food, and fascinating archeological ruins, Mexico should be rich just from tourism alone.  Mexico also has a young and sizable workforce, that will work long hours at low pay.  There is absolutely no need for Mexicans to sneak into the USA to steal our jobs. The idea that the USA somehow has an obligation to import Mexicans is ludicrous.  </p>

			<p>As if we don&rsquo;t have enough desperate people, Obama wants to legalize more.  These will be his voters in 2012.  If Republicans want to make a come-back, not that they were ever really here on immigration, they should be calling for the expulsion of illigals now, while they have the ecconomy to justify thinning the workforce.</p>

Your exactly right.  Obama and the rest of our government bureaucrats and &#8220;elected&#8221; officials are on top. They are making money and doing well.  They only need to bleed taxpayers and run up more debt to try and faux fix our current economic problems in an attempt to fool the American public into believing that they are really trying to do something about it.  Doing something about our current problem would require some serious evaluation and decision making.  It would require massive spending cuts and their are far too many people made happy in the private and public sector by that spending.  No the clown with the big ears in office right now isn&rsquo;t going to do a damn thing about the root of our economic crisis.  Not that John McCain would have either.  These top guys are beholden to the interests that contribute heavily to the mess were in right now. The whole election farce is fixed so that only these sort of career establishment shills will ever be &#8220;elected&#8221; into these top positions of power. The answer is going to progressively be more price fixing and inflation and higher taxes. The people at the top arent about to pay for their mistakes and neither are their friends.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t your White Anglo wife have your last name &#8220;Rivera&#8221;? </p>
<p>I suggest you to get her to learn just some Spanish, dress and act hostile, with a chip on her shoulder and talk a lot about &#8220;My People&#8221;.</p>
<p>She should qualify very well for affirmative action and plus business will prefer to hire/keep her as she is healthy, smart, competent (White).</p>

			<p>The 6:30 pm poster (above) who points out that Mexico is incredibly rich in natural and cultural resources is correct.  However, for some reason, Mexico remains mired in poverty, crime, underdevelopment and misery.  I say that now is the time to mount a full-fledged program to SAVE MEXICO.  How can we SAVE MEXICO, you ask?  This can best be done through massive person-to-person assistance   &mdash;   an &#8220;Amigo Corp&#8221; if you will.  These Amigos (helpers) need to speak Spanish, understand Hispanic culture, and like Mexican food.  Who best fits these requirements?  The 40 million Mexicans currently living in the USA.  After all, Mexican-Americans already know Spanish and are comfortable with Mexican culture.  They have been given the best education, health care, and diet that American Taxpayers can afford.  Best of all is that they have strong family values and are ready to do jobs that Mexicans won&rsquo;t do.  Mexican-Americans seem like the perfect group to SAVE MEXICO!  </p>
<p>Please urge your congressman to support Amigo Corp, with the goal of moving 40 million Amigos from the USA to Mexico.  Yes We Can!  Together we can SAVE MEXICO!</p>
<p>Later, we can use the same methods to save Nicaragua, Guatemala, Haiti, Nigeria, India, China, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Somalia, Ethiopia, etc.  I realize that this will harm the USA by decreasing our diversity, but that&rsquo;s a sacrifice that we will have to make.  We need to think of others for a change.  It is not fair that America gets all the diversity. There is serious under-diversity in many countries, and the least we can do is share some of ours with the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>I see a lot of comments on here about the Democratic Party pushing the treason of amnesty in order to create a &#8220;permanent Democratic majority&#8221;. As much as reading that makes me cringe, I have to admit that it must be true. There can be no other reason for their insane behavior. </p>
<p>I brought this up to a local bigwig in the Dem party who has run for office many times, and he got real defensive and starting going on and on about the Republicans bringing all these reactionary Cuban nuts over here. Point taken, but he changed the subject. </p>
<p>Then he launched into this thing about, &#8220;If we don&rsquo;t let them invade by the millions, they will have a revolution in Mexico. Then they will bring their revolution up here.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think they will have a revolution down there, but they surely need one, and as a revolutionary, I hope they start one. This has to be one of the dumbest arguments of all. We need to allow the SW US (and I guess the rest of the country) to be turned into Tijuana North to stave off Pancho Villa II.</p>
<p>The fact that my political party would willingly ruin this great country just for a shot at &#8220;permanent majority&#8221; makes me want to run to the bathroom and vomit. No prize is worth destroying the country.</p>
<p>I wish there was a (citizenist) nationalist party around to support.</p>
<p>The point above about Hispanics being the worst enemies of Blacks is great. Of course the Black elite has sold out US Blacks. Unlike many on here, I support pro-Black Blacks. Course I think Whites should be allowed to be pro-White too. Everyone should support their people, unless it&rsquo;s treasonous to do so. This is where I draw the line at Latino pols. When it comes down to Americans versus (Latino) foreigners, they always side with the foreigners who are destroying our land against the Americans of any race. If that isn&rsquo;t treason, I don&rsquo;t know what is. Talk about dual loyalty!</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know what all the confusion and nonsense is all about. Everything is plainly clear. Obama is wanting to legalize millions of Mexicans(and illegal Hispanics as a whole) to ensure he gets re-elected in 2012 - along with the block-vote Blacks in 2012 election. It&rsquo;s pretty clear the Hispanics will block-vote him in in spite of the fact that Hispanics and Blacks as a whole HATE eachother. They perceive some advanatage for voting against the White guy to keep a White out - even if it means a government headed by someone whose race they despise. <br/>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I just got my tax bill and I am furious, furious, furious  &mdash;  and I believe in the next few years I&rsquo;ll be wishing I still had a &#8216;low tax bill of 2008.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The morons in the statehouse in California have just passed another massive tax bill  &mdash;  doubling the car tax, raising state taxes, raising the state income tax.  That would never drive businesses out of the state would it?  Taxpayers wouldn&rsquo;t flee to neighboring states would they?  A black market in car registration tags wouldn&rsquo;t arise, would it? (actually, it&rsquo;s already here, they&rsquo;re sold openly in downtown parks along with fake SS cards, fake driver&rsquo;s licenses, fake ID cards).</p>
<p>I have my pitchfork ready, do you? </p>

			<p>Funny how this radio interview did not feature on national news medias and was not mentioned during Obama&rsquo;s now famous Tuesday night speech.</p>
<p>That is just what I am worried about, while this administration proports to be helping Americans, all sorts of details will actually continue to disenfranchise White America to the point of not just powerlessness, but actual ejection from public life and then extinction.  After all, this was Obama&rsquo;s beloved White mother&rsquo;s dream.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m telling the white man here and now how to get it all back.</p>
<p>1.  Have more children<br/>
2.  Be activist and do not accept ever racism against us.<br/>
3.  Continual to tell illegals to go home.<br/>
4.  Organize and march.</p>
