			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nigel Morris, Independent (London), February 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National Party is on course to win its first seats in the European Parliament this year, Gordon Brown has been warned. Senior Labour figures have told the Prime Minister they believe two BNP candidates are likely to be sent to Brussels under the proportional representation system of voting, The Independent has learnt.</p>
<p>They fear Labour&rsquo;s campaign for the European election in June has been too slow to get off the ground and its lack of preparation is allowing the BNP to win over disaffected Labour voters.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the far-right party was celebrating a surprise win in a council by-election in Swanley, Kent, where the BNP candidate took 41 per cent of the vote after Labour&rsquo;s support collapsed.</p>
<p>It is the first time the BNP has won an election in a southern English county, and shows it is broadening its appeal beyond its traditional northern heartlands. The party also polled more than 28 per cent of the vote this week in a council by-election in Thringstone, Leicestershire  &mdash;  a seat it had never contested before.</p>
<p>Mr Brown has been told the BNP has a strong chance of fielding successful candidates in the North-west of England and Yorkshire and the Humber. A senior Labour source told The Independent yesterday: &#8220;We have got to get our act together  &mdash;  and very quickly. No one is focusing on the European elections; no one knows who is in charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night, the former minister Peter Hain warned that every political party was guilty of &#8220;complacency&#8221; over the threat posed by the BNP.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Everybody across the political spectrum  &mdash;  especially the Labour Party  &mdash;  has to prioritise beating the BNP with a vigorous strategy based on grassroots politics to win local trust and also making sure we deliver on affordable housing and deliver on jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is very fertile territory for [the BNP] now. When people are losing their jobs and there is an economic downturn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s heaven-made for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labour officials believe the BNP is well placed to attract support from the UK Independence Party, which won 16 per cent of the vote at the last European election, but has since imploded. They are also worried that disillusionment with the Government among traditional Labour voters will tempt them to support the BNP or not turn out at all.</p>
<p>The UK is divided into 12 regions for the European ballot, with voters asked to back parties rather than candidates. In practice, a party must win between 8 and 13 per cent of the total votes cast to have at least one representative picked from a list of nominees, depending on the size of the region.</p>
<p>In the North-west, where the BNP leader, Nick Griffin, is its main candidate, the party has to add only two or three percentage points to the 6.4 per cent of the vote it secured in 2004. In Yorkshire and Humber, where the BNP polled 8 per cent last time, it probably has to increase its support by three or four points.</p>
<p>Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP for Dagenham, who campaigns against the far-right group, acknowledged that conditions look better for the BNP now than they did five years ago, when it last came close to winning a seat.</p>
<p>Mr Cruddas said: &#8220;Five years ago, Ukip did very well and five years ago we had a benign economic environment. Now there is a global crisis. Everything else being equal, it&rsquo;s going to be tricky.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP&rsquo;s ability to spring surprises in previous no-go areas was underlined on Thursday during the ballot in Swanley St Mary&rsquo;s, which used to be a rare, Labour-leaning ward on the Tory-controlled Sevenoaks District Council. The BNP&rsquo;s Paul Golding captured it with a majority of 76 over Labour. The Tories finished third.</p>
<p>Mr Golding said afterwards: &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to put British people first on the housing queue. I&rsquo;ve had lots of complaints that foreigners and asylum-seekers are getting ahead of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Labour activist, Lesley Dyball, claimed that BNP supporters chanted &#8220;blacks out&#8221; after the result was declared at Swanley Town Hall. The BNP&rsquo;s victory at Swanley follows its near-miss last month in an election in the neighbouring London Borough of Bexley. Simon Darby, the deputy party leader, said it would mount a vigorous contest in the European elections, adding: &#8220;We are in place for 10 seats and we&rsquo;ve worked out if we can secure around 8 per cent of the vote we will take one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP threat will be highlighted today at a London rally organised by the group Unite Against Fascism (UAF). Speakers include Mr Hain, the former London mayor Ken Livingstone and Ennio Odino, a Holocaust survivor. The UAF secretary, Weyman Bennett, said: &#8220;Hitler used the economic crisis of the 1930s to gain a hearing for racists and murderous policies.&#8221;<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/feb/23/police-civil-unrest-recession">Britain Faces Summer of Rage &mdash; Police</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Paul Lewis, Guardian (Manchester), February 23, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Police are preparing for a &#8220;summer of rage&#8221; as victims of the economic downturn take to the streets to demonstrate against financial institutions, the Guardian has learned.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s most senior police officer with responsibility for public order raised the spectre of a return of the riots of the 1980s, with people who have lost their jobs, homes or savings becoming &#8220;footsoldiers&#8221; in a wave of potentially violent mass protests.</p>
<p>Superintendent David Hartshorn, who heads the Metropolitan police&rsquo;s public order branch, told the Guardian that middle-class individuals who would never have considered joining demonstrations may now seek to vent their anger through protests this year.</p>
<p>He said that banks, particularly those that still pay large bonuses despite receiving billions in taxpayer money, had become &#8220;viable targets&#8221;. So too had the headquarters of multinational companies and other financial institutions in the City which are being blamed for the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Hartshorn, who receives regular intelligence briefings on potential causes of civil unrest, said the mood at some demonstrations had changed recently, with activists increasingly &#8220;intent on coming on to the streets to create public disorder&#8221;.</p>
<p>The warning comes in the wake of often violent protests against the handling of the economy across Europe. In recent weeks Greek farmers have blocked roads over falling agricultural prices, a million workers in France joined demonstrations to demand greater protection for jobs and wages and Icelandic demonstrators have clashed with police in Reykjavik.</p>
<p>In the UK hundreds of oil refinery workers mounted wildcat strikes last month over the use of foreign workers.</p>
<p>Intelligence reports suggest that &#8220;known activists&#8221; are also returning to the streets, and police claim they will foment unrest. &#8220;Those people would be good at motivating people, but they haven&rsquo;t had the &#8216;footsoldiers&rsquo; to actually carry out [protests],&#8221; Hartshorn said. &#8220;Obviously the downturn in the economy, unemployment, repossessions, changes that. Suddenly there is the opportunity for people to mass protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that where we would possibly look at certain events and say, &#8216;yes there&rsquo;ll be a lot of people there, there&rsquo;ll be a lot of banner waving, but generally it will be peaceful&rsquo;, [now] we have to make sure these elements don&rsquo;t come out and hijack that event and turn that into disorder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hartshorn identified April&rsquo;s G20 meeting of the group of leading and developing nations in London as an event that could kick-start a challenging summer. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got G20 coming and I think that is being advertised on some of the sites as the highlight of what they see as a &#8216;summer of rage&rsquo;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments are likely to be met with disappointment by protest groups, who in recent weeks have complained that police are adopting a more confrontational approach at demonstrations. Officers have been accused of exaggerating the threat posed by activists to justify the use of resources spent on them.</p>
<p>Police were said to have been heavy-handed at Greek solidarity marches in London in December and, last month, at protests against Israel&rsquo;s invasion of Gaza. In August 1,000 officers, helicopters and riot horses were drafted to Kent from 26 UK police forces to oversee the climate camp demonstration against the Kingsnorth power station. The massive operation to monitor the protesters cost £5.9m and resulted in 100 arrests. But in December the government was forced to apologise to parliament after the Guardian revealed that its claims that 70 officers had been hurt in violent clashes were wrong.</p>
<p>However, Hartshorn insisted: &#8220;Potentially there will be more industrial actions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. History shows that some of those disputes  &mdash;  Wapping, the miners&rsquo; strike  &mdash;  have caused great tensions in the community and the police have had difficult times policing and maintaining law and order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both &#8220;extreme rightwing and extreme leftwing&#8221; elements are looking to &#8220;use the fact that people are out of jobs&#8221; to galvanise support, he said.</p>
<p>A particularly worrying development was the re-emergence of individuals involved in the violent fascist organisation Combat 18, he said. &#8220;They are using the fact that there&rsquo;s been lots of talk about eastern European people coming in and taking jobs on the Olympic sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re using those type of arguments to look at getting support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hartshorn said he also expected large-scale demonstrations this year on environmental issues, with hardcore green activists &#8220;joining forces&#8221; with middle-class campaigners over issues such as airport expansion at Heathrow and Stansted. With the prospect of angry demonstrations against the economy, that could open the door to powerful coalitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you&rsquo;ve got to do then is link in with the environmentalists, and look at the oil companies. They&rsquo;re seen to be turning over billions of pounds profit in issues that are seen to be against the environment.&#8221;<br>

			<p>This Peter Hain is conceited.  He has the humility, if you will, to claim that the only reason the BNP ever wins anything is that Labor is asleep at the wheel at the time.  Oh no, it&rsquo;s not possible that the BNP and its candidates are better at strategy and tactics, and outmaneuver their opponents, and they certainly don&rsquo;t have better ideas.  (Sarcasm).</p>
<p>The reality is that Labor has many many many more times the resources, liquid and intangible, than the BNP.  I bet in these elections where the BNP won or came razor-edge close, Labor outspent BNP by huge margins, plus media obsession.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not stated here is Tory prospects vis-a-vis BNP.  It seems that the conventional wisdom in the UK, based on what I read in the major Brit papers, is that the BNP would hurt Labor most acutely.  I&rsquo;m not sure that the Conservatives wouldn&rsquo;t lose just as much blood.</p>

			<p>The good times are coming! I feel rather like Che Guevara must have when he heard the first bombs falling in Guatemala in 1954: exhilarated at the prospect of sudden and dramatic popular radicalism. Unlike the Guatemalans of 1954, we must not meekly stand by and allow the opportunity for change to pass us by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for everyone who has lost his or her job because of the downturn in the economy, but in the long term I&rsquo;m sure it will be a benefit to them, by upsetting the corrupt and self-interested status quo. I had always thought our struggle would take decades, but it looks like a divinely-ordained economic decline has accelerated things!</p>
<p>The destruction of plutocratic capitalism is essential for our people&rsquo;s survival.</p>

<p><br>
Hey guys, that&rsquo;s pretty funny, the way you&rsquo;re already making excuses for losing an election that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet! And the excuse is that your campaign &#8220;has been too slow to get off the ground&#8221;? Hilarious! The Labour Party has fought campaigns for, what, over a century now, is it? And they&rsquo;re blaming &#8220;a lack of preparation&#8221; for their traditional white working-class voters abandoning them for the BNP? </p>
<p>Must be that dry British sense of humor I&rsquo;m always hearing about. </p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m way over on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean and even I know the reason the BNP is stealing Labour&rsquo;s lead is because the BNP is pro-Britain and the Labour Party is anti-Britain. </p>
<p>And the British people, you see, they LIKE Britain. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s normal to like your own country. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s NOT normal is letting into your country   &mdash;   and, worse, giving preferential treatment to   &mdash;   unassimilating and frequently HOSTILE Third World hordes. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s HATING your own country. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Labour&rsquo;s gonna take a pounding in the upcoming EUro elections. This should be a major turning point   &mdash;   maybe THE turning point   &mdash;   in the thrilling forward march of the BNP. </p>
<p>One more thing&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;A Labour activist, Lesley Dyball, claimed that BNP supporters chanted &ldquo;blacks out&rdquo; after the result was declared at Swanley Town Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
And so what if they did? Those words aren&rsquo;t illegal yet, are they? </p>

			<p>The BNP is showing the way for us in the USA. They know how to defend the native people of England the right way.  </p>
<p>The smears from the creeps against the BNP are backfiring and the BNP isn&rsquo;t getting weaker. It&rsquo;s staying true to its principles; is wonderfully un-diverse and is gaining strength every time the creeps make a big deal about the party.</p>
<p>The BNP should probably pay the anti-white creeps who are attacking the party, because they&rsquo;re giving the BNP millions of dollars of free publicity.</p>

			<p>Well, to coin a phrase, &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t that special?&#8221;. Here at the same to we see article puffing about the supposed benefits of diversity, we see the British left all in a frenzy because some &#8220;entity&#8221; that has a truly diverse opinion from them might actually gain a voice. It is illuminating. A constant drumbeat of diversity can never hide their shallow fear of truth&hellip;<br>

			<p>The economic situation is deteriorating every day, and there&rsquo;s much devestating news coming out of Eastern Europe that the Ukraine is ready to completely collapse, taking down the other countries of Eastern Europe, which, many are saying, will in itself cause a global meltdown, obviously causing much discontent.</p>
<p>https://www.counterpunch.org/whitney02172009.html</p>
<p>And this discontent will increase&hellip;or maybe the correct word is &#8220;explode&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.as people can&rsquo;t find work and are in bitter competition with the third world hordes that were brought in as part of the population making up what was to be the rainbow utopia.</p>
<p>People will then be able to see up close and personal what the BNP has been talking about for a long time now, and, except for the fools and deadheads, they&rsquo;re apt to wind up as being the most populous party in the UK, with other right leaning parties in other countries enjoying the same boost. </p>
<p>Once whites lose their comfortable positions, they&rsquo;re going to be ready to rumble worldwide, finally.  But it will take a drastic action to get some of them to move off the couch, but, as it apears now, that&rsquo;s exactly what is going to happen. </p>

			<p>Every European has a white nationalist party and are successful with far less freedom of speech than we do here. White America needs to get our act togethor in the next couple of years. We need to get Amren, Cofcc, national alliance and all other splintered white nationlaist groups to form an American National Party headed by a well known activist like a David Duke. If we don&rsquo;t do this soon it&rsquo;s checkmate!!!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure the economy is only part of the reason the BNP is gaining in popularity. I think a large part has to do with the fact that their current &#8220;leaders&#8221; are giving away their country AND culture to foreigners-namely blacks and muslims, while putting a muzzle on the REAL British. As the article stated, they yelled &#8220;blacks out&#8221; not &#8220;give us jobs&#8221;.And after the treatment we received by Bush, and the fact we now have a &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; chairman of the RNC, they have lost me for good. We need a BNP in this country- - NOW!!!</p>

			<p>I find this article very interesting in that it seems to have been writen with very close attention the Agitprop style book.  Notice that the prospect of BNP winning anything is decidedly negative, but there is no explanation of why.  Likewise there is absolutely nothing about BNP political beliefs, only that they ultra-right and could not possibly have any appeal to anyone.  Did Patrice Lumumba University move the UK?</p>

			<p>The BNP knows how to have a racially aware party and do it right so that it&rsquo;s not seen as too extremist (except by anti-white kooks).</p>
<p>In fact, the BNP is becoming the mainstream simply by expanding constantly.  Man,what an organization and what great leaders.</p>
<p>Check out the BNP website and spend some time there and watch how they handle each new challenge that is thrown at them. Bravo BNP! They know the way.</p>
<p>We need the equivalent of the BNP in the U.S.</p>

<p>that clown still doesnt get it. its not the government&rsquo;s job to &#8220;deliver on affordable housing and jobs&#8221;&hellip; not to britons and certainly not to foreign invaders. but it is the utter contempt that Labor has shown to britons in stealing their tax dollars to support invasion that has done them the most damage. and now he wants to buy britons off with housing and jobs??? no, sir. theyve already shown their stripes. its too late for bribes now. dont throw away the chance to oust those arrogant traitors. and dont forget to vote BNP.</p>

			<p>The powers that be in Britain are probably marginally intelligent enough to understand that this &#8220;threat&#8221; is really working to the advantage of all native-born Britons.  How stupid can the &#8220;leadership&#8221; get?  It&rsquo;s time that these limp-wristed imbeciles were removed and replaced with those who have an eye toward a future acceptable to those who prefer more of the old-world order that once made Britain great.  I hope to see a rejuvenation of Britain&rsquo;s vigor under some decent leadership.</p>

<p>To be honest I can imagine a similar party emerging in the US, as America and Britain have similar political systems (ie. unfair ones that discourage the growth of new parties) and similar problems (though America&rsquo;s are much more pronounced). Surely there must be fertile ground for such a party in the US electorate, with many working-class whites feeling alienated from the Democrats, and socially conservative Republicans weary of the agenda set by the Neo-Cons who dominate their party.</p>

			<p>A review of other stories on this AMREN page alone proves the point regarding a huge increase in support for the BNP. Local newspapers in various parts of UK have reported a noticable rise in black crime where White police officers have been held back to make room for black recruits. Same thing in the islamic areas of Yorkshire where muslim PCO&rsquo;s have been recruited to placate muslims but are used to ensure Englishmen are denied access to pakistani areas of many towns. The story about the terrorist horde of &#8216;asian invaders&rsquo; attacking a lone English boy but who are not accused of a racist crime which would have guaranteed a much longer jail sentence is typical of the pro-muslim labour scottish dominated &#8216;government&rsquo; we are saddled with. The BNP is fully legal, so are their candidates, and this must really ranckle the compacent labourites whenever yet another BNP parliamentary seat is won by virtue of the real will of the people casting their votes for the only true British party.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Peter Hain and his rent-a-mob thugs will be given their usual free reign by the politically correct police to intimidate white voters.</p>

			<p>&#8221;Last night, the former minister Peter Hain said: &ldquo;Everybody across the political spectrum &mdash; especially the Labour Party &mdash; has to prioritise beating the BNP with a vigorous strategy based on grassroots politics to win local trust and also making sure we deliver on affordable housing and deliver on jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is code for let&rsquo;s demonise the BNP. This perma-tanned clown and his Zanu Labour cronies know the game is up. And there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing the neo-Marxist political elite can do about it. The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag due to Internet sites like the BNP site showing people that the Lib/Lab/Con political elite and their neo-Marxist lackeys in the MSM have been lying to the British people for decades about the &#8216;knuckle-draggers&rsquo; of the BNP. They know mass immigration is never going to stop under the pro-EU neo-Marxists and that our powerless government can&rsquo;t even prevent foreign companies giving  British jobs to workers from other EU countries because of EU laws. And ordinary workers are now are also behind the &#8221;British jobs for British Workers&#8221; walkouts and are bypassing the Trade Union bosses who like the New Labour government are wedded to the pro-Marxist EU. It&rsquo;s a joy to watch every day now the demonising that worked for decades now completely backfire as THE BRAINWASHING NO LONGER WORKS and people are now aware that these &#8216;nasty racists&rsquo; are in fact ordinary Britons like themselves who are sick and tired of watching neo-Marxist politicians destroy their country by mass immigration and have sold out its sovereignty to the EUSSR. With the Euro elections due in June it would be well worth watching the British political scene on the Internet and MSM to see day-by-day how the multicultural society is collapsing because everybody now knows it&rsquo;s a House of Cards built on neo-Marxist lies and deceit that is crumbling and ready to fall.</p>

			<p>We constantly hear a lot about &#8220;extreme rightwing and extreme leftwing&#8221; elements.  But the most extreme element is the government and politicians in the center.  Destroying the country&hellip;</p>
<p>We need a term for them&hellip;Midwing?  Deathwing?  Any suggestions?</p>

			<p><i>Last night, the former minister Peter Hain warned that every political party was guilty of &ldquo;complacency&rdquo; over the threat posed by the BNP. He said: &ldquo;Everybody across the political spectrum &mdash; especially the Labour Party &mdash; has to prioritise beating the BNP with a vigorous strategy based on grassroots politics to win local trust and also making sure we deliver on affordable housing and deliver on jobs.</i></p>
<p>In other words, &#8220;bread and circuses.&#8221; Buy off those idiot voters with their own money, paid for by selling out their own country. But everything&rsquo;s coming to a head now and Great Britain is not going to be able to finance its welfare state with massive debt anymore. They&rsquo;re going to have to pay as they go, and that&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>The BNP is growing in strength because every other party has banned honest discussion of real immigration enforcement and real immigration reduction. Take France: Sarkozy ran as an immigration enforcer and now he&rsquo;s as open borders as anyone.</p>
<p>The BNP is the only party that can be trusted to actually push real immigration reform.</p>
<p>I wish we had a viable BNP-style party here in the US. One day it may get so bad that we will.</p>

			<p>We need to address this issue from every possible angle. One neglected point of view is the devastating effect a half a century of relentless propaganda has had on Whites, men mostly. There is just no denying the psychological and emotional impact, made worse by the general intellectual decline which makes us more vulnerable, less able to defend ourselves or even believe in ourselves. That would explain the great wave relief that rolled over many of us when, while drifting through cyberspace, we came across sites like VDARE and AR, and certainly others (as well as a lot of interesting blogs).</p>
<p>But, in the spirit of &#8220;every little bit helps&#8221; I think a wonderful, but shamefully neglected, resource in this regard is the great work done in the field of Family Systems Psychology. In my view it has an awful lot of intellectual respectability and it is highly relevant. But don&rsquo;t take my word for it. See for yourself.<br>

			<p>To the casual observer, The BNP carries power, influence and major weight. <br>
They are strong men and women who have common sense, think and speak clearly. Clear as a bell. </p>
<p>These journalists that attack the BNP sound hateful, spiteful, weak and defeated. Every single lame journalist who does this loses their credibility and I am surprised they can even stay employed because readers pretty much write them off at that point. </p>
