<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/26/illegals-targeted-sheriff-as-part-of-gang-initiati/">Illegals Targeted Sheriff As Gang Initiation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lexington County, S.C., Deputy Sheriff Ted Xanthakis and his K-9 police dog, Arcos, were attacked by the three illegals armed with a 12-gauge shotgun during a Feb. 8 incident in West Columbia, S.C., shortly after 3 a.m. The deputy and his dog survived.</p>
<p>Two of the men were identified in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report as members of the Surenos gang, or SUR-13, a collection of Mexican-American street gangs with origins in the oldest barrios of Southern California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 15-year-old and two others, Carlos Alfredo Diaz De Leon, 17, and Lucino Guzman Guttierrez, 20, were later arrested by sheriff&rsquo;s deputies and members of the U.S. Marshals Service. Diaz De Leon and Guzman Guttierrez were charged with assault and battery with intent to kill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 15-year-old was taken to a pre-trial detention facility, where he was awaiting a hearing in family court. Prosecutors said they would recommend that the boy be prosecuted in family court on a charge of assault and battery with intent to kill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ICE report, made public Wednesday by the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC (ALIPAC), said interviews determined that the 15-year-old was the shooter and the incident was a gang initiation. It said gangs &#8220;have long posed a threat to public safety and law enforcement but the threat is now increasing in scope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Never before have the street gangs in South Carolina actively targeted law enforcement officers for gang initiation.&#8221;</p>
<p>ICE agents, as part of a nationwide crackdown on gangs, have arrested members of SUR-13 in Tennessee and Georgia on charges ranging from felony theft and illegal re-entry after deportation to murder, attempted murder, carjacking, armed robbery and drug dealing.</p>
<p>William Gheen, president of ALIPAC, described the attack as the &#8220;beginning of America&rsquo;s nightmarish future as we descend into the type of anarchy found in Mexico.</p>

			<p>Why did they have the 15-year old do the shooting?  Because he was the youngest, so they thought he would get off the easier than the others.  And if they would have killed the Deputy Sheriff, he would not have been eligible for the death penalty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it is with these gang and thug types, now that SCOTUS says no executing anyone under 18.  They farm their dirty work to those under 18.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He said the U.S. needs to secure its border and enforce its immigration laws &#8220;or we will begin to lose more officers and as we loose officers, gang rule will replace the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>That certainly could be in store for us, but Mexico will crack first before we get quite that far. </p>
<p>Mexico will certainly erupt into more violence, and there&rsquo;s a 80-20 chance they&rsquo;re going to be overtaken by the drug cartels.  Pablo Escobar&rsquo;s cartel very nearly took control of Columbia, and would have done so if he hadn&rsquo;t moved too fast and had waited until he had a larger army and more legislators on the payroll before making his move to enter politics as a high profile figure.  There were other cartels in Columbia but, compared to Escobar, they were small-timers.</p>
<p>Mexico has much more prosperous, more powerful cartels than Columbia had during Escobar&rsquo;s reign, and the income from illegal drugs are reportedly far greater, and they have many more soldiers on the ground, who are armed as fully as standing armies from many countries. Too, unlike Escobar&rsquo;s minions, they have gained a foothold of sorts in Washington, D.C. and have growing numbers and influence in the Southwest US, and we can be certain that the gangs and MANY illegals interspersed throughout the country will be soldiers in waiting for them to be used as needed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been claimed by experts that a Mexican takeover by gangs would mandate a military response by the US.  But what would happen to areas in the US where gangs and illegals are entrenched? And how about the Reconquistas who are numerous and very strong in the Southwest?</p>
<p>The gangs we know for certain will be with the cartels, and against the US and could act as insurgency forces throughout the country.  But I believe the real danger is upwards of thirty million illegals who are likewise interspersed geographically, and it can be said with certainty they wouldn&rsquo;t take kindly hearing about their friends and family in Mexico being listed as collateral damage after a US strike or the result of US ground action and/or watching it occur on television.  And in this scenario we&rsquo;re talking about upwards of 30 million people.  Plus many legal immigrants more than likely would be a threat also.</p>
<p>Often I&rsquo;ve responded to calls by those who want to initiate some kind of action against radical elements of this nation by pointing out that we don&rsquo;t really have to do anything but watch, wait and be prepared, because this multicultural madhouse will implode all on its own.  I hate to say I was right-on.    </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect it to come this quickly, but without doubt the diversity factor brought down our country, and created a devastating domino effect around the world, and now the greatest physical threat to our nation is this same multicultural insanity.</p>
<p>What gang of miscreants need dictatorial control when it is so easy to condition people to accept slogans and policies that quite clearly are lies and obviously will destroy an entire country and culture?</p>

			<p>I have worked in law enforcement for 24 years, and the younger males, 14-20 are clearly the most dangerous. They have a mindset that they are invincible and bulletproof. Thats exactly why the gang leaders initiate them this way. </p>
<p> I train new officers that just because the bad guy looks like a kid is no reason to lower your willingness to use lethal force. </p>
<p>  The fact that these punks grow and thrive in the US is directly due to the politicians who turn the other way and let them across our borders. </p>

			<p>Idiots rule America. And their stupidity is self-inflicted. They hold on to such nonse as &#8220;all people are interchangeable&#8221; and &#8220;all cultures are equal&#8221;, frantically attacking everyone and everything that testifies to the contrary.</p>
<p>These idiots assert that suggesting that certain genetic groups are less likely to succeed and more likely to exhibit asocial behavior (criminal or rebellious) is a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the idiots seem to multiply at a faster rate than the rest of us, which gives them definite electoral advantage. This is why it is so difficult to vote an idiot out of his elected office - multitudes of other idiots are casting their votes for him.<br/>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly.  If we don&rsquo;t lost the country via bankruptcy, we will trash it as a narco-republic in a civil battle to drive out the gangs, and it will probably evolve into a racial fight with blacks involved.</p>
<p>The ONLY answer to the problem is to legalize drugs and have some kind of government oversight. </p>
<p>Personally, I believe if a person wants to slowly kill himself with drugs it&rsquo;s his choice, because it&rsquo;s his body, so long as he doesn&rsquo;t get high and drive, work, and/or otherwise be a danger to someone else.</p>
<p>The jail population would be reduced to a manageable level, and there wouldn&rsquo;t be any recidivism, because legalization would take the profit out of selling.</p>
<p>And so far as kids having easier access to it.  I don&rsquo;t think so.  No more than alcohol is right now.</p>

			<p>Flaxen Haired Strumpet is right- taking the profit motive out of the drug trade would virtually eliminate the struggle for power between rival gangs. Mexico would have to find another industry to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<p>After all, what is more dangerous- having feral gang bangers warring it out as they currently are or having stoners in our midst (which I hate to break it to everyone, BUT WE ALREADY DO!)The way I see it, this country is living on life support as it is.  When law enforcement is out gunned by drug lords and their minions, something drastic needs to be done.  Before you guys flame me, just consider the money and resources we have already wasted, not to mention the lives of law enforcement officers lost in an effort to win the unwinnable &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;.</p>
<p>If people want to consume drugs till their hearts explode, let them.  Adios I say.  </p>

			<p>To Flaxen-headed Strumpet;</p>
<p>I agree with you. In fact, I am in favor of setting up state and local level drug supply centers where the addicts can:</p>
<p>1. Register as a drug addict, and sign some legal paperwork.<br/>
2. If the addict wants to, get counseling and help to kick the habit<br/>
3. If they don&rsquo;t want to kick it, they must stay on the premises and will be allowed to intake a monster dose of the most powerful drugs available. The center will have sufficient security, TVs and video games to ensure the addicts stay local and are entertained while using.</p>
<p>Step #3 may prove to be fatal for many</p>
<p>Compared to the wasted BILLIONS the idiots have poured in the phony war on drugs, these centers are cheap.</p>
<p>This approach will put the Mexican and South American drug cartels out-of-business. </p>
<p>Also, the legal, drug manufacturers would have to be based in the United States and guaranteed to hire only legal Americans. This is a better economic growth opportunity than anything put forth in the Spendulus.</p>
<p>Here are some other economic benefits:<br/>
1. Police and fire costs would be reduced as they would only need to respond to the drug addict centers instead of zooming all over the city responding to both the drug gang violence and overdoses.<br/>
2. The number of burglaries by addicts would plummet reducing police costs and insurance company outlays.<br/>
3. The black and mexican gangs would lose their primary source of income forcing them to diversify (harder to make money) or go elsewhere to find new markets. Gangs without money are not really gangs anymore saving lots of law enforcement costs.<br/>
4. The Federal law enforcements costs would be dramatically reduced. I am sure the DEA staff/budget could be cut a minimum with the FBI following suit.</p>
<p>I think its worth trying. </p>

			<p>There are few bootleggers in America today, but during Prohibition they were everywhere, so many people (stupid fools) seem to want these drugs and are willing to get them at ANY price. It seems to me that IF they were made legal under controlled circumstances these DRUG DEALERS would be out of business overnight? As disgusting as this sounds even to me I wonder if this isn&rsquo;t going to be the only way to control what is going on? </p>

			<p>&#8220;A Reader&#8221;, I think you&rsquo;re wrong. I think the people allowing this to happen know exactly what is going on and what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re not idiots. They don&rsquo;t believe one word of the equality nonsense they preach to the public. That&rsquo;s just cover. They want the (public) to be destroyed by brain dead people like the three who attacked the Sheriff.</p>

			<p>Flax is completely correct.  When I was in federal prison, marijuana was readily available.  Since prison is by any definition a controlled environment, illegal drugs should be unavailable there.  Since they were not, I believe the drug war is a waste of time and money.  </p>
<p>Before my arrest in 2000, I never thought I would think this way, but I also never thought I would be going to prison, either.</p>

			<p>Mexican gangs in South Carolina. Hmm. Don&rsquo;t ask Senator Lindsay Grahma, if you live in South Carolina, whether he intends to do anything about this. He might accuse you of being a bigot or a hater, the way he did to Americans in general, when they protested vigorously against amnesty and illegal immigration in South Carolina. I don&rsquo;t know how Americans throughout the nation put up with guys like Graham, who skate along in their offices, supposedly representing the citizenry, while foreign illegal alien national gangs commit mayhem on the communities these elected officials supposedly represent. In Grahams case, he was re-elected just a short while ago. Americans are their own worst enemies.</p>

			<p>Yes, I agree with Flaxen; it will take the fangs out of the drug cartels, but it won&rsquo;t curb violence.  There will be more burglaries, robberies and home invasions.  If the blacks and hispanics and white trash can&rsquo;t sell drugs to get their money, they will find another way.  They aren&rsquo;t suddenly going to be educated, with a good work ethic.  These are the people that an employer would be crazy to hire because they&rsquo;d drive his business into the ground.  As my 81 year old dear friend who used to work at Sikorsky Aircraft says, &#8220;some people think they deserve a paycheck for just showing up!&#8221;</p>

			<p>All of us here, already know, the only viable solution to this gang-related nonsense, even if AmRen will not allow any such posts on this site. The gang-bangers are not going to get religion in a revival tent. They are not going to find the winning lottery ticket and move to Beverly Hills to live like a movie star. There are not enough prisons to hold the ones who richly deserve to be in prison. The gang-banger species has no natural enemies or predators, other than each other. The gang-bangers are prolific and multiply more quickly than any other species because there is no lifecylce&hellip;..being a gang-banger is an infectuous disease and not a being. (A child may be an innocent being for a decade or more and suddenly become a gang-banger.) Gangs are a communicable disease, not an age, or a race, or a language.</p>

			<p>Could the reason the government wants to keep drugs illegal be that too much money is to be made from the drug trade. Including money funneled into politicians coffers, either as campaign contributions or &#8220;gifts?&#8221; Look to Mexico&hellip; probably more than half the politicians, police and military are on the drug cartels&rsquo; payrolls.</p>

			<p>Another comment on the apathetic, non-chalant, almost willfully blind attitude of most American citizens  &mdash;   they even allow their law officers to suffer attacks and targeting by illegal alien gangs. What can one say? You would think, that just for their own best interests, these citizens would be targeting their city councils and judges and whatever it would take, to be rid of these poisonous illegal alien gangs. My God, it is enervating to read about these stories. It literally drains ones spirit, to read about and watch Americans non-reactions to the mayhem surrounding them.</p>

<p>Posted by Flaxen-headed Strumpet at 10:03 PM on February 27</p>
<p>I would posit that 10 or 20 years ago your commentary would have stirred up a hornet&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>Now, the proposition to legalize drugs is becoming more and more acceptable as many are at last realizing that the drug war is indeed unwinnable.</p>
<p>I heard Harry Browne speak clearly, rationally and brilliantly about the futility and insanity of continuing the drug war way back in 1995. He called for legalizing drugs, all of them, and the sooner the better.</p>
<p>At that time he was called every name for crazy  &mdash;  as in &#8216;looney-tarian&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Harry was anything but. </p>
<p>And he was right.</p>
<p>Here are a few of his wise, prescient words about the Drug Wars:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The&hellip;consequence of outlawing private behavior is that the prohibited activity spawns a black market run by criminals. </p>
<p>Drugs are sold only by people willing to risk being caught and sent to prison. The business becomes the province of gangsters&hellip;drug dealers compete by gang warfare. </p>
<p>And the more the government cracks down on drug operations, the more drug activity is dominated by the most brutal elements of society.</p>
<p>The most important step we must take is to end the federal government&rsquo;s involvement with drugs.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t America learn this lesson from alcohol Prohibition&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.harrybrowne.org/GLO/DrugWar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.harrybrowne.org/GLO/DrugWar.htm</a></p>
<p>Apparently not, although some would say the Drug War is one more excuse to expand the power of the state over YOUR life and the government has no intention of putting an end to it.</p>
<p>Flax:  I noticed that not one poster defended continuing the War on Drugs or considered your comments inflammatory, indeed all of the comments on your original post called for ending the government&rsquo;s stupid, pointless, costly war.</p>
<p>Rest in Peace,  Harry.  It turns out you were a beacon of sanity in an insane world (as you often referred to yourself).  Are you listening Sean Hannity?</p>
