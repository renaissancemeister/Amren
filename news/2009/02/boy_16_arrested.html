			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlotte Gill and Matt Sandy, Daily Mail (London), February 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the murder of a teenager who was one of two knifed to death in London, police said today.</p>
<p>Michael Wright was found with fatal stab wounds outside a train station in an apparent gang killing on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police said a 16-year-old suspect was in custody at an east London police station.</p>
<p>The forced added that a woman in her 30s had also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and was in custody.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old was one of two teenagers who were stabbed to death within hours of each other in a night of bloodshed on London&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p>Michael was attacked in Leytonstone Road, opposite Maryland rail station in east London, at about 10.30pm. He died at the Royal London Hospital shortly after being found.</p>
<p>His friends, many hiding their faces with scarves or hoods, gathered at the scene yesterday to lay flowers and pay their respects as a large number of police looked on.</p>
<p>Bleir Xhana, 26, who runs a bar yards from where the incident happened, said: &#8216;A customer walked in and said they saw a black guy just lying there on the zebra crossing near the station.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t know what had happened to the boy but I was horrified and afraid.</p>
<p>&#8216;To be honest it is quite dangerous round here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dead man&rsquo;s brother also visited the scene yesterday to lay flowers.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I have no idea why it happened or why he was stabbed  &mdash;  no one was after him.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was a very popular nice lad and we were tight. I&rsquo;m proud of my brother and I am just gutted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The attack on Michael Wright came just three hours after 19-year-old Kul Hawalied was stabbed to death in a separate incident in Wealdstone, north-west London.</p>
<p>The university student was knifed in the chest by a group of thugs in a suspected gang war between Somlais and Afghanis.</p>
<p>Mr Hawalied, from north-west London, was treated by paramedics but was pronounced dead at the scene. Another teenager was also injured.</p>
<p>The earlier killing happened at 7.30pm as Mr Hawadleh and an 18-year-old friend stopped at a service station in Wealdstone, north west London.</p>
<p>As the pair, who are both Somali, got out of their car, four or five youths on the other side of the road saw them and came over to confront them.</p>
<p>They knifed Mr Hawadleh and his companion before fleeing on foot.</p>
<p>Mr Hawadleh died at the scene while his friend is in a stable condition in hospital.</p>
<p>A friend of the two men, Abdul Hassan, 22, said that the pair were attacked in a race gang war by Afghanis.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I&rsquo;m sure the guys who killed Hassan didn&rsquo;t know him, they are just targeting any Somalis.</p>
<p>&#8216;There was a stabbing on Wednesday, and then yesterday afternoon two of my other friends got ran up to by a gang of guys in bandanas.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are all Afghan or black and they are targeting Somalis.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hassan was not involved in anything like this, there is no reason he would be targeted. Everyone loved the guy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hawadleh moved to the UK with his family when he was one year old and was studying media at the University of East London.</p>
<p>He was one of eight siblings. His sister Ubed said: &#8216;We don&rsquo;t know why he got stabbed, I don&rsquo;t know why anyone would want to hurt him.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have a real problem in society today  &mdash;  stabbing has just become the norm  &mdash;  it has replaced fist fighting. People&rsquo;s lives are no longer valued.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hassan was not the sort of person to get involved in any fighting. He wasn&rsquo;t the sort of boy to hang out in gangs, he was a sensible character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His brother, Yonis, 29, said: &#8216;He had a real zest for life. He really wanted to go into the media business and travel around the world.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was never in trouble with the police. He just wasn&rsquo;t like that. He was with his mates from uni going to play football.</p>
<p>&#8216;He didn&rsquo;t know the people who attacked him. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We&rsquo;re not sure if his friends knew them, we don&rsquo;t know anything more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another friend, 23-year-old Issaq Soul, said: &#8216;There is a war going on between the Afghans and the Somalis.</p>
<p>&#8216;The tension has been building. They want to call the shots around here. They are completely lawless. But Kul wasn&rsquo;t caught up in all that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There have been no arrests in either case.</p>
<p>The two deaths bring the total of teen killings in London to three this year. Last year, 28 teenagers were killed in the capital.</p>
<p>Police are appealing for witnesses to Mr Hawalied&rsquo;s killing.</p>
<p>Anyone with information should call the incident room on 020 7321 9251 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.<br>

			<p>I like the Daily Mail, but I again cringe at the use of &#8220;knife crime&#8221; and &#8220;knife victim.&#8221;  It doesn&rsquo;t seem that the knife did these things all by itself.  What is it about blacks and Somalians that make knives behave so badly?</p>
<p>Have a look at the original article, especially the pics.  All black, save a whitish-looking guy with a Red Sox hat, and a white guy mostly obscured by a black guy.</p>

<p>Do the lefties in the media really need to heed only the forecast of a race war seriously if it comes from a kid who isn&rsquo;t even old enough to understand anything beyond stealing and mugging?</p>
<p>I mean, reputable social analysts have been sayin for years it just isn&rsquo;t possible to put different people together without creating intergroup conflicts that could well reach the level of civil war, so homogeneity should be the norm without exception.  </p>
<p>Speaking in accepted terms so it won&rsquo;t frighten the radical leftists, these forecasts are euphemistically referring to &#8220;Balkanization.&#8221;  They&rsquo;ve been warning against this for years from many people who have tried to convince the muliticults that their &#8220;diversity&#8221; plans are insane and will create disorder and could topple every country that attempts such experimentation.</p>
<p>Well, if I could be so bold as to remind the writer of this story, who thinks forecasting civil war is only valid if it comes from a teenage non-white, that we&rsquo;re in the beginning of the what will likely be great civil upheavals, because the nation states globally are set to be &#8220;redefined,&#8221; as Rupert Murdoch has mentioned just yesterday.</p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;redefined&#8221; is another euphemism that is uttered so as not to upset the effeminate politicians and MSM limp wristers, but in common terms he&rsquo;s telling us that the nation state could very well be taken over by the people and remade into something besides this multicultural mess we have now, run by large corrupt governments that have proven more interested in social engineering than serving their people in matters that are in their best interests.</p>
<p>Hoping to prevent that, these same corrupt politicians will have to disarm us.</p>
<p>As the new American attorney general clumsily tried to psyche us into believing that our most important moment now is to bow down and serve blacks and quit being cowards by resisting it, he will likewise be working dilligently from this point forward to incrementally take our right to defend ouselves with guns away from us.  This entire administration is corrupt and so are most of the members of this present Congress.</p>
<p>The only way we have of fighting for our second amendment rights are citizen groups, and people as brave as the woman on the following video speaking up and letting it be known that the second amendment is not about hunting.  It&rsquo;s for protection against corrupt politicians.</p>
<p>Watch this video all the way through.  It&rsquo;s very powerful, especially towards the end.</p>

			<p>Afghanis are very Meditteranian-looking Caucasians. Somalis are some of the blackest of Africans. Apparently, the fact that both are Muslim means very little and it all comes down to race. </p>

			<p>England has deteriorated almost beyond recognition.  And what is sad is British citizens are not even allowed to openly comment on or acknowledge British society deterioration or the PC gestapo will harass them.   </p>

			<p>I went to a high school with a pretty large North Asian population (it was a magnet school for science, go figure).  I remember an incident on the bus after school which was quite atypical because our students almost never quarreled.  A Chinese boy berated a Taiwanese girl to tears, solely on the basis of her being an &#8220;islander&#8221;.  There was no provocation.  Here we have two people of the same race, and practically the same nationality, and yet they still can&rsquo;t get along because of perceived differences.</p>
<p>Diversity advocates, your move.</p>

			<p>The penny, belatedly, has finally dropped.<br>
Joy, the Epiphany has come.<br>
No, forget the &#8220;Britain is a rich, vibrant, diverse and multicultural society&#8221; dogma that we have had to stomach for the last decade and substitute, &#8220;Britain is a poor, violent, dangerous and multicoloured society&#8221;.<br>
Sorry lads, we, your elected leaders, made a mistake within the model of Altruistic Globalism.<br>
Thank you NuLabour&hellip;. for nothing.</p>

			<p>During World War 2, my Dad was a member of an unexploded bomb disposal squad in the Leytonstone/Maryland area.  He saw several of his comrades blown to bits before his eyes.  Is this what they died for?  So that worthless 3rd world riff-raff can wage their sordid gang wars there.  Sadly, it would seem so.</p>

			<p>Reply to Joe English:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s exactly what they died for, although the British government (really the Labour party) didn&rsquo;t TELL them that. Britain never should have fought Germany. I trace all Britain&rsquo;s problems and decline from 1914 onward. Britain NEVER should have abandoned the &#8220;splendid isolation&#8221; strategy in 1906. Just eight years later this got the U.K. into the worst war it had ever known. Such stupidity.</p>

			<p>Here in Canada, Afghans fight Lebanese, and Somalis fight everyone.  The fights are usually over drug selling, which seems to be a common occupation among worshipers of Mohamed. </p>
