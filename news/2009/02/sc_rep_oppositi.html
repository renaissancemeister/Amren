<h1>SC Rep: Opposition to Stimulus Is Slap in Face</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Page Ivey, AP, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The highest-ranking black congressman said Thursday that opposition to the federal stimulus package by southern GOP governors is &#8220;a slap in the face of African-Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said he was insulted when the governors of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and his home state, which have large black populations, said they might not accept some of the money from the $787 billion stimulus package.</p>
<p>Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday he would accept the money, and none of the others has rejected it outright. The Republican governors of Idaho and Alaska also said they had reservations about whether the money would come with too many strings attached, but Clyburn said he was particularly taken aback by southern governors who said they might decline it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clyburn spokeswoman Hope Derrick later said Clyburn didn&rsquo;t mean he thought those governors were racially motivated in their opposition, but that rejecting stimulus money would hurt black residents.</p>
<p>Clyburn began his remarks to reporters Thursday by talking about the Juneteenth celebration, which marks when slaves in Texas finally learned they had been freed by the Emancipation Proclamation more than a year after it happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing my history and knowing Texas history, all of this, it was a slap in the face of African-Americans,&#8221; Clyburn said.</p>

			<p>Look at this from the other side of the coin:  Clyburn is admitting that the only way blacks will have anything is if government spends money.</p>

			<p>Another piece of proof that the vast majority of blacks can&rsquo;t say NO to anything perceived to be free.  Scratch &#8220;perceive&#8221; from my prior statement.  For blacks, it will be yet another freebie, not perceived but actual, forcefully extracted from the labor and sacrifices of the vast majority of whites.<br>

<p>Apparently this  highest-ranking black congressman thinks the stimulus package is exclusively for black Americans..what else can  you glean from his statemen?  Guys like this are always more than willing to call people racists when they are actually the racists.  This pretty much runs through the black community.</p>
<p>Clyburn need not worry, BHO will look out for the &#8220;brothers.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is just another indication of how racial integration threatens our democratic liberties.  </p>
<p>Blacks are always in bed with the federal government; the same government that provides them with special consideration at our expense.</p>
<p>How were our interests promoted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964?  That was the end of freedom of association for us.</p>
<p>And our freedom of expression is gradually eroding too; how candid a &#8220;Conversation on Race&#8221; will the Department of Justice and its &#8220;protected classes&#8221; actually tolerate?  </p>
<p>See the recent AmRen articles and comments about new DOJ head, Eric Holder (1/19 &amp; 1/20).  We &#8220;cowards&#8221; had best hold our tongues; &#8220;hate speech&#8221; by whites is gauged quite differently than that of blax.  </p>

<p>Why not? Everything else is a slap in the face to blacks. Why not this?</p>

			<p>   And for the stimulus money, the states will have to surrender all claims of states rights. In essence, welcome to the Socialist Republic of Amerika.</p>

			<p>Blacks always claim that they are not any more dependent upon government spending than anyone else. Yet when those programs are challenged, it&rsquo;s &#8220;racism&#8221; at work. Which is it? You can&rsquo;t claim opposition to the &#8220;stimulus&#8221; bill (Mr. Orwell, call your office) is not in large degree aimed to benefit blacks <i>and</i> that criticizing the bill is &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

			<p>  Is there anything that doesn&rsquo;t offend minorities? If the hispanics aren&rsquo;t offended, it&rsquo;s the blacks, or the muslims, or gays, or whomever. I&rsquo;m offended by them for being offended. </p>

			<p>We are only one month into Obama&rsquo;s term in office, and already opponents of his POLICIES are attacked as racists. It might be best to keep in mind that great line by Bette Davis in All About Eve: &#8220;Fasten your seatbelts; it&rsquo;s gonna be a bumpy ride.&#8221; </p>

			<p>With their victimization mentality and culture, EVERYTHING is a &#8216;slap in the face&rsquo; to blacks. If it moves its a slap in the face. If it doesn&rsquo;t move its a slap in the face.</p>

			<p>Just as 9/11 was used by the Rebublicans and Bush to further their agenda, the current financial crisis is being used by the Democrats and Obama to further their agenda. This is Mr. Obama&rsquo;s plan to &#8216;distribute the wealth&rsquo;. Obama was talking about this even before the financial crisis. Many blacks are unable to produce even what they need to survive while most whites are able to produce more than what they need to survive. From each according to their ability.</p>
<p>For the many blacks who cannot achieve what is necessary to survive the choices are to just let them die off per Darwin or to help them per Marx. The problem is always trying to determine who cannot achieve from those who will not achieve.</p>

			<p>Not entirely related, but this is a good example of how politically retarded Americans are.  Yesterday I followed a link on Drudge to a wymmin&rsquo;s political site where a commenter was criticizing Republicans for voting against the stimulus, and then asking for their share of the stimulus money.  None of her fellow wymmin called her on her daft &#8220;logic&#8221; either.  It&rsquo;d be like I opposed being robbed by a highwayman, and was then called a hypocrite for wanting some of my money back afterwards.  I suppose in her mind, Republicans should have voted against it, lost the vote, been robbed by the Democrat&rsquo;s vote of his and his constituents&rsquo; tax dollars, then &#8220;un-hypocritically&#8221; refused to have any of the ill-gotten gain go back into his constituents&rsquo; pockets, thus doubly rewarding Democrats and setting an enormously stupid precedent (&#8220;slap me in the face and I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar&#8221;).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope we never need to convince this person of anything.</p>

			<p>The only reason Clyburn continues to get elected is because of how the congressional district lines have been drawn and the resulting overabundance of black constituents.  He is a racist politician who knows his gravy train will continue to run only as long as he keeps his peeps in new threads, $250 sneakers, new Escalades, and of course, bling bling.</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of the mind numbing, never ending pity party being thrown by blacks who are too lazy to make an honest day&rsquo;s living.</p>

<p>I would keep those black gerrymandered districts and tolerate the Clyburns of the world for this reason:  Because if you box black voters off in their own districts, it means that white liberals have no reliable votes to beat white conservatives in the white districts.  This is why the GOP was able to take over the House in 1994, ironically, neo/lamer whining about it and their dismantling is why they lost the House in 2006 partially.</p>

			<p>Clyburn actually has a point; Obama said in the past that he believes in giving blacks &#8220;secret&#8221; reparations.  He said at an NAACP meeting in, I believe, 2001 that giving official reparations would cause white resentment and make whites feel like they longer owe blacks anything.  His plan was to use housing and medical services as a way to give blacks reparations under the radar.  This stimulus bill is the fruition of his plans.<br>
White, middle class America will not see a dime of this money although we will certainly be paying for it, either through higher taxes or inflation.  God bless Governor Sanford for standing up for taxpayers against this spending orgy.  He&rsquo;s got my vote in 2012 should he choose to run.</p>

			<p>That &#8220;victimhood culture&#8221; of Blacks&hellip; is it acquired or a birth defect? Seems like virtually anything and everything elecits Blacks to perceive it an insult or slight. Wonder just how many more millenia it will take for Blacks to catch up to the rest of humanity.</p>
