			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Song, Los Angeles Times, February 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Karina De La Cruz wakes up in the dark on her first day of classes at UCLA.</p>
<p>Pushing herself off a two-seat couch in the living room of a San Pedro apartment this September morning, she tries not to wake a brother sleeping in a twin bed next to her, or another dozing with his wife and baby daughter in the bedroom. De La Cruz dresses quickly and briefly considers taking her skateboard, then thinks of how her mother rolls her eyes whenever she rides it. She leaves it behind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She hurries to the corner to catch the bus, clutching her last $5. She scans the road  &mdash;  she can&rsquo;t be late, can&rsquo;t do anything that would hurt her chances of maintaining a B average. The first in her family to attend college, De La Cruz believes that a 3.0 is her way out of a crowded apartment and into a life with new opportunities.</p>
<p>De La Cruz faces fairy tale odds. She&rsquo;s an illegal immigrant, so she isn&rsquo;t eligible for most forms of state and federal financial aid. The University of California system, by policy, does not require applicants to disclose their citizenship status: Officials say their goal is to find the best students, not to enforce immigration law. UCLA officials say they aren&rsquo;t even sure how many undocumented students are on their campus.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old De La Cruz graduated barely in the top 20% of her San Pedro High class and is competing against students with much higher GPAs and test scores. She probably doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to finish her first year of classes.</p>
<p>She has almost no safety net: She doesn&rsquo;t know her father, and her mother, who lives across the street, didn&rsquo;t get up to wish her good luck. She met a few people during orientation but doesn&rsquo;t have anyone she would consider a friend.</p>
<p>UCLA officials acknowledge that some freshmen are admitted for reasons other than their grades and test scores, that some students come from dramatically different backgrounds than many of their peers but show academic promise. They say there are programs on campus to help these students But De La Cruz isn&rsquo;t aware of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>De La Cruz was born in Mexico. One of her first memories is running through the darkness to a van when she was 4 years old as her brother whispered to her to be quiet. They drove to San Pedro, where her mother had family. Her mother found work in a fish cannery, working seven days a week while the children went to school.</p>
<p>De La Cruz struggled in elementary school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never make sense of the language and only understood half the things people said,&#8221; she wrote in her UCLA application essay. Things weren&rsquo;t better at home. The family lived in a small apartment with an aunt, and De La Cruz&rsquo;s mother seemed preoccupied with saving enough money to move out. She had little time to spend with her children, much less attend parent-teacher conferences. The two grew distant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The average UCLA freshman boasted a 4.22 GPA in 10th and 11th grades, according to the most recent data posted by the school, and De La Cruz had a 3.365 at San Pedro High when she applied. She got a 21 out of a possible 36 on the ACT college admissions exam, ranking her in the 48th percentile in California. She scored 380 out of a possible 800 on an SAT subject test, putting her in the third percentile nationwide.</p>
<p>But on March 8, De La Cruz opened an e-mail from UCLA, and a congratulatory banner popped up. She screamed and asked a friend to look.</p>
<p>By her standards, UCLA would be expensive. It costs about $17,500 per year for fees, books, transportation and living expenses. She wanted to live in a dorm, which would add $7,500. She had a job at Wienerschnitzel, but it paid minimum wage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her prayers weren&rsquo;t answered. De La Cruz would have to take at least one remedial English course before she could take regular freshman English, meaning she might have to spend an extra quarter at UCLA. She&rsquo;d hoped to graduate in four years to save money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her mood was still dark a few weeks later, when she went to the Boys &amp; Girls Club&rsquo;s College Bound program annual awards ceremony. But at the end of the evening, she was awarded a $4,000 scholarship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later in the summer, Mike Lansing, director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club in San Pedro, held a fundraiser for De La Cruz, bringing her college fund to $10,680. That was enough for maybe two quarters.</p>
<p>Club officials held out hope that more people would donate, but said they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help more.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Disappointed, she wandered down to Bruin Walk, where sororities were out recruiting. She smoothed her black hair, unruly from two hours on the bus. A blond sorority sister glanced at De La Cruz and yanked back the flier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>De La Cruz missed only one day of classes over the next month. That Friday, she was late to a bus connection and frantically skateboarded down Wilshire Boulevard for 45 minutes before realizing she wouldn&rsquo;t make it in time and turned around, sweaty and frustrated.</p>
<p>Despite her diligence, De La Cruz struggled to keep up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was the second tutoring session De La Cruz attended. UCLA officials say she missed other opportunities: A student like her probably had been invited to a summer program, and there&rsquo;s also an academic advancement program she could have joined, said Thomas Lifka, an associate vice chancellor.</p>
<p>Lifka became exasperated when told De La Cruz hadn&rsquo;t heard of the programs, possibly because she didn&rsquo;t hook up her UCLA e-mail account until well into the school year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before the science midterm, De La Cruz wanted to take an online practice test, but she didn&rsquo;t have access to a computer at home. She returned to San Pedro and worked a few hours, then got back on the bus to Westwood for a study group.</p>
<p>On good days, the promise of a UCLA diploma seemed worth the 80-mile round-trip commute, but that night it seemed overwhelming.</p>
<p>Weeks of riding the bus and struggling through classes had taken its toll. As she rattled north toward campus, De La Cruz realized that her chances of getting a job as a psychologist were tiny even if she were to graduate with a B average because she probably can&rsquo;t afford graduate school and most companies won&rsquo;t hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of the quarter, she had a C-plus in the class. She got an A-minus in art appreciation, earning a B-minus average. Still, she was crushed over her Life Science course.</p>
<p>All of those miles commuting, the cold silences from her mother, the long hours she&rsquo;d worked, only to fall short.</p>

<p>This poor soul has just had the &#8220;cards of life&#8221; stacked against her. Her desperate struggle up-stream under insurmountable odds only to have everything dashed and shattered, well, it just makes one wonder how cruel America&rsquo;s &#8220;white-run&#8221; institutions can be. Damn those &#8220;blond&#8221; sorority sistas!</p>

		<p>She had very mediocre ACTs and SATs, but had a better than 4.0 GPA. Grade and course title inflation, anyone?  Though UCLA does not ask, they had to have figured she was an illegal alien, probably because they knew that she couldn&rsquo;t get certain kinds of college aid.  Why did they admit her?  Racial pandering, of course.</p>

		<p>Even granting Ms. De La Cruz is a gem, a doubtful thought, is her presence enough to offset her dismal family, which certainly seems to be a net drain on our resources. Still, credit the L.A. Times story with making clear she is a borderline UCLA student, which is plainly code for AA recipient. The Times must have heard from its, mostly white, readers.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action for one is negative action against another.  The illegal alien with such a record is admitted while numerous better qualified whites are not.  All in the name of &#8220;equal opportunity.&#8221;!  And the new Black chair of the Republican Party is a firm supporter of affirmative action.  Such discrimination against white citizens ought to be ended, but with Obama Democrats and Bush-McCain-Steele Republicans, our hope for justice may have to be through a third party.  &mdash;  -HM</p>

<p>Colleges and universities in California are twisting themselves into pretzels to admit clearly unqualified NAMs  &mdash;  discriminating and displacing Whites and Asians in the process.</p>
<p>This is infuriating not only because this student displaced a better qualified NAM but she is an illegal alien as well AND has NO right to attend a university funded by California taxpayers.</p>
<p>Also, this is a blatant violation of Prop 209 (Article I, Section 31(a) of the California Constitution) which &#8220;..voters enacted in 1996.  It prohibits discrimination or preferences by race or sex in public schools, contracts, and employment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pacific Legal Foundation reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;PLF has been contacted by a number of students, parents, and UC faculty who suspect that undergraduate admissions at UCLA are not race- and sex-neutral, as required by Proposition 209&hellip;To investigate on behalf of these concerned Californians, and to promote transparency in the state&rsquo;s public university system, PLF has asked for key documents from the admissions process, as the Public Records Act allows us to do&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>PLF has been the primary enforcer of Proposition 209 in California courts.</p>
<p>Among the things PLF is seeking:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Undergraduate applications, including essays&hellip;The identities of all applications readers, the scores they gave each application, and documents revealing why they decided to admit or reject each candidate. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re asking for these essays  to make sure that admissions officials aren&rsquo;t using these subjective evaluations as a way to bias the process in violation of Proposition 209&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://community.pacificlegal.org/Page.aspx?pid=727</p>
<p>Hope this article gives PLF more ammunition.</p>
<p>BTW:  This organization is fighting the good fight against the PC gestapo and is worthy of any and all donations.</p>

		<p>This makes me sick! Another damned parasite thinking she has the moral right to feed off the American economy. A parasite annoyed at not being able to get every conceivable tax-payer funded freebie she and her tribe can ask for. Then adding insult to injury, competing WITH REAL AMERICANS in the job market, for scarcer and scarcer jobs!!!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we have enough Americans realizing and understanding just what continuous immigration is doing to our country&hellip;? The incalculable harm of hundreds of thousands of AMERICAN PEOPLE, forced to compete with aliens for what rightfully should be American jobs&hellip; going to American people. American workers of every job description and title&hellip; passed over by the corporations preferring to hire Pakistanis and Hindus&hellip; fresh from the airport because they&rsquo;ll be glad to take a displaced American&rsquo;s job&hellip; even at HALF the American&rsquo;s wages. Mexicans swarming over the border by the millions&hellip; their children and grandchildren pushing OUR own out of jobs. Let a Mexican work his/her way into a supervisory or management position&hellip; and watch them HIRE ONLY MEXICANS! Something I, and probably many others, have seen too often.</p>

		<p>If you substituted a poor white girl into this heart-wrenching story, would anyone read it or care?  There are millions of white people, with much better, more-deserving grades, struggling just as hard to get through college, working at minimum wage jobs.</p>
<p>As far as the evil Aryan white sorority sister&rsquo;s snub goes, well, millions of white girls also get snubbed by them every year during rush week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t take it personally.  They want to be around other girls who are most like themselves.  That&rsquo;s their right to do so.  There are plenty of Hispanic clubs for Ms. Illegale to join if she wants.</p>

<p>Nice racial angle by the writer, Mr. Song.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Asians are the dominant group at UCLA, and are close-knit.  Were they handing out fliers to De La Cruz?  Of course not.  But the &#8220;blond sorority sister&#8221; makes for good copy.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to slam the girl.  It&rsquo;s OUR government that allowed her mom to come here.  It&rsquo;s OUR government that let her go to school here.  It&rsquo;s OUR government that let her into UCLA when her academic abilities were far short of what was necessary.  Everywhere she went, she was extended the rights of citizenship.  If, at any time, she ever heard that there was something wrong with her being here, OUR media and OUR intellectuals told her that being anti-immigration was racist and evil.  Why in the world would she ever imagine that she didn&rsquo;t really belong here?  She is, in fact, an innocent victim.  She no more deserves ridicule or abuse than any White girl who finds herself on the wrong side of history.<br>
      Send her back to Mexico?  Yes, but we oughtn&rsquo;t be any crueler than necessary.  The villains here are the American elite trash that let things get this far.  </p>

		<p>We are supposed to feel sorry for someone who sneaks into the country and tries to sneak into the system and hopes to take a job - probably a government job with generous Affirmative Action policies toward hiring Hispanics - since she will likely be interviewed by a Hispanic who got there before her - with all the usual benefits.  Then, she will consider herself a special success story - with her follow up stories shared for the purpose of encouraging others in a &#8220;similar situation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>ACTUALLY   &mdash;   this is a good thing for middle class whites!  </p>
<p>De La Cruz obviously took the place of a more qualified white.  That white will go to a community college, and get the basics out of the way.  Realistically, Calculus 101 is Calculus 101 no matter where you take it.</p>
<p>In a year or two, De La Cruz will drop out of UCLA, and the more qualified white will transfer in.  This will be easier, because UCLA has to fill De La Cruz&rsquo;s slot.</p>
<p>UCLA gets the benefit of the &#8220;diversity&#8221; De La Cruz brings when calculating student body statistics.  The white that should have been admitted all along gets to graduate with a degree from UCLA and saves a few tuition bucks.  It&rsquo;s De La Cruz who gets punked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for the day that minority groups start bringing lawsuits against universities for &#8220;predatory admissions.&#8221; Just like they forced banks to lend money to people who could never pay it back, then turned on them when the loans went bad, I predict they&rsquo;ll bring lawsuits against universities who took the tuition money of students they knew could never gradutate.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Is this a joke article? I didn&rsquo;t know the LA Times was a satirical publication.</p>
<p>How can the LA Times sell enough papers to stay in business when &ldquo;The Onion&rdquo; is given away for free?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Anonymous at 6:29 AM on February 3</p>
<p>I was think the same thing.  Is the author actually trying to drum up sympathy for Ms. De La Cruz?  He seems to make it obvious that she is not well-qualified for admission. </p>
<p>If it is the intent of the university officials to &#8220;find the best students&#8221;, they did not do so, unless it is to find the best illegal immigrant students, rejecting a far beter qualified one in the process.  What a joke, but not funny at all.</p>

		<p>Strange that Mr. Song, a Chinaman, is dissing whtie folks with his &#8220;sorority girl&#8221; smartmouth.  </p>
<p>White gentiles are way underrepresented at UCLA just as they are at Harvard. </p>
<p>Jews are extremely over-represented at UCLA, Asians (like Mr. Song) are way over-represented, and white Christians are underrepresented.</p>
<p>If anything he should be thumping on the Jews, Chinese and Koreans.</p>

<p>Yes, I also must give credit to the LAT for acknowledging that this kid is in over her head.  She would be overwhelmed at any competitive school, but UCLA has a quarter system (10 week term) rather than 18-week semesters.  The pace and the workload are intense.  I&rsquo;m also impressed that they referred to her an an illegal, instead of &#8220;undocumented&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know there were any blondes left at UCLA? That part has to be made up. Just take a stroll through campus sometime, it looks like Peking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous:</p>
<p>Among white UCLA alumni like myself, we like to say that U.C.L.A. = University of Caucausians Lost in Asians</p>
<p>In certain areas of the campus, though, it&rsquo;s University of Communist Latino Activists.  (This story is evidence.)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Notice how Mr Song (a Chinese?) has to put in a slam at the blonde sorority girl? The MSM won&rsquo;t even tell us if a killer is Black, but a White girl who allegedly yanked back a flier must be racially outed.</p>
<p>Posted by Schoolteacher at 9:24 PM on February 2 &#8220;</p>
<p>I doubt that this even happened.  Bruin Walk is cluttered with all the racial identity (&#8220;cultural&#8221;) groups at the beginning of each term.  There&rsquo;s no room for the sororities, fraternities, honor societies, and pre-professional societies amid La Raza, the Korean Undergraduate Student Association, Vietnamese Cultural Association, etc.  Experiencing the politics of racial identity in my first quarter at UCLA is part of what turned me from an ultra-liberal vegan Kucinich supporter in 2004 to a Ron Paul hardliner in 07/08.</p>

<p>Not true because most of the illegals actually transfer in.  The argument for diversity is enriching the classroom experience, but the AA admits are always lost, and instead focus their energy on La Raza, whining about Aztlan, babbling on about being underrepresented, and generally mau mauing.</p>
<p>The only good thing they do for white students at UCLA is make it clear that all the indoctrination about people of color being an easy explanation for our own failures is just that   &mdash;   indoctrination.  Actually, the opposite is true: whites are a convenient explanation for minorities&rsquo; failures, and this myth gets reinforced and then further propagated by the MSM.</p>

		<p>I remember when I was at the University of Washington, the Asian fraternities would always yank back the fliers when European Americans approached, and the administration never said anything.</p>
