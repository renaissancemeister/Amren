<h1>Wilders: &#8220;We Will Never Apologize for Being Free Men&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jihad Watch, February 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thank you very much for inviting me. And  &mdash;  to the immigration authorities  &mdash;  thank you for letting me into this country. It is always a pleasure to cross a border without being sent back on the first plane.</p>
<p>Today, the dearest of our many freedoms is under attack all throughout Europe. Free speech is no longer a given. What we once considered a natural element of our existence, our birth right, is now something we once again have to battle for.</p>
<p>As you might know, I will be prosecuted, because of my film Fitna, my remarks regarding Islam, and my view concerning what some call a &#8216;religion of peace&rsquo;. A few years from now, I might be a criminal.</p>
<p>Whether or not I end up in jail is not the most pressing issue; I gave up my freedom four years ago. I am under full-time police protection ever since. The real question is: will free speech be put behind bars? And the larger question for the West is: will we leave Europe&rsquo;s children the values of Rome, Athens and Jerusalem, or the values of Mecca, Teheran and Gaza?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, I come before you to warn of a great threat. It is called Islam. It poses as a religion, but its goals are very worldly: world domination, holy war, sharia law, the end of the separation of church and state, slavery of women, the end of democracy. It is NOT a religion, it is an political ideology. It demands your respect, but has no respect for you.</p>
<p>There might be moderate Muslims, but there is no moderate Islam. Islam will never change, because it is built on two rocks that are forever, two fundamental beliefs that will never change, and will never alter. First, there is the Quran, Allah&rsquo;s personal word, uncreated, forever, with orders that need to be fulfilled regardless of place or time. And second, there is al-insal al-kamil, the perfect man, Muhammad the role model, whose deeds are to be imitated by all Muslims. And since Muhammad was a warlord and a conqueror we know what to expect. Islam means submission, so there cannot be any mistake about it&rsquo;s goal. That&rsquo;s a given. It&rsquo;s fact.</p>
<p>This is Europe 2009. Muslim settlers calling for our destruction, and free speech on trial. All this is the outcome of a sick and evil ideology, the ideology that is weakening us, the surrender ideology of cultural relativism. It believes that all cultures are equal, and therefore Islam deserves an equal place in the West. It is their duty, the left thinks, to facilitate Islam. This way the cultural relativists paradise comes within reach and we will all be happy, and sing kumbaya.</p>
<p>The forces of Islam couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Islam being facilitated by government is their agenda too. But they see it as jizya, the money dhimmis pay in order not to be killed or raped by their Muslim masters. Therefore, they happily accept the welfare cheque or the subsidies for their mosque or the money governments donate to their organizations.</p>
<p>This is just one example of cultural relativists and Muslim settlers having the same agenda. There is another. Islam considers itself a religion and therefore we are not permitted to criticize it. The left agrees. Although it hated Christianity for decades, now that Islam appears on the scene, they suddenly change course and demand &#8216;respect&rsquo; for something they call a religion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This all culminates in a third coming-together: nor the left nor Islam is in favor of criticism. In fact, given the opportunity, they would simply outlaw it. Multiculturalism is the left&rsquo;s pet project. It is actually their religion. Their love of it is so great, if you oppose it, it must be hate. And if you say it, it is labeled hate speech. Now here is something the Islam can agree on.</p>
<p>This is the essence of my short introduction today: where the left and Islam come together, freedom will suffer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, if the Wall Street Journal has the moral clarity to see that my prosecution is the logical outcome of our disastrous, self-hating, multiculturalists immigration policies, then why can&rsquo;t the European liberal establishment see the same thing? Why aren&rsquo;t they getting at least a little bit scared by the latest news out of, for example, the UK. News that tells that the Muslim population in Britain is growing ten times as fast as the rest of society. Why don&rsquo;t they care?</p>
<p>The answer is: they don&rsquo;t care because they are blinded by their cultural relativism. Their disdain of the West is so much greater than the appreciation of our many liberties. And therefore, they are willing to sacrifice everything. The left once stood for women rights, gay rights, equality, democracy. Now, they favour immigration policies that will end all this. Many even lost their decency. Elite politicians have no problem to participate in or finance demonstrations where settlers shout &#8220;Death to the Jews&#8221;. Seventy years after Auschwitz they know of no shame.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I suggest to defend freedom in general and freedom of speech in particular. I propose the withdrawal of all hate speech legislation in Europe. I propose a European First Amendment. In Europe we should defend freedom of speech like you Americans do. In Europe freedom of speech should be extended, instead of restricted. Of course, calling for violence or unjustly yelling &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theatre have to be punished, but the right to criticize ideologies or religions are necessary conditions for a vital democracry. As George Orwell once said: &#8220;If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let us defend freedom of speech and let us gain strength and work hard to become even stronger. Millions think just like you and me. Millions think liberty is precious. That democracy is better than sharia. And after all, why should we be afraid? Our many freedoms and our prosperity are the result of centuries of endeavour. Centuries of hard work and sacrifice. We do not stand alone, and we stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Late December 1944 the American army was suddenly faced with a last-ditch effort by the Germans. In the Ardennes, in the Battle of the Bulge, Hitler and his national-socialists fought for their last chance. And they were very successful. Americans faced defeat, and death.</p>
<p>In the darkest of winter, in the freezing cold, in a lonely forest with snow and ice as even fiercer enemies than the Nazi war machine itself, the American army was told to surrender. That might be their only chance to survive. But General McAuliffe thought otherwise. He gave the Germans a short message. This message contained just four letters. Four letters only, but never in the history of freedom was a desire for liberty and perseverance in the face of evil expressed more eloquently than in that message. It spelled N-U-T-S. &#8220;Nuts&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I suggest we walk in the tradition of giants like General McAuliffe and the American soldiers who fought and died for the freedom of my country and for a secular and democratic Europe, and we tell the enemies of freedom just that. NUTS! Because that&rsquo;s all there is to it. No explanations. No beating around the bush. No caveats.</p>
<p>Our enemies should know: we will never apologize for being free men, we will never bow for the combined forces of Mecca and the left. And we will never surrender. We stand on the shoulders of giants. There is no stronger power than the force of free men fighting for the great cause of liberty. Because freedom is the birthright of all man.<br>

			<p>The well known romantic philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once posited that &#8220;God is dead&#8221; in the hopes that western man would be freed from the seemingly anti-human moral straightjacket of Christianity. Free of Christian morality, Man would become &#8220;Super-Man&#8221;. Instead, freed of Christianity, man became spineless man. Once life was reduced to a finite term of years, survival of the individual became the main purpose of life. So instead of brave leaders we get subservient bootlickers. This is Nietzsche&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
<p>Note the whining helplessness of this so-called &#8220;rightist&#8221; European leader. Wait for mommy government to fight his fight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Muslims are exhorted to be fruitful and multiply, to endure hardship in this world to prepare for the next world. Sort of like the old discredited Catholic civilization of Europe that once defeated them.</p>
<p>It is all the fault of the &#8220;Left&#8221; you see. They have forgotten such time honored principals as gay rights and womens&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p>This pseudo-man is part of the problem. Not the solution.</p>
<p>He may be of service if he would find some of his clueless buddies and emancipated women and gays to translate Nietzsche and Derrida and Focault and the rest of the &#8220;Great&#8221; western nihilist philosophers into Arabic so we can export all of this destructive trash to our enemies while we get our house in order.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Every American (and European) should print this out, tape it to the wall and boldly repeat it, out loud, every morning and evening. <br>
As usual, the TRUE ENEMY is &#8220;Liberalism&#8221;&hellip;Secular Humanism, Marxism. <br>
This is the disease that has infected the western world. It could easily be fatal. History is filled with the fall of mighty empires. <br>
If we weren&rsquo;t being held back by this mental disease we would have invaded and conquered all of the middle east right after September 11, just as we did Japan in 1941. <br>
To defeat our enemies, we MUST first defeat Liberalism. <br>
How? Their greatest weapons are their control of the media and education. They must be attacked there first. Everyone must come to understand the schools and newspapers and TV are merely instruments of indoctrination, instruments of our own destruction&#8221;. </p>

I would agree that what we have on display here would seem to be Geert Wilder&rsquo;s ignorance. We&rsquo;ve all &#8216;drunk from the cool aid&rsquo; however, to one degree or another. The younger the citizen the more we&rsquo;ve been exposed to this &#8216;evil&rsquo;, backwards ideology. Is Wilders simply facing facts, and attempting to appeal to the public the best way he feels he can, or is he a part of the problem? Or is he simply another agent of the state? I do believe the solution will have to come from the inside and not from the outside.</p>
<p>White nationalism is the future in North America. As the white population declines while every other race grows reality will begin to set in. As extinction looms closer and closer white women will also become &#8216;white nationalists&rsquo;. The question becomes, what to do about the Johny come latelies? One white nationalist described it as the final &#8216;panic to reach the lifeboats&rsquo;. This doesn&rsquo;t apply to Geert Wilder but more to those in the previous story &#8216;upset obama&rsquo;s plan may kick out too many illegals&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not optimistic about the timetable, but we do need to begin keeping track of these people. The paper trail is easier to follow than ever, but it will take some work. I don&rsquo;t say this to hunt them down. Prosecute them. For revenge. And not in an effort to frighten anyone or change their opinions, or coerce them. Not as any kind of effort at &#8216;justice&rsquo; at all. I simply don&rsquo;t want them in my country.   </p>

			<p>The common people in England already grow quite restless against their government&rsquo;s stupidly naive &#8216;one-worlder&rsquo; social experiments letting in a flood of belligerent immigrants who take their jobs and progressively debase their culture.</p>
<p>If there is any turn back to the higher values of their civilizations among European peoples, I suspect it will begin among the English &#8220;John Bulls&#8221; first.  </p>

			<p>Liberalism/Multiculturalism is by far the greatest enemy of western society.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MSM is filled with the same kind of Janissaries as yesteryear, however in this occupation, instead of swords and horses, the traitors are armed with the sheer, mind-numbing hatred of their cultural Marxist ideology.</p>
<p>They may look &#8216;like one of us,&rsquo; but they are absolutely against us, trained from birth to reflexively hate their civilization and traditional values.&#8221;</p>

			<p>      Disagree Michael. Yeah Dutch Culture, like all Western<br>
European Culture is way too Statist. And being a man of his cul-<br>
ture, he states his case in these terms. But, make no mistake,<br>
all ideology aside, Geert Wilder is a brave man. I don&rsquo;t know <br>
you or anyone can say differently. He has risked everything: <br>
peace, solitude, reputation, career, and his very life. Unlike<br>
our friends, we can&rsquo;t choose our comrades-they come as they are.<br>
Even more distasteful at least to me: the DaDa kitten killer Theo<br>
Van Gogh, and the Gay Warrior Pim Fortuyn. But Gay or not, For-<br>
tuyn was a very serious and charismatic man. The Enemy knew this<br>
even if you don&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>To those of you decrying Wilders&rsquo; support for gay and women rights, you seem to be missing the point.  The Dutch have a right to their own culture in their own country, however much you disagree.  Likewise, the Muslims have a right to their culture in their countries, no matter how backward it may seem to us.  Unless we acknowledge the sovereign rights of these countries, we can&rsquo;t righteously argue for sovereignty in the USA.</p>

			<p>I hope that all Amren folks, watched Rush&rsquo;s speech last night!! It was great!! He hit most points very well, but we need more than speeches&hellip;we need more people who think as we do in order to save this country of ours.  The liberals are running the show, and running our country into the dirt.  We should set aside ONE holiday of prayer for our nation&hellip;..put back the rules that are really in our tramped on Constitution.  Put God back in the schools and run the commies out.  Put the ten Commandments back in view where they belong.  Take out holidays like MLK day and put in Save our Nation day.  Make it a holiday where all folks go to Church and pray all day long to bring our nation back the way it SHOULD BE. As always&hellip;.God help us all!!</p>

<p>&gt; I could not disagree with you more on this point.  The retreat from Church dominated European governing freed Europe from religious wars and religious persecutions.  But the seeds of softness lie in the New Testament, not Nietzche&rsquo;s philosopy.  Nietzche also said that most people required religion and the supermen who did not require superstition for psychological safety would lead.  That has not really happened yet in the U.S. and is failing in Europe because of misplaced Marxist thinking.  But is it also failing not because the West is spineless, but because it has assumed, wrongly, that the rest of the world would see reason and join in with the West.  But the rest of the world has only come to plunder the wealth of the West. </p>
<p>In the Islamlic world, it is 1260, not 2009.  That is what so many critics of the West keep failing to recognize and you are failing to realize this as well.</p>

I really worry when people like you, - how about the last eight years where conservatives drove the country deeper in the dirt than any other nation in history!  But Rush and these blow hards have the solution once again!  You are so misinformed concerning the Constitution (you probably never read it) so misinformed/uninformed about American colonial and early state history that you can spout this sort of nonsense.  One thing I can guarantee you; God has never and will never take a hand in any of this for one simple reason - GUESS.</p>
<p>I want to see the White race survive, but whenever I read stuff like this I wonder if we Whites are nearly as intelligent as we claim or capable of survival.  You would repeat the last 500 years!  But we will never survive if we don&rsquo;t figure out how to survive without the old failed models - that is one thing of which I am sure.<br>

			<p>2 points:</p>
<p>1) homophobia &amp; contempt for women are MUSLIM traits, centuries out of date in the west.</p>
<p>So is anti-semitism.</p>
<p>Its silly to be mad at Europe for being a secular, democratic, modern, enlightened and scientific society.</p>
<p>Europeans are as just amazed at US-American anti-Darwinism as they are by Muslim medievalism. </p>
<p>If Europe defeats the Muslim menace, it will NOT be to live like US-American, but like modern Europeans.</p>
<p>2) multiculturalism isn&rsquo;t leftist, socialist, communist, or marxist.</p>
<p>Left = rights for workers vis the power of capital. </p>
<p>Big capital is very comfortable with multiculturalism, gives them cheap global labor. </p>

			<p>Islam is nothing more than an evil cult. We should never have been fighting  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which have done nothing but drain our country financially and kill our  soldiers. Instead, long ago we should have taken a defensive approach. We should have sealed our borders and used our soldiers on our north and especially southern border to guard against terrorists etc. entering the US. We should have stopped allowing muslims to enter the USA either through our borders or our aiports as well as not having allowed muslim immigration into the USA and sending all muslim non-citizens here back home. Undercover agents should have been sent to muslim mosques(which can double as poltical organizations and terrorist fronts) here and if any talk of jihad etc. is found, the mosques should have been shut down and its&rsquo; memebers stripped of their US citizenship and sent home. Had this been done, there would have been no Sept 11th. Even if there were no threats of terrorism, muslim beliefs are simply incompatible with our culture.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip; and pray all day long to bring our nation back the way it SHOULD BE. As always&hellip;.God help us all!!..&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Kassie</p>
<p>Prayer &#8216;all day long&rsquo; will accomplish exactly nothing to save our country. </p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Instead, long ago we should have taken a defensive approach&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No, we, long ago, should have taken an OFFENSIVE approach, using unmitigated deadly force without mercy to protect the country WE built, the treasure WE accumulated, OUR people and the culture and lifestyle WE created. </p>
<p>Securing our borders is one facet of a large, offensive war we must wage against the entrenched anti-White Marxists who are in charge of the schools, the MSM and the government itself, those who are encouraging the wholesale assault on our liberties, culture and way of life.  </p>
<p>And&hellip; is &#8216;taking back our country&rsquo; still possible?  This question MUST be asked.  Is it still possible to overthrow the Marxist masters and take control of the country we created?</p>
<p>Taking a defensive approach is exactly what has led us to where we are today  &mdash;  emasculated, floundering, and struggling to hold on to ground that we are rapidly losing.  </p>
<p>Taking a defensive position, rather than a pro-active position has allowed the enemy to set the agenda  &mdash;  and we have been reactive in the face of this agenda.  </p>
<p>To paraphrase Joseph Farah (on the failure of conservatism):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.It&rsquo;s time not for timidity and to be always-on-the-defense. It&rsquo;s time to be proactive, time for a much more radical, bold and courageous approach..one not easily hijacked by people claiming to be conservatives when they are clearly not&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This movement was the radical revolutionary movement of our Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>Do enough of us have the will to band together, as it will take strength in numbers to succeed? Is there enough time left before the leftist agenda is enacted and we are silenced and dis-armed and dissent will not be allowed?</p>
<p>Unbelievable that it&rsquo;s come to this point, that so many Americans rolled over, drank the Kool Aid and are content as the liberties our ancestors shed blood for are stripped from us and the government becomes Big Brother.</p>
<p>Was Marx right?  I&rsquo;m beginning to think this country WILL break up along racial/ethnic lines and that maybe this is the best future and &#8216;hope&rsquo; for our people.</p>

			<p>If Europe defeats the Muslim menace, it will NOT be to live like US-American, but like modern Europeans.</p>
<p>Europe will not defeat the muslims unless they are prepared to find a &#8220;Final Solution&#8221; and I don&rsquo;t think they are YET!!</p>

			<p>If free speech is allowed in Europe, then the truth will keep being said about not only about women enslaving, blood &amp; conquest Islam and its billion plus Muslim dupes but about blacks. Then enough of the people will wake up and then the leftist sell-out political powers that be will lose their positions of power &amp; wealth to right wing parties. Hence these powers won&rsquo;t allow a free speech constitutional law. Instead they will keep trying to fool the public into thinking they have free speech, but of course it&rsquo;s only &#8220;free speech&#8221; as they define it. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Once life was reduced to a finite term of years, survival of the individual became the main purpose of life. So instead of brave leaders we get subservient bootlickers. This is Nietzsche&rsquo;s legacy.&#8221;<br>

I would not be so quick to condemn Neitzsche!    It was NOT Nietzsche or his disciples who won W.W.2 and subsequently imposed their stifling rule on the Netherlands (and on all the rest of Europe).   <br>
You&rsquo;ve put the cart before the horse!   It was not Nietzsche who brought all of this about.   It was his DEFEAT that brought it about.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We should set aside ONE holiday of prayer for our nation&hellip;&hellip; Put God back in the schools and run the commies out. Put the ten Commandments back in view where they belong. Take out holidays like MLK day and put in Save our Nation day. Make it a holiday where all folks go to Church and pray all day long to bring our nation back the way it SHOULD BE. As always&hellip;.God help us all!!&#8221;<br>

Will all folks HAVE to go to chuch? What happens if we don&rsquo;t?  Dunking? Sounds like the New England Puritans all over again.  </p>
<p>Thanks, Kassie;  you can have your holiday and pray all day if you like,  but count me out!   God won&rsquo;t help you.  (Has he shown any sign of it so far?)  I believe that &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221;   Not those who spend all day praying, and waiting  for Him to fix their problems for them.</p>
