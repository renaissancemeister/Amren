<h1>Gang Dealt Blow in Colorado Busts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judi Villa, Rocky Mountain News, February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Law enforcement officials say they have crippled a notoriously violent street gang as its members were attempting to expand into Colorado and establish a foothold here for drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Eight members of the MS-13 gang were arrested Tuesday in Colorado and California, and police are searching for another four people. In addition, seven people were already in custody before Tuesday, and one has been deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to get it at the front end and try and stop it before they got the good foothold,&#8221; said Deputy Denver Police Chief Michael Battista. &#8220;I think by taking down these individuals in communities in the Denver metro area, we did accomplish that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will have an impact on slowing their growth, if not stopping it in Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MS-13 members specifically targeted Denver because they believed law enforcement here was &#8220;soft,&#8221; said James Davis, special agent in charge of the FBI in Denver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A multi-agency gang task force began investigating MS-13 in 2006. In addition to obtaining indictments against 20 people, authorities seized 10 pounds of methamphetamine, 2.3 kilograms of cocaine, 124 grams of heroin, 12 firearms and $3,300 in cash.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those arrested face charges that include conspiracy to distribute illicit drugs and possession with the intent to distribute. Among those arrested were Gerardo Lopez, 31, of Denver, and Jose Garcia-Sanchez, 26, of Aurora, who are believed to be gang leaders.</p>
<p>If convicted on the drug distribution charges, the gang members could face 20 years to life in prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gang, at least in this particular area, was in its infancy,&#8221; Gaouette [David Gaouette, acting United States Attorney for the District of Colorado] said. &#8220;If you take out 20 members of a gang that is just getting started here, I think you can certainly say we put a dent in it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MS-13</p>
<p>* Who they are: Members of Mara Salvatrucha, MS-13, are mostly Salvadoran nationals and first-generation Salvadoran-Americans. They also include Hondurans, Guatemalans, Mexicans and other Central and South American immigrants.</p>
<p>* What the name means: Mara is gang, Salva refers to El Salvador, and Trucha means, &#8220;look out or beware.&#8221; The number 13 is homage to the letter M, 13th letter in the alphabet, and signifies the Mexican Mafia.</p>
<p>* Membership: 7,000 to 10,000 members in at least 42 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>* Criminal activity: Drug distribution, murder, rape, prostitution, robbery, home invasions, immigration offenses, kidnapping, carjackings/auto thefts and vandalism. Most of these crimes are exceedingly violent.<br>

			<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t they think the law enforcement in big city Mayor John Hickenlooper and Governor Bill Ritter Denver is weak?  Like the FBI and other open borders quislings in ICE is any better?  I bet none of the illegal aliens arrested get deported.</p>
<p>Also, these arrests and maybe convictions won&rsquo;t really solve the problem.  It&rsquo;ll be a few years that new MS-13 gangsters coalesce.  It&rsquo;s a bandage on a hemorrhage.  Not only from the younger Hispanics already in Colorado, but the new ones yet to come from Latin America.  </p>

			<p>As long as the War on Some Drugs continues, there will continue to be small battles won - but the war cannot be won.  The root cause of much violent crime is the War on Some Drugs.</p>

			<p>As main stream print media goes this article is a considerable improvement over the typical write ups on this subject matter. The Kolorado Kool Aid Kops are the over self-congratulatory soft peddlers here.  </p>
<p>That said however, this tripe of: &#8220;Among those arrested were Gerardo Lopez, 31, of Denver, and Jose Garcia-Sanchez, 26, of Aurora, who are believed to be gang leaders.&#8221; needs to be eradicated from the AP style guide. These two pendejos are no more &#8220;of Denver&#8221; or &#8220;of Aurora&#8221; than I am of Lancaster or Hamburg.</p>

			<p>This story is misleading, because there&rsquo;s been several news reports on T.V. from Lou Dobbs, Glenn Beck and Fox News, as well as the US military, indicating that Mexico is on the brink of takeover by the cartel and civil war.</p>
<p>A border sheriff, named West, I believe it was, told Glenn Beck two days ago that the drug gangs are now in the US and have been for quite some time.  Asked why the he thinks the US isn&rsquo;t protecting the border to keep these people out, the sheriff answered that he doesn&rsquo;t have to say what he &#8220;thinks,&#8221; but what he &#8220;knows,&#8221; because it&rsquo;s common knowledge in his part of the country that drug cartel money is influencing some politicians in Washington right now.</p>
<p>Beck asked if really thought that was true.  The sheriff answered that it&rsquo;s so obvious to him and others that it&rsquo;s an absolutely foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>That makes about the third reliable report from someone reputable saying exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>So it appears as if these Colorado gang and drug bust stories are just smoke and mirrors to make the public think the US authorities are making headway on the gang problem and the war on drugs.</p>
<p>If drugs aren&rsquo;t legalized, there&rsquo;s a good chance the US itself may become a narco republic, because the drug cartels will have more monetary power than any country in the Western Hemisphere, while the others are in deep depression.</p>

			<p>Thanks to our brilliant politicians, we now have &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation which means the penalty for victimizing whites is less than the other way around. So if I am a murderous minority thug I will target whites because the penalties are less. In essence, our laws target whites! When will this madness end?</p>

			<p>What suckers these gangs must consider Americans!! What absolute SUCKERS!! The time was not long ago, that no gang, wherever they were from would have dared to do this in lawabiding America. Even the Mafia, by the 1960&rsquo;s had most of their fangs removed. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my opinion of the ABC show &#8220;Homeland Security,&#8221; which the open borders crowd hates and Patriots love.  I think they all have it backwards.  The purpose of that show IMHO is to promulgate the false notion that the border/immigration/airport problem is far more under control than it actually is.  If so, why so many illegal aliens/drugs/9-11?  ABC&rsquo;s purpose is to neuter the right wing on immigration, to push the fiction that Bush/Obama have it all under control, as you see every Tuesday at 8/7c.</p>

			<p>I hate to be a pessimist here, but the US gang problem will *never* be solved in the foreseeable future. That is because Hispanic and to a lesser extent Black gang culture is for all intents and purposes permanent, as is probably their ghettos and possibly their dismal scholastic performance. I don&rsquo;t like Thomas Chittum one bit, but the previous sentence was one great thought that I took away from Civil War 2. Come on, people, think! The gangs and *never* going to go away. When everyone of us is on their deathbed, we will be to look out the window and see an America as overrun with gangs as ever.</p>
<p>I speak from Ground Zero. I live in an apartment complex in Mexifornia overrun by Hispanics and especially illegals. It&rsquo;s Norteno territory to the extent that I prominently wear my &#8220;N&#8221; tennis shoes a lot. It&rsquo;s not cool to root for the other side. I&rsquo;ve known quite a few of these characters personally, and though they can be likeable, their effect on society is not good. And looking out my window, there is no way when I die in 30 yrs or so if lucky, that this problem will be 1% better.</p>
<p>Forget Permanent Democratic Majority. Get ready for Permanent Gangland America.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, much of the SouthWest is now a La Raza gangster &#8220;paradise.&#8221; The whites have retreated along the coast and into enclaves. </p>

			<p>Of course Denver would attract MS-13 members.  It is a sanctuary city, so they would never have to worry about deportation after arrests for petty offenses.</p>
