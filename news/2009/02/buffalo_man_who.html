<h1>Buffalo Man Who Launched TV Network to Show Muslims in Positive Light Arrested  &mdash;  for Beheading His Wife</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Mitchell, Editor &amp; Publisher (Northbrook, Illinois), February 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A prominent Buffalo area businessman who founded the BridgesTV network to improve the image of Muslims in the U.S. has been arrested and charged with murdering his estranged wife  &mdash;  by beheading her at his company&rsquo;s office in Orchard Park, N.Y., on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police have charged the husband, Muzzammil Hassan, 44, with second-degree murder in the death of Aasiya Z. Hassan, 37.</p>
<p>In its logo, BridgesTV boasts of &#8220;connecting people through understanding&#8221; via its dish network available in several states. Its Web site quotes comments about the company by Jay Leno, Brian Williams and others, plus a screen shot of a CNBC interview with Hassan conducted by Maria Bartiromo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NPR&rsquo;s &#8220;All Things Considered&#8221; profiled the Hassans in 2004. The segment opened, &#8220;A new cable network for Muslim-Americans is up and running in Detroit. Bridges TV says it wants to inform and entertain Muslims and, at the same time, give viewers who aren&rsquo;t Muslims a glimpse into their culture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police says the wife had an order of protection from the man. A murder weapon has not yet been recovered.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Cable network hoped to give Americans another glimpse into Muslim culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The network did give us another glimpse into Muslim culture.  It showed us even the higher ups are no different than their common riff raff.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that until now.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping they can launch another network so I can learn even more. </p>

<p>It looks like Mr. Hassan has succeeded then.  Thanks for the incite.  <br>

			<p>We can file this along with the many, many other stories of violent acts committed by Minorities that the liberal press will buy and obscure, in order to further their own agenda. Thank you, AMREN, or those of us outside Northbrook would likely not have heard this story. </p>

			<p>If he exhibited the same passion in his business endeavors rather than exhibiting them in killing his wife, he would have made a go of it.  Now we await a new Muslim network, with a new owner and his new wife.</p>
<p>We await with baited breath&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, Mr. Hassan, has the little incident with your wife put a strain on the relationship with the in-laws?&#8221;</p>

			<p>OMG this one story so perfectly captures the entire dystopic PC milieu we face when dealing with the horrible problem of Muslims vis-avis the rest of the civilized world!!</p>
<p>I need not press my case further.  In the future, starting today, whenever I find myself having to argue with some liberal doofus about the real dilemma confronting us in dealing with the media lies about multiculturalism, and specifically the psychotically muderous nature of Islam, etc., all I have to do is present this article.  It basically just says it all.<br>

<p>I have seen what the extremist muslims would do, it is not something for the faint of heart to see, I have many, many pictures of what they can and DO do.</p>

			<p>So a man who founded a TV network to show Mudlims in a positive way is arrested for beheading his wife. If this gets lots of publicity, expect Leftists to repeat the same old canards about &#8216;islam being a religion of peace&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity is a  stregth.&rsquo; </p>

<p>Way to go Invader Hassan, that sure &#8220;improves&#8221; my view of Muslims, particularly the Arab variety.</p>
<p>Maybe about 15 or so years ago, some white harlot married an Arab Muslim in the Detroit area and decided to divorce him. Same outcome, he cut off her head in their Allen Park home; he was, if I am not mistaken, on a &#8220;protection order&#8221; form the courts not to go near her. Apparently, he had taken to beating the whore and this was why she was divorcing him. </p>
<p>I remember my mother and aunt talking about it; my aunt informed my mother: &#8220;They still haven&rsquo;t found her head&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they ever did, but he fled the country for his native gutter in the sand while on bond!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>As the wife learned the hard way, Islam <i>is</i> a religion of peace   &mdash;   the peace of the grave.</p>
<p>Or to paraphrase Clinton, it depends on what the meaning of &#8220;peace&#8221; is.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s the surprise?  Just a good muslim doing the good work of believers throughout the world.</p>
<p>When will it ever occur to us that some cultures cannot coexist?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether to go to church this morning, play golf, or behead my wife, and as a Christian-American I&rsquo;ll certainly do two of the three.</p>

			<p>More likely than not this underqualified president will make some obnoxious, silly decisions, and in a couple of years probably his image will be degraded to a very low degree.</p>
<p>If he flubs by pushing this spending bill and the country goes into an even deeper depression with riots and gigantic civil upheavals he&rsquo;ll be known as the worst president in history, and he just might be forced to step down in disgrace.</p>
<p>If that happens, or anything even short of such a catastrophe, white people doing all this renaming are going to be regarded as abject fools.</p>
<p>Blacks, of course, will be stupidly trying to argue that he was a success, but he couldn&rsquo;t rise to his full potential because of white racism.</p>

			<p>Did they say why he did it? He might of had a good reason like she wanted a divorce, she commited adultery, or ate pork when its against their tradition. Ya know, normal stuff very society needs to do to their wives. Why didnt we adopt their ingenius plan when we came to the United States maybe our women wouldnt be so bad. Maybe O.J. wasnt such a bad guy after all, maybe he was just doing the right thing all along. And to think we patronized him for doing some we needed to do. (sarcasism)</p>

			<p>With the more third-world immigrants we admit to our country, the more we can expect in the way of crimes like this. Crimes like that Korean shooting up Virginia Tech. Crimes like that Black Caribbean Islander shooting up riders in commuter trains. WAKE UP, AMERICA! This is what the liberals appear to wish for us.</p>

			<p>This stuff is so sickening to Americans,lets say over 40, that it&rsquo;s hard to express your real feelings about it. There was a time in the United States, really not too long ago, that this type of story would have been national news. I mean, every network would have broadcast it in every state, Americans would have talked about it by the water cooler,etc., at home, with their friends and it would have been considered something surreal. Instead, it was reported by the MSM, with the usual muted tones and absolutely no examination of why cultures who do things like &#8220;behead&#8221; their wives, are even allowed into this nation. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!</p>
