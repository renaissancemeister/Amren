			<p>Every State Bar in the country was taken over by a feminazi, national lawyer&rsquo;s guild, ACLU communist white hating cabal more than 30 years ago.  The law schools were taken over by this cabal 60 years ago.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t look very &#8220;diverse&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;d be willing to step aside as President-Elect of the NYS Bar Association in fsvor of &#8220;a member of a racial or ethnic minority group&#8221; person.</p>
<p>Do as I say, not as I do!</p>

			<p>Must be a member of a minority group? Are whites even a majority in NY? Certainly not in NYC. Why not use truth in advertising and change this all to &#8216;non-white&rsquo;? Or &#8216;whites need not apply&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s the way it works, whether it&rsquo;s Harlem or Hoboken. </p>

			<p>Nice&hellip;post-racial age indeed!! The blatant nature of this type of discrimination would be shocking in its hypocrisy and audacity, except that it&rsquo;s all so predictable and typical. Yes, thank goodness we&rsquo;ve moved beyond race with the election of the High Potentate Obama! </p>

			<p> Long ago, I knew a very wise old man. He told me that knowledge plus understanding equaled wisdom.<br>
 He told that one day; open  blatant hostility and discrimination against the white man would be the norm. I had a hard time understanding my Grandfather when I was young. He never claimed to be a prophet, he was a lifelong student of history.<br>
 He told me that by studying history and keeping up with current events you could extrapolate from that and get a good idea about the future. He lived to the age of 92. I&rsquo;ve often wondered in the years since he died just how many more things he saw coming.</p>

			<p>Another reason why I let my 15-year membership in the NYSBA lapse.<br>
Actually, it&rsquo;s become a bit of a joke: &#8220;racial or ethnic minority&#8221; is not defined, and an argument can be made that in many (most) parts of New York State, whites are the &#8220;racial or ethnic minority.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Until Whites learn that our suffering and hardship (e.g., higher taxes, lower quality of life, longer working hours, enduring lower standards, higher exposure to crime, etc.) is directly related to the presence of minorities, we will continue to watch our race and our nation crumble around us. </p>
<p>My wife and I thank God each day that we chose not to have children.</p>
<p>&#8220;When will Whites fight back,&#8221; you ask? Well, nearly 50 percent of our race voted for a Black man, and then the Republican Party proudly selected a Black man to lead them. We have a lot farther to fall, my friends. A <b>lot</b> farther.</p>
<p>In 2005, Hurricane Katrina exposed New Orleans for what it really is. Now, Michael Steele has exposed the Republican Party for what it really is.</p>

			<p>Typical   &mdash;   and any white lawyer writing a letter of complaint to the state bar for excluding whites will find himself placed under a microscope while the state bar attempts to find grounds for proceedings to suspend or disbar him.  The state bar doesn&rsquo;t just discriminate in hiring, it also discriminates in disciplinary procedures as well.  Whites are always held to a much higher standard, while minorities are offered substance-abuse counseling, etc.</p>
<p>This country and its multi-culti, Affirmative Action,  proposition-nation nonsense is going straight to the dogs.  </p>

Some may believe this was done with malice aforethought but I believe it&rsquo;s likely the people involved in this have no sense of how wrong this is both legally and morally.</p>

<p>Sadly, I must agree.</p>
<p>It appears most of the whites in our once great nation, have partaken of the cultural marxist kool-aid, which will lead to the demise of our country.  It is as though I am surrounded by pod people.  Our schools, churches, civic organizations, workplaces, etc. are overrun with the PC/multiculti automatons who continue to chant &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;, even as our country goes down the toilet.</p>
<p>Besides fleeing the country which has been home to my family since the early 19th century, what is the solution?  Venting on a website is one thing, action quite another.  How do we spread the word and let other like minded individuals know they are not alone?  Where is our leader?  No one is willing to speak out and say &#8220;the emperor wears no clothes.&#8221; Until this happens, whites will continue to be kowtowed into nonaction.</p>
<p>I now fear hitting rock bottom is the only thing which will wake up the sheeple, and then it will be too late.</p>

			<p>good, no white lawyer has stood up for white rights in decades, they are all afraid and have joined the multi-cult train of thought, so let them get discriminated against. it is time these liberals got what they have championed. just like robert reich the other day saying that no white construction workers should be hired to fill all of the new jobs that will be created, the camera pans the room and one can see lots of white politicians listeneing, and none of them says a thing. when the mexicans are legalized, i will vote out every white politician in favor of a mexican politician. let the white politicians lose their job for not standing up for whites. thye deserve it.</p>

			<p>Right now, this is not really too much to worry about, because the numbers of incompetent minorities in the law are limited by objective criteria   &mdash;   the LSAT and law school grades.</p>
<p>However, let us not be complacent in thinking that these objective standards cannot also be attacked.  America is only continuing to put put along because we put so many minority criminals in jail.  This is because we still have, for the most part, fair and objective evaluation of guilt   &mdash;   i.e., it&rsquo;s still the case that if you go too far, you are going to jail regardless of the fact that you are black.</p>
<p>It is the high level of minority incarceration, as a direct result of our legal system actually being enforced, which is keeping us afloat.  </p>
<p>Mark my words:  If the LSAT is dropped or gutted, if law school grading is changed significantly, or if the bar exams are gutted to cater to minorities, our legal system _will_ fail, the guilty will no longer be incarcerated, and our nation _will_ enter a period of near-anarchy.</p>
<p>This will not happen so long as we maintain fair and objective standards, but the bellyaching about high minority incarceration rates is the beginning of a pressure that must not be countenanced.  It must be strenuously refuted that anything is unfair about the situation, and emphatically explained that the high number of minorities are there by their own doing, for the crimes they&rsquo;ve committed.</p>

			<p>Of course this is wrong and discriminatory against Whites.  But who is going to do anything about it?  Who is going to protest?  I doubt any White New York lawyer(&rsquo;s) would have the courage to say anything about it, or anyone else for that matter.  </p>

			<p>My law-school application process was a marathon of White guilty and reverse racism; it was perverse and unjust (thank God my grades and LSATs are strong enough that they cannot sweep me under the AA rug). </p>
<p>Whites, if State Bars and law-schools had their way, would never again be allowed to hold a JD without begging, on their knees, forgiveness for being White, and for everything any White person has ever done, to those poor poor Brown people. </p>
<p>It is a sad, sad state of affairs when those we are training to be truthful and just must first bow to anti-White propaganda in order to be allowed to practice.</p>

			<p>Be it wrong for me as a Limey to mention this but surely this letter breaks a law in the USA under &#8220;race discrimination&#8221;.  Surely all that has to be done is for an &#8220;ordinary citizen&#8221; to take the letter to the nearest police station and lay a charge, or to complin through the Senator or Congressman who represents that area?  Please stop writing complaints and do something positive about this seemingly criminal act.  It has to be against the US laws, and why should the non-whites get away with such actions.  Hoist them with their own petards.  Good luck.</p>

			<p>I am currently in law school and am constantly innundated with examples of exactly this type of behavior. At any given time the amount of scholarships and internships exclusively available to minorities are legion (and often not even applied for, thus creating pools of money which could be put to great use by any of the other law students, yet are unavailable because of their minority-only delegation), yet the rest of us have to practically stab each other in the back for similar opportunities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides fleeing the country which has been home to my family since the early 19th century, what is the solution?&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle, what has to happen is that Whites must single out one, large company and boycott them relentlessly. Relentlessly! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about standing outside their property with picket signs, I&rsquo;m talking about taking our stubborn resolve, as White people, and absolutely refusing to participate in any commerce with the company we decide to boycott. </p>
<p>There are many candidates deserving of the receiving end of this endeavor, but we have to organize and do it en masse. We have to boycott to the point that the company cries out in the media, &#8220;The racists are destroying our business! They&rsquo;ve singled us out and it&rsquo;s reflected in our revenue and earnings. They are targeting us because of our pro-diversity position! It&rsquo;s racism!&#8221; </p>
<p>We have to make the boycott grow and become a universal symbol of White unity. Avoid [insert company here] must become a symbol of White anger and White unity. Avoiding the targeted company should become as natural as breathing to all White people. </p>
<p>Other companies should look at the boycott and privately say, &#8220;My God! Thank God they are not boycotting that to our company!&#8221; Such conversations should become a common fear at their internal risk management meetings   &mdash;   &#8220;How to balance risk between multiculturalists and racists!&#8221; LOL.</p>
<p>Until now, White have cowered and have not given companies a need to fear a boycott from Whites. That must change.</p>
<p>In an advanced state of such a boycott, we may even be able to establish a private, non-profit insurance fund to help Whites who lose their jobs because of the boycott. </p>
<p>BTW, everything I am proposing suggests the use of peaceful activism, not violence or illegal methods.</p>
<p>We have to pick a company and drive it out of business, Belle, by refusing to purchase its products. We have to ruin them and move on to the next company. We have to go on boycotting and ruining companies until they stop supporting and advocating diversity and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>This is going to ultimately become very ugly, as it should, but it starts with White resolve and organization. I don&rsquo;t think enough Whites are suffering yet to participate. Not really, really suffering. Give it time.</p>
<p>Complaining on this website does not solve or acomplish anything. As I have before, I call on the leadership of Amren and CoCC to help us organize a large scale boycott. It&rsquo;s something that should be carefully planned and coordinated.</p>

<p>I remember a back to school JC Penney tv ad from a few years back that featured a rap song with offensive, innappropriate lyrics. Based on the coverage here I called and complained and could tell by the response of the woman on the other that she had been fielding them all day.</p>
<p>There are more of us than you think, the time for these mass-boycott type actions is now.</p>
