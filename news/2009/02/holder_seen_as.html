			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Johnson and Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, February 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, Eric H. Holder Jr.&rsquo;s swearing-in as the nation&rsquo;s first black attorney general and its top law enforcement official came weighted with heavy expectation that the system could change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Civil rights advocates are already outlining a long list of priorities, including changing laws that lead to disproportionate prison terms for blacks, ending racial profiling and stepping up the policing of discrimination in employment and housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing is that we have a person who gets it,&#8221; said Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP. &#8220;He understands that the purpose of incarceration is not just punishment and protection but it is also redemption. He understands that people shouldn&rsquo;t be targeted because of what they look like but because of what they do. He understands that enforcing civil rights serves the interest of law enforcement. It&rsquo;s not about what he looks like, it&rsquo;s about what he believes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holder will oversee civil rights enforcement, crime prevention and racial justice  &mdash;  issues with a broad impact and audience  &mdash;  among many competing priorities in an agency that also plays a central role in fighting terrorism and policing corporate abuse. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone who witnessed the civil rights movement and whose family members literally suffered through the evils of segregation, I hope I can bring a unique perspective to the department,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This department has played a historic role in civil rights over the years, and I owe it to those who came before me and to the American people I serve to oversee a vigorous enforcement program that deals with the realities we confront today.&#8221;</p>
<p>On issues of crime and punishment, Holder brings his background as a hard-nosed, law-and-order prosecutor. As a U.S. attorney in the District, he lobbied for tougher minimum sentences for drug offenders but later changed course on nonviolent criminals, according to Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a D.C.-based group that calls for changing the sentencing system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The black community&rsquo;s relationship with the department has long been complicated. The distrust of law enforcement organizations was increased by the FBI, which for years harassed and spied on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For criminal justice activists, a pressing concern has been sentencing disparities for convicts caught with crack cocaine versus powder cocaine. Possession of crack carries longer criminal penalties, and 80 percent of people prosecuted for crack offenses have been African American, according to the Sentencing Project. Obama has said repeatedly that he wants to end the sentencing disparity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sentence disparities have combined with social and economic factors to lead to the increasing number of African Americans in prison, a figure that has grown from 100,000 in 1954  &mdash;  the year of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s seminal school desegregation case  &mdash;  to 900,000 today, according to the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we look at the prison system, it&rsquo;s a much worse situation than we had seen before the rise of the modern-day civil rights movement,&#8221; said Mark Mauer, executive director of the group. &#8220;If current trends continue, one of every three black males today can expect to go to prison in their lifetime. It is one in every six for Hispanic men.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder seldom broaches the topic of race directly, but in a 1997 National Public Radio interview conducted soon after his appointment as the Justice Department&rsquo;s second in command, he shared a quote by the late Samuel Proctor, a pastor in Harlem, that he carried in his wallet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It says that blackness is another issue entirely apart from class in America,&#8221; Holder said. &#8220;No matter how affluent, educated and mobile a black person becomes, his race defines him more particularly than anything else.&#8221;<br>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;changing laws that lead to disproportionate prison terms for blacks, ending racial profiling and stepping up the policing of discrimination in employment and housing.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>We all know blacks are responsible for disproportionately high rates of violent crime when compared to whites so I don&rsquo;t know how &#8216;ending racial profiling&rsquo; is going to change anything unless they&rsquo;re not going to arrest criminals because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>About changing laws that give more sever terms to blacks, if it&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;d like to see this addressed and solved. I am tired of the claim that blacks get harsher sentences for similar crimes with similar criminal backgrounds. If it&rsquo;s not true, I&rsquo;d like to this this myth exposed and retired.</p>
<p>As for stepping up enforcement of discrimination, I want them to have a solid case, not &#8216;hearsay&rsquo; or &#8216;feeling&rsquo; discriminated against. This one could turn into a witch hunt.</p>

			<p>Good attorney general Holder can now do something about all the rapes of white women by black men.As you know each year 37000 white women are raped by black men while almost zero black women are raped by white men.HGe can also do something about all the other crimes mostly committed by blacks against whites. That&rsquo;s the change I would like to have the same privilege of walking safely through a black community the way blacks can walk through white communities.</p>

<p>Yes, it is their whole identity, and that makes it all the more hypocritical when they accuse whites of racism.</p>

			<p>Men are imprisoned at a far great rate than women. Is that because the system is sexist (genderist?), or is it because men behave in ways that causes them to be involved with the criminal &#8220;justice&#8221; system? Anyone with the IQ of an oyster knows the answer. I do not see anyone complaining about the disparity by sex. It should be obvious that some people will not face facts and realize that black men are far more often vicious criminals.</p>

<p>I would like to encourage all white readers of AR to volunteer<br>
to help move as many black families as possible into the neighborhoods of their fellow whites who had their yards decorated with &#8216;Obama-Biden 2008&rsquo; presidential campaign signs.</p>
<p>There are a few of those in my neighborhood, so I fully intend to do whatever I can to help put needy black families into the houses on both sides of them.  And, if my Obama loving white neighbors are really as blessed as they think they are, after helping to elect him - perhaps their white daughters will be lucky enough to get called on by the black sons of those families?</p>
<p>Great idea, huh?</p>

			<p>The only way you can change laws that mean disproportionate prison terms for black men is to have virtually no laws.  For as Jared Taylor has outlined in &#8220;The Color of Crime,&#8221; blacks disproportionately commit most violent and sometimes non-violent crimes.</p>

			<p>blacks in jail disproportionatally?  Great. Release tens of thousands of them to equalize with number of whites jailed. Then Holder&rsquo;s expensive home in DC gets burglarized, his wife raped. No problem. We shall overcome.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>In other words, money and power and position are still not enough! </p>
<p>This person - a child of West Indian immigrant parents, not even Americans who have lived here for generations - has attained a very large income, an extremely high position (which is an understatement!) and immense power &hellip; in order words,  this is OUR NEW RULING CLASS, quite literally, who will govern us and dictate to us how we shall live.</p>
<p>But yet   &mdash;  - despite achieving all that, it&rsquo;s STILL not enough!  Blackness, for him, remains another yet unrevolved issue.</p>
<p>What WILL be enough???  What does it take to satisfy these people?  For every concession we make, they have a new demand.</p>
<p>The answer is obvious, as others here have already pointed out.  It&rsquo;s access to your homes, your families, and your daughters. Nothing less will ever suffice.</p>

			<p>Holder and most non-whites get it about race being nature&rsquo;s prime identity for each of us.  It&rsquo;s mostly just some dumb whites who don&rsquo;t get it and who try to deny it.</p>
<p>Our white skin is not an afterthought or a paint job on a universal model human.  It is essential to who and what we are.  Not just because we look different because of our white skin, but because it makes us different in many ways that science is only now starting to understand. </p>
<p>Our super ability to produce Vitamin D is only one of the most obvious advantages our skin gives us in the survival game.</p>

A few of my neighbors are flaming Lib-tards and sometimes I get their mail by accident so I know their full names.<br>
I am going to search out every shady Black charity scam/organization I can find and sign them up by name and address.<br>
If my plan works, they will soon be inundated by mail and personal visits to thier door by every Black miscreant in town and elsewhere.<br>
They love diversity so much? let&rsquo;s see how much they like it when it&rsquo;s at thier front door constantly!!!!!</p>

			<p><em>&ldquo;When we look at the prison system, it&rsquo;s a much worse situation than we had seen before the rise of the modern-day civil rights movement,&rdquo; &hellip;</em></p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not one to accept blindly the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc</em> fallacy, but it&rsquo;s at least a good working hypothesis in this case, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>sbuffalonative@6:04: As for stepping up enforcement of discrimination, I want them to have a solid case&hellip;</p>
<p>This misses the point.  Laws against discrimination are an abomination.  In a free country, people should be free to decide what (legal) business they want to transact, and with whom, on whatever basis, for whatever reason they choose, or for no reason whatever.</p>

			<p>Move along, nothing to see here.  We are going to enforce the law as long as the enforcement conforms with our &#8220;civil rights&#8221; views.  If there is a conflict, of course, the most important of the two factors will win out.</p>

			<p>Sorry, TONY SOPRANO, you can bet the farm Holder will turn a blind eye to the Black-on-White crimes you pointed out. About the ONLY thing to expect from Holder will be MORE LENIENCY for Black perps. Maybe even making it a &#8216;criminal offense&rsquo; to describe your assailant, rapist or robber as being Black.</p>

			<p>Exit polling for this last election indicates that 95% of blacks voted for Obama. The same exit polls showed that 43% of whites voted for Obama.</p>
<p>Interesting that both Blacks and Whites are funneled through the government re-education camps (AKA Public Schools) resulting in Blacks becoming Afro-centric and militant with Whites becoming fragmented milk-toast.</p>

<p>Although blacks commit crimes diproportionately, over 80% of it is non violent. Such as drugs, gambling, public drunkness etc.</p>

			<p>One cannot legislate changes in human nature and the fact is that whites know that blacks will never adapt to white culture.  Holder will discover that over-playing the race card will result in the ethnic cleansing of blacks from our society.    </p>
<p>Whites no more accept Holder as a legitimate AG in our white nation than we accept Chairman Obama as a legitimate president.  </p>

God!   How true.   No, it&rsquo;s not just you.   I&rsquo;ve been noticing that too.  In my newspaper the other day, I noticed the same   &mdash;    all blacks!   Black faces everywhere.  It looks like the Harlem News!</p>
<p>It used to be just the sports pages (which they took over years ago).  And the crime reports too (minus photographs, in that case).   But more recently, it&rsquo;s the celebrity gossip, the entertainment, the advertisements, the social columns, political news and commentary &hellip;  and now <b>even the front page!   </b></p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s all about who&rsquo;s wedding whom, bedding whom,  dating whom, divorcing whom.  Who&rsquo;s fighting with whom. Who got arrested. Who got off.  Who got injured.  Black stars!  Black sports &#8220;heroes&#8221;!  Black celebs!  Black politicians!  I say, who cares???  I&rsquo;m not interested in their messy social lives. I doubt any whites are. Why have this stuff foisted on us &hellip;  all in the name of diversity?   Whites aren&rsquo;t interested.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s all written in the same oozing, gushy manner, from the basic viewpoint of, &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&#8221;   Never a breath of criticism is heard.  Jamal just won the fourth grade spelling bee in his school;  isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?    Urethia just gave birth to her second set of triplets:  isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?  LeShawuan won a basketball scholarship to the local A&M;  community college: isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?  Caprice and  Creola have opened an Afrocentric beauty parlour on MLK Blvd: isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?  Tyrone X was found innocent of rape, due to a technicality based on police bias. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?</p>
<p>And now    &mdash;   the President and Attorney General have stated that &hellip;blah, blah, blah. The First Lady&rsquo;s wardrobe (or hairdo, or poise, taste, charm, whatever) is being praised by &hellip;blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Enough!!!  Are we a black African  country already?  Whatever happened to white people?</p>

			<p>Thd reason for the racial disparity in prison time between those dealing cocaine and those dealing crack cocaine is that black leaders complained bitterly that crack cocaine use was causing great harm to their communities.  They demanded that the government do something to help.  In response, legislatures passed laws that gave longer prison sentences for those caught dealing crack.  The disparity was bought about by an attempt to help the blacks.  You cannot win.</p>

			<p>What does racial justice even mean? Whatever it means the practical consequence of racial justice, so called, is that black criminals are never jailed or are released from jail, which in turn means thousands of innocent whites and blacks mugged, raped and murdered, who would have escaped those fates had racial justice never been implemented.</p>

			<p>how many racial wrongs do we need righted? we have nothing but favorable legislation as it relates to blacks. what else do they want? some of our politicians ought to sit down with black leaders and make them make a list of the civil rights that whites own, that we are not allowing them to have. there would be none. also make them make a list of their final greviences listing everything they want so we can put this matter behind us. tell them we will honor the list and require them to make one, once and for all. after that case closed forever. i assure you they do not want the case closed, because they can continue their complaining from now on, and profit by it. also play hard ball with them by reminding them that no living black was ever a slave, and no living white person was ever a slave owner. we owe them nothing, and when we stand up and say that with force, then things will start to change. they are just like hyenas they steal and take by whatever means they can, and marching and demonstrating is effective. they have lost all touch with reality, a good example is rev wright, who drives 2 mercedes benz, lives in a 10 million dollar house and stands there condemning white america because somehow he has been wronged. it is absolutely laughable.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re still committing the majority of crime regardless of your claim that it&rsquo;s only &#8216;non-violent&rsquo;. If white people in my community were committing these crimes at black levels, they would be arrested for doing so because none of use would stand for it. The problem with black communities is that they, like you, want to turn criminals into victims. They&rsquo;re not victims. They&rsquo;re criminals.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play a what-if game. What if we no longer arrested black criminals for committing the non-violent crimes you stated. What impact do you believe that would have on your community? Would simply not arresting them make them better people or cause their disruptive and abusive anti-social activity to disappear? Would the quality of life in a black community rise or fall? By how much? How long would it take before that black community became unlivable? </p>
<p>The problem with black communities is not that there are too many black men in jail. The problem is that not enough black criminals are in jail and are free to destroy black communities with their non-violent and other qualiaty of life crimes. This is one reason white communities are better. We don&rsquo;t tolerate &#8216;non-violent&rsquo; crimes.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if you want to release all the non-violent black criminal from prison, I&rsquo;m fine with that so long as you keep them your communities where they&rsquo;re free to continue doing their non-violent crimes. Deal?</p>

Precisely.   As any police commander knows, black groups complain constantly about drugs and crime in the  &#8220;black community&#8221; and about inadequate or indifferent police protection.   Then, when more police are assigned, or the cops become more pro-active, they complain about being under surveillance and having too many car stops, too many frisks;  and when arrests increase, they complain that they are being unfairly targeted for arrest; and when they resist being arrested, they complain about police brutality.     <br>

<p>&hellip;the 1950&rsquo;s but it must have been heaven on earth &hellip; Anonymous 2:17</p>
<p>I lived in such a country in those times. In the 1950&rsquo;s, I was a child in the old South Africa, which was run by a White minority. In the town where I lived, blacks lived in a separate township, or in accommodation provided by their employers to domestic servants.  At 9:00 p.m. every evening, a siren would sound, and all blacks had to be off the streets in the white areas. The police patrolled, and arrested any blacks abroad who did not have a letter from their employer detailing where they were going and till what time.</p>
<p>Sounds draconian, doesn&rsquo;t it?  But it was our town, our culture, and we protected it.  I could walk anywhere in our town at any time of day or night, alone, in perfect safety.  And I did.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is heaven on earth. And although I may be unique, or at least rare, on this board in having experienced it, I&rsquo;m also rare in that I have actually lost my country. The rest of you are rapidly losing yours, and that scares me, because I am losing my world.  That&rsquo;s OK, I&rsquo;m old; but my children are losing theirs, and so are your children.</p>

How true!    Just the other day in the supermarket, I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing the faces on the boxes of cereal.   EVERY ONE paired a black face with a white face, all smiley inter-racial couples happily hugging each other,  obviously being either married or the best of friends.    Black male with white female. White female with black female. Etc.  No blacks with blacks, or whites with whites.  Only mixed. couples.   Just one specimen was missing:  NO WHITE MALES!   </p>
<p>This stuff is EVERYWHERE!   When you stop to notice, we are bombarded with it.</p>
<p>I did not, and will not, buy their brand of breakfast cereal.  They are plugging miscegenation, and I refuse to be propagandized in this way.   Let them go back to selling cereal, not race-mixing.    Same thing with the news and weather reports on TV.

<p>No, T Rexx, you are definitely not the only one. I feel the same way. I&rsquo;m sick of it too. Talking about it on this board is one thing, but white people need to take it to the next level. White people must stand up and say &#8220;ENOUGH&#8221;, or accept the consequences of sitting on their butts groveling to non-whites. Groveling doesn&rsquo;t work. White people (Europeans) made this country what it is, not exclusively, but mostly. Non-whites gravitate to America because they want what America offers; FREEDOM! They abuse the system because they lack the morality required to make a system work. Is it any surprise? That&rsquo;s what they left behind, but not really left behind, because they take it with them. I believe the only chance America has for survival is for white Americans to band together and stop tolerating the multicultural failure. I would like to see the leaders of AMREN do what it takes to make more Americans aware of what is going on in America.</p>

<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a lot of foolishness on this site lately. There seems to be a lot of pontificating by blacks and a few others about such things as &#8216;Cleopatra was black&rsquo; and &#8216;80% of black crime is non-violent&rsquo;  &mdash;  without a shred of evidence presented to back up any of these premises. </p>
<p>Here are a few facts about black crime from The Color of Crime, a well-researched, well-written, well-footnoted, well-documented book that makes use of FBI, DOJ and other reliable, verifiable sources.</p>
<p>I know of no rebuttal or refutation of the statistics quoted about black crime in The Color of Crime. </p>
<p>As Nicholas Stix writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Color of Crime&hellip;is the most scientifically rigorous research on crime and race available. It&rsquo;s the state of the art&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://nicholasstixuncensored.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nicholasstixuncensored.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;Blacks are just 13 percent of the population but they commit more than half the muggings and murders in the country&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call murder or muggings non-violent, would you?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A black is about 39 times more likely to do violence to a white than the other way around, and no less than 130 times more likely to rob a white&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you consider robbery non-violent?  Is attacking Whites non-violent?  Only the lame, biased media would report something so blatantly stupid  &mdash;  just as they refuse, more often than not, to identify the race of criminals (unless the criminal is White, then it is Front Page news, centered, above the fold, and replete with pictures).  Is it any wonder that main stream newspapers are hemorrhaging readers and many are on the verge of bankruptcy? Good Riddance.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Every year there are about 15,000 black-on-white rapes but fewer than 900 white-on-black rapes. There are more than 3,000 gang rapes of whites by blacks &mdash; but white-on-black gang rapes are so rare they do not even show up in the statistics&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about rape?  Is that also non-violent to you?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the good news for you: The Color of Crime is available for you to read right here and now, for free, no less. </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.colorofcrime.com/" rel="nofollow">https://archive.colorofcrime.com/</a></p>
<p>I suggest you read it and familiarize yourself with the statistics about the huge amount of violence blacks commit, especially as it pertains to violence committed against Whites, before you post here again.</p>

			<p><b>&ldquo;&hellip;Blacks are just 13 percent of the population but they commit more than half the muggings and murders in the country&hellip;&rdquo;   <br>
I wouldn&rsquo;t call murder or muggings non-violent, would you?</b></p>
<p>    &mdash;    It is truly a stunning  triumph of propaganda, and proof positive of the power of media, that such amazing, outrageous statistics could be covered up  so effectively and the public be convinced that the facts are actually the reverse. And furthermore, putting salt on the wound, that the victim group are really the guilty ones, while the aggressor group are always portrayed as victims deserving of endless sympathy, concessions and compensation.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;&hellip;A black is about 39 times more likely to do violence to a white than the other way around, and no less than 130 times more likely to rob a white&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>
Do you consider robbery non-violent? </b></p>
<p>    &mdash;    No, Bon.  Obviously not.   Robbery, by its very definition (at least in NY State) inherently inplies the use of force or the threat of it (such as a weapon).  Anything non-violent or weaponless (such as pickpocketing or purse shatch) is classified as larceny, not &#8220;robbery&#8221;.  The public may recognize no such fine distinction, but those who compile statistics do.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a great many actual robberies (to keep the bad crime stats down) are listed as larcenies. Just omit mention of the violence or the weapon.  So the real picture is worse than it appears. Police commanders don&rsquo;t get promoted and politicians don&rsquo;t look good when robbery stats are high. Politicians get re-elected when stats go down. Some politicians (such as Guiliani, or at least those who worked for him) were experts in &#8220;finessing&#8221; the statistics. Things are not always what they seem.</p>
<p><b>Only the lame, biased media would &hellip; refuse, more often than not, to identify the race of criminals (unless the criminal is White, then it is Front Page news, centered, above the fold, and replete with pictures). Is it any wonder that main stream newspapers are hemorrhaging readers and many are on the verge of bankruptcy?  Good Riddance. </b></p>
<p>    &mdash;    Maybe good. Maybe not.  The essential question is what will replace them?  If TV, it&rsquo;s not any better, probably even worse.</p>
