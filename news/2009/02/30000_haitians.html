<h1>30,000 Haitians Ordered to Leave U.S.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Haitian officials, however, say they&rsquo;re not issuing the travel documents needed to process most deportees.</p>
<p>Handfuls of deportees with valid passports have been returned to Haiti since Dec. 5, following a three-month break in deportations, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. But Haitian officials say the storm-batted Caribbean country needs time to recover and can&rsquo;t handle the return of its citizens.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the lack of travel documents means some deportees are spending more time in crowded detention centers. According to ICE, about 600 Haitians are being detained and more than 240 others are under a form of house arrest and being monitored with electronic ankle bracelets.</p>

			<p>Haiti is an anthill headed for disaster(even if it is already there). Less than 5 years ago, their population was 8 million, up from 2 million 40 years earlier than that, now it is closing in on 10 million.At that rate, what will it be 40 years from now? Do the math. No one wants to say what is causing Haiti to spiral downward into oblivion, but everyone knows why.As much as I hate to say it,the true villians in the sad saga of Haiti are the scoundrels who brought the ancestors of the present day Haitians to Haiti. If there ia a Hell, they surely belong there.   </p>

			<p>The simple solution to this &#8220;hold-up&#8221; is to withhold all U.S. aid money slated to be funneled to Haiti, until the Haitian authorities grant the go-ahead. Money always seems to talk better than mere words.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m sure if one digs deep enough into Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;stimulus plan&rsquo; one would find provisions for buying up foreclosed properties in white suburbs and relocating these &#8216;refugees&rsquo; there.</p>

			<p>Like many black nations who get rid of thousands of black criminals, they don&rsquo;t want them back, because they have more than they can handle, since blacks are more prone to commit crimes than any other race on earth, and their crimes rates are through the roof.</p>
<p>The US will just have to keep them, untill they catch them in a crime, then cloth, feed and care for them in prison.</p>
<p>The spending bill should have included the construction of about 10,000 more prisons, so we will have room to put more blacks and mestizos in the coming decade.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the black race was not intended by nature to be confined to an island, where there is not enough land to support their unrestrained population growth, especially when it is artificially supported by financial aid from foreign countries. </p>

			<p>Just load them onto freighters and beach the freighters on Haitian beaches with GPS autopilot. The nerve of these Blacks nations rejecting their own citizens. Hell, give the returnees Stenguns just to teach the Haitian government a lesson in insolence!</p>

<p>Good luck getting the rest of the 30,000 Hatians back home.  Even the law abiding, hardworking among them (there are some) will have more children than they can afford, rely upon welfare, and give birth to &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; with less capacity for intellect, and a greater disposition toward violence than the white population.  The truth is that Haiti will never be prepared to absorb any people - be they native Hatian or not.  They don&rsquo;t even have sufficient resources to support the people there now.  If they were able, they would be forcing more of their population upon us.  The only solution, under current United States law, is to keep the Hatians from arriving here in the first place.  </p>

chaff! </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too bad Haiti can&rsquo;t process their deportees, and it&rsquo;s too bad Iraq can&rsquo;t govern themselves, and it&rsquo;s too bad Mexico can&rsquo;t take care of it&rsquo;s own population. </p>
<p>The politicians talk about how proud Americans should be. Well, these politicians, past and present could start showing pride as Americans by protecting it&rsquo;s soil against invaders of this nature.<br>
The problem is HERE.. in the homeland, not in some God-forsaken land.It&rsquo;s right HERE!!</p>

While I don&rsquo;t approve of what they did, in fairness to them, they could not have foreseen the results of their actions.  Europe was then the center of the world - their world - and a Caribbean island was off on the edge of nowhere. It didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And if they hadn&rsquo;t brought in Africans, the island would look like Guatemala or Bolivia instead.</p>
<p>Our world as it exists today would have been unimaginable to anyone living in that era.  What are we doing right now that will be seen as disastrous in another three hundred years?</p>

			<p>I read once that Doctors without Borders set up a small clinic in a Haitian slum, and were soon overwhelmed delivering babies.</p>
<p>The CIA factbook states the average number of births per female is between four and five. Half the population of the island are children.</p>

<p>The U.S. should use force, if necessary, to make Haiti accept Haitians.</p>

			<p>the population is much too large for the island &amp; the living conditions have become hellish. they desperately need some sort of national plan to bring the island back to a manageable level. i strongly condemn charities who keep dumping food &amp; medicines on underdeveloped nations with no intention of addressing the fundamental problems. i sympathize with the haitians but they need to take care of their own problems and stop dumping them on us.</p>

			<p>Reply to GHW:</p>
<p> &#8220;The island would look like Guatamela or Bolivia&#8221;,,,</p>
<p> Actually NO. The Amerindians were virtually wiped out on the islands in short order by disease, etc. These islands could have been inhabited exclusively by Whites but the European aristocracy was more interested in plantation-style agriculture then expanding their national cultures. It was a short-sighted policy. Slavery in the U.S. south was also a short-sighted colossal blunder. Had I lived in that time, I would have been an abolitionist. Not because I think slavery was wrong (although I admit it was wrong) but because it was indirect black immigration.</p>

<p> When has Haiti EVER been &#8220;manageable&#8221; except when it was controlled by the French? When since the early 1800&rsquo;s has Haiti been &#8220;manageable&#8221;? What has Haiti accomplished in the past 205 years? </p>

			<p>Can some explain to me why Haiti is not a first world nation. Compare the geography Iceland or Greenland to Haiti or Jamacia. Which one do you think would be better for humans inhabit and make a successful society?</p>
<p>Notice how Haiti has been free for over 200yrs and yet it is not a first world nation. </p>

			<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t it occurred to the Haitian people that it&rsquo;s time to stop breeding in such large numbers?  Why don&rsquo;t they get it?  Their only recourse is to blame the United States for not helping them.</p>

Food and medical aid to Africa, probably.  Sending AIDS management drugs to Africa is insane - spending billions to keep contagious AIDS carriers alive (and healthy enough to breed) on a violent, starving continent with an exploding population problem??  Only Western whites would be that stupid&hellip;  </p>

<p>Which is probably why the Confederate constitution strictly prohibited the importation of blacks from anywhere other than the slave states of the USA, and gave Congress the option of removing that exception as well.</p>
<p>For those who still cling to the &#8220;comic book history&#8221; taught to them in school, slavery existed in all 13 colonies at the time of the Revolution. The northern states ended slavery for economic reasons (it makes no sense in an industrial economy). At the same time, they (wisely) enacted laws to keep as many blacks out as possible. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Soil_Party" rel="nofollow">Free Soil Party</a> advocated keeping slaves out of the territories. They knew slavery was slowly dying (as the Founders anticipated), so keeping slaves out meant keeping blacks out. Oregon&rsquo;s original constitution flatly prohibited blacks from living there.</p>
<p>By 1860 many Southerners had also concluded keeping slaves wasn&rsquo;t worth the cost. Robert E. Lee was one of them; had the South won the war he likely would have succeeded Jefferson Davis as president and accelerated the process. Slavery in the CSA would have ended by 1885 or so and the former slaves repatriated to Africa.</p>
