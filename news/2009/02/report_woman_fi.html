<h1>Woman Files Lawsuit Against Miley Cyrus for Offensive Gesture</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOXNews, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>TMZ reports that the Los Angeles woman, Lucie J. Kim, has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all Asian Pacific Islanders living in Los Angeles County. And she&rsquo;s seeking quite a payout: $4 billion.</p>
<p>In the controversial photo, Cyrus, 16, is shown sitting on her boyfriend Justin Gaston&rsquo;s lap surrounded by a group of friends all making a stereotypical gesture by pulling their eyes into a slanted position. The gesture is commonly thought to be offensive to Asian Pacific Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kim&rsquo;s lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses Cyrus of a civil rights violation and requests at least $4,000 in damages per potential plaintiff, according to TMZ, which says a representative for Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t be reached Wednesday for comment.</p>

			<p>I think that when someone brings so unwarranted a case to court, they can be compelled to pay the costs of the court and of the defendant.  I hope the judge has the integrity to extract every possible penny out of this plaintiff.  And afterwards, I&rsquo;d like to imagine that the INS would put her on the next plane back to Korea, as an ungrateful guest who is an enemy of Americans and our inalienable rights.</p>

			<p>If you look closely at the picture, the asian kid is clearly trying to open his eyes as wide as possible to affect a &#8216;caucasian&rsquo; look, while all his friends are affecting an asian look.  they are just having fun with each other.  Do you honestly think that all of the white kids could have mutually conspired before the picture was taken to ridicule this poor asian kid?  It looks like it was planned ahead of time  &mdash;  we&rsquo;ll look asian, you look caucasian.  typical teenage humor.  get over it.</p>

			<p>Ann Coulter&rsquo;s latest column leads off by pointing out the signs of the times, wherein illiterate jurors hand out awards for damages without even grasping the difference between a million and a billion (I believe she wrote that before this story broke), and simultaneously we see an entire Democrat party who fails to understand the implications of a trillion dollars&hellip;</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi goes in front of the cameras a couple of days ago and says that we are &#8220;losing 500 million jobs a month&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Menawhile, the case filed by the black D.C. judge against the Korean dry cleaning service owners for $54 million in damages over a pair of trousers remains in the courts on appeal&hellip;</p>
<p>A single woman with no income, no job, no brain, no sense, no moral compass, no shame, and apparently no sane adult influences in her life whatsoever  &mdash;  even among the vast medical staff certainly required to administer her various human growth projects  &mdash;  willfully cranks out another eight babies at once, on top of the six she already has&hellip; </p>
<p>Seriously, folks, something&rsquo;s gotta give.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>It is astounding to me, and probably all people who have real life experience in the courts by being sued, that so many, presumably intelligent, people have these quaint opinions about the doings of the court system.</p>
<p>The courts exist to strip money and property from those who have it and transfer its ownership to the lawyers, judges and court reporters who make it all legal. The plaintiff is necessary and will be accepted even if they are mentally deranged, on dope, alcoholic, retarded or suffering from old age dementia. </p>
<p>In other words: The judges and lawyers love these suits!!!<br>
The word corruption relates to the doings of court&hellip;</p>
<p><b><br>
Just another example of why we need a losers pay system when it comes to frivolous lawsuits. If this nitwit knew she might be on the hook for money after this nonsense is thrown out she might have never crawled out of her hole.<br>
</b></p>
<p>This nonsense will NEVER be thrown out as long as there is a defendant with money.</p>
<p>Only suits against lawyers, judges and court reporters for corruption get thrown out.</p>
<p>The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1820 *that to allow a wrongfully sued defendant recourse against the frivolous plaintiff would tend to deny a poor man his day in court and thus such was necessarily barred*.</p>
<p>So is it no wonder that the Koreans had to come up with $300 THOUSAND to defend their property from the $54 MILLION suit for a  misplaced pair of pants?</p>
<p>The court, which is the judge, court reporter, and some lawyers, wins every time.</p>
<p>Most of you people have no idea how quickly your life can be ruined.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is used much like a bullet in the head, it really kills the defendant by ruining his life.</p>
<p>It is called racketeering and it is the biggest business in America.  </p>

			<p>My female friend suggests that Miss Cyrus counter-sue every Asian in LA country that bleaches their hair blonde, or buys the Hannah Montana look, for attempting to destroy her brand.</p>
<p>Of course, Miss Cyrus is only 16 years of age. I have real doubts anyone can sue a minor for any gesture&hellip;.including those much more offensive. <br>

			<p>Too funny for words. Too ridiculous to be believed. Another racial minority wants to get rich quick. So what $4 billion work out to? I mean for the Orientals in Los Angeles county? About a million dollars apiece?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t Whites get the idea of suing MINORITY MEMBERS&hellip; like the Korean kid&rsquo;s family for emotional stress, caused his shooting up that Virginia Tech campus. Suing Black actors because ghetto punks get the idea robbing, stealing is cool. We could sue Latino actors because their Hollywood success inspires illegal immigration into our country, and then we taxpayers end up supporting some Hispanics once they get here.</p>

<p>Well, I must say that this Kim fool is rather limited in the scope of her endeavor. Why not sue for $4 million, trillion, billion, quadrillion dollars, on behalf of every Asian/Pacific Islander on the planet?</p>
<p>Perhaps, that should be Miss Cyrus&rsquo; counter attack? She should counter sue her for discrimination against all Asians outside of L.A. County. After all, isn&rsquo;t this what any good &#8220;citizen of the world&#8221; would have done?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>I sincerely hope that the judge who hears the opening arguments of this case is not some cretin such as the judge who presided over the McDonald&rsquo;s hot coffee case.  The scary thing is, as has been pointed out already, that a judge may find merit in this idiocy.  If Kim presses this suit and loses, then, depending on the laws that have jurisdiction here, I would be pleased to learn that Miss Cyrus is suing Kim for malicious prosecution of a civil case for some paltry sum such as $8 billion.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>

<p>Your points are well taken, VigilantAmerican. At that rate the entire USA and a whole lot more would be unemployed in less than a month.  Are these supposedly EDUCATED people?  After all, we are talking about the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  Oops, that&rsquo;s right, she is a democrat, so she just misspoke.</p>
<p>Just as a side note, I hasten to thank the judge and jury of the McDonalds hot coffee case, though, because now I have a warning in the directions on the back of my TV dinners that reminds me that upon removal from the oven my dinner may be hot.  This has to be one of the most striking revelations of the past 100 years.  My gratitude to the saviours of social justice is overwhelming.</p>

			<p>To the person who commented on people not understanding what a trillion dollars is I like to use this verifiable example. If you had a job that paid 1,000,000 ( one million ) dollars a day 365 days a year all it would take is 2700 years for you to have collected the full trillion.</p>

			<p>I hope Cyrus&rsquo; family is looking up the state involuntary committal laws, as Kim is clearly unstable.  Anyone who files a 4 billion dollar lawsuit over a teenager&rsquo;s clowning around with friends deserves public ridicule rather than compensation, but also deserves very close long-term supervision from mental health professionals.</p>
<p>If allowed to proceed, this lawsuit would provide a legal precedent for whites to sue Asian women who have their hair curled, for whites and Asians to sue black women who have their hair straightened, and for whites and blacks to sue Asians who have their eyefolds surgically altered.  </p>
<p>It also bears mention that there is no Constitutional Right to &#8220;not be offended&#8221;.  I offend liberals with my outspoken political views, which can be honestly described as somewhat to the right of Vlad Tepes (most of you would be suprised at the number of my posts here which are rejected by the editors).  I offend some other right-wingers by having married a Japanese gal (who&rsquo;s politics even I sometimes find disturbing).  If you&rsquo;re &#8220;offended&#8221;, GOOD.  GOOD if you&rsquo;re offended!  Grow up and get over it. <br>
