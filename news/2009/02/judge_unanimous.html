<h1>Judge Unanimously Charged, Suspended</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WFSB-TV (Hartford, Connecticut), February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Superior Court judge charged with drunken driving and using racial slurs while arguing with police officers has been suspended for 240 days by a judicial review panel.</p>
<p>Judge E. Curtissa Cofield was accused of making racially charged comments at the officer who arrested her.</p>
<p>After hearing evidence in the case, the panel planned to deliberate on whether Cofield violated judicial ethics. The panel determined, by unanimous vote, that Cofield&rsquo;s &#8220;disparaging and demeaning&#8221; comments failed to live up to the standards of integrity and impartiality expected of judges.</p>
<p>Cofield&rsquo;s comments to the officer following her arrest were captured on video. She claims that her derogatory and racially charged statements were the effect of her intoxication. She urged the board to give her 30 years of public service and good reviews more weight than the video.</p>
<p>The board unanimously convicted Cofield of all five judicial misconduct charges against her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an appearance before the board Monday, Cofield apologized to the police officers involved, her family, her fellow judges and the entire state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>That is an abomination. That penalty is NOTHING. If a private citizen pulled on a state trooper what she did, they&rsquo;d be in more trouble.</p>

			<p>it&rsquo;s about time the courts show a little True Justice. Nice Job and hats off to them. The convicted judge should be held to a hgher standard then just someone off the street, she was under the False Impression that just because she was black she could get away with anything&gt; The ruling was firm yet fair.</p>

			<p>This suspension sounds almost reasonable until you think of what would have happened to a white Judge who did the same thing.<br>
He would have been removed from the bench permanently and disbarred.<br>
His life and livelihood would have been destroyed by the black NAACP lynch mob, the Black Lawyer&rsquo;s Bar, and the state Congressional Black Caucus. </p>

			<p>where do they get 240 days from? If I was a &#8220;ghetto black&#8221; as she so rightly put it in the origional story on AMREN, I would have my conviction appealed if imposed by her.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Disparaging and demeaning comments&#8221;? I thought the offense was drunk driving.  Silly me - that&rsquo;s her <em>de</em>fense.</p>

			<p>Now that there is a Black president, Blacks think that they can live by their own rules. Wait, hasn&rsquo;t it always been this way?</p>

			<p>If this judge was white, especially a male who held any high stature position, 240 days would be a slap on the wrist. A White Male would have had to explain his comments then appologize then grovel then go to tolerance training and then be fired. Just ask Trent Lott, Don Imus, or John Rocker.</p>

			<p>To Nordic and Great White Observer,</p>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve said it, but you both beat me to it. </p>
<p>Had this pitiful oxygen-thief of a &#8220;judge&#8221; been white the uproar would&rsquo;ve still been going on. Not only that, but had she been white, every case she ever heard involving a black defendant would&rsquo;ve been reopened in some manner or another and examined for racial prejudice as grounds for appeal. </p>
<p>Blacks live a life of privelege, bestowed on them by the Double Standard. Amazing. </p>
