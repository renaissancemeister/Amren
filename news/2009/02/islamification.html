<h1>Islamification of Britain Continues: New Police Uniform Features Hijab</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, February 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Third World colonisation of Britain proceeds apace with the news that the official police uniform has now been adapted to allow for the wearing of the Muslim hijab.</p>
<p>The police hijab is plain black and apparently made of a flame-retardant material. Officers will be able to wear a standard police hat on top of it if they wish.</p>
<p>A number of forces around the country have already introduced the hijab, including Thames Valley and the Metropolitan police.</p>
<p>The police&rsquo;s annual report for 2007/08 showed women made up about 23 percent of the force&rsquo;s officers. The number of officers from black and Asian communities stood at about six percent  &mdash;  short of the official fifteen percent target. The intention of introducing the hijab is to encourage Muslim women to consider joining the police force.</p>
<p>It would be unthinkable for any Islamic nation to adapt its official uniforms to allow Christian or any other religious artefacts to be incorporated into its emblems.</p>
<p>This sort of thing only happens to a nation which is being occupied and colonised by foreigners. This is the very definition of colonisation: the forcing of an alien and foreign way of life upon another people.</p>
<p>A further example of this process was seen recently at the announcement that the world-famous William Gladstone Library in Hawarden, North Wales, is to open a Muslim Reading Room and library.</p>
<p>Readers will however be glad to hear that John Walker, BNP Hawarden Community Councillor, is actively on the case. &#8220;It is absolutely impossible to even consider a library in any Muslim state opening a Christian Reading Room and Library,&#8221; Mr Walker said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, it is actually illegal in many Muslim countries, including that religion&rsquo;s homeland, Saudi Arabia. The mere propagation of Christianity in those countries is a criminal act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Britain however, is being colonised by the Third World, and the Labour and Tories expect the British people to meekly accept it. Well, I have news for them: watch this space, and see what happens in Hawarden in the near future!&#8221; Mr Walker said.<br>

			<p>The British people have no one else to blame for this situation.</p>
<p>They have for years been accepting any old propaganda dished up to them.  Time to stand up &amp; take note of where they are headed before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Just stand up straight, pull your shoulders back, push your chest out and say I&rsquo;m proud to be white, British and not guilty<br>
of oppressing anyone.  Go on try it, you&rsquo;ll feel a lot better.</p>

			<p>Such insanity is taking place in Europe and in every White country to some extent at the moment.  Britain has to stand out as the country with the worst problems.  Britain is likely to go down first because they&rsquo;re so far along the multicultural road to destruction.  What is amazing is that they&rsquo;re self-destructing and a large segment of the White population are so overwhelmed with guilt if they have any racial feelings for their own kind.  The majority feel like they must go along with this.  This is a prelude to violence - racial violence of the worst kind, because when the point of critical mass is reached, these Muslims are going to believe that the country is theirs and they will try to destroy the rest of White culture not only in Britain, but in other European countries as well; events like this are occurring all over Europe.  Eventually it will arrive in the U.S. although the problems here will probably not involve Muslims so soon, but other groups like Hispanics and Blacks.  It will probably be here sooner than we think.</p>

			<p>If Whites ever riot, the hijab will be a target.  Can a Moslem remove their headgear in order to avoid premature martyrdom?</p>

			<p>The scope of change in England is beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>Someone please explain why the british people are allowing it and why the british politicians are encouraging it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I will ever understand why an entire race allows themselves to be subject to genocide.</p>

			<p>I had read that the &#8216;hijab&rsquo; cost the British police force over a hundred thousand pounds to design.  At the same time, two white British school girls are threatened with expulsion for their hair being too blonde.  I wonder if the government would be willing to design them special head coverings to protect their rights?</p>

			<p>  This is absoleutely devastating to read. The land of my ancestors has been over-run. This is a nightmare come true. The leaders in the labour and tory parties should be dragged into the streets and executed.</p>

The #1 Islamist enemy of the secular Turkish Republic holds court in a compound in Pennsylvania!</p>
<p>From  <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/2045" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/article/2045</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In 1998, Gülen departed for the United States, reportedly to receive medical treatment for diabetes. However, his absence also enabled Gülen to escape questioning on his indictment in 2000 for allegedly promoting insurrection in Turkey in a series of secretly-recorded sermons. </p>
<p>Since his voluntary exile, Gülen has resided on a large, rural estate in eastern Pennsylvania, together with about 100 followers, who guard him and tend to his needs. These servants are educated men who wear suits and ties and do not look like traditional Islamists in cloaks and turbans. They follow their hocaefendi&rsquo;s orders and even refrain from marrying until age fifty per his instructions. When they do marry, their spouses are expected to dress in the Islamic manner, as dictated by Gülen himself.</p>
<p>It is from his U.S. base that Gülen has built his fame and his transnational empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>What would Americans think if Osama bin Laden openly lived and ran his network from a mansion in Turkey? That&rsquo;s exactly what the US is allowing tobe done to her ally, Turkey. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why all this talk about fightig Islamists is so much bunk. The US, UK, Germany, France etc.. all have their favorite Islamist groups that they use to weaken other countries, much as the US uses Falun Gong against China.</p>

<p>Yes. They are going to go quietly, just like the Australians gave up their guns to the government, courtesy of their gun registration laws. This the reason why on virtually ALL US televison shows that mention a civilian owned gun they ALWAYS state either it is &#8220;registered&#8221; or the owner has a &#8220;permit.&#8221; It&rsquo;s to get the brainwashed public to accept this state of government fiat over your firearms. This is why the US government worked in secret to create a database of firearms from the data on the Form 4473s (they are sent to the BATF when a gun shop goes out of business) so that they will have a base to work with when the BHOs come to power. It&rsquo;s why the gun controllers work EXCEPTIONALLY hard through their news media puppets to close the so-called &#8220;Gun Show Loophole,&#8221; which is designed to ensure that your firearms will eventually acquire a paper trail for CONFISCATION.</p>
<p>So yeah, Britain is FINISHED. Hell, even The Econmist has an article in it about how the US doubts Britain is a miliatry power of any consequence, judging by their performance in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The biggest war against Islamism is being fought in Turkey. And the United States seems to be on the other site by protecting Fetullah Gulen, rather than deporting him back.</p>
<p>Other Islamists who fled Turkey are living in Europe today, collecting forcibly money from Turks living abroad to get more and more powerful. And of course, Gulen&hellip;</p>
