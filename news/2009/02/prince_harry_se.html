			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 12, 1009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prince Harry has been ordered to attend an equality and diversity course by Army chiefs after being formally disciplined for his &#8216;Paki&rsquo; remark.</p>
<p>It is the second time the prince will have had to undertake the racial awareness training, which is mandatory for recruits.</p>
<p>The course aims to educate soldiers on what type of behaviour and language is unacceptable in today&rsquo;s multicultural Army.</p>
<p>The decision for the prince to repeat the course was taken by his superiors after a review.</p>
<p>The incident, which happened in 2006 during a training exercise in Cyprus, has been written into his permanent Army record but is not expected to hinder his military career.</p>
<p>Prince Harry, who apologised for the remark said it was not meant maliciously.</p>
<p>A Clarence House spokesman said: &#8216;Prince Harry has been subject to normal Army disciplinary procedures. The matter is now closed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The news comes as he was embroiled in a new race row after a black comedian revealed he told him: &#8216;You don&rsquo;t sound like a black chap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The royal made the remark to Stephen K. Amos after he performed a stand up routine for the Prince of Wales&rsquo; 60th birthday celebrations.</p>
<p>Speaking on Channel Five&rsquo;s The Wright Stuff on Tuesday, Amos said it occurred as he joined a line-up of stars to meet the royals.</p>
<p>He explained: &#8216;Harry said, &#8220;Hello, tell me, amusing, but you don&rsquo;t sound like a black chap&#8221;.</p>
<p>Presenter Matthew Wright looked on stunned as Amos added: &#8216;I wanted to say, &#8220;How is I supposed to sound?&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asked if the remark had been made in jest, he replied: &#8216;I hope it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Co-host Lowri Turner declared: &#8216;That&rsquo;s not the point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The comedian, who has appeared on shows including the BBC&rsquo;s Have I Got News For You, later put the comment down to a poor attempt at making banter.</p>
<p>Charles&rsquo; birthday celebration was screened on ITV in November.</p>
<p>The comic appeared alongside comedy greats such as Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese and Robin Williams.</p>
<p>The equality course, which is expected to be more intensive than the first, was ordered as a response to the row which broke out when he called fellow Army cadet Ahmed Raza Khan his &#8216;little Paki friend&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But his fellow soldier jumped to his defence and insisted that he was not offended by the remark.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Prince called me by a nickname which is usually very insulting but I know he didn&rsquo;t mean it that way,&rsquo; he was quoted as telling The Sun.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were close friends when we were training and I know he is not a racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It later emerged that an Indian polo-playing friend of the Prince of Wales and his sons is known to them as &#8216;Sooty&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Prince Harry was also heavily criticised in 2005 after wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party.</p>
<p>Naomi Byron, national secretary of Youth Against Racism in Europe, told The Mirror: &#8216;Many young people will be disgusted by his remark  &mdash;  how is a black man meant to sound?</p>
<p>&#8216;But it is not just Prince Harry that is at fault. The aristocratic, rich circles he moves in obviously don&rsquo;t have a problem with this kind of racist stereotyping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Former Commission for Racial Equality chairman Lord Herman Ouseley said: &#8216;It is very sad that Prince Harry thinks black people all talk in the same way. It just goes to show how ill-educated members of the upper classes can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Clarence House refused to comment, saying &#8216;We do not comment on allegations about private conversations involving the Royals.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>I am not now nor ever have been a Micheal Landon fan. Never saw that Prairie show. But I did like his Highway to Heaven series. Where he was a traveling handyman sent by God and   opening others eyes in times of crisis. There was one show I remember that applies here. <br>
  It was the episode where a construction magnate had lost his mind and thought and lived his life as if he were King Arthur.<br>
He spent his millions and tied up his building team making a stone castle to further his illusions. Nice work if you can get it. The crisis came from the fact that his children were trying to take away his business and have him committed. He became disheartened at the thought of fighting his own flesh and blood in court to live life as he saw it. He was ready to surrender. Then Micheal Landon says, &#8220;All right your Highness. But if you will not fight, then you cannot  for long be King&hellip;&#8221;  Seems to be the template here. God, Your Highness! Fight against it all and your subjects will follow and  will be millions. But if you will now fight, you can not for long be King&hellip;</p>

Too bad this is not article on he has just assumed the thrown, and with several traditionalist generals behind him, declared the Parliament of England illegal under present circumstances and so forth. Now, that would be boss.</p>

<p>THAT caused a &#8220;race row???&#8221; You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding me. With all the things black comedians (and others) have said about whites, that is supposed to alarm us? Just goes to show us how loony Britain has become.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in high school, this black student,  everytime he saw me, derisively called me &#8220;The Great White Hope.&#8221; I think he was trying to get a rise out of me. I simply ignored it because I knew the school administration would laugh at me if I complained about it (the school was about half black and hispanic at the time). </p>
<p>These blacks really need to get a life.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s called racial awareness training and it teaches tolerance.</p>
<p>And we all know that tolerance is something we put up with that we can&rsquo;t stand.</p>
<p>I wonder if they can explain why putting up with someone or something a person can&rsquo;t stand is going to be part of an ideal society, since ideal societies are supposed to be ideal.</p>

			<p>Prince Harry is far too intelligent to be brainwashed by the Brit PC mob and he has also had countless letters of support in the UK Press.  It would be interesting to see how many PC idiots are serving their country in uniforma as Harry is.  Only a handful at a guess?</p>
<p>And the British National Party continues to gather increasing support even though the Anglican church has just voted to ban BNP members from it almost non-existent congregations now.</p>

			<p>Could this be the King who restores English greatness?</p>
<p>&#8220;Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,<br>
Assume the port of Mars and at his heels,         <br>
Leash&rsquo;d in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire<br>
Crouch for employment.&#8221; -Henry V</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think so.</p>

			<p>Prince Harry is the younger son of the Prince of Wales, so he wouldn&rsquo;t be ascending the throne unless, for some reason, he should succeed his elder brother Prince William.  Britain is beyond any saving as we in the USA also find ourselves.  There is no strength left in the monarchy of Britain.  Look at the Prince of Wales and his idea that the monarch&rsquo;s title should be &#8220;defender of faith&#8221; instead of &#8220;defender of THE faith.&#8221; That&rsquo;s not exactly the hallmark of a leader I would want. <br>
(Actually, there is some basis for the argument that this portion of the title was a joke in any case, since it was given by the Pope to Henry VIII for his writings against Luther.  Was it not the same Henry VIII who later broke completely with the Roman Church for the sake of Anne Boleyn?)  At any rate, the title certainly sounds good.  I suppose it could be argued that, since Henry VIII saw the Church of England as THE Church, he felt justified in continuing to use the title. </p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s supposed to save Britain from the idiots in Parliament? How are we conservatives supposed to launch our movement?  Who&rsquo;s going to arise from obscurity to lead America back to its post-WWII state?  </p>
<p>Speaking of Britain:  I know England is in sad shape.  Does anyone else, more well informed on international happenings, know how things look in Wales and Scotland from a race realist&rsquo;s point of view?  What about the situation in Northern Ireland and in Ireland?  It&rsquo;s getting to the point where there seems to be no safe haven for true old-fashioned conservatives anywhere in the world. </p>

			<p>There is a lot more to Prince Harry than meets the eye. I wouldn&rsquo;t be entirely surprised if his sympathies lie more with the BNP. </p>
<p>Either case, he is the King that the native Britons need, and I think that a King Harry on the throne, with the BNP at Westminster, can have a chance of reclaiming Britain for native Britons once more. </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how anti-racists think that if we don&rsquo;t agree with them they need to &#8220;educate&#8221; us?  I guess I must have been misinformed because I thought education was about learning to think for yourself.  I&rsquo;m glad that the chairman of the anti-racist organization let me know that education really means blindly believing whatever the high priesthood of tolerance and diversity tells us.  I will try to keep this in mind in the future next time I catch myself thinking for myself.</p>

			<p>The problem is that his dad, Charles [sic] has stated in the past that he wants to be a future leader of &#8216;FAITHS&rsquo;(Does Charlie know something that we don&rsquo;t know, children?)<br>
No really, it was only very recently and due to pressure that the royals have had  non-white members within its workforce. All servants, flunkeys, butlers and below stairs staff were &#8216;hideously&rsquo; white. Also, both the royal babies have never spent much time in the company of non-white, non public school, non-titled people. (Grandad Philip is renowned for his lack of diplomacy in the presence of brown and yellow people).<br>
If Harry and the rest of the royals did what they do best, i.e. hunt, fish, play polo and spend most of the time on holiday in expensive resorts with a retinue of security guards and servants, perhaps we could all get some peace. Nowadays, every time a member of the royals sets foot in the real world they wind up putting their foot in the brown stuff. In the UK&rsquo;s present sensitive state the royals are increasingly out of step within what is sure to become a Muslim country headed and led by a covert inner sanctum of white, very wealthy entrepreneurial lords and ladies. (We&rsquo;re halfway there already) </p>

<p>Does anyone else see the weird irony in ordering a member of royalty to attend a course in equality?  LOL </p>
<p>Bizarre!  If these hypocrites were truly so committed to equality, they wouldn&rsquo;t have queens and princes.</p>

			<p>Reply to Cairdeas:</p>
<p> In general the situation in &#8216;Celtic&rsquo; Britain is much better then in England. The Celts, the Welsh and the Scots, seem to have a stronger &#8216;ethnic sense of identity&rsquo; then the brainwashed and watered-down English. There are also far fewer numbers of non-Whites and they are more recent too. On the other hand Scotland is the stronghold of the loony, treasonous Labour party that started non-White immigration to Britain. In Ulster there are very few coloreds. Both communities, the Catholic nationalists, and the Ulster-unionists have a very stong identity and are very tribal. In Eire it is somewhat of a different story. Many Irish people are very naive and not racially aware and they harbor some rather fanciful and romantic ideas about immigration from their own history and emigre-communities. The forces at work in so much of the west in undermining its demography also exist in Ireland and are sadly making headway. Still for now Ireland has an level of homogenity White Americans can only dream of.</p>
