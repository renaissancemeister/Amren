<h1>Democrats Strike Different Tone on Katrina</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Evans, AP, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The economic stimulus signed by President Barack Obama will spread billions of dollars across the country to spruce up aging roads and bridges. But there&rsquo;s not a dime specifically dedicated to fixing leftover damage from Hurricane Katrina .</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no outrage about it.</p>
<p>Democrats who routinely criticized President George W. Bush for not sending more money to the Gulf Coast appear to be giving Obama the benefit of the doubt in his first major spending initiative. Even the Gulf&rsquo;s fiercest advocates say they&rsquo;re happy with the stimulus package, and their states have enough money for now to address their needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not saying there won&rsquo;t be a need in the future, but right now the focus is not on more money, it&rsquo;s on using what we have,&#8221; said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who has criticized Democrats and Republicans alike over Katrina funding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a significant change in tone from the Bush years, when any perceived slight of Katrina victims was met with charges that the Republican president who bungled the initial response to the disaster continued to callously ignore the Gulf&rsquo;s needs years later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal government has devoted more than $175 billion to the region since Katrina ripped through New Orleans in 2005, and billions remain unspent. It&rsquo;s unclear how much more money will be needed, but nearly everyone agrees the federal government should continue investing heavily in the region&rsquo;s levees and other infrastructure to prevent a repeat of Katrina&rsquo;s devastation.</p>
<p>Under the $787 billion stimulus bill, states will share more than $90 billion in infrastructure money. Gulf states such as Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama can use their funds for Katrina-related projects, but they&rsquo;ll get the same formula-based share that other states receive.</p>
<p>There was hardly a complaint as Obama and other Democratic leaders pieced together the package. Members of the all-Democratic Congressional Black Caucus, who have called Bush&rsquo;s Katrina funding a moral failure, said they were thrilled with the stimulus bill. Landrieu won several provisions that do not allocate new money but are aimed at cutting through red tape to free up existing funds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thompson and others say new funding wasn&rsquo;t necessary in the stimulus largely because billions of federal dollars remain bogged down in bureaucracy or tied up in planning. As a result, they said, Katrina funding doesn&rsquo;t fit with the quick-spending purpose of the stimulus bill, which is aimed at kick-starting the economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In part, the lack of criticism this year could reflect a stronger trust by fellow Democrats that Obama will follow through with his campaign pledge to rebuild levees and &#8220;keep the broken promises&#8221; to the Gulf.</p>

			<p>I have a theory.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer published a map that I like to call the &#8220;Red Delta Map&#8221; not long after the November elections.  It showed the counties that voted more Republican in 2008 compared to 2004, which weren&rsquo;t many.  But they were mostly concentrated in an &#8220;Appalachian&#8221; belt from West Virginia, through Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma.  Sailer&rsquo;s theory is Scots-Irish solidarity.</p>
<p>Also, southern Louisiana were part of these red delta counties.  That is because many of New Orleans&rsquo;s blacks have not yet returned from Houston or elsewhere.  Meaning they weren&rsquo;t in Louisiana to vote Obama.  Probably the Obama Admin. thinks they&rsquo;ll never return, and Louisiana is Republican forever.</p>

			<p>Another beautiful example of Democratic hypocrits in aciton. From the day Katrina happened to the last day Bush was in office, I constantly ran into articles, and news by the leftist media, on how Bush neglected the Katrina victims, New Orleans, etc.</p>

<p>If the billions we have flushed into N.O isn&rsquo;t enough then another dime won&rsquo;t make any difference.</p>

			<p>Maybe nothing for Katrina victims&hellip; but pelnty of moola for ACORN, whose fraudulent voter registration practices went a long way to get WonderBoy elected. A $1 Billion program for education on sexually transmitted diseases. $200 million to provide computers for community colleges&hellip; and the list goes on and on.</p>

			<p>Has anyone noticed that &#8220;not a dime&#8221; of the great stimulus package is going for a fence either? This is insanity in its highest form. The small part of the fence that has been built, has shown a downward turn in apprehensions. The Border Patrol has said &#8220;the fence works.&#8221; But, in its infinite wisdom, this administration like the past few can&rsquo;t build the fence, can&rsquo;t implement E-Verify, can&rsquo;t deport illegal aliens, can stop benefits to the border jumpers, can&rsquo;t stop the misapplication of the 14th amendment - just can&rsquo;t do anything. Change? Afraid not. It&rsquo;s illegal immigration business as usual with our elected officials. I want to know why we have Mexico as an important trading partner? It&rsquo;s as dangerous as the Middle East countries who harbor terrorists. It is no different with the beheadings, kidnapping and all sorts of horrible crimes. We&rsquo;re just unfortunate to share a common border.</p>

			<p>I believe that FEMA purposely made things worse just to provoke riots.  I firmly believe that the stage is being set for race riots, followed by martial law and the final blow to our Constitution.</p>
<p>Now that being said, depending on the government is a BAD idea.  Whatever happened to self-sufficiency?  </p>
<p>Then again, who am I kidding.  Look what happened after white flight, when blacks were left to themselves.</p>

			<p>Oh come on, it&rsquo;s been 3.5 years now; why isn&rsquo;t that city rebuilt? The ancient Romans using ancient technology would have had that placed drained, cleaned, and rebuilt by now! Shameful, yet not shocking.</p>

			<p>In a way, I&rsquo;m kinda glad that federal money is not going to rebuild New Orleans.</p>
<p>Its mayor, Ray Nagin, declared that &#8220;the Second Amendment does not apply to New Orleans&#8221;. He actually said this during New Orleans infamous gun confiscations.</p>
<p>Any mayor who says that the U.S. Constitution does not apply in his/her city does not deserve a penny. Let him deploy his citizens to things like clearing away garbage or building roads.</p>
