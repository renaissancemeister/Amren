			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Holden, Reuters, Feb. 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of British Islamists plotted to cause deaths on an &#8220;almost unprecedented scale&#8221; by blowing up transatlantic airliners using liquid explosives hidden in soft drink bottles, a London court heard Tuesday.</p>
<p>The eight men were almost ready to execute their plan to bring down seven aircraft simultaneously in mid-air as they flew from London to the United States and Canada when they were arrested, Woolwich Crown Court was told.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suspects, who deny conspiracy to murder, were arrested in August 2006, just over a year after four young British Islamists killed 52 commuters in suicide bomb attacks on London&rsquo;s transport system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The men intended to smuggle on board components for their improvised bombs hidden as soft drink bottles, batteries, and involving other innocuous items, the court was told.</p>
<p>They had targeted seven flights, operated by American Airlines, United Airlines and Air Canada, to Chicago, New York, Washington, Montreal, Toronto, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The planes were either 777s, 767s or 763s, capable of carrying between 241 and 285 passengers and crew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plot was directed from Pakistan while Abdullah Ahmed Ali was the ringleader in Britain, Wright said. Some of those on trial were foot soldiers, with the &#8220;cold-eyed certainty of the fanatic,&#8221; who would have carried out the suicide attacks.</p>
<p>Wright said the men were indifferent to the carnage they would have caused and the identities of their victims was an &#8220;irrelevance.&#8221; He said the plot was &#8220;all in the name of Islam.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Thank God these vile murderer&rsquo;s were stopped and innocent lives saved.</p>
<p>Great Britain, sadly, still needs to save itself for the rising tide of immigration and Islamization that stands poised to overwhelm the Country and British culture. </p>

			<p>One of the accused, Donald Douglas Stewart-Whyte, is an indigenous Englishman. I am not surprised; Islam offered him the chance of dealing with the destructive forces of Liberalism. He has a belief that considers him a man, beloved by a powerful God, who has a duty to fight his Islam approved enemies. Contrast this with Liberalism, which declares that White men are worthless unless they oppose the White men who resist Liberalism. </p>
<p>Henry the Eighth, William Pitt, and Winston Churchill, and the English men who fought in the Crusades thought they could be men and Christians. Would they condemn an Englishman who opposes Liberalism and what passes for Christianity in today&rsquo;s England?<br>

			<p>Eight men!   All &#8220;British&#8221; citizens!<br>
<i>&#8220;They sat in the dock, all dressed smartly and flanked by security guards. The trial is due to last up to six months.&#8221;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Only eight? That&rsquo;s all?  That&rsquo;s the whole problem?  </p>
<p>The British government still fails to see the bigger picture. This should be an indictment and trial of the WHOLE Islamic colony that has settled and taken root in Britain. The only solution is to get them ALL out.  All!</p>
<p>This case is far from being the first such incident   &mdash;   and it won&rsquo;t be the last. Do people never learn?  What does it take to make them finally see the light? Is their government&rsquo;s rigid commitment to Diversity so great, so fanatical, that they are willing to risk many more horrors in the future rather than pull this weed out by the root and eliminate it once and for all?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s drastic but it&rsquo;s necessary. Otherwise, these aliens will continue being nothing but trouble forever. Ultimately, they must either convert you or kill you. That is Islam.</p>
<p>In short, the Diversity fanatics among us are as committed and as dangerous as the Islamic fanatics.  They each have their own goals, but one benefits from the other.  They are the oddest of friends.<br>

			<p>How disgusting to view these photographs and read the leftist press describe them as &#8220;Brits.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came close to carrying out their murderous attacks, but the beat goes on in the mosques, calling for jihad against Briton, the country they hate, and white Brits, the people they despise.  All this is ignored, however, and the corrupt government instead spends millions trying Nick Griffith for telling the truth.</p>
<p>Is there anybody foolish enough to believe that the people responsible for bringing in such hateful rejects shouldn&rsquo;t be tried and convicted of crimes against native Brits, and then end up swinging from a public gallows for all to see? </p>
<p>The multicults responsible for encouraging these kinds of third world rabble use as an excuse for bringing them in that they need more tax and consumer units because their population isn&rsquo;t growing fast enough, yet they wind up spending more on crime costs and social benefits that could never be offset by the amount of stimulus they give the economy.  They&rsquo;re losers who cost much more than they produce, and their added population figures are creating a situation where water resources are getting more scarce every year, and where water is scarce so to is food, because it takes thousands of gallons of water to make just a few pounds of food, so the danger in immigration goes far beyond just blowing people up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being brought in to create diversity, because the evil manipulators behind the scene believe a nationalistic society might be so nationalistic it would create another example of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for them.</p>
<p>The resulting collapse and chaos from messing with the homogeneity of Western nations is going to cause them far more grief than anything they could ever dream of in their worst nightmares.</p>

			<p>Donald Douglas Stewart-Whyte, the native English member of the group, has an interesting story as to how he discovered Islam.  Hopefully increases  Muslim immigration won&rsquo;t encourage more young men to join terrorist cells in similar fashion.  I have a feeling this type of encounter will become all the more common.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia: </p>
<p>A former girlfriend, Faith Hall, told the Daily Mirror that Waheed [Whyte] had first become friends with some Muslim youths two years ago, after being assaulted by some Asian teenagers. He tracked one of them down to ask why they had attacked him, and they became friends.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Winston Churchill wouldn&rsquo;t recognize them&#8221;,,,</p>
<p>Churchill was SO enthusiastic about fighting two brutal wars with Germany, an ethnically kin country. These wars consumed about eleven years of his life. And for what? Look what became of Britain after the wars. Some &#8220;victory&#8221;! Too bad someone couldn&rsquo;t travel back in time to show this story to those stupid Tommies going over the top on July 1 1916. &#8216;Go ahead and kill a bunch of White, Christian, Germans, mates, this is the country your grandchildren and great-grandchildren are going to be living in&rsquo;.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;.for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war. Like blackmail, it lays the basis for new and successively greater demands until, as in blackmail, violence becomes the only alternative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not my words, ladies and gentlemen, but those of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964) in his 1951 address to a Joint Session of Congress after his dismissal as Supreme Commander of Allied Powers by President Truman.  Do we ever learn?  It doesn&rsquo;t seem that we do. May God have mercy upon us.</p>

It&rsquo;s hard not to stereotype these guys based on the fact that they all look so similar.</p>
<p>Are we too paranoid, or not paranoid enough?</p>
<p>And &#8216;Question Diversity&rsquo; you asked recently on a older thread, if there was any connection between our recent bushfires and Islamic Terrorists. At this point all the suspects detained for the original 02/07/09 fires were imbalanced locals. And re the copycat fires lit since, investigations are still pending. But it looks like someone out there will be taking notes.</p>

			<p>What a surprise! Britons on trial over &#8220;airliner bomb plot&#8221;!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that usually peaceful and law abiding Britons now turned to bombing airplanes. They haven&rsquo;t done these kinds of things in the past. How could they change so quickly and resort to such barbaric practices that are incompatible with Western civilization? </p>
<p>Imagine how goofy all those morons, who advocated profiling at the airports, must feel after this happened. They would unfairly discriminate against individuals from Arab countries while bunch of Britons would sneak in under their noses and do the killing of the innocent. </p>
<p>Thanks God we didn&rsquo;t let that happen in our country!</p>

			<p>This whole affair could soon become very messy indeed. Most, if not all, of these &#8216;accused&rsquo; reside in High Wycombe and attended the Green Lane mosque there. Now read the AMREN story Feb 13th 2009 &#8216;Axe Falls on St. George&rsquo; and, in particular, the second part &#8216;Rolling Road Blocks&hellip;&rsquo; and ask yourself if this planned islam-fest should go ahead through the streets of High Wycombe, and, if if it does, what would be the reaction of the local populace to the police protected hoards of islamists.</p>

<p>Anonymous poster, you could not have hit a more dismal note, and one so very true. The tragedy of the Great War becomes more acute with every passing year. All of those White lives lost for what? They haven&rsquo;t preserved their nations, in fact they are all now lost. Their sovereignty, eclipsed by the EU and UN. Those millions, dead so that aliens could invade their homelands in peace and lay waste to all that those men held dear. In my eyes, those heros have been killed twice. </p>
<p>The two 20th century wars were terrible fratricides.  Why did we colonize Africa and refuse to destroy the native population, all the while we were murdering each other at the Somme and Ypres? The Christian Charity we displayed towards those not our kin, we refused to show our brothers. Hitler killed Jews when he should have been killing those who really threatened our Civilization, not those who helped us build it. </p>
<p>All that suffering, all the loss. I think of the English families who sacrificed sons, husbands, brothers and mates for a multicultural hell-hole that was rammed down their throats. That &#8220;green and pleasant land&#8221; which the Tommies believed they fought for, and for which Churchill labored was stolen away from those who gave their lives for it. All things considered, the boys should have stayed home, married their girls, had lots of kids, and grown old. </p>

<p><br>
Well said.<br>
We are cornered into choosing between two ugly options<br>
1] liberalism supported by both leftists and big capitalists.<br>
2] Alien Islam</p>
<p>   We must create a third healthier option and that is returning to our European traditional culture. Throw away all those Micheal Jackson CDs and get Scottish highland tunes or Tchaikovsky instead. We must bring back the mannerisms, tastes, morals and customs of our Victorian forebears such as traditional gender roles, respect for elders etc&hellip; That is the only sane option left for our people. Let us have the courage to say that by moving away from the ways of our forebears we made a big mistake.</p>
