<h1>Immigration Is Big Topic As 5th Cong. Dist. Candidates Turn Out</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craig Dellimore, WBBM-AM (Chicago), February 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s just a week to go before the primary election to pick the Republican and Democrat candidates for the Congressional seat vacated by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.</p>
<p>Most of the crowded field turned out for a candidates forum on the Northwest Side last night.</p>
<p>Immigration was a major topic of the forum at Northeastern Illinois University, with Democratic candidates  &mdash;  like State Rep. John Fritchey  &mdash;  all saying they favor some path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fellow state lawmaker Sara Feigenholtz says what&rsquo;s needed is courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s time in Washington that Democrats and Republicans work together and stop treating this like it&rsquo;s the third rail of politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alderman Patrick O&rsquo;Connor sought to use his City Council experience to distinguish himself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>County Commissioner Mike Quigley took a similar path.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are about a dozen Democrats in the 5th District race.</p>
<p>Frank Annunzio led off the discussion on immigration reform calling for a path to citizenship. &#8220;I believe that the roughly 12 million undocumented immigrants should be fast-tracked to citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Breyer agrees:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jan Donnatelli displayed her knowledge of the district:</p>
<p>&#8220;As much as 48.5 percent of our district speaks a language other than English at home so this question is absolutely critical to this district.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Geoghegan focused on education for immigrants:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the Republicans running for the seat formerly held by Rahm Emanuel said they, too, favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, in varying degrees.</p>
<p>Tom Hanson drew a line, saying he&rsquo;s not for amnesty, but does favor Sen. John McCain&rsquo;s proposals for a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greg Bedell wants to slow immigration to this country, by helping other nations so immigrants will be less driven to come here.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniel Kay wants to streamline immigration office operations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, Republican Jon Stewart  does favor amnesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? We need to take their money, tax it, put it into the government rolls so we can have them help pay for the health care and the education that we are giving them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On immigration, Matt Reichels [Green Party candidate] took the bold approach, saying he&rsquo;s for blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mark Fredrickson [Green Party candidate] was less specific.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point we have to define a law and decide to enforce it and I offer that for your consideration as we try to figure out what that law should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deb Gordils [Green Party candidate] gave her answer in Spanish for the diverse audience.</p>
<p>Simon Rebeiro says he, too, support&rsquo;s amnesty.</p>

<p>Great idea, stupid:  Let&rsquo;s tax people who usually make so little in income that they&rsquo;re not liable for Federal income taxes.  We hear this sorry argument from neo/lamers on the &#8220;right&#8221; who wants more non-white immigrants to pay for old American baby boomers in the coming decade   &mdash;   like their stoop labor is going to generate the tax base to do that.  What it will generate is the political will so that a Hispanic/lib Federal government in the middle of this century will cut old &#8220;gringoes&#8221; off of Social Security and Medicare.  I can ill imagine that cherry pickers will want to pay for old gringoes instead of their younger sisters&rsquo; needs.</p>

			<p>The 5th Congressional District of Illinois is up in Cook County. There&rsquo;s no reason to be surprised&hellip;it&rsquo;s Liberal Land up there. Any Republican that dares run in that district better have left-wing views or they&rsquo;ll have no chance in Hades getting elected</p>

			<p>Anonymous&hellip;.you will never find Rosana&rsquo;s quotes anywhere. You see our media is so liberal, they will never print what is the truth.  They sweep it under that rug  and as I see it now, Obama wants to shut up those who do not agree with him and his stupid ideals.  Sound familiar??? It should as Hitler, Stalin, and those who are in power in many other silenced countries rule and have ruled,  with an iron fist. Now it has come to our country, and it will take a long time to get those idoits out of power as they have the money to back them all up. Hollywood dances to their tune as well, as it stands to reason, birds of the feather flock together.  In the end, God willing, truth will prevail, we can only pray!</p>
