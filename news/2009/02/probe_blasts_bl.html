<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7873006.stm">Probe Blasts Black Police Group</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, February 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission has severely criticised the National Black Police Association for &#8220;shockingly poor&#8221; book keeping.</p>
<p>The IPCC said holes in accounting records made it impossible to account for &#8220;significant&#8221; sums of money.</p>
<p>However, its report said that problems were more likely due to &#8220;administrative failure than dishonesty&#8221;.</p>
<p>The NBPA welcomed the report and said that it now had &#8220;robust&#8221; systems in place for handling financial matters.</p>
<p>IPCC Commissioner Naseem Malik was also critical of some members of the association for a &#8220;lack of cooperation&#8221; in her investigation which she said had delayed her work.</p>
<p>Ms Malik found that NBPA staff had incurred &#8220;personal expenditure&#8221; against the charity&rsquo;s funds and off-set money they needed to repay against future expenses.</p>
<p>Examples included spending by a member on holiday in Zimbabwe and payment for personal calls on NBPA mobile phones.</p>
<p>Of &#8220;particular&#8221; concern were 330 transactions totalling £115,000 involving cheques from the NBPA and its bank debit card.</p>
<p>In a statement, the NBPA said it was satisfied that &#8220;all parties subject&#8221; to the investigation &#8220;had now been exonerated&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ms Malik&rsquo;s investigation followed a probe into allegations against police and staff working for the NBPA between 2003 and 2005.<br>

			<p>More likely &#8220;administrative failure than dishonesty.&#8221;  What that means are that blacks are incompetent bookkeepers, rather than crooks.  The second part I don&rsquo;t believe, the first part I do   &mdash;   I think it&rsquo;s a combination of both.  Usually, incompetent accounting practices and bookkeeping only occur because of some level of dishonesty and pilferage.</p>
<p>Is/Was Trevor Phillips the head of this group?  He was in St. Louis one time last year.</p>

			<p>Bar conversation with British expat who spent a career as a roving financial officer.  He said that he was in high demand in Africa and the Caribbean, although there were plenty of qualified native book keepers in those locations. But that the incidents of fraud and diversion of funds among those natives was well recognized by the commercial and political leaders.  Thus they sought out the ex-pats.  He went on to quote an African leader, who when confronted with the imblance of ex-pats vs. native accounts working the governement accounting jobs, replied that while the numbers of native accounts was accurate, near 80% of those native accounts were in jail for fraud on the job. The ex-pat went on to tell stories of when offending native accountants were caught, when questioned their office mates seemed oblivious to the crime and showed no concern for the ethical breach.  They were very open to learn how it was done and how to avoid getting caught.</p>

			<p>Please go look at this video taken from www.zasucks.com as posted by South African whites. And relevant to the article here, who is surprised by this conduct described in the article?<br>

			<p>The NBPA is simply a collection of those not White, Christian and English. They are rabid racists and will get away with this because the IPCC (naseem malik) will her shake her head sadly and say &#8220;well, what can we expect when we have to account to these whites for every single penny&#8221;. She may even push for compensation for this &#8216;charity&rsquo; which excludes White Police from membership. </p>
