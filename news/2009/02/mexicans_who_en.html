<p> Diario Xalapa  (Xalapa, Veracruz) 2/9/09 (also in others of same, large national paper chain)</p>
<p>&#8220;Migration of illiterates increases 20%&#8221;</p>
<p>A study by the National Institute of Educational Evaluation (&#8220;INEE&#8221;) (of Mexico) reveals that the number of illiterate youths  &mdash;  from 15 to 29 years of age  &mdash;  who emigrate to the United States in search of better living opportunities increased by 20 percent.</p>
<p>It shows that this portion of the population  &mdash;  which did not finish basic education  &mdash;  went from 40 percent in 2004 to 60.2 percent in 2007. (Sic) According to its reports they come mainly from Chiapas, Durango, Veracruz, Michoac√°n, Oaxaca and Guerrero, states which have the highest level of poverty and marginalization as well as indigenous population.</p>
<p>The study &#8220;Educational Panorama of Mexico, 2008&#8221; edited by INEE, points out the differences in migratory displacement of youths without basic education.</p>
<p>The most critical situation is in the state of Chiapas, where 81% of emigrant youths did not complete their basic education; it is followed by Durango with 79%, Guerrero with 72%.</p>
<p>In contrast, more than half of the 32.7 percent of youths who had completed their basic education came from Coahuila, Mexico, Sonora and Morelos. Further, 7.1% of those who had reached a middle or higher scholastic level came from three states: Sinaloa, Sonora and the Distrito Federal.</p>
<p>For INEE, these national level percentages demonstrate the possible educational de-capitalization of Mexico, because of the search for better income.</p>
<p>According to a &#8220;Poll about Migration in the Northern Border of Mexico,&#8221; the migratory crossings of Mexican youths from 15 to 29 years who have been in some U.S. border locality, (the respondents) stated that they would cross to work, to seek work or to reunite with family, and that they lacked immigration documents. It (the study) holds that the National Educational System has the task of elaborating strategies to reduce its vulnerability by increasing its schooling, at least reaching its basic level, so that they may face the U.S. labor market demands with better educational backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to specialists in the matter, youths drop out of school between 15 and 29 years of age and become part of the labor market. In the case of Mexico, part of this population opts for migrating to the United States of America in search of better work opportunities because of the low employment capability at the national level.</p>
<p>The specialists agree that some youths lean towards migration as an alternative to social mobility, which induces backwardness or abandonment of schooling.</p>
<p>The majority of the emigrants head toward the United States of America.</p>
<p>In 2007, it points out, the total of Mexican displacements heading to the United States to work, to look for work or to reunite themselves with relatives, and who lacked immigration documents, according to the &#8220;Poll about Migration in the Northern Border of Mexico&#8221;, was 896 thousand 709 crossings a year, of which 55 percent, that is, 429 thousand 970 migratory displacements, were by youths between 15 and 29 years of age.</p>
<p>In general, it underlines, the average of school years completed by the migrant youths is 7.7 (average between 2000, 2005 and 2007), lower than the years needed to complete a basic education, which shows that, in general, the migration of undocumented Mexicans to the United States is one of low educational qualifications.<br>

			<p>Yet, they keep telling us that we need these kind of people here to do the kinds of jobs we won&rsquo;t do, we can&rsquo;t be economically competitive without those who barely completed elementary school.</p>

			<p>It was stated on a t.v. program recently that a year of Mexican education was only equal to about half that time in the US, so they&rsquo;re only getting about the equivalence of a third grade education by US standards.</p>
<p>That seems more accurate to me, because I&rsquo;ve lived in areas with heavy HIspanic populations, and third grade average achievement seems about average.</p>
<p>In the interior of Mexico, in some villages and rural areas, many of them can&rsquo;t read or write.</p>

			<p>When I lived in Hollister, California, BRIEFLY 2005, the school board was looking for $300,000 that year so as to buy schoolbooks in spanish, so the parents could tutor their children.  That was the biggest joke and I already knew that the parents probably couldn&rsquo;t read spanish either!  Yet another waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money, and the taxpayers were like lambs to  slaughter, but aren&rsquo;t we all today with our rotten government?</p>

			<p>So Mexicans are mowing lawns and shoveling cow manure because they lack a education. I thought it was because racist White people would not hire them as surgeons, lawyers or teachers because Whites are racist.</p>

			<p>Is anyone surprised? The unwashed masses that our open-border liberal and &#8220;conservative&#8221; officials in Congress allow into our Country are uneducated, unrepentant, and totally unwilling to adopt American culture or values. Until we begin to elect 3rd Party candidates in large numbers, our borders will remain porous and it is illegals such as these who will slowly but surely take over the Nation. </p>

			<p>I can vouch for this article.  When I was a Controller/CFO for a medium sized company from 1995 to 2001 we hired legal Mexicans.  About 1/2 the Mexicans had a 7th grade education.  People that poorly educated cannot add much to a country&rsquo;s gene pool.</p>

			<p>Is it true that in some places in Florida one must PRESS 2 for ENGLISH!! I go down there a lot but I never call anyone. I&rsquo;m still wondering how much the drug cartels pay and what benefits they offer to a combat veteran??:)</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m personally shocked that the numbers are that high, in the areas I have experience with, most have less than 7th grade, usually its none at all.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Average Mexican illegal didn&rsquo;t make it through seventh grade.</p>
<p>No problemo, amigo! The Anglos, they are feelthy rich. They will be only too happy to send you back to school. To support you and your family with nice welfare checks and food stamps. With FREE health care for you and the ninos&hellip; while you finish school. They will be only too happy to make your your kids get a FREE college education because they&rsquo;re Mexicano&hellip; while Americans have to sweat and struggle to pay for their own kids&rsquo; higher education. Welcome to America. Where the Democrats and liberals can&rsquo;t do enough for illegal immigrants! (But then the money to buy the Latino votes simply comes from the taxpayers&hellip; not from their own pocketbooks.)</p>

			<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to be able to help their children with their homework either.  It takes at least 3 to 4 generations on average for Mexican to finally mainstream.  </p>

<p>The problem is, they aren&rsquo;t mainstreaming.</p>
<p>According to Hispanics:  A Statistical Portrait: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.even Hispanics who have been in the United States for more than three generations (third generation+) are twice as likely as whites and slightly more likely than blacks to report not having a high school diploma&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>This, despite the fact that the schools, especially in California, have turned themselves inside and out catering to and coddling hispanics  &mdash;  at the expense of White children.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Despite considerable efforts, the achievement gaps have grown wider since the 1990s&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Could it have anything to do with their average double digit IQs?</p>

			<p>The US Supreme Court ruled on 1982 by one vote that  states must provide free public education to all its residents, and that illegal aliens are included as residents. Any hope that this disaster that has wrecked many schools will be reveresed died with the election of Obama. He will appoint judges who will allow aliens to attend public schools and probably get instate tuition subsidies to public colleges.  These illegal morons get ESOL special classes, preferences on standardized testing, and high school diplomas that these taco-brains can&rsquo;t even read.</p>
<p>America will have a GDP the size of Zimbabwe once the minority-majority takes over business, finance and universities. This they will do when Obama rams sweeping affirmative action and immigration legislation through the leftist Congress.  </p>
<p>Secession anyone?</p>
