			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Porter, Telegraph (London), February 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey shows that it is the top concern that people want an incoming Conservative government to deal with.</p>
<p>Fifty-two per cent said they wanted a Tory administration to reduce immigration.</p>
<p>This week immigration figures revealed that one in nine people living in Britain was born overseas, highlighting a significant change in population make-up under Labour.</p>
<p>There were 6.5 million people born abroad who were resident in the UK in June 2008. This represented a rise of 290,000 on the previous year and 1.2 million since 2004.</p>
<p>The issue of foreign workers sparked strike action across the country when a refinery in Lincolnshire employed Italian workers to complete a contract, instead of using UK workers. Unions accused Gordon Brown of going back on his commitment to ensure there were &#8220;British jobs for British workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue caused consternation among many Labour MPs who watched their traditional supporters protesting so strongly against the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Labour ministers are aware that immigration is now a problem for them among their core voters. Hazel Blears, the Communities Secretary, recently said that the &#8220;white working class&#8221; feels ignored over the issue.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s poll it also comes top of the list of concerns among Labour voters with 42 per cent saying it should be cut compared to 62 per cent of Conservative backers.</p>
<p>Reducing the power soft the European Union is second and providing more to help families is third.</p>
<p>The poll also shows a comfortable lead for the Tories over Labour. The Conservatives are on 41 per cent, down two on last month, and Labour on 31, down one point on January&rsquo;s survey. The Liberal Democrats polled 15 per cent, down one.</p>
<p>That result would only, however, give Mr Cameron a Commons majority of 38. He and his party strategists are determined to land a sizable majority and capitalise on the Government&rsquo;s unpopularity.</p>
<p>When asked who would make the better Prime Minister, 25 per cent said Mr Brown, down two, and 33 per cent Mr Cameron, also down two.</p>
<p>There is more bad news for the Prime Minister with the finding that only 14 per cent believe the Government&rsquo;s measures to tackle the recession are working. Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, admitted this month that Labour needed to hold its nerve because the effect of its recession measures were not yet being felt.</p>
<p>The arrival of Ken Clarke as Lord Mandelson&rsquo;s opposite number has had an immediate impact. When asked who would make a better Business Secretary, 48 per cent said Mr Clarke and only 17 per cent favoured Lord Mandelson, who like Mr Clarke was brought back to bolster his party&rsquo;s front bench team.</p>
<p>One recent poll put the Conservatives 20 points ahead.</p>
<p>Mr Brown&rsquo;s own popularity also continues to decline. Sixty-five per cent of voters are dissatisfied with him as Prime Minister, up two from last month, and only 25 per cent are satisfied, down two.</p>
<p>When asked whether Mr Cameron was proving a good leader of the Conservative party 46 per cent said yes, the same as last month.</p>
<p>The Tories have also emerged as the party more trusted to get the country out of the present crisis  &mdash;  reversing the position of last autumn. Then Mr Brown&rsquo;s assured handling of the crisis saw an increase in his personal standing and an improvement in Labour&rsquo;s poll ratings.</p>
<p>But now 35 per cent say the Tories are more trusted to deal with the crisis and only 28 per cent Labour.<br>

			<p>Why are they so sure that the Tories are going to be able to flip Parliament seats, when there is the BNP?  Everyone&rsquo;s assuming that a vote for the BNP is not vote for Labor, but with Tory PMs like Major and Thatcher who were essentially open borders won&rsquo;t endear people who are worried about the immigration issue to the Tory Party.  Unless David Cameron is something special, which I don&rsquo;t see.</p>

			<p>The Conservative Party (aka Tories) under David Cameron are no longer &#8220;conservative&#8221;. They&rsquo;re just a little less extreme left than the communist (Za)Nu Labour gang who are currently in power.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the Tories will talk tough about immigration and the EUSSR come election time, but once in power, will do nothing, just like they always have in the past. In fact it was a Tory government (Ted Heath&rsquo;s) that took us into the EUSSR, telling us that it was just a trading partnership, when *they* knew all along, that it was going to be a United States of Europe.</p>
<p>Labour and Conservative (like Democrats and Republicans in the U.S.A) are just two sides of the same New World Order coin.</p>
<p>Only significant gains by the British National Party (BNP) can stop and reverse the rot, and if this doesn&rsquo;t happen, the once-Great British will lose their nation, becoming nothing more than &#8220;regions&#8221; within the totalitarian EUSSR, all the while being ethnically cleansed out of existence (as is well underway already).</p>

			<p>Unfortunately Britons are being deceived into thinking that a Conservative government would make any changes. <br>
Like NuLabour, the Conservative front bench is mainly comprised of career politicians with no first-hand experience of how most people live in present-day Britain. The Conservative leader, David Cameron comes from a very cosy, public school background - you can see it in his eyes when he is talking to people, a sort of detached, benign amusement. (Observe Prince Charles, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. Also, Tony Blair is a good example of this). <br>
The fact is that British politics is a form of &#8216;pass the parcel&rsquo; - decade to decade the status quo is maintained. The rich get richer, etc. Tony Blair is a good example of this.<br>
(Read Will Hutton&rsquo;s book &#8216;The State We&rsquo;re In&rsquo; from 1996. You&rsquo;ll find that the Conservative government of the time were sowing the seeds of disaster long before Tony Blair&rsquo;s NuLabour came to power).<br>
Also, mass immigration and its effects are not things that can be stopped like shutting down a factory.  The genie is now out of the bottle and, even if our borders were shut tonight, the birthrate of foreign immigrants would ensure Britain&rsquo;s continued changing demographics.<br>
The change would be slower but still inevitable.</p>
<p>No, we need a party comprised of conviction politicians with their feet in the real world.  This party is most certainly not the Conservative party as it is in 2009.  If the truth be known many, if not most Britons are now wishing to see an overtly rightwing government take over the reins of an increasingly and over-liberal country frightened of its own shadow, history and actions. Also, many of our present politicians are from the legal profession with experience of defending the indefensible - Tony Blair is a good example of the thinking of such people.<br>
Lawyers are not what we need - the legal mind has a tendency to go tip-toeing around in circles, the main objective being to win and to personally make as much money as possible from the victory.<br>
Tony Blair and his wife are a good example.</p>
<p>So, what are we left with, and where to go?<br>
BNP, or alternatively a drastically resigned NuConservative party with a Churchillite leader at the helm with softer policies than the BNP.<br>
Personally, I do not think that the BNP have a cat-in-hell&rsquo;s chance of ever leading the country.  It carries too much baggage and its leaders, apart from Nick Griffin, are woefully inarticulate within a hostile and liberal-biased media environment.<br>
Incongruously, a Conservative Michael Howard/Ken Clarke/William Hague alliance appears to be the only thing that we have left. <br>
Sad&hellip;.but worth thinking about.    </p>

<p>These two statements seem to be contradictory.  If most Britons want a right-wing government then why doesn&rsquo;t the BNP have a chance?  The BNP is gaining with every election and recently won a by-election in a &#8220;safe&#8221; Labour district with 41% of the vote.  <br>
The Tories will undoubtedly act tough on immigration in order to get into power, but their time is over if they don&rsquo;t follow through.  Even with the Tories&rsquo; lies, the BNP will make breakthroughs and BNP elected officials will force the Tories to either keep their word or look like liars if they don&rsquo;t.  <br>
Just a reminder: Americans can join the BNP.  It is fairly expensive - about $80 U.S. dollars a year - but is for a good cause.  A breakthrough for the BNP will be the first true right-wing victory in the English speaking world and will send ripples throughout the political world in America, Canada, Australia, and Europe as a whole.  We should all be supporting them in their cause.<br>

			<p>Graham of Wales. I agree with everything you say - the people of Britain are moving to the Right, and who can blame them? I hope, however, that you are wrong about the BNP. They represent the only resistance to the EU-inspired de-racination of Britain, and the imposition of the NWO. I currently live abroad and I would not consider returning to England except under a BNP Govenment. Here&rsquo;s hoping.</p>

			<p>I know little of English politics, but it seems to me the ideal political path to rejuvinating England would be a new alliance between a BNP-like figure (without formal party connection) and an effective orator, united with the English work unions.</p>
<p>The Unions could get him elected, and he could guarantee the recovery of jobs by ending immigration indefinitely, and fighting to repeal the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; laws most offensive to the English voters. </p>
<p>This might well get him re-elected with a much larger majority, and give him the power to halt the middle-eastern cultural expansion within the country, while introducing measures strongly influencing foreign religious militants to alacritously return from whence they came.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t true at all. The BNP are becoming more popular every day. The Conservatives are just part of the tri-party state we live in, they will do nothing to stop immigration. Even if we stopped all immigration right now, and closed the borders forever, the U.K. would be majority non-white within 10 to 15 years. Yes, that soon.</p>
<p>Do you seriously think most white people are going to continue pretending that they love &#8216;diversity&rsquo; when they know that there is nowhere left to run, to escape non-white invaders? </p>

<p>Huh?  There are 54 million white and 6 million non-whites in the UK.  There is absolutely no way whites will be in the minority in 10-15 years.</p>

			<p>BNP (potential) voters should never believe Tories. They are like french Sarko who used National Front slogans before elections. After elected of course he had problems with memory &hellip;.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not Graham, but from what I&rsquo;ve downloaded of UK media, you would think the BNP was an illegal party, officially banned from the ballot.  As an observer from across the pond, I can see the crushing weight of the MSM bent on the BNP.  It must be sickening to be both a license-fee payer and supporter of the BNP, being forced to subsidize the hysterical smears against your own party.</p>

			<p>If you look at primary schools in the uk you can see the future . Its not white . The white majority is declining rapidly and is made of much older people .<br>
There are no reliable figures on race numbers .</p>

<p>I feel that I should clarify these remarks as some BNP supporters within Amren feel that their day of victory and subsequent position of power is about to arrive.<br>
Sadly, such feeings of imminent victory are hard to justify.<br>
Yes, as stated, Britons are wishing to see a more rightwing government in power.  However, this role could never be filled by the BNP. <br>
As,<br>
1) A powerful British media does not support the BNP and are hostile towards it.<br>
2) The BNP do not have the intellectual power to run a country as complex as 2009 Britain. <br>
3) In these harsh financial times many Britons, although they would like to see an end to colonisation by foreign diasporas, they wonder what the BNP has to offer over and above the open statement of this manifesto promise. Put simply, the BNP is seen as a one-trick pony and once you take away the rhetoric regarding closing borders there does not appear to be a lot left.  <br>
4) &#8220;A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.&#8221; (Albert <br>
Einstein)<br>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much faith in those official numbers. They are often cooked. Also non-Whites tend to have much higher birthrates then native Whites do. Also the age profile of the non-White communities is much younger then the general British population.</p>

			<p>Whites need to wake up, we have been misled by narrow minded journalists who endorse big government bureaucrats and discredit any 3 party candidates with unwarranted accusation, and unfounded reports&hellip; the BNP as succeeded in seating their candidates. We should strive to emulate the success the BNP as had in England. We should take a lesson from your friends across the pond. </p>

<p>&#8220;there &hellip; are six million non-Whites in the U.K&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>In 1968 when Enoch Powell made his prophetic speech there were 800,000. That&rsquo;s a 750% increase in roughly four decades. For that matter there were only 7,000 non-Whites in Britain in 1948 when the treasonous Marxist Labour party opened the doors. That&rsquo;s an approximately 86,000% increase in their numbers in about six decades. Even then Powell complained to the Labour party ministers about the dangers of allowing large numbers of colored people to settle in a White country and he was told that the British Commonwealth citizenship act was basically symbolic as &#8220;very, very, very few peope will ever come to settle here&#8221;. If anyone is interested check out a really good article by John Derbyshire written may 31st 2001 on Britain&rsquo;s post-war immigration folly.</p>

			<p>Even the Home Office admits that it has no idea who is currently living in the UK. There is simply no reliable way of quantifying the population of a country with open borders. I would guess that the true population is already in excess of 80 million, with somewhere between 25-35 million non-whites (and rapidly growing as their birthrates massively outstrip ours).</p>
<p>Censuses are useless. My two brothers both worked on recent censuses in London, and were instructed by their bosses to count any household that failed to respond as &#8220;two adults&#8221;. You can imagine who occupies most of the non-responding households, and you can also guess that there tend to be rather more than two adults (not to mention children) in occupation.</p>
<p>As a UK resident, I would be inclined to believe the anonymous poster who says that whites will be a minority here in 10-15 years&rsquo; time, and to treat all &#8220;official&#8221; statistics with the contempt that they deserve.</p>
