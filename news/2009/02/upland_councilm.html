			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Kelly, Los Angeles Times, January 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilman Ray Musser [of Upland], 73, said he was sorry for statements he made at Monday&rsquo;s council meeting when describing his experience at the inauguration of President Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was [sic] a lot of nonwhites in the crowd, well-behaved, and that was so gratifying,&#8221; he said at the meeting.</p>
<p>The remark caused an outcry, exacerbated when a local newspaper quoted Musser as referring to &#8220;colored&#8221; people. The council then scheduled the special meeting to demand his resignation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to reiterate my sincere apology to anyone who was offended by my choice of words describing the mass of Americans and world leaders&#8221; at the inauguration, Musser said in a statement. &#8220;My heart was touched by the inauguration, and I was proud to witness history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pomierski [Mayor John Pomierski, a political rival] said he decided to call off the special session before events spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>He said Musser, who has been on the council 10 years, was not a racist but a man from a different era.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Another groveling White man. I don&rsquo;t know about you guys, but I&rsquo;m REALLY getting sick of them. And why do blacks get mad about being called &#8220;colored&#8221;. Don&rsquo;t blacks call themselves &#8220;people of color&#8221;.</p>

			<p>  I am disgusted with the label &#8220;people of color!&#8221;  I am white but not an albino! Whites can range from milky white to olive-skinned Southern Italians and Greeks for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!  I think white people should start calling themselves &#8220;people of light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe is poor English was a point of contention&hellip;<br>
Seriously, you don&rsquo;t have to say much (if you&rsquo;re White, that is) to get into trouble. The silly old bloke was probably trying to be &#8216;nice&rsquo;.<br>
It would be heavy-handed to ask for an apology from him, let alone demand his resignation!</p>
<p>&#8220;He said Musser, who has been on the council 10 years, was not a racist but a man from a different era.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, people from a different era with borderline opinions must be silenced or even peanalised - change we can believe in my people!</p>

			<p>Councilman Muser is correct  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s always to surprising to see a large, well-behaved group of &#8216;colored people.&rsquo;  Make no mistake, though, had it not been for the tens of thousands armed military and police keeping order, we would have seen something that wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprising  &mdash;  random violence, looting, vandalism, and profanity-laced verbal attacks.    </p>

			<p>   Why was Ray Musser there in the first place? He was there to coddle to blacks. He deserves to be sacked for being there in the first place. People like him make me sick. Let&rsquo;s see how much he loves his black brothers and sisters after they get him fired and sue him.</p>

			<p>So let me get this straight. Musser, who of course happens to be &#8220;white&#8221;, gets slammed because he said that the &#8220;blacks&#8221; were well behaved. If, oh the other hand, the &#8220;blacks&#8221; had not been well behaved and had in fact burned the whole damn town down, and Musser had pointed that out, he would have been slammed as well! hmmmmm?</p>
<p>MoMo  </p>
<p>p.s. And I don&rsquo;t think the blacks were well behaved either - the way that the crowd treated Bush was absolutely disgraceful. </p>

			<p>So it&rsquo;s okay and often done that one may refer to oneself as &#8220;a person of color&#8221; yet it is wrong and hateful for one to say &#8220;people of color&#8221; or &#8220;colored people.&#8221;  That is at least, if they are not a &#8220;person of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truly just and free people of any color would not be threatened by any words and no words could ever be illegal.</p>

			<p>I am disgusted with the label &ldquo;people of color!&rdquo; I am white but not an albino! Whites can range from milky white to olive-skinned Southern Italians and Greeks for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! I think white people should start calling themselves &ldquo;people of light.&rdquo;<br>

<p>I know what you mean I had an Indian doctor make the same point, he said that only white people when they are sick can turn green, blue, yellow, red, purple etc. whilst being in various states or conditions. While &#8216;people of color&rsquo; in similar states just turn different shades of brown.<br>
<a href="https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=FEQ5l5JWguE&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=6FC7DA11A071021E&amp;index=47" rel="nofollow">https://au.youtube.com/watch?v=FEQ5l5JWguE&feature;=PlayList&p;=6FC7DA11A071021E&index;=47</a></p>
<p>A common critism that anyone who believes in racial differences gets is that &#8220;we are too hung up on the visual differences&#8221;[*].</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked the analogy of mixing paint(that I read on this forum in the past). Imagine that on a palette you have all the colors of the spectrum including the shades of black and white. And you mixed them all together, sure you would have &#8220;all the diversity of colors possible mixed together as one unified color&#8221;. But when it comes time to dip your brush into that mixture and actually paint with it, everything you paint will be a blackish/grayish/brown color of varying shades, and the more you mix it the more it will just become that one singular dirty color.<br>
A programmer friend of mine once told me that that when you have a large amount of data, that it is the &#8216;anomalies&rsquo; that are the most valuable parts or the rarities (black sheep or in this case the more aptly &#8216;white sheep&rsquo;) that defines the bottomline value of the whole.  </p>
<p>And back to the paint mixing analogy. It takes just the tiniest dab of black paint to taint a whole pottle of white paint and a helluva lot of white paint to eventually mix it back out again.<br>
And conversely if you mix a generous amount of white paint into the pottle of black it is simply absorbed and in essence lost forever.</p>

<p>Just like how many predicted that on november 4 blacks would be looting, rioting, raping, mudering, steal etc if Obama won or lost. How did that turn out by the way?</p>
<p>Wonder why affirmative action is still around? it&rsquo;s because of people like you.<br>

<p>Oh Beaumont you would be surprised!!  Last month a black woman was pressuring me to date a black man, one of her friends.  She said that because I&rsquo;d had an Italian boyfriend, I had dated a non-white man.  Therefore why, in her opinion, would it be any different for me to date a black man? It was very obvious that she just wanted me around for someone to provide a car, money, whatever, in a social setting.  It was a work situation and as I kept declining to meet her friend, within a week, the word &#8220;discrimination&#8221; started to be directed at me, at work.  Well hell yes, I&rsquo;m discriminating, and I WOULD be racist if I took that kind of guff from a non-white, but not from whites!  I held my ground, declined any further input into the project and got someone else assigned to it.  I was amazed that she thought Italians were not &#8220;white&#8221; people (whatever THAT means).</p>

<p>If whites only behave themselves, their problems with blacks will go away? Sounds like a misconstrued plan if I heard one. Let me know how it works out, in fantasy land. </p>
<p>It will only be when white men are denied &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too, that the whole hate whitey machine will seriously slow down in earnest. Affirmative action will be a little harder to swallow. Then, if too many black children grow up poor, too bad. Don&rsquo;t cry to the white man. The time for that will be over. </p>
