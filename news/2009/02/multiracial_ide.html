<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many people assume that individuals who identify with one race should be better off than multiracial individuals who identify with a mixed race heritage. However, a new study in the Journal of Social Issues found that students who reported they were from multiple ethnic/racial groups were more engaged at school and felt better in general than those who reported they were from a single group.</p>
<p>Kevin Binning, Ph.D., Miguel Unzueta, Ph.D., Yuen Huo, Ph.D., and Ludwin Molina, Ph.D., surveyed roughly 180 high school students to see how they were doing in school and how they felt in general: {snip}.</p>
<p>On several indicators (i.e. happiness, stress, citizenship behavior, and school alienation), students who reported they were from multiple groups were more engaged in school and felt better than those who reported they were from a single group.</p>
<p>Results suggest there may be a positive link between the tendency to embrace a multiracial identity and social and personal well-being.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>It only claims that these multiracial individuals were &#8220;more engaged&#8221; (what is that supposed to mean?) in school and they felt better about themselves.  It didn&rsquo;t say anything about their actually doing better in school, or being better people.  Then again, pretending to pay attention in school and having a high self-esteem is all that matters these days.</p>

<p>Gee, among whites this wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the fact that whites are constantly demonized, now would it? How would you feel if, day after day, you were constantly told in school, on TV, in books, in music and magazines that your race is evil and responsible for all the world&rsquo;s ills. </p>

			<p>What this study basically did was take 182 students with multi-racial backgrounds, divide them into three groups: those identifying as &#8216;multi-racial&rsquo;, those identifying as &#8216;high status&rsquo; (white or asian) and those identifyiing as &#8216;low status&rsquo; (black or latino). </p>
<p>They showed that stress levels were lower amongst those who identified as multi-racial as opposed to monoracial. <br/>
Self esteem was the same for high status and multiracial, but lower for &#8216;low status&rsquo; identities. </p>
<p>Having a multiracial identity leads to health benefits - in those who are actually multiracial. </p>
<p>The part after the &#8220;-&#8221; in the above sentence is what they are intentionally allowing to remain ambiguous. No monoracial students were included in this study. </p>
<p>This study says absolutely nothing about monoracial students.</p>

			<p><i>Results showed that, <b>compared with multiracial individuals who identified primarily with a low- or high-status group</b>, those who identified with multiple groups tended to report either equal or higher psychological well-being and social engagement. </i></p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a mulatto, don&rsquo;t call yourself black. Mr. Obama.</p>
<p>What the study doesn&rsquo;t say is whether they are happier than self-identified single-race individuals who actually <i>are</i> single-race.</p>

			<p>I haven&rsquo;t read a word.  Let me take a wild guess; it&rsquo;s all self-reported?</p>
<p>We all know mixed people would never over-compensate.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Study says today&rsquo;s mulattos not so tragic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like all leftist studies, a conclusion is reached, then the research is performed to support it.</p>
<p>As the corrupt politicians say, &#8220;Tell me what you want to prove, and I&rsquo;ll get a study completed that will support it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Is it necessary to say anything else?<br/>

			<p>Such lies.  It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>The poor kid who is of mixed race has no identity and is almost always straddling two worlds, not belonging really in either one, especially if he has an appearance that easily identifies him with more than one race.</p>
<p>Obama was lucky.  He had a lot of problems early on, but he could pass for black.  Imagine if he had grey eyes and freckles as some of them do with an even lighter skin.</p>
<p>I suspect he has problems today with his identity, buy he won&rsquo;t admit it.<br/>

			<p>Hollywood teaches kids that it sucks to be White and that diversity is cool.  The mixed kids are happy about that, no doubt.  Being a half-breed is as vogue as having the newest Blackberry or whatever. The real issue is raising the racial consciousness and self respect of White kids.</p>

			<p>Growing up as a white kid surrounded by liberals, I never heard one good thing said about white nationalism, although I heard lots said condemning racism. </p>
<p>In later years, as I discovered my heritage, I became filled with pride and feelings of personal well-being.  I would conclude that anyone can find their personal source of inner strength from their roots.  </p>
<p>Multi-racial kids probably spend more time than the average thinking about themselves and their origins, hence the study results.</p>

			<p>This is going to be common place in the future. They are brainwashing the masses into micegenation. It&rsquo;s at all levels of our society. From the president to news casters such as Soledad O&rsquo;brien, Kiran Chentry and Suzanne Malveux, down to the entertainment industry and the constant dumping of black male and racially androgenous females, such as Vanessa Hudgens and Jessica Alba onto the American psyche. Yesterday Yahoo ran a spread of Tiger Woods and his wife Elin and their mixed race children. They are trying to mesh us all into a black haired, browned eyed, olive skinned racial cluster(explicitive). </p>

			<p>According to the feature article in AmRen last month, blacks (and, therefore, mulattos) are deficient on abstract thinking. This makes them less concerned about future consequences of their actions, which - naturally - makes their lives care free. This, and not racism, is one of the main reasons why they fail, eventually.</p>

			<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;a new study in the Journal of Social Issues found that students who reported they were from multiple ethnic/racial groups were more engaged at school and felt better in general&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The old failed self-esteem movement of the 80s was based on feelings  &mdash;  it equated feeling better about yourself with academic ability. Low academic achievement and the achievement gap itself were blamed on blacks and hispanics feeling bad about themselves (along with White oppression, of course, can&rsquo;t leave that out).</p>
<p>For a decade, billions of educational dollars were wasted on raising the self esteem of blacks and hispanics.  The results?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Between 1975 and 1990, blacks and Hispanics narrowed the gap with whites on the reading test, but it has widened since then. In math and science, the racial gap has scarcely changed at all since 1975&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/ar/2004/02.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2004/02/</a></p>
<p>The self-esteem movement taught kids that believing in one&rsquo;s self allowed one to become &#8216;anything you can dream&rsquo;  &mdash;  a theoretical physicist, an applied mathematician, a world-class surgical pioneer, head of the team that will put a man on the moon. Indeed, the prevailing mantra was &#8216;If You Can Dream It, You Can Achieve It!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reminds me of the chants of &#8216;hope&rsquo;, &#8216;believe&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; before the last election  &mdash;  will the results be just as disastrous?<br/>
After all with lefties, it&rsquo;s feelings that count, not ability. They also know they will not be held accountable for their failures.</p>
<p>I believe Professor Rochester, author of Class Warfare sums up the entire self esteem movement best when he points out:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;a recent study by researchers from Case Western University and the University of Virginia found that high self-esteem, particularly artificially inflated self-esteem, ungrounded in real accomplishments, seems to be correlated with violent tendencies&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>The educational industrial complex will continue to twist itself into knots in a futile effort to explain away the ability gap  &mdash;  all the while knowing that the gap is based on IQ differences (which would be career ending to admit, after all, their academic positions are based on publishing theories and securing fat grants).</p>
<p>Better to delude the public and keep one&rsquo;s position by promoting the latest stupid brain-based theory than to end one&rsquo;s career labeled a racist, hater, Nazi or White supremacist.</p>

			<p>Multiracial, mixed race or whatever they call themselves are self-hating weirdos who think that everyone else owes them something. These people should be angry at their parents for causing them to be what they are, or are not. The bottom line is, is that a person who has parents from different races will love one parent and hate the other. Having mixed-raced children is a very big mistake.<br/>
