<h1><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/02/12/sports/sp-elgin-baylor-suit12">Baylor Sues Clippers, Alleging Racist Attitude</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Dillman, Los Angeles Times, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NBA Hall of Famer and former longtime Clippers executive Elgin Baylor alleges in a civil lawsuit filed Wednesday in Los Angeles that team owner Donald Sterling has embraced a &#8220;vision of a Southern plantation-type structure&#8221; for his NBA franchise, accusing him of decades-long racist behavior.</p>
<p>Baylor worked for the Clippers for 22 years. The complaint against Sterling and others, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by The Times, presented Baylor&rsquo;s version of an eroding relationship between Baylor and Sterling. Baylor contends, among other things, that the Clippers owner had &#8220;a pervasive and ongoing racist attitude as expressed to then-NBA player Danny Manning during contract negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also named in the lawsuit was the team, the NBA and Clippers President Andy Roeser. Clippers officials said at their game against the Knicks on Wednesday they had not been served with the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not having seen the complaint, I cannot comment on Elgin&rsquo;s specific allegations,&#8221; said Robert H. Platt, Clippers general counsel and partner at the law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. &#8220;However, I can categorically state that the Clippers always treated Elgin fairly throughout his long tenure with the team. Prior to his decision to leave the team last October, Elgin never raised any claims of unfair treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that he would now make these ridiculous claims after the organization stood by him for 22 years and only three playoff appearances. It would be hard to find any sports team that has demonstrated greater loyalty to its general manager. The team intends to vigorously defend itself against these false allegations and will prevail when all the facts are heard,&#8221; [said Robert H. Platt, Clippers general counsel and partner at the law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips].</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit alleged NBA Commissioner David Stern was present when Sterling allegedly said of Manning, &#8220;I&rsquo;m offering a lot of money for a poor black kid.&#8221; That tone was echoed in another alleged incident in which Baylor claimed Sterling told him that &#8220;he [Sterling] wanted the Clippers team to be composed of &#8216;poor black boys from the South&rsquo; and a white head coach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another part of the lawsuit dealt with Baylor&rsquo;s role in the organization. It alleged, as far back as 2004, Sterling and other club officials were employing &#8220;a campaign&#8221; to force Baylor into retirement  &mdash;  using &#8220;ageist comments&#8221; and &#8220;repeatedly hassling&#8221; him about quitting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit alleges &#8220;the Caucasian head coach was given a four-year, $22-million contract,&#8221; but Baylor&rsquo;s salary &#8220;has been frozen at a comparatively paltry $350,000 since 2003.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/02/supporters-of-f.html">Elgin Baylor &mdash; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Not In His Nature To Rock The Boat,&rsquo; Attorney Says</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Lisa Dillman, Los Angeles Times, February 12, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Supporters of former Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor rallied behind him today, including L.A. civil rights leader Earl Ofari Hutchinson, one day after the Hall of Fame player filed a civil lawsuit against the team and owner Donald Sterling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a news conference today, Baylor&rsquo;s attorney Carl Douglas was asked how the former Lakers star could work for the Clippers for so long in light of the lawsuit, which accuses the team and its owner of ongoing racist attitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing to remember about Elgin, he&rsquo;s humble. He&rsquo;s poised. He&rsquo;s gracious. It&rsquo;s not in his nature to rock the boat,&#8221; Douglas said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was one of 30 people that held those kind of jobs. It was his life, working in the city he loved. And he hoped that with his continued effort he&rsquo;d be able to turn the team around and make them into a winner. Regrettably he was tossed out before he was given that chance.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see what Donald Sterling did so wrong.  After all, for at least a few decades, he&rsquo;s been paying people and they&rsquo;ve been taking the money all the while falsely impersonating NBA players.  Whatever transgressions of good manners Sterling might have done is well offset by that.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m not a sports fan and know nothing about basketball, but it seems to me that there are a lot of facts missing in this article.  It seems to raise more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>He spent 22 yrs there under such &#8220;racist&#8221; working conditions because he was humble and didn&rsquo;t want to rock the boat??<br>
That&rsquo;s not the nature of a black.  They scream at the smallest slight, real or imagined.<br>
I am looking forward to the comments of other readers to enlighten me.  What&rsquo;s really going on here?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;s been sitting around talking to friends and family about his career and together, they&rsquo;re brainstormed this issue out of thin air.</p>
<p>After 22 years of this &#8216;racism&rsquo;, Baylor looks like he&rsquo;s about to cash in.</p>

			<p>Yes, knock me all you want, but I do watch the NBA. The Clippers are the worst sports franchise in the history of the NBA and quite possibly the entire professional sports world. The Detroit Lions are the only team I can think of that rival the stupidity of the ownership and general management of the Clippers. They played in that rat hole L.A. Sports Arena for years and could not even fill half of the arena. Nobody in L.A. likes them(they all like the Lakers)and I challenge any fan of the NBA to name 2 starters for them. The Clippers are a joke and I can&rsquo;t believe that the ownership stuck with Baylor for as long as they did. It proves they are not interested in winning just profiting from the NBA&rsquo;s generous money sharing program.</p>

			<p>He has to be the worst GM ever. In 22 years they went to playoffs..what 3 times?<br>
I always wondered why he kept his job. <br>
Baylor was an athlete but not exactly an operations genius.<br>
It seems he had it cushy for too long.<br>

<p><b>And the falsehood in this statement is&hellip;.???</b></p>
<p>Just goes to show you that ANYONE can deal the race card from the bottom of the deck - EVEN if you simply UTTER the word &#8216;black.&rsquo; Too bad because Baylor (and Jerry West, etc.) were really good players. The ONLY reason the Clippers (which were a MISERABLE team) kept Baylor on is <b>because he is black</b>.</p>
<p>And how does he repay them? &#8220;Y&rsquo;all racists. Show me da money.&#8221;</p>

<p>He should have PAID Sterling that much for some of those guys he drafted.</p>
<p>Anyway, a friend of mine in LA real estate tells me this story about the west coast Donald:</p>
<p>Sterling owns a lot of property in Koreatown.  Mostly multi-unit 5-10 floor residential buildings.  He had a live-in white guy managing one of the buildings and had a lot of problems with the black and Hispanic tenants.  He says one day Sterling calls him up and says &#8220;Dave&#8221;  from now on, I don&rsquo;t want any more blacks or Hispanics in my buildings, only Koreans.  Dave didn&rsquo;t like dealing with NAM&rsquo;s so he was all too happy to comply, &#8220;undesirable&#8221; tenants were evicted for minor transgressions, slight lateness on the rent, etc.  A little over a year later the entire building was Korean and Dave had very few problems to deal with.  </p>
<p>One day, Dave gets a letter thanking him for his service and says he will no longer be needed and asking him to move out in 45 days.  He did just that on on the day he was to move out of the building, to his astonishment, he saw a Korean guy moving into his office.</p>
<p>Dave sued and lost.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s precisely because of cases like Baylor, that so many colleges and universities of late have introduced new undergraduate degree programs in &#8220;Sports Management&#8221; into which they track their basketball and football scholarship ghettoletes.</p>

			<p>Where in the World is there a place where blacks are in charge and it is safe to walk the streets (even in broad daylight) the fact of the matter is it&rsquo;s not in Africa where everything whites built and left behind when they were forced out is now in ruins because blacks either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t maintain what was given to them at no charge. It&rsquo;s not Detroit where homes are being offered by the thousands in the $7500.00 price range with No Takers, homes that once sold for ten times and more that amount. It&rsquo;s surely not here in The Late Great America where Marxism, Socialism and ever Communist Ways seem to be getting stronger by the day, a place where liberals control the major media but are intent on destroying Conservative Talk Radio with Contitutional Defying New Laws to shut them down. What this guy is doing is taking this Racism Ploy to another level where the poor black man just can&rsquo;t get a chance because he is black and he is abused. When IF ever will we say &#8220;enough is enough already&#8221; ? I think the day of an American who doesn&rsquo;t want to be jailed to say that is disappearing at a Very Fast Rate.</p>

<p>Athletes in general dont care about their fans. After katrina you would think black atheles (who are an oppressed people) would donate some of their millions to katrina victims, schools, buildings, or roads to help build that place back up. But thats to much to ask for with these greedy atheletes, they dont care about anything but themselves.</p>
<p>Race seems to be the clutch now days. When the NBA got sick of all the rampant thuggery, they made NBA players wear suit instead of casual attire. That was label racism. These people are killing sports with their childish behavior.</p>

			<p>For 22 years his team was the worst in the NBA and he wonders why he got fired?</p>
<p>Then again it makes sense that a racist white would have the worst team in the NBA.</p>

			<p>But that is the African modus operandi in all cases relating to employment and education. If fired, it is because of racism, not stealing from the cash register. If not promoted, racism. Get a D- on the Algebra exam? Racism. Patient dies on the operating table? Racism. 22 years at 350,000 a year for doing the worst job of any of your peers? Racism.</p>
<p>America, when will you go deaf to this nonsense? Haven&rsquo;t you heard enough?</p>

			<p>Reply to &#8220;rational thinker&#8221;:</p>
<p> The POINT of my post was lost on you. My point was that the NBA has a mostly black athlete base but a mostly White fan base. Now a sport like hockey also has a mostly White fan base but is also mostly played by Whites. Lets&rsquo; assume that both groups of athletes don&rsquo;t care about their White fans (which I dispute, but regardless). My POINT was the racial hypocrisy of the black athletes in the NBA. To use a proper analogy you would have to show me a sport with a mostly White atletic base with mostly black fans. But you can&rsquo;t.</p>

			<p>He should sue the Lakers for finally winning an NBA title after he quit.  They went on a 33 game winning streak and won an NBA championship (their first one in LA) in the same season that he retired.  Guess the Lakers are racist too! </p>
