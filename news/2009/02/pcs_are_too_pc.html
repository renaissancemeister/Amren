<h1>PCs Are Too PC Over Immigrants, Claims Tory MP</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>yourcanterbury.com, February 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A police booklet for immigrants that makes Kentish people appear &#8220;racist, homophobic and xenophobic&#8221; has been blasted by a Conservative MP.</p>
<p>Gravesham representative Adam Holloway says the publication, A practical guide to the law for your safety and information, gives foreigners the wrong impression because it focuses too much on how to report racial abuse.</p>
<p>He also criticises the lack of any mention of the 999 service within the booklet, which instead promotes a hotline for immigrants who have become victims of crime due to their ethnic, religious or sexual background.</p>
<p>Mr Holloway said: &#8220;I find it extraordinary that Kent Police can produce a booklet that in a sense says &#8216;Welcome to Kent. We are racist, homophobic, xenophobic, ageist and do not value you if you are disabled or gay, and here&rsquo;s a booklet telling you how to make a complaint against us&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of message are we giving people? The police have their priorities wrong and have totally given in to this politically-correct and damaging claptrap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former investigative journalist, who once produced a documentary on asylum-seekers, praised the use in the booklet of illustrations of various crimes but questioned why the only telephone number promoted was the Kent Racial Incident Reporting Telephone Line.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Immigrants come here for a variety of reasons but mainly for work. They are our guests and have to abide by British law</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means produce a guide to the laws of our country but when they read page one of the English version of this book, they may think they are entering a rather disgusting society, which Kent certainly isn&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week Kent Police received widespread criticism for launching a gay essay-writing contest for young children as part of a month-long celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history.</p>
<p>Mr Holloway said it was about time PCs concerned themselves less with being PC and returned to what they did best  &mdash;  fighting crime: &#8220;I fear Kent Police is rather overdoing things. Their job is to protect the public and they need to calm down a bit on this sort of thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to remember what their job is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Leppard said the booklet replicated those issued by forces across the country and was given to people who had already contacted the police.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;We always welcome feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continually review our services so we can continue to police Kent in the most effective and resourceful way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the feedback we have received welcomes the non-emergency telephone numbers, as people may want to report crimes that are not life-threatening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kent Police treats everyone with fairness and equality. We do not tolerate any form of hate crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;The booklet raises awareness that hate crime is taken seriously by police and provides information about how to report it, helping ensure this type of crime is not under-reported.&#8221;<br>

			<p>If there are any hate crimes committed, it&rsquo;s now more likely that they will be at the hands of non-white &#8220;arrivals&#8221; against whites in Kent.  For they somehow have gotten it in their heads that the whites are all evil and mean spirited.  I wonder how they got that idea.</p>
<p>However, those hate crimes will be ignored.  The pump has been primed for every slight by a white Kentian against a non-white immigrant to be phoned in as a hate crime.  I&rsquo;m sure there will be dozens of them, real and imagined.  And the media&rsquo;ll tell us about each and every one.</p>

			<p>This guy makes a surprising amount of sense. The British National Party must really be growing. </p>

			<p>The Police have really become the NKVD of the far left since labour took power. I always believed that there were some police who deep down were decent people and this would hinder the establishment of any dictatorship but the past few years have really disabused me of this opinion and I now regard the police with suspicion and hostility. The police are a clear threat and danger to the patriotic cause and the knock on the door at night has turned out to be a terrible reality for some. Britain is now a far left police state not unlike the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe I studied at university. Alarming how this change has aterialised.</p>

			<p>This type of action is why the British national Party is gaining strength now in the UK with even some other elected Party representatives leaving their main stream party (Labour, Conservative and some Liberal)to join this legally registered political party, especially as the ordinary man in the street discovers the BNP is not the racist party as painted by the scared other Parties and is voting for them in local elections.  Most of its memebers are ordinary people who are sick to death of their country, Britain, no longer &#8220;Great&#8221;, being flooded out with unsuitable immigrants and on the British TV news tonight, there are reports of British soldiers in Afghanistan capturing Taleban fighters who have British accents who are fighting a &#8220;jihadh2 against supposedly their own fellow citizens (civil war?). If so they have committed treason and should be executed if found guilty and all their families expelled from Britain as accessories to their crimes.  The pendulum is slowly swinging back to sense again.</p>

			<p>Somebody has conned these dimwitted fools into believing their country will collapse if they don&rsquo;t import more consumers and tax units.</p>
<p>I call them &#8220;dimwitted,&#8221; because they can&rsquo;t see that by importing crime and poverty it has caused them a tremendous amount of money, and, in addition, constantly having to promote and enforce racist laws against their own people has got to be the dumbest thing ever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve caused their population ungodly problems.</p>
<p>They have so stupidly swallowed this whole diversity scam so completely, they wouldn&rsquo;t understand the folloy of what they have been scammed into believing if their lives depended on it.  And, as it turns out, their lives literally DO depend on it.</p>
<p>The fools will fall hard during 2009 and afterwards, and like other fools throughout history will live to regret their stupidity a thousand times over.</p>

<p>This really does sound like a comedy sketch. A month to &#8216;celebrate&rsquo; that? About five minutes would do.<br>
What has this got to do with law enforcement? Are all police forces throughout G.B like this?<br>
One day all of this will end, but it&rsquo;s going to be very messy!</p>

<p>As long as &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; is considered something that whites do to non-whites (regardless of the exploading murder rates), real hate crimes are being under-reported, and are not being taken seriously. So this booklet is really about encouraging us to ignore hate crimes?</p>

			<p>This is just one more segment in a multi faceted war against the English people. The Police now are a political enforcement organisation hell bent on suppressing righteous indigenous indignation of the impact of this war on their lives. I would advise all my fellow citiszens to get out and leave them to it. It is a war that has been long lost as our mainstream politicos of LabLibCon are virtually identical on matters of culture and immigration. Bail out while you can before the UK becomes an ugly East German type nation on the edge of Europe funded by English Milchcows for the benefit of Third World Immigrants. </p>

			<p>How on earth did this AMREN find this article? I originally come from Canterbury and went to school with Adam Holloway, the MP in question. He was a very popular guy at school and an all round sensible fellow.</p>
<p>Here is a link from the Canterbury Police website https://www.kent.police.uk/Diversity/Report%20Hate%20Crime.html</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real wonder why immigrants would wish to come to the UK if we are all as racist as the Kent Police would have us believe.</p>

			<p>The police website says: Hate crime is any offence committed against a person or property that is motivated by the offender&rsquo;s hatred of people who are seen as being different. You can be a victim of hate crime because of your race, religion, disability, age, sexuality or gender.</p>
<p>By that logic, those 300 Spartans were committing a hate crime when they slaughtered the Persian invaders at the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.   Defending their home and resisting encroachment by foreign invaders would be considered a hate crime by the Kent police.  </p>
