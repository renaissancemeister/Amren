<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28965042/">Hispanic to Lead Texas University System</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mexican-American pediatric surgeon will become the first Hispanic to preside over a major U.S. university system when Dr. Francisco Cigarroa takes the helm at the University of Texas System, which faces financial woes and complaints about diversity.</p>
<p>Cigarroa, a 51-year-old pediatric transplant surgeon from Laredo, looks at his new job as the system&rsquo;s new chancellor starting Monday as an opportunity to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cigarroa, as the chief executive officer of the UT System, will help administer an $11.5 billion operating budget and preside over 15 campuses with more than 194,000 students.</p>
<p><b>Complaints over soaring tuition costs</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cigarroa has refused to specify his views on tuition restraints but said school UT officials and legislators have to work together to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more passionate about the prospect of changing admissions policies, which currently dictate automatic entry to state universities for students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class.</p>
<p>UT wants the policy relaxed so it can have more say about who gets in the door. At UT-Austin, more than 80 percent of the Texas freshmen gained admission though the top 10 percent provision.</p>
<p>Cigarroa said the system could keep or even increase diversity in the student body even if the top 10 percent law is modified or eliminated.</p>

		<p>Universities, it seems, have gone back to their roots - as organs of organized religion.  I once was under the impression that the prime goal of universities was to educate.  Obviously I was wrong.  Their prime goal is to promote the religion of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Par for the course. You put them in charge and the first thing they do is find ways to increase their numbers. Another major Texas university put a Hispanic in charge and the first thing she did was eliminate tuition for students whose parent(s) earn less than 60K a year. This move guaranteed an explosion of Hispanic enrollment because it basically gives free education to Hispanics. What is pathetic is that there was absolutely no protest against this obviously partisan move.</p>

		<p>Actually the whole idea behind the Top Talented Ten was to increase diversity.The idea was that even if you are a black or Hispanic student with a G.P.A. of 2.1 as long as you in the top 10 percent of that school you should be able to be accepted into college.With the high drop out rate for Blacks and Hispanics they might as well let anyone in who manages to get a High school Diploma.Next they will make some real progress and admit high school dropouts to college.</p>

		<p>Put a Hispanic or black in charge of any position that has absolutely nothing to do with race, and the one thought uppermost in their minds is manipulating the system to get their own tribesmen in.</p>
<p>This is just more proof that multiculturalism/multiracialism is an abysmal failure.</p>
<p>The great thing about the situation now evolving, however, is that the economic plunge is throwing up roadblocks for these biased bigots like the man in this story, just as it is to Obama and the new world order crowd.</p>
<p>I read yesterday where the oddball in charge of Australia wrote a piece declaring that now is the time to invoke a new world order, because of the crash.</p>
<p>Lots of luck, Charlie.  What is going to occur is going to force you to snap to attention and take note of what the real world is all about, and it isn&rsquo;t the creation of new world orders.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, true justice would be for this weird man to have to work at the car wash where he&rsquo;s not endangering people and societies with his hare-brained schemes that appear to be fresh out of the third grade.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a new world order all right, but it&rsquo;s nothing even remotely similar to what this mentally challenged demagogue envisions.</p>

		<p>This policy will inevitably mean a decline in the quality of UT as existing coursework is dumbed down and more remedial courses added.  One may also expect a great expansion in Hispanic studies, etc. I saw this sort of thing happen to CCNY (City College of New York) with its open admissions policy, adopted in 1970 after the campus was taken over by African-American and Puerto Rican activists. I ran into a young professor of physical chemistry from CCNY shortly thereafter who lamented the fact that there were only 11 students (if I remember right) out of the whole school in the one beginning course on physical chemistry. In recent years, CCNY has started to tighten up its entrance requirements.  But at least in the intervening years, a great institution that provided a low-cost, high-quality education and upward mobility to bright students of modest means was destroyed. </p>

		<p>This is fantastic news.  If UT gets overrun by unqualified hispanics, just like the rest of the state, Texas will become no different from Mexico, and we won&rsquo;t have an illegal invasion problem any more because they&rsquo;ll have no reason to come here.</p>
<p>Or we could return this country to a meritocracy on which it was founded, protect our borders with armed agents, and have he same effect and save billions of taxpayer dollars in the process.  No, that makes too much sense.</p>

		<p>Relaxed means more mental aids.</p>
<p>Do you realize that India has more children with high IQ&rsquo;s, in the genius category, then we have children in the USA?</p>
<p>Now, how will this turn out? Who will rule?  The dolts we keep telling are special or the actual special ones?</p>

		<p>Each time I read a story decrying the lack of diversity at universities I am left speechless - almost.  If a person of any color is intelligent enough to gain admission they will.  If a person is not - they will anyway, just not at a flagship university like UT.  </p>
<p>There are many post-secondary institutions that will accept anyone who can mark an X on an admission application and a financial aid form.  Anyway - I have to question the intelligence of those who think that a high school student with a weak GPA will suddenly blossom into an avid learner in a top-tier university.  I&rsquo;m sure that it happens but people get struck by lightening too.  </p>
<p>We all know that this is simply social engineering but to what ultimate end?  Is this part of a move to destroy the white middle class to usher in a socialist world government?  I&rsquo;m running out of non-conspiratorial explanations.</p>

		<p>In some states that have guaranteed admission for the top grads of every high school, Whites have been taking advantage of the system.  They put their kid in a school full of non-White dullards, where they are by default the best students.  A risky strategy, but I know of a couple local school board members that have got their kids into the top state university that way.  </p>

		<p>diversity is a joke. I hope this is on Jared Taylor&rsquo;s radar. Elimination of admission policies - for minorities. Isn&rsquo;t that called racism ? - Preference based on color ? Nice to see our public universities trampling on our constitution - which is now  complete joke.</p>
