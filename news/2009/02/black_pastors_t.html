<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29286925/">Black Pastors to Ask Burris to Resign</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, February 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of black ministers who supported U.S. Sen. Roland Burris as he fought to get his job now plan to ask for his resignation following revelations that he tried to raise money for the disgraced governor who appointed him, one of the ministers told The Associated Press on Thursday.</p>
<p>Many of the city&rsquo;s influential black pastors supported Burris because of his scandal-free reputation  &mdash;  even though he was appointed by then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich three weeks after the governor was arrested for allegedly trying to sell the Senate seat.</p>
<p>Now some of those pastors will ask Burris to resign, according to the minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a meeting with Burris had not yet been scheduled.</p>
<p>Burris testified before an Illinois House committee in January that he hadn&rsquo;t had contact with key Blagojevich staffers or offered anything in return for the Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Last weekend, however, Burris released an affidavit saying he had spoken to several Blagojevich advisers, including Robert Blagojevich, the former governor&rsquo;s brother and finance chairman, who Burris said called three times last fall asking for fundraising help. Burris changed his story again this week when he admitted trying, unsuccessfully, to raise money for Blagojevich.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Burris is, like Obama was, the only black U.S. senator. Blacks were among his biggest defenders as Burris overcame Senate leaders&rsquo; resistance to admitting a senator appointed by a man charged with trying to sell the office.</p>

			<p>Are we supposed to believe that black Chicago preachers really want a black U.S. Senator to resign because he&rsquo;s corrupt?  Pot kettle black.  They have some sort of angle.  I haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, but the best theory I can come up with is that they fear Burris might fumble the ball and the Republicans can pick it up in 2010, so they want some clean-gene Democrat (even if it&rsquo;s white) to keep voting liberal in the Senate.</p>
<p>The trouble with that theory is that it falsely assumes that the Illinois Stupid (Republican) Party is two things:  (1) Politically savvy and clever, and (2) Right wing.  Either they&rsquo;ll send up another Ryan, or truck in some Alan Keyes figure.  No way in Hades that the DuPage County Plutocrats Club is going to let some right-winger have a chance.</p>

			<p>Of course they want him out.  Then they can get Jesse&rsquo;s son.</p>

			<p>Frankly, Burris is the BEST of the worst in Illinois; I&rsquo;d rather have him compared to all the Danny Davises, Jesse Jacksons and Bobby Rushs that are being offered in his place. You WILL regret it if he is replaced with another BLACK face, I&rsquo;m warning you!</p>

			<p>Burris is probably the best of the corrupt Chicago Democratic Machine.  When are these people going to recognize that Barack Obama is a product of the same system that produced Blogojevich and Burris and is probably a hell of a lot dirtier than either of them.</p>

			<p>Mark my words this is all part of a larger plan. If these Rev&rsquo;s are asking this clown to resign there is something more to it. The more is that he resigns and goes away and then the criminal case against Gov Blogo also falls apart and goes away. Does anybody really believe there will be a criminal trial against Gov Blogo, with all the testimony and calling of witnesses pointing right at the personage of THE ONE HIMSELF? Blogo is probably drooling, panting, and breathing hard at the chance to dump all over THE ONE. So no trial no testimony. The fix is in.</p>

			<p>The loss of even a couple of senators would put the kibosh on Obama&rsquo;s ambitions.  He could kiss universal health care and amnesty good bye.  That combined with a Republican takeover of the house in 2010 would be a disaster for the liberals.  </p>
