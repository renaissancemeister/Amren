<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/10/akakas-sovereignty-fight-garners-obamas-backing/">Akaka&rsquo;s Sovereignty Fight Garners Obama&rsquo;s Backing</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Richardson, Washington Times, February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Akaka, Hawaii Democrat, reintroduced the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, better known as the Akaka bill. The proposal would give Native Hawaiians, those who can trace their ancestry to the arrival of Capt. James Cook, the explorer, in 1778 similar status to that of American Indians by allowing them to acquire public lands and form their own semisovereign government.</p>
<p>Lining up in support of the Akaka bill are House and Senate Democrats, the Hawaiian Legislature, the governor of Hawaii and President Obama, himself a native-born Hawaiian, albeit not a Native Hawaiian, who said during the campaign that he would sign the bill.</p>
<p>Waging a frantic campaign to stop the bill are a cluster of conservative think tanks, a few Republican lawmakers and a handful of conservative columnists. If it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a fair fight, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s probably not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s backers argue that Native Hawaiians deserve the same rights of self-governance and self-determination as other indigenous people. They point to the overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii by American and European businessmen in 1893, calling it a wrong that needs to be addressed by repatriating lands and sovereignty to Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Akaka bill doesn&rsquo;t say how much land would be turned over to a newly formed Native Hawaiian government, only that no private lands would be confiscated. That leaves about 2 million acres, now controlled by the federal and state governments, that could be up for grabs, or about 38 percent of the island&rsquo;s landmass.</p>
<p>A study conducted by the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University and released Monday estimates that the bill could cost the state up to $690 million a year in lost revenue, given the loss of land and tax base.</p>
<p>The Akaka bill doesn&rsquo;t explicitly say that Native Hawaiians, who number about 400,000, or 20 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, would be exempt from state income and sales taxes, but that&rsquo;s the expectation among supporters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a recent conference here at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, sponsored by the Federalist Society, critics said the Akaka bill&rsquo;s passage could lead to similar separatist movements by other distinct racial minorities, such as those of Mexican ancestry in the Southwest or Cajuns in Louisiana.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the fear that the bill could lead Hawaii to break from the union, although Mr. Akaka insisted the legislation allows neither secession nor the authorization of gambling.</p>
<p>&#8220;If ethnic Hawaiians can be an Indian tribe, then why not Chicanos in the American Southwest? There are people who firmly believe that the Southwest United States is part of Aztlan,&#8221; said Gail Heriot, a University of San Diego School of Law professor. &#8220;What about the Amish? Who&rsquo;s going to have the political will to draw the line here?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This comes despite polls showing that most Hawaiians oppose the bill and even Native Hawaiians are divided when told that they would be subject to a different legal and tax system, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, critics argue that without a plan in place, the result could be mayhem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly the state of Hawaii won&rsquo;t have this money any more. Then there&rsquo;s the question of which services the state of Hawaii will no longer be provided to Native Hawaiians,&#8221; Miss Heriot said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be chaotic, but the bill itself cheerily goes on.&#8221;<br>

			<p><i>&ldquo;If ethnic Hawaiians can be an Indian tribe, then why not Chicanos in the American Southwest?</i></p>
<p>Except:<br>
1. Most of these &#8220;Chicanos&#8221; <b>never lived in the American Southwest</b> - I&rsquo;ve heard that most of the Mexicans living in the American Southwest were criollos (white Spaniards or other whites born in Latin America), few of whom left for Mexico after it was <b>purchased</b> by the United States.<br>
2. Following on that, I&rsquo;d bet <b>none</b> of these &#8220;Chicanos&#8221; were descended from south-west Native American tribes - and probably have some Spanish admixture too:<br>
Should Haitian mulattoes have a claim to settling the British Isles, as they are part-&#8220;indigenous European&#8221;?</p>
<p><i>There are people who firmly believe that the Southwest United States is part of Aztlan,&rdquo; said Gail Heriot, a University of San Diego School of Law professor.</i></p>
<p>Except:<br>
1. &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; was the home of a <i>single</i> Mexican tribe, out of many that lived in what is now &#8220;Mexico&#8221; - I&rsquo;d bet few Mexicans could trace their lineage to a <i>single</i> &#8220;Aztec&#8221; ancestor.<br>
2. &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; <b>is mythical</b>, and even the Aztecs only knew that it was &#8220;somewhere north&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;What about the Amish? Who&rsquo;s going to have the political will to draw the line here?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, the &#8220;political line&#8221; most Leftist groups are drawing is between:<br>
* Non-white &#8220;self-determination&#8221; groups, and<br>
* White &#8220;self-determination&#8221; groups.</p>
<p>Case in point: Find an article on the <a href="http://bnp.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">British National Party website</a> on white British dispossession/replacement etc, replace <b>every</b>reference to &#8220;British&#8221;, &#8220;white&#8221;, &#8220;Britain&#8221;, &#8220;England/Scotland/Ireland/Wales&#8221; with &#8220;indigenous Hawaiian&#8221;, &#8220;Hawaii&#8221; etc - hand said article to any Leftists living near you and see if they support the policies of the &#8220;Hawaiian National Party&#8221;.</p>
<p>But otherwise, I support the Hawaiian&rsquo;s drive for ethnic sovereignty, but the hypocritical stance by the Leftists that Hawaiians - as non-whites - somehow <b>deserve</b> ethnic sovereignty more than the indigenous whites of Europe (who <i>must</i> be &#8220;diversified&#8221; out of existance) is annoying, to say the least.</p>

<p>Some of the best news I&rsquo;ve heard lately.</p>
<p>This will open the way to secession by other states and areas, and just might enable us to partition the US without civil warfare.</p>
<p>Let them have their areas, along with the addled-minded, hare-brained whites, and we&rsquo;ll have ours, making certain white traitors will NEVER be allowed to enter.</p>

			<p>I say let Hawaii go, it is still just a party place now, and of no strategic OR tactical value to the U.S.</p>

			<p>They never should have made Hawaii a state. It was a bad, bad mistake. Hawaii has none of the requirements for statehood in my view. By the way the population of Hawaii is 1,283,388 according to the latest census.  &hellip;&#8221;native Hawaiians who number about 400,00 or 20% of the state&rsquo;s population&#8221;&hellip;.  20% of Hawaii&rsquo;s population is 256,677 odd souls. Where did this imaginary 144,000 extra Hawaiians come from?</p>

			<p>Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t get too worked up over this. Yes, there is the usual double standard (non-whites having their own government is good; white Southerners trying to have their own government is bad).</p>
<p>But whites are a small segment of Hawaii and the island certainly has an Asian ethos. This is a concern for Hawaiians. Let them fight it out amongst themselves. If the Hawaiians make a mess of their island then nobody will go there. Since tourism is their only real industry then the place will decline and the islanders will suffer.</p>

			<p>   Actually, Hawaii has been promoting a seccession movement for some time now. I wish them the best of luck. Maybe the will set a trend for alot more states to follow.</p>

			<p>The Hawaiians are going for the same scam that Indians who live on reservations enjoy: being exempt from paying state, local and property taxes while still being eligible to collect welfare checks.</p>

			<p>       Under the Kosovo Doctrine, they have the right. It would<br>
be easier for all concerned if they would settle for one whole<br>
island intead of pieces of each. And by all means wish them luck-<br>
we can use the precedent when our turn comes.</p>

			<p>Given the East Asian majority in Hawaii, I just wonder what they would stand to gain from this.  Perhaps they&rsquo;re using the natives as a wedge to force out whites, who are their only intellectual competition for power?  I just can&rsquo;t see a Japanese or Chinese supporting a separatist movement made up of Hawaiian Polynesians, who most East Asians consider to be even lower than Filipinos, unless they themselves had something to gain from it.</p>

			<p>This is great!</p>
<p>With so many separatists clammering for their own territory (hawaiins, Aztlan mexicans, etc.,) there is no way the United States will survive!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Collapsed and soon the U.S. will collapse too (look at economy).  One down, one to go!!!</p>
<p>Whites need to keep in mind the Pacific Northwest Imperative.</p>

			<p>Hawaii should become an independent nation.  </p>
<p>It is a net cost to the US.<br>
It is no longer of any particular strategic value.</p>
<p>Adios, it&rsquo;s been fun.</p>

<p>&gt; No, it won&rsquo;t open a way to succession.  </p>
<p>Again, this breakup of the U.S. is a pipe dream and the wish of our enemies abroad.  IF it were to occur, nations who are NOT breaking up would simply take over all our interests world wide and then begin to work on regions within the continent.  In the unlikely event that an solely White nation/region could be formed with any stability.  Who is going to decide who gets to belong and how does anyone imagine that it will suddenly become a self-sustaining entity when most of its members refuse the idea of community action and support - adhering to the ethos that the individual is important and they only gather for prayer meetings?  What outside nations or entities are likely to be trading partners?</p>
<p>This entire notion is pure bunk.  The only way to preserve the White race is for White children to be taught to value themselves as White people and for Whites in general to stop selling themselves out.  Carrying on with the idea that &#8220;leftist regions&#8221; are not worth holding onto is a mistake.  Remember that not that long ago, California was a conservative dominated state.  With Mexico collapsing the idea that Mexico is going to take over the Southwest is gone.  Have some patience!</p>
<p>I think that it is inevitable that we will live with many non-Whites around us into the foreseeable future and that no sort of sucession is ever going to happen.  What will preserve us is our attitude toward ourselves, not our attitude towards non-Whites.</p>

			<p>The shortfall in Hawaii&rsquo;s budget will be made up by whom?  Guess.  And why does the minority (20%) get to say what Hawaii needs and wants?</p>
