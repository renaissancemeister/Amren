<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As private, independent schools see the diversity of their student bodies increasing, they are on a push to recruit more minority teachers who mirror those students and society.</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Independent Schools Consortium  &mdash;  composed of Seven Hills School, Summit Country Day School, Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, St. Ursula Academy and St. Xavier High School  &mdash;  will hold its first Educators of Color Career Fair noon to 2 p.m. Feb. 28.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In all of our schools, we believe that everyone benefits from being a part of a diverse learning environment,&#8221; said Michelle Alexander, committee chair and Seven Hills&rsquo; director of diversity and community outreach.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our world becomes more diverse, it is important that our faculty and staff reflect the demographics of the society in which we live. To that end, all of our schools are seeking diverse candidates for various administrative, faculty and staff positions in our schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yngrid Thurston, director of diversity and inclusion at Summit Country Day, said discussions among the schools revealed that they are attracting a diverse student population, so it&rsquo;s important that these students see more teachers who are like them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twenty-two percent of the student population at Summit is non-white. The number of minority teachers wasn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge is these schools don&rsquo;t have a high degree of turnover in teaching positions, and there&rsquo;s not a large pool of minority candidates,&#8221; Jellig said. &#8220;We just have really struggled, as many schools have, to get a lot of faculty of color.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently theres not much love for the white teachers who are doing the job day in and day out, for the remaining 78%. </p>

Local black talk radio did an interview with a black teacher and they discussed this issue.</p>
<p>The teacher gave a remarkably honest and straightforward explanation of why there are few black teachers.</p>
<p>She said most blacks don&rsquo;t want to be teachers because they know how black students behave.</p>
<p>The host wasn&rsquo;t too please with the answer.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Non-white students have to have teachers &ldquo;who are like them.&rdquo; </p>
<p><br>
And out of the other sides of their mouths they will say that there&rsquo;s no differece in the races, that we&rsquo;re all the same except for skin color.</p>
<p>Blacks have earned their lower status of intelligence and incidents like this this remind us of it almost everytime they open their mouths and utter something stupid.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d give them all teachers who look like them in addition to students also.</p>
<p>Segregation is the only thing that works.</p>

			<p>The real problem is that minority candidates have been excluded from the teaching profession because of their consistent failure to pass state-mandated competency tests. Unfortunately it still boils down to the inconvenient truths about black IQ.</p>

			<p>I remember our first diversity teacher almost thirty-five years ago. An Algebra teacher she was. The kids quickly found out that she knew even less about math than they did! Instead of snitching her off, there was a silent agreement that even the new teacher didn`t know about. The kids didn`t let on to administration that she was as dumb as dirt and in return the children got better grades than they  probably would have with someone else without  really having to work for them.</p>

			<p>How long have these diversity dolts been singing the same tune? Teachers &#8216;who looked like them&rsquo; haven&rsquo;t helped black kids progress one iota. In fact, I bet many of the most successful blacks today had the old white male &#8216;iron fist&rsquo; teachers with the black hornrimmed glasses back in the fifties and early sixties. These posh private schools are just run by the same wine and cheese liberals who have ruined all of the other institutions in our country. I wouldn&rsquo;t send my child to a school that employed a &#8216;director of diversity and inclusion.&rsquo;</p>

			<p> The school say that it is essential that more minority teachers be recruited to teach minority students. This shows that the schools believe that white teachers cannot teach non-whites and it should follow that non-white teachers are not suitable for whites.<br>
 This is another indication that educators believe that different races cannot learn from each other.  That implies that different races should not live together and that diversity is division and not working.</p>

			<p>Hmm. Our 2nd quarter grades are in, and it looks like once again our black and Hispanic students are trailing behind our white students.  We have do something.  What can we do?  </p>
<p>Of course! Let&rsquo;s get rid of our white teachers and hire black and Hispanic ones in their place!  It worked out wonderfully for the public schools, so it should work for us too!  Obviously, white teachers are just mentally deficient because they can&rsquo;t understand how black students think, so we just can&rsquo;t let them in the same room with those precious, divinely gifted children of color.  Only when our faculty better reflects our student population will the racial gap in education be eliminated and all our students will reach their full potential.<br>

			<p>This is fine with me. Let blacks teach blacks. In my experience, once the black student population rises above the magical 10-12%, their hatred, resentment, and disrespect for whites disrupts the educational process to the point that it&rsquo;s pointless anyway.</p>
<p>I doubt they&rsquo;ll do any better with black teachers, but at least they won&rsquo;t have anyone else to blame for their failure!</p>

<p>Your second paragraph is tongue-in-cheek (at least for you), but there is someone with serious power that actually believes it.  It&rsquo;s the State Education Superintendent for California, Jack O&rsquo;Connell.</p>
<p>The current Governor of California is term limited out, so the 2010 election will mean a new Governor.  Because the broom closet known as the California GOP has no more steroid junkie bad actors to run up the flagpole, it is the conventional wisdom that the winner of the Democrat Primary will be the new Governor.  San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom is going to run, but I think Jack O&rsquo;Connell will win   &mdash;   he has statewide name rec, I&rsquo;m sure the state teachers unions will endorse him, and he&rsquo;s pandering to the right minorities by picking on white teachers.  Newsom, on the other hand, is a one-city one-constituency sideshow.</p>

			<p>Tim Mc Hugh,</p>
<p>It was 33 years ago for me in the sixth grade that I was exposed to my first diversity teacher. A black woman replaced our white teacher, who left on maternity leave two months into the new school year. Our new &#8220;teacher&#8221; made us start over on all courses from the beginning of year instead of continuing from where we were. She did this because she could not catch up to our sixth grade class or it was just too much trouble for her. One of the boys in our class corrected her when she was incorrectly showing us how to do simple subtraction of large numbers - she sent him to the principal&rsquo;s office. This boy&rsquo;s parents were successful in promptly getting their son into another sixth-grade class in our school before he too far behind (like the rest of us ended up being).</p>
<p>We had no black kids in our class or school, yet our new black &#8220;teacher&#8221; replaced our American history class with African history. It was actually quite entertaining for 11-year-old kids seeing their teacher coming to school dressed in full African garb and trying to teach us about African tribe leaders that were of no consequence to anything.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until pretty much all of the parents demanded her replacement or to have their kids moved to other classes. The principal refused to do either and I got my first education on affirmative action by overhearing my parents lamenting the situation. We were all behind in our courses by the end of the year and many of the higher-achieving student&rsquo;s parents (mine included) enrolled us in summer school so we wouldn&rsquo;t be behind for the algebra, geometry, trig, calc college prep sequence. As much as I hated it that summer, looking back it wasn&rsquo;t a complete waste. I caught up, but, more importantly, I learned at an early age the value of diversity and the heavy tax of affirmative action.</p>
<p>To top it all off, a few years later I learned from another teacher at the school that (after having to deal with loads of pissed off parents each year) the principal had demoted our AA teacher to the fourth-grade but made her the head of the math department!</p>
<p>God help us.</p>

			<p>Long hours, poor pay, and no respect, and you will be expected to teach a classroom of black students. From personal experience, you know how well behaved they will be.<br>
   Black people are not that stupid. There are plenty of Affirmative action jobs out there that are better.  <br>

			<p><i>Non-white students have to have teachers &ldquo;who are like them.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>We need president and his administration who look like us, the majority of Americans.</p>
<p>We need neighbors, co-workers, business partners, and colleagues who look like us.</p>
<p>We need a nation state that will have our ethno-centric, and no one else&rsquo;s, interest in heart.</p>
<p>We need to rid our country of &#8220;minorities&#8221; who treat it as new, gigantic breeding grounds.</p>
<p>We need to promote our own, and no one else&rsquo;s, genetic interest. This is the meaning of our right to pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if other races are dumbier or smarter than we are. Let them enjoy the blessings of their liberty in their countries, not ours.<br>

<p>Huh? Has the definition of this word changed since the last time I looked? If they were seeking diverse candidates would they not be seeking whites as well as blacks and perhaps other kinds of people? If they hired all blacks, would it then be 100% diverse? Crazy stuff.</p>

			<p>With average IQs of 85 Afr-Americans&rsquo; scholastic performance is not going to be helped by having teachers of the same race. This has been repeatedly endlessly,proven, ad nauseam. But the phony issue of teachers being from the same race as students has more to do, with reserving jobs for non-whites, than any fantasy about improved performance.  </p>

<p>So do Whites! Yet if we want segregated schools we&rsquo;re racist! If we don&rsquo;t bend over backward to befriend, mingle and associate with Blacks, we&rsquo;re racist! If we don&rsquo;t urge our White children to have sex with Black lovers, we&rsquo;re racist! Any White person starting a business, who doesn&rsquo;t have Black partners (with the White, of course, supplying the capital and brains), is a racist! Now, children&hellip; are there any questions?</p>

<p>The demand for &#8220;diversity&#8221; to be thrust upon whites,  but &#8220;mirrors&#8221; that &#8220;reflect the students and society&#8221; for blacks. </p>

			<p>Go ahead and hire 22 percent of people of color to teach the 22 percent of students of color. No more and no less. When they do this they should ask the liberal, diversity believing white teachers to give up their jobs in the name of diversity. What howls you will have! They should also install video cameras to document poor black behavior. This should stop the claims that high numbers of suspensions or detentions are racially based.</p>

			<p>What a lot of hypocrites exist in this world.  In South Africa, Apartheid was designed to achieve this end so that the African blacks (as opposed to the African whites and Indians) could learn within their own abilities for the whites knew from actual experience that the blacks generally were very slow to learn, if they could at all, but the world screamed racism.  The results were that far too many blacks failed their courses but when Mandela the terrorist took over the subsequent rallying cries at the black universities were &#8220;Pass one, pass all.&#8221;  That is why sadly now a South African degree that used to be as good as any in the world in te old days, is now viewed with suspicion by most outside of South Africa/Africa.</p>
<p>Most Westerners read and believed the propaganda spouted out by the Marxist terrorists who have now taken over South Africa and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe instead of researching what it was all about. Apartheid had a few bad rules but they would have faded away eventually. But true history, not that written by the current Marxist leaders or those who do not bother to consider what has happened there, as it is/will, in Zimbabwe, will show the real facts from results 8 (for all future failures, even in 100 years will be blamed on Apartheid) and will cause all to think why did we do what we did to force the old successful white governments out?  They knew what was needed and how to achieve success, a happy life especially by African standards, for all within each of their abilities.</p>
<p>After all, did all those who wanted the Rhodesian blacks to have their freedom, want them to be murdered (up to 30.000 in the early 1980s by Mugabe), starve and die of diseases such as cholera, and be burnt (or bludgeoned) to death by necklacing by other xenophobic blacks in South Africa where they had fled to eat and live?</p>
<p>I sometimes think that the ulterior motive of these Westerners who wanted the African Black to have his &#8220;freedom&#8221; under a black government knew that it would mean the deaths of hundreds of thousands of them as has happened in Africa already with AIDS, return of many of the once beaten diseases, genocide by gangster black rulers, etc.  After all the world population has far too many humans even now.</p>

			<p>Apartheid was put in place to separate the various tribes.  Each &#8220;ethnic group&#8221; was given a &#8220;homeland&#8221;.  Separation was the only way to keep them from killing each other.  My expat friends from South Africa lament the lies that our main stream media fomented about &#8220;apartheid&#8221;.  Look at the basket case South Africa is today.  These &#8220;war veterans&#8221; that are causing all the trouble were not even born when apartheid was in place; they take pride in running white South Africans off their land and destroying the farms.  As they have no knowledge of modern farming techniques, the land is wasted.  South Africa (and the other &#8220;black ruled&#8221; countries, Zimbabwe etc.) have become net importers of foodstuffs because the &#8220;brains&#8221; of the operation have been forced to leave the country.  Where are those who protested apartheid now?</p>

<p>Of course they will scream &#8220;racism&#8221; as loudly as ever. However cameras in the classroom will be able to prove to parents that their little Shaniqua or DeShawn was actually misbehaving in class. The next thing that would happen would be that the camera itself would be called racist.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the low g-loaded mayor of LA, VillaLaRaza.  Newsom and O&rsquo;Connell are the correct color politically (red) but sport the wrong skin color to run for governor of the neo-Marxist state of California. <br>
  <br>
I believe VillaLaRaza&rsquo;s handlers will push him toward the ultimate goal:  The US Presidency  &mdash;  first LA, then California, then D.C. </p>
<p>Is it any wonder productive Whites and their businesses are continuing to flee California?</p>
<p>And what are the knuckleheads in Sacramento up to these days?</p>
<p>In the midst of a recession, with the highest gas tax in the nation, highest business taxes in the West, highest corporate tax rate, highest individual income tax rate in the nation  &mdash;  a state that coddles, encourages and pays cradle-to-grave for massive numbers of illegal immigrants, the Communists are proposing even MORE MASSIVE TAXES.</p>
<p>I will probably be the last White Californian to flee the state  &mdash;  and I don&rsquo;t plan to turn the lights off as there won&rsquo;t be any lights left to turn off when the electrical grid goes the way of Eskom.</p>

			<p>Non white students have to have teacher &#8220;who are like them&#8221;</p>
<p>That is why the people in the immigration restriction movement, and others,are trying hard to stop this injustice and make non-white students stay in the countries they are comfortable in that have teachers who look like them. Less tension here in the U.S. for European Americans and less stress for the non-white students. It&rsquo;s a WIN WIN, solution.</p>
