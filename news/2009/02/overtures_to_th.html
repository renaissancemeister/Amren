<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a town where networking has been developed to a fine art, black Washington is clamoring for the Obamas. The election of the first black president is seen by many African Americans as their chance to finally sit at the table. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas (D-Ward 5) said he sent a letter to Obama on Friday asking him to play in a golf tournament June 5 to 9 at Langston Legacy Golf Course, which was chartered by Congress 70 years ago to provide blacks a place to play.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s one of the first big-city presidents, so he understands the urban environment, which I represent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The connection between him and communities like mine is great.&nbsp;.&nsbp;.&nbsp;. He&rsquo;s one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Since they are African American and Washington, D.C., is a predominantly black city, there are a host of black churches,&#8221; he [Anthony Hawkins, administrator of Metropolitan A.M.E. Church in Northwest Washington] said. &#8220;It would be a feather in one&rsquo;s cap to have them worshiping with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The very presence of the Obamas is a breath of fresh air for the civic life of black D.C.,&#8221; Dyson added. &#8220;He was a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, spent 20 years in an identifiably black church and cut his teeth on black civic [involvement].&#8221;</p>
<p>Dyson added that a natural outcome of Obama&rsquo;s involvement in the black community would be that blacks in Washington would &#8220;seek to further nurture and engage&#8221; him and his family.</p>
<p>For African American professionals, the connection extends further. The president is a well-educated black man married to a well-educated black woman, both working to raise two children while holding demanding jobs.</p>
<p>Charisse Carney-Nunes, 41, a co-founder of Sistermoms, a D.C.-based support group for African American mothers and their families, said she had planned to reach out to Michelle Obama when her husband was elected to the U.S. Senate. But Michelle Obama and the children did not relocate to Washington. Now, she said, she wants to offer her a chance to bond with other local black mothers.</p>
<p>Carney-Nunes, the mother of two children and author of the children&rsquo;s book &#8220;I Am Barack Obama,&#8221; which tries to inspire children through Obama&rsquo;s success, said the organization&rsquo;s leadership is planning to invite the first lady to its annual Mother&rsquo;s Day tea.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why this article is so long.  All it seems to say is that Barack and Michelle Obama are black, and so are most of D.C.&rsquo;s residents.  And?</p>

<p>This just gets more and more laughable!</p>
<p>And if the &#8220;Obamas&#8221; have their way, the so-called African Americans will all be sitting exactly where they belong, at the kiddie-tables. What makes these arrogantly ignorant blacks even remotely think, that they want anything to do with them? They have provided their votes and money, as were available; they have nothing else to offer at this point.</p>
<p>Well, that is, unless the &#8220;Obamas&#8221; want to be tarnished through guilt by association by 88% of the country, for the sake of 12% of it?</p>
<p>As always, blacks cannot and will not, ever learn!</p>

<p>Does anyone (black or white) seriously think the Obamas are going to &#8220;bond&#8221; with poor people?</p>

			<p>And when the black messiah fails to participate, what then? Will they call him racist? A sell out to his white handlers? </p>
<p>The President works for us, I dont think he has time for a 4 day golf tournament. I certainly dont! </p>

<p>Whites are always doing stuff like this to help blacks. It makes me sick. Will blacks in Zimbabwe build stuff for Whites? Of course not. Whites are the only race of people in the history of the world who actually feel guilt for defeating people or enslaving people. And where has this guilt gotten us? Nothing. In my opinion about 75% of Whites in this country are incapable of standing up to non-whites or incapable of being so honest that it borders on meanness. This country is doomed.</p>

			<p>Do they really think that BHO is going to go out clubbing with them? They must think the Presidency is a nine-to-five job.</p>
<p>Not to mention the possibility, even the propensity for violence at most nightclubs these days. Can you see the Secret Service trying to secure one of those places?</p>

<p>Surely they are mistaken? My liberal friends have informed me, very forcefully, that Obama&rsquo;s election has <i>nothing</i> to do with race at all, that 95% of black voters voted for him is&hellip;well, actually they&rsquo;ve never managed to explain that bit in a convincing non-racist manner. Anyhow, he just happens to be black, so why on earth should all these other people who also just happen to be black think that he should associate with them? What are they, racists?</p>

			<p>This is a good example of the simplistic thinking of many, perhaps most Blacks. They see Obama as &#8220;their guy.&#8221; As one of them, who will naturally be eager to rub elbows with all his urban brethren. Alas, this is complete, though entirely typical Black foolishness. Moreover, in so many, many ways, Obama is no more one of them than the man in the moon! The only real urban(read - Ghetto_ experience Obama has is on the periphery as a crusader, as a half-White, White educated &#8220;community organizer.&#8221; </p>
<p>Enough already - stop pretending he represents Black anything. Obama is an example of one who has escaped, or indeed altogether avoided Black culture for most of his life. He would never be where he is were it otherwise!   </p>

			<p>When Obama is in Chicago he goes to the best restaurants, is a member of Chicago&rsquo;s most exclusive health club, sends his kids to private school and lives in one of the whitest areas in town.</p>
<p>He is black only when it suits him.</p>

Good question!   That term, &#8220;First Lady&#8221; has always annoyed me.  To my knowldge, there is no such thing as &#8220;First Lady&#8221;.  The title is a creation of the media.  From it, we even get First Families, First Children, even nonsense such as  First Dog!    </p>
<p>She is simply Mrs. Obama, the wife of the President. She holds no official position in the government, elected or appointed. There is no such  title, and there is no such &#8220;job&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, that may be true, but what is unnerving is the fact that she is really an &#8220;advisor&#8221; to the President with no official accountability (not that the official ones have much either these days). The first person someone sees in the morning and the last to see them at night holds powerful sway over them.</p>
<p>Based on the content of her college thesis and her candid remarks during the campaign (prior to being kept out the spotlight for the latter portion) she&rsquo;s appears to have quite the chip on her shoulder, and the ear of the President as well.</p>
<p>Not a pleasant notion if you really think about it, considering her general contempt for America and more specific loathing of whites (highly likely).<br>

<p>That IS upsetting.  Seems that she&rsquo;s just continuing the tradition of Hilary.  And of others going back at least to Eleanor Roosevelt. Something should be done about these unelected, unaccountable busybodies. (And wasn&rsquo;t Wilson&rsquo;s wife actually running the government when he was ill?)<br>

			<p>Perhaps the Obamas can dine at Cluck-U-Chicken in Seabrook, MD, in the heart of affluent, majority-black Prince George&rsquo;s County.  It would be a shot in the arm for that county full of Obamaniacs.  Maybe President Obama can show the fine people of PG County how to tip and to treat the wait-staff with kindness, rather than with rudeness.</p>

			<p>I want to know, how does Michelle Obama treat the White house staff?  I always consider the way a person treats their subordinates a clear mark of the person behind the mask.  Hilary Clinton, of course, was notoriously nasty to the help.  The normally discreet servants paid her back by blabbing.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll be soon hearing whispers from the linen cabinets and the kitchen about a petty Reign of Terror.  Bad character always shines through.</p>
