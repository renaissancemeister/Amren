			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, February 04, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A snapshot of [Miley] Cyrus, 16, best known as the star of the Disney Channel show &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221;, and friends posing with an Asian friend and pulling their eyes sideways surfaced on the Internet this week.</p>
<p>The OCA [Organization of Chinese Americans], a national organization in the United States dedicated to advancing the social and political welfare of Asian Pacific Americans, called on the singer-actress to apologize.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only has Miley Cyrus and the other individuals in the photograph encouraged and legitimized the taunting and mocking of people of Asian descent, she has also insulted her many Asian Pacific American friends,&#8221; OCA executive director George Wu in a statement issued on Monday.</p>
<p>Wu said the fact that an Asian friend was included in the photo &#8220;does not make it acceptable.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Gimme a break! Is there anything a White person can do&hellip; that does NOT OFFEND some damned minority? Speaking of which, I have yet to see minorities worry about offending White people&hellip; which they do. Which they do!</p>

			<p>from the article: Wu said the fact that an Asian friend was included in the photo &ldquo;does not make it acceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it can be surmised that there was no ill intent amongst the group having their Asian friend included in the picture for he does not look upset in the least. Wu has no idea what the context of the picture was so he is wrong to jump to his negative conclusions. The Organization of Chinese Americans needs to lighten up. </p>

			<p>This is ridiculous.  Nobody cares when other races bash whites, and in rap music for instance they do much worse than this.  Why can there be an &#8220;OCA&#8221; for Chinese people but nothing for white Americans?  I wish Miley would tell the OCA where they can put their opinion but unfortunately she&rsquo;ll probably apologize.  We must not offend the Tolerant Ones and risk facing their wrath.</p>

			<p>It looks more to me like they really like their Asian friend, and they are making slant eyes not to mock him but to say we feel comfortable enough around you to tease you.  I&rsquo;m sure their Asian friend teases them about their &#8216;whiteness&rsquo; too.</p>

			<p>Most Asian people don&rsquo;t mind you teasing them. It&rsquo;s only when it is deliberately and ignorantly done to offend the person that they would get mad. This picture clearly demonstrates the former.</p>
<p>This organization needs to realize this and keep their mouth shut instead of making Asians seem like just another whinning minority group.</p>

			<p>Do Asians have slanted eyes? Yes. Seems more like insecurity on their part rather than racism on Miley&rsquo;s.</p>

			<p>I wonder what their asian friend thought of it.<br>
Within a close circle of friends,and behind closed doors <br>
anything is possible.They only have to answer to the press because<br>
it was published to the world.Right or wrong? Does it matter?<br>
I am not always virtuous in front of my good friends.</p>

			<p>She&rsquo;s just a teenage girl innocently clowning around with her teenage friends, one of whom appears to be oriental.  If she was a drug addict lesbian then she would have the sympathy of the left. Her only crime appears to be being a White teenager who, as far as anyone really knows, isn&rsquo;t in to the general degenerate pathologies of our society.  And, of course Mickey Mouse pays her millions of dollars a year to wear a blond wig and pretend to sing to preteens.  I think all George Wu really wants is a topless picture of Miley.  Hey George, they don&rsquo;t exist.  It&rsquo;s all internet rumors.  Stop follow little girls around and go back to extorting money from corporations.</p>

			<p> Things like this are the reason I no longer bother to<br>
befriend non-Whites anymore. I don&rsquo;t have time for all<br>
of the childish games over what&rsquo;s racist.</p>

			<p>Why can&rsquo;t they just blow it off?  We whites take guff from non-whites and for the most part we blow it off.</p>

			<p>What makes me lose any sympathy I might have for these organizations of foreign Chinese is the racism I&rsquo;m subjected to each time I visit Asia. This sort of thing pales in comparison. The funny thing is a lot of Chinese I know in western countries still carry their Chinese nationalism with them, so it is often less about racism and more about their nationalistic pride - the same people would play down the racism foreigners experience in China, for instance, because they cannot accept any criticism of the &#8220;motherland&#8221;. I do envy them in a way though - they can show as much nationalistic pride as they want and their fellow countrymen won&rsquo;t shoot them down for it.</p>

			<p>The Asian in the picture is purposefully opening his eyes large in the picture so he looks like apologize. Why isn&rsquo;t Wu calling for him to apologize?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m surprised by this reaction. I lived in Japan for a long time and had friends from China, Korea, Japan&hellip;.  If anything, I always found them to be able to take the heat the best.</p>
<p>I guess its just a sign of how people who move to America get on that victim band wagon.</p>
<p>I would hope that this outburst from rinky dinky organization doesn&rsquo;t change anyone&rsquo;s view of Orientals.  </p>

			<p>The Yellow race is now the &#8221; new &#8221; black and brown races; pile on against Whitey who allowed you &#8221; paradise &#8221; when contrasted to their own third-world hell-hole; such appreciation by these diversity bigots. This Chinese organization ; does it fight anti-White hiring practices in most Chinese-American restaurants throughout our country ? Now that is racial bias on an much larger and also economic scale. That is right, Whites are the victim here ; no problem.</p>

			<p>Most of the Asians I know could care less about this, they are too busy, getting and education, raising a familiy, paying their taxes, running a business, taking care of their homes and yards. NO ONE wants to be degraded but few Asians would take the time out of their busy and productive day to worry about what a 16 year old girl and her multicultered friends are doing when they are acting silly.</p>

			<p>Okay, so members of the OCA are offended by this playful snapshot. I&rsquo;m offended by the fact that a race-based group such as the OCA even exists and is presented as perfectly legitimate. An organization devoted to advancing the interests of MY race would be excoriated. </p>

			<p>Do Asians have eyes that look different from ours?  As it just so happens, they do.  Why is this important to anyone?  Don&rsquo;t the alleged adults at OCA have anything better to do than get worked up over what a 16 year-old ACTRESS does?<br>

<p>I agree. I have worked closely with Asian people and find them fun loving and tolerant in most cases. I have never been treated ill by them and have teased them and been teased by them all in fun. Fine people I think and not all of them want to come to America like the blacks and hispanics do.</p>

			<p>I am Korean and my eyes are relatively less slanted than other Asians, but there is nothing offending about someone telling me or Asians &#8220;you have slanted eyes and other Asians tend to have slanted eyes&#8221; <br>

			<p>Nobody likes a good racist joke about the Chinese better than a Chinese person, usually because he can always think of some province (not his) where the people actually do behave in some stereotypical fashion. It seems only American born Asians are likely to take offense at ethnic jokes. Usually, it&rsquo;s because they learned at college that they are supposed to take offense. On the other hand maybe it&rsquo;s the fluoride in the water.</p>

			<p>There was a case in Mobile, Alabama recently where a black female was trying to sue a white man who &#8220;looked at her funny&#8221; when he was walking in the opposite direction across a four lane street.</p>
<p>Apparently that case and this photo shows just how far this country has gone with this business of offending people. All minorities, including Asians, are now becoming hyper sensitive about anything and everything!</p>
<p>Ever wonder how the Chinese, Koreans, and especially the Japanese actually view white Americans?</p>

			<p>And how exactly does this differ from any other good-natured playful teasing that occurs amongst friends, and centers often around distinct attributes, peculiarities or amusing flaws?</p>
<p>Pfft, this picture was probably preceeded and proceeded with laughter from its participants   &mdash;   all of them   &mdash;   and the only people who are offended are apparently the nitwits at the OCA.</p>

			<p>Any white person who has ever lived in an Asian country can tell you that the size of the Westerner&rsquo;s nose, shape of our eyes, amount of body hair, and (in some cases)excessive weight is a constant source of amusement to them. It&rsquo;s just something you have to learn to live with. </p>
