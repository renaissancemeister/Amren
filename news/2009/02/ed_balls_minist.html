			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Hope, Telegraph (London), February 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The economic crisis could spark a resurgence in the Far Right, a close ally of Gordon Brown has suggested.</p>
<p>Ed Balls, the Children&rsquo;s and Schools Secretary, said the downturn was likely to be the most serious for 100 years, and his comments appeared to raise the prospect of a return to the Far Right politics of the 1930s and the rise of Facism.</p>
<p>His warning, in a speech to activists at the weekend, came after a trade union baron warned that far right parties were trying to hijack the campaign for &#8220;British jobs for British workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The row over foreign workers has gathered momentum in recent weeks and Mr Balls seemed to suggest the recession could trigger a return to the Far Right politics that prospered in the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>
<p>He told Labour&rsquo;s Yorkshire conference: &#8220;The economy is going to define our politics in this region and in Britain in the next year, the next five years, the next 10 and even the next 15 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that this is a financial crisis more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s and we all remember how the politics of that era were shaped by the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remarks are significant because Mr Balls was a key adviser to Mr Brown during his decade at the Treasury as Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>Mr Balls said that he believed this to be &#8220;the most serious global recession for over 100 years&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We now are seeing the realities of globalisation, though at a speed, pace and ferocity which none of us have seen before. The reality is that this is becoming the most serious global recession for, I&rsquo;m sure, over 100 years as it will turn out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week Derek Simpson, the general secretary of Unite, gave warning that far right elements were hijacking a campaign against foreign firms bringing in non-British workers.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We are deeply concerned that other organisations like the BNP are latching onto the movement for their own racist agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night, George Osborne, the shadow Chancellor, said Mr Balls&rsquo; comments were at odds with Treasury forecasts suggesting a recovery in the third quarter this year.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;This is a staggering and very worrying admission from a Cabinet Minister and Gordon Brown&rsquo;s closest ally in the Treasury over the past ten years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are being told that not only we are facing the worst recession in 100 years, but that it will last for over a decade  &mdash;  far longer than Treasury forecasts predict.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this time of recession, a Cabinet rift over the economy could be deeply damaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need immediate clarification of whether Ed Balls is speaking for his colleagues in the Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats compared the comments with those made by Treasury minister Baroness Vadera, when she claimed she was seeing &#8220;green shoots&#8221; of economic recovery, echoing remarks by former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont in 1991.</p>
<p>She was criticised for saying last month: &#8220;I am seeing a few green shoots, but it&rsquo;s a little bit too early to say exactly how they&rsquo;d grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent Cable, the LibDems&rsquo; Treasury spokesman, said: &#8220;Instead of giving clear and consistent leadership, government ministers are oscillating between complacent optimism and this doom laden picture of Armageddon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely the truth lies between the two? This is a serious crisis but not hopeless.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news came as the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, warned that the UK was at risk of a deeper-than-expected recession.</p>
<p>The authority said that the worst financial meltdown &#8220;in more than 70 years&#8221; has far from run its course and the British economy was predicted to shrink by 2.2 per cent this year.</p>
<p>It also said that Britain&rsquo;s &#8216;vulnerable&rsquo; banks need to make huge culture changes to survive the recession.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ed Balls denied he had been trying to draw parallels with the Far Right.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The speech was about the difference between Labour and the Tories on the economy. It was not about trying to draw parallels with the Far Right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories are completely isolated in their opposition to a fiscal stimulus that is essential to combating what most economists agree is an unprecedented financial sector recession. &#8220;He said that this difference between the parties will define this country&rsquo;s politics for many years to come.&#8221;</p>

			<p>In Europe, like America, the left has a symbiotic relationship with immigration.  The left needs loyal voters and immigrants need money and liberal immigration laws.  In every country in Europe every immigrant political party is left of center.  When pressed about this unholy alliance all the left can do is throw mudd which means cry racism.  Other than that they have got nothing.  </p>

			<p>Since the right is forced not to use race as an issue they are forced to use logical arguements such as employment, crime, and the environment as issues.  The left seems to have nothing but hot air and race baiting.  </p>

			<p>Ministers are right to fear the rise of race-conscious parties around the World: people may be complacent about the the abuse and undermining of their societies when economic times are going good (the modern world&rsquo;s bread and circuses), but when these distractions dry up they will start to think more independently and expect more from their governments. MPs&rsquo; words and persistent warnings about a so-called far-right renaissance, only a few months into the crisis, betray an unspoken realisation that it&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to get away with what they have been doing anymore.</p>
<p>This economic crisis is dreadful as it has already put millions of people out of work and will cause much more misery for years to come; yet out of this great evil, surely some good must come, and I would be lying if I said that part of me wasn&rsquo;t very happy indeed that it has happened. I had always thought that our struggle would take decades, and entail much persecution of ourselves by the establishment. However, the fact that the &#8216;world consensus&rsquo; according to bankers and capitalism - and the style of government which has gone hand in and with this - has been so badly shaken already, and looks to be discredited yet further, should accelerate the development of our movement considerably.</p>
<p>In his &#8216;Why Race Matters&rsquo; piece for AR, Sam Francis mentions an ancient Chinese curse - &#8216;May you live in interesting times&rsquo;. If only he could have known just how interesting they would turn out to be!</p>

<p>As a far left kook, he should fear the right, because the further we get into this depression the stronger nationalism will get, and I&rsquo;m seriously expecting the old heave ho in a couple of years for the muslim terrorists there who are preaching anti-Christian hate in their mosques, and are creating home-grown terrorists.  The right won&rsquo;t put up with their sedition as the mentally challenged far left kooks do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very likely that when this character&rsquo;s nation is well into nationalism and he openly advocates importing terrorists he&rsquo;ll be picking his teeth up off the ground every time he opens his despicable mouth.</p>

			<p>  It would seem that Ed Balls is fearful of losing his once the people figure him out. Labour is the communist party of the U.K. The far right is the only hope for the U.K. God save the B.N.P.</p>

			<p>Funny when the lefties refer to the Far right .What they mean are white people doing what is in their own best interest. But  when Muslims and blacks do the same thing its always in the interest of equality and civil rights.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t want the white British electorate voting a party in that actually <i>cares</i> about the indigenous population, would we?</p>
<p><i>His warning, in a speech to activists at the weekend, came after a trade union baron warned that far right parties were trying to hijack the campaign for &ldquo;British jobs for British workers&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>The British National Party <a href="https://bnp.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">has repeatedly exposed these &#8220;labour union&#8221; bigwigs - and their Liberal/Labour/Conservative etc allies</a> for <i>still</i> campaigning for &#8220;foreign workers&#8221; while both <i>supporting the &#8220;British Jobs for British Workers</i> campaign and <i>Britain experiences the worst recession in decades</i>.</p>
<p>Claiming them as &#8220;hijacking&#8221; this movement is the same line a corrupt CEO running a company into the ground to line his own pockets calls the movement to replace him.</p>
<p><i>He told Labour&rsquo;s Yorkshire conference: &ldquo;The economy is going to define our politics in this region and in Britain in the next year, the next five years, the next 10 and even the next 15 years.</i></p>
<p>Either Britain will leave this recession with an unshakeable indigenous white majority, or it will leave with an impoverished, brown-skinned underclass ruled by fanatical mullahs from the Middle East - it&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p><i>Last week Derek Simpson, the general secretary of Unite, gave warning that far right elements were hijacking a campaign against foreign firms bringing in non-British workers.</i></p>
<p>The same &#8220;Unite&#8221; negotiating the wages of foreign workers?</p>
<p>But yes, this global recession will be a <i>lot</i> worse than the &#8220;higher-ups&#8221; are claiming:<br>
For an example, can you remember when they said that the U.S. &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t in a recession&#8221;, then a few weeks later said that the &#8220;U.S. had been in a recession for the last six months&#8221;?</p>

			<p>I was just watching Sci Fi movie set in the UK &#8216;Children of Men&rsquo;. I can&rsquo;t say it was a good movie, but there was certainly &#8216;fascism&rsquo;. In the directors comments after the movie he says something about the &#8216;infantilism&rsquo; of a &#8216;hippie&rsquo; in the movie, &#8220;that&rsquo;s when the decadence started, the 60&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t it?&#8221; he says, something like that. </p>

All of what you&rsquo;ve said about the Left is true.  </p>
<p>But, for the most part, so is it true of the &#8220;Right&#8221;.  At least the economic right, that is, though not the racial right   &mdash;   which everyone in the media and the public arena deplores as beyond the pale. The racial right are viewed as political lepers whom all &#8220;legitimate&#8221;  politicians want to avoid like the plague.</p>
<p>Except for some quibbling about the role of capitalism, taxation, minimum wages (in other words, money) there is little if any difference between them at the bottom line. They are all anti-racist and pro-immigration. They are all pro-assimilationist One Worlders. They are all disastrous for us.</p>

<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that just awful?    What an outrage!  <br>
British jobs for British workers???  Leave it to those looney  &#8220;fascists&#8221; to come up with such a preposterous notion.</p>

			<p>Already in the UK, some Labour and Liberal councillors have changed Parties to join the BNP at local election levels but this could be a result of finding out just how many of the voters are going to vote for the BNP, so they wish to keep their soft bureaucratic jobs.  Being a councillor once meant you only received minimum expenses, not a salary and pension.  You were literally a pillar of society and  successful in a local business.  But this does not fit the profile of an average Labour candidate who is more likly to be a career politician.  After all, who wants to really work for a living?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mr Balls said that he believed this to be &ldquo;the most serious global recession for over 100 years&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cut to the chase Balls:  If the economic downturn is the most serious in 100 years, then by definition it is much more than a mere &#8220;recession&#8221;.  Call it what is is - a depression.  The overleveraging of the credit markets has brought this day of reckoning.  Britain&rsquo;s condition today is arguable worse than that of the US, which is bad enough.  Frankly Britain is flat broke and the pound is kaput.  We can only hope that this downturn will bring about a resurgence of the true British right, i.e. indigenous Brits who care about their country, people and culture.  The death of multicultural globalism is long overdue.</p>
