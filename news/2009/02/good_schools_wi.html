<h1>Good Schools Will Be Forced to Take in Excluded [Expelled] Black Pupils Under New Government Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, February 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State schools across England will be forced to share out between themselves badly behaved black pupils who have been excluded [expelled] from other schools, according to new government plans.</p>
<p>Every year 1,420 pupils in London are permanently excluded and nearly 53,780 are suspended for a fixed period. Of this figure, at least eighty percent are black boys, according to government figures.</p>
<p>Black children are on average three times more likely than white pupils to face permanent exclusion, according to figures published by a Department for Education report three years ago.</p>
<p>Now schools will be obligated to &#8220;admit an unruly child for every one they expel as part of a &#8220;one out, one in&#8221; policy. The proposals apply to every state school in England.</p>
<p>Under the government&rsquo;s Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill published on Friday, all state schools will be forced to join so-called Behaviour Partnerships.</p>
<p>Only failing schools placed in &#8220;special measures&#8221; by Ofsted will be exempt from taking in more pupils expelled from elsewhere. Proposed legislation also extends schools&rsquo; powers to search for alcohol, drugs and stolen items. They can already frisk pupils for weapons.</p>
<p>Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson has claimed that schools &#8220;are excluding too many pupils.&#8221; Speaking at the &#8220;London Schools and the Black Child conference&#8221; (if someone organised a &#8220;White Child conference&#8221; they would be dismissed as &#8220;racist&#8221;) Mr Johnson said, &#8220;Too many children in schools in London are lacking drive and ambition, which in turn leads to poor academic results, high truancy rates and ultimately, exclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Ofsted report in 1999 showed that Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean and gypsy children were also failing to make adequate progress  &mdash;  although, as always, &#8220;racism&#8221; from white teachers was blamed as the cause.<br>

			<p><i>State schools across England will be forced to share out between themselves badly behaved black pupils who have been excluded [expelled] from other schools, according to new government plans.</i></p>
<p>The best course of action is to carefully assess each student&rsquo;s propensity for serious misbehavior and isolate them <b>before</b> they have a chance to assault, rape, murder, steal, and/or destroy. An even better course of action is to repatriate Blacks to Africa, Indians to India, Muslims to Arabia, Hispanics to Latrin America, and Asians to Asia. Thereafter, if Whites are caught misbehaving, send them to reform school.</p>
<p>The central point is that multiculturalism always fails. Diversity only serves to demoralize all facets of society. There are no excpetions that have been shown, empirically or anecdotally. Even the most devout Liberals, such as Robert Putnam, have acknowledged as much.</p>
<p>Of course, these facts lead logical minds to conclude that governments want citizens, including those of the same race (as Putnam found), to become increasingly distrustful of each other. That ensures less opposition to governments. </p>
<p>It is quite obvious that Western governments are systematically conspiring to diminish the presence of Whites.</p>

According to wikipedia, England is 4.3% black (including mixed).  So how can blacks be <b>only</b> 3 times as likely as whites to be suspended when 80% of suspensions are black?  Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that 26% of England&rsquo;s state school kids would have to black in a country that is lass than 5% black?  Is that possible?    </p>

			<p>Not like the BNP doesn&rsquo;t already realize it, or that we here don&rsquo;t realize it, but there&rsquo;s a reason why these good schools are good, precisely because of their lack of black students.  They won&rsquo;t be good for much longer.</p>

<p>Now is the time to start kicking these black &#8216;boys&rsquo; out of England.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Any school that kicks out a student must take in one kicked out by some other school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually that seems like a good idea. Probably the way it&rsquo;s often done. It&rsquo;s a pretty white way of doing things. </p>
<p>I do wonder if this whole thing is about getting us to ignore white students who aren&rsquo;t doing well. And to also ignore the dumbing down at the top. The inadequacy of the top students. </p>

			<p>The British National Party is unquestionably the last sane political party in the UK.  Small wonder then the powers that be over there are trying to destroy it.</p>
<p>This article raises an issue I&rsquo;ve talked about (fruitlessly) for years.  It&rsquo;s not blacks (or other assorted low-IQ non-Whites) that are destroying Western societies.  Decades of standardized IQ tests clearly show that, left to their own devices, most blacks don&rsquo;t possess the IQ to build a banana split.  It&rsquo;s White race-traitors and an Asiatic element that have infested the halls of powers in Western societies responsible for this madness.</p>
<p>Any Whites today with children would do well to seriously look at home-schooling rather than leave their children to the public fool system.</p>

<p>Black children find themselves overrepresented in negative areas and underrepresented in positive areas everywhere in the world - from Europe to the Americas to the Middle East&hellip;except it&rsquo;s always the <i>societies</i> fault, <b>not</b> that of the blacks.</p>
<p><i>Now schools will be obligated to &ldquo;admit an unruly child for every one they expel as part of a &ldquo;one out, one in&rdquo; policy. The proposals apply to every state school in England.</i></p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll just shunt them around ad infinitum?</p>

			<p>At least now the benefits of &#8220;diversity&#8221; will be shared more equitably throughout England.  Some of my most liberal aquaintances here in the states would have benefited from this policy - many of whome having been educated only among whites and asians.</p>

<p>Then why bother kicking out a bad/violent/racist student if he is a member of a privileged race? The specimen you get in return may well be worse. The devil you know and all that &hellip;</p>

			<p>Boris sometimes sounds like a ninny but he&rsquo;s a vast improvement on Red Ken, the man who never met a terrorist he didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>White racism is selective in its effects: Hindu children and Chinese children actually [on average] do better at school in Britain than do the majority [white] community&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>We can argue that this is due to innate IQ, but my guess is the following:</p>
<p>1 - Young Hindus and Chinese, like Jews and - still - most young white Brits, have stable home lives and steady parental affection and guidance.</p>
<p>2 - Successful kids have good self-motivation and self-expectation and [ideally] positive peer pressure. If a kid is sneered at for reading, s/he will get the message fast. Equally, if s/he is jeered at for reading badly or not at all, s/he will learn to read fast enough.</p>
<p>3 - Teacher quality is less important than the two points above<br>
but still important; this might be called &#8216;teacher expectation&rsquo; and/or &#8216;community expectation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I went to the sort of provincial primary in the U.K. where we recited the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, sang and hymn and chanted all the times tables up to 12 x 12 = 144. Every morning.<br>
We learned some stuff by rote: <br>
&#8220;The parallels of latitude run parallel to the equator whereas the meridians of longitude converge at the poles&#8221; - this was just before my tenth birthday, I recall. We had to learn how to explain the meaning of stuff like this, too.<br>
There were precisely two black children in the school, both from Black British middle-class families of the hospital doctor-and-nurse class and both black pupils were academically in the upper 25% of the school.<br>
Unlike some contributors, I do not believe that blacks are innately dumb. On the other hand, we can argue that contemporary &#8216;black culture&rsquo; - hideous songs about playahs and pimps and Uzis - could have been expressly designed to maker blacks dumb and keep them backward.</p>

			<p>It will not be along, I assure you, till liberals and minorities begin to demand this sort of nonsense within our own, already troubled, schools. </p>
<p>I can only hope that home schooling and private schools will continue to be bastions of White culture. </p>

<p>This report is fro London where the black population is between 12-15%.</p>

<p>The figure is for exclusions from London schools not schools in England as a whole.</p>

			<p>What?  Only one White student is getting expelled for every three Black students?  Racism!</p>
<p>Next thing you know, the Marxist engineers are going to force schools to expel at least three White students at a time so that they can create their multi-cultural utopia all across England.</p>

			<p>Why not just put them into borstals and solve the problem that way? It&rsquo;s the liberal hand wringers who have decided that nobody under the age of 16 is &#8216;responsible for their actions&rsquo;, in spite of the fact that everybody knows this is rubbish. Start charging 10 year olds with assault, threatening behaviour, and whatever else they do to ruin the lives of other children around them, and put them away for years in borstals, and the problem is solved.<br>
Obviously our unelected rulers won&rsquo;t do anything about it, because they want there to be endless problems in our societies. Divide and conquer&hellip;</p>

			<p>I wonder if the dopes who developed this policy realize that the shuffling of major disciplinary cases around instead of genuine expulsions completely defeats the point of discipline in the affected schools.</p>
