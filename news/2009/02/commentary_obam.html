<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Press Office Needs Diversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roland S. Martin, CNN, February 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I got an e-mail Tuesday listing all of the various press folks and contact information, and hardly any African-Americans or Hispanics were listed. Granted, the deputy press secretary is African-American and the director of broadcast media is Hispanic. That&rsquo;s not sufficient.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this shouldn&rsquo;t come as a shock, because the campaign press staff of then-Sen. Barack Obama was just as weak on diversity.</p>
<p>Just because there is a black president doesn&rsquo;t mean that issues like diversity should be cast aside. President Obama should be held to the same standard when it comes to this issue as any other occupier of that office. I am a former national board member of the National Association of Black Journalists, and my support for diversity never wavers, no matter who is running the show.</p>
<p>One of the reasons this is important is because just like in the media, where there are bigger and better things awaiting the White House correspondent, a position in the White House press office positions someone for the next level.</p>
<p>When the press secretary leaves, the president normally chooses the next one from those ranks. We&rsquo;ve never seen a black or Hispanic press secretary standing at the podium each day giving daily briefings, and when there are none on the bench, well, that streak will continue.</p>
<p>Looking at the roster of other offices, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s even one African-American or Hispanic who is the primary spokesman or number two at any of the major departments, such as Treasury, State, and Justice.</p>
<p>These coveted positions often lead to the top jobs in communications firms in Washington and around the country, and even junior staffers now are tapped for senior jobs in the next administration (Look at how many junior staffers on President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s team are now senior staffers for President Barack Obama).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The election of President Barack Obama means that one barrier, albeit a major one, has been torn down. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that others don&rsquo;t need to come tumbling down as well. For those groups that have often been marginalized, it&rsquo;s important to have the doors of opportunity opened.</p>
<p>If diversity truly matters, then it must be emphasized and realized top down. The company leaders in corporate diversity got there because the CEO made it clear that it mattered, and they demanded their underlings make it a reality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If change is truly what this president wants to bring to bear, let&rsquo;s see change across the board. He should make it clear that the clubby atmosphere in Washington of hire-who-you-know has gone out the window, and that window has been opened up for the next generation of talented individuals. The power positions matter a lot in the nation&rsquo;s capital, and when you have a seat at the table, that&rsquo;s what counts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that not all hiring has been completed in the White House press office and in other areas. OK, fine. But the A-team has clearly been hired, and that means anyone else coming in the door is on the B-team. And that just won&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The election of President Barack Obama means that one barrier, albeit a major one, has been torn down.&#8221;</p>
<p>What?  So a Black now occupies the most exclusive office in the world, but that isn&rsquo;t enough  &mdash;  they skipped over all the other positions lower than that in the process.  Yes, we have a Black president, but why hasn&rsquo;t there ever been a Black vice president?  Racism!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for giving undeserving Blacks every position in the Cabinet and let the world see how truly incompetent they are at running this country.  Talk about a comedy of errors that would be better than Hollywood could dream up.  I never watch T.V., but I&rsquo;d have it on 24/7 if our country were run at the highest levels by only Blacks.  Now that&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>

			<p>Of course, the issue of whether any blacks are even qualified to fill any of these positions never enters into the equation.  For Roland, it&rsquo;s simply a quotas game   &mdash;   qualifications, talent and experience be damned.  After all, it&rsquo;s worked for Roland.  One just has to listen to the incoherent and belligerent nonsense that spews out of his mouth for two seconds to realize the only reason CNN has him on the air is because he&rsquo;s black.</p>

			<p>I propose that all whites who are in journalism, people who write blogs, and whites in general conversation, should start substituting the word diversity, wherever it is used for non-whites. </p>
<p>For example: job opening at X corporation, apply tday, we believe in a non-white(instead of diverse) work force.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny but I hear blacks complain just as much about the same intractable problems when they get their people into office or positions of influence.</p>
<p>Having blacks in power doesn&rsquo;t seem to change anything in the black community for the better.<br>

			<p><i> I am a former national board member of the <b>National Association of Black Journalists</b>, and my support for <b>diversity</b> never wavers, no matter who is running the show.</i></p>
<p>I believe fellow American Renaissance reader sbuffalonative sums this blatant hypocrisy best with his succinct <b>Black Golden Rule</b>:<br>
<i>* That which is white must be made black</i><br>
<i>* That which is black must be kept black</i></p>
<p><i>Looking at the roster of other offices, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s even one African-American or Hispanic who is the primary spokesman or number two at any of the major departments, such as Treasury, State, and Justice.</i></p>
<p>The white liberals that insisted on &#8220;diversifying the American population&#8221; by massive non-white immigration are in for a rude shock in the next 4 years, as they are &#8220;diversified&#8221; out of employment.</p>
<p><i>If diversity truly matters, then it must be emphasized and realized top down. The company leaders in corporate diversity got there <b>because the CEO made it clear that it mattered, and they demanded their underlings make it a reality</b>.</i></p>
<p>And yet again, a black person subtly admits that <b>&#8220;diversity&#8221; and meritocracy are largely mutually exclusive</b> - the same reason why you&rsquo;ll rarely see 60+ year old athletes compared to their percentage of the population, black golfers compared to their percentage of the population etc.<br>
But the greater question here is <b>what&rsquo;s so good about &#8220;diversity&#8221;, or enforcing it?</b></p>
<p>If the Chinese invaded the U.S. and your company was fighting a similiar-sized Chinese one would you rather be serving under the Chinese commander that clawed his way to his current position, or a female/Hispanic/black commander that had been promoted as there &#8220;were&rsquo;nt enough officers with &#8216;different plumbing&rsquo;/brown faces/black faces&#8221;?</p>
<p>Yet again, blacks are openly clamouring for the economic dispossession of whites - and all I can hear is crickets chirping&hellip;</p>

<p>in other words &#8220;black people&#8221;.  Also our fabled article mentions &#8220;change across the board&#8221;, again- more black people.  i still cant figure our why they think &#8216;diversity&rsquo; means white people giving up everything.  hey lets give the blacks and latinos the USA and maybe all us whites can go to africa and make something out of it.<br>

			<p>Sure; just try and find more whites who will put up with doing all the work for an incompetent AA supervisor, while that supervisor gets all the credit.  I think all the whites already willing to put up with that nonsense are already in the military or in government offices.</p>

<p>Maybe Roland should voice his complaint to the ones really in charge of the operation, David Axlerod, Rahm Emanuel, Bernard Bernanke, Feitner and the rest of the CFR. <br>
Ruth Bader Ginsburg hired over 100 clerks and staff members as an appellate Judge and not one of them was black. </p>

			<p>This man is a real dullard, and I know that by exchanging emails with him.  From the quality of the writing I received from him, with an underlying inability to think in anything but elementary terms, I have to conclude that he has help whenever he writes a column or news story.  The above piece is no work of art by the largest stretch of the immagination, but it&rsquo;s far better than what I know he&rsquo;s capable of, because of my experience with him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering how long these newspapers can continue carrying the extra baggage that requires intense editing and rewording of what their black staff writes.</p>
<p>The news shows like CNN I believe&hellip;..I hope I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;..will probably not be affected by the downturn in the economy, but the newspapers are hurting very badly right now.</p>

			<p>Maybe there is hope for Obama after all.  Hire or appoint the most congenial and competent associate/press secretary/advisors because of their abilities and not their pigmentation: what a radical idea!!  Mr. Martin needs to step back and view their whole spectrum of appointees: are they truly inept, incompetent, or less qualified than a competing minor candidate?? Hardly.  He contends that a black (hybridic) president should remain faithful to the rainbow coalition of the past, the belief that proportionate representation is fair representation, that affirmative action always gave us the most qualified individual, and blah, blah, blah&hellip;  This is a new era.  Each president surrounds himself with those he can trust and who share his values.  Bush was actually more sensitive to the diversity myth than Obama; he hoped that minorities would vote for him if he appointed them to positions of authority.  It&rsquo;s all tribal after all.  Obama is capitalizing on his belief that no matter how non-diversified his choices have been, the minorities will support him in the long run.  Unless a crisis implodes his &#8220;change&#8221; mantra, he will be re-elected in 4 years.  Furthermore, he knows it.</p>

			<p>The President&rsquo;s press secretary is the most important person in his or her administration.  It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what President&rsquo;s do or don&rsquo;t do, what matters is what the media reports.</p>
<p>So the President needs to pick a superlative person to manage the news however is necessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some affirmative action job with the local subway system.  Get real.  Obama&rsquo;s been President for  2 weeks and already the blacks and hispanics are crying racism and whining and complaining.  What a joke they are and what a joke of a country we are for tolerating them, let alone using taxpayer money to fund their operations as we do.</p>

<p>When I was a Probation Officer my supervisor assigned me to &#8220;mentor&#8221; and &#8220;edit&#8221; the affirmative action probation officers illiterate, incoherent sentencing reports.  At least they were grateful and returned my help by talking to some of the horrible families of the criminals on my case load.</p>

<p>On Fox News tonight your points on black incompetence in jornalism would have applied.</p>
<p>On the doctor who had his auto sabatoged, the black reporter on the Fox affiliate kept referring to the doctor&rsquo;s patients as &#8220;clients,&#8221; instead of patients.  Really funny.</p>
<p>If a white made such a blunder he would be out.</p>
<p>Look for journalism standards to slip badly, because more blacks are getting hired.</p>

			<p>Unless every government position and high paid position in the corporate and business environment is filled solely by Blacks or Latinos, there CAN NEVER be enough &#8220;diversit&#8221; to satisfy the crybaby minorities. Bottom line being: The more we give them, the more they take it as their &#8220;constitutional&#8221; right and the MORE THEY WANT!</p>

			<p>Jeb Bush, like his mentally challenged brother inundated his staff with blacks in order to keep them quiet and to give the appearance they were an important part of his team.  The incompetence of his office was blaringly noticeable.</p>
<p>An answer to a letter written to him would sound as if it came from a fourth grade writer, filled with errors, and any return mail by anyone for clarification would receive another letter just as stupid.</p>
<p>Telephone contact was precisely the same way.  The black on the other end never really understood what the call was about and any firm pressure to obtain clarification was answered with more of the same with the exception that more likely than not you would be lectured by the black for not accepting what he/she had to say, claiming you didnt understand him/her.</p>
<p>This present administration will be EXACTLY the same way, and this mentally challenged Martin above gives a good example of what to expect, especially if his ghost writer isn&rsquo;t available.</p>

			<p>There is a limited number of Blacks who can pass for White, intellectually.  There&rsquo;s just not enough Black brains to go around.  If BHO starts putting too many Blacks in important positions, he&rsquo;ll have to start dipping into the shallow end of the gene pool very quickly.  And, as one poster wrote, the Press Secretary is perhaps the most important position, the one who&rsquo;s in charge of lying to the American people.  You can&rsquo;t have some ignoramus with shaky grammar in that spot.  </p>

			<p>I would like to see just ONCE, a white individual RUN for public office (mayor) in a majority black city and WIN.  That does not look like even a remote possibility as blacks generally vote their race.  <br>
When word definitions are purposely distorted (by liberals) and accepted by society, further &#8220;twisting of the truth&#8221; can take place.  For example, &#8220;black majority&#8221; cities are not known by that term.  They are known as &#8220;minority-majority&#8221; cities.  I thought that a &#8220;majority&#8221; was a &#8220;majority&#8221; whether black, white, asian, etc.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s extremely rare, but here&rsquo;s one instance:  Steve Cohen, representing the U.S. House district that includes the city of Memphis.  In 2006, Harold Ford Jr abandoned the seat to run for U.S. Senate, and Cohen was the only white in a crowded Democrat field with several blacks who had their own carved out constituencies.  Those split and Cohen won.  The Memphis blacks tried to coalesce around some black woman to topple Cohen in 2008 in the D-primary, but Cohen won big.  Not that I&rsquo;m happy about it, because he&rsquo;s as liberal as anyone could be.  But the district is majority black.</p>

<p>Are you insane! Most black cities have had numerous black mayors especially New Orleans. There was a white mayor of GARY,INDIANA(90% BLACK) for crying out loud. What is wrong with you, do you completely avoid history just slander blacks for fun. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s funny how many words have changed in meaning over the last few years. To many of us the word DIVERSITY is now equal to PERVERSITY. And the word Afro-American is another joke. I was born on the continent of Africa and have been an American for 35 Wonderful Years in this The Greatest Of ALL Countries, yet I am as white as a snowball. Since when does the word Africa = black?</p>

			<p>I guess Roland is afraid to use the criteria &#8220;content of my character&#8221; as a means of people attaining jobs.  It&rsquo;s better to use a persons physical characteristics rather than their actual capabilities when it comes to hiring.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s extremely rare (white candidate winning in a minority district), but here&rsquo;s one instance: Steve Cohen (white), representing the U.S. House district that includes the city of Memphis.&#8221;</p>
<p>This happened in my town too. The only white candidate got the most primary votes in a crowded field for city council. The Democratic party simply voided the results and ran the next highest vote getter in the general election. It was a large city actually.  </p>
