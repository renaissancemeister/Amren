<h1>Gillibrand Changes Immigration Stance</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Grace Rauh, NY1, February 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As an upstate congresswoman, Kirsten Gillibrand opposed a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally. She also supported financial penalties for so-called sanctuary cities like New York, which don&rsquo;t enforce immigration laws and even favored federal legislation to deputize local police officers to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>A little more than a week into her new job as senator, she&rsquo;s abandoning those positions in an interview with our sister station, NY1 Noticias, and is staking out new ones.</p>
<p>When asked if she will commit to asking President Obama to stop deportations immediately, Gillibrand said, &#8220;Yes. I think it&rsquo;s the wrong approach and based on all the information I&rsquo;ve now learned, I believe that to be the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>After an uproar from Latino groups that greeted her appointment to the Senate, Gillibrand is trying to minimize the significance of her congressional record on immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of these votes, literally, were procedural motions that were taken with five minutes of information given to me about what it says, without the panoply of issues, debate, analysis that I&rsquo;ve had the benefit of here,&#8221; said Gillibrand.</p>
<p>She says her upstate roots put her at a disadvantage when it came to learning about the issue.</p>

			<p>Her upstate roots put her at a disadvantage, never having to avoid drunk illegals plowing into her car, never having to avoid MS-13 gangs standing in her way as she entered her local Wal-Mart, and never having lost her job to computer programmers from<br>
Mumbia. She was unaware of the marvelous characteristics these &#8220;new Americans&#8221; bring to our country.</p>

			<p>This only goes to show what much wiser men than me have been posting on AmRen for ages  &mdash;   that the two main Parties in this Country are utterly incapable of effectively dealing with the immigration nightmare facing the United States, as even conservatives in both are forced to tout a pro-immigrant line by their Party elders. </p>
<p>Until Americans begin to embrace 3rd Parties in massive numbers, our borders cannot be fixed and our culture cannot be saved. </p>

			<p>Another traitorous politician that sides with illegal invaders over American citizens.  I can&rsquo;t believe in this economic climate that the open borders crowd would even have the courage to show their faces.  It&rsquo;s unfathomable to me.  Jobs dissolving at an alarming rate and these people still want uncontrolled third world immigration.    </p>

			<p>Obama has worked his magic on her. People will sell their souls and betray their principles for him. Why?</p>
<p>All Obama has to do is smile at his critics and they become his most devolved supporters.  This is getting scary. </p>

<p>Please elaborate.  The merits of the arguments that swayed her should be judged by the citizens who put her there.</p>

<p> *  What&rsquo;s complex or difficult to understand about illegal immigration?   Illegal is illegal!  Period. Very simple.</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;She says her upstate roots put her at a disadvantage when it came to learning about the issue.&#8221;</i></p>
<p> *  She means it put her at a disadvantage for getting the senate appointment.</p>

			<p>This woman seems to have either backpeddaled or flip-flopped on every political stance she once held! An interesting strategy for becoming Senator - prevaricate like the wind. She&rsquo;ll fit right in with the rest of Washington DC! When, on day one, she went to Harlem to rub elbows with that &#8216;ol charlatan Sharpton, I pretty much knew everything I needed to know. </p>

<p>Blaming things on her upstate roots is a capout to appease the illegal immigration lobby&hellip;ridiculous!</p>

<p>If she wants to stay in the Democrat party she had better change her views to conform to thm or she won&rsquo;t be given the time of day&hellip;..ever.</p>
<p>Such a sad situation.</p>

<p>So, she is saying that as a representative, she was inattentive and lazy, and her work was sloppy.</p>

<p>You are quite right.  The democrats have become the party of treason, and the republicans seem eager to follow them.  Nothing can be salvaged from these organizations.  We need a new party altogether.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how quickly these so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221; will turn their backs in favor of special interest/illegal invader groups and against the American people in order to stay in power&hellip;</p>
<p>Another groveling politician&hellip;</p>
<p>It is truly We the People versus our own government.  The sooner we can enhance and vote in a Third Party, like the Constitution Party with Chuck Baldwin, the better!</p>

			<p>People must understand that she is a woman of principal who was acosted and politically bludgeoned by thugs. The Rockefeller/CFR backyard is NY. Here, A lawmaker would never be punished for voting for an amnesty since most NYers only care about their ipods, X-Boxes, Blackberries, etc,. Just don&rsquo;t be too hard on the young lady. She&rsquo;s a one-term house member who got thrown into this mess. Welcome to the bigs! who knows, they probably threatened her family. &#8220;Comprehensive&#8221; Immigration Reform and the DREAM Act will be defeated with or without her so it really doesn&rsquo;t matter in the long run. These two measures are coming up this year and we should be bracing for a fight. Just as in 2007, the American people will win again!</p>

			<p>Kev, at 9:20PM on Febuary5, said, &#8220;People must understand that she is a woman of principle&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Kev. I have noticed that people who ar really principled, whatever nation they are from, or whatever it is they beleive in, usually walk the talk. Mrs. Gillibrand should have resigned. Yes, riesigned. We have so many politicians who claim to be principled about one thing or another, but when they are called upon to prove it, all they end up doing is showing us that their talk about their belief in principles was tested and found wanting.</p>

			<p>I agree with Bobby here. If she were truly &#8220;a woman of principle&#8221; and not a political opportunist, she would have stood by those principles and not shifted her position to suit whichever way the wind is blowing at the moment.  Just how &#8220;principled&#8221; is that?  I&rsquo;d say it is the very opposite!  Principled indeed!</p>
