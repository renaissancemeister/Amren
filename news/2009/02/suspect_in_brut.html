<h1>Suspect in Brutal Beating of Ecuadoran Immigrant Caught Smiling on Camera Minutes After Murder</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leo Standora, Erica Pearson and Alison Gendar, Daily News (New York), Feburary 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From his laughing face caught on video, no one would guess Keith Phoenix had just beaten a man to death with a baseball bat in what police call a bias attack.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old murder suspect was all smiles as he pulled into an RFK bridge cash lane Dec. 7  &mdash;  just 19 minutes after he beat Ecuadoran immigrant Jose Sucuzhanay to death on a Brooklyn street, cops said.</p>
<p>Police released the chilling surveillance video Thursday as cops hunt for Phoenix, who lives in the Bronx.</p>
<p>Another suspect, Hakim Scott, 25, was caught Tuesday and is awaiting arraignment on charges of second-degree murder as a hate crime.</p>
<p>Yelling anti-gay slurs, the duo attacked Sucuzhanay, 31,  mistakenly thinking the real estate agent was gay because he was walking arm-in-arm with his brother, cops said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The crime spurred hundreds to march in Brooklyn in protest against racism and bigotry and drew condemnations from many politicians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City Council Speaker Christine Quinn urged New Yorkers to &#8220;stand together to denounce such reprehensible acts,&#8221; adding &#8220;we will not tolerate hate crimes of any kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Witnesses said the attackers hurled anti-gay and anti-Hispanic slurs at Sucuzhanay and his brother Romel, 38, who survived the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s aunt Ella Moore claimed her nephew had nothing against Hispanics or gays, saying, &#8220;He&rsquo;s a good kid and this is sad.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Until now, I didn&rsquo;t know the suspects were black.  For all we know, especially from the caterwauling from Official New York City, this was an example of white right-wing rhetoric inspiring people to hate and kill.</p>

			<p>He was a good kid.  He was planning to be a Rap star or a basket ball player or a cop.  It is too bad that society made him do this.</p>

			<p>First of all I would like to give my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Jose Sucuzhanay. But we all know that if the victim was white, he or she would be a victim of &#8220;random violence&#8221;. Why is that? </p>

			<p>I heard this on the TV/Radio news over and over here in New York and all they said was this was a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; (because the victim was Spanish, (possibly illegal) and (possibly) gay - which is a trifecta for the &#8216;grievance&rsquo; hustlers), but they <b>NEVER</b> mentioned the <b>RACE</b> of the suspect, which of course in this culture, is meant to mentally lead the brain-dead to automatically assume the suspect was white.</p>
<p>What else is new?</p>

			<p>Have you ever noticed how all these smiling, smirking killers, rapists and thieves are always described as &#8220;good kids&#8221;.  Did you ever stop to think that their black relatives and friends might consider them &#8220;good&#8221; not despite of the violence against other races but because of it?  After all they are standing up for their people and are increasing real black power in America.  They are the threat that justifies the last 45 years of wealth redistribution in America.  </p>
<p>These black thugs are the young braves of the Black tribe.  Every one of them that fathers a child with a white or hispanic woman is following the path of the native Americans who captured women and used them to create more braves for the tribe.  What makes it even better for them is they usually don&rsquo;t even invest any time or resources in the raising of these half breed recruits.  There are white grandmothers all over America raising the black warriors who will grow up to be an even greater and more numerous threat to the white race.  Our mulatto &#8220;Commander in Chief&#8221; is a perfect example of these mixed raced children and the hatred they have for their white blood.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t post racial in America.  We won&rsquo;t ever be at this rate.  We are in a race war that will determine who controls what is left of the United States after the socialist and globalist are done running it into the ground.  Unfortunately the only race that doesn&rsquo;t know what is going on is the whites.  The blacks and the hispanics know exactly what is going on and they are playing to win.</p>

<p>He probably was &#8216;white&rsquo;, the real reason he was attacked.  </p>

			<p>Poor Hispanics. They only get to be Hispanic when they are victims. If they are the proud perpetrators of a hate crime, they get their racial identity stripped away, to the ignominy of being categorized as White  &mdash;  oh the racissssm of it all&hellip;yeah&hellip; Oh, and most blacks really don&rsquo;t like Hispanics and vice versa. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he is a good kid, because all he did was murder someone using a baseball bat just for fun.  What more proof is needed to prove that point?</p>

<p>So true.  We will either be post-racial when Whites wake up and get rid of this or, unfortunately, when we are destroyed.  Obama in the White House is the signal for the war to begin.  Blacks and other non-Whites can only take advantage of this administration and the administration itself will be doing the same.  These people are gathering power now and they want to stick to the White Man very badly now that they feel that they have power.  Hopefully this &#8220;getting worse&#8221; will awaken Whites or at least assist in that process.</p>

<p><br>
You always know, because if the suspects were white, the media would be all over it.  NPR, NYT, AP and all the other usual suspects would be running sensationalist, &#8220;racist white&#8221; stories.  99 times out of 100, if the perp&rsquo;s race isn&rsquo;t mentioned, you know&hellip;</p>

			<p>I agree, if the perp was white, you&rsquo;d never hear the end of this story.  Al Sharpton and the rest of the &#8220;Race Hustler&rsquo;s&#8221; would have their megaphones out and their unemployed constituants would be marching around some govt. building holding signs.  Because the victim is Latino and was thought to be gay, the news media covers the story.  In Cleveland last week, two white medical workers were shot in the back of the head, gangster-style, while at an ATM after a birthday party for a co-worker.  Our wonderful paper, the Plain Dealer did not give one clue to the perpetrator&rsquo;s race.  Their &#8220;editorial&#8221; writer wrote a column condeming whites for &#8220;jumping to conclusions&#8221; about the race of the thugs.  The paper then interviewed one of the suspects father and he was given a half a page to blame the white victims.  So,  Six Africans attempt to kill two white guys at an ATM.  They succeed in killing one, and severely wound the other, and the Cleveland media immediately sides with the perps.  And they wonder why no sane white person will go downtown after sunset.</p>

			<p>If they would have done this to a white guy, there would be no report in the papers or on the tv or radio&hellip;.they only want to cover stories about those poor illegals or poor blacks.  Whites don&rsquo;t count, we only pay all the bills!</p>

<p>At 28, he&rsquo;s hardly a &#8220;kid&#8221; and he sure isn&rsquo;t &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wish I had a dollar for every time some black &#8220;kid&#8221; or &#8220;youth&#8221; broke the law and his aunt, mother or grandmother (never his father) went off running at the mouth about how &#8220;good&#8221; he was. I hate to think what a BAD black kid must be like.</p>

			<p>I am ashamed to share a family name with one of the attackers of these two men.</p>
<p>My closest contact with a homosexual man was a ride up to campus at UC Santa Cruz as an undergrad.  He was very polite about it, and told me how much work he did as a volunteer for &#8220;gay rights&#8221; organizations.  He was quite decent about being rejected when I told him I was straight and that I preferred petite blondes and Oriental women.  </p>
<p>Hating gays is silly, execpt for their objectionable left-wing politics.</p>

<p>Well I kind of figured they were black. Keith Phoenix&rsquo;s accomplice&rsquo;s name is Hakim Scott. How many white boys have you heard of with a name like that? (Muslim given name plus Anglo surname)<br>

			<p>You people know of course, that these two men were not killed because they were perceived as being gay. They were killed simply because they were hispanic. This horrendous act by these blacks, respresents a growing resentment-and hatred-from blacks toward the hispanics, who now have a greater advantage than blacks in this country because of there ability to assimulate.   </p>
<p>Of course, the MSM would not even &#8220;speculate&#8221; or &#8220;comment&#8221; on the hard core truth of the matter.   </p>

<p> &#8220;..if the perp&rsquo;s race isn&rsquo;t mentioned you know&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I commend you on an insightful post. And you are absolutely right. The media&rsquo;s silence tells you everything you need to know. They will never hesitate to mention a WHITE suspect. It reminds me of the old tale of the shipman recording in his log &#8216;the Captain was SOBER today&rsquo;. The unstated implication being the Captain is a drunk.</p>

<p>As someone who went to a black high school I can tell this, you almost never see one because they are all in jail or dead. They are so ruthless they dont attack numbers because they got knives guns and other objects in their arsenal. They are vicious and cold blooded to the bone. Troubled teen doesnt even fit the describition because they are so hell bent on destruction and self statisfaction that they will go to any lengths (rape, murder, steal, and extortion) to please themselves. </p>
<p>Trust me you wouldnt want to meet one, when look one in the eyes its almost like your not seeing a human being and if they notice that your looking them in the eyes that could be the last time you ever do that again. This guy is one of those people Im describing just look at his eyes.</p>

			<p>A Black male could slaughter a whole preschool, rape a carload of nuns, runover a few grandmothers at a church picnic, set a hospital on fire and stomp a basket of kittens to death&hellip;and still some fellow Black would stand-up immediately to proclaim them a &#8220;good&#8221; person without hesitation or a hint of reservation. Surely this must tell us something about the Black mindset&hellip;    </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not enough. White Americans have been brainwashed into loving race-mixing. That&rsquo;s why the Race war is going to have to reach unfathomable hieghts before the white race WAKE-UP. It was unconscionable to allow a Mulatto to become president. It should have never happened, but now that it has what can us proud to be white Americans do?</p>

			<p>Can you imagine how disappointed the liberal elite must be over the race of these perps? But you will also now see the black phenomenon of Circling The Wagons take place. Almost every black from the lowest homeless bum to the AG of the USA will rally round these creatures. It is always fun to watch as two or more of the the great liberal ideologies clash, as in this case gay, alien, hispanic, and black. This case will prove beyond a doubt that black will always trump everything else.</p>

			<p>You know, everytime some thug down here in Alabama gets it from the cops, the family always starts the same old garbage that he was a good boy, sang in the choir, attended church regularly, and the police didn&rsquo;t have to shoot him.  Like one cop who shot a guy who got his baton away from him and beat him so hard in his head, he could hardly see, blood dripping down in his eyes, and was on the verge of passing out, which would have left him totally at the thug&rsquo;s mercy.  Well, guess what?  This guy was a &#8220;choir boy&#8221;, too, whith quite a rap sheet.  Or another one where a black cop was surrounded and attacked by a large group of black thugs, he shot one of them and just because the thug saw it coming and turned in time for the bullet to hit him in the back, the cop was sent to prison.  Thank God, he is out now and his friends on the force, black and white helped him and his family.  <br>
If your family member is selling drugs, breaking into houses or businesses, committing armed robbery, pimping teenaged girls, killing and assaulting people, HE IS NOT A GOOD BOY!!!!!</p>

			<p>How come in the black community they always excuse the criminals as &#8220;oh, he was a good kid&#8221; or &#8220;he&rsquo;s speaking out against the racist system&#8221;.  Always some excuse to justify or alleviate any responsibility for their wrongdoings.  </p>
