<h1>The South African President&rsquo;s Harem</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>R.W. Johnson, National Post (Toronto), February 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The ongoing row in the South African press over President Kgalema Motlanthe&rsquo;s complicated love life has brought out into the open a subject that much of the country&rsquo;s ruling black elite would rather keep hidden. Motlanthe, 59, is estranged from his wife, has a steady 45-year-old mistress and a 24-year-old, now heavily pregnant, lover. The African National Congress (ANC) spokesman, Carl Niehaus, insists that media attention is an invasion of privacy, but South African journalists have proven underwhelmed by this response.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago, Niehaus issued a statement denouncing as &#8220;lies&#8221; reports that the ANC leader (and, doubtless, South Africa&rsquo;s future president), Jacob Zuma, was about to marry a fifth wife. When the reports were quickly proved true, Niehaus hurriedly insisted that Zuma&rsquo;s behaviour, though &#8220;in line with African custom and tradition,&#8221; was a private matter. Still, South African journalists want to know: Who exactly is our First Lady? In particular, which of Zuma&rsquo;s five wives (he is currently courting a sixth) will be the First Lady at his presidential inauguration in April?</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&rsquo;re really looking at here is a collision of cultures which has been going on ever since the first missionaries landed at the Cape,&#8221; says sociologist Laurence Schlemmer. &#8220;To an extraordinary extent, the missionaries managed to associate the Christian ideal of monogamy with high social status and modernity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Zuma is unusual in his frank acknowledgement of his own polygamy. In the eyes of many educated Africans, this is a shameful sign of his cultural backwardness  &mdash;  that, as former president Thabo Mbeki put it, Zuma is still a traditional Zulu peasant at heart. All educated Africans publicly deplore the ever-expanding harems maintained by the Swazi and Zulu kings. But among less-educated Africans  &mdash;  Zuma&rsquo;s natural followers  &mdash;  polygamy is far more easily accepted.</p>
<p>Stanley Mogoba, former president of the Pan Africanist Congress, has said that &#8220;virtually none of the African National Congress leadership have normal and stable family lives. There are multiple but hidden wives and mistresses, ex-wives, unacknowledged and hidden children, every imaginable sort of arrangement. Sometimes, they seem almost to turn themselves inside out trying to be or appear what they are really not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, officially, Nelson Mandela has been serially monogamous with three consecutive wives. But it is no secret that, at least when he was young, he was a philanderer on a large scale, and there are persistent rumours of illegitimate children. Mbeki was also known to be a ladies man on an almost industrial scale. The accusation could hardly be denied, but drawing attention to it was impermissible, especially since Mbeki was haunted by notions that the AIDS epidemic had confirmed stereotypes of lustful and sexually irresponsible African male behaviour. Similarly, neither Motlanthe nor Zuma welcomes questions about, or even attention being paid to, their marital lives.</p>
<p>This anomalous situation is compounded by the fact that although polygamy is legal in South Africa and homophobia common, the South African constitution is one of the world&rsquo;s most progressive in its acknowledgement and championing of gay rights and gender equality. Feminists have won legal battles over inheriting property  &mdash;  even though in African customary law a widow and all her chattels belong to her late husband&rsquo;s family  &mdash;  and have angrily denounced polygamy as a form of female subordination.</p>
<p>But even such feminist advances have their own contradictions: When Joe Modise, the notoriously corrupt former defence minister, died, his wife asserted her right to inherit his considerable wealth. The trouble was that so did his regular mistress. A battle royal ensued.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising, then, that the black elite are trying to keep the subject of polygamy out of the press. It brings to light too much embarrassment and anxiety about what constitutes &#8220;respectable&#8221; behaviour.</p>
<p>Still, the question remains: Who is South Africa&rsquo;s First Lady?<br>

			<p>When will black people get their act togther. It&rsquo;s sad when a large portion of a ethnic group. This behavior is the sick and shouldn&rsquo;t be condone. It is sad when members of the human race choose to wrong even when hurts them and their people.</p>

In Africa, it&rsquo;s tribal leaders. In America, it&rsquo;s pimps.</p>
<p>And I always love reading the term &#8216;serially monogamous&rsquo; in regards to blacks. An absurd oxymoron.</p>

			<p>I see no problem with this.  It is their culture; let them run it as they please.  In most primate species there is wide-spread sexual permissiveness   &mdash;   both sexes mate with different partners.  However, usually the dominant male achieves most matings.  Throughout history, and even today, most human societies are polygynous (males having multiple partners).  In fact, monogamy may be an aberrant behavior in humans.  Monogamy does have advantages in terms of family stability and wealth creation, and in fact, Western civilization has done quite well using this system.  However, that does not mean that it is the &#8220;natural&#8221; state for humans.  If Africans want to practice polygamy   &mdash;   then let them.    </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t care too much about polygymy; if you can support more than one wife and your resultant family - and no one is forced, then more power to you.  Many of European extraction actually have Royal blood because most Kings and other nobles impregnated unknown but huge numbers of young women all over their territories.  But that is why there was an important designation term - &#8220;bastard.&#8221;  It was not a dirty word, just implied that the child could not claim hereditary rights.  But when no legitimate offspring was present as in William the Bastard&rsquo;s case, he might become a Duke and a Conqueror.</p>
<p>What we need is reality in our movement not adherence to &#8220;Moral&#8221; laws that really only restrain us.</p>

			<p>As far as I know polygamy is not legal in South Africa. The black gangster government turns a blind eye to many &#8220;traditional&#8221; arrangements, but they are extra-legal and would certainly never be allowed among whites.</p>
<p>I must disagree with Whiteplight; adherence to moral laws that restrain us is what makes our civilization superior. Monogamy might not be a &quot;natural&quot; condition, but it is an institution that has served us well, and moreover is a beautiful ideal that deserves protection.</p>

			<p>Even America&rsquo;s most celebrated national hero, MLK, was a serial philander who repulsed his own friends with his adulterous and degenerate behavior.</p>

&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re really looking at here is a collision of cultures which has been going on ever since the first missionaries landed at the Cape,&rdquo; says sociologist Laurence Schlemmer. &ldquo;To an extraordinary extent, the missionaries managed to associate the Christian ideal of monogamy with high social status and modernity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
No, you self-hating white apologist for black backwardness, it is Nature herself that equates monogamy with high social status and modernity. The (European) missionaries merely tried to point that out that fact to the locals. </p>
<p>To no avail, apparently. </p>
<p>If you want an advanced, prosperous, First World nation, monogamy MUST be, if not rigidly enforced, then at least held up as the common ideal that everyone should shoot for. Having leaders whose sexual behavior is no different from alleycats will only encourage the masses to behave the same way. </p>
<p>And when they do, you can forget about ever having that advanced, prosperous, First World nation. All you&rsquo;ll EVER get under those conditions is a chaotic, poverty-stricken Third World nation. </p>
<p>This is true regardless of the race of that nation&rsquo;s citizens   &mdash;   although it is obviously more of a problem with Africans than with anybody else. </p>

			<p>I must second the opinions of Anonymous at 12:19 PM on February 7.  And nothing more in fact needs to be said.  Western civilization is a combination of classical rationalism and Christian idealism.  This is all that we need, all that we should strive for.  Any large deviation therefrom will only accelerate our demise, as is witnessed by the constant assault on our culture.   </p>

<p>In this critical period when the birth-rate among Whites is declining, we need more white babies. If polygamy can help to reverse this demographic decline, I would welcome it. Whites have proven the superiority of their civilization several times over. Now, they have to do everything in their power to secure their future. </p>
