<h1>Bill Seeks Limits on Hiring Foreign Bank Workers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rita Beamish and Frank Bass, AP, February 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two senators on Wednesday proposed requiring bailed-out banks to hire only Americans for one year, after an investigation by The Associated Press showed that banks receiving the most federal aid had requested visas for thousands of foreign workers even as they laid off employees amid the economic collapse.</p>
<p>The legislation by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, would apply to more than 200 banks that have accepted the government&rsquo;s aid. They would be barred from hiring foreigners who hold special visas that are reserved for certain skilled and advanced-degree jobs. Both senators are longtime critics of abuses they see in the visa program.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is obscene and vulgar for these huge banks getting taxpayer bailouts to use the bailouts to throw American workers on the street and bring in foreign workers,&#8221; Sanders said.</p>
<p>The proposal was certain to inflame all sides of an already contentious issue that has attracted new passion amid soaring U.S. unemployment rates. An immigration lawyers group earlier this week warned of renewed criticism of the H1-B visa program due to the country&rsquo;s lousy economic conditions and rallied its members in an e-mail to be prepared to &#8220;set the record straight!&#8221;</p>
<p>The president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Charles Kuck, whose members represent employers and foreign nationals, said the Senate proposal would hinder any economic recovery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prospects for the legislation&rsquo;s passage were not immediately clear. The proposal was being filed as an amendment to the stimulus bill under consideration in the Senate as part of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s plan to reinvigorate the economy.</p>
<p>Sanders said the legislation was proposed in response to an AP investigation showing that the dozen banks now receiving the biggest rescue packages, totaling more than $150 billion, requested visas for more than 21,800 foreign workers over the past six years for high-paying jobs.</p>

			<p>Is banking all of a sudden one of those jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t do?  Or do the H1B visa holders work for much cheaper?  I&rsquo;m surprised Bernie Sanders wants to crack down, even temporarily.  But I wish it would be more permanent.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a customer of Bank of America and there don&rsquo;t seem to be any American white people working at the branches I use.  They are all either minorities or immigrants.  </p>

			<p>It would be a lovely thing indeed if every single company, corporation, Federal Department, and State that received our tax-dollars from this stimulus could only be allowed to hire American citizens for any job openings. Lovely, yes, but as long as Democrats and (supposodly &#8220;conservative&#8221;) Republicans are the only parties represented on Capital Hill, it won&rsquo;t happen, and more and more of what is right with American culture will be sold off to fund the streams of illegals who are turning the United States into the Estados Unitos. </p>

			<p>So this bill is co-sponsored by America&rsquo;s only socialist Congressmen.  And capitalists are the ones trying to bring more immigrants here.  That says a lot.  </p>

			<p>Funny how they were &#8216;global&rsquo; corporations with a global &#8216;world view&rsquo; but only ran to the US government and American taxpayers for help. They are so voraciously greedy they, at the same time, seek to destroy their only source of income by advocating policies that swamp us with low wage workers that undercut our standard of living.</p>

<p>The Arabs in Kuwait and Saudi also employ Indians to take care of their banks in EVERY aspect of the banking business. I say that one day, an Indian with just a keystroke, will EFT the entire wealth of the muslim world into an account in Mumbai.</p>

			<p>Thank God someone in the Senate has some sense.  It is monumentally unfair to expect taxpayers to bail out banks who won&rsquo;t hire us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like a nice job again, too.  I used to be the best chemist in the world in my field.  Unfortunately, I have a federal felony conviction for something I once said, so now I work as a wlder and auto mechanic out of my garage.  Nobody hires Americans to do what I used to do, felony or no.  </p>

			<p>The &#8220;stimulus&#8221; package is just another DEMOCRAT PORK BARREL project. The Tax-and-Spenders trying to buy themselves a good name, while beggaring taxpayers by getting them nearly a TRILLION DOLLARS DEEPER IN DEBT!!</p>
<p>If the Tax-o-Crats really want to stimulate the economy&hellip; here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<p>SEND ALL IMMIGRANTS BACK IMMEDIATELY! Give them 90 days to leave voluntarily or after 90 days, stage massive round-ups and pack them off. If they are forcibly deported, they get stripped of all assets, being permitted to leave only with the clothes on their backs.</p>
<p>Seal the border TIGHT! American workers have lost enough jobs to cheap working illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Some food for thought: So the illegal immigrant mestizos work for minimum or sub-minimum wage today&hellip; their adult anchor babies will be competing with OUR children and grandchildren for ever-scarcer American jobs! Is THAT what YOU really want?</p>

			<p>I have faith in our American system. As soon as somebody overseas complains about wanting to hire Americans, we will cave, just like we did with the buy America part of the stimulate package.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest if Chinese workers are going to benefit from America taxpayers, why shouldn&rsquo;t Indian bankers? </p>

Of course!  That fact is so glaringly clear, why can&rsquo;t our politicians see  it?  It&rsquo;s amazing how blind they can be.  They have no sense of historical perspective and can&rsquo;t see beyond the next election, much less a generation away.</p>

<p>The children of illegal immigrants won&rsquo;t be competing with the children of native born whites - they&rsquo;ll be given preferences.  Its only the illegal parents that will be doing the jobs &#8220;Americans don&rsquo;t want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its racist to expect yough mestizos to work for lower wages than whites, regardless of demonstrable ability.  They will be accomodated - or else.  </p>

			<p>H1B visas and outsourcing are what caused the problem in the first place! Americans were passed over for jobs that were given to people from other countries waving a hot visa.</p>
