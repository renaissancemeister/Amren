			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brad Edwards, WJBK-TV (Detroit), February 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All this week, we&rsquo;ve brought you stories from people who say they&rsquo;ve been ignored by police. Even Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel, Jr. admitted there&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>This is the story of an entire neighborhood disappearing because of that very issue. In this video report, FOX 2&rsquo;s Brad Edwards takes you to a place where the boarded up homes now outnumber the people who live there.</p>

			<p>The land and houses are valuable as they lay in the middle of a huge metropolitan area, Detroit, but no one other than Blacks could ever hope to live in the area without subjecting themselves to the risk or serious physical violence and/or death.<br>
    No white person even dares to DRIVE a car around these neighborhoods without police. Even the police tell motorists that if you are in an accident in Detroit to not stop your car and never get our of your car, just keep on driving and report the accident to the police at another safer time.<br>
    If there is anywhere on the face of the earth where the laws of the United States no longer apply it is in Detroit where murder and mayhem are a daily occurence and crime is seldom if ever punished.<br>
    Ask any person from the Detroit area where the &#8220;tank traps and gun implacements&#8221; are and they will tell you 8 mile road, the dividing line between Detroit and the white suburbs.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the police have abandoned this neighborhood because nobody&rsquo;s there.  You figure, if you have a whole census tract where one person lives, he or she isn&rsquo;t bound to be much a problem for cops, because s/he doesn&rsquo;t have any neighbors to quarrel and fight with.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I saw the video earlier. No one dares give the real reason for the problem; that African-Americans tolerate a higher level of violence than whites  &mdash;  and they don&rsquo;t like whites.</p>
<p>I once took the wrong bus in downtown Chicago. When I realized my error and got off, some other whites that were getting off told me to get out of the area as fast as I could or I would be killed. And that was 30 years ago.</p>

			<p>You can see those were nice middle class houses.  Now they are dilapidated with trash and junk strewn all over.  </p>
<p>And the police don&rsquo;t even show up.  I wonder if that is because the police are really afraid or if they are just incompetent/uncaring.  Either way Detroit is a mess.</p>

			<p>Notice they don&rsquo;t delve into what happened to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t talk about the demographic transition and what it meant to the earlier homeowners.  She talks about how the neighborhood used to be great when she was a kid, but the reporter never asks, so what happened? Or who is behind the crime and why the police won&rsquo;t show up?  Why have people moved out for good and why people don&rsquo;t revitalize it?  These questions would be part of a report in most cities, but in Detroit, the answers are obvious but remain unspoken.</p>
<p>No, they just report it as though it unfortunately rained one day and that changed everything.</p>

			<p>  This is coming to your neighborhood. Obama will increase section 8 payments (now called &#8220;Housing Choice&#8221;) to a level that will allow the oppressed minorities to move to virtually any area. Up to now the payments have been below the level of rents in upper middle-class areas, but &#8216;Bamas going to change that.</p>

			<p>Like most 40-somethings living in suburban Detroit, my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. had all lived in the city. Those who didn&rsquo;t leave after the riots managed to hold out until the late seventies. As a kid I spent most of my weekends visiting relatives in the city and fishing on Belle Isle with my dad.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago my brother and I would occasionally take a ride thru the city just to see how many of these houses were still standing. It&rsquo;s a surreal experience to say the least. </p>
<p>The cycle starts out quick enough: The property is turned into a rental, destroyed by the tenants, abandoned, stripped and burned (maybe having served some time as a crack house during the process). Then time stands still and Mother Nature goes to work. These houses can literally collapse before the city gets around to demolishing them. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what 40 years of cultural enrichment can do for a city. </p>

			<p>Those remaining houses in the video are (were) bungalows from the 1920s, probably built for upwardly mobile white families.  It must have been a pleasant, middle-class neighborhood.  Perhaps this woman is the granddaughter of one of those original residents.  I have seen neighborhoods like this in St. Louis, as well, where entire blocks, once occupied by stately brick townhouses and close to the city core, are today nothing more than open grassland.</p>

			<p>My dad got to witness the 1967 riots firsthand&hellip;he said they started down the street from where he worked and he couldn&rsquo;t go home for 3 days (he worked at a Wrigley&rsquo;s store, I think).</p>
<p>He said Highland Park was a really nice neighborhood.  He grew up in Detroit in the 40s, said it was nice&hellip;they showed movies in the park, and you could sleep in the park and no one would bother you.</p>
<p>I lived in Detroit  &mdash;  the inner city  &mdash;  from age 3 months to 3 years.  There&rsquo;s a vacant lot where our apartment house once stood, burned down after we moved to the suburbs.  I think the Trumbull Market is about the only building still standing on that block on that side of the road.</p>

			<p>Oh my God thats terrible, and I thought my neighborhood is bad. I wonder if this is included in the stimulus (socialist) bill to jump start the economy. America is hurting and this is living proof. </p>
<p>So many blacks everyday go out of their way to avoid being sterotyped yet they have to turn on the T.V. and see the mess their younger generation has caused.</p>
<p>WHAT A SHAME. ANYONE THINK AL, JESSE, OR THE NAACP WILL JUMP ON THIS AND POINT OUT THE PROMBLEMS BLACK YOUTHS ARE CAUSING? </p>

			<p>It kills me inside to see that.   That was my hometown, too.   Knowing that the very same cancer is destroying cities &amp; communities all across the country is terribly depressing. </p>
<p>Seeing that the very same thing is not only being done to &#8220;merely&#8221; the U.S.A., but every white society on earth, is truly horrifying.  </p>
<p>Seeing the blindness (sometimes, a desperately willful blindness) of ignorant and brainwashed whites who do all they can to assist those who are destroying us, including rabidly attacking other whites if they do so much as dare to cry out in protest, or even whisper a warning of the danger.<br>
 (Eerily similar to the beasts themselves, who when not committing outright murder in the first place, very typically threaten worse as retribution for any resistance to or reporting of the crimes they commit.  As if they won&rsquo;t get around to killing you anyway. ) <br>
It is a sad, sad thing.  It is frustrating, maddening- infuriating!  Infuriating, as my desire for life rails against this plague.</p>
<p> Sometimes, I feel like a ghost, wailing for a life already lost&hellip;</p>

<p>   The same thing happened to me in New Orleans years ago. I crossed Canal Street and got lost at nightfall. The neighborhood was really getting rough when a black cab driver stopped and said &#8220;Sir what are you doing here?&#8221; &#8220;You shouldn&rsquo;t be around here.&#8221; He picked me up and took me to my hotel in the French Quarter. But for his honesty and kindness, I might have been another N.O. crime statistic. </p>

<p>You would think.</p>
<p>People should be encouraged to have guns.  An armed society is a polite society.  Plus it would help get rid of budget problems some police departments have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually glad I no longer live in the Detroit area.  I&rsquo;ve been living in a predominantly white area of Ohio the past 16 years (think Amish buggies).  I feel safer here.</p>

			<p>This story&rsquo;s hardly unique to Detroit, though Detroit is certainly a prime example of urban jungle.  </p>
<p>I live in a Philadelphia suburb, and on those rare occasions when I have to go into certain areas of the city, I do so armed, and never after dark.  Fortunately, PA is relatively liberal in its issuance of carry permits. </p>

really obligated to respond. This was stated by a guy who<br>
was on the morning radio program with Mueller.<br>

<p>They should, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they will. &#8220;chicagone&#8221; is correct   &mdash;   the police are under <b>no legal obligation whatever</b> to respond to a 911 call, prevent a crime or stop a crime in progress. Nor does the reason matter   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re on a higher-priority call, they don&rsquo;t want to interrupt their donut break, you name it. All they&rsquo;re required to do is investigate, collect evidence and file reports. Many people have sued the police for failure to respond; they&rsquo;ve always lost, even at the SCOTUS level.</p>

<p>Looks like she has been living there since childhood, since she talks about playing outside under the streetlights as a kid. And since they also mention that she is a senior, she obviously remembers the good ole days, before riots and diversity was thrust on the city. Considering she has been there so long, and has seen worse than most of us can begin to imagine, I seriously doubt she loves diversity. It&rsquo;s clear she would love nothing more than to see her old neighborhood return to it&rsquo;s glory days, when it was safe, and mostly white. But greedy block busters destroyed that dream years ago. </p>

			<p>No Longer Liberal- Unless one personally experiences the criminal<br>
pathology of blacks he can&rsquo;t believe how bad it is. The average suburban white has been subjected to years of brainwashing in the schools and media that we are equal save for some superficial differences in appearance. This programming refuses to allow these people to see just how great the differences are.</p>
<p>  The first response when confronted with the true black behavior is &#8220;it&rsquo;s cultural, or more likely- you&rsquo;re just dealing with the low class blacks, the middle class ones are just like us.&#8221;  Problem is, there are very, very few blacks &#8220;just like  us&#8221;.</p>
<p>  The best you can  do is to put it on a personal level- &#8220;This is a dangerous place to live, our family is not safe. I want to feel safe.&#8221;</p>
