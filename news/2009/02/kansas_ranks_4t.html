<h1>Kansas Ranks 4th in Rate of Black Homicide Victims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina M. Woods, Wichita Eagle, February 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kansas has the fourth-highest per capita rate of black homicide victims in the country, according to an analysis of FBI data by a national gun-control advocacy group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time in the three years the Violence Policy Center has released the study that Kansas has been in the top five. The center is based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a crisis that is devastating black teens and adults across our nation,&#8221; Josh Sugarmann, a study co-author and the center&rsquo;s executive director, said in a statement. &#8220;The key role played by guns in black homicide victimization cannot be denied and must be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study, which analyzed unpublished FBI homicide data from 2006, also finds that firearms  &mdash;  namely handguns  &mdash;  are involved in the majority of homicides.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of times, victims and families just need a good strong support system or a mentorship  &mdash;  someone to model good behavior,&#8221; said [chaplain Merri] Reed, whose ministry provides assistance and channels resources to families affected by violence.</p>
<p>The study, released last week, calculates and compares black homicide victimization rates by dividing the number of black homicides by the number of black residents in the state using U.S. Census Bureau population statistics, then multiplying that figure by 100,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Wichita&rsquo;s numbers</b></p>
<p>Wichita Deputy Police Chief Tom Stolz said the department annually analyzes local homicide statistics and finds that African-Americans typically lead homicide victims  &mdash;  and suspects.</p>
<p>Last year, African-Americans made up more than half of the city&rsquo;s 35 homicide victims, according to police statistics. In 2007, black people made up 19 of the city&rsquo;s 43 homicide victims.</p>
<p>In 2006, the year the national study focused on, blacks made up half of the city&rsquo;s homicide victims. That year, black men alone were 10 of the year&rsquo;s 26 homicide victims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that you have a greater chance of being victim of part one crime because of your color or race, to me, something&rsquo;s wrong with that picture,&#8221; Stolz said, &#8220;part one&#8221; referring to serious or violent crimes such as homicide, burglary, robbery, rape, vehicle theft, aggravated assault and larceny.</p>
<p><b>Breaking the cycle</b></p>
<p>Dennison Woods, owner of Eldridge Woods funeral home in Wichita, sees the scope of the problem first-hand when preparing services for families who have lost loved ones to violence.</p>
<p>Woods said too many young people  &mdash;  young men in particular  &mdash;  fall for the temptations of fast living, look for respect in the wrong places, or get caught up in other people&rsquo;s problems.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Leads Nation in Per Capita Rate of Black Homicide Victimization</p>
<p>State&rsquo;s Black Homicide Rate of 36.86 Per 100,000 is Nearly Seven Times National Overall Homicide Rate of 5.38 per 100,000</p>
<p>Washington, DC  &mdash;  Pennsylvania leads the nation in the rate of black homicide victimization according to a new analysis of unpublished Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR) data released today by the Violence Policy Center (VPC). The annual study, Black Homicide Victimization in the United States: An Analysis of 2006 Homicide Data, uses 2006 data  &mdash;  the most recent data available from the FBI  &mdash;  and ranks the 50 states according to their black homicide victimization rates. The study found overwhelmingly that firearms, usually handguns, were the weapon of choice in the homicides. This is the third year that the VPC has issued the report and the second time in three years that Pennsylvania has topped the ranking.</p>
<p>The top five states with each state&rsquo;s corresponding black homicide victimization rate are: 1) Pennsylvania, 36.86 per 100,000; 2) Michigan, 33.40 per 100,000; 3) Indiana, 32.65 per 100,000; 4) Kansas, 32.47 per 100,000; and, 5) Nevada, 32.26 per 100,000.</p>
<p>Josh Sugarmann, VPC executive director and study co-author states, &#8220;While Pennsylvania has the highest rate of black homicide victimization, this is a crisis that is devastating black teens and adults across our nation. The key role played by guns in black homicide victimization cannot be denied and must be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>For PENNSYLVANIA, the study found that in 2006:</p>
<p>* There were 490 black homicide victims, resulting in a homicide rate of 36.86 per 100,000. Of these, 441 were male and 49 were female.</p>
<p>* For homicides in which the weapon used could be identified, 87 percent of black victims (414 out of 475) were killed with guns. Of these, 90 percent (372 victims) were known to be killed with handguns. There were 26 victims killed with firearms where the type of gun was not stated. There were 26 victims killed with knives or other cutting instruments, 17 victims killed by bodily force, and 8 victims killed by a blunt object.</p>
<p>* For homicides involving black victims for which the victim to offender relationship could be identified, 85 percent of black victims (173 out of 204) were murdered by someone they knew. Thirty-one victims were killed by strangers.</p>
<p>* For homicides involving black victims for which the circumstances could be identified, 56 percent (166 out of 298) were not related to the commission of any other felony. Of these, 86 percent (143 homicides) involved arguments between the victim and the offender.</p>
<p>For the entire UNITED STATES, the study found that in 2006:</p>
<p>* There were 7,425 black homicide victims in the United States. Of these, 6,383 (86 percent) were male, and 1,041 (14 percent) were female. Gender was not recorded for 1 victim.</p>
<p>* The homicide rate for black victims in the United States was 20.27 per 100,000. In comparison, the overall national homicide rate was 5.38 per 100,000 and the national homicide rate for whites was 3.14 per 100,000.</p>
<p>* For homicides in which the weapon used could be identified, 82 percent of black victims (5,722 out of 6,942) were killed with guns. Of these, 79 percent (4,501 victims) were killed with handguns. There were 671 victims killed with knives or other cutting instruments, 258 victims killed by bodily force, and 175 victims killed by a blunt object.</p>
<p>* For homicides in which the victim to offender relationship could be identified, 74 percent of black victims (2,607 out of 3,502) were murdered by someone they knew. Eight hundred ninety-five victims were killed by strangers.</p>
<p>* For homicides involving black victims for which the circumstances could be identified, 69 percent (3,081 out of 4,490) were not related to the commission of any other felony. Of these, 56 percent (1,721 homicides) involved arguments between the victim and the offender. Twelve percent (377 homicides) were reported to be gang-related. Forty-four percent of these (167 homicides) were in California, which may be in part due to more comprehensive reporting. In California, 45 percent of non-felony related homicides were reported to be gang-related.</p>
<p>The Violence Policy Center is a national non-profit educational foundation that conducts research on violence in America and works to develop violence-reduction policies and proposals. The Center examines the role of firearms in America, conducts research on firearms violence, and explores new ways to decrease firearm-related death and injury.<br>

			<p>The statistics are interesting: 86 percent involved an argument between the victim and the offender.</p>
<p>Why, oh why would anyone shoot an unknown stranger over a quarrel?  I was once nearly run off the road by a dingbat who thought my passing him on the left was &#8220;illegal&#8221; and that his possession of a mobile phone gave him the authority to &#8220;arrest&#8221; me for unspecified charges.  I had my .45&#8221; 1911A1, loaded with Winchester hollowpoints, and I did not pull it out.  I merely drove away.</p>
<p>I was also held up at gunpoint while working at Subway in 2004.  I didn&rsquo;t argue with the robber, and told my co-worker to behave herself.  It was only money, and the money was insured.  Even if had been MY money, I still wouldn&rsquo;t have fought for it.  The robber got away with just less than $250.  It doesn&rsquo;t take much of a gunshot injury to rack up that much in hospital bills.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pick fights.</p>

<p>No.  The key role played by blacks in black homcide victimization cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Majority White areas where gun ownership is commonplace (e.g., North and South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, West Virginia) have per capita homicide rates below the national average.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the inanimate object that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>

			<p>Most of this story, especially the parts that blame guns, read like they could have been published in The Onion.  Except for one scant mention by the Police Chief, we&rsquo;re not told anything about the kind of people killing black men and women.</p>
<p>Note that at one point, only 12 percent of these homicides are gang related.  Perhaps this is evidence rebutting the 80 percent story here on AR several days ago, which I doubted.  Most were merely arguments that turned into gunfire, because black men are so notorious for having low intelligence and high testosterone, meaning the have too little impulse control.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p><i>Woods said too many young people &mdash; young men in particular &mdash; fall for the temptations of fast living, look for respect in the wrong places, or get caught up in other people&rsquo;s problems.</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all good boys, honor roll students, who just happened to get caught up in the wrong crowd.  Who, pray tell, is the wrong crowd?</p>

<p>Well Im convinced. The proof is overwhelming. Take guns away and blacks will stop killing each other. No doubt they will stop killing whites as well. Black perpetrated rapes will end and all black teens will graduate from high school. It was those mean ol guns all along that was responsible for the VERY high black crime rate. Well thatts one less thing to worry abot. Problem solved. </p>

			<p>Thank you, liberal media, for blaming the 2nd Amendment for black-on-black homicides.</p>
<p>Thank you for telling us that blacks are dying- not because of other blacks- but from &#8220;gun violence&#8221;.</p>
<p>And in Haiti and Jamaica they die from &#8220;machete violence&#8221;.</p>

<p>Lol! Well said Mike. IT&rsquo;s all about the guns with these idiots. Forget about the guy at the Belgian day care center who killed multiple victims, icluding a baby with a knife. I am personally in favor of strong knife control legislation. While we&rsquo;re at it let&rsquo;s ban baseball bats as well.  As far as Black rape goes, well AMREN readers can use their imagination on that one. <br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll use illogic just like the typical liberal,demo-rat-ic Marxist; instead of &#8221; removing guns or make them all illegal &#8220;, let&rsquo;s remove all blacks or make them all illegal in America, that would solve this &#8221; black &#8221; problem also and have far less negative impact on the &#8221; rights &#8221; of law abiding citizens of all races, especially Original Euro-Americans.</p>

<p>Yes, and I&rsquo;m sure that most of the other homicide victims were Whites killed by Blacks, or Hispanics killed by Blacks or Hispanics.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with some of the posters here  &mdash;  guns are the problem, but only because they are in the hands of Blacks.  All you have to do is look at how dangerous and indiscriminate Black African soldiers and &#8216;rebels&rsquo; are with weapons to understand why a gun has no place in a Black person&rsquo;s possession.</p>
<p>We could never pass a rational law that prohibited Black gun ownership or possession because that would be &#8216;discriminatory&rsquo;, even though it would save tens of thousands of lives per year, so I guess the Marxists will use Black gun violence as an excuse to take away all of our guns so Blacks can be protected from themselves.</p>

			<p>The situation is much the same in Britain. However, due to UK gun laws, the common weapon and method used by urban black youths is a knife and a stab wound to the heart. The fact that the heart area is the target is an indicator that a fatal wound is the attacker&rsquo;s objective. Unfortunately, many of our courts and judges have not cottoned onto this fact when sentencing.<br>
I&rsquo;ve lost track of how many blacks have been stabbed in London in the last 12 months - around 40, I think. The most recent being a young black father on his way to maternity hospital to visit his wife, the murder being witnessed by his 3 year-old daughter at a bus stop. London is not the safest place to be nowadays. The further one strays from the Green-Zoned seats of power - including Westminster and Buckingham Palace, the more dangerous life becomes.<br>
Homicide committed by blacks is,  as they say,  a global problem. Unfortunately anyone who points out this fact is committing political suicide. Hence, the bloodshed continues and worsens.  </p>

			<p>I live in a Right To Carry State and even though I do not carry a WEAPON I can tell you this, WHEN blacks (usually two or more) put the evil eye on me, all I do is SMILE and slip my hand into my pocket. ? They always turn and move on very quickly. Knowing that honest, law abiding citizens Have The Right to protect themselves is all they need to know, to forget ME as their victim?</p>

			<p>Self control and reasoned approach to life could be of value to these people.  Not emotional outrage over &#8220;everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stupid, dumbed down people, who are constantly sociopathic, they are the problem, not the gun.</p>
<p>Of course bust a cap, swing a machete, kick someone&rsquo;s head, some people just limit out mentally on these things.  It&rsquo;s inherent.</p>

<p>Your point is very moot. Blacks who are commiting homicides are getting their guns illegally. Whether it&rsquo;s from Mexico, the black market, or robbing a gun store. Taking away guns from blacks who legal payed for them is simply going to make law abiding blacks defenseless against the criminals in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I lived in black neighborhood for four years and went to a black school and trust me blacks dont like gangs and criminals anymore than you do.</p>

<p>Well the official policy is, that blacks are only concerned with the misstreatment of black criminals. It&rsquo;s the darn &#8216;elites&rsquo; again. I suspect this reality is also true, because among all people of color, they know that these acts take place in greater proportion against the white &#8216;oppressors&rsquo;, and this is why they chose the side of the criminal so oftne/as a given. </p>

<p>I saw a thing on the BBC website (which actually surprised me being so P.C.) about all the knife killings in London. What struck me was how so very many of them were black and so were almost all of the killers. There were very few White (what should really be just called British) victims or killers. There were a few Whites who had been killed by blacks but none in reverse. The killing was overwhelmingly done by blacks and entirerly so when it was inter-racial. Looking at all the mugshots I couldn&rsquo;t help shaking my head in utter disbelief. THIS WAS ENGLAND? ..too bad you guys didn&rsquo;t listen to Enoch Powell (who wanted to be bothered listening to some kook when it was all groovy in swinging London?) and kept voting for the Labour party.</p>

I strongly disagree. I think violent black and hispanic males are &#8220;shock troopers&#8221; who operate with the sanction of the rest of their community.  Violent blacks operate with the idea of getting back at whites, and violent hispanics operate as &#8220;invasionary&#8221; soldiers to eventually take over the US.  Look at the &#8220;gang moms,&#8221; women in their 30s and 40s who have one or more children in gangs, and who allow entire gangs to operate out of their houses.  That&rsquo;s not exactly a sign that the older memebers of the community &#8220;don&rsquo;t like gangs.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Black Homicide Victimization - they&rsquo;re hoping if they leave the facts about perpetrators hidden that people will just assume whites are doing the killing. It really is amusing to watch the intellectual contortion liberals have to engage in to keep the scope of black criminality out of view - even though everybody outside of a social science classroom can clearly see the problem right in front of their eyes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Quemadmoeum gladis nemeinum, occidit, occitendis telum est&#8221; (&#8220;A sword is never a killer, it&rsquo;s a tool in the killer&rsquo;s hands&#8221;)</p>
<p>                      &mdash;  - M.T. Seneca</p>
<p>When someone of another race kills a Bantu, the Bantus scream and foam at the mouth and yell &#8220;racism&#8221;. See the Billey Joe Johnson story.</p>
<p>When Bantus are killing Bantus - especially with guns- then Bantus wring their hands and call for more gun control. The gun gets blamed, not the shooter.</p>
<p>If blacks used machetes or garrotes to kill one another, would Bantus be calling for machete or garrote control? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
