<h1>Morris Brown&rsquo;s Water &#8216;Will Keep Flowing&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gayle Wahite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Morris Brown College still has water. &#8220;It will keep flowing,&#8221; vowed interim president Stanley Pritchett on Tuesday after the historic black college scored an extension on a deadline to pay its past-due bills in full or lose its water service.</p>
<p>School officials paid Atlanta Watershed Management $150,000 Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The college has paid a total of $250,000 and agreed to pay the remaining $65,000 within 30 days, Watershed Management Commissioner Robert Hunter said in a statement after receiving the payment. &#8220;We are glad that Morris Brown can remain open and continue its reorganization efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>School officials said donations had come in from board members, faculty, staff, alumni and students.</p>
<p>Students raised $6,000 Tuesday by stopping cars to ask for money, Pritchett said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As officials scrambled to avert the loss of water on campus, they faced a new lawsuit in Fulton Superior Court over claims of another unpaid bill.</p>
<p>General Electric Capital Corp. filed suit Monday against the college for $382,355 plus legal fees, alleging breach of contract for failing to keep up payments on a dozen pieces of office equipment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pritchett estimated that the college needs about $1.5 million to settle immediate debts, and $30 million to ensure its longer term survival.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re reading here that Atlanta Watershed and GE Capital are both after this school for unpaid bills.  What of their commitment to diversity?  How racist of them not to let them have office equipment and water for free, after all they&rsquo;re just victims of centuries worth of slavery, barring that they&rsquo;d be Harvard by now.  GE Capital just got a lot of TARP money from Uncle Sap, I&rsquo;m surprised that the liberal Democrats that run all these House and Senate committees aren&rsquo;t whining.  How awful it would be if the students of Morris Brown weren&rsquo;t able to take showers, and if the administrators weren&rsquo;t able to fax each other jokes and lunch menus.</p>

			<p>Usually colleges receive a lot of money from their alumni to cover exspenses. These colleges either are not producing highly succesful alumni or the black alumni does believe in giving back. Black people are not known for giving to charirty even when its for them.</p>

			<p>Ha!! Affirmative action and the never ceasing push for diversity on college campuses has depleted the potential student pool for black colleges.  No one will admit this, but why are black colleges everywhere in financial straits?  If a black kid knows he can get in at (insert big name school here) why go to Morris Brown, or Howard?  Talk about wanting cake and eating it too, trying to maintain historically black colleges while sending black kids to politically correct State U.  </p>

			<p>Not to worry, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a bailout for this HBC hidden in Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;stimulus&#8221; package. This is what happens when blacks are in charge. But one thing is for certain, you can ALWAYS count on whitey to bail them out. ALWAYS&hellip;</p>

This same thing happens here with community centers.</p>
<p>Blacks demand and get their own community centers, using the argument (or is it threat?) that they need these centers to stop the violence. No matter how many they have, they want more but they don&rsquo;t seem to do anything to curtail violence in black communities. (BTW, shootings and stabbings often occur in and around these &#8216;safe havens&rsquo;)</p>
<p>Anyway, once a year, the media reports on a black community center that hasn&rsquo;t paid their electric, or gas, or water bill in some outrageously long period and now the center is under threat of being closed. All the players are stymied as to why the bill wasn&rsquo;t paid, who&rsquo;s responsible, and what they&rsquo;re going to do now.</p>
<p>Of course, the city always comes up with the funds. After all, any violence committed is directly linked to these centers not getting enough funding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clique of a stereotype of a parody.<br>

<p>This is also true here in South Carolina. Anything having the word &#8220;community&#8221; in it, is black and troublesome.</p>

<p>George Atkinson, the thug safety for the Oakland Raiders, played football at Morris Brown. I don&rsquo;t think Morris Brown has a football team now, but he&rsquo;s the only football player to come from that school.</p>
