<h1>Next Step: Sainthood</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Webster, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> February 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every organ of cultural influence  &mdash;  the media, Hollywood, the music industry, churches, academia  &mdash;  is giddy over Barack Obama, whom they have made into a combination of Abraham Lincoln, Princess Diana, Elvis, and even a touch of Jesus Christ. Mr. Obama is the nation&rsquo;s first super-star president, and his ascendancy has all the hallmarks of celebrity: cult-like followers, fawning media, and expert &#8220;brand management.&#8221; The adulation was bad enough when Mr. Obama won the election; it reached a climax on Inauguration Day.</p>
<p>The entertainment industry flocked to Washington for the swearing-in. Musicians who would never let a Republican even play their music, much less perform for one, fought over slots in a free concert on the National Mall on Sunday, two days before the great event. Among the performers were Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, U2, Beyonce, Bon Jovi and Garth Brooks. Between sets, the audience heard &#8220;inspirational&#8221; readings by celebrities such as Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Jack Black, and Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>Yet more celebrities had front row seats at the inauguration and gushed about the experience. Actress Susan Sarandon on Mr. Obama: &#8220;He is a community organizer like Jesus was. And now, we&rsquo;re a community and he can organize us.&#8221; Actor Alan Cumming: &#8220;He&rsquo;s like Gandhi or something. He&rsquo;s got that powerful, soulful thing in him.&#8221; Actress Anne Hathaway: &#8220;I was there at the Mall. [It was] the feeling of millions of people all there sending positive energy and having hope together.&#8221; Actress Ellen Burstyn: &#8220;It&rsquo;s the end of a shameful history of our relationship to African-Americans.&#8221; Black actress Alfre Woo-dard: &#8220;I think we might finally grow up as a nation.&#8221; Black PBS commentator John Ridley: &#8220;Obama is the more perfect union. He is a house united.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [J]ust by virtue of his being, Obama is America, and the first true American to lead our nation.&#8221; Black poet Maya Angelou, who re-cited doggerel at William Clinton&rsquo;s inauguration: &#8220;We needed him. And out of that great need Barack Obama came.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House did nothing to discourage any of this. On Inauguration Day, its home page ran a huge portrait of Mr. Obama, with the banner headline: &#8220;CHANGE HAS COME <i>to</i> AMERICA.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Washington, DC public schools announced well in advance that they would declare a holiday on Inauguration Day. The district hardly had a choice: Huge numbers of black teachers and students would have skipped school anyway. Not to be lacking in piety, schools in suburban Maryland and Virginia also closed to let students experience the event. Needless to say, there were no school closings for George Bush&rsquo;s inauguration.</p>
<p>The University of Virginia managed to stay open but suspended classes for three hours during the ceremony and set up big-screen televisions in the basketball arena. Provost Arthur Garson, Jr. explained that it was to let students &#8220;participate in this exercise in democracy.&#8221; When it was pointed out that the university had never suspended classes for an &#8220;exercise in democracy&#8221; before, campus PR flack Carol Wood explained that there had been great interest in the election among young people and that &#8220;students told us they wanted to hear live  &mdash;  with their friends  &mdash;  what President-elect Obama would have to say in his inaugural address.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress announced an unprecedented project of collecting videos and recordings of sermons preached during inauguration week. The center is a public collection that includes interviews after such national turning points as the Pearl Harbor and September 11 attacks. The head of the Folklife Center explained that &#8220;if a historian asks &#8216;How did Americans react to Obama&rsquo;s inauguration?&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have immediate responses to this powerful event.&#8221; Bishop Gregory Palmer was to preach at Foundry United Methodist Church, which President Clinton and his family at-tended. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a moment of great adulation, joy and accomplishment for all persons in this nation, whether they voted for the president-elect or not,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most astonishing bit of adulation took place on January 6. Even before Mr. Obama had served a single day in the Oval Office, liberal New York Congressman Jose Serrano introduced a bill to repeal the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which limits the president to two terms.</p>
<p>The inauguration was distinguished by some things that did not happen. For 38 years, the city of Alexandria, just across the Potomac from Washington, has let the United Daughters of the Confederacy fly Confederate flags on January 19 in celebration of Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s birthday. This year, city manager James Hartmann explained that Alexandria was too busy with &#8220;inaugural traffic and crowd control, access and security issues,&#8221; and would permit no Confederate flag-flying. The real reason, of course, was that pro-Obama sentiment had to be allowed to sweep all before it.</p>
<p>The Obama &#8220;brand&#8221; is now so strong that businesses have tied themselves to it. Corporations usually steer clear of appearing to favor a party or candidate for fear of losing customers whose politics differ, but businessmen are in full swoon, just like celebrities and academics. Given their liberal customer base, hippie Vermont ice cream makers Ben and Jerry probably lost no sales because of their Obama-themed offering, &#8220;Yes, Pecan.&#8221; The same is true for yuppie-oriented Ikea with its &#8220;Embrace Change&#8221; campaign, upscale soft-drink company Jones Soda and its &#8220;Orange You Glad for Change Cola,&#8221; and coffee giant Starbuck&rsquo;s offer of free lattes to people who volunteered for Mr. Obama&rsquo;s community service program. But Southwest Airlines may loose customers who don&rsquo;t appreciate its &#8220;Yes you can&#8221; promotion, and donut maker Krispi Kreme could make enemies with its free inaugural donut giveaway. Pepsi has changed its logo to resemble the &#8220;O&#8221; logo from the Obama campaign, and is trying to piggyback on Obama mania with its &#8220;Refresh Our Nation&#8221; campaign. Its pre-inaugural ads called Mr. Obama &#8220;the man who is about to refresh our nation,&#8221; and like Southwest Airlines, it also is pushing a &#8220;Yes you can&#8221; theme.</p>
<p>Madison Avenue is scrambling to find black models who look like First Daughters Sasha and Malia, and the maker of Beanie Baby toys is selling Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia dolls. The Obama Victory Plate went on sale shortly after the election. For $19.99, you could &#8220;own a piece of history&#8221;  &mdash;  a dinner plate with a color portrait of &#8220;our first African American commander in chief&#8221; that fully captured his &#8220;confident smile and kind eyes.&#8221; Something called the National Collector&rsquo;s Mint was hawking the Official Obama Lincoln Coin for $19.95 (Lincoln on one side, Mr. Obama on the other). Clad in 71 mg of .999 fine silver, this &#8220;non-circulation Liberian legal tender&#8221; comes complete with serial numbered certificate of authenticity. Says one happy purchaser, &#8220;Barack has opened my eyes and made me believe that anything is possible. It&rsquo;s a feeling I want to hold on to and the Obama coin is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are Obama coffee mugs, ties, and T-shirts, Obama silk jackets and earrings, a commemorative Obama mantelpiece clock, and even a Napa Valley 2005 Merlot bottled as Obama Limited Special Reserve. Budweiser advertized its new American Ale as &#8220;Inuagur ale,&#8221; and the new president even has his own &#8220;action figure,&#8221; courtesy of the unfortunately named Jailbreak Toys.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has risen to new heights as the guest star in Marvel Comics&rsquo; Amazing Spider-Man Number 583, in which an evil villain tries to disrupt the inauguration. Spider-Man foils the plot and earns a &#8220;fist bump&#8221; from the grateful president. The first edition of the comic sold out within hours, and the company quickly ran through two more printings of what it expects to be the best-selling comic in decades. Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada, insists he would have produced a presidential comic book for a John McCain victory, if the Republican had been a Spider-Man fan like Mr. Obama.</p>
<p>Obama-huckstering has grown so intense that government lawyers are trying to contain it. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki says they want to &#8220;protect the presidential image while being careful not to squelch the overwhelming enthusiasm that the public has for the president.&#8221;</p>
<p>Viral marketing is a new advertising technique that broadcasts videos, images, and messages on Internet social networking sites. David Axelrod, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s chief strategist, used viral marketing very effectively during the campaign, and appears to have plans to use it to whoop the new administration. Shortly after the inauguration, a video began circulating of Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Cameron Diaz, and others pledging their devotion to the new president. Their puppy-dog adoration is eerie and cultish, and would be called &#8220;Nazi&#8221; if a Republican had inspired it.</p>
<p>All this prostration before the altar of Obama cries out for ridicule, but gag writers and comedians insist there isn&rsquo;t anything funny about the man. He&rsquo;s too cool and too wonderful to parody. In fact, the media are parodying themselves.</p>
<p>In the Washington, DC radio market, there is one 24-hour FM news station, WTOP. After the election, it declared itself the &#8220;Inauguration Station&#8221; and breathlessly counted down the days to January 20. Almost every day it aired fawning interviews with officials from the inaugural committee and incoming administration. After the inauguration, WTOP started a new series, The First Hundred Days, which is a daily recap of what The Great Man did for us today. It sounds like Radio Pyongyang worshipping Kim Jong-il, whose birth is said to have been marked by the appearance of a new star.</p>
<p>Cable station MSNBC now acts like the broadcast arm of the Obama administration. One of its hosts, Chris Matthews, said he felt a &#8220;thrill going up&#8221; his leg after an Obama speech, and MSNBC joined Star-buck&rsquo;s to broadcast inauguration coverage at 650 coffee shops. MSNBC also piped its feed to movie theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston, Washington, and 14 other major cities. NBC anchor Brian Williams told late-night talk-show host David Letterman that Mr. Obama was the first positive presidential choice &#8220;after a line of what the ordinary voter would maybe describe as bad choices or choices of evils, for years, generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, both ABC and NBC will release special-edition collectors&rsquo; DVDs of their inauguration broadcasts. CBS will give away 50 camcorders  &mdash;  to a person in each state  &mdash;  so he can record how President Obama&rsquo;s first 100 days are transforming his community. Clips from the videos will air on the CBS Evening News. CNN is hawking inauguration T-shirts it calls &#8220;some of the most historic shirts money can buy.&#8221; One reads: &#8220;Obama raises hand, lifts a nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <cite>New York Times</cite>, <cite>Washington Post,</cite> and other newspapers are selling commemorative copies of inauguration issues. <cite>Time</cite> and <cite>Newsweek</cite> also put out inauguration editions stuffed with puff and flattering photos. A sample sentiment from <cite>Newsweek:</cite> &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s win has set the stage for a newly defined American masculinity  &mdash;  one based on reason and sanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing in <cite>Vanity Fair,</cite> former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers crowned Barack Obama the &#8220;most famous living person in the history of the world.&#8221; She is probably right. Even before taking office, he had schools and streets named after him, and soon a mountain in the Caribbean island of Antigua will bear his name. This unprecedented idolatry is wholly out of place for a republic founded on laws, not men  &mdash;  and especially not celebrities.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090215/Obama.Letters/">New E-Book Captures Kids&rsquo; Hopes, Dreams for Obama</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>AP, February 15, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thousands of kids detailed their hopes and expectations for President Barack Obama in letters and drawings as part of a worldwide project, with 150 chosen for a free e-book being released on Presidents Day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anthony Pape, 10, of DuBois, Pa., offered: &#8220;I hope that we will have no war ever again. I mean why are we fighting why can&rsquo;t we all be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seven-year-old Aaron Van Blerkom&rsquo;s letter was simpler  &mdash;  but no less problematic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Obama,&#8221; the Pasadena, Calif., first-grader began, &#8220;Please Make it rain candy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Dear Mr. President&#8221; project was a joint effort between the National Education Association and kidthing.com, which is putting out the book for use with its downloadable media player. A special hardcopy edition of the book will be sent to the White House for Obama, who has done wonders to bring the office of the presidency to life for young people.</p>
<p>The letters were written in January amid Obama-mania at inauguration time as schools scrambled to bus kids to special viewing events and come up with computer screens and TVs for them to watch in classrooms and auditoriums.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawrence Hitchcock, chief executive officer of the Web site, said more than 4,500 letters were considered for the book on a heart-wrenching range of topics that don&rsquo;t stop at an end to the war and climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had, &#8216;My dad&rsquo;s out of work, fix the company, please get more jobs,&rsquo; Hitchcock said. &#8220;There were Latino kids saying, &#8216;Please change the immigration laws so my dad can come back from Mexico.&rsquo; This is a profound snapshot of a social narrative of young kids during an important moment in history. It really kind of stunned us what came in through the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very proud because I know he&rsquo;ll be able to make a change in the country and we&rsquo;ll be a lot more happier,&#8221; Destiny [Destiny McLaurin, a sixth-grader from Medford, N.Y] said. &#8220;I think he should make people feel more welcome, people who don&rsquo;t really get along with other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aaron&rsquo;s wish is a little more specific. If Obama makes candy drop from the sky, he&rsquo;s hoping for his favorite: candy canes! And if the president showed up at his school, he&rsquo;d have these requests:</p>
<p>&#8220;Make fires and earthquakes not exist. Make no tornadoes or any of those things that break things.&#8221;</p>
<p>An 11-year-old boy from Ohio drew himself in tears at the side of a relative. His dream, he wrote, is that a &#8220;cure for cancer will be found&#8221; with Obama in the White House, &#8220;Because it took my aunt to a better place on father&rsquo;s day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another child drew Obama as the &#8220;new sunrise of America.&#8221; One made Earth and labeled it &#8220;Obamaland,&#8221; and still another created the president&rsquo;s face as half dark and half light skin tones with the words: &#8220;United We Are One.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Let the cult flourish, I say. When his socialist, anti-White agenda fails due to his horrendous economic policies (and it will most certainly fail) perhaps all the &#8220;hopes&#8221; and &#8220;dreams&#8221; that American leftists have invested in him will be exposed for what they are, and help true Americans to fight back the tide of liberalism and multiculturalism. </p>

			<p>Krispy Kreme ought to worry more about its own business than gushing over Obama.  There are some that think The Kreme could go bankrupt in 2009, mainly because of overexpansion and Atkins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so ironic that this mint is offering a silver coin with Obama&rsquo;s visage, because President Obama just signed a porkulus bill that belies the fiscal responsibility and monetary soundness that a silver coin represents.</p>
<p>This article mentions NBC.  I happened to have the TV on the broadcast NBC (not MSNBC) at the point when the networks were able to project that Obama went over the top, with the closing of the polls in CA, WA and OR, that being 10 PM Central Time.  Once the lead anchor at the time (don&rsquo;t think it was Brian Williams) announced that Obama went over 270, several members of the newsroom were heard clapping.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I wonder what&rsquo;s going to happen to all this euphoria if, in four years, the economy is in the tank, and Obama loses his bid for re-election.</p>

<p>LOL, I actually bought one of those for laughs. It never fails to make my friends crack a rib laughing whenever they come into my home and see it on display.</p>

			<p>There was a similar media hype for Nelson Mandella after he was elected and apartied dismantled. After South Africa took a twenty year slide into anarchy, destitution, and murder/rape all the media types, all the newspaper men, all the left wing writers who had lived in South Africa their whole lives, simply picked up their families and moved to Australia and the US.<br>
    These Media and Entertainment Moguls are great at tearing down a society but when they have to live in a society they themselves were instrumental (no pun) in establishing they are packing the wagons and leaving to find another country to tear apart.</p>

			<p>Instead of gauging the media and Hollywood who are fawning over him, why not ask a real person in the street and get a real unbiased opinion?  That will never happen of course.  I know when my parents watch TV and he&rsquo;s doing some community service commercial, they hit the mute button because they can&rsquo;t stand the sound of his voice.  I was having my vehicle serviced at a dealership two weeks ago and I went into the customer lounge to wait.  The TV was on the CNN channel.  Every few minutes it was Obama this or Obama that and then showing clips of him speaking somewhere.  Finally someone got up and asked if they could change the channel because they were sick of all the media coverage and quite a few people agreed.  I think the real reason the media is ga-ga over him because there is a sense that the majority of people, even some that voted for him, don&rsquo;t have a high opinion of him and they are trying to change that perception.    </p>

			<p>It is indeed amazing to behold all this adulation, especially since it concerns such a mediocre talent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see how all this is going to play out if Obama&rsquo;s administration flops badly in trying to get the economy back on track.  Will they still exalt him and place the blame on something or someone else?  I&rsquo;m referring to the moderate whites and not the addle-minded celebrities and the far left kooks, of course, who are stricken with some kind of mental abberation that&rsquo;s probably incurable.</p>
<p>The economy could cause violent tax revolts and inter-tribal warfare that will put an end to this nation as we know, and I&rsquo;d be hard pressed to see him get through such turmoil unscathed.</p>
<p>What strikes me most about him is that he speaks of deep doom and gloom that probably will get worse, yet he&rsquo;s very non-chalant about it all, sometimes laughing and making jokes as if this entire affair is just a game, which would be the attitude one would expect from the average black who cares nothing for this country really, and doesn&rsquo;t truly understand the gravity of very serious situations when he is confronted with them. </p>
<p>I have a feeling if he ever finally gets caught up in the severity of the situation and makes bad decisions under pressure he&rsquo;s going to show a very ghetto-type side of himself his adorers have never seen before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure it will matter to the most severe cases, but I&rsquo;m positive that will be the end of him.<br>

			<p>Yes Obama is truly a miracle worker. Since he was elected the dow has dropped 2000 points. Sine he signed the stimulus package the dow has dropped 300 points.Soon america will become a paradise like Zimbabwe who has thousands of billionaires.Too bad it cost at least 1 Billion dollars in Zimbabwe dollars to buy a loaf of bread.If you can find one for sale.</p>

I found myself chuckling, then laughing, I thought I was reading a vicious satire from the NATIONAL LAMPOON or THE ONION, alas I am too cynical and sardonic but to enjoy this article.</p>
<p>Soon the blind will see, the cripples will walk and 4th generation welfare recipients will get a job, thanks to the second coming of Saint Obama!<br>

			<p>Noam Chomsky has already declared Barack Obama a war criminal and states that his foreign policy will be much worse than the previous Bush adminstration. </p>
<p>Ordinary Iranians have already burnt him in effgy. </p>
<p>Some good news:considering what a complete disaster George W Bush was and the fact that John McCain had no economic program, why was the race so close? Also there were millions of Native born White Americans who did not vote. </p>
<p>Peter Brimelow thinks that the solution is for the Republican party to to take a hard stance against immigration. This is infantile thinking. The Republican party is owned by the corporations. It is a infantile dream to beleive that the Republican party will ever come out against immigration. Let the Republican party die. Trying to revive it is monumentally foolish. </p>
<p>The question is: how much longer will Native born White Americans give their allegiance to a political system that hates them? What would have to take place to create a new political reality? </p>
<p>I believe that the propaganda is so over the top and vicious because our enemy understands a White backlash would bring this nonesense to a crashing end. They are terrified of a possible White backlash. </p>
<p>The Chinese,Russians,Iraqis, Irans and Venezuelans will stand up to Barack Obama.</p>

			<p>Check out this OBAMA racist site.</p>
<p>Pretty scary to read if you are white.</p>

			<p>To Mr Webster,</p>
<p>There was much written in this article, that was dead on accurate about the cult of Obama; probably, the most pithy point being this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shortly after the inauguration, a video began circulating of Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Cameron Diaz, and others pledging their devotion to the new president. Their puppy-dog adoration is eerie and cultish, and would be called &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; if a Republican had inspired it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what is really &#8220;new&#8221; about this black &#8220;magic&#8221; worship by America&rsquo;s white elite and their lower grade leftist lemmings in the general population, other than that it revolves around a political figure and not a media personality? In tone and style, how is it different from the Cosbymania or the Oprahgasims of the 80s and 90s? </p>
<p>The answer is that, it isn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>It all revolves around the &#8220;idea&#8221; that because the media presents a favorable image of blacks in a largely fictionalized microcosm, that this will and should be generalized, to all blacks in the societal macrocosm as well. This is with not only a total disregard for the realities of the situation, but an outright contempt for the whites who will most readily suffer within those realities. After all, who cares about a 10-year-old white girl being gang-raped by a mob of blacks, or her father being murdered prior to that by them, if we can build a Multi Cult rainbow society, just like that fanciful &#8220;I&rsquo;d Like To Buy The World A Coke&#8221; commercial, from the 1970s?</p>
<p>And of course, with much adherence to the modern Hollywood &#8220;morality&#8221; dictates, if it doesn&rsquo;t become a &#8220;reality,&#8221; it can all be brushed aside as a testimonial to the American people&rsquo;s &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can already see this simmering under the expectantly maudlin surface of the impending failure of Comrade Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;change,&#8221; as he forces through his abjectly outdated and abhorrently inflationary &#8220;stimulus&#8221; package. Print, print, print; and spend, spend, spend, irregardless of how worthless the dollar becomes. </p>
<p>Now that is what I call textbook &#8220;change,&#8221; with just a dash of &#8220;hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s nauseating.  To think that the names Louis Pasteur, Alexander Fleming, or Hilary Koprowski are unknown compared to this overblown, self-absorbed Socialist.  We&rsquo;ll all be getting the last laugh here on Amren within a year or two.  Maybe less.  That&rsquo;s when I predict that the feathers will be off the chicken and these hysterical groupies will be left with a memory of an unsustainable and empty hallucination.  No man is that valuable.  Well, maybe those in the medical profession but how often do we ever worship someone in that field?  Or anyone of true human value?  Never.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s good looking (he&rsquo;s not ugly, but good looking he&rsquo;s not).  I don&rsquo;t think he talks that well but I guess he does talk very well for a black man.  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s that bright.  He&rsquo;s surrounded by brighter people.  But I do give him credit for one thing.  Manipulation.  Oh, is he so very, very good at that (most career politicians are).  But he&rsquo;s not at fault.  The fault lies with those that allow themselves to be manipulated, no matter what the reason.  He is a darker and classier version of Bill Clinton.<br>

			<p>I love movies, but no one should ever listen to what actors have to say about any topic besides acting. They either lack grey matter or they&rsquo;re campaigning for their next role &amp; can&rsquo;t afford to alienate producers.  Lord only knows all the nonsense they need to spout to get their shiny awards.  </p>
<p>For us normal folks, though, Obama-Worship has made working with liberals even more awkward than usual.  Thank God the inauguration has passed.  He has nowhere to go but down.   </p>

			<p>I was teaching at a very old college in Tennessee and found myself in president&rsquo;s office on a Friday afternoon. After our meeting was over, he asked me what I thought about the Alabama-Tennessee football game. My answer was&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the score?&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed a bit shocked. He said I was a dummy&hellip;.&#8221;the football game is tomorrow!!&#8221;</p>
<p>He said&hellip;.&#8221;Everyone in Tenessee knows the Alabama game is tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him&hellip;.&#8221;I really do not keep up with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said&hellip;.&#8221;Hell, everyone else does. There is no one in Tennessee that does not know the game is tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him&hellip;.&#8221;I am sure it seems like that when you are caught up in the excitement of the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started to get annoyed with me and said&hellip;.&#8221;The stadium at the University of Tennessee holds 80,000 people and it will be full.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I left, I told him&hellip;.&#8221;There are over 5 million Tennesseans&hellip; so one out of every 65 Tennesseans will be at the game, if all the spectators are from Tennessee.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it is with rock music, or football, or basketball, or hip hop, or bass fishing, or marathon running, or religious observances. One could get the impression the whole world is involved and yet only a small fraction even notice the event.<br>

			<p><i>Black actress Alfre Woo-dard: &ldquo;I think we might finally grow up as a nation.&rdquo;<i></i></i></p>
<p>That has got to be the smarmiest statement in the entire article, and of course it comes from a pampered black actress. I guess this nation became the world&rsquo;s foremost economic superpower and a beacon for success seeking people all over the world by being &#8220;childish.&#8221; It certainly managed to give this probably talentless actress a fair measure of success, and I suspect she has no desire to go and live anywhere else, especially not Africa.</p>

			<p>Mr. Webster is right, the whole thing should be parodied, and we all know why it can&rsquo;t. They place an insanely over-rated political goober above criticism, a place not even God has seen in the last two hundred years, and then call him the savior of DEMOCRACY&hellip;and no one gets the joke.</p>
<p>What this boils down to is, even it they were allowed to parody the man, in an age of absurdities, like the one we&rsquo;re in now, the parody would so resemble the reality as to be unrecognizable as parody. </p>

<p>If they don&rsquo;t get what they want, they will keep coming, and THEN, steamroll over every black person they can and every white person too and keep going until they get what they want.</p>

			<p>That article was spot-on accurate&hellip;until perhaps three days after the grand coronation/inaugeration. I see abundant evidence that the bloom is coming off this particular &#8220;rose&#8221; at a breakneck pace! Even some media bigmouths who were giddy only weeks ago are already expressing scepticism, though they are careful not to sound too critical, of course. Still, it is undeniable - as the economy continues to tank, jobs disappear, bank accounts and 401K&rsquo;s dry up, protracted and pointless wars drag on(even as thousands of fresh troops are sent to Afghanistan for God only knows what reason), and Americans struggle to make sense of what the Hell has happened to their allagedly happy, proseperous country in just a few months time, Obama&rsquo;s star is already fading! Reality is unforgiving that way&hellip; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting the over-arching mania is over by any stretch. But this Emperor&rsquo;s clothes seem to be falling off in record time!</p>

There have been a couple incidents in which minorities have stood up at town-hall meetings and praised Obama as if he was a great African chief with the power to grant their wishes.</p>
<p>The parallels to the stereotype of &#8216;the great African Big Chief&rsquo; is disturbing. It&rsquo;s a far cry from &#8216;ask not what your country can do for you&hellip;&rsquo;:</p>

			<p>I swear for the life of me I cannot understand the cult of personality and slavering adoration for this bland, boring, empty suit who had accomplished exactly nothing before becoming president.</p>
<p>I too hit the mute button on the TV whenever I see obama getting ready to (yet again) blather on and on about absolutely nothing.  I find him neither intelligent nor knowledgeable.  His empty rhetoric is not profound or lofty but full of empty promises that he in no way will be able to keep.</p>
<p>From The Wall Street Journal article, &#8220;Deficits Restrict Obama as His Promises Come Due:&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;during his election campaign, Obama made 510 promises, many of them requiring vast new expenditures&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;All of you who are anticipating an Obama catastrophe are probably deluding yourselves. </p>
<p>They [the media] will make sure he succeeds&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mr. Sowell writes:  The Economy Wins Every Time.</p>
<p>Government economic stimuli do not work  &mdash;  they didn&rsquo;t work during The Depression (prolonging the misery) and they didn&rsquo;t work in Japan in the 90s.</p>
<p>As biased and moronic as the MSM is, let&rsquo;s see how they spin it when the economy is flooded with an ocean of counterfeit money (due to the porkulus bill) causing a runaway inflation. Remember: The economic illiterates in the media fully support this ridiculous plan, with little to no criticism allowed.</p>
<p>As Tony pointed out above, the Dow slipped another 300 points right AFTER the &#8216;stimulus&rsquo; fraud package was signed. What great confidence Wall Street is anticipating!  The media can only cover up so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Chinese, Russians, Iraqis, Iranians and Venezuelans will stand up to Barack Obama&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Jupiter at 7:30 PM on February 17 </p>
<p>Yes, I think they&rsquo;ll eat him alive (as the Russians did JFK). I believe they buy none of this messiah nonsense, see through his thin veneer and know that he is weak and vulnerable, especially the Iranians and Russians.  I imagine the Russians and Venezuelans are happily anticipating the demise of the US economy and possible civil unrest.  They won&rsquo;t have to wait long.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m getting ready to buy a brand new 1 oz. gold coin to add to my collection.  Like Robert, I believe the price of gold is being kept artificially low for reasons unknown  &mdash;  but I fully expect gold to either shoot way up in price very soon OR be confiscated by the USG.  Hide your gold well (and not in a bank safety deposit box).  Guns too.</p>

The media will try to do everything they can to protect Obama but will lose any credibility they have left trying to do so.  <br>
Anyone with even a basic understanding of economic theory can tell you that the stimulus will be an utter failure.  There is only so much the media can cover up. (Seriously, it&rsquo;s going to get bad; start stocking up on canned food and ammo now, and start converting your cash savings into gold or silver coins - I&rsquo;m not kidding).<br>
Everyone should save a copy of this article.  Let all of these companies know that you aren&rsquo;t doing business with them ever again and keep your word.  </p>

			<p>Oh boy! I said at the very beginnig of his campaign he had a shot but I never really expected him to win. No matter how well he carried himself in a speech, I just couldn&rsquo;t concieve a Black gaining enough momentum to carry himself over the top. When we got near the end and it was so very close, then the economic downturn hit - unfortunately in the last 6 weeks before the election on Bush&rsquo;s watch - I knew it was Obama&rsquo;s to win and McCain&rsquo;s to loose.<br>
What I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for was the millions of glazed-over, glassy-eyed Whites who were in a strange stupor and at hundreds of other places to watch &#8220;the countdown&#8221; election night. To see that many guilt-ridden Whites who had drank the Koolaid and by sheer numbers had the political punch to put this inexperienced radical in office was just too much for me. I was in a depressed state for several days.<br>
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;ll take the country to suffer under him badly for these frosted over drunken Obamakins to wake up. I firmly believe he&rsquo;ll be a one-term president.

			<p>When the catastrophe enfolds us, and it will, how will we get rid of him? He&rsquo;s been elected for a term of four years. The democrat congress won&rsquo;t vote to impeach no matter what. So, he will have four years to do damage and should there be armed rebellion he&rsquo;ll ruthlessly suppress it with a military that is led by PC generals. In fact, rebellion will give him the excuse to &#8220;temporarily&#8221; suspend the elections of 2010 or 2012. I see no hope.</p>

			<p>  Save us, save us messiah Obama! Liberals have made Obama into a cult-like savior. They have projected all their fantasies onto this man. No human being can possibly live up to their crazy expectations. It&rsquo;s time to come down to earth. President Obama is a good family man, a bright fellow who means well but his misguided economic policies will only accelerate the decline of the United States.</p>

			<p>The American vidiots have been prepared for this scenario by a series of Hollywood Blacks over many years.  The Black computer whizzes, scientists, kindly old folks, honest cops, heroes, teachers, ad infinitum, have implanted in many a White brain the idea that Blacks are the solution, not the problem.

<i>Let the cult flourish, I say. When his socialist, anti-White agenda fails due to his horrendous economic policies (and it will most certainly fail) perhaps all the &ldquo;hopes&rdquo; and &ldquo;dreams&rdquo; that American leftists have invested in him will be exposed for what they are, and help true Americans to fight back the tide of liberalism and multiculturalism. </i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just wishful thinking. FDR nurtured a depression that lasted his ENTIRE prewar presidency and is still thought of as one of Americas best. Sometimes irrefutable facts just haven&rsquo;t any standing.</p>

			<p><em>Actress Susan Sarandon on Mr. Obama: &ldquo;He is a community organizer like Jesus was. And now, we&rsquo;re a community and he can organize us.&rdquo; Actor Alan Cumming: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like Gandhi or something&hellip;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Again, who truly cares what some celebrity says? Alan Cumming isn&rsquo;t an American, he was born in Scotland. We&rsquo;re all aware of Britain&rsquo;s actions in India which ultimately fostered the likes of a Ghandi. Therefore, I&rsquo;m not sure what Alan Cumming, a citizen of the UK, is getting at by his statement, &#8220;he&rsquo;s (BHO)like Gandhi or something.&#8221; Does Cumming mean that Americans are oppressed peoples, oppressed by a foreign power, and big daddy Obama will deliver the American people from their miserable existence? I feel it&rsquo;s the &#8220;or something&#8221; in Cumming&rsquo;s dull-witted statement that makes the most sense. It is, afterall, Obama the anti-Ghandi, the multicult priest that is leading the charge for the destruction of the white America born and nurtured from the values of the founding peoples. </p>
<p>And what of Sarandon? Does she really need the multicult priest to organize her life in her community? I&rsquo;d be so terribly offended if someone was sent to organize my life. Don&rsquo;t kid yourselves Sue and Al. Big Daddy Obama is not Ghandi, and he certainly isn&rsquo;t Jesus. He&rsquo;ll never passively resist, nor will he preach goodwill and the concepts of turning the other cheek. He will destroy communities at all costs by insighting riots and other forms of violence.   </p>

			<p>Barack is going to be a victim of circumstances, that is for sure. A victimization complex at the core of his personality may be the reason for his nonchalance in these most perilous of times.<br>
 I think a valid third party effort is needed to break the deadlock of the duopoly which invites domination by oligarchs and suffocates political dissent. I am concerned since by midcentury the consequences for our country of this latest binge of deficit spending will become clear. The debt service is going to be paid to sovereign wealth funds, not to &#8220;us&#8221; as it is usually decribed. A revolutionary situation will develop because all solutions proposed by the then-establishment will clearly be counterproductive, and make that extremely so. When we pay our taxes in the future, much of the wealth we consign over to the federal government will be shipped to overseas accounts of countries such as China who likely will be in fierce economic competition with us for remaining global markets and resources. So the reason people will pay taxes then is &hellip;to hasten our demise? I don&rsquo;t think so; and to prepare for that eventuality a powerful third party must be started now so there will be a legitimate channel for the ultimate dissent: secession. Our backs will absolutely be against the wall by then.</p>

<p>The bad economy of the Depression Era didn&rsquo;t hurt FDR&rsquo;s electoral prospects because the state of the economy at the time of his initial election in 1932 and re-elections in 1936 and 1940 just so happened to be worse than in 1928 such that voters wanted to &#8220;throw out the Republicans,&#8221; and better in 1936 than 1932 and then better in 1940 and 1936 such that people re-elected him.  Of course 1944 was an intrabellum election, so the economy (which, for the average domestic worker, was obviously better) didn&rsquo;t play in as much.  After his re-election in 1936, the economy took another nosedive through the 37-38 period, had that second nosedive happened a little earlier or later, FDR would have lost his bid for re-elect in 1936 or 1940, respectively.</p>
<p>Also, part of FDR&rsquo;s 1940 victory was that the Republican nominee, Wendel Wilkie, was pro-draft and pro-war (i.e. WWII), when most of the American public was still against it.</p>
<p>FDR was more a beneficiary of circumstance than anything.</p>

<p>This perky young female &#8220;newscaster&#8221; was interviewing an economist and he said something about the deficit and the debt. She looked at him in surprise and said, &#8220;You mean there&rsquo;s difference between the deficit and the debt?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Not necessarily. During the Great Depression, FDR was elected time after time. It didn&rsquo;t hurt his re-election at all&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim:</p>
<p>At the time, FDR admired socialism and thought it would be good for the US.  Frauds such as Duranty were reporting from Moscow about &#8216;Uncle Joe&rsquo; Stalin and the wonders of a state-controlled economy (while covering up such things as show trials and the state-created famine in the Ukraine). Author Jack Cahsill believes the soviets threatened to expose Duranty&rsquo;s homosexuality.</p>
<p>Now, the evils and terrible outcome of socialism/communism are well known, especially after the implosion of the USSR due to its failed economic system.  Is this system held up for ridicule, mocking and the derision it deserves?  Are the atrocities of the USSR studied in high school history classes or outlined in high school textbooks?  No and NO.  What I see in the high schools is a worship of Che Guevara, Mao and Cuba.</p>
<p>It shows the power of the media and government-controlled schools that these same soviet socialist tactics and ideas that have never worked anywhere, ever and were the cause of so much destruction, death and misery are being re-packaged as &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; and forced down the throats of the American people.</p>
<p>In the 30s people were swayed by FDR to follow the accept the promises of a government-controlled state. His policies extended the Great Depression, extended the misery. After the massive failures in the 20th century of these failed state/authoritarian economies, why would anyone vote for these ideas to be implemented here  &mdash;   in the freest, most prosperous nation ever.</p>
<p>As Lee Bollinger writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Millions of gullible Americans (70%) of voters) think this new &#8216;Team Obama&rsquo; is going to &#8216;fix&rsquo; the economy and that leftists such as Barney Frank and Henry Waxman are actually &#8216;coming to the rescue&rsquo; by holding hearings to blame &#8216;deregulation&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a now full-frontal assault on our freedom, assets and even our lives.</p>

<p>This whole idea of the presidency as some kind of god-like figure is so far from what the founding fathers intended that office to be&hellip;</p>
<p>WHY do we care what &#8220;celebrities&#8221; think? They make movies. Why does that make them an authority on anything OTHER then making movies? Look at how &#8220;celebrities&#8221; get paid millions of dollars to whore themselves shilling products. I guess I&rsquo;m not cool because I don&rsquo;t drink Pepsi like Britney Spears does in commercials??? I&rsquo;ve never understood this at all&hellip;</p>
<p>This whole Obama-nonsense shows just how easy it really is to shape pulic opinion and sway the masses. People are so gullibe. I suggest anyone interested on more of this matter see the excellent book THE MADNESS OF CROWDS&hellip;</p>
<p>This reminds me a lot of &#8220;Trudeaumania&#8221; way back in Canada. Obama may prove just as disastrous for America as Trudeau was for Canada&hellip;.</p>

<p>I used to fear the Fairness Doctrine.  However, as it turns out, us real right-wingers on race had more airtime when the FD was in place.  Once the FD was eliminated, then radio and TV stations no longer had to accept Citizens&rsquo; Councils/Council of Conservative Citizens request to respond to a racial lib.</p>
<p>It just so happens that neocon/lamestream conservative talk radio blossomed when the FD was repudiated, and most of those hosts think there is a correlation.  I don&rsquo;t happen to think so anymore.  I do think that the re-imposition of the FD would mean that some low-rated back-bench neo/lamers (Michael Medved, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly on radio, Mark Levin, Sean Hannity) would have to go to make room for some libs, but it would mean that we&rsquo;d get on radio and TV more often with real racial conservatism.  I don&rsquo;t want to carry water for the neo/lamers who aren&rsquo;t with us on the most important issue anyway.</p>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t going to impose the Fairness Doctrine.  The neocons and liberals are all in the same camp using different approaches to get us to the same result.  Imposing the Fairness Doctrine would take away their control of the opposition.  These talk radio show hosts are no true friends of real conservatives.  They are constantly cheerleading the war on &#8220;terror&#8221; and they never ever talk about important issues of race.  You know someone by the example they lead.  The self proclaimed leader of the conservative movement is a curiously unmarried (divorced three times no children) nonreligious neoconservative talk show host who spends his airtime stroking his own ego but never commenting on important social issues.  Draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p>Like anything else in life it certainly has its flaws, but I have to say that lately I&rsquo;ve been pretty impressed and inspired by the number of astute observations people have been making. </p>
<p>My only wish now is that we could multiply our number by a thousand and begin to organize. I also have to say, and I know that this is a point with which many here would quarrel, that the emphasis should be more on Western ideals, as opposed to just White Nationalism, which I consider to be an over-simplification and narrowing of those ideals. In any event, toward this end I find the recent meeting in Baltimore https://preservingwesternciv.com/index.html to be very encouraging. </p>
