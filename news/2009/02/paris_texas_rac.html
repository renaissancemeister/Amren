<h1>Paris, Texas, Race Relations Dialogue Turns Into Dispute</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Witt, Chicago Tribune, February 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten days into a new American era, a hundred white and black citizens of this deeply polarized east Texas town tried their hand at the kind of racial reconciliation heralded by the historic inauguration of President Barack Obama, gathering for a frank community dialogue on the long-taboo topic of race.</p>
<p>Things didn&rsquo;t go so well.</p>
<p>The black speakers at Thursday night&rsquo;s meeting, led by two conciliation specialists from the U.S. Department of Justice, mostly spoke about incidents of discrimination, prejudice and unfairness they said they routinely suffer in Paris. Their white listeners mostly glared back with their arms crossed.</p>
<p>The four-hour session ended with some participants screaming at each other over the presence of three police cars parked outside the meeting hall, and who had ordered them and why.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m here to talk about racism. I don&rsquo;t see any sense in playing games, pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist,&#8221; said Brenda Cherry, the African-American leader of a local civil rights group. &#8220;When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that&rsquo;s not racism, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason Rogers, the youth pastor of a local black church, reminded the audience of the monument honoring fallen Confederate soldiers that sits on the front lawn of the county courthouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I take my 5-year-old son up to the courthouse, and he says, &#8216;Daddy, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; the history I&rsquo;m going to tell him is that those people fought to keep me a slave,&#8221; Rogers said, as black members of the audience nodded in agreement. &#8220;It bothers my family that there&rsquo;s a large Confederate soldier outside the courthouse. I don&rsquo;t see the difference between a Confederate soldier and a Nazi soldier.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The event was held in a hall at the Paris Fairgrounds, the precise spot where, a century ago, thousands of white citizens gathered to cheer the ritualized lynchings of blacks, chaining them to a flagpole or lashing them to a scaffold before tearing them to pieces and setting them on fire.</p>
<p>But memories of much more recent black victims also filled the room as Paris resident Jacqueline McClelland approached the microphone.</p>
<p>McClelland&rsquo;s 24-year-old son, Brandon, was killed last year, allegedly at the hands of two white men, who authorities charge dragged him beneath a pickup truck until his body was nearly dismembered. The accused killers are awaiting trial on murder charges, although McClelland&rsquo;s family and civil rights leaders want hate crime charges added as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then Creola Cotton stood up to speak.</p>
<p>In 2006, Cotton&rsquo;s daughter Shaquanda, then 14, was sentenced by a local judge to up to 7 years in a youth prison for shoving a hall monitor at Paris High School. Three months earlier, the same judge had sentenced a 14-year-old white girl to probation for the more serious crime of arson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial discrimination in Paris, he [Lamar County Judge Chuck Superville] insisted, is a problem of perception, not reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the black community in this town is suffering a great deal from poverty, broken homes, drugs,&#8221; Superville said. &#8220;Because a larger percentage of the black population is caught up in that, in their anguish they are perceiving they are the victims of discrimination. But white people are not the enemy. Poverty, illiteracy, drugs, absentee fathers  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s the enemy. That&rsquo;s not racism. That&rsquo;s the breakdown of a community.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Only eleven of the fifty states were Confederate. This is a country where people have the freedom to relocate to a state that does not have ANY Confederate memorials or statues. It is not even difficult anymore to avoid looking at a Confederate flag. (Even in formerly Confederate states, they are pretty rare actually.) Let them that hate the South, leave the South. We do not need you. We won&rsquo;t miss you. And there is nobody holding you back. Good riddance.<br>

			<p>I know the word &#8220;dialogue&#8221; has &#8220;di-&#8221; in it, implying two.  Therefore, to be &#8220;di&#8221;alogue, there must be two different people or groups speaking to each other.  Which does not seem to be what happened here.  It was more like a monologue.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention &mdash; it&rsquo;s racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that&rsquo;s not racism, what is it?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>What is it?  (1) Because the black kids are the one doing things detention-worthy.  Don&rsquo;t forget, public school administrators are as liberal in Paris, Texas as they are anywhere, so they&rsquo;ll go to the ends of the Earth to eschew racism.  (2)  Black criminal suspects are less likely to show up for trial and usually have far less to lose in terms of established wealth and social status in Paris, Texas than whites.  Also, the more serious a crime you&rsquo;re accused of committing, the higher your bond will be, and blacks tend toward the more serious end of crimes.  That&rsquo;s why they have higher bonds.   (3)  For the same crime, you&rsquo;ll get a longer sentence if your previous rap sheet is longer.  My theory for this is that the blacks tend to have longer rap sheets than whites.</p>

			<p> Same old black paranoia, different day, different town. Same old biased reporting on the part of the Chicago Tribune, which went all the way to a small city in Texas to point fingers when the metropolis where it publishes is rotten with corruption and racial antagonism.</p>
<p> If blacks and Whites were &#8220;screaming at each other&#8221; at the session, why isn&rsquo;t any of that reported in detail? Why is every person quoted save one, black? Why are black grievances the only ones we are told about? I really can&rsquo;t believe that every White person sat there and &#8220;glared&#8221; (his word) all evening without ever voicing any complaints about black behavior.</p>
<p> And as to the black preacher who says Confederates fought &#8220;to keep me a slave,&#8221; hey, Rev, you ain&rsquo;t never been no slave, and you know it. You just can&rsquo;t stand to see a memorial to White men who fought to preserve their racial heritage.</p>

			<p>If I understand things in the USA correctly, and I&rsquo;m only going by my own experience&hellip; &#8216;blacks&rsquo;, lie, cheat, swindle and even deal out physical abuse; and are rewarded for it.

			<p>You can fool the people under 30 years old. And continue to do that each generation, but it&rsquo;s harder to fool us older folks. It&rsquo;s harder to fool us into thinking that bad race relations consists of whites committing crimes and discriminating, against blacks, like these activists (and the &#8216;justice&rsquo; department representatives here) would like us to believe. </p>

			<p>Very emotional people with limited reasoning ability are difficult to talk to, on any subject.  What&rsquo;s appalling is how many white folks still need to learn this.  </p>
<p>Oh well, let them learn.  Let&rsquo;s have enough screaming incoherent rants that everyone&rsquo;s eyes will eventually be opened. <br>

			<p>Evolutionarily different groups want different things.</p>
<p>Diversity doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>There are no successful historical examples of diversity.</p>
<p>Even among white populations who are sufficiently different, it fails   &mdash;   every time.</p>
<p>We should learn from history instead of repeating it, and teaching ourselves to hate each other in the process.</p>

			<p>When the heck are white folks gonna speak up and defend themselves and finally tell black folks the truth?  The truth they see, the truth they experience, and the truth that black folks themselves are to blame for a lot of their own misery.</p>
<p>I grew up in NYC and white folks were always the victims of blacks.  Whether it was white children vs. black &#8220;menacing&#8221; children in public schools, white employees vs. black &#8220;entitled&#8221; employees, or the white public in general vs. the black &#8220;lawless&#8221; public in general.  And, this was the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s but us white kids knew - way back then - what was coming.  Mostly because it had already arrived!<br>

<p>Well I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. Blacks aren&rsquo;t rewarded for lying and cheating etc. but they are excused up far more than whites. Also, there are certainly some whites who don&rsquo;t try and do the right thing.</p>

It was Howard Witt of the Chicago Tribune who wrote the first story on Jena.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the wikipedia entry:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The first piece from outside the area on the case ran on May 9, 2007, in Left Turn, a small alternative news magazine. The first mainstream US media outlet to cover the matter was the Chicago Tribune, whose Southwest Bureau Chief, Howard Witt, wrote a piece covering the story on May 20. Witt had received a summary of the situation from Alan Bean, a Texas minister who had founded the advocacy group Friends of Justice.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Howard Witt is the mainstream go-to who is all to willing to blow an incident all out of proportions or in the case of Jena, turn the criminals into the victims. He&rsquo;s not looking for understanding and racial reconciliation. He wants to see bear-baiting and he knows how to flame the fires of black hate by reporting a story with an alleged &#8216;racist&rsquo; subplot.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video autobiography:</p>

			<p>When my Grandfather&rsquo;s Grandfather, fighting under General Longstreet, lied wounded on the field of Gettysburg I am fairly certain that Black people were the last thing on that Irish immigrants mind. He was fighting for his family and his adopted State, which he saw as under invasion by Federal forces.</p>
<p>It is a deep and shameful thing that we as a society have allowed liberals, Blacks, and special interests to co-op the American Civil War in general, and the Confederacy in particular, into something somehow racist. I echo the wise comments of an earlier poster: All who hate the South, and its history, are free to move north of the Mason-Dixon. You will not be missed. </p>

			<p>To those who don&rsquo;t know, this is the Jena 6 reporter.  Remember him?</p>
<p>He distorted the entire situation so badly it didn&rsquo;t even resemble the truth.  I&rsquo;ve never seen so many lies in one report in my entire life.  So disgusting.  </p>
<p>This is an example of what journalism has fallen to in this country.  He didn&rsquo;t even bother to quote any  complaints from whites who attended, but he gives plenty of play to blacks.</p>
<p>This man is part of the evil that has overtaken America.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If that&rsquo;s not racism, what is it?,&#8221; asks Brenda Cherry. The answer of course is that &#8220;racism&#8221; means no more and no less than whatever is required to advance non-white causes. </p>

			<p>All higher cultures of the West, from the Greeks, to the Christians, to the Nation-State, and, the great Corporation (great for its size and technical mastery of its resources) all grew as a result of cultivating people capable of engaging in prolonged problem-exposure.  The ability to endure the tension that comes from thinking carefully about a highly complicated and concentrated subject, or series of subjects, was, and is, the mark of men that we refer to as, Wise.</p>
<p>The West is the only culture group that self-consciously enshrined this bit of behavior into its culture, and that is why it has been so extraordinarily dynamic. Until now.</p>
<p>The intellectually-challenged, the psychologically weak, and emotionally explosive person, can not, in any way, tolerate the tension that comes from thinking carefully, about anything. These are the child-people of the world, and their tide is rising.</p>
<p>These are the kind of people who need to have a final answer for everything, preferably ONE answer, for everything, and need to have it right away. The equivalent in terms of nutrition would be MacDonalds.  There is plenty of evidence for this in the above article.  &#8220;If there is a problem, it&rsquo;s because of racism. If this or that happened, it&rsquo;s because of racism.&#8221;  As Marion Barry is said to have remarked, &#8220;Hell, Gravity is racist.&#8221;<br>
Certainly, a better example of an adult-child desperate for an easy answer would be impossible to imagine. </p>
<p>But difficulties arise, and the problem worsens, when such people are placed above criticism, or, in positions of great authority.</p>
<p>On November 4th, 2008, the United States &#8220;elected&#8221; Barak Obama. </p>

			<p>I googled &#8220;paris fairgrounds&#8221; and &#8220;lynchings,&#8221; and got a lot of hits, some claiming that &#8220;dozens of lynchings&#8221; were carried out there between the Civil War and WWII.</p>
<p>I did only a cursory search and didn&rsquo;t come across anything I felt was really reliable  &mdash;  I&rsquo;d like to know the true history of lynchings at the Paris fairgrounds, but am hoping someone can give me some leads so I don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch to research it.</p>

			<p>The guys who dragged the black man under the truck should be charged with murder and receive the death penalty just as did the guys in Jasper Tx.  <br>
Having said that, I&rsquo;d like to know why the Karr brother&rsquo;s sentences were commuted from death to life. I&rsquo;d wager that those animals will be paroled in a few more years after the majority of the people have forgotten the five victims and the horror that they suffered. <br>
Has anyone followed up on the Christian/Newsome murders in Knoxville? And what about Lauren Burk and Eve Carson and the thousands of White and Asian Americans who die or are otherwise brutalized at the hands of Afro-American criminals? Anyone who is keeping score knows that Blacks have been running UP the score for decades now. If a white woman clutches her purse more tightly while passing a Black on the street or a person in a car rolls up his/her windows when stopped at traffic light in a Black neighborhood, that&rsquo;s realism not racism. Experience teaches us that we have reason to anticipate gratuitous violence from Blacks.<br>
Just today, I was talking to a colleague about this very situation and was quite surprised to learn that he knew nothing about the Wichita and Knoxville murders nor about the Burk and Carson killings. He was also surprised when I mentioned the coed at Columbia who was so brutally raped and tortured for hours in her off campus apartment two years ago.  So many Whites go about their  business every day totally oblivious to what&rsquo;s going on out there whereas Blacks are constantly vigilant about any slight or even a glance that could be interpreted as racism.<br>

			<p>Theres nothing to accomplishb by trying to have a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; of this sort.  What on earth do you expect to resolve?  These people want money and much much more affirmative action and heavy duty quotas and heavy criminal penalties for offending them.  These are the things they want.  what is a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; going to accomplish.  Even if these people had all the things they wanted they would still hate us.</p>

			<p>Oh dear, I thought the election of a black president was supposed to make all this nasty racial tension go away. Of course no one with any intelligence believed that and now we see yet another liberal falsehood blown to bits.</p>
<p>Quote: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to talk about racism. I don&rsquo;t see any sense in playing games, pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; said Brenda Cherry, the African-American leader of a local civil rights group. &ldquo;When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention &mdash; it&rsquo;s racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that&rsquo;s not racism, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nonsense. Black kids are in detention more often because they misbehave more often. Outside of school the bonds and sentences are higher because their crimes are more serious and they pose a greater risk to society. Black culture has always had a strong criminal element and they have no one but themselves to blame. Facts and statistics don&rsquo;t lie. Shut up and sing.</p>
<p>Quote: &ldquo;When I take my 5-year-old son up to the courthouse, and he says, &lsquo;Daddy, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; the history I&rsquo;m going to tell him is that those people fought to keep me a slave,&rdquo; Rogers said, as black members of the audience nodded in agreement. &ldquo;It bothers my family that there&rsquo;s a large Confederate soldier outside the courthouse. I don&rsquo;t see the difference between a Confederate soldier and a Nazi soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought: instead of whining about injustices you never experienced why not focus on the here and now? You live as a pampered ethnic group in the most prosperous country in the world. Would you rather live in Africa? Maybe you should be a little more thankful for slavery. You owe to slavery that you&rsquo;re where you are. Shut up and sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But memories of much more recent black victims also filled the room as Paris resident Jacqueline McClelland approached the microphone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its high time more whites started complaining about black on white crime. We have plenty to complain about. <a href="https://www.nationalpolicyinstitute.org/2009/01/20/president-elect-obama-support-proposed-housesenate-res-condemming-black-on-white-crime-in-america/" rel="nofollow">https://www.nationalpolicyinstitute.org/2009/01/20/president-elect-obama-support-proposed-housesenate-res-condemming-black-on-white-crime-in-america/</a></p>
<p>Quote: &ldquo;I think the black community in this town is suffering a great deal from poverty, broken homes, drugs,&rdquo; Superville said. &ldquo;Because a larger percentage of the black population is caught up in that, in their anguish they are perceiving they are the victims of discrimination. But white people are not the enemy. Poverty, illiteracy, drugs, absentee fathers &mdash; that&rsquo;s the enemy. That&rsquo;s not racism. That&rsquo;s the breakdown of a community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was probably the greatest amount of sense spoken at this little get-together but I don&rsquo;t know why the white man even bothered. You can&rsquo;t reason with a spoiled child and you can&rsquo;t reason with a black.</p>
<p>Whites need to focus on saving themselves. Screw the rest.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but this sounds impossible to me.  Is shoved supposed to translate as &#8220;beat half-to-death&#8221; or something along those lines?  Kids don&rsquo;t get 7 years in jail for shoving eachother.</p>

			<p>As the AR subtitle of this article suggests, &#8220;Dialogue&#8221; is yet another euphamism bandied about by any given &#8220;victim&#8221; group to assail Whites for their wickedness, while Whites sit, stonefaced, and tak etheir medicine. If one dares pipe-up or defend oneself, that dissent or denial is, of course, still more &#8220;racism&#8221; and White wickedness. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to see how effective this &#8220;Dialogue&#8221; on race that some love to crow about, really is. In the modern age it boils down to this:</p>
<p>Multiracialism = conflict, resentment, volatility</p>
<p>Homogeneity = harmony, unity, relative peace</p>

			<p>&ldquo;When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention &mdash; it&rsquo;s racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Love it&hellip; these people will just never learn, will they?  Having done my time in the &#8220;Blackboard Jungle&#8221; myself before going on to a successful, productive, and rewarding Teaching career in predominantly White schools, Ms. Cherry&rsquo;s not lying about the first part of her statement, but once again, goes off and blames Whites for her own people&rsquo;s collective inability to behave in a civil, decent manner.  Nope, Ms. Cherry, it&rsquo;s not Racism, it&rsquo;s a seeming overwhelming race-wide inability to sit still and pay attention and do classwork without constantly and continually being disruptive, hurling obscenities across the classroom, not bringing pencils, paper, losing textbooks, etc. etc. &#8220;I ain&rsquo;t got no book, man!&#8221; &#8220;N*&^% be trippin&rsquo;, ya&rsquo;ll!&#8221; etc. etc. so on and so forth.  This is the reason why it is admittedly overwhelmingly the Blacks you see sittting in the detention halls.</p>
<p>You make a legitimate effort to educate these people, put all of your heart and soul into trying to do a good job for ALL of your students and try to silence your own misgivings of the absolute ultimate futility of the job you are trying to do with those people whom you are ostensibly there to educate, and for what?  Yep, you guessed it&hellip; to get the now long-worn-out epithet of &#8220;Racism&#8221; hurled at you.  You call parents to inform them of Tyrone or Shaquitta&rsquo;s behavior (or lack thereof) in class, or the fact that they are failing, or haven&rsquo;t been in class in two weeks, and the parents accuse you of &hellip; yep, you guessed it&hellip; &#8220;Racism,&#8221; because you took the time out of your already swamped schedule with 130+ kids under your tutelage that you are trying to keep on task and passing to try to get some kind of &#8220;dialogue&#8221; going about their kid&rsquo;s education so that the kid wouldn&rsquo;t fail.  And that&rsquo;s &#8220;Racism&#8221; to these people.  You try to make the kid behave in a &#8220;civil&#8221; manner (after all &#8220;civil&#8221; is the key word in &#8220;civilization&#8221;) among other people and they call that &#8220;Racism.&#8221;  </p>
<p>So, you do your year in &#8220;the Jungle,&#8221; and what do you do?  You move on to greener teaching pastures (i.e. predominantly WHITE schools or districts), which, lo and behold, amazingly have NONE of the problems that the &#8220;Inner City&#8221; (i.e. Black) districts have.  Wow!  The kids in these latter districts actually want to learn!  The kids actually bring their books, paper, writing utensils, do their homework, come to class (ON TIME!!! wow, how mysterious!), don&rsquo;t scream across the classroom, speak in grammatically-correct STANDARD English, know how to say &#8220;Sir&#8221; and &#8220;Ma&rsquo;am,&#8221; (and use them!!!), don&rsquo;t use obscenities in the classroom as if it&rsquo;s a natural and acceptable (indeed, COMMON!) thing to do, don&rsquo;t dress and act (indeed, overwhelmingly aspire to be) &#8220;gangsta,&#8221;  and actually seem to be on their collective way to a productive adulthood as civilized members of society.  How strange and mysterious!  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just my own personal experience.  You ask ANY Teacher (off the record, of course) who has &#8220;done their time&#8221; down there in &#8220;The Jungle&#8221; what the problem is and they will tell you &hellip;. it&rsquo;s simply a collective failure of an virtually an entire Race to assimilate to any kind of civilized decent, human values and nothing more.  Check out this most absolutely relevant and pertinent article on the topic from last year, &#8220;Why Shakir Can&rsquo;t Read.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/06/why_shakir_cant_read.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/06/why_shakir_cant_read.html</a></p>
<p>As one commenter on the article noted, &#8220;You multiply Shakir by 40, and you have the modern Inner City Classroom.&#8221; </p>
<p>I honestly believe that, by and large, they are utterly beyond hope, and it wasn&rsquo;t until years afterwards that I came across the Schweitzer quote on dealing with Africans that shocked me with it&rsquo;s essential, utter veracity.  I&rsquo;m telling you friends, having dealt with these people on a first-hand basis, you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet.  </p>
<p>Criticism is easy.  Solutions are more difficult.  My solution?  Absolute SEPARATION&hellip; Black Schools, Black Students, Black Teachers&hellip; we need to wash our hands clean of any more Responsibility for these people&rsquo;s collective failure across the board.  Writ large&hellip; yep, this is one School Teacher absolutely 100% supportive of Separate Homelands for the Separate Races&hellip; based on my own personal experience dealing with these people on a firsthand basis.  After all, honestly, candidly, what is really &#8220;United&#8221; about the U.S. anymore?  Time to end the charade for both ourselves and our children&rsquo;s future.  It is time for action on a National Scale.  The time for &#8220;Dialogue&#8221; is long, long past.</p>

			<p>There were 27 northern states and 11 southern states and the north outnumbered the south 5-1 at 5 million whites to 25 million whites and also had 10-1 financial resources. </p>
<p>GOP Lincoln preemptively attacked the south and 4 yrs later 1 of every 5 or 20% of southern whites were killed and over 50% wounded with everything reduced to rubbled with looting rampant and arson consumed every city town or village. </p>
<p>The scorched earth policy was used to wipe out the south and over 100,000 civilians were murdered in the process. These figures are probably worse but the revisionists took control and wrote what they wanted.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&lsquo;Daddy, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; the history I&rsquo;m going to tell him is that those people fought to keep me a slave,</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss, as the saying goes. The Civil War was neither for prolonging or ending slavery, but over the issue of states rights and self determination. Lincoln desperately WANTED an excuse to go to war against the seceded states, finally managing to goad the Southern forces into firing on Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>The call to ending slavery came much, much later in the war. Becoming a rallying cry for the North, given the horrific number of casualties&hellip; deaths and serious injuries suffered by so many Northern soldiers resulted in many people actively AVOIDING the draft, by paying substitutes to serve in their stead, by fleeing from their locations.</p>
<p>But you can never expect Blacks to either understand or admit that reality. After all, myths and melodrama are far pleasanter to them than reality, right? Much like that overhyped Black History nonsense. When a racial group has no real history to point to&hellip; no real accomplishments comparable to what other races, other cultures achieved on their own efforts&hellip; history has to be &#8216;created&rsquo;. Made up out of whole cloth, as the saying goes. And like a lie repeated often enough, becomes accepted the the &#8216;truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It might also be pointed out the institution of slavery was dying a natural death even at the time of the Civil War. It simply was not cost-effective. Aside from the fact Blacks were poor workers who constantly required supervision to ensure they&rsquo;d perform as ordered.</p>
<p>Another cherished Black myth&hellip; those Hollywood-created sterotypes of indescribable cruel punishments meeted out to unruly slaves. Trained slaves, of course, were considered valuable property. On a par with prize oxen and cattle, with fine quality horses. So given their cash value, WHY would any rational slave-ower brutalize his chattel to the point they could not function? Would a sane farmer torture and kill a prize stallion, a fine breed mare, fine cattle? Of course, the answer is &#8216;NO.&rsquo; But like I pointed out, myth and melodrama is far pleasanter to Blacks than the admission most slave owners treated their slaves decently and humanely. REWARDING good performance and behavior with gifts of better clothing, better food, even with money. As well as the reality many caring slave owners also had their slaves set free in their wills. Hollywood, unfortunataly realized those truths simply don&rsquo;t sell as well as the images of slaves being whipped and tortured to a bloody death. Thus Hollywood sensationalism and propaganda are responsible for what Blacks &#8220;know&#8221; of the pre-Civil War South.</p>

<p>White folks are too busy using racial piety for one-upmanship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changing, however, now that we have a president who shows us our third-world future.</p>
<p>I believe conservatives are racial realists, and know diversity doesn&rsquo;t work. Liberals, on the other hand, are racist: they know diversity doesn&rsquo;t work but want to use the poor impoverished minorities as a symbol of white liberal selflessness.</p>
<p>Insane logic, but that&rsquo;s what it seems to be.</p>

 I grew up in a rural poor county and we were all irt poor but the white houses and property were kept up as best we could and you knew when you crossed the line into the mexican and black areas. General uncleanliness leads to lower expectations and that leads to drugs and criminal behavoir. Blacks may get harsher sentences than whites but is that because whites do lesser crimes or racial preference? Why not check the criminal records and see?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The black speakers at Thursday night&rsquo;s meeting, led by two conciliation specialists from the U.S. Department of Justice, mostly spoke about incidents of discrimination, prejudice and unfairness they said they routinely suffer in Paris. Their white listeners mostly glared back with their arms crossed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kind of like a re-education session in the old Soviet Union. Sounds to me like those White listeners have had their fill of these idiots. Calling the cops was a smart move.</p>

			<p>Why are blacks screaming about &#8216;injustice&rsquo;? Whites who commit crimes are move likely be caught and get arrested. People of color are more likely to get away with it an never be caught. Of course, if they keep committing crimes, the odds will catch up with them and even this &#8216;advantage&rsquo; wont save them. </p>

<p>I agree Brett.  But there is also a segment of our race that is ignorance and self-absorbed who are so interested in watching black men run around in lycra or nylon (as a fellow Amrener so eloquently put it) or salivating at the spectacle that is celebrity that they ignore the indoctrination their kids receive at school, their willing acceptance of being tarred and feathered by minorities and the white Marxist enemies, and the dire situation our country is in.  Also, I regret to say there is a large portion of us that are just plain old stupid.  This is our home and we simply don&rsquo;t care.  The nation is a hotbed of chaos and seething anger.  And white folks hide their heads in the sand.  The best portion of our people were destroyed fighting for America during the last 10+ wars.  Whether it was the Spanish-American War, the Civil War, Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand, or Korea, we just don&rsquo;t make em like we used to.<br>

<p>Well spoken, FRIEND! Philadelphia, PA., being an excellent case in point. West Philadelphia prior to WWII was pleasant, genteel area with many fine old mansions. After WWII, Blacks moved into Philly in droves. Predictably, those stately old mansions in West Philly being promptly TRASHED by its Black inhabitants. North Philadelphia, Central Philadelphia often resembling bombed out ruins when seen from the Market-Frankford El. There had been much printers ink wasted on &#8220;racist&#8221; Whites in the Northeast, Kensington, Mayfair and other areas. Those &#8220;evil&#8221; Whites trying to keep Blacks out of their areas. Small wonder, given the destruction and crime that accompanies Blacks wherever they aggregate. I left in Philly in the 1980s. I just got tired of the way the city was deteriorating, thanks to its Black inhabitants. Public transportation covered with graffiti, seats ripped and torn. Blacks smoking pot on buses and trains   &mdash;   &#8220;to hell with the regulations&#8221;, right?</p>

I&rsquo;m tired of blacks asking questions but not seeking the answer.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s true that a white girl committed one kind of crime and appears to have been given a break while a black girl committed a different crime and was given a harsher sentence, then these people must go to the people responsible for imposing these different sentences. What good does posing these questions in a shouting forum do?</p>
<p>All we ever get are the accusations by blacks and the speculation by journalists but NO ONE, including justice department officials, ever seem to question the people who made the decisions. Who made the decision? Why was it made? What factors were taken into account? Are both crimes being described accurately or is one being played up and the other down? Why doesn&rsquo;t a journalist or the JD interview the judges to find out what&rsquo;s going on if anything?</p>

			<p>  A little historical clarification here. Lincoln never goaded the South into the Civil War since the attack on Sumter was just one of many attacks on Federal property. The stage for the Civil War the culmination of years of border disputes and compromises-from the Missouri Compromise to the Compromise of 1850. Now just throw in the Dred Scott Decision and John Brown&rsquo;s raid, stir in years of Southern trade and economis grievances, mix with a variety of Southern political slavers and there you have it.<br>
   This war was not about ending slavery as much as it was a war to stop the spread and the social/economic/political repercussions of a slave economy.</p>

<p>This sad but true. I grew up in black neighborhood and alot them couldn&rsquo;t figure out why their neighborhood looked this way. they littered, graffitied, trashed and direspected their own neighborhood. This is not a representation of the majority of them.</p>

<p>Not at all. It could just as easily mean that black kids make more trouble and are more unruly. Someone should do a school-discipline problem study equivalent to THE COLOR OF CRIME. It would probably show much the same results. My sister was a teacher for several years and blacks gave her far more trouble then all other groups combined. My sister is also pretty liberal too. She often said Asians were the best students. Talk to just about any teacher off the record who&rsquo;s been around and they will all tell you the same thing, blacks are their worst nightmare. My sister finally quit teaching because of them. Unfortunately she is still a liberal.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The event was held in a hall at the Paris Fairgrounds, the precise spot where, a century ago, thousands of white citizens gathered to cheer the ritualized lynchings of blacks, chaining them to a flagpole or lashing them to a scaffold before tearing them to pieces and setting them on fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Documentation please.  I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this statement or any other black victimization falsehoods.  According to FBI statistics, more Whites are murdered by blacks every year that blacks were lynched by Whites during the whole of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the blacks who were lynched were either proven murderers or rapists. It wasn&rsquo;t just blacks, either.  Look what happened to the rapist and murderer of Mary Phagan, a white man.</p>

			<p>Nothing changes.  I had to sit through this  40 years ago when the first affirmative action morons were hired by my employer because of Judicial dictators and the EEOC gestapo.</p>
<p>What I really resented was the black men&rsquo;s arrogant assumption that we young white women were there for their sexual use.  Turning these lechers down earned accusations of racism and we white women were sent to re education sessions run by white feminazis.</p>
<p>Sometimes I thought my head would explode during these sessions.  I have never felt such rage.  We were compelled to attend these sessions for years.</p>
<p>I think the best thing a white person can do when compelled to go to one of these Maoist style sessions is just hold your left arm out at a weird angle, twitch it, grunt, moan and fall on the floor.</p>
<p>That should end the session or at least you will get out of it.</p>

Yes.  They ask a question as a way of TELLING you something.  In other words, it&rsquo;s only a rhetorical question.  They&rsquo;re not really interested in your answer.   </p>
<p>After all, why would they want your answer when they&rsquo;re convinced they already know all the answers?   I have long noticed that the more ignorant a person is, the more convinced he will be that he knows it all.   Only the intelligent person is aware of what he DOESN&rsquo;T know.</p>

<p>Be also interesting to see documentation on how many Whites have been murdered in political attacks in South Africa/Zimbabwe since black majority rule was imposed. If what the folks over at the South Africa Sucks website is the case, the numbers of Whites murdered in the last couple of decades are on the same scale as blacks lynched  &mdash;  but in a much shorter time span.<br>

			<p>Still Teaching hit the nail on the head with their post.  Blacks want to see whats wrong with themselves?  Look in the mirror or at the person sitting next to them in their neighborhood.  Blacks constantly complain about racism and how the white man gets everything etc, etc.  But the taxpayers of this country have invested over a trillion dollars into the Black race. For what?  And they still want more!!  When you hear politicians talk about &#8220;saving schools in the inner city&#8221; or &#8220;creating jobs for out of work people&#8221;  that is just code-speak for &#8220;just give them more money so they can sit on their collective rears and continue doing nothing.&#8221;  Any white person who lasts a year there trying to survive, oops,I mean teach, should get battle pay.  And the Blacks wonder why &#8220;racism&#8221; still exists??</p>

You&rsquo;re so right. I left Philadelphia around the same time. I grew up four blocks from the Connie Mack stadium. I worked in Frankford, rode the Route 60 trolley to K &amp; A and took the El to where I taught.  We used to call it the &#8220;African Queen&#8221;. They<br>
 (the Bantu) would get on the train and run through the cars unscrewing the light bulbs from the overheads and throwing them around the cars. They used to do the ame thing on the Broad street Subway; that is when they weren&rsquo;t otherwise occupied with assaulting White people.<br>

<p>Fine post, Fellow Traveler.</p>
<p>I did my time in an inner city school and it opened my eyes wide to the differences between the races.  I agree with you completely:  There will be no reconciliation, no dialog, we are far past that point. Hurling accusations at Whites of &#8216;racism!&rsquo; for black failure solves nothing.  The only solution&hellip;separation. </p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;You ask ANY Teacher (off the record, of course) who has &#8216;done their time&rsquo; down there in &#8216;The Jungle&rsquo; what the problem is and they will tell you &hellip;. it&rsquo;s simply a collective failure of an virtually an entire Race to assimilate to any kind of civilized decent, human values and nothing more&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>By failure, I assume you mean an utter inability to function within the confines of decent human values due to blacks&rsquo; propensity for aggression and violence, failure to plan for the future, impulsivity and an inability to respect and follow rules (as you pointed out in your post  &mdash;  screaming across the room, throwing things, constant excuse-making and blaming, refusal to sit quietly, open hostility and disrespect toward authority, etc.).</p>
<p>The educational system in the US is a White conceit, designed for White children, White IQs and White learning styles  &mdash;  it is not possible for most black children to conform to the strictures of such a system as is proved over and over again by blacks&rsquo; low test scores and schools marked by chaos, violence and disorder.  </p>
<p>The following article from AmRen will explain and justify everything you experienced in the majority-black school: </p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/08/race_and_psycho.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/08/race_and_psycho.php</a></p>
<p>I read the article you posted &#8220;Why Shakir Can&rsquo;t Read&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there are many causal factors for Shakir&rsquo;s non-performance in school; amongst them are Shakir himself and his priorities; the instability of his family; his community culture; and, the school system itself&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article (as most others) omits The Main Reason why Shakir and others of his ilk cannot read:  His IQ of 85 will not allow him to advance past a very rudimentary level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are very very few critics and educational writers who are brave enough to state that fact.  With that indisputable fact in mind, any efforts made to educate Shakir past about a 2nd or 3rd grade level will be in vain  &mdash;  resulting in exasperation from the teacher and rising hostility from &#8216;Shakir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charles Murray writes that academic achievement is best predicted by IQ and that this is why, despite billions of dollars, NCLB has failed to close the achievement gap &mdash; in fact, the gap has stayed the same or even grown larger since 2002.</p>
<p>Until black average IQs of 85 and black pathologies are recognized as the intractable realities they are, no amount of money or the latest &#8216;brain-based&rsquo; teaching methods will accomplish anything except more frustration and angst  &mdash;  and new, more expensive proposals to do the impossible: close the achievement gap.</p>
