<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29095730/">Over 200 Americans Killed in Mexico Since &rsquo;04</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, February 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 200 American citizens have been killed since 2004 in Mexico&rsquo;s escalating wave of violence, amounting to the highest number of unnatural deaths in any foreign country outside military combat zones, according to the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>The deaths included a 22-year-old Houston man and his 16-year-old friend who were hauled out of a minivan and shot execution style. They also included a 65-year-old nurse from Brownsville found floating in the Rio Grande after visiting a Mexican beauty salon and a retiree stabbed to death while camping on a Baja beach, reported the Houston Chronicle in a story published Sunday, which examined hundreds of records related to the deaths.</p>
<p>The State Department tracks most American homicides abroad but releases few details about the deaths. Most, however, occurred in border cities, including Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez and Nuevo Laredo, where violence has spiked with drug cartel feuds in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in at least 70 other cases, the Americans were killed in Mexico while there on seemingly innocent business: visiting family, vacationing or living and working there.</p>
<p>Mexican Congressman Juan Francisco Rivera Bedoya of Nuevo Leon said he believes most American victims get killed after crossing the border for illegal activities or venturing into unsafe areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tourists visiting cathedrals, museums and other cultural centers are not at risk,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Travel alerts&rsquo; for border communities</b></p>
<p>The State Department last year issued &#8220;travel alerts&#8221; for several border communities, warning that dozens of U.S. citizens had been kidnapped or killed in Tijuana, though it gave no details.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico said over the weekend that 100 more federal police officers had been assigned to the capital&rsquo;s airport following a series of assaults on travelers who exchanged money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal Police official Brig. Gen. Alfredo Fregoso said the reinforcement brings to 500 the number of federal officers patrolling the airport.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Gruesome deaths</b></p>
<p>Across Mexico, more than 5,000 people were killed last year, authorities report. Some of the deaths of police and other public officials have been public and gruesome, with bodies posed in public places.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only about 20 percent of homicides in Mexico result in arrests, the Chronicle found in its analysis of data from the Citizens&rsquo; Safety Institute. The Mexico City-based nonprofit surveys prosecutors across Mexico.</p>
<p>Records from the prosecutor in Baja California Norte, home to Tijuana, show none of the cases from 2004 to 2006 have been closed. More than 90 Americans have been killed in the state south of San Diego since 2003.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d like to say I feel bad about those Americans killed in Mexico, but sooner or later, people who are clueless about what Mexico is, are going to pay in some way.</p>

			<p>I saw on the evening news a couple of days ago about how a white, pale American was picked up by the Mexican puercos (pigs)in a conveniance store because his relative was accused of asking two 14 year old Mexican girls to pose nude for them.The allegation was completely false, as you can guess.He is 88 years old, and has been in a Mexican jail for 8 monthes.He has pneumonia, and he might die if he is not treated soon.If he does die, how much can they be sued for?A bunch of Mexican illegals who were beaten by American police as they fleed from the Border Patrol as they were entering the country illegally and  the beating was filmed by American media, and each one of them, about eight, recieved hundreds of thousands apiece.The United States is just a big piggy bank to Mexicans, partly because so many of us help them to rob us blind. </p>

			<p>If I had to guess, I think it would be about evenly split between the truly innocent, mostly white American tourists, and &#8220;Americans&#8221; (really, Mexicans) going back to Mexico for some sort of criminal enterprise.</p>

			<p>I heard thru a friend,who has military friends, that the military  (I&rsquo;m assuming the USMC and Navy) stationed in Southern California have strict orders not to enter Mexico. It is common for those stationed in San Diego to party down there. Don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true. Maybe someone will post what they know.</p>

			<p>Getting killed in Mexico is a far greater possibility than getting killed in a US city with a higher murder rate, because Mexico disallows anyone to defend themselves.</p>
<p>The only ones who can carry weapons are the criminals.  A perfect example of a society who disarms the citizens who are law-abiding.</p>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s much self-protection of the elites involved here.  If the public were armed the narco paid judges, cops, military, politicians, etc., who comprise the vast majority of the government, wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep committing crimes.</p>
<p>Mexico will go down even before the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>Mexico is in the throes of a low-grade civil war, fought between the narcotics trafficers and the few remaining honest parts of the government.  WHY would anyone want to vacation there?  It makes as much sense as spending money going on a trip to Chechnya or the Sudan.</p>

Canadian television is always running stories about Canadians killed in Mexico and how the police are indifferent, corrupt, and inept.</p>
<p>Canada regularly issues warning about traveling to Mexico especially around the period of college spring break.</p>

			<p>I am writing this from Medellin Colombia. Yes, mexico has changed from a poor but relativly safe haven for american tourists to a dangerous place for tourists. Its not reported in the press but so has Costa Rica which has an excellent reputation but in reality is very dangerous once outside the tourist zones. I lived in CR 4 years but had to leave due to the danger along with a lot of my freinds who found out that paradise is not as it was advertised. As the previous poster mentioned you are fairly safe in the museums or other tourist spots but if you are there for more than a week or so you need to venture out to the stores ect in the non tourist part of town. Last year I was walking in Barrio Amon in San Jose CR which is the best part of town and was mugged violently. I actually dont much mind being pickpocketed or non violently robbed as that is part of living there but I narrowly escaped with my life. I did research and found that one of the safest cities in the world is actually Medellin Colombia, 20 years ago the murder and drug capital of the world. But things can change, and the press will never give Bush credit but his Plan Colombia implemented in 2002 has been an overwhelming success here, implemented by the right wing american educated president Uribe. Medellin is a first world beautiful and safe city that gets no press possibly because the left leaning press wont give credit to Bush or a right wing success story. Of course next door neighbor nutcase commie Hugo Chavez is in the news always. Any of you interested in vacationing or retiring in any of the spanish speaking countries should obtain more info about Colombia, the FARC has been pushed far into the jungle almost to extinction and the people like americans. Pablo Escobar was killed a decade ago. I live in an upper class section of Medellin called Poblado and walk safely everywhere and have never even seen so much as a barfight among locals. Of course, one anywhere must use caution and not venture into the slum areas any where in the world. The point I am making here is that nowhere was more dangerous than here a short while ago but with a strong willed right wing government well financed miracles can happen, and weak left wing woosie goverments most always turn thier countries into corrupt and murdererous places.

			<p>&#8220;Almost none of the killers have been caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is true around the world is it not? When Whites are killed by people of color the killer is much more likely to avoid apprehension.<br>

<p>im a navy guy stationed down here in san diego for now.  Each different unit has their own &#8220;mexico policy&#8221;, for the most part everbody is told to stay out. i have no idea about the marine corps rules. I dont know if it made national news yet but about a week ago 2 marines were arrested in Tijuana for supposedly stabbing 2 prostitutes (they lived).  Mexican news showed the marines on TV after the police roughed them up a little bit.</p>

<p>Were these marines white?  This doesn&rsquo;t sound like a &#8220;white&#8221; type of crime.  Stabbing prostitues is not something that most white people do.    </p>
<p>And an awful lot of &#8220;American&#8221; military personnel these days are not white, but they reflect badly on us anyway.</p>

			<p>A good friend of mine told me a few weeks ago about his 23 year old daughter who was vacationing in Mexico.  &#8220;What?,&#8221; I shouted through the telephone.  But he can&rsquo;t reason with her, she has lived in Italy and L.A., and is now headed for Australia on an invitation.  I hope she makes it through this stage of her life okay, but she is typical of the Globetreking naivettes who often blunder into dangerous situations abroad.</p>

			<p>My dad had a black friend who got arrested in MEXICO. When he came to pick him they had to buy him a new pair of pants because there was so much blood in his jeans. He was never the same after that.</p>
<p>As some one who was born in San Diego I&rsquo;ll tell you there are a number of fools who go down there to party and dont come back again. I think the border should be a one way street. In to MEXICO and come back on a plain.</p>
<p>I party in some of the blackest and dangerous neighborhoods in FLORIDA and I would never step foot in MEXICO with out a gun or some of my buddies with me. MEXICO is far worst than any black neighborhood.</p>
