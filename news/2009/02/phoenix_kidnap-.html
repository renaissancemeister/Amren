			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Quinones, Los Angeles Times, February 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In broad daylight one January afternoon, on a street of ranch-style houses with kidney-shaped swimming pools, Juan Francisco Perez-Torres was kidnapped in front of his wife, daughter and three neighbors.</p>
<p>Two men with a gun grabbed the 34-year-old from his van and dragged him 50 yards to a waiting SUV. His wife threw rocks at the car, then gave chase in her own SUV. Neighbors in northwest Phoenix called police. Yet when police found her later, she at first denied there was a problem.</p>
<p>On the phone later, as detectives listened in, kidnappers said Perez-Torres had stolen someone&rsquo;s marijuana.</p>
<p>But police were used to conflicting story lines by now. It was Phoenix, after all: More ransom kidnappings happen here than in any other town in America, according to local and federal law enforcement authorities. Most every victim and suspect is connected to the drug-smuggling world, usually tracing back to the western Mexican state of Sinaloa, Phoenix police report.</p>
<p>Arizona has become the new drug gateway into the United States. Roughly half of all marijuana seized along the U.S.-Mexico border was taken on the state&rsquo;s 370-mile border with Mexico.</p>
<p>One result is an epidemic of kidnapping that many residents are barely aware of. Indeed, most every other crime here is down. But police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports last year, and 359 in 2007. Police estimate twice that number go unreported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ransom kidnapping is a rare crime in America. Most cops go their entire careers without handling one. These days, most kidnappings involve a husband taking a child from an estranged wife. That&rsquo;s how things were in Phoenix until a few years ago.</p>
<p>Then things changed in Sinaloa.</p>
<p>Along the Pacific Coast several hours south of Arizona, Sinaloa is the state where drug smuggling in Mexico began. Most Mexican cartels originated there. Kidnapping was how they collected debts. For many years, they kidnapped other smugglers and left law-abiding citizens alone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A fast-growing city, Phoenix had long been a destination for Mexican immigrants, and for Sinaloans in particular. Today, Phoenix detectives say, only the rare kidnapper is not from Sinaloa. They often come from the same Sinaloan towns: Los Mochis, Leyva, Guasave.</p>
<p>Like construction or restaurant work, kidnapping in Phoenix relies on cheap Mexican laborers. The grunt work, like guarding the victim, is often done by young, unemployed illegal immigrants, desperate for work, who sign on for $50 to $200 a day, Garcia said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kidnapping in Phoenix attracts immigrants whose American dream is to make it big in the underworld. In Mexico, cartels limit their options. But cartel control is weak in Phoenix. Many resort to kidnapping because &#8220;for once, they&rsquo;re the guys with the gun, the ones with the power,&#8221; Salgado said. &#8220;They are in control. In Mexico they&rsquo;re not in control.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Phoenix police say they have never lost a victim during a rescue attempt. But detectives wondered how long their record would hold, and how long they could stave off the violence that has left more than 8,000 people dead in Mexico in the last two years.</p>

			<p>Kidnapping for ransom is a third world crime.  It&rsquo;s almost totally dead in America because kidnappers are almost always caught.  The trouble starts when you have a culture that makes kidnapping possible.  Third world police and governments are corrupt and underfunded, so people are on their own to deal with kidnappings.  Kidnapping is a non-starter for 1st world countries and populations.  So obviously this is just Mexicans looking for a better life, doing jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do.</p>

Goodbye Page 1  Baby Charlie Lindbergh. Does that fact that they call it an &#8220;ATM&#8221; kidnapping in Mexico give you any ideas on how common it is there?!? Like Whiteplight said the other day, &#8220;There will come a time when people just take what they want and need. Will you be ready?</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was Phoenix, after all: More ransom kidnappings happen here than in any other town in America, according to local and federal law enforcement authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many people in this country realize this is happening?  How many know that a substantial number of politicians and police are on the drug cartel payrolls on this side of the border?  How many people here are aware that this threat is growing by the day, and as the economy continues to go south it will be only the drug business that will be earning huge dollars and, in many cases, the only business making any money at all? How easy will it be for them to increase their numbers in the US, when jobs are impossible to find?</p>
<p>How much has the MSM covered this very real and growing threat?  And because of their incompetence, how many people here are in a state of ignorant denial that we even have a drug cartel problem?  Are they aware that the economic downturn is hurting Mexico even worse than the US, which opens the door for cartel takeover, because they&rsquo;re apt to have more money than the government?  </p>
<p>I saw one very bright economist on a news show yesterday talking about a possible revolution in this country about 2012, because of the chaos created by the depression.  He said he has received much criticism from people who are asking him why he can&rsquo;t put a happier face on his analysis, and he said he&rsquo;s not going to compromise his priciples of honesty in order to get more business and that more people should be like Patrick Henry who preferred to hear the truth no matter how much pain it caused them in order to prepare for it: </p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren, till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?<br>
 <br>
&#8220;For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth   &mdash;   to know the worst and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House?&#8221; </p>
<p>And as the cartels get stronger ever day they will move even more drugs and people into the US or just hire the ones already here.  Soon the Southwest, along the border, will be no different than the Mexican border towns.  Many US politicians are in pay of the drug gangs right this minute.</p>
<p>This is part of just a bit of the bad news.  The good news, in my opinion, is that the New World order is starting to crack badly, and right wing groups are gaining in stregth, slowly but surely, all over the West.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t see a real suge, however, until we get further into this debacle, but it will materialize, and that fact is an absolute nightmare to the leftist ideologues everywhere who can see it coming.</p>

<p>GREAT POINT, Tim McHugh. If every White American had the good sense to own and know how to use handguns, rifles and shotguns&hellip; keeping them readily accessible in their home for emergencies&hellip; crimes like home invasions, burglaries, etc., would become a risky business for the bad guys.</p>
<p>I am ready. No, I am NOT, nor do I recommend, trying to be a Rambo. But I firmly believe self-defense is ultimately our own responsibility. That a 911 call when you hear glass breaking or a door being forced&hellip; may not bring fast enough help from the local law enforcement agency. That having a carefully hidden but readily accessible LOADED handgun available&hellip; can save the lives of your loved ones and yourself!</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake, American people. WAKE UP! We have 30 to 35 MILLION illegal aliens in our country&hellip; and only a small fraction of that number are the decent, law-abiding citizens simply here to &#8220;better themselves&#8221;, as we&rsquo;re told to believe.</p>
<p>The simple truth is Latino gangs are active EVERYWHERE! They see us as fair targets (Americans are feelthy rich!) and only a fool thinks himself safely isolated from crime. Here in the Houston area, home invasions are almost a daily fare in our local news.</p>

			<p>While the article concedes &#8220;Phoenix had long been a destination for Mexican immigrants, and for Sinaloans in particular&#8221; it makes a determined effort NOT IMPLY those immigrants invariably are ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! But I&rsquo;m sure the writer of this article is smart enough to realize most Americans don&rsquo;t have brains enough to figure that one out for themselves. After all, Americans have been told repeatedly that immigration is GOOD for Americans. That our economy DEPENDS on illegal immigration. That illegal immigrants are only &#8220;good people, coming to better themselves.&#8221; Right?</p>

			<p>Kidnapping for ransom is (or was) a relatively rare crime in the USA. The FBI does not list it as a Part I offense. This has been so since the national revulsion over the Lindbergh baby kidnapping way back when.</p>
<p>One thing that drives various types of crimes is the willingness of the general public to accept certain kinds of behavior. Kidnapping for ransom, or for political purposes, is very common in much of Latin America. What we are seeing is an extension of Hispanic criminal culture into the United States. It is another part of the transformation of the USA brought about by mass illegal immigration.</p>

			<p> Yes, the culture of poverty, corruption and crime is coming out of Mexico to a city near you. Will the recession cut down on the number of criminal migrants? On the contrary, it will only increase. Phoenix used to be a popular destination for Northern retirees, now it is popular destination for Mexican Narco-Terrorists. You can thank the controlled media and our privileged elites for this avoidable catastrophe.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s gigantic mess. The Mexican Mafia teams up with the Mexican Narcos to flood the streets of the Southwest with drugs and guns. Makes me sick to even think of it. All the problems in Mexico are starting to playing out here in a big way and we almost powerless now to do anything about it. And our politicans just want to give them all amnesty and keep the spigot open.</p>
