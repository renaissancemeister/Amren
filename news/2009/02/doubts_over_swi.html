			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, February 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Brazilian woman who said she miscarried twins after an alleged racist attack in Zurich was not pregnant, investigators have said.</p>
<p>Paula Oliveira, a 26-year-old lawyer, had said she was attacked by three knife-wielding skinheads on Monday.</p>
<p>However, medical experts said she was not pregnant, and that it was possible the numerous wounds on her torso and legs were self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Brazil had expressed concern to Swiss officials over the incident.</p>
<p>Forensic chief</p>
<p>Photos of Ms Oliveira showed her stomach and legs with some 100 cuts from a carpet knife, and the initials of the right-wing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party (SVP) carved into her body.</p>
<p>Inquiries are continuing, but Zurich University forensic medicine chief Walter Baer said &#8220;any experienced forensic doctor would not hesitate to assume that this was a case of self-infliction&#8221;.</p>
<p>All of the wounds were reachable by hand, and none were severe, he said.</p>
<p>Ms Oliveira said she had been speaking Portuguese outside a Zurich train station shortly before the attack.</p>
<p>Reports of the alleged attack had caused shock in Brazil where it had been widely reported along with graphic images of the wounds inflicted on Ms Oliveira.</p>
<p>Brazil&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim had described the assault as &#8220;grave&#8221; and &#8220;shocking&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Well well, what a surprise.</p>
<p>The BBC reported this earlier as a &#8220;race&#8221; attack, yet it is pretty clear from the photos that this woman was very light-skinned and Caucasian in appearance.  </p>
<p>Perhaps in implicit acknowledgment of this, the story mentions she was &#8220;speaking Portuguese,&#8221; yet to a German speaker (this is Zurich) Portuguese would be nearly indistinguishable from Spanish and maybe even Italian.  All of which are European languages anyways.  Point being, you don&rsquo;t need a forensic expert to tell you that this story doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>

		<p>People, especially the mentally unstable, will do anything for sympathy.   What surprises me much more is that the BBC published this.<br>
By the way, I wonder what this Brazilian lawyer was doing in Switzerland.</p>

		<p>Another embarrassingly obvious hoax. Please, those marks were so uniform and neat, a child could see through this blatant chicanery. Yet, I am sure many, many Whites were eager to believe weren&rsquo;t they? Those who hate themselves love any opportunity to self-flagelate!! </p>

		<p>When all else fails blame &#8220;skinheads, nazis, White Supremacists&#8221; even though they know t was a hoax&hellip;Will it be labeled a HOAX in bold letters in their next edition on the FRONT page? Of course not. So most readers who read of the &#8220;incident&#8221; will automatically have it in their minds it was Skinheads who did the dirty deed. I believe that is their goal in the first place.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wounds&#8221;? These are scratches. The hoax is so painfully obvious I cannot understand why they even dared show the picture in Brazil (where the audience should know what wounds look like. But if it´s big bad evil whitey&hellip;)<br>
Skinheads never use carpet knives. They have always been the weapon of the lefties and psychos. OK, some skins were in love with their butterfly. And the girls carried straight razors (referring to them as &#8220;their right to say no&#8221;. A man using a razor would have his hand broken as a matter of course. But then, those were different times.)</p>
<p>A few questions remain:<br>
1) Was she awaiting deportation?<br>
2) As it is not clear what business she had there in the first place, what are her contacts to, erm, &#8220;immigrants´rights&#8221; organizations?<br>
3) How much is the Brazilian government going to pay to the SVP in damages?<br>
4) How much longer is it going to take until hate crime hoaxes are prosecuted as hate crimes? (short of abolishing this obvious fraud altogether)</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s some more for you&hellip;.<br>
Who was the father of those alleged twins that miscarried? Was she even married?  Is she even a lawyer? For whom is she working?<br>

		<p>Even the Jewish Telegraphic Agency is carrying the story that it may be a hoax:<br>

 &#8220;All of the wounds were reachable by hand and none were severe, he said. Areas particularly sensitive for women - the breasts, navel and outer genitals - were not injured, he added..&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Paula Oliveira legally lives and works as a lawyer in Switzerland&#8221;.<br>
Probably an activist who hates Whites. </p>

		<p>So, SVP was scratched on her tummy?  Sounds like a great idea!  I think I&rsquo;d like a tattoo of that on my chest, along with BNP, and one for each of the nationalist parties in Europe!  You know, diversity?</p>

		<p>I am a Swiss national. Whenever there is an opportunity to swing the rassist or holocaust bat, the local media happily comply. Too bad, it happend to be a hoax this time. No suprise here, but what really upsets me is the outcry of the Brasilian media including their government over this ridicules incident! Brasilians have been living in Zurich freely and safely for decades, much more so than in their own home country and you would think the Swiss government would step in and send a protest note to the Brasilians.<br>
A small incident like this speaks pages about my spine less government.</p>

Will she be deported?</p>
<p>Or will all this be excused, forgotten, and she&rsquo;ll be allowed to remain?</p>

		<p>At the very least, she should be charged with making a false police report and also detained on a psychiactric hold until doctors pronounce her fit to be released.  Since she&rsquo;s shown she&rsquo;s willing to hurt herself, I think the discomfort of a suicide watch under complete restraint would be advisable.</p>
