<h1>The Rise of the Right: Europe&rsquo;s Scary Solution to Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Handan T. Satiroglu, Alternet, January 29, 2009.</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>If the old face of the Far-Right in Europe resembled that of a combative fascist, these new ordinary faces put those images to rest. Gone are the days when support for the radical right came from neo-Nazi elements in European society; they now come from ordinary citizens, concerned not only about bleeding social welfare programs, but also from worries about the continued influx of immigration  &mdash;  a feeling that is likely to worsen as recession hangs over the continent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I voted for the Freedom Party to stop immigrants from burdening our social welfare system,&#8221; says Lukas, a grandfatherly figure and government employee. A former supporter of the Social Democrats, he gestures towards the rushing pedestrians outside the café, &#8220;Austria has inhaled enough people. We are full.&#8221;</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, 35 year old Brigitte, a nurse practitioner who is proud to have led a major campaign in her neighborhood against the expansion of an Islamic center, claims, &#8220;the center already attracts hordes of people a day, and causes enough problems with congestion.&#8221; Poised and confident, she continues: &#8220;The people who use the Islamic center do not try to integrate into society, or even socialize with us. None of the other parties would hear our concerns.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That&rsquo;s why we voted for Heinz-Christian Strache.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not too far from the café, a mural reads: &#8220;Arab, go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such is the dynamic in today&rsquo;s European race relations. A December Pew Research Center&rsquo;s Global Attitudes Project reports anti-immigrant, and especially anti-Muslim sentiments, to be growing steadily across the continent. Noting that the increase in Muslim prejudice has occurred over a period of decades, the report claims that nearly 52 percent of Spaniards expressed a negative opinion of Muslims  &mdash;  a view echoed by 50 percent of Germans, 46 percent of Poles, and 38 percent of French people. According to an April Georgetown University report, 67 percent of Dutch, and 80 percent of Danes agree with the statement, &#8220;the growing interaction between the Muslim world and the West is a menace to freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once a welcoming multicultural haven, Denmark&rsquo;s voters have given the Danish People&rsquo;s Party its fourth consecutive hike in voting share, making it the third largest party in Europe. In Switzerland where the foreign-born population hovers around 20 percent, the nationalist Swiss People&rsquo;s Party regularly receives 29 percent of the vote; in France, Nicolas Sarkozy grabbed the presidency after mimicking the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the unforgiving nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen. Netherlands, Sweden and Italy have all witnessed the rise of conservative discourse, while the second largest party in Norway runs on an anti-immigrant platform. And if there is anything that the Flemish and Walloons of Belgium can agree upon, it is the curtailment of the progressive Islamization of their society.</p>
<p>The term Islamization has gained much popularity in recent years, especially in the right-wing media. As European Muslims demand more mosques, state-funded Islamic schools, and even the implementation of Sharia (Islamic law) in their host countries, the term refers to the gradual process by which European society is becoming increasingly and visibly Muslim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In just three short decades, Islam has moved from essentially being a nonfactor to a religion that challenges the European identity. Perhaps nothing illustrates this change more graphically than the omnipresent symbols of Islam sprinkled across European cities and towns: state-funded Islamic schools, halal butcher shops, Arabic signs in store fronts, ladies in burqas and headscarves, Turkish or Moroccan flags fluttering over residential buildings. Sharia courts have already been adopted in many cities in the UK after persistent demands by British Muslims.</p>
<p>Indeed, the sheer number of Muslim immigrants sheds some light on the newfound fear of the &#8220;bewildering Islamic cacophony,&#8221; as Johann Hari in a Dissent magazine article sardonically put it. By varying estimates, the European Union is now home to 15-20 million Muslims, with France hosting the largest number. Annually, half a million migrants flood the gates of Europe in search of work and an additional 400,000 seek asylum, many of whom are from the Middle East. Added to this mix, is the influx of between 120,000 to 500,000 undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>High immigration from Muslim nations, combined with fertility advantages, means that ethnic Europeans might lose their demographic counterpoise: a fact that touches a raw nerve with many. {snip} With a Muslim population that is expected to grow to 40-50 million by 2050, the populations of major European cities would be half non-native within two generations.</p>
<p>Seizing on these numbers, Bernard Lewis, a leading historian on Islam, argues that Europe would complete its transformation into &#8220;Eurabia&#8221; by the end of the 21st century. Italy&rsquo;s flamboyant and controversial journalist Oriana Fallaci once lamented that their province was falling prey to &#8216;a colony of Islam&rsquo;  &mdash;  whereby a sense of surrender of fundamental European values such as freedom of expression and democracy were being felt.</p>
<p>The sense that Europe is under siege is further heightened by concerns over the welfare system being overtaxed by non-natives. American Bruce Bawer gave voice to these concerns in his book While Europe Slept, using statistics primarily from Nordic countries to highlight the issue of welfare dependency. In Denmark, for instance, he writes that immigrants from the Middle East &#8220;make up 5 percent of the population but receive 40 percent of welfare outlays&#8221;  &mdash;  among them public assistance, unemployment benefits, relief payments, child benefits, disability, cash support, and rent allowance. Statistics for other countries are comparable.</p>
<p>According to Bawer, about 15 percent of the Moroccan émigrés in Norway are on a disability plan when a quarter of them have actually returned to their own country. The Frisch Center for Socio-economic Research study, supported by the University of Oslo, also claims that as many as 50 percent of immigrants are &#8220;caught up in various forms of welfare benefits.&#8221; Further south in the Netherlands, rising unemployment rates have left 33 percent of the foreign-born population out of the labor market  &mdash;  and thus dependent on the welfare system, while unemployed Belgians and migrants have found themselves competing for the lower-end subsidized housing market. Pressure from national authorities to use objective criteria when placing individuals in government housing has meant that migrants, due in part to their larger families, lower wages and high unemployment rates, tend to qualify for housing before Belgians.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly then, unemployment, insecurity and concerns about welfare burdens have been the vote-winning themes for the extreme right on the continent. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism has, in practice, been a dismal failure,&#8221; says Esman [Abigail Esman, an American writer based in the Netherlands who specializes in writing on radical Islam and post-9/11 political tensions in the West]. Indeed, the integration of Europe&rsquo;s new arrivals from non-Western cultures stands out as one of the greatest challenges facing European governments in contemporary times  &mdash;  a challenge that a growing body of citizens feel mainstream parties have not dealt with effectively. And insofar as left or centrist governments do not debate the limits and/or confines of multiculturalism, or take measures to fully integrate non-Western cultures into the &#8216;European identity&rsquo; to become fully at home in their host countries, we can expect individuals of all persuasions to flock to the far-right (whom they perceive as having &#8220;commonsensical&#8221; approaches to these issues.)</p>
<p>Though I don&rsquo;t personally believe the far-right is a panacea to the continent&rsquo;s woes, I do believe the time has come for a new kind of politics, not necessarily far-left or far-right, but politics that genuinely represent the interests and concerns of citizens; politics that make the diversity of Europe work. {snip}<br>

								<h2><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article5621482.ece">Muslim Population &lsquo;Rising 10 Times Faster Than Rest of Society&rsquo;</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Times of London, January 30, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Muslim population in Britain has grown by more than 500,000 to 2.4 million in just four years, according to official research collated for The Times.</p>
<p>The population multiplied 10 times faster than the rest of society, the research by the Office for National Statistics reveals. In the same period the number of Christians in the country fell by more than 2 million.</p>
<p>Experts said that the increase was attributable to immigration, a higher birthrate and conversions to Islam during the period of 2004-2008, when the data was gathered. They said that it also suggested a growing willingness among believers to describe themselves as Muslims because the western reaction to war and terrorism had strengthened their sense of identity.</p>
<p>Muslim leaders have welcomed the growing population of their communities as academics highlighted the implications for British society, integration and government resources.</p>
<p>David Coleman, Professor of Demography at Oxford University, said: &#8220;The implications are very substantial. Some of the Muslim population, by no means all of them, are the least socially and economically integrated of any in the United Kingdom &hellip; and the one most associated with political dissatisfaction. You can&rsquo;t assume that just because the numbers are increasing that all will increase, but it will be one of several reasonable suppositions that might arise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Coleman said that Muslims would naturally reap collective benefits from the increase in population. &#8220;In the growth of any population &hellip; [its] voice is regarded as being stronger in terms of formulating policy, not least because we live in a democracy where most people in most religious groups and most racial groups have votes. That necessarily means their opinions have to be taken and attention to be paid to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are more than 42.6 million Christians in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics, whose figures were obtained through the quarterly Labour Force Survey of around 53,000 homes. But while the biggest Christian population is among over-70s bracket, for Muslims it is the under-4s.</p>
<p>Ceri Peach, Professor of Social Geography at Manchester University, said that the rapid growth of the Muslim population posed challenges for society. &#8220;The groups with the strongest belief in the family and cohesion are those such as the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. They have got extremely strong family values but it goes together with the sort of honour society and other kinds of attributes which people object to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So you are dealing with a pretty complex situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Peach said that the high number of Muslims under the age of 4  &mdash;  301,000 as of September last year  &mdash;  would benefit Britain&rsquo;s future labour market through taxes that would subsequently contribute to sustaining the country&rsquo;s ageing population. He added, though, that it would also put pressure on housing and create a growing demand for schools. &#8220;I think housing has traditionally been a difficulty because the country is simultaneously short of labour and short of housing. So if you get people to fill vacancies in your labour force you also need to find places for them to live,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Muhammad Abdul Bari, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, predicted that the number of mosques in Britain would multiply from the present 1,600 in line with the rising Islamic population. He said the greater platform that Muslims would command in the future should not be perceived as a threat to the rest of society.</p>
<p>&#8220;We each have our own set of beliefs. This should really be a source of celebration rather than fear as long as we all clearly understand that we must abide by the laws of this country regardless of the faith we belong to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Cohesion Minister, Sadiq Khan, told The Times: &#8220;We in central Government and local authorities need to continue our work to ensure that our communities are as integrated and cohesive as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Growing numbers</b></p>

			<p>I had a quick but falsely reassuring thought a moment ago. For just a second I thought that Austria and Denmark and the rest  could seal their  borders, then limit population among the natives to enjoy an uncrowded country. But then I rembered that birth rates of immigrants of another stock might deluge them without the painful admission of failure and beginning of repatriation&hellip;</p>

			<p>This is an unusually balanced and relatively free of invective article from Alter Net, which is usually as shrill and hateful as the far left can get.  If this were written about American anti-invasion activists, it wouldn&rsquo;t be this kind (keeping in mind this is Alter Net).  Why?</p>

			<p>Suffice to say, &#8220;AlterNet&#8221; is a Leftist rag, so I&rsquo;m quite surprised at the lack of the word &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>Once a <b>welcoming multicultural haven</b>, Denmark&rsquo;s voters have given the Danish People&rsquo;s Party its fourth consecutive hike in voting share, making it the third largest party in Europe.</i></p>
<p>A &#8220;welcoming multicultural haven&#8221; is any location, town, region or nation where non-white minorities form less than 5% of the population.</p>
<p>However, this just reinforces that - contrary to the belief of white Leftists and liberals - <b>&#8220;racism&#8221; <i>increases</i> with ethnic diversity, not <i>decreases</i></b>:<br>
If &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; are so good for us (for lack of better terminology) &#8220;whitebread&#8221; whites, why are so many &#8220;far-Right&#8221; parties making such great successes in Europe?</p>
<p>But anyway, the article is simply stating what any reader of American Renaissance knows:<br>
1. Islam was, is and will always be a threat to the varied cultures, races and ideas that Europe represents.<br>
2. Non-white immigrants are a burden on European economies - handed jobs instead of the indigenous Europeans and consuming large numbers of welfare benefits.<br>
3. Europeans of all nations are slowly awakening to the fact that their &#8220;Centre&#8221; parties do not, and never will, give a damn about their respective indigenous people</p>

			<p>&#8220;immigrants from the Middle East &ldquo;make up 5 percent of the population but receive 40 percent of welfare outlays&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Where are the good folks who insist everything must be equal? And whenever things are not, that this is proof of racism and evil. Isn&rsquo;t social services their very stronghold? Where they hold the most power, clout and sway?</p>
<p>It would seem it is under the lefts very noses that things are the most unequal. In my experience, that&rsquo;s the way it always works. I don&rsquo;t believe my perception is inaccurate. Perhaps they need to discover there is a white race that exists for something other than naming the oppressor. </p>

			<p>The countries that are dumping their surplus population in Western nations will continue to do so&hellip;.UNTIL&hellip;.the Western nations begin to take the welfare-seeking foreign citizens to the embassy of their own home country. Western nations must insist that these unemployed (and unemployable) foreign citizens be removed to their own embassy for transportation home.</p>
<p>When foreign governments must foot the bill for transporting the hoards back to their own country, they may make an effort to avoid that expense by discouraging their citizens from making the trip. Until that happens, the foreign governments will continue to encourage illegal immigration.<br>

			<p> What&rsquo;s this about &#8220;combative fascists&#8221; and &#8220;neo-Nazi elements&#8221;? The fascists and Nazis, in their day-to-day lives, were just ordinary citizens, mostly working-class. But yes, most of the rest of this article is on the money. Why shouldn&rsquo;t Europeans be distressed at seeing their (relatively) homogeneous societies diluted, and at alien foreigners sopping up most of the welfare benefits, especially at a time of rapidly worsening economies? Does this make them vile, evil racists? Of course not.</p>
<p> Import millions of Arab or North African Muslims into China, and see how the Chinese would react. They wouldn&rsquo;t welcome them with open arms, I guarantee you that. And when the Chinese have a big project they want to undertake somewhere in Africa, where their economic influence is growing rapidly, do they hire Africans to do the stoop labor? No, they do not. They import enough ethnic Chinese laborers to handle it. Why? Because they see the Africans as lazy and unreliable. Is that racist? Oh, sorry, I forgot: Only White people can be racist.</p>

			<p>All of us who where alive in the 70&rsquo;s remembers the &#8220;indigenious rights&#8221; talk.  In fact it is still around.  I think the Europeans need to start refering to themselves as the indigenious popluation and start demanding protection.  I have only read once, in the Economist Magazine of all places, the term indigenious be applied to Europeans.  My guess is the same left wing hippies that are so gung ho about it won&rsquo;t say peep when whitey does it.  What could they do?</p>

			<p>Leftists just can&rsquo;t understand why &#8220;ordinary&#8221; white people*  &mdash;  people who theoretically &#8220;should&#8221; be voting them  &mdash;  are now supporting so-called right-wing parties. It&rsquo;s all a big mystery to them. But then again they&rsquo;ve always had trouble understanding any kind of rational self-interested behavior. That&rsquo;s what makes them leftists. </p>
<p>*Ordinary white people haven&rsquo;t even begun to think about who they should be voting for, they&rsquo;re too buisy trying to make up their mind about who should be the next American Idol.  </p>

			<p>Mulitculturalism is a dismal failure and muslims do constitute a threat to western values if their numbers get large enough. This is fact, common sense, it is not &#8220;far-right&#8221;, a term that is just a smear tactic by the multicult supporters.</p>

			<p>Well, I enjoyed the first article until I read the last sentence (the last sentence in the article as shown here on Amren).  The last sentence defeats the whole purpose and zeal of the rest of the article.  The thing to take home here, is that whether or not this author agrees, the people of Europe obviously want the Muslims out.  End of story.</p>

			<p>If the left is so upset that the &#8220;far right&#8221; is having so much success w/this winning issue, then why not steal it from them?</p>
<p>They could win more votes, and more importantly, save their countries from turning into Islamofascist police states. But do they really want to stop that from happening? </p>

			<p>Absolute, shear madness. Muslims have no intention of assimilating into host countries. They are their to bleed them dry and then change them into Islamic societies with them ruling over non-muslims. And the elitists that run these European societies are so out of touch with reality that they think these muslims are going to work and be taxed to support their aging white populations. Complete folly.</p>

<p>I agree that the generally reasonable tone can be attributed the article being about Europe, and confining itself to culture not race.  That&rsquo;s the tone these articles usually take when writing about &#8220;somewhere else.&#8221;  But they typically wrap it up with something reassuring about &#8220;this why the nativists are wrong and why they&rsquo;ll lose.&#8221;  Even the wrap-up in this case kind of tepid.  Perhaps there&rsquo;s a dawning sense that everything the evil-far-right has been saying is pretty much correct   &mdash;   a message sadly too often drowned out by the shrillness of the loony-far-right wing.</p>
<p><i>Well, I enjoyed the first article until I read the last sentence (the last sentence in the article as shown here on Amren).

<p>When I first read that sentence, I thought it was a quote from some Euroskeptic.  I see that it&rsquo;s the author&rsquo;s own thoughts.  Well, she&rsquo;s a Turkish Muslim (prob not a serious one if she&rsquo;s writing for Alternet   &mdash;   though muslims do take advantage of loony-leftism), so it&rsquo;s no surprise she&rsquo;d conclude with some silly line about making diversity work   &mdash;   as though that hasn&rsquo;t been tried already and found severely wanting.</p>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a welcome sign if the loony lefties are beginning to wake up and almost (but not quite, not yet) advance what is virtually a &#8220;neo-con&#8221; position   &mdash;   assimilation.  Used to be what passed for &#8220;conservatism&#8221; was the &#8220;liberalism&#8221; of about 20 years earlier.  I wonder if that might be reversed, and what passes for liberalism is what &#8220;neocons&#8221; were babbling about earlier, while the debate has left both behind and swung massively right.</p>

			<p>Are the old European Leftists beginning to wake up?  Time will tell, but not too much time, please.  If European nations don&rsquo;t begin to repatriate Muslims back to their vaste lands filled with oil reserves and force their despotic rulers to share in this generation - now - in this moment, the next generation will be too late.</p>

			<p>If I am not mistaken, Germany hasn&rsquo;t given citizenship to most of the muslim immigrants there.  They have always been guest workers.  30-40 years ago, they were horrible racists, now they are about the only ones that can legally deport their foreign detritus.  Lucky them.  </p>

<p>The entire European continent has been racked with rioting many times over, their jails, prisons and courts are becoming filled with third world rabble, there are many parts of large cities where whites can not longer enter, but worst of all they&rsquo;ve had home grown terrorists bombing and killing native civilians with the preaching of hate against countries, traditions, inhabitants, and religion, and yet the addled minded fool who wrote this piece is so ignorant he regards policies in opposition to all that as &#8220;scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Europe, like all the West, is in extreme decline as never before in history, and the writers and reporters of the West are naive, gullible fools who have been taught to hate themselves and their countries.</p>
<p>Maybe this economic collapse has come just in time to destroy our counbtries and save us from the hordes who want to take over what we have built.</p>
<p>The good thing about poverty is that nobody fights and schemes and goes to great lengths to get a piece of it.</p>

			<p>As the older WW2 generation die off, attitudes toward the triumphalist liberalism that this war spawned are beginning to wear thin.  It was always something of a &#8220;respectful bow&#8221; that we did toward our elders because of their sacrifices in that war.  But as that generation disappears, subsequent generations are facing the harsh reality that the early race realists back in the 1920s were warning about.  Too bad the post-war reaction against anti-semitism obscured the huge danger posed by non-European immigration.  I just don&rsquo;t see a peaceful outcome for Europe.  Non-Europeans cannot remain in Europe in concentrated numbers.  They must be expelled.  How without violent clashes with the far left?  </p>

			<p>Linking right wing, conservative views, with the concept of Nazism, has been a very successful strategy of the far left for years. I really applaud them in their success in using this psychological ploy on Americans. Where the &#8220;right&#8221; went wrong for so long, was that they never came back at the leftists with the accusation, over and over again, that they are communists and Stalinists at heart. Conservatives need to destroy the leftist&rsquo;s accusations that political parties other than the Democratic Party,are synonymous with Nazism. National Socialism was a political movement that was born in another time and another place, because of the unique circumstances of that time and place. It has nothing to do with the United States, it never did, and the clowns that are part of the so called American Nazi Party are just that  &mdash;  CLOWNS. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped the left from brainwashing people about conservatives.  </p>

    One has to assume writers know what they&rsquo;re doing. To keep<br>
to the status quo is deliver Europe into Muslim hands. The writer<br>
wants a new politics! Yeah the writer really wants a new popul-<br>

of success to Islam. The Europeans are paying for their own dem-<br>

			<p>Europeans are joining these &#8220;extremist&#8221; parties because the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; parties have resorted to the extremist policy of outlawing criticism of immigration and multiculturalism. Voters have decided that if an &#8220;extreme&#8221; party is the only party that will answer their concerns then they&rsquo;ll take it. Even when a politician from a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; party who is supposedly sane on immigration gets elected, he backtracks. Witness Gov. Rick Perry in Texas, Steven Harper in Canada, and John Howard in Australia.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Scary&#8221; is how I term continued non-white immigration into Europe; and Europeans being forced to subsidize their own displacement.  The Europeans should be terrified - and terrified people will increasingly seek out more extreme solutions.  Even Alternet can&rsquo;t keep up the charade any longer: &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is the enemy of peaceful liberalism.  Put two and two together people.    </p>

			<p>Just like we are learning SLOWLY in the US, Muslims take over via reproduction, same with blacks AND mexicans. After they are the majority, all rights disappear, unless you are the right color/ religion. Without restraints on birth numbers, it becomes rampant. Look at California. It&rsquo;s been that way there since the 70&rsquo;s and is so bad that they are completely bankrupt, from having an overburdened welfare, prison, etc. systems. And as we can see all throughout the US, it is quickly spreading.<br>

			<p>The shocking fact garnered from reading this article is the extremely high level of welfare (ie taxpayer)dependence of non-White immigrants into the nordic countries.<br>
  This gives the lie to the oft-quoted claim that mass immigration is &#8216;needed&rsquo;in order for western governments to &#8216;boost economic growth&rsquo; and &#8216;pay for social security&rsquo;.<br>
  These important facts need to disseminated more widely and used as couterpoints in all arguments involving immigration.</p>

			<p>British authorities were insisting up to a few months ago that there were &#8216;only&rsquo; 1.5 million muslims in the UK (a figure that hadn&rsquo;t altered since 1978), and many correspondents here said that this claim was obviously absurd.<br>
 Now, in the space of a year it has magicked up to 2.4 million, which again I think is absurdly low.<br>
 Anyway, from government statistics it appears that 10% of births are now to muslims - this of course implies that around 30% of births in Britain today are to non-Whites.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Professor Peach said that the high number of Muslims under the age of 4 &mdash; 301,000 as of September last year &mdash; would benefit Britain&rsquo;s future labour market through taxes that would subsequently contribute to sustaining the country&rsquo;s ageing population.&#8221;<br>
Utter delusion from the professor. The mass of these children will end up poorly qualified and with very limited earning power: all their lives many will be an economic burden with their limited contributions to tax and social security making them lifelong net recipients of tax revenue, directly and indirectly. An economic ball and chain for the general population. </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that it&rsquo;s taken 70 years of multi-culturalism for the Left to finally start looking at the evil Nazi policies toward immigration restriction and protecting their native genetic stock as essential to a nation&rsquo;s health and future?  But it wasn&rsquo;t just the Nazis who had restrictive immigration policies  &mdash;  many european countries did, along with the U.S.A.  </p>
<p>Before 1965&rsquo;s Immigration Reform Act, we here in the United States had a reasonable immigration policy that allowed, by and large, immigration from only White European countries.  Those who fought against this &#8216;racist&rsquo; policy labeled its supporters as &#8216;fascists&rsquo;, &#8216;bigots&rsquo;, and of course, &#8216;neo-nazis&rsquo;.  Look at this country and europe now, just to see how dangerous it is to allow Leftists to indiscriminately throw those negative labels around just to get what they want.</p>
<p>The Left loves to calls us &#8216;extremists&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;d like to think of ourselves here at AmRen as reasonable, moral, unselfish, forward-thinking, and racially-conscious, and reality-based.  </p>

			<p>I am in total agreement with RHG above. These Muslims are on their &#8220;best behavior&#8221; now and want to appear to not &#8220;rock the boat&#8221; too suddenly, so as not to alert the elites they pose a threat to the host country. <br>
Wait until they become a much larger number. Then by their sheer numbers, they&rsquo;ll be able to DEMAND whatever they want or threaten violence. I feel this is an absolute certainty and they have openly stated their goals! <br>
Why the ruling elites don&rsquo;t have any nationalist identity to stop this madness is beyond me. I have always been amazed at how Europeans - all of them it seems - have been overly eager to surrender their culture to the Muslims, who have openly stated their intentions: to dominate and conquer Western civilization.<br>
By the time the elites see what they&rsquo;ve done it will be too late to save their society, race and culture. Then the majority(indigenous) Europeans will have convinced them they were right all along, but alas, it will be too late to salvage their country. The non-White Muslims will call the shots.<br>
Looks like we&rsquo;ll lose England first - and it won&rsquo;t be long. </p>

			<p>From National Statististics:<br>
&#8220;In 2004, Muslims had the highest male unemployment rate in Great Britain, at 13 per cent. This was about three times the rate for Christian men (4 per cent). Unemployment rates for men in the other religious groups were between 3 and 8 per cent.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for Muslim women at 18 per cent was about four times the rate for Christian and Jewish women (4 per cent in each case). Unemployment rates for women in the other religious groups were between 6 per cent and 9 per cent.</p>
<p>Unemployment rates were highest among those aged under 25 years for all religious groups. Muslims aged 16 to 24 years had the highest unemployment rates. They were over twice as likely as Christians of the same age to be unemployed – 28 per cent compared with 11 per cent. </p>
<p>Although unemployment rates for older Muslims were lower, there was a greater difference between their unemployment rates and those for people from other religious backgrounds. Muslims aged 25 and over were more than three times as likely as Christians of the same age to be unemployed – 11 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.Men and women of working age from the Muslim faith are also more likely than other groups in Great Britain to be economically inactive, that is, not available for work and/or not actively seeking work. Reasons include being a student, being disabled or looking after the family and home. </p>
<p>Among working age men, Muslims had the highest overall levels of economic inactivity in 2004 – 31 per cent compared with 16 per cent of Christians. This is partly explained by the young age profile of Muslims and the correspondingly high proportion of students. However, among older men of working age, Muslims also tended to have the highest levels of economic inactivity, largely due to ill health. </p>
<p>Within each religious group women were more likely than men to be economically inactive. The main reason was that they were looking after the family and home. Muslim women were more likely than other women to be economically inactive. About seven in ten (69 per cent) Muslim women of working age were economically inactive, compared with no more than four in ten women of working age in each of the other groups. Christian women were least likely to be economically inactive (25 per cent).<br>
 <br>
In 2004 a third (33 per cent) of Muslims of working age in Great Britain had no qualifications – the highest proportion for any religious group. They were also the least likely to have degrees or equivalent qualifications (12 per cent).&#8221;<br>
(Source: Annual Population Survey, January 2004 to December 2004, Office for National Statistics) </p>
<p>If you want any more information simply Google unemployment Muslims UK. Most people migrate to another country for a better job and higher standard of living. It appears that Muslim diasporas just migrate for a  higher standard of living&hellip;.the job comes a long way down the list; leaving plenty of time left over for protest, self-perpetuated &#8216;alienation&rsquo;, and complaint.<br>

<p>&#8220;Once&#8221;???   When was that?  </p>
<p>Well, I can remember BEFORE it became welcoming.   Back around 1970, I knew a co-worker who had visited Denmark and fell in love with it. In fact, he liked it so much that he decided he wanted to move there.  He visited the Danish embassy and inquired about doing so.  He was politely rebuffed with the firm anwer that Denmark is a  very old country, already well populated,  and was <b><i>not open to immigration. </i></b>  </p>
<p>Well, that was THEN, before all the white countries were thrown open to immigration. Back then, not even whites could immigrate.</p>

			<p>Several observations and points:<br>
Europe has been subject to a constantly increasing but relatively slow process of demographic shift towards an increasing large Muslim population.  In this sense it may be said to have been like the proverbial frog left in a slowly heating boil of water.  It felt good to warm up for a while (the European sense of being superior to those American racists) but there does inevitably come a point at which the water temperature in no longer pleasant and some frogs will then jump out.  Will the Europeans jump out or stay put and boil to death?  My personal guess is that increasingly more of them are beginning to realize the real situation and a major conflict is on the horizon.  Such is not the case in the US as we have in place currently a government dedicated to not only &#8220;diversity&#8221; but equality of income through redistribution (something far more leftist than anything we have seen in Europe for decades). <br>
It is for many of us difficult to remember when our country was not a cesse pool of diversity, when the waitress at the cafeteria was a decent working class white woman, not her black equivalent with an IQ dramatically lower and an attitude to match it.  I was recently in Colorado on a business trip and stayed in a town an hour&rsquo;s drive from Denver.  The most remarkable feature of my stay was the sense that something was unusually right with the place.  I rarely, if ever, met a black during my entire stay and distinctly recall going to the hospital cafeteria and being served my lunch by a remarkably friendly middle aged white woman who was clearly proud of her work.  Then I consulted the internet to discover the reason for my happy experience.  The county I was in had only 0.81% blacks.<br>
It was the world of my childhood rediscovered and it was a pure pleasure.</p>

<p>I find it regrettable that women who are keeping a home and raising children are dismissively termed &#8220;economically inactive&#8221;.<br>
Maybe they&rsquo;re not paid (maybe they should be?) but raising a family is a big job. And a very important job. They deserve more respect. Maybe that&rsquo;s one of our problems&hellip;the low regard for motherhood.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad to hear this better than the rest of Alternet, which I never read   &mdash;   because this is pure drivel as reportage. It&rsquo;s pure, concentrated bleeding-heart liberal propaganda aimed like a cannon at white survival. Where did this insufferable &#8220;let&rsquo;s all just get along&#8221; babysitter mindset first come from, anyway? NO concern is shown for European civilization or the real wants and needs of the people who built it. How can the commie media report COLONIZATION and INVASION as &#8220;immigration&#8221;? Their very buzzwords are the depths of mendacity! <br>
    How can they accuse anybody else of hatemongering when it is they who have turned it into a huge, prestigious, highly unified global industry? </p>

			<p>Europe&rsquo;s problems do not end with Muslims. All genetically non European peoples have no right to settle in Europe (they may visit in small numbers) and must leave Europe. Until that happens, our struggle will never end. </p>

			<p>I loved the observation about an &#8220;Arab Go Home&#8221; mural in Austria. Would love to see some billboards with that text along Interstates 95 and 85 here in Florida.</p>

			<p>Sarkozy has an arrogant, abrasive manner and is intensely concerned with his image and with manipulating the media. <br>
He just gave an interview in which he &#8220;zapped it to the Anglo-Saxons&#8221;. This is surprising after he had been so cozy with Bush.</p>
<p><i>The British and the Americans came in for harsh treatment. &hellip;Sarkozy also said he would refuse to &#8220;pay America&rsquo;s debt&#8221; and he demanded US agreement to radical reforms of the world financial system. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not going to get away with explaining that everything is going to go on as before.&#8221; <br>
  <br>
You hear the same points about the US and Britain all over Europe, but not usually from heads of state. Sarkozy&rsquo;s relations with Gordon Brown and Barack Obama are clearly not so rosy as we thought.</i><br>

			<p>The only thing that will drive the Muslims out of europe will be the European civilians resorting to violence to do so.  The European politician are traitors and will not reverse the situation they created.  Once enough Muslims fall the survivors will flee and their countrymen will stay home.  History tell us that foreign invaders are always repulsed theough the use of force&hellip;  </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s &#8220;scary&#8221; about it?   The alternative looks far more scary to me.</p>

<p>The &#8220;civil war&#8221; will be conducted between the drug cartels and the muslims.</p>

			<p>Where is the Amren poster who used to promote the idea of moving to some place like Germany or Austria? <br>
I wonder what the situation is like there now. <br>
I ask because I&rsquo;m thinking about moving near there!</p>
<p>I just had a conversation with a friend from Germany, she says the black muslim Turks are invading the place and it is worse that the papers say it is. She also says the NAZI party is making a good showing in local politics in recent times because of it&rsquo;s stand against immigration.</p>
