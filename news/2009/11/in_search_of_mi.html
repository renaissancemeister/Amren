<p>Milenio (Mexico City) 11/11/09</p>
<p>  &mdash;  full transatio.  &mdash;  Members of the Mexican American Coalition for Migratory reform are in Guadalajara. Their objective is to reach an integral migratory reform for the undocumented Mexicans in the United States, which affects 12 million Mexicans who represent 50 percent of the immigrants who live in the United States, said Lorena Colin, national coordinator.</p>
<p>Alfredo Cuellar, professor at Fresno State University, asserted that the reform will be brought about &#8220;but the question is, when? Every second that goes by, the Mexican brothers suffer history&rsquo;s most terrible hounding and harassment.&#8221; The group&rsquo;s members said that the abuses and the discrimination toward those who lack documents are part of everyday life. &#8220;People live in terror. They are the so called modern slaves. They drive in fear while taking their children to school; they go to work; from there they return home and they don&rsquo;t leave until the following day. They stay at home for fear that it might be the immigration police who knocks at the door,&#8221; commented Raul Murillo.</p>
<p>They said that even though President Barack Obama promised, while campaigning, to work on the issue during the first year of his mandate, they have not seen support from him and they pointed out that deportations have increased 47 percent since he became president. Murillo said that even though the round-ups of several years ago are no longer carried out, there is a search for citizens (sic) and they find them in their own homes. But he mentioned that 80 percent of those who return to Mexico were found while other citizens [We believe the speaker quoted here is using the term &#8220;citizens&#8221; to refer to fellow Mexicans] were being sought. What obligates Mexicans to leave the country is lack of opportunities, they said. Mario Hernandez said: &#8220;I urge the federal, state and municipal government to promote employment in Mexico: the long term solution to the migratory problem is to create jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>What silly nonsense. If one enters another country by breaking its&rsquo; immigration laws, then one is subject to deporation and other problems. These people can solve all their problem by not breaking another nation&rsquo;s imigration laws and going home.</p>
<p>&#8220;What obligates Mexicans to leave the country is lack of opportunities, they said. Mario Hernandez said: &ldquo;I urge the federal, state and municipal government to promote employment in Mexico: the long term solution to the migratory problem is to create jobs.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>THAT is the job of the Mexican government, not the American government. </p>

<p>LOL  &mdash;  Comrade General Secretary BO truly is incompetent!</p>
<p>Even when he is clearly attempting to destroy the country, he messes things up. This is no small misadventure on his part either; to destroy anything is much easier than it is building up something, please remember. With the peons of Mexico flooding in like water through a sieve and himself in charge of the INS, one would think that at least even he could get this right.</p>
<p>Well, I thank God daily that if we had to have a black president, it was this callow Red fool. He is obliterating himself before our very eyes and is too stupid to know he is doing so, even with his own base of anti-white/nonwhite entitlement marauders. The only problem being, it is just not going quick enough, I am afraid!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>The fact that the illegal aliens stay here proves that they&rsquo;re not hounded and harassed enough.  But local policemen and sheriffs who try to enforce immigration law <i>are</i> hounded and harassed   &mdash;   by the federal government.</p>

		<p>&#8220;American prof: Illegals &ldquo;suffer history&rsquo;s most terrible hounding and harassment.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I wonder why none of the Mex academics is ever concerned about the treatment illegals receive in Mexico which prompts them to sneak into this country?</p>
<p>I wonder why the US media NEVER points this out also?</p>

		<p>Well, if they know it&rsquo;s going to be that bad when they get here, why don&rsquo;t they just stay home and work for changes in their OWN government, instead of trying to barge in here to make demands on ours???</p>

		<p>This article is absolutely ridiculous. It&rsquo;s just beyond absurd on so many levels. They live in terror? REALLY? While driving (chances are they have no licenses) their kids to school (a free education that OUR tax dollars pay for) then go to work ( which they are not legally eligible to do) then come home and stay (I&rsquo;ve never seen a shortage of them out shopping) for fear the immigration police may come knocking (although the round ups have stopped) and don&rsquo;t leave their home until the next day.</p>
<p>Oh the terror! And now on top of expecting us to feel sorry for them, they want us to create jobs in Mexico? Insanity.</p>

<p>Right - - THEY are the victims.</p>
<p>By my calculations about seven Americans are killed EVERYDAY in this country by Mexicasn illegal aliens driving drunk and causing a fatal accident.</p>
<p>But the illegal alien - - IS THE VICTIM!! &#8220;Right&#8221;!! &#8220;Sure&#8221;!!</p>
<p>My calculation is based upon the stat that about 15 % of all convicts in federal prisons are illegal aliens. About 15 % of all crime can be attributed to illegals? Including 15 % of all fatal drunk driving deaths where someone is killed by a drunk driver. 17,000 / 365 * 0.15 = 7.<br>
